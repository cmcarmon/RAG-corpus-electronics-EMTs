e x a m p l e 9.12 r e l a y A relay is constructed as an electromagnet that
opens and closes a mechanical switch. Suppose that the electromagnet can be mod-
eled as an inductor having a 10-mH inductance. Suppose further that it will close the
mechanical switch once its current reaches 10 mA. What voltage step must be applied
to the electromagnet to close the switch in 100 Âµs?
