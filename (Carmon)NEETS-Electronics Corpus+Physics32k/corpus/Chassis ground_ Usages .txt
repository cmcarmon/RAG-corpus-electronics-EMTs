Electronics
Most electronics systems have their circuits reference-linked to the chassis while the chassis itself is often, but not always, linked to the Earth.
Motor vehicles
Most motor vehicles use the chassis as the reference for all electrical peripherals which allow the use of only one wire for each accessory.
