To determine the sensitivity of a meter movement, you need only to divide 1 by the amount of
current needed to cause full-scale deflection of the meter movement. The manufacturer usually marks
meter movements with the amount of current needed for full-scale deflection and the resistance of the
meter. With these figures, you can calculate the sensitivity
