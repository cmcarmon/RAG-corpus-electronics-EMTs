Another kind of memory used inside computers is called random-access memory (RAM) or 
read/write memory. RAM memory is rather like a blackboard on which you can scribble down notes, read 
them, and rub them out when you are finished with them. In the computer, RAM is the working memory. 
Data can be read (retrieved) from or written (stored) into RAM just by giving the computer the address of 
the location where the data is stored or is to be stored. When the data is no longer needed, you can simply 
write over it. This allows you to use the storage again for something else. Core, semiconductor, and 
bubble storage all have random access capabilities.
