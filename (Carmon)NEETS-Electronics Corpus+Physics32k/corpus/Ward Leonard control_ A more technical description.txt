The speed of a DC motor is controlled by varying the voltage fed to the generator field windings, Vgf, which varies the output voltage of the generator. The varied output voltage will change the voltage of the motor, since they are connected directly through the armature. Consequently, changing the Vgf will control the speed of the motor. The picture on the right shows the Ward Leonard control system, with the Vgf feeding the generator and Vmf feeding the motor.
