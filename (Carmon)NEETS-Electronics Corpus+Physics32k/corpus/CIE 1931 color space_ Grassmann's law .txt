One might ask: "Why is it possible that Wright and Guild's results can be summarized using different primaries and different intensities from those actually used?" One might also ask: "What about the case when the test colors being matched are not monochromatic?" The answer to both of these questions lies in the (near) linearity of human color perception. This linearity is expressed in Grassmann's law.
The CIE RGB space can be used to define chromaticity in the usual way: The chromaticity coordinates are r and g where:




r
=


R

R
+
G
+
B



,


{\displaystyle r={\frac {R}{R+G+B}},}





g
=


G

R
+
G
+
B



.


{\displaystyle g={\frac {G}{R+G+B}}.}
