Theorem 12.8
The Nyquist stability criterion. Assume that TF1 has a bounded response diagram L(TF1). If TF1 has n poles
in the right half of the s-plane, where Re(s) > 0, then H has r + n poles in the right half of the s-plane where
Re(s) > 0 if the point 1/k + j · 0 is not on L(TF1), and L(TF1) encircles 1/k + j · 0 r times in the clockwise sense.
