Sensors  serve  an  important  function  in  biomedical  instrumentation  systems  in  that  they  provide  the  interface
between the electronic instrument and the biologic system being measured. Very often the quality of the instrument
is based upon the quality of the sensor at the instrumentâ€™s front end. Although electronic signal processing has been
developed to a high level, the signals are no better than the quality of the sensors that provide them. Although there
have been many advances in biomedical sensor technology, many problems remain. Biomedical sensors will continue
to be an import area for research and development in biomedical engineering.
