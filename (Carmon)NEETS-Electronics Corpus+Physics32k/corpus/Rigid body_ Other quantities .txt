If C is the origin of a local coordinate system L, attached to the body,
the spatial or twist acceleration of a rigid body is defined as the spatial acceleration of C (as opposed to material acceleration above);

where






r


0




{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} _{0}}
represents the position of the point/particle with respect to the reference point of the body in terms of the local coordinate system L (the rigidity of the body means that this does not depend on time)




A
(
t
)



{\displaystyle A(t)\,}
is the orientation matrix, an orthogonal matrix with determinant 1, representing the orientation (angular position) of the local coordinate system L, with respect to the arbitrary reference orientation of another coordinate system G. Think of this matrix as three orthogonal unit vectors, one in each column, which define the orientation of the axes of L with respect to G.

ψ


c


(
t
)


{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\psi }}_{c}(t)}
represents the spatial acceleration of the rigid body (i.e. the spatial acceleration of the origin of L).
In 2D, the angular velocity is a scalar, and matrix A(t) simply represents a rotation in the xy-plane by an angle which is the integral of the angular velocity over time.
Vehicles, walking people, etc., usually rotate according to changes in the direction of the velocity: they move forward with respect to their own orientation. Then, if the body follows a closed orbit in a plane, the angular velocity integrated over a time interval in which the orbit is completed once, is an integer times 360°. This integer is the winding number with respect to the origin of the velocity. Compare the amount of rotation associated with the vertices of a polygon.
