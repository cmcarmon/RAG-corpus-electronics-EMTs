While the physical configurations of radar systems differ, any radar system can be represented by the
functional block diagram in figure 1-16. An actual radar set may have several of these functional
components within one physical unit, or a single one of these functions may require several physical
units. However, the functional block diagram of a basic radar set may be used to analyze the operation of
almost any radar set.
