The Concept of Track
The information on magnetic and optical disks is recorded along tracks. Typically, a track is a narrow annulus
at  some  distance r  from  the  disk  center.  The  width  of  the  annulus  is  denoted  by Wt,  while  the  width  of  the
guard band, if any, between adjacent tracks is denoted by Wg . The track pitch is the center-to-center distance
between neighboring tracks and is therefore equal to Wt + Wg . A major difference between the magnetic ﬂoppy
disk, the magnetic hard disk, and the optical disk is that their respective track pitches are presently of the order
of 100, 10, and 1 mm. Tracks may be ﬁctitious entities, in the sense that no independent existence outside the
pattern of recorded marks may be ascribed to them. This is the case, for example, with the audio compact disk
format where prerecorded marks simply deﬁne their own tracks and help guide the laser beam during readout.
In the other extreme are tracks that are physically engraved on the disk surface before any data is ever recorded.
Examples  of  this  type  of  track  are  provided  by  pregrooved WORM  and  magneto-optical  disks.  Figure 80.22
shows micrographs from several recorded optical disk surfaces. The tracks along which the data are written are
clearly visible in these pictures.
