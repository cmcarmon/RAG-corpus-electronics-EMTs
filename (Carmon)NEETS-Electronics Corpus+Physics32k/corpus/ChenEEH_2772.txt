for all possible real values of ~kk (i.e., those numerical waves
having zero exponential attenuation per grid space cell). The
xupper bound is obtained when each sin2 term under the square
root of 9.68 simultaneously reaches a value of 1. This occurs
for the propagating numerical wave having the wave vector
components:
