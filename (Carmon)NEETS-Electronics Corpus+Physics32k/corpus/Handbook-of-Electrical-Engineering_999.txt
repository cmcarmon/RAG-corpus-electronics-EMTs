The triplet sets of parameters for incorporating geometry dependence into the BSIM model, (13.6), allow
an alternate strategy. We obtain sets of parameters without geometry dependence by ﬁtting to individual devices
without  using  the  ParL  and  ParW  terms.  We  do  this  for  each  device  size  individually.  This  produces  sets  of
parameters relevant to each individual device. So, for device number 1 of width W(1) and length L(1) we would
have a value for the parameter VFB which we will call VFB(1); for device number n of width W(n) and length
L(n) we will have VFB(n). To get the Par0, ParL, and VFBW we ﬁt to the “data points” VFB(1), . . .,VFB(n) with
parameters VFB0, VFBL, and VFBW using (13.6) where Leff and Weff are different for each index, 1 through n.
Note that as L and W become very large, the parameters must approach Par0. This suggests that we use the
parameter values for the wide-long device as the Par0 terms and only ﬁt the other geometry sizes to get the
ParL  and  ParW  terms.  For  example,  if  we  have  obtained VFB(1)  for  our  ﬁrst  device  which  is  our  wide-long
device, we would set VFB0 = VFB(1), and then ﬁt to VFB(2), . . .,VBF(n) with parameters VFBL and VFBW, and
similarly for all the other triplets of parameters. In order to use a general least-squares optimization program
in this way the software must be capable of specifying parameters as targets, as well as measured data points.
