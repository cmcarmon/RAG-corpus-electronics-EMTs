The Local Group of galaxies is moving relative to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at 631±20 km/s.
There is also a pattern of bulk flow in the motion of neighboring galaxies extending to distances of over 250 megaparsecs (Mpc). There is a known overdensity – the Shapley Supercluster – creating an attraction in the flow of galaxies.
Fundamentally gravitation is always attractive, but if there is an underdense region it apparently acts as a gravitational repeller. That's because there is less attraction in the direction of the underdensity, and the greater attraction due to the higher density in other directions acts to pull objects away from the underdensity.
The repeller appears to be located at a distance of about 220 Mpc and is anticipated to coincide with a void in galaxy density.
That single center of attraction along with a roughly equal single repeller appear to be the most significant contributors to the CMB dipole.
