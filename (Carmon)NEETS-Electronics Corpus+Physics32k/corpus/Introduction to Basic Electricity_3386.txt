  5.  Remove the short between the gate and the anode. 
If a low-resistance range of the ohmmeter is used, 
the resistance should stay low. If a high-resistance 
range is used, the resistance should return to 
above 1 megohm. In the higher resistance ranges, 
the ohmmeter does not supply enough current to 
keep the gate latched (turned on) when the short 
is removed.
