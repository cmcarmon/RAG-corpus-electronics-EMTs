Unfortunately, a great deal of physical intuition is often required to use this approach effectively. To date,
we  have  only  seen  it  applied  to  the  simpler  MOS  models  such  as  level  3.  It  is  not  known  if  this  is  a  viable
approach for a much more complicated model such as BSIM2 [Power et al., 1993].
