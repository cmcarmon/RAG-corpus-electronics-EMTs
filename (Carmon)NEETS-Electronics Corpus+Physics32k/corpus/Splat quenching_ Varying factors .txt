Some varying factors in splat quenching are the drop size and velocity of the metal in ensuring the complete solidification of the metal. In cases where the volume of the drop is too large or the velocity is too slow, the metal will not solidify past equilibrium causing it to remelt. Therefore, experiments are carried out to determine the precise volume and velocity of the droplet that will ensure complete solidification of a certain metal. Intrinsic and extrinsic factors influencing the glass-forming ability of metallic alloys were analyzed and classified.
