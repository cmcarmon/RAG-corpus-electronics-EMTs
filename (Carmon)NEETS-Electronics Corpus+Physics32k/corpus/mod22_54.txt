Electromechanical computers came next and differ from mechanical computers in that they use 
electrical components to perform some of the calculations and to increase the accuracy. Because the 
electrical components are smaller than their mechanical counterparts, the size of the computer was 
reduced, even though it performs more functions. The components used to perform the calculations are 
devices such as synchros, servos, resolvers, amplifiers, servo amplifiers, summing networks, 
potentiometers, and linear potentiometers. Figure 1-3 shows one of the Navy's electromechanical 
computers. These computers are used in gun fire control and missile fire control. Even though they are 
better than the mechanical computer, they still have their drawbacks. Of prime importance is that they are 
special-purpose computers. This means they can only be used for one job, dependent on their design 
characteristics. By today's Navy standards they are still too large, and the maintenance time on them is 
excessive. The need for a more accurate, reliable, versatile, and smaller computer was recognized.
