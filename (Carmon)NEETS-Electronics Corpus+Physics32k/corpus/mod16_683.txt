Before using an attenuator probe for measurement of high-frequency signals or for fast-rising
waveforms, you must adjust the probe compensating capacitor (C1) according to instructions in the
applicable technical manual. Some probes will have an IMPEDANCE EQUALIZER in the end of the
cable that attaches to the oscilloscope. The impedance equalizer, when adjusted according to
manufacturerâ€™s instructions, assures proper impedance matching between the probe and oscilloscope. An
improperly adjusted impedance equalizer will result in erroneous measurements, especially when you are
measuring high frequencies or fast-rising signals.
