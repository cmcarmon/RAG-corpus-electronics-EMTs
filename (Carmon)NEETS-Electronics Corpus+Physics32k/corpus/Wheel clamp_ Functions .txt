Wheel clamps have five main functions:
To punish unauthorised or illegal parking, in lieu of towing the offending vehicle; in these cases, police or property owners who place the clamp may charge a high "release fee" to remove it
For security purposes, such as preventing a car, trailer, or caravan from being driven or towed away by a thief
To preclude escape of a prosecuted person
To prevent driving by a suspended driver or moving of a disabled vehicle
To enforce unpaid fines previously applied to the vehicle; a certain number of nonpayments or time elapsed from the issuance of the most recent fine results in clamping upon the next violation
