Analog Data and Digital Signal
An example of the combination is the T1 carrier carrying voice
signal from a switching local ofﬁce to another switching local
ofﬁce via a tandem switch. The voice is converted into a stream
of digital bits that are carried by digital signal with some
encoding scheme. The receiving system would then convert
the stream of digital bits back to the original analog voice.
Another example of the combination is compact disc audio.
