deﬁnition language (HDL) approaches. Models can be gener-
ated from ANSYS ﬁnite element codes or from written analyt-
ical equations. Behavior models and scalable symbolic views
can be generated. Verilog-A models can also be generated.
MEMS Xplorer in MEMSCaP offers a complete environment
for MEMS design by combining leading-edge IC design envir-
onment (CADENCE) and FEM tools (ANSYS). The generated
model can be used to perform optimization simulations inside
the environment or to realize a system-level simulation. In
addition, emulators are available for isotropic or anisotropic
etching and for sacriﬁcial etching.
