For future microprocessor applications, there are many power
management issues that need to be addressed, such as those
concerning VRM topologies, power device technologies, and
packaging technologies. To meet future requirements, VRMs
should have high-power densities, high efÔ¨Åciencies, and fast
transient performances. To achieve this target, advanced VRM
topologies, advanced power devices, and advanced packaging
technologies must be developed.
