Planar resonators may conveniently be classiﬁed as transmis-
sion line resonators and patch resonators. Figure 7.27 shows
three typical planar transmission line resonators. Their line
length is always commensurate with wavelength. Figure 7.28
illustrates two examples of patch resonators. The transmission
line resonators consist of sections of line having the physical
length equal to a certain fraction of the guided-wave wave-
length. A closed ring geometry where the electrical
length
equals an integer multiple of the wavelength also acts as a
resonator. For open-ended planar resonators, the fringing
ﬁeld effects at the open end introduce an effective lengthening
of the line and, thus, lower the resonant frequency. This effect
must be taken into account in the calculation. Hence, resonant
modes of such resonators may be considered to have approxi-
mately a one-dimensional dependency. This is quite different
for the resonance condition of a patch resonator, which
depends on both length and width of
the patch (two-
dimensional problem).
