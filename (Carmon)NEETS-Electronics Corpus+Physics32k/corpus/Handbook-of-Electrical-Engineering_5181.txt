The vibration sensor used can be either a conventional transducer (such as resistive, capacitive, inductive,
or optical displacement versions) or it can be a smart sensor by itself. For example, an optical ﬁber with a leaky
sheath (which permits the light energy to leak from the core to the outside surface) can be imbedded in the
parent structure. When the structure is deformed, the extent of light leakage from the ﬁber to the surrounding
material  will  modify  proportionately.  Hence,  the  detected  light  signal  from  the  ﬁber  optics,  when  detected,
delivers information on the deformation or the dynamic structural characteristics of the test beam. This sensor
can  be  made  smart  by  integrating  a  distributed  set  of  ﬁbers  that  can  sense  strain,  vibration,  temperature,  if
needed, and so on, so that the network implemented with appropriate algorithms will provide exhaustive data
for a comprehensive adaptive feedback control strategy.
