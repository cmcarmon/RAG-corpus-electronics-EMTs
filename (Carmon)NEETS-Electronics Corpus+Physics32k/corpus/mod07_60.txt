Power is also a two-sided story. For low-power applications, where efficiency is a significant factor,
semiconductors have a decided advantage. This is true mainly because semiconductor devices perform
very well with an extremely small amount of power; in addition, they require no filaments or heaters as in
the case of the electron tube. For example, a computer operating with over 4000 solid-state devices may
require no more than 20 watts of power. However, the same number of tubes would require several
kilowatts of power.
