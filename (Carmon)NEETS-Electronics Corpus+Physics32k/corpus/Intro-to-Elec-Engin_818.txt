In the United States power is generated by many generating stations interconnected in an
overall network, known as the power grid, which spans the entire country. The bulk of the system
is privately owned, whereas a part of the network is owned federally and a part municipally. Some
utility companies in a given geographical area operate as power pools for reasons of economy
and reliability.
