BASIC (Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code) was designed as a teaching language to 
help beginning programmers write programs. Therefore, it is a general-purpose, introductory language 
that is fairly easy to learn and to use. With the increase in the use of microcomputers, BASIC has 
regained popularity and is available on most microcomputer systems.
