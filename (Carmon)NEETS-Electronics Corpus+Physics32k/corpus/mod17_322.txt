Receiving antenna distribution systems operate at low power levels and are built to fit a standard 19-
inch rack. Each piece of distribution equipment is fitted with termination or patch fittings designed for 
ease of connecting and disconnecting. A basic patch panel is shown in figure 3-11. Even a fundamental 
distribution system has several antenna transmission lines and several receivers. Normally a patch panel 
consists of two basic patch panels. One panel is used to terminate the antenna transmission lines and the 
other the lines leading to the receivers. Any antenna can be patched to any receiver through the use of 
patch cords.
