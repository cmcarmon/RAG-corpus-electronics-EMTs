biquad (see Figure 4.6 without the summer). As a result, we
conclude that the performance of this simulated ladder can
be expected to be similarly insensitive to the op-amp’s ﬁnite
gain-bandwidth products. Using 741-type op-amps with
ft  1:5 MHz, the performance of the active circuit is accept-
able to over 300 kHz, and the performance of the two circuits
in Figure 4.15(A) and 4.15(C) is experimentally indistinguish-
able until about 90 kHz when the op-amp effects begin to be
noticeable. As a ﬁnal comment, observe that the output Vout
in the active realization is inverting. If this phase shift of
1808 is not acceptable, the output may be taken at the node
labeled V2.
