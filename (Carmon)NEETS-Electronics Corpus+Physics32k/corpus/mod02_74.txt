 Since all circuits have conductors in them, you can assume that all circuits have inductance. 
However, inductance has its greatest effect only when there is a change in current. Inductance does NOT 
oppose current, only a CHANGE in current. Where current is constantly changing as in an ac circuit, 
inductance has more effect.
