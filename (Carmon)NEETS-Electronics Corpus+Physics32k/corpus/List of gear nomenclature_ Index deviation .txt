The displacement of any tooth flank from its theoretical position, relative to a datum tooth flank.
Distinction is made as to the direction and algebraic sign of this reading. A condition wherein the actual tooth flank position was nearer to the datum tooth flank, in the specified measuring path direction (clockwise or counterclockwise), than the theoretical position would be considered a minus (-) deviation. A condition wherein the actual tooth flank position was farther from the datum tooth flank, in the specified measuring path direction, than the theoretical position would be considered a plus (+) deviation.
The direction of tolerancing for index deviation along the arc of the tolerance diameter circle within the transverse plane.
