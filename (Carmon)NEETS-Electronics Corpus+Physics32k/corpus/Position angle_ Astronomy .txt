The parallactic angle of astronomy is the position angle of the zenith (considered the target position) as seen from the star (considered the starting position), where the North Celestial Pole (NCP) of the celestial sphere defines the reference direction. The sign of the angle is basically kept, north over east in both cases, but as astronomers look at stars from the inside of the celestial sphere, the definition uses the convention that the q is the angle in an image that turns the direction to the NCP counterclockwise into the direction of the zenith.
