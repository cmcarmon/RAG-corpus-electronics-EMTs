When a 115-volt ac excitation voltage is applied to the rotor of a synchro transmitter, such as the one 
shown in figure 1-13, the resultant current produces an ac magnetic field around the rotor winding. The 
lines of force cut through the turns of the three stator windings and, by transformer action, induce voltage 
into the stator coils. The effective voltage induced in any stator coil depends upon the angular position of 
that coil's axis with respect to the rotor axis. When the maximum effective coil voltage is known, the 
effective voltage induced into a stator coil at any angular displacement can be determined.
