When you speak of the dB level of a signal, you are really speaking of a logarithmic comparison 
between the input and output signals. The input signal is normally used as the reference level. However, 
the application sometimes requires the use of a standard reference signal. The most widely used reference 
level is a 1-milliwatt signal. The standard decibel abbreviation of dB is changed to dBm to indicate the 
use of the 1-milliwatt standard reference. Thus, a signal level of +3 dBm is 3 dB above 1 milliwatt, and a 
signal level of −3 dBm is 3 dB below 1 milliwatt. Whether using dB or dBm, a plus (+) sign (or no sign at 
all) indicates the output signal is larger than the reference; a minus (−) sign indicates the output signal is 
less than the reference.
