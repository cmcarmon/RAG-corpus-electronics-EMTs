In figure 2-10, the power-amplifier chain input signals are generated by heterodyning (mixing) two
frequencies. That is, two different frequencies are fed to a mixer stage (mixer amplifier) and the resultant,
either the sum or difference frequency, may be selected as the output. (The operation of mixer circuits is
explained in more detail in the section on receivers.) The low-power pulse is then amplified by
intermediate power amplifier stages and applied to the klystron power-amplifier. The klystron power-
amplifier concentrates the rf output energy into a very narrow frequency spectrum. This concentration
makes the system more sensitive to smaller targets. In addition the detection range of all targets is
increased.
