There is no single acceptable deﬁnition of the term electric
power quality. The term generally applies to the goodness of
the electric power supply, its voltage regulation, its frequency,
voltage wave shape, current wave shape, level of impulses and
noise, and the absence of momentary outages. Some engineers
include reliability considerations in electric power quality stud-
ies, some consider electromagnetic compatibility, and some per-
form generation supply studies. Narrower deﬁnitions of electric
power quality generally focus on the bus voltage wave shape.
