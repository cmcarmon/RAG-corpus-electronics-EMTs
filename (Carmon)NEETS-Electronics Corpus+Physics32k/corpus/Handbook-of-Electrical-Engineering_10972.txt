A sinusoidal current is a special case of a biphasic stimulus. Sinusoidal threshold response can be represented
by strength-frequency curves, as shown by the solid curves in Fig. 113.7 for the myelinated nerve model. Several
experimental curves have been included in the Ô¨Ågure; these have been shifted vertically to facilitate comparisons.
Notice that the myelinated nerve model predicts a lower threshold for stimulation by a continuous sine wave
as compared with a single cycle.
