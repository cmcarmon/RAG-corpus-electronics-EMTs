As we discussed earlier, an inductor has the ability to act as a storehouse of magnetic energy.
However, because of the various loss factors described above, all of the energy stored in the magnetic
field is not returned to the source when the applied voltage decreases to zero. The losses of an inductor
may be represented by an equivalent series resistance. The value that it would dissipate would be an
amount of energy equal to the total amount dissipated by the inductor. The losses of an inductor may be
expressed in terms of the ratio of its inductive reactance to its equivalent series resistance. This ratio is
referred to as the Q of the inductor and is stated in equation form as shown below:
