Grounding and Bypassing on D/A and A/D ICs
D/A and A/D converter ICs require correct grounding and capacitive bypassing in order to operate according
to  performance  speciÔ¨Åcations.  The  digital  signals  can  severely  impair  analog  signals.  To  combat  the  electro-
magnetic interference induced by the digital signals, the analog and digital grounds should be kept separate
and should have only one common point on the circuit board. If possible, this common point should be the
connection to the power supply.
