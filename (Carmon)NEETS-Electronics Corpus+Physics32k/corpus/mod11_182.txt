In figure 2-33 the alternate segments between cavities are assumed to be at the same potential at the 
same instant. An ac field is assumed to exist across each individual cavity. This mode of operation is 
called the PI MODE, since adjacent segments of the anode have a phase difference of 180 degrees, or 
one-pi radian. Several other modes of oscillation are possible, but a magnetron operating in the pi mode 
has greater power and output and is the most commonly used.
