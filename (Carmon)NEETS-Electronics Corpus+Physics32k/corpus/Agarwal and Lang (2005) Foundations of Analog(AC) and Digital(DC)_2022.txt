the circuit behaves like an inductor. This is not surprising since
That is,
the effect of the smallest impedance in a parallel circuit dominates. Relating
back to the frequency response, Equation 14.35 further implies that the low-
frequency asymptote of the magnitude plot will resemble that of an inductor
(see Figure 13.9).
