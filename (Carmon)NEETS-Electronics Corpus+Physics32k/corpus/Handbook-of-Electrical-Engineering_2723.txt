Routing Techniques
Given a collection of cells placed on a chip, the routing problem is to connect the terminals (or ports) of these
cells  for  a  speciﬁc  design  requirement.  The  routing  problem  is  often  divided  into  three  subproblems:  global,
detailed, and specialized routers. The global router considers the overall routing region in order to distribute the
nets over the channels based on their capacities while keeping the length of each net as short as possible. For
every channel that a net passes through, the net’s id is placed on the sides of the channel. Once the terminals of
each channel are determined, the detailed router connects all the terminals with the same id by a set of wire
segments. (A wire segment is a piece of material described by a layer, two end-points, and a width.) The specialized
router is designed to solve a speciﬁc problem such as routing of power and ground wires. These wires require
special attention for two reasons: 1) they are usually routed in one layer in order to reduce the parasitic capacitance
of contacts, and 2) they are usually wider than other wires (signal and data) since they carry more current.
