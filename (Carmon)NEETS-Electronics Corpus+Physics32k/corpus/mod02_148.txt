A simple capacitor consists of two metal plates separated by an insulating material called a dielectric,
as illustrated in figure 3-4. Note that one plate is connected to the positive terminal of a battery; the other
plate is connected through a closed switch (S1) to the negative terminal of the battery. Remember, an
insulator is a material whose electrons cannot easily escape their orbits. Due to the battery voltage, plate A is
charged positively and plate B is charged negatively. (How this happens is explained later in this chapter.)
Thus an electrostatic field is set up between the positive and negative plates. The electrons on the negative
plate (plate B) are attracted to the positive charges on the positive plate (plate A).
