According to the proposed new SI definitions, including a new definition of the mole through giving the Avogadro constant an exact numerical value, and assuming that the definition of an atomic mass unit (one twelfth of the rest mass of an unbound neutral atom of carbon-12 in its nuclear and electronic ground state) does not change, the molar mass constant, while still with great accuracy remaining equal to 1 g/mol, will no longer be exactly equal to that.
