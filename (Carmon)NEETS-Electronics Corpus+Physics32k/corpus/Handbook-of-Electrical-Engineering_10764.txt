A parallel structure consisting of n units is shown in Fig. 110.3. From the reliability point of view, the system
will succeed if any one of the n units succeeds. Once again, the units may or may not be physically or topologically
in parallel. If Qi is the probability of failure of the ith unit, then the parallel system reliability Rp is given as
