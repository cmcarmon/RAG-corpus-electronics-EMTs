The opposition offered to current flow by an induc-
tor in an AC circuit is called inductive	reactance 
and is measured in ohms. The amount of  inductive 
reactance offered by an inductor depends on its 
 inductance and the frequency of the applied voltage. 
The larger the inductance, the larger the magnetic  
field generated and the greater the opposition to 
 current flow. Also, the higher the frequency, the 
greater the opposition the inductor has to current flow.
Inductive reactance is expressed by the symbol XL
