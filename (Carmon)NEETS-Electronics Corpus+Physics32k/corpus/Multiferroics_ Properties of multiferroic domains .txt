In contrast to materials with a single ferroic order, domains in multiferroics have additional properties and functionalities. For instance, they are characterized by an assembly of at least two order parameters. The order parameters may be independent (typical yet not mandatory for a split-order-parameter multiferroic) or coupled (mandatory for a joint-order-parameter multiferroic).
Many outstanding properties that distinguish domains in multiferroics from those in materials with a single ferroic order are consequences of the coupling between the order parameters.
The coupling can lead to patterns with a distribution and/or topology of domains that is exclusive to multiferroics.
The order-parameter coupling is usually homogeneous across a domain, i.e., gradient effects are negligible.
In some cases the averaged net value of the order parameter for a domain pattern is more relevant for the coupling than the value of the order parameter of an individual domain.
These issues lead to novel functionalities which explain the current interest in these materials.
