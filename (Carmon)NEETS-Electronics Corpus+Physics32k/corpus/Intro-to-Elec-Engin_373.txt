*4.2.2 Consider a three-phase 25-kVA, 440-V, 60-Hz
alternator operating at full load (i.e., delivering
its rated kVA) under balanced steady-state condi-
tions. Find the magnitudes of the alternator line
current and phase current.
(a) If the generator windings are wye-connected.
(b) If the generator windings are delta-connected.
4.2.3 Let the alternator of Problem 4.2.2 supply a line
current of 20 A at a power factor of 0.8 lagging.
Determine:
(a) The kVA supplied by the machine.
(b) The real power kW delivered by the generator.
(c) The reactive power kVAR delivered by the
