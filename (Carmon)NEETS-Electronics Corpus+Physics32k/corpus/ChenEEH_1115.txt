This class of reliability testing, however, rarely duplicates the
conditions that will actually be encountered by MEMS com-
ponents in their ‘‘real-world’’ employment. Further, companies
that do lifetime and reliability testing on their devices are often
reluctant to disclose the data, the methods by which the data
were obtained, or the conditions of the tests.
