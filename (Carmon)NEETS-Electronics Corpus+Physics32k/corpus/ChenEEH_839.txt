poral ordering. This strict ordering is enforced by a global
synchronization signal known as the clock signal that must
be delivered to every register at a precise relative time. The
delivery function is accomplished by a circuit and interconnect
structure commonly known as a clock distribution network
(Friedman, 1995, 1997).
