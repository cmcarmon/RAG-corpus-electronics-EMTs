The zener diode establishes the voltage level at 
which the SCR turns on. It protects the load from 
voltage above the zener voltage. As long as the supply 
voltage is less than the zener diode voltage rating, the 
diode does not conduct. This keeps the SCR turned off.
If the supply voltage rises above the zener voltage due 
to a malfunction, the zener diode conducts. This creates 
a gate current to the SCR, turning it on and shorting out
