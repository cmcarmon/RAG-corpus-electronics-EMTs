Figure 3-26, view A, shows a typical four-stage ring counter. This particular counter is composed of
R-S FFs. J-K FFs may be used as well. Notice that the output of each AND gate is input to the R, or reset
side, of the nearest FF and to the S, or set side, of the next FF. The Q output of each FF is applied to the B
input of the AND gate that is connected to its own R input.
