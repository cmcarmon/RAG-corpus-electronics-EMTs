Magnitudes and Signs of Electrostrictive Coefﬁcients
The values of M coefﬁcients range from about 10–24 m2/V2 in low-permittivity materials to 10–16 m2/V2 in high-
permittivity actuator materials made from relaxor ferroelectrics such as PMN–lead titanate (PMN–PT) com-
positions.  Large  strains  of  the  order  of  strains  in  ferroelectric  piezoelectric  materials  such  as  lead  zirconate
titanate (PZT) may be induced in these materials. Q values vary in an opposite way to M values. Q ranges from
10–3  m4/C2 in  relaxor  ferroelectrics  to  greater  than  1  m4/C2 in  low-permittivity  materials.  Since  the  strain  is
directly  proportional  to  the  square  of  the  induced  polarization,  it  is  also  proportional  to  the  square  of  the
dielectric permittivity. This implies that materials with large dielectric permittivities, like relaxor ferroelectrics,
can produce large strains despite having small Q coefﬁcients.
