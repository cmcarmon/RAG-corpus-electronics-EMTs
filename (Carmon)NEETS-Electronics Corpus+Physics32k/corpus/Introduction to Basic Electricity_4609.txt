output (S) is produced with the XOR gate. The inputs 
A and B are connected to both the AND gate and the 
XOR gate. The truth table for the circuit is the same 
as the truth table developed using the binary addi-
tion rules (Figure 45-17). Because the circuit does not 
take into account any carries, it is referred to as a half 
adder.  It can be used as the LSB adder for a binary 
addition problem.
