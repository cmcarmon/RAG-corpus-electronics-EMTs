Trigonometrical equations 
 
Equations that involve trigonometrical expressions 
are  known 
equations. 
Fortunately  they  are  not  quite  so  difficult  to 
understand as they sound! Consider the equation: 
 
sin 8 = 0.5 
 
This  equation  can  be  solved  quite  easily  using  a 
calculator. However, before doing so,  you  need to 
be  sure  to  select  the  correct  mode  for  expressing 
angles  on  your  calculator.  If  you  are  using  a 
‘scientific calculator’ you will find that you can set 
the  angular  mode  to  either  radian  measure  or 
degrees. A little later we will explain the difference 
between  these  two  angular  measures  but  for  the 
time being we shall use degrees. 
 
If  you solve the equation (by  keying in 0.5 and 
pressing the inverse sine function keys) you should 
see  the  result  30°  displayed  on  your  calculator. 
Hence we can conclude that: 
 
sin 30°  = 0.5 
 
Actually,  a  number  of  other  angles  will  give  the 
same result! Try pressing the sine function key and 
entering the following angles in turn: 
 
30°, 210°, 390° and 570° 
They should all produce the same result, 0.5! This 
should  suggest  to  you  that  the  graph  of  the  sine
