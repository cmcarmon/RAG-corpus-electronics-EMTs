In this case, as discussed earlier, CGS2 is initially charged to 5 volts. We
need to determine the time taken for the capacitor voltage to drop from 5 to
VOL = 1 volts.
When the input is high, Figure 10.22 shows the equivalent circuit. Let us
denote the Thévenin equivalent resistance RL(cid:7)RON as RTH, and the Thévenin
equivalent voltage VSRON/(RON+ RL) as VTH. Let us also denote the capacitor
voltage vOUT1 by vC, and the current through the circuit by iC as shown in
Figure 10.23.
