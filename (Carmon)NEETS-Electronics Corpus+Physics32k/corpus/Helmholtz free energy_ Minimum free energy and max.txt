The laws of thermodynamics are most easily applicable to systems undergoing reversible processes or processes that begin and end in thermal equilibrium, although irreversible quasistatic processes or spontaneous processes in systems with uniform temperature and pressure (uPT processes) can also be analyzed based on the fundamental thermodynamic relation as shown further below. First, if we wish to describe phenomena like chemical reactions, it may be convenient to consider suitably chosen initial and final states in which the system is in (metastable) thermal equilibrium. If the system is kept at fixed volume and is in contact with a heat bath at some constant temperature, then we can reason as follows.
Since the thermodynamical variables of the system are well defined in the initial state and the final state, the internal energy increase



Δ
U


{\displaystyle \Delta U}
, the entropy increase



Δ
S


{\displaystyle \Delta S}
, and the total amount of work that can be extracted, performed by the system,



W


{\displaystyle W}
, are well defined quantities. Conservation of energy implies




Δ

U

+
Δ
U

W

0.


{\displaystyle \Delta U_{\text{bath}}+\Delta U+W=0.}

The volume of the system is kept constant. This means that the volume of the heat bath does not change either, and we can conclude that the heat bath does not perform any work. This implies that the amount of heat that flows into the heat bath is given by





Q

=

(

.


{\displaystyle Q_{\text{bath}}=\Delta U_{\text{bath}}=-(\Delta U+W).}

The heat bath remains in thermal equilibrium at temperature T no matter what the system does. Therefore, the entropy change of the heat bath is

{\displaystyle \Delta S_{\text{bath}}={\frac {Q_{\text{bath}}}{T}}=-{\frac {\Delta U+W}{T}}.}

The total entropy change is thus given by

{\displaystyle \Delta S_{\text{bath}}+\Delta S=-{\frac {\Delta U-T\Delta S+W}{T}}.}

Since the system is in thermal equilibrium with the heat bath in the initial and the final states, T is also the temperature of the system in these states. The fact that the system's temperature does not change allows us to express the numerator as the free energy change of the system:




Δ

S

Δ

Δ

{\displaystyle \Delta S_{\text{bath}}+\Delta S=-{\frac {\Delta A+W}{T}}.}

Since the total change in entropy must always be larger or equal to zero, we obtain the inequality




W
≤
−
Δ
A
.


{\displaystyle W\leq -\Delta A.}

We see that the total amount of work that can be extracted in an isothermal process is limited by the free-energy decrease, and that increasing the free energy in a reversible process requires work to be done on the system. If no work is extracted from the system, then




Δ
A
≤
0
,


{\displaystyle \Delta A\leq 0,}

and thus for a system kept at constant temperature and volume and not capable of performing electrical or other non-PV work, the total free energy during a spontaneous change can only decrease.
This result seems to contradict the equation dA = −S dT − P dV, as keeping T and V constant seems to imply dA = 0, and hence A = constant. In reality there is no contradiction: In a simple one-component system, to which the validity of the equation dA = −S dT − P dV is restricted, no process can occur at constant T and V, since there is a unique P(T, V) relation, and thus T, V, and P are all fixed. To allow for spontaneous processes at constant T and V, one needs to enlarge the thermodynamical state space of the system. In case of a chemical reaction, one must allow for changes in the numbers Nj of particles of each type j. The differential of the free energy then generalizes to

{\displaystyle dA=-S\,dT-p\,dV+\sum _{j}\mu _{j}\,dN_{j},}

where the




N

{\displaystyle N_{j}}
are the numbers of particles of type j, and the




μ

j




{\displaystyle \mu _{j}}
are the corresponding chemical potentials. This equation is then again valid for both reversible and non-reversible uPT changes. In case of a spontaneous change at constant T and V without electrical work, the last term will thus be negative.
In case there are other external parameters, the above relation further generalizes to
