One should recognize that, in the absence of an inﬁnite current, the voltage across a capacitor
cannot change instantaneously: i.e., vC (0
). In the absence of an inﬁnite voltage,
the current in a inductor cannot change instantaneously: i.e., iL(0
). Note that an
instantaneous change in inductor current or capacitor voltage must be accompanied by a change
of stored energy in zero time, requiring an inﬁnite power source. Also observe that the voltages
across a resistor, vR(0
), are in general not equal to each other, unless the equality
−
condition is forced by iL(0
). The voltage across a resistor can change instantaneously
in its value.
