Justiﬁcation
Reprogrammable  automated  devices  such  as  robots  provide  the  ﬂexible  automation  capability  for  modern
production  systems.  To  evaluate  a  potential  robotic  application  within  a  manufacturing  environment,  both
technical and economic issues must be addressed. Typical technical issues include the choice of the number of
degrees of freedom to perform a task, the level of controller and programming complexity, end effector and
sensor choices, and degree of integration within the overall production system. Economic issues have typically
been addressed from a traditional point of view, but it is important to note that other criteria should also be
evaluated before a ﬁnal decision is made to implement a robotic system. Such criteria may be both quantitative
and qualitative.
