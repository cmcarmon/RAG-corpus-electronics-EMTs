VIH. Assume that the on-state resistance of each of the MOSFETs is RON and that the
MOSFET threshold voltage is VT. Assume that the given values satisfy the constraints
VS â‰¥ VOH and VIL < VT. For what values of n and m does this gate operate under the
static discipline? What is the worst case power consumed by this circuit?
p r o b l e m 6.6 Consider a family of logic gates that operate under the static dis-
cipline with the following voltage thresholds: VOL = 0.5 V, VIL = 1 V, VOH = 4.5 V,
and VIH = 4.0 V.
