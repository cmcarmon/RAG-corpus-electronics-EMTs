Let g be a polynomial loop algebra (background),






g


=
C
[
λ
,

λ

−

]
⊗



g



0


,


{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}=C[\lambda ,\lambda ^{-1}]\otimes {\mathfrak {g}}_{0},}

where g0 is a complex finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra. The goal is to find a central extension of this algebra. Two of the theorems apply. On the one hand, if there is a 2-cocycle on g, then a central extension may be defined. On the other hand, if this 2-cocycle is acting on the g0 part (only), then the resulting extension is trivial. Moreover, derivations acting on g0 (only) cannot be used for definition of a 2-cocycle either because these derivations are all inner and the same problem results. One therefore looks for derivations on C[λ, λ−1]. One such set of derivations is

{\displaystyle d_{k}\equiv \lambda ^{k+1}{\frac {d}{dk}},\quad k\in \mathbb {Z} .}

In order to manufacture a non-degenerate bilinear associative antisymmetric form L on g, attention is focused first on restrictions on the arguments, with m, n fixed. It is a theorem that every form satisfying the requirements is a multiple of the Killing form K on g0. This requires




L
(

λ

⊗

,

λ

⊗

G

)
=

γ

l
m


K
(

G

1


,

G

2


)
.


{\displaystyle L(\lambda ^{l}\otimes G_{1},\lambda ^{m}\otimes G_{2})=\gamma _{lm}K(G_{1},G_{2}).}

Symmetry of K implies





γ

n


=

γ

,


{\displaystyle \gamma _{mn}=\gamma _{nm},}

and associativity yields





γ

k
+
l
,
m


=

γ

k
,
l
+
m


.


{\displaystyle \gamma _{k+l,m}=\gamma _{k,l+m}.}

With l = 0 one sees that γlm = γ0,l+m. This last condition implies the former. Using this fact, define f(n) = γ0,n. The defining equation then becomes




L

,

G

)
.


{\displaystyle L(\lambda ^{m}\otimes G_{1},\lambda ^{m}\otimes G_{2})=f(l+m)K(G_{1},G_{2}).}

For every i ∈ ℤ the definition




f

)
=

⇔

{\displaystyle f(n)=\delta _{ni}\Leftrightarrow \gamma _{lm}=\delta _{l+m,i}}

does define a symmetric associative bilinear form

.


{\displaystyle L_{i}(\lambda ^{l}\otimes G_{1},\lambda ^{m}\otimes G_{2})=\delta _{l+m,i}K(G_{1},G_{2}).}

But these forms the basis of a vector space in which every form has the right properties.
Returning to the derivations at hand and the condition

)
,


{\displaystyle L_{i}(d_{k}(\lambda ^{l}\otimes G_{1}),\lambda ^{m}\otimes G_{2})=-L_{i}(\lambda ^{l}\otimes G_{1},d_{k}(\lambda ^{m}\otimes G_{2})),}

one sees, using the definitions, that

δ

or, with n = l + m,




n

δ

k

n

{\displaystyle n\delta _{k+n,i}=0.}

This (and the antisymmetry condition) holds if k = i, in particular it holds when k = i = 0.
Thus chose L = L0 and d = d0. With these choices, the premises in the corollary are satisfied. The 2-cocycle φ defined by

{\displaystyle \varphi (P(\lambda )\otimes G_{1}),Q(\lambda )\otimes G_{2}))=L(\lambda {\frac {dP}{d\lambda }}\otimes G_{1},Q(\lambda )\otimes G_{2})}

is finally employed to define a central extension of g,

This is a universal central extension of the polynomial loop algebra.
A note on terminology In physics terminology, the algebra of above might pass for a Kac–Moody algebra, whilst it will probably not in mathematics terminology. An additional dimension, an extension by a derivation is required for this. Nonetheless, if, in a physical application, the eigenvalues of g0 or its representative are interpreted as (ordinary) quantum numbers, the additional superscript on the generators is referred to as the level. It is an additional quantum number. An additional operator whose eigenvalues are precisely the levels is introduced further below.
