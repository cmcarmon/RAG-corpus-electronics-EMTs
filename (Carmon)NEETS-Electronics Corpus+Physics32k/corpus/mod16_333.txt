SWITCHING SHUNT VALUES.â€”Various values of shunt resistance can be used, by means of a
suitable switching arrangement, to increase the number of current ranges that can be covered by the
meter. Two switching arrangements are shown in figure 3-5. View A is the simpler of the two
arrangements when a number of shunts are used to calculate the values of the shunt resistors. However, it
has two disadvantages:
