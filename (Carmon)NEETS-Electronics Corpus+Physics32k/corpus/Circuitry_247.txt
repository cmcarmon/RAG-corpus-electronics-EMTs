Light  emitting  diodes  are  available  in  various 
formats  with  the  round  types  being  most  popular. 
Round LEDs are commonly available in the 3 mm 
and 5 mm (0.2 inch) diameter plastic packages and 
also  in  a  5  mm  x  2  mm  rectangular  format.  The 
viewing  angle  for  round  LEDs  tends  to  be  in  the 
region of 20° to 40°, whereas for rectangular types 
this 
to  around  100°.  Table  5.6 
summarizes  the  characteristics  of  several  common 
types of LED. 
In order to limit the forward current of an LED 
 
to  an  appropriate  value,  it  is  usually  necessary  to 
include  a  fixed  resistor  in  series  with  an  LED 
indicator,  as  shown  in  Fig.  5.16. The  value  of  the 
resistor may be calculated from:
