In addition to the shaft and optomechanical mice, an early form of mouse used multiturn potentiometers
connected to the wheels, and the output voltage that represented the motion varied in direct proportion to the
mouse motion. The voltage was then converted by means of an analog-to-digital converter into digital form
for input to the computer.
