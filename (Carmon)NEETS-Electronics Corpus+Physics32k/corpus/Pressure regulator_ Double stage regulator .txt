Two stage regulators are two single stage regulators in one that operate to reduce the pressure progressively in two stages instead of one. The first stage, which is preset, reduces the pressure of the supply gas to an intermediate stage; gas at that pressure passes into the second stage. The gas now emerges at a pressure (working pressure) set by the pressure adjusting control knob attached to the diaphragm. Two stage regulators have two safety valves, so that if there is any excess pressure there will be no explosion. A major objection to the single stage regulator is the need for frequent torque adjustment. If the supply pressure falls, the outlet pressure increases, necessitating torque adjustment. In the two stage regulator, there is automatic compensation for any drop in the supply pressure. Single stage regulators may be used with pipe lines and cylinders. Two stage regulators are used with cylinders and manifolds.
