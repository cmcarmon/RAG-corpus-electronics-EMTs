 Q26. You have removed an open fuse from a fuseholder and repaired the cause of the fuse opening. The
parts list specifies a fuse coded F02BI25VÃ±A. There are no fuses available with that identification.
In the following list, indicate if the fuse is a direct replacement, a good substitute, or not
acceptable. For the fuses that are good substitutes, number them in order of preference and explain
why they are numbered that way. If the fuse is not acceptable, explain why.
