In addition to its use as an important tool in the study of the nature of electrically conducting materials,
the  Hall  effect  has  a  number  of  direct  practical  applications.  For  example,  the  sensor  in  some  commercial
devices for measuring the magnitude and orientation of magnetic ﬁelds is a Hall sensor. The spontaneous Hall
effect has been used as a nondestructive method for exploring the presence of defects in steel structures. The
quantum Hall effect has been used to reﬁne our knowledge of the magnitudes of certain fundamental constants
such as the ratio of
