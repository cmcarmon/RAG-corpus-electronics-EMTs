Equation (1) will be the starting point in this derivation. Equation (CD) is used to define the force, and equation (RelativeSpeed) is used for the relative speed. These substitutions give the following formula for power.

The formulas (CP) and (SpeedRatio) are applied to express (DragPower) in nondimensional form:

It can be shown through calculus that equation (DragCP) achieves a maximum at



λ
=
1

/

3


{\displaystyle \lambda =1/3}
. By inspection one can see that equation (DragPower) will achieve larger values for



λ
>
1


{\displaystyle \lambda >1}
. In these circumstances, the scalar product in equation (1) makes the result negative. Thus, one can conclude that the maximum power is given by:

D




{\displaystyle C_{P}={\frac {4}{27}}C_{D}}

Experimentally it has been determined that a large

D




{\displaystyle C_{D}}
is 1.2, thus the maximum




C

P




{\displaystyle C_{P}}
is approximately 0.1778.
