The Two-Rays Ground Reflected Model is a radio propagation model which predicts the path losses between a transmitting antenna and a receiving antenna. Generally, the two antenna each have different height. The received signal having two components, the LOS (line of sight) component and the multipath component formed predominantly by a single ground reflected wave.
