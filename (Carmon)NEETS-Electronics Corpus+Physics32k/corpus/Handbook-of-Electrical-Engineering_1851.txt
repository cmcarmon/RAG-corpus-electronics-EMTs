of a “pie-slice” or “fan” velocity ﬁlter [Bose, 1985] rejects totally wavenumbers outside the range –*w*/V £ k1 £
*w*/V and passes completely wavenumbers defined within that range. Thus, the transfer function defines a high-
pass ﬁlter which passes signals with apparent velocities of magnitude greater than V at a ﬁxed frequency w. If
the equispaced sensors are D units apart, the spatial sampling results in a periodic wavenumber response with
period k1 = 1/(2D). Therefore, for a speciﬁed apparent velocity V, the resolvable wavenumber and frequency
bands are, respectively, –1/(2D) £ k1 £ 1/(2D) and –V/(2D) £ w £ V/(2D) where w/(2D) represents the folding
frequency in radians/second.
