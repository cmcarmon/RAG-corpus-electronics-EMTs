Solution:
We  ﬁrst  need  to  replace  the  circuit  by  its  Thevenin  equivalent  at
terminals  a and  b. The  Thevenin  resistance  is  found  using  the  circuit
3-k⍀
in Fig. 4.65(a). Notice that the 
resistors are in parallel;
resistors.  The  two  parallel  combinations
so  are  the 
form a series combination with respect to terminals a and b. Hence,
