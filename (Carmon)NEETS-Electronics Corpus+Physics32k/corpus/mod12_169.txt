Radio stations in the standard broadcast band are assigned carrier frequencies by the Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC). When two stations are located near each other, their carriers must 
be spaced some minimum distance apart in the radio spectrum. Otherwise, the sideband frequencies of 
one station will interfere with sideband frequencies of the other station. The standard AM broadcast band 
starts at 535 kilohertz and ends at 1,605 kilohertz. Carrier assignments start at 540 kilohertz and continue 
in a succession of 10-kilohertz increments until the upper limit of the broadcast band is reached. This adds 
up to a total of 107 carrier assignments, or CHANNELS, over the entire broadcast band. If stations were 
assigned to all 107 channels (in a given geographical area), each station would be allotted a channel width 
of 10 kilohertz. This leaves 5 kilohertz on each side of each carrier for sidebands. Since interference 
between such closely spaced stations would be nearly impossible to prevent, the FCC avoids assigning 
adjacent channels to stations in the same area. As a consequence of this policy, one or more vacant 
channels normally exist between stations in the broadcast band. In the interest of better fidelity, the 
stations are permitted to use modulating frequencies higher than 5 kilohertz as long as no interference 
with other stations is produced.
