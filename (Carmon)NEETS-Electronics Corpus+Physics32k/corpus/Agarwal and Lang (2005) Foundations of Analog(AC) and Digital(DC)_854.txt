MOSFETs are constructed through several fabrication steps on the surface
of a planar piece of single-crystal silicon called a wafer. Figure 6.32 shows the
top view of several rectangular MOSFETs fabricated on a planar silicon surface.
A wafer can be tens of centimeters in diameter, and typical MOSFETs might
−6
occupy an area that is less than a square micrometer. One micrometer is 10
meters. A micrometer (µm) is also referred to as a micron (µ). The fabrica-
tion steps result in the construction of several planar layers sandwiched on the
wafer surface. The layers might constitute insulating layers made up of sili-
con dioxide (SiO2) created by oxidizing parts of the wafer surface, conducting
layers comprising deposits of metals such as aluminum or copper, or poly-
crystalline silicon (poly), and semiconducting layers comprising silicon doped
with materials with a high concentration of free electrons or holes. (A hole is
