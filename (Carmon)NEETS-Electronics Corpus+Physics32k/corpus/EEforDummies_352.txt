Ohm’s Law also comes in handy when you’re analyzing all kinds of circuits, 
whether simple or complex. You’ll use it in designing and altering electronic 
circuits, to make sure you get the right current and voltage to the right 
places in your circuit. You’ll use Ohm’s Law so much, it will become second 
nature to you.
