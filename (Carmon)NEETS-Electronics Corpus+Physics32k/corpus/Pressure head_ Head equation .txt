Pressure head is a component of hydraulic head, in which it is combined with elevation head. When considering dynamic (flowing) systems, there is a third term needed: velocity head. Thus, the three terms of velocity head, elevation head, and pressure head appear in the head equation derived from the Bernoulli equation for incompressible fluids:

z

C



{\displaystyle h_{v}+z_{\text{elevation}}+\psi =C\,}

where





h

v




{\displaystyle h_{v}}
is velocity head,





z

elevation




{\displaystyle z_{\text{elevation}}}
is elevation head,




ψ


{\displaystyle \psi }
is pressure head, and




C


{\displaystyle C}
is a constant for the system
