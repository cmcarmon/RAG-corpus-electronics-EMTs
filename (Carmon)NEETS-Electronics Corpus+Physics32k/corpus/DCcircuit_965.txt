The choice of each current’s direction is entirely arbitrary, just as in the Branch Current
method, but the resulting equations are easier to solve if the currents are going the same
direction through intersecting components (note how currents I1 and I2 are both going “up”
through resistor R2, where they “mesh,” or intersect). If the assumed direction of a mesh
current is wrong, the answer for that current will have a negative value.
