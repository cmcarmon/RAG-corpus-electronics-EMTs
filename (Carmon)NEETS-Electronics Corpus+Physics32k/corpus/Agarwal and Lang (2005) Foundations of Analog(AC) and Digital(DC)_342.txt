Another way to emphasize that 5 and 6 are not true nodes is to redraw
the circuit as shown in Figure 2.49. Clearly the circuit topology is unchanged in
the sense that the interconnections among resistors and source are the same as
before, but the false nodes have disappeared. We conclude that a node should
be defined as a junction where two or more circuit elements, other than perfect
conductors, join together. Whenever a number of circuit elements connect to
one perfect conductor, (for example, 5, 4, 6 in Figure 2.46) only one node is
created.
