Critical phenomena may also appear for dynamic quantities, not only for static ones. In fact, the divergence of the characteristic time



τ


{\displaystyle \tau }
of a system is directly related to the divergence of the thermal correlation length



ξ


{\displaystyle \xi }
by the introduction of a dynamical exponent z and the relation



τ
=

ξ


z




{\displaystyle \tau =\xi ^{\,z}}
. The voluminous static universality class of a system splits into different, less voluminous dynamic universality classes with different values of z but a common static critical behaviour, and by approaching the critical point one may observe all kinds of slowing-down phenomena.
