To ensure efficient performance, some technicians make a policy of replacing the tr tube after a 
certain number of hours of use. A better practice is to measure the tr recovery time at frequent intervals 
and make a graph or chart. A graph or chart will immediately disclose any change in performance. Figure 
4-10 shows how the recovery time is correlated with leakage power. Note that the end of the useful life of 
the tr tube is indicated by an increase in recovery time.
