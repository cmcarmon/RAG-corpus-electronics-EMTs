Negative feedback is accomplished by adding part of the output signal out of phase with the input 
signal. You have seen that an emitter resistor in a common-emitter transistor amplifier will develop a 
negative feedback signal. Other methods of providing negative feedback are similar to those methods 
used to provide positive feedback. The phase relationship of the feedback signal and the input signal is the 
only difference.
