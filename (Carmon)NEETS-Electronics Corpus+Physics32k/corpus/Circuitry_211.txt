This value can be made from preferred values using 
a 2.2 µF capacitor connected in series with a 5.6 µF 
capacitor. 
 
Example 4.14 
 
A series  L–C–R  circuit  comprises  an  inductor  of  
20  mH,  a  capacitor  of  10  nF,  and  a  resistor  of  
100  F. If  the  circuit  is  supplied  with  a  sinusoidal 
signal of 1.5 V at a frequency of 2 kHz, determine 
the  current  supplied  and  the  voltage  developed 
across the resistor.
