Several units are used to express failure rates. In addition to l(t) which is usually in number per hour, %/K is
used to denote failure rate in percent per thousand hours and PPM/K is used to express failure rate in parts
per million per thousand hours. The last unit is also known as FIT for “fails in time”. The relationships between
these units are given in Table 110.2.
