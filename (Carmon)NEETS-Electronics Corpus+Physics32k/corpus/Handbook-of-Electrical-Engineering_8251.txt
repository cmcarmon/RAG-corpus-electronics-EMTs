Figure 84.5 shows the simpliﬁed circuit diagram of a monolithic sampling-and-hold circuit and the associated
switching waveforms. The differential ampliﬁers function as input and output buffers, and the capacitor acts
 position, the two buffers are connected
as the storage mechanism. When the mode control switch is at its 
in series and the capacitor follows the input with minimum time delay, if it is small. Now, if the mode control
 the feedback loop is interrupted, and the capacitor ideally retains its terminal voltage until the

next sampling signal occurs. Leakage and bias currents usually cause the capacitor to discharge and or charge
 which could be minimized by having a
in the hold mode and the ﬂuctuation of the hold voltage is called
