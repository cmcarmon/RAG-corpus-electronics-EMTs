The leakage current may influence the current gain or amplification factor of the transistor.
Therefore, a particular transistor might operate properly in one circuit and not in another. This
characteristic is more critical in certain applications than in others. As the transistor ages, the amount of
leakage current tends to increase. One type of transistor checker used is the semiconductor test set. This
test set can be used either for in-circuit or out-of-circuit tests or for collector leakage current or current
gain. You should use extreme care when substituting transistors. More and more transistors have specific
current and breakdown voltage requirements that may affect how they operate within a given circuit.
