A tuned radio frequency (TRF) receiver 
 
Tuned  radio  frequency  (TRF)  receivers  provide  a 
means  of  receiving  local  signals  using  fairly 
minimal  circuitry.  The  simplified  block  schematic 
of a TRF receiver is shown in Fig. 13.10. 
 The  signal  from  the  aerial  is  applied  to  an  RF 
amplifier  stage.  This  stage  provides  a  moderate 
amount  of  gain  at  the  signal  frequency.  It  also 
provides  selectivity  by  incorporating  one  or  more 
tuned  circuits  at  the  signal  frequency.  This  helps 
the receiver to reject signals that may be present on 
adjacent channels. 
 The output of the RF amplifier stage is applied to 
the  demodulator.  This  stage  recovers  the  audio 
frequency  signal  from  the  modulated  RF  signal. 
The  demodulator  stage  may  also  incorporate  a 
tuned  circuit  to  further  improve  the  selectivity  of 
the receiver. 
 The output of the demodulator stage is fed to the 
input  of 
the  AF  amplifier  stage.  This  stage 
increases  the  level  of  the  audio  signal  from  the 
demodulator  so  that  it  is  sufficient  to  drive  a 
loudspeaker. 
 TRF receivers have a number of limitations with 
regard to sensitivity and selectivity and this makes 
them  generally  unsuitable  for  use  in  commercial 
radio equipment.
