Analytical  manipulation  of  a  source  integral  that  incorporates  the  selected  Green’s  function  as  part  of  its
kernel  function  then  follows,  with  the  speciﬁc  details  depending  on  the  particular  formulation  being  used.
Perhaps  the  simplest  is  that  of  boundary-condition  matching  wherein  the  behavior  required  of  the  electric
and/or magnetic ﬁelds at speciﬁed surfaces that deﬁne the problem geometry is explicitly imposed. Alternative
formulations, for example, the Rayleigh–Ritz variational method and Rumsey’s reaction concept, might be used
instead, but as pointed out by Harrington [in Miller et al., 1991], from the viewpoint of a numerical imple-
mentation any of these approaches lead to formally equivalent models.
