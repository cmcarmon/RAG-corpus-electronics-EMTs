This chapter looks at what capacitors are made of, how 
they store electrical energy, and how circuits use that 
energy. You get to watch a capacitor charge, store energy, and 
later release its energy. Then you find out how capacitors work closely with 
resistors to perform useful functions. Finally, I showcase the various uses of 
capacitors in electronic circuits â€” proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that 
capacitors are worth getting charged up about.
