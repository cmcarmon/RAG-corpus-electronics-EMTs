Contrast the amplifier behavior for the input signal source with a suitable
DC offset voltage shown in Figure 7.25 with that for the input signal source
applied directly Figure 7.27. When the input signal is applied to the amplifier
without a DC offset, the MOSFET operates in its cutoff region for most of
the input signal, and the output is highly distorted, bearing little resemblance
to the input. The form of distortion suffered by the signal in the example in
Figure 7.27 is called clipping.
