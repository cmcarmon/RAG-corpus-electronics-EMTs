There are different theories in different formulations, which each have been popularly called the toothpaste tube theory. These theories usually are based on the observation that when one squeezes one end of the toothpaste tube, toothpaste is inevitably extruded from the other end. This is intended as an analogy to the fact that pressure built up in some finite bounded system needs to be released somewhere or the system will break. Although, prima facie, the theory is an explanation about the movement of physical objects, it has also been used to explain social and political behavior, as well as relationships involving abstract concepts.
