The following differences exist between a dc resistive circuit and a magnetic circuit
• Reluctance ᑬ is not an energy-loss component like a resistance R (which leads to an
I 2R loss). Energy must be supplied continuously when a direct current is established and
maintained in an electric circuit; but a similar situation does not prevail in the case of a
magnetic circuit, in which a ﬂux is established and maintained constant.
• Magnetic ﬂuxes take leakage paths [as φl in Figure 11.2.1(b)]; but electric currents ﬂowing
through resistive networks do not.
