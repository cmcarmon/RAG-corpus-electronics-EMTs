Water-Steam System.
Large pumps drive the feedwater through the high-pressure heaters and the economizer,

F). The former is heated by steam removed from the

turbine; the latter is heated by the ﬂue gases. The preheated water is fed to the steam drum. Insulated tubes,
called downcomers, are located outside the furnace and lead the water to a header. The header distributes the
hot water among the risers. These are water tubes that line the furnace walls. The water tubes are heated by
the combustion gases through both convection and radiation. The steam generated in these tubes ﬂows to the
drum,  where  it  is  separated  from  the  water.  Circulation  is  maintained  by  the  density  difference  between  the
water  in  the  downcomer  and  the  water  tubes.  Saturated  steam,  collected  in  the  drum,  ﬂows  through  the

the  high-pressure  turbine.  The  exhaust  from  the  high-pressure  turbine  goes  to  the  reheater,  which  again
increases the steam temperature. The reheated steam drives the low-pressure turbine.
