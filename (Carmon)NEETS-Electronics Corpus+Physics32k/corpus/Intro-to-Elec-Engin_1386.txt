Frequencies above 30 MHz, propagating through the ionosphere with relatively little loss,
make satellite and extraterrestrial communications possible. In the VHF band and higher, the
dominant mode is line-of-sight (LOS) propagation, in which the transmitter and receiver antennas
must be in direct LOS with relatively little or no obstruction. That is why television stations
