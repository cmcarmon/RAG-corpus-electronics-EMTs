In the rest of this example, we will discuss the piecewise-linear model for the BJT pre-
sented in Figure 7.49c and compare its predictions with the measured characteristics
(iC versus vCE for various values of iB) shown in Figure 7.48. We will plot the
characteristics predicted by the piecewise-linear model assuming β = 100.
To plot the characteristics, we identify BJT behavior in the two piecewise-linear regions
of operation that are of interest to us, and shown in Figure 7.50: cutoff and active.
We first observe that iC is zero when the BJT is in cutoff, that is, when iB = 0 (see
Figure 7.50a). The curve labeled ‘‘Cutoff region’’ in Figure 7.51 depicts this situation.
Next, when iB > 0 and vCE > vBE−0.4 V (or, equivalently, vCE > 0.2 V), the collector
current is a constant at β times the base current (Figure 7.50b). In the iC versus vCE plot
in Figure 7.51, these constant current curves appear as horizontal lines. Because β is a
constant, the iC versus iB relationship is linear, and so the lines are equally spaced for
equal increments in iB.
Finally, when iB > 0 and vCE = vBE − 0.4 V (or, equivalently, when vCE = 0.2 V), the
saturation region model applies (Figure 7.50c). vCE is correctly shown as being pinned at
0.2 V. The vertical line at vCE = 0.2 V corresponding to iC indicates a short-circuit-like
behavior in which the collector current is limited only by external circuit constraints.
