Let us study a MOSFET version of the difference amplifier. The amplifier employs a pair
of matching transistors called the source-coupled pair. The source-coupled amplifier is
shown in Figure 8.28. vA and vB are the inputs, and vX and vY are the outputs. Assume
vA and vB are the input voltages measured with respect to ground. Also assume that
va and vb are small variations in the inputs, and that vx and vy are the corresponding
small-signal variations in the output. The source-coupled pair is connected in series with
a DC current source with a high internal resistance Ri. (We can implement the current
source using a MOSFET biased to operate in its saturation region, but we do not show it
here. For simplicity, we use an abstract non-ideal current source instead. In other words,
the current source has a finite resistance, Ri.) Let the current provided by the DC current
source be I.
