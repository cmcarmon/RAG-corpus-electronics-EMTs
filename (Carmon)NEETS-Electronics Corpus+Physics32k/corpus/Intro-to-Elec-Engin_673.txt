Also shown in Figure 7.4.3(a) is a breakdown voltage, denoted by BVDGO, at which breakdown in
the drain–gate junction occurs in the channel near the drain. For most JFETs, BVDGO ranges from
about 20 to 50 V. The dependence of iD on vDS, as shown in Figure 7.4.3(b), can be accounted for
by applying a ﬁrst-order correction to Equation (7.4.1),
