The efficiency of an amplifier refers to the amount of power delivered to the output compared to the 
power supplied to the circuit. Since every device takes power to operate, if the amplifier operates for 360ยบ 
of input signal, it uses more power than if it only operates for 180ยบ of input signal. If the amplifier uses 
more power, less power is available for the output signal and efficiency is lower. Since class A amplifiers 
operate (have current flow) for 360ยบ of input signal, they are low in efficiency. This low efficiency is 
acceptable in class A amplifiers because they are used where efficiency is not as important as fidelity.
