Electric energy is widely used in practice, because of the ease with which the system and device
performance can be reliably controlled. One of the major areas of electrical engineering of interest
to all engineers is control and instrumentation. Instrumentation is integrated throughout the book in
sections on electric circuits, electronic analog and digital systems, energy systems, and information
systems. This Ô¨Ånal chapter serves to introduce a variety of methods by which the performance
of physical systems is controlled. By focusing on control aspects, the integration of many of the
concepts used in the preceding chapters is effected.
