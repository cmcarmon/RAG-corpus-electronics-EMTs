The stator of a synchro is a cylindrical structure of slotted laminations on which three Y-connected 
coils are wound with their axes 120ยบ apart. In figure 1-7, view A shows a typical stator assembly 
consisting of the laminated stator, stator windings, and cylindrical frame; view B shows the stator 
lamination and the slots in which the windings are placed. Some synchros are constructed so both the 
stator and the rotor may be turned. Electrical connections to this type of stator are made through slip rings 
and brushes.
