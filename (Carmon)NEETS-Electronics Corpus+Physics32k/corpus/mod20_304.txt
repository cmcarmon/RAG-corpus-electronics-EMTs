KIRCHHOFF'S LAWSÂ—(1) The algebraic sum of the current flowing toward any point in a circuit and 
the current flowing away from it is zero. (2) The algebraic sum of the products of the current and 
resistance in each of the conductors in any closed path in a network is equal to the algebraic sum of the 
electromotive forces in the path [1].
