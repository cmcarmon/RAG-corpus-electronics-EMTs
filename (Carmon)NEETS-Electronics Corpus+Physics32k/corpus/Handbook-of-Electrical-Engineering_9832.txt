As we see from this last result, there is a very direct relationship between the transfer function of a linear
constant-coefﬁcient system, the time response of a system to any known input, and the sinusoidal steady-state
response of the system. We can always determine any of these if we are given any one of them. This is a very
important result. This important conclusion justiﬁes a design procedure for linear systems that is based only
on sinusoidal steady-state response, as it is possible to determine transient responses, or responses to any given
system input, from a knowledge of steady-state sinusoidal responses, at least in theory. In practice, this might
be rather difﬁcult computationally without some form of automated assistance.
