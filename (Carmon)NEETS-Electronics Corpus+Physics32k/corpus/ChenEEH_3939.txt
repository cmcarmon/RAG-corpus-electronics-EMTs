system), it may be desirable to detect a signal of constant
amplitude, and then F1 will simply be F0 shifted by a mean
value equal to the signal amplitude. In general, this formulation
also assumes that, with probability one, either the null hypoth-
esis or the alternative is true. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, let p0 and p1 be the
prior probabilities of H0 and H1 being true, respectively. Then:
