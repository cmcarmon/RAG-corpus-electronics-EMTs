HE TRULY INCREDIBLE CHANGES in the technology associated with electronics over the past three
decades have certainly been the driving force for most of the growth in the ﬁeld of electrical engineering.
Recall that 30 years ago the transistor was a novel device and that the majority of electronic systems
still used vacuum tubes. Then look at the section headings in the following chapters and appreciate the range
of  ways  that  electronics  has  impacted  electrical  engineering.  Ampliﬁers,  integrated  circuits,  ﬁlters,  power
electronics,  and  optoelectronics  are  examples  of  how  electronics  transformed  the  practice  of  electrical  engi-
neering  in  such  diverse  ﬁelds  as  power  generation  and  distribution,  communications,  signal  processing,  and
computers.
