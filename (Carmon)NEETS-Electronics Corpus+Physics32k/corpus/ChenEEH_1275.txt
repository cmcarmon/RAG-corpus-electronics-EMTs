computers) to 1.8 in (used in laptop and portable com-
puters). The most typical size used in a PC is 3.5 in, and
the ones used in notebook computers are from 1.8 to
2.5 in. The rotating speed also varies depending on the
interface used (discussed more in the bus interface
section). For an integrated drive electronics (IDE) inter-
face, the speed varies from 4500 rpm to 7200 rpm. For a
small computer systems interface (SCSI), the speed can be
as high as 10,800 rpm. The typical capacity varies from
one gigabyte to tens of gigabytes (1 GB is 230 bytes).
