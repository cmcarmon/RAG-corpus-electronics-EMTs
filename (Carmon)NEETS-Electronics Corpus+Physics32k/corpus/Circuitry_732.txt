Practical investigation  
 
Objective 
 
To  investigate  faults  in  a  typical  linear  regulated 
power supply. 
 
Components and test equipment 
Breadboard,  mains  transformer  with  220  V  (or  
110  V  where  appropriate)  primary  and  15  V  2  A 
secondary  winding,  four  1N5401  diodes,  TIP41C 
transistor  mounted  on  a  heatsink  of  less  than  
2.5  °C/W,  TL081  operational  amplifier,  fixed 
resistors  of  1  kH (two  required)  and  2.2  kH (two 
required), 500 mA quick-blow fuse, 2 A slow-blow 
fuse,  BZX79  7.5  V  zener  diode,  capacitors  of  
6,800 µF, 470 µF, and 100 µF (all rated at 50 V d.c. 
working), digital multimeter, test leads and probes.
