The dc motor is a mechanical workhorse, that can be used in many different ways. Many large pieces 
of equipment depend on a dc motor for their power to move. The speed and direction of rotation of a dc 
motor are easily controlled. This makes it especially useful for operating equipment, such as winches, 
cranes, and missile launchers, which must move in different directions and at varying speeds.
