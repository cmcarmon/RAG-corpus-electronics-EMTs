⁡
ν





{\displaystyle r={{h^{2}} \over {\mu }}{{1} \over {1+\cos \nu }}}

where:




r



{\displaystyle r\,}
is radial distance of orbiting body from central body,




h



{\displaystyle h\,}
is specific angular momentum of the orbiting body,




ν



{\displaystyle \nu \,}
is a true anomaly of the orbiting body,




μ



{\displaystyle \mu \,}
is the standard gravitational parameter.
