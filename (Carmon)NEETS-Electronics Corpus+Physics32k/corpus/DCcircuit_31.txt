It was discovered much later that this ”ﬂuid” was actually composed of extremely small bits
of matter called electrons, so named in honor of the ancient Greek word for amber: another
material exhibiting charged properties when rubbed with cloth. Experimentation has since
revealed that all objects are composed of extremely small ”building-blocks” known as atoms,
and that these atoms are in turn composed of smaller components known as particles. The
three fundamental particles comprising most atoms are called protons, neutrons and electrons.
Whilst the majority of atoms have a combination of protons, neutrons, and electrons, not all
atoms have neutrons; an example is the protium isotope (1H1) of hydrogen (Hydrogen-1) which
is the lightest and most common form of hydrogen which only has one proton and one electron.
Atoms are far too small to be seen, but if we could look at one, it might appear something like
this:
