• A circuit breaker is a specially designed switch that automatically opens to interrupt
circuit current in the event of an overcurrent condition. They can be ”tripped” (opened)
thermally, by magnetic ﬁelds, or by external devices called ”protective relays,” depending
on the design of breaker, its size, and the application.
