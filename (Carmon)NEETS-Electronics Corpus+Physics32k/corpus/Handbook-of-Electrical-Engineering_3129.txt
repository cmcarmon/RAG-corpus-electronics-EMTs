Insulated-Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT)
The IGBT has the high input impedance and high-speed characteristics of a MOSFET with the conductivity
characteristic  (low  saturation  voltage)  of  a  bipolar  transistor.  The  IGBT  is  turned  on  by  applying  a  positive
voltage between the gate and emitter and, as in the MOSFET, it is turned off by making the gate signal zero or
slightly negative. The IGBT has a much lower voltage drop than a MOSFET of similar ratings. The structure
of an IGBT is more like a thyristor and MOSFET. For a given IGBT, there is a critical value of collector current
