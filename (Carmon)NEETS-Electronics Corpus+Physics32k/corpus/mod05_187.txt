Compensating windings and interpoles are as important in motors as they are in generators. 
Compensating windings are relatively expensive; therefore, most large dc motors depend on interpoles to 
correct armature reaction. Compensating windings are the same in motors as they are in generators. 
Interpoles, however, are slightly different. The difference is that in a generator the interpole has the same 
polarity as the main pole AHEAD of it in the direction of rotation. In a motor the interpole has the same 
polarity as the main pole FOLLOWING it.
