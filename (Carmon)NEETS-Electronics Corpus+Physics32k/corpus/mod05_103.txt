This type of field rheostat contains tapped resistors with leads to a multiterminal switch. The arm of 
the switch may be rotated to make contact with the various resistor taps. This varies the amount of 
resistance in the field circuit. Rotating the arm in the direction of the LOWER arrow (counterclockwise) 
increases the resistance and lowers the output voltage. Rotating the arm in the direction of the RAISE 
arrow (clockwise) decreases the resistance and increases the output voltage.
