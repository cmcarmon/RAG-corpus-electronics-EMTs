Resistance	is	the	measurement	of	an	opposing	electric	current;	it	can	be	expressed
in	ohms.	It	generates	an	amount	of	friction	that	is	relative	to	the	necessary	amount
of	electricity	that	a	particular	circuit	can	handle.
In	a	way,	resistance	is	responsible	for	the	smooth	flow	of	electricity	in	a	circuit.
Although	others	would	counter	the	argument	by	saying	that	rather	than	support	the
effortless	flow	of	electricity	in	a	system,	it	slows	it	down.
However,	it	is	resistance	that	allows	balance	of	electricity	in	a	circuit.	Take	for
example	the	case	of	a	circuit	that	can	only	handle	a	total	of	15V.	If	a	circuit	takes
in	20V	at	a	resistance	of	5	ohms,	the	number	is	diminished	to	15V,	which	indicates
a	functional	circuit.	Conversely,	if,	in	the	same	situation,	there	is	no	resistance	of	5
ohms,	a	circuit	may	not	be	as	functional	as	desired;	its	system	ends	up	carrying
20V,	which	implies	that	it	is	overloaded.
