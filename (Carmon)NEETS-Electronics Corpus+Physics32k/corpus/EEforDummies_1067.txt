You can use a third hand clamp (as described in Chapter 13) or a vise 
and an alligator clip to hold a discrete component steady as you solder 
a wire to it, or use needle‐nose pliers to hold a component in place over 
a circuit board. For leaded components, such as a resistor, bending the 
leads slightly will help hold the component in place.
