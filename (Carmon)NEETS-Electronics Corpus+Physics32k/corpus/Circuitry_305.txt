secondary  winding  resistance  together  with  the 
forward  resistance  of  the  diode  and  the  (minimal) 
resistance of the wiring and connections. Hence C1
charges  very  rapidly  as  soon  as  either  D1  or  D2 
starts  to  conduct.  The  time  required  for  C1 to 
discharge  is,  in  contrast,  very  much  greater.  The 
discharge  time  contrast  is  determined  by  the 
capacitance  value  and  the  load  resistance,  RL. In 
practice, RL is very much larger than the resistance 
of  the  secondary  circuit  and  hence  C1 takes  an 
appreciable time to discharge. During this time, D1 
and  D2  will  be  reverse  biased  and  held  in  a  non-
conducting  state.  As  a  consequence,  the  only 
discharge  path  for  C1 is  through  RL. Figure  6.13 
shows voltage waveforms for the bi-phase rectifier, 
with  and  without  C1 present.  Note  that  the  ripple 
frequency  (100  Hz)  is  twice  that  of  the  half-wave 
circuit shown previously in Fig. 6.7.
