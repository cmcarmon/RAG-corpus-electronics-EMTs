In equations 4.1 and 4.2, E and H are the electric and magnetic
ﬁeld intensities. CV and CI are arbitrary integration contours,
parallel to electric and magnetic ﬂux lines, respectively, as
displayed in Figure 4.3 for a coaxial
line. The TEM ﬁeld
distribution can be entirely calculated by considering static
electric and magnetic ﬁelds, namely, an irrotational (or curl-
free) electric ﬁeld and the absence of displacement currents.
Hence, the voltages and currents deﬁned in equations 4.1
and 4.2 are independent of the integration contour’s orienta-
tion.
