To understand what this circuit accomplishes, we want to determine the voltage across the resistor labeled
by its value R2. Recasting this problem mathematically, we need to solve some set of equations so that we
relate the output voltage vout to the source voltage. It would be simple—a little too simple at this point—if
we could instantly write down the one equation that relates these two voltages. Until we have more knowledge
about how circuits work, we must write a set of equations that allow us to ﬁnd all the voltages and currents
that can be deﬁned for every circuit element. Because we have a three-element circuit, we have a total of six
voltages and currents that must be either speciﬁed or determined. You can deﬁne the directions for current
ﬂow and positive voltage drop any way you like. When two people solve a circuit their own ways, the
signs of their variables may not agree, but current ﬂow and voltage drop values for each element will agree.
Do recall in deﬁning your voltage and current variables that the v-i relations for the elements presume that
