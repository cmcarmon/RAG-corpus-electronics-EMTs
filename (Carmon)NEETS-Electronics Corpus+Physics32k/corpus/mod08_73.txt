Notice that the output signal is distorted. The output signal no longer has the same shape as the input 
signal. The portion of the output signal that appears to be cut off is caused by the lack of current through 
the transistor. When the emitter becomes positive enough, the transistor cannot conduct because the base-
to-emitter junction is no longer forward biased. Any further increase in input signal will not cause an 
increase in output signal voltage.
