Light propagates in multimode graded-index fibers according to refraction and total internal
reflection. The gradual decrease in the core's refractive index from the center of the fiber causes the light
rays to be refracted many times. The light rays become refracted or curved, which increases the angle of
incidence at the next point of refraction. Total internal reflection occurs when the angle of incidence
becomes larger than the critical angle of incidence. Figure 3-5 shows the process of refraction and total
internal reflection of light in multimode graded-index fibers. Figure 3-5 also illustrates the boundaries of
