The LED is symbolized by a triangle with a line segment on one end and 
two arrows pointing outward. The triangular part of the symbol represents 
a diode, and the two arrows facing out represent the fact that this diode 
emits light (hence, it is a light‐emitting diode). Diodes are part of a special 
class of electronic component known as semiconductors, which I describe in 
Chapter 9.
