From this basic idea, methods have been developed that
differ from each other in the augmentation of a node, by the
representation of the reference information, and by the deri-
vation of the run-time information. Figure 8.12 shows a pos-
sible augmentation of a basic block of a program for the
purpose of CFC. Each ‘‘signature instruction’’ can be one
or two NOPS containing the signature in the non-opcode
ﬁelds.
