Let us now consider the addition of a load bus to the operating power system. Service
classiﬁcations assigned by the electric utilities include residential, commercial, light industrial,
and heavy industrial loads, as well as municipal electric company loads. Let us prepare a load-
bus speciﬁcation, which is a summary of the service requirements that must be provided by the
electric utility. Referring to the simple model of Figure 10.3.5, as an example, let the total new
load connected to the system be 220 MVA at 0.8 power factor lagging; let the service be provided
at the subtransmission level from a radial 115-kV circuit; let the 115-kV transmission line have
a per-phase series impedance of 3 + j8 .
