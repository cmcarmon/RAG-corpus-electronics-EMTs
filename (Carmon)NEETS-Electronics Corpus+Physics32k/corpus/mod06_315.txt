In view B, the control grid is at zero potential (0 volts). Just as in the sharp-cutoff tube, electrons
leave the cathode and travel along the lines of electrostatic attraction, through the spaces between the grid
wires to the plate. In view C, a bias voltage of -6 volts is applied to the grid. Because of the close spacing
of the grid wires at the ends of the grid, electrostatic lines of force at the ends are effectively terminated.
The lines of force can only pass between the widely spaced grid wires closer to the center of the grid.
