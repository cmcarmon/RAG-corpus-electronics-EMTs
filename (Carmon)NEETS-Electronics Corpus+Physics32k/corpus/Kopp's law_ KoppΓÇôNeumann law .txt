The Kopp–Neumann law, named for Kopp and Franz Ernst Neumann, states that the specific heat C per unit mass (in J·kg−1·K−1) for alloys can be calculated from the following equation:




C
=

∑

i
=
1


N


(

C

i


⋅

f

i


)


{\displaystyle C=\sum _{i=1}^{N}(C_{i}\cdot f_{i})}
,
where N is the total number of alloy constituents, and Ci and fi denote the specific heat and mass fraction of the i-th constituent.
