For a thermostatted steady state, time integrals of the dissipation function are related to the dissipative flux, J, by the equation

{\displaystyle {\bar {\Omega }}_{t}=-\beta {\overline {J}}_{t}VF_{e}.\,}

We note in passing that the long time average of the dissipation function is a product of the thermodynamic force and the average conjugate thermodynamic flux. It is therefore equal to the spontaneous entropy production in the system. The spontaneous entropy production plays a key role in linear irreversible thermodynamics - see de Groot and Mazur "Non-equilibrium thermodynamics" Dover.
The fluctuation theorem (FT) is valid for arbitrary averaging times, t. Let's apply the FT in the long time limit while simultaneously reducing the field so that the product

{\displaystyle \lim _{t\to \infty ,F_{e}\to 0}{\frac {1}{t}}\ln \left({\frac {p(\beta {\overline {J}}_{t}=A)}{p(\beta {\overline {J}}_{t}=-A)}}\right)=-\lim _{t\to \infty ,F_{e}\to 0}AVF_{e},\quad F_{e}^{2}t=c.\,}

Because of the particular way we take the double limit, the negative of the mean value of the flux remains a fixed number of standard deviations away from the mean as the averaging time increases (narrowing the distribution) and the field decreases. This means that as the averaging time gets longer the distribution near the mean flux and its negative, is accurately described by the central limit theorem. This means that the distribution is Gaussian near the mean and its negative so that

{\displaystyle \lim _{t\to \infty ,F_{e}\to 0}{\frac {1}{t}}\ln \left({\frac {p({\overline {J}}_{t})=A}{p({\overline {J}}_{t})=-A}}\right)=\lim _{t\to \infty ,F_{e}\to 0}{\frac {2A\left\langle J\right\rangle _{F_{e}}}{t\sigma _{{\overline {J}}(t)}^{2}}}.}

Combining these two relations yields (after some tedious algebra!) the exact Green–Kubo relation for the linear zero field transport coefficient, namely,

Here are the details of the proof of Green–Kubo relations from the FT. A proof using only elementary quantum mechanics was given by Zwanzig.
