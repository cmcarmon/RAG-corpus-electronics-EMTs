Apart from linear combinations of the above cases (such as
the shell of ﬁnite thickness), the last case that can be derived
with ease from Gauss’s law is the case of the inﬁnite charged
plane. If a Gaussian surface in the form of a pillbox is drawn
cutting through the surface of a plane of charge, symmetry
dictates that equal amounts of ﬂux must exit the pillbox above
and below the plane. Thus, the result at the bottom of Table 2.1
is obtained.
