Unless you carry a badge (a real one, not the one in your toy box), you can’t 
arrest any bad guys when you set off the warbling siren that you build in this 
project, shown in Figure 17-6. But the siren sounds cool, and you can use it as 
an alarm to notify you if somebody’s getting at your secret stash of baseball 
cards, vintage Frank Sinatra records, a signed copy of Mister Spock’s Music 
from Outer Space record, or whatever.
