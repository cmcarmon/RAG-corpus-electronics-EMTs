Ideal ﬁlter: An ideal ﬁlter is a system that completely rejects sinusoidal inputs of the form x(t) = A cos wt,
–¥  <  t  < ¥,  for  w  within  a  certain  frequency  range,  and  does  not  attenuate  sinusoidal  inputs  whose
frequencies are outside this range. There are four basic types of ideal ﬁlters:low-pass, high-pass, bandpass,
and bandstop.
