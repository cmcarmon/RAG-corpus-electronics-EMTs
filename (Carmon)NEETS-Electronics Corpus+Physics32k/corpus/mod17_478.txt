Experience with satellite communications has demonstrated that satellite systems can satisfy many 
military requirements. They are reliable, survivable, secure, and a cost effective method of 
telecommunications. You can easily see that satellites are the ideal, if not often the only, solution to 
problems of communicating with highly mobile forces. Satellites, if properly used, provide much needed 
options to large, fixed-ground installations.
