The crystals used in oscillator circuits are thin sheets, or wafers, cut from natural or synthetic quartz 
and ground to a specific thickness to obtain the desired resonant frequency. The crystals are mounted in 
holders, which support them physically and provide electrodes by which voltage is applied. The holder 
must allow the crystals freedom for vibration. There are many different types of holders. One type is 
shown in figure 2-5.
