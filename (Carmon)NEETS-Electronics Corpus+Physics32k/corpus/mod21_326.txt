The Maxwell bridge, shown in figure 3-1, is used for the measurement of inductance and inductive  
Q. This bridge is similar to the Hay bridge because it also measures inductance by comparison with a 
standard capacitor of known characteristics. Notice, in particular, that capacitor C B is connected in 
parallel with resistor R B. In connection with this difference, the requirement of an accurately known 
frequency is removed. This bridge circuit is employed for measuring the inductance of inductors having 
large losses; i.e., low Q. The range of this type of instrument is much greater than that of the Hay bridge; 
values ranging from 1 microhenry to 1,000 henries are measurable, with an error of only 2%.
