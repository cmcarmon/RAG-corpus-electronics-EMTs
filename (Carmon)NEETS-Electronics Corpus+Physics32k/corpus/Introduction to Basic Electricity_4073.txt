the shape of a waveform. Sine waves may have to 
be changed to square waves, rectangular waveforms 
may have to be changed to pulse waveforms, and pulse 
waveforms may have to be changed to square or rect-
angular waveforms. Waveforms can be analyzed by 
two methods. Analyzing a waveform by its amplitude 
per unit of time is called a time-domain analysis. Ana-
lyzing a waveform by the sine waves that make it up 
is called a frequency-domain analysis. This concept 
assumes that all periodic waveforms are composed of 
sine waves.
