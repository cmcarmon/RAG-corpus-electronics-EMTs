Because high peak power and radio frequencies are produced by radar transmitters, special 
procedures are used to measure output power. High peak power is needed in some radar transmitters to 
produce strong echos at long ranges. Low average power is also desirable because it enables transmitter 
components to be compact, more reliable, and to remain cooler during operation. Because of these 
considerations, the lowest possible duty cycle (pw x prf) must be used for best operation. The 
relationships of peak power, average power, and duty cycle were described in chapter 1. Peak power in a 
radar is primarily a design consideration. It depends on the interrelationships between average power, 
pulse width, and pulse-repetition time.
