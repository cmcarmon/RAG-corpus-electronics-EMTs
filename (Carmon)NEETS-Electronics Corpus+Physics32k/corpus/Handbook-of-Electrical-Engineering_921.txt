The  four  D  components  represent  the  different  possible  charge  states  for  the  impurity:  (x)  neutral,  (+)
positive, (â€“) negative, (=) doubly negatively charged. ni is the intrinsic carrier concentration, which depends
only on temperature. Each D component is in turn given by an expression of the type
