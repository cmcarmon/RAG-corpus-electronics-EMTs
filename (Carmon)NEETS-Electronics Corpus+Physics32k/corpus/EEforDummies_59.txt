The strength of an electric current is defined by how many charge carriers 
(usually electrons) pass a fixed point in one second, and is measured in units 
called amperes, or amps (abbreviated as A). One ampere is defined to be 
6,241,000,000,000,000,000 electrons per second. (A more concise way to express 
this quantity, using scientific notation, is 6.241 x 1018.) Measuring electric current 
is analogous to measuring water flow in gallons per minute or liters per second, 
for instance. The symbol I is used to represent the strength of an electric cur-
rent. (It may help to think of I as representing the intensity of the current.)
