Problem 3.27: Linear, Time-Invariant Systems
For a system to be completely characterized by a transfer function, it needs not only be linear, but also
to be time-invariant. A system is said to be time-invariant if delaying the input delays the output by the
same amount. Mathematically, if S [x (t)] = y (t), meaning y (t) is the output of a system S [•] when x (t)
is the input, S [•] is the time-invariant if S [x (t − τ )] = y (t − τ ) for all delays τ and all inputs x (t). Note
that both linear and nonlinear systems have this property. For example, a system that squares its input is
time-invariant.
(a) Show that if a circuit has ﬁxed circuit elements (their values don’t change over time), its input-output
relationship is time-invariant. Hint: Consider the diﬀerential equation that describes a circuit’s input-
output relationship. What is its general form? Examine the derivative(s) of delayed signals.
