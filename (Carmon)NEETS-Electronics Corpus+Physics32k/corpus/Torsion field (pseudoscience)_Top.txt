A torsion field (also called axion field, spin field, spinor field, and microlepton field) is a feature of a pseudoscientific theory of energy in which the quantum spin of particles can be used to cause emanations lacking mass and energy to carry information through vacuum orders of magnitude faster than the speed of light. This theory was a base of a number of various pseudoscientific claims and scams.
