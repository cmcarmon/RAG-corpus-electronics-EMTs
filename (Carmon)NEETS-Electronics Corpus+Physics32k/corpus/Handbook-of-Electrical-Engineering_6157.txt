LECTRICAL  TECHNOLOGY  has  been  involved  in  aiding  communication  between  a  sender  and  a
receiver of information since the advent of the electrical telegraph. The evolution of electrical commu-
nications technology has been inﬂuenced by both advances in devices for processing and transmitting
electrical signals, as well as the growth and variety of communications applications that have become essential
to modern society. A large fraction of electrical engineers are involved with some aspect of communications,
as evidenced by the size of the IEEE Communications Society, which is second only to the Computer Society.
In  fact,  communication  between  computers  makes  up  a  large  part  of  communication  system  trafﬁc,  and
computers as they employ multiple processors
communication technology is playing an increasing role 
and processors that are geographically distributed.
