A useful class of encoders for speech signals are those obtained from vector quantization. Vector quantizers
are designed using the Lloyd algorithm [Gersho and Gray, 1991]. This is an iterative algorithm in which the
codewords and the nearest neighbor regions are alternatively optimized. This algorithm can be applied to design
vector quantizers for clean and noisy signals using the modiÔ¨Åed distortion measure.
