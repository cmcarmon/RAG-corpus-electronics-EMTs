4.1 Introduction to the Frequency Domain1
In developing ways of analyzing linear circuits, we invented the impedance method because it made solving
circuits easier. Along the way, we developed the notion of a circuit’s frequency response or transfer function.
This notion, which also applies to all linear, time-invariant systems, describes how the circuit responds to a
sinusoidal input when we express it in terms of a complex exponential. We also learned the Superposition
Principle for linear systems: The system’s output to an input consisting of a sum of two signals is the sum
of the system’s outputs to each individual component.
