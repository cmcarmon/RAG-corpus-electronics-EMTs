Semiconductors have too few electrons to have open orbits but can manifest complicated behavior of their
Hall coefﬁcient as a function of the magnitude of B. This occurs because of the relative ease with which one
can pass from the low ﬁeld limit to the high ﬁeld limit and even on to the so-called quantum limit with currently
attainable magnetic ﬁelds. (The latter has not been discussed here.) In general, these different regimes of B will
not  occur  at  the  same  magnitude  of  B  for  all  the  bands  in  a  given  semiconductor,  further  complicating  the
dependence of R on B.
