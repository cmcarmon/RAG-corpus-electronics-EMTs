A VSAT system must employ frequency agility in the remote terminal to use an assigned block of frequencies
within a transponder. Within the assigned frequency band, one or more outbound carriers and a number of
inbound carriers are precisely located. On the VSAT receive or outbound side, the LNB output can be demod-
ulated  directly  using  a  synthesizer-controlled  local  oscillator,  or  further  downconversion  can  be  used  under
synthesizer control to obtain the demodulator input signal at a standard IF frequency such as 70 or 140 MHz.
In the inbound direction, channel selection can be accomplished by two methods. First, the carrier frequency
of the modulator can be shifted to select the appropriate channel and a Ô¨Åxed upconverter may be used to obtain
the RF signal. Second, the synthesizer output frequency may be multiplied up to RF to obtain the carrier, which
may then be modulated directly with the data as described in Cannistraro and McCarter [1990].
