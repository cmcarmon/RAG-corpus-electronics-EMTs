The  Ô¨Årst  two  properties  are  put  to  use  in  dc  circuits,  while  the  third
one is taken advantage of in ac circuits. We will see how useful these
properties  are  in  later  chapters.  For  now,  consider  three  applications
involving capacitors and op amps: integrator, differentiator, and analog
computer.
