Figure 2.1 shows that we can locate a complex number in what we call the complex plane. Here, a,
the real part, is the x-coordinate and b, the imaginary part, is the y-coordinate. From analytic geometry, we
know that locations in the plane can be expressed as the sum of vectors, with the vectors corresponding to
the x and y directions. Consequently, a complex number z can be expressed as the (vector) sum z = a + jb
where j indicates the y-coordinate. This representation is known as the Cartesian form of z. An imaginary
number canâ€™t be numerically added to a real number; rather, this notation for a complex number represents
vector addition, but it provides a convenient notation when we perform arithmetic manipulations.
