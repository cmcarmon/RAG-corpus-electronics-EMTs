The freezing point is the temperature at which the vapor pressures of liquid solvent and solid solvent are equal. When a non-volatile solute is added to a volatile liquid solvent, the solution vapor pressure will be lower than that of the pure solvent. As a result the solid will reach equilibrium with the solution at a lower temperature than with the pure solvent.
