In the event that an individual instrument due for recalibration will not be used for some time in the
future, you may indefinitely postpone the recalibration by affixing an inactive label to the instrument. As
shown in view E of figure 1-1, the INACTIVEâ€”CALIBRATE BEFORE USE label has green lettering
and a white background. The INACTIVE label remains on the instrument until it is recalibrated. The
instrument is not to be used while bearing this label.
