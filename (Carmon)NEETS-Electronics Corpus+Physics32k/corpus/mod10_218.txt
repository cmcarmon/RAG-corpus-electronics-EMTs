The way energy is propagated into free space is a source of great dispute among people concerned 
with it. Although many theories have been proposed, the following theory adequately explains the 
phenomena and has been widely accepted. There are two basic fields associated with every antenna; an 
INDUCTION FIELD and a RADIATION FIELD. The field associated with the energy stored in the 
antenna is the induction field. This field is said to provide no part in the transmission of electromagnetic 
energy through free space. However, without the presence of the induction field, there would be no 
energy radiated.
