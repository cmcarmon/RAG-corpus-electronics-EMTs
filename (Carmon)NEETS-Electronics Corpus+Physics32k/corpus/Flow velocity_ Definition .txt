The flow velocity u of a fluid is a vector field





u

=

u

(

x

,
t
)
,


{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} =\mathbf {u} (\mathbf {x} ,t),}

which gives the velocity of an element of fluid at a position




x




{\displaystyle \mathbf {x} \,}
and time



t
.



{\displaystyle t.\,}

The flow speed q is the length of the flow velocity vector




q
=

|


u


|

{\displaystyle q=||\mathbf {u} ||}

and is a scalar field.
