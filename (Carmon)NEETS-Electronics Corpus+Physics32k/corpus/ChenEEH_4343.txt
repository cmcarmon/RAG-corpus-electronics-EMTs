The relationship of equation 1.21 combines the concepts of a
ring with those of a vector space. Consider now the ring F[l],
which has also a vector space structure. Addition and the
additive identity, 0, are the same for both structures. Moreover,
for two polynomials p(l), q(l) 2 F[l] and a 2 F, equation
1.21 is satisﬁed. Thus, polynomials form an associative algebra.
The question may arise as to why the terminology matrix
algebra was used previously. It is easy to show that the set of
n  n matrices over F is an associative algebra by recognizing
that multiplication of a matrix A by a scalar r can be written
rA ¼ (rI)A.
