Early work on transient stability had concentrated on the reaction of one synchronous machine coupled to
a very large system through a transmission line. The large system can be assumed to be inﬁnite with respect
to the single machine and hence can be modeled as a pure voltage source. The synchronous machine is modeled
by the three phase windings of the stator plus windings on the rotor representing the ﬁeld winding and the
eddy current paths. These are resolved into two axes, one in line with the direct axis of the rotor and the other
(cid:176)
in line with the quadrature axis situated 90
 (electrical) from the direct axis. The ﬁeld winding is on the direct
axis. Equations can be developed which determine the voltage in any winding depending on the current ﬂows
in all the other windings. A full set of differential equations can be produced which allows the response of the
machine to various electrical disturbances to be found. The variables must include rotor angle and rotor speed
which can be evaluated from a knowledge of the power from the turbine into, and power to the system out of
the machine. The great disadvantage with this type of analysis is that the rotor position is constantly changing
as it rotates. As most of the equations involve trigonometrical functions relating to stator and rotor windings,
the matrices must be constantly reevaluated. In the most severe cases of network faults the results, once the dc
transients decay, are balanced. Further, on removal of the fault the network is considered to be balanced. There
is thus much computational effort involved in obtaining detailed information for each of the three phases which
is of little value to the power system engineer. By contrast, this type of analysis is very important to machine
designers. However, programs have been written for multi-machine systems using this method.
