Capacitors C1 and C2 are charged during the peaks 
of the input signal. The ripple frequency is 120 hertz 
because both capacitors C1 and C2 are charged during 
each cycle. Capacitors C1 and C1 split the output volt-
age to the load, so each capacitor is subject to the peak 
value of the input signal.
