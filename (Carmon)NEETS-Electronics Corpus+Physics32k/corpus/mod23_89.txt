Some causes of level errors are permanent and cannot be removed by any means. For example, a
crease in the tape, a hole in the oxide, or a damaged edge. Other causes of level errors are removable and
may be cleaned off the tape. For example, oxide flakes or clumps, metallic particles, or dirt are
removable.
