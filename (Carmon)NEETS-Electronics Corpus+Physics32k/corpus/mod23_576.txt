 1-13. All magnetic heads operate the same
way.  An electric current passes through
the coil.  Magnetic field lines associated
with the electric current follow paths
through the core material.  When the
magnetic field lines get to the head-gap,
some of them spread outside the core to
form a fringing field.  When a recording
medium is passed through this fringing
field, magnetic recording happens.
