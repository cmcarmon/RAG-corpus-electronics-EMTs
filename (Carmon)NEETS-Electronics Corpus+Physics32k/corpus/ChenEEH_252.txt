load ( > 30). This limitation is due to the high ﬁgure of
merit (FOM) of
to
Rds(on) times gate charge (Qg). For today’s device technol-
ogy, the lowest FOM value is around 300(mV  nC). With
such a high FOM value, power devices not only limit the
the VRM’s ability to
VRM’s efﬁciency but also limit
operate at higher operating frequencies. Most of
today’s
VRMs operate at a switching frequency lower than 300 kHz.
This

sponses and creates a need for very large energy storage
components.
