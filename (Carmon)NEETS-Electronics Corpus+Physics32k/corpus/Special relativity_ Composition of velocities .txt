Velocities (speeds) do not simply add. If the observer in S measures an object moving along the x axis at velocity u, then the observer in the S′ system, a frame of reference moving at velocity v in the x direction with respect to S, will measure the object moving with velocity u′ where (from the Lorentz transformations above):

{\displaystyle u'={\frac {dx'}{dt'}}={\frac {\gamma \ (dx-vdt)}{\gamma \ (dt-vdx/c^{2})}}={\frac {(dx/dt)-v}{1-(v/c^{2})(dx/dt)}}={\frac {u-v}{1-uv/c^{2}}}\ .}

The other frame S will measure:

{\displaystyle u={\frac {dx}{dt}}={\frac {\gamma \ (dx'+vdt')}{\gamma \ (dt'+vdx'/c^{2})}}={\frac {(dx'/dt')+v}{1+(v/c^{2})(dx'/dt')}}={\frac {u'+v}{1+u'v/c^{2}}}\ .}

Notice that if the object were moving at the speed of light in the S system (i.e. u = c), then it would also be moving at the speed of light in the S′ system. Also, if both u and v are small with respect to the speed of light, we will recover the intuitive Galilean transformation of velocities

The usual example given is that of a train (frame S′ above) traveling due east with a velocity v with respect to the tracks (frame S). A child inside the train throws a baseball due east with a velocity u′ with respect to the train. In nonrelativistic physics, an observer at rest on the tracks will measure the velocity of the baseball (due east) as u = u′ + v, while in special relativity this is no longer true; instead the velocity of the baseball (due east) is given by the second equation: u = (u′ + v)/(1 + u′v/c2). Again, there is nothing special about the x or east directions. This formalism applies to any direction by considering parallel and perpendicular components of motion to the direction of relative velocity v, see main article for details.
