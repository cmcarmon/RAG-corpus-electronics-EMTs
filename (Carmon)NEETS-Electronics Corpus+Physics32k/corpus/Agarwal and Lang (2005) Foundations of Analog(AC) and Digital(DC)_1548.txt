Figure 10.97 shows a lumped circuit model for the (nonideal) wire of length l in a VLSI
chip, and Figure 10.98 shows the equivalent circuit model for the inverter pair connected
by the nonideal wire based on the SRC model for the MOSFET. Assume that the logic
devices satisfy a static discipline with voltage thresholds given by VIL = VOL = VL and
VIH = VOH = VH, and that the supply voltage is VS.
Suppose INV A is driven by a 0 to 1 transition at its input (denoted vINA) at time t = 0.
Determine tpd,0→1, the propagation delay through INV A for a 0 to 1 transition at
its input. Recall that by our definition tpd,0→1 is the time taken by the input to INV B,
