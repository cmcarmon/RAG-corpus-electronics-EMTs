capable  of  delivering  an  output  current  of  up  to  
500  mA  (note  that  TR1  should  be  fitted  with  a 
small heatsink to conduct away any heat produced). 
Figure  6.22  shows  a  variable  power  supply.  The 
base voltage to the series-pass transistor is derived 
from  a  potentiometer  connected  across  the  zener 
diode, D5. Hence the base voltage is variable from 
0 V to  13  V.  The  transistor  requires  a  substantial 
heatsink  (note  that  TRlâ€™s  dissipation  increases  as 
the output voltage is reduced). 
  Finally,  Fig.  6.23  shows  a  d.c.  power  supply 
three-terminal 
based  on 
integrated  circuit  voltage  regulator. These 
devices  are  available  in  standard  voltage  and 
current  ratings  (e.g.  5  V, 12 V,  15  V  at  1  A,  2  A 
and 5 A) and they provide excellent performance in 
terms  of  output  resistance,  ripple  rejection  and 
voltage regulation.  
 
In  addition,  such  devices  usually  incorporate 
overcurrent  protection  and  can  withstand  a  direct 
short-circuit  placed  across  their  output  terminals. 
This  is  an  essential  feature  in  many  practical 
applications!
