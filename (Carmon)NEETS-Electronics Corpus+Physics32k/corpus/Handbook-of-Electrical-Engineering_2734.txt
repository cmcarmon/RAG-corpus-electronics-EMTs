Introduction
Present-day  silicon  very  large  scale  integration  complementary  metal-oxide  semiconductor  (VLSI  CMOS)
technologies  can  place  and  interconnect  several  million  transistors  (representing  over  a  million  gates)  on  a
single integrated circuit (IC) approximately 1 cm square. Provided with such a vast number of gates, a digital
system designer can implement very sophisticated and complex system functions (including full systems) on
a single IC. However, efÔ¨Åcient design (including optimized performance) of such functions using all these gates
is a complex puzzle of immense complexity. If this technology were to have been provided to the world overnight,
it is doubtful that designers could in fact make use of this vast amount of logic on an IC.
