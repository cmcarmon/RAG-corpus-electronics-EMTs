The units and notation above are used when dealing with the physics of mass spectrometry; however, the m/z notation is used for the independent variable in a mass spectrum. This notation eases data interpretation since it is numerically more related to the unified atomic mass unit. The m refers to the molecular or atomic mass number and z to the charge number of the ion; however, the quantity of m/z is dimensionless by definition. An ion of 100 atomic mass units (m = 100) carrying two charges (z = 2) will be observed at m/z = 50.
