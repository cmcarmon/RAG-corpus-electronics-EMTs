Another breakthrough came in the late 1950â€™s when it was discovered that semiconductor materials
could be combined and treated so that they functioned as an entire circuit or subassembly rather than as a
circuit component. Many names have been given to this solid-circuit concept, such as INTEGRATED
CIRCUITS, MICROELECTRONICS, and MICROCIRCUITRY.
