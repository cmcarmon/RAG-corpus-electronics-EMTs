methods are based on the decomposition of the covariance
matrix into lower and upper triangular matrices, say L and U,
such that Fs ¼ LU . Given this decomposition, equation 3.16
can be solved by sequentially solving Ly ¼ fs and U a^¼ y in
each case using simple algorithms (Golub and van Loan,
1989). The most efﬁcient algorithms for accomplishing the
LU decomposition are based on two methods from linear
algebra (for symmetric matrices): the LDLT decomposition
and the Cholesky or square root decomposition. For details,
see Golub and van Loan (1989). Speciﬁc algorithms are found
in Deller et al. (2000) and Golub and van Loan (1989).
