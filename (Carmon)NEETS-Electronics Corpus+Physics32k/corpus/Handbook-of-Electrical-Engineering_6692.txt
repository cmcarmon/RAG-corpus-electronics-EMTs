Interestingly, the use of adaption sublayers is only a short step away from using adaption layers that would
allow applications to directly interface with any ISO layer. This would result in a hierarchical rather than layered
architecture; to wit: ISORM becomes DoDRM. Indeed, fundamental changes in the national (and worldwide)
communications  infrastructure  appear  to  be  leading  naturally  in  the  hierarchical  direction.  Of  course,  the
indiscriminate  use  of  such  adaptions  would  lead  back  to  the  proliferation  of  incompatible  protocols  and
interfaces, the frustration that led to the current twenty-year standardization crusade! It is refreshing to note
that a return to our former state does not appear to be around the corner; most standardization work is actually
headed in the direction of allowing open systems to intercommunicate.
