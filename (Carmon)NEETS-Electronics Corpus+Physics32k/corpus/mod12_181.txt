By using the correct equation, you can determine the percent of modulation from the modulation 
envelope pattern. This method is useful when the percent of modulation is to be determined using the 
pattern on the screen of an oscilloscope. For example, assume that your oscilloscope is connected to the 
output of a modulator circuit and produces the screen pattern shown in figure 1-42. According to the 
setting of the calibration control, each large division on the vertical scale is equal to 200 volts. By using 
this scale, you can see that the peak carrier amplitude (unmodulated portion) is 400 volts. The peak 
amplitude of the carrier is designated as eo in figure 1-42.
