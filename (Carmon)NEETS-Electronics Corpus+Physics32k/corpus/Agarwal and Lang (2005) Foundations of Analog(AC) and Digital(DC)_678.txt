The terminal voltage-current characteristic of a single solar cell is
shown in Figure 4.59a. Note that this is a sketch of the terminal voltage as a function of
current drawn out (i.e., not the associated variable convention). An array is made by con-
necting a total of 100 such cells as follows: Ten solar cells are connected in series. Ten sets
of these are made. These ten series strips are then connected in parallel (see Figure 4.59b).
