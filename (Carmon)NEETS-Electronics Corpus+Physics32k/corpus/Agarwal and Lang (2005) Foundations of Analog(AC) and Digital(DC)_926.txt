Dependent sources serve to model control of energy or information flow.
Recall that control of energy or information flow was one of five basic processes
identified in Section 1.6 in Chapter 1. Figure 7.5 shows the familiar voltage
controlled current source that we saw in Chapter 2. As we shall illustrate shortly,
small amounts of energy at the control port of such dependent sources can
control or steer huge amounts of energy at the output port.
