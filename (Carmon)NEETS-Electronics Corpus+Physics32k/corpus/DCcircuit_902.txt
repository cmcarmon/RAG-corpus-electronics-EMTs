Even a very small circuit current traveling through the high resistances of each component
in the circuit (especially the measurement electrodeâ€™s glass membrane), will produce relatively
substantial voltage drops across those resistances, seriously reducing the voltage seen by the
meter. Making matters worse is the fact that the voltage differential generated by the mea-
surement electrode is very small, in the millivolt range (ideally 59.16 millivolts per pH unit at
room temperature). The meter used for this task must be very sensitive and have an extremely
high input resistance.
