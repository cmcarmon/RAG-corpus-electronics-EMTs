Germanium  detectors  are  typically  liquid-nitrogen  cooled  and  operated  between  85K  and  100K.  In  this
temperature  range,  leakage  current  is  typically  less  than  40  pA  in “good”  detectors,  and  is  not  a  signiﬁcant
contributor to system noise (400–900 eV). Leakage current increases with temperature and eventually becomes
the predominate noise component. Pehl, Haller, and Cordi [12] reported a leakage current-driven system noise
of 2 KeV at 150K and 7 KeV at 170K for an 8 cm3 planar detector. These authors also reported that above about
120K, the leakage current had an activation energy of approximately one-half the bandgap, and attributed this
to generation at mid-gap surface states. Below 120K, the temperature dependence was milder.
