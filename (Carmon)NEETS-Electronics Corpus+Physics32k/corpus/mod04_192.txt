Removing the shunt too soon permits the heat to flow from the melted solder into the component. 
The shunt should be allowed to remain in place until it cools to room temperature. A clip-on shunt is 
preferred because it requires positive action for removal. It does not require that the technician maintain 
pressure to hold it in place. This leaves both hands free to solder the connection.
