Summary
A  computer’s  memory  system  is  the  repository  for  all  the  information  that  the  CPU  uses  and  produces.  A
perfect memory system is one that can immediately supply any datum that the CPU requests. This ideal memory
is not implementable, however, as the three factors of memory capacity, speed, and cost are directly in opposition.
By staging smaller, faster memories in front of larger, slower, and cheaper memories, the performance of the
memory system may approach that of a perfect memory system—at a reasonable cost. The memory hierarchies
of modern general-purpose computers generally contain registers at the top, followed by one or more levels of
cache memory, main memory, and virtual memory on a magnetic or optical disk.
