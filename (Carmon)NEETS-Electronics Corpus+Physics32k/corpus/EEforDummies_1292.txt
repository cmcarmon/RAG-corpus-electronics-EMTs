All Electronics runs a retail store in the Los Angeles area and sends orders 
worldwide. Most of its stock is new surplus, meaning the merchandise is 
brand-new but has been overstocked by the company. All Electronics has 
a printed catalog, which is also available in PDF format on its website. 
Stock changes frequently, and the latest updates are available only on the 
 website.
