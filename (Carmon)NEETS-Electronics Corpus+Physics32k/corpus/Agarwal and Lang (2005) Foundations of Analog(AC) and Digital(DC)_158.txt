When the voltage v and current i for an element are defined under the
associated variables convention, the power into the element is positive when
both v and i are positive. In other words, energy is pumped into an element
when a positive current i is directed into the voltage terminal marked positive.
Depending on the type of element, the energy is either dissipated or stored.
Conversely, power is supplied by an element when a positive current i is directed
out of the voltage terminal marked positive. When the terminal variables for a
resistor are defined according to associated variables, the power dissipated in
the resistor is a positive quantity, an intuitively satisfying result.
