This  approach  offers  some  differences  over  the  hardwired  approach.  The  advantages  are  that  it  is  more
systematic in implementation, modiﬁable, economical on most designs, and easier to debug. The disadvantages
are  that  it  is  uneconomical  on  simple  machines,  slower,  and  needs  support  software.  Like  all  programs,
microprograms reside in memory. The term “control memory” is commonly used for microprograms.
