A vacuum or vacuum state is defined as a space with as little energy in it as possible. Despite the name the vacuum state still has quantum fields. A true vacuum is a global minimum of energy, and coincides with a local vacuum. This configuration is stable.
It is possible that the process of removing the largest amount of energy and particles possible from a normal space results in a different configuration of quantum fields with a local minimum of energy. This local minimum is called a "false vacuum". In this case, there would be a barrier to entering the true vacuum. Perhaps the barrier is so high that it has never yet been overcome anywhere in the universe.
A false vacuum is unstable due to the quantum tunnelling of instantons to lower energy states. Tunnelling can be caused by quantum fluctuations or the creation of high-energy particles. The false vacuum is a local minimum, but not the lowest energy state.
