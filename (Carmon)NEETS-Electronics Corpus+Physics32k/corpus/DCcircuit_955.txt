Of course, we don’t yet know what the voltage is across R1 or R2, so we can’t insert those
values into the equation as numerical ﬁgures at this point. However, we do know that all three
voltages must algebraically add to zero, so the equation is true. We can go a step further and
express the unknown voltages as the product of the corresponding unknown currents (I1 and
I2) and their respective resistors, following Ohm’s Law (E=IR), as well as eliminate the 0 term:
