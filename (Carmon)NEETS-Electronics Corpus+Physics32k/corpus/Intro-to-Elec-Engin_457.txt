Figure 5.6.1 illustrates in a simpliﬁed manner how a hydraulic pump driven by the engine
continuously supplies pressure to a control valve which in turn supplies the ﬂuid to the two sides
of the booster cylinder. A negative feedback path is established from the booster cylinder through
the mechanical linkage back to the control valve.
