to the appropriate track position containing the desired data. It is a function of a substantial initial start-up
cost to accelerate the disk head (on the order of 6 ms) as well as the number of tracks that must be traversed. Typical
average seek times, i.e., the time to traverse between two randomly selected tracks (approximately 28% of the data
band), are in the range of 10 to 20 ms. The track-to-track seek time is usually below 10 ms and as low as 2 ms.
