SABIO-RK (System for the Analysis of Biochemical Pathways - Reaction Kinetics) is a web-accessible database storing information about biochemical reactions and their kinetic properties.
SABIO-RK comprises a reaction-oriented representation of quantitative information on reaction dynamics based on a given selected publication. This comprises all available kinetic parameters together with their corresponding rate equations, as well as kinetic law and parameter types and experimental and environmental conditions under which the kinetic data were determined. Additionally, SABIO-RK contains information about the underlying biochemical reactions and pathways including their reaction participants, cellular location and detailed information about the enzymes catalysing the reactions.
