The primary goal of Sylvester and Keutzer (2000) was to
examine global interconnect effects and determine if there
were any signiﬁcant road blocks that would prevent National
Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (NTRS) perfor-
mance expectations from being met. Their analysis revealed
that due to global RC delays as well as time-of-ﬂight consider-
ations, the global clock would necessarily be slower than the
achievable local clock frequency. In addition, they found that
cross talk at the global level would not be as signiﬁcant as at the
local level due to the use of large repeaters—their capacitance
would dampen the effects of coupling capacitance. Sylvester
and Keutzer (2000) proposed a wiring hierarchy that comple-
mented the modular design methodology that they proposed
in 1998. This modular methodology proposed the use of
50,000 to 100,000 gate modules of logic to eliminate the
impact of interconnect at the local level. These modules are
arranged together in isochronous (or locally clocked) regions,
which run at a higher clock speed than the global clock. These
isochronous regions come together to form the entire design.
Cong et al. (2001) presented a multilayer gridless detailed
routing system for deep submicrometer physical designs. Their
detailed routing system used a hybrid approach consisting
of two parts: (1) an efﬁcient variable-width variable-spacing
detailed routing engine and (2) a wire-planning algorithm
providing high-level guidance as well as rip-up and reroute
capabilities. They used a nonuniform grid graph, which has
proven to guarantee a gridless connection of the minimum
cost in multilayer variable-width and variable-spacing rout-
ing problems. They suggested further improving their wire-
