One common approach is to expand the equations of motion for an object in terms of its velocity divided by the speed of light, v/c. This approximation is very effective if the velocity is very small, but becomes rather inaccurate if v/c becomes larger than about 0.3. For binary systems of comparable mass, this limit is not reached until the last few cycles of the orbit. EMRIs, however, spend their last thousand to a million cycles in this regime, making the post-Newtonian expansion an inappropriate tool.
