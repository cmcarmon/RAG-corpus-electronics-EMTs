A multi-component and multi-directional extension of the Lagrangian description of the free-surface motion – as used in Gerstner's trochoidal wave – is used in computer graphics for the simulation of ocean waves. For the classical Gerstner wave the fluid motion exactly satisfies the nonlinear, incompressible and inviscid flow equations below the free surface. However, the extended Gerstner waves do in general not satisfy these flow equations exactly (although they satisfy them approximately, i.e. for the linearised Lagrangian description by potential flow). This description of the ocean can be programmed very efficiently by use of the fast Fourier transform (FFT). Moreover, the resulting ocean waves from this process look realistic, as a result of the nonlinear deformation of the free surface (due to the Lagrangian specification of the motion): sharper crests and flatter troughs.
The mathematical description of the free-surface in these Gerstner waves can be as follows: the horizontal coordinates are denoted as



x


{\displaystyle x}
and



z


{\displaystyle z}
, and the vertical coordinate is



y


{\displaystyle y}
. The mean level of the free surface is at

{\displaystyle y=0}
and the positive
