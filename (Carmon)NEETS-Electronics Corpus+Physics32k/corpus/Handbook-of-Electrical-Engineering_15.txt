the solution of which accurately describes the motion of the physical systems. There is, of course, no exception
to this in the ﬁeld of electrical engineering. A physical electrical system such as an ampliﬁer circuit, for example,
is ﬁrst represented by a circuit drawn on paper. The circuit is composed of resistors, capacitors, inductors, and
 and each of these circuit elements is given a symbol together with a mathe-
