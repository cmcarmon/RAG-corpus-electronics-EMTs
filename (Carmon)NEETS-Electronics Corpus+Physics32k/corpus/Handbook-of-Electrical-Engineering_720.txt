Network Functions
A network function or transfer function is the ratio H(s) of the Laplace transform of the output function, say
vo(t), to the Laplace transform of the input, say vi(t), assuming that there is only one input. (If there are multiple
inputs, the transfer function is based on one of them with the others made zero.) Suppose that in the general
case the input and output are related by the differential equation
