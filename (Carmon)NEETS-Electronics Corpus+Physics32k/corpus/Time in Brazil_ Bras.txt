Outside of summer time, this time zone corresponds to UTC−04:00; during summer time, it changes to UTC−03:00, but this change is not followed by Northern states. This time zone is used in the states of Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Rondônia, Roraima, and most of Amazonas. Although this time zone covers about 34% of the land area of Brazil (an area larger than Argentina), little more than 5% of the country's population live there (about 11 million people, less than the city of São Paulo).
Until 2008, the areas of the state of Pará west of the Xingu River and north of the Amazon River were also part of this time zone; then they joined the rest of the state in observing Brasília time (UTC−03:00). Although other changes to Brazilian time zones enacted at that time have since been reverted (see below), Western and Northern Pará still remain in UTC−03:00.
