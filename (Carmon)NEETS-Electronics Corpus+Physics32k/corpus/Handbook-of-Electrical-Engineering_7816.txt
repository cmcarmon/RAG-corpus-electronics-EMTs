FIGURE 80.24 
(a) Away from the facet, the out-
put beam of a diode laser diverges rapidly. In gen-
eral,  the  beam  diameter  along  X  is  different  from
that along Y, which makes the cross section of the
beam elliptical. Also, the radii of curvature Rx and
Ry are not the same, thus creating a certain amount
of astigmatism in the beam. (b) Multi-element col-
limator lens for laser diode applications. Aside from
collimating, this lens also corrects astigmatic aber-
rations of the beam. (c) Beam shaping by deﬂection
at a prism surface. q1 and q2 are related by the Snell’s
law, and the ratio d2/d1 is the same as cos q2/cos q1.
Passage through the prism circularizes the elliptical
cross section of the beam.
