There are many ways to classify the sizes of launch vehicles. The US civilian space agency, NASA, uses a classification scheme that was articulated by the Augustine Commission created to review plans for replacing the Space Shuttle:
A sounding rocket, used to study the atmosphere or perform brief experiments, is only capable of sub-orbital spaceflight and cannot reach orbit.
A small-lift launch vehicle is capable of lifting up to 2,000 kg (4,400 lb) of payload into low Earth orbit (LEO).
A medium-lift launch vehicle is capable of lifting 2,000 to 20,000 kg (4,400 to 44,100 lb) of payload into LEO.
A heavy-lift launch vehicle is capable of lifting 20,000 to 50,000 kg (44,000 to 110,000 lb) of payload into LEO.
A super-heavy lift vehicle is capable of lifting more than 50,000 kg (110,000 lb) of payload into LEO.
Similarly the leading European launch service provider, Arianespace, also uses the "heavy-lift" designation for its >20,000 kg (44,000 lb)-to-LEO Ariane 5 launch vehicle and "medium-lift" for its array of launch vehicles that lift 2,000 to 20,000 kg (4,400 to 44,100 lb) to LEO, including the Starsem/Arianespace Soyuz ST and pre-1999 versions of the Ariane 5. It refers to its 1,500 kg (3,300 lb) to LEO Vega launch vehicle as "light lift".
