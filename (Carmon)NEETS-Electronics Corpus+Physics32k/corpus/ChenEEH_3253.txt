The voltage proﬁles for annual peak load can be found by
plotting the primary voltage values, VP, pu, against the s dis-
tance on the feeder. Because there is no voltage drop at zero
load, the primary voltage values, VP, pu, remain constant. Thus,
the voltage proﬁle for the zero load is a horizontal line.
