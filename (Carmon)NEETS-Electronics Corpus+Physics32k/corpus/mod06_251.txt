Examine figure 1-28, views A and B, again. In view A, the input voltage is +1 volt. At +1 volt Eg,
the plate current is equal to 1 milliampere, with a plate voltage of 250 volts. In view B, the input voltage
(Eg) is raised to +3 volts. ¨( g, as before, is equal to 2 volts. This increase in grid voltage causes plate
current to increase to 2 milliamperes. The change in plate current (¨Ip) is then equal to 1 milliampere.
Thus, transconductance (gm) is equal to:
