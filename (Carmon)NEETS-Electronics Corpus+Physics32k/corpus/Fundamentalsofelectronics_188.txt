Because for linear circuit elements the complex amplitude of voltage is proportional to the complex
amplitude of current— V = ZI — assuming complex exponential sources means circuit elements behave
as if they were resistors, where instead of resistance, we use impedance. Because complex amplitudes
for voltage and current also obey Kirchhoﬀ’s laws, we can solve circuits using voltage and
current divider and the series and parallel combination rules by considering the elements to
be impedances.
3.10 Time and Frequency Domains20
When we ﬁnd the diﬀerential equation relating the source and the output, we are faced with solving the
circuit in what is known as the time domain. What we emphasize here is that it is often easier to ﬁnd
the output if we use impedances. Because impedances depend only on frequency, we ﬁnd ourselves in the
frequency domain. A common error in using impedances is keeping the time-dependent part, the complex
exponential, in the fray. The entire point of using impedances is to get rid of time and concentrate on
frequency. Only after we ﬁnd the result in the frequency domain do we go back to the time domain and put
things back together again.
