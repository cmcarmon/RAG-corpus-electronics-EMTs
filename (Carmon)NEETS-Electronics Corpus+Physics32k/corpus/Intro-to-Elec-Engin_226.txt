From the viewpoints of ease and convenience, it would be a matter of common sense to
choose the current phasor as the reference in the case of series circuits, in which all the elements
are connected in series, and the common quantity for all the elements involved is the current.
Similarly for the case of parallel circuits, in which all the elements are connected in parallel
and the common quantity for all the elements involved is the voltage, a good choice for the
reference is the voltage phasor. As for the series–parallel circuits, no ﬁrm rule applies to all
situations.
