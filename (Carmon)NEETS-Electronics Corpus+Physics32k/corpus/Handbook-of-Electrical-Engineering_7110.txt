Newer  satellite  architectures  incorporate  digital  modulations  and  on-board  demodulation  of  the  uplink
signals  to  baseband  bits,  subsequent  switching  and  assignment  of  the  baseband  signals  to  an  appropriate
downlink  antenna  beam,  and  re-modulation  of  the  clean  baseband  signals  prior  to  downlink  transmission.

the overall communications link by separating the uplink noise from that of the downlink. The baseband signals
may be those of individual users or they may represent frequency-division multiplexed (FDM) or time-division
multiplexed (TDM) signals from many users.
