Equation (24.53) shows that smaller devices require shallower junctions (smaller rj), thinner oxides (smaller
d), or smaller depletion-layer widths (smaller voltage levels or heavier doping). These requirements introduce
side effects that are difﬁcult to control. For example, if the oxide is made thinner while voltages are not reduced
proportionately, then oxide ﬁelds increase, requiring better oxides. If junction depths are reduced, better control
of processing is required, and the junction resistance is increased due to smaller cross sections. To control this
resistance, various self-aligned contact schemes have been developed to bring the source and drain contacts closer
to  the  gate  [Brews,  1990;  Einspruch  and  Gildenblat,  1989],  reducing  the  resistance  of  these  connections.  If
depletion-layer widths are reduced by increasing the dopant-ion density the driving ability of the MOSFET suffers
because the threshold voltage increases. That is, QD increases in Eq. (24.40), reducing VG – VTH . Thus, for devices
that are not velocity-saturated, that is, devices where VG/L & Fsat, increasing VTH results in slower circuits.
