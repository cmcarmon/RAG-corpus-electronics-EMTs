The  DF  of  two  nonlinearities  in  parallel  equals  the  sum  of  their  individual  DFs,  a  result  very  useful  for
determining DFs, particularly of linear segmented characteristics with multiple break points. Several procedures
[Altherton, 1982] are available for approximating the DF of a given nonlinearity either by numerical integration
or  by  evaluating  the  DF  of  an  approximating  nonlinear  characteristic  deﬁned,  for  example,  by  a  quantized
characteristic,  linear  segmented  characteristic,  or  Fourier  series.  Table  100.3  gives  a  list  of  DFs  for  some
commonly used approximations of nonlinear elements. Several of the results are in terms of the DF for an ideal
saturation characteristic of unit slope, Ns(d/a), deﬁned in Eq. (100.119).
