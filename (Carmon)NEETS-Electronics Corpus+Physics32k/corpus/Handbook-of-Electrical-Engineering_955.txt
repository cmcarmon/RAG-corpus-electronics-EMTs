Extraction vs. Optimization
Extraction has the advantage of being much faster than optimization, but it is not always as accurate. It is also
much harder to supply extraction routines for models that are being developed. Each time you make a change
in  the  model,  you  must  make  suitable  changes  in  the  corresponding  extraction  routine.  For  optimization,
however, no changes are necessary other than the change in the model itself, because least-squares curve ﬁtting
routines are completely general. Also, if anything goes wrong in the extraction algorithm (and no access to the
source code is available), almost nothing can be done to correct the problem. With optimization, one can always
change the range of data, weighting, upper and lower bounds, etc. A least-squares curve ﬁtting program can
be steered toward a correct solution.
