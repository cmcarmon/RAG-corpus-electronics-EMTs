Nicolas Clément (12 January 1779 – 21 November 1841), also known as Mr. Nicolas Calorie, was a French physicist and chemist. Also known as Nicolas Clément-Desormes, he was born in Dijon.
He was a colleague of Charles Desormes, with whom he conducted the Clément-Desormes experiment. The two chemists are also credited with determining an accurate value of gamma in the gas law (see Equation of state) that relates the heat capacity of air when expanded at constant pressure vs. constant temperature. They also conducted research on iodine and played a role in determining that it was an element. This research eventually led others to invent the process of photography, and Clément-Desormes is recognized as a contributor in the early history of that industry. Among their accomplishments was establishing a value for absolute zero.
