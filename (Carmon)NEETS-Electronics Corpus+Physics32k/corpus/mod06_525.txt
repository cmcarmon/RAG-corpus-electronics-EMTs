1-53. The grid voltage on an electron tube is 
increased from 2 volts to 4 volts. This 
causes plate current to increase from 2 
milliamperes to 5.5 milliamperes. This 
same increase in plate current can be 
achieved by keeping the grid at +2 volts 
and raising the plate voltage from 200 
volts to 400 volts. What is the mu of the 
tube?
