Chapter 1 discusses the basic theory of magnetostatics.
Magnetic ﬁeld and energy due to a direct current is deﬁned
based on Ampe`re’s law and the Biot-Savart law. Macroscopic
properties of magnetic material are described. In addition,
domains and hysteresis are introduced. Inductance relating
the magnetic ﬂux to the current is deﬁned. The concept of a
magnetic circuit, which ﬁnds important applications in power
transformers, is also introduced.
