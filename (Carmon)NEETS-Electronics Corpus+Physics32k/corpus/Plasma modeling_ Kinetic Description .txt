The kinetic model is the most fundamental way to describe a plasma, resultantly producing a distribution function




f
(



x

,



v

,
t
)


{\displaystyle f({\vec {x}},{\vec {v}},t)}

where the independent variables






x
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {x}}}
and






v
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {v}}}
are position and velocity, respectively. A kinetic description is achieved by solving the Boltzmann equation or, when the correct description of long-range Coulomb interaction is necessary, by the Vlasov equation which contains self-consistent collective electromagnetic field, or by the Fokker-Planck equation, in which approximations have been used to derive manageable collision terms. The charges and currents produced by the distribution functions self-consistently determine the electromagnetic fields via Maxwell's equations.
