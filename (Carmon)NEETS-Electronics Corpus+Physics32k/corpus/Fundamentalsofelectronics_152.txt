Suppose we want to pass the output signal into a voltage measurement device, such as an oscilloscope or
a voltmeter. In system-theory terms, we want to pass our circuitâ€™s output to a sink. For most applications,
we can represent these measurement devices as a resistor, with the current passing through it driving the
measurement device through some type of display. In circuits, a sink is called a load; thus, we describe a
system-theoretic sink as a load resistance RL. Thus, we have a complete system built from a cascade of
three systems: a source, a signal processing system (simple as it is), and a sink.
