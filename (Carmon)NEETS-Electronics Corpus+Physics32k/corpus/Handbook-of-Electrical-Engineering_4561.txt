Time Domain
Time-domain DE modeling can use either implicit or explicit solution methods for developing the time variation
of the solution. An explicit technique is one whereby the update at each time step is given in terms of solved-
for past values of the unknowns and the present excitation, with no interaction permitted between unknowns
within the same time step, and is the approach used in a technique known as ﬁnite-difference time domain
(FDTD). An implicit technique, on the other hand, does allow for interaction of unknowns within the same
time  step  but  can  therefore  require  the  solution  of  a  matrix  equation.  In  spite  of  this  disadvantage,  implicit
techniques are important because they are not subject to Courant instability when cdt > Dc as is an explicit
approach. Books entirely devoted to FDTD and its applications are now becoming available, one of which is
by Kunz and Luebbers (1993).
