Variable-Voltage Techniques
As stated before, the most effective way to reduce power
consumption is to lower the supply voltage with variable
voltage techniques. With the availability of almost ‘‘limitless’’
number of transistors, parallelism can be employed at the chip
level, providing signiﬁcant power savings by reducing the
supply voltage level (Chandraksan et al., 1992).
