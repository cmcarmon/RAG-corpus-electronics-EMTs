introduction	of	the	applications	in	the	1990s,	their	usefulness	hadn’t	come
unappreciated.	The	early	versions	were	not	only	quite	expensive,	but	also,	clearly,
in	need	of	improvement;	later,	the	tools	underwent	continuous	modifications	from
many	electronics	enthusiasts.
According	to	a	study	that	was	led	by	the	engineers	at	Berlin	Technical	University,
a	person	skilled	in	circuitry	can	install	FIB	Technology-based	applications	to	hack
into	a	system’s	security.	For	the	particular	research,	an	IC	with	low-level	security
was	the	focus;	the	objective	was	to	work	around	its	level	of	security	with	the	goal
of	deliberately	eliminating	its	defensive	mechanism.	The	study	was,	of	course,
successful	and	eventually,	it	was	proven	that	even	high-level	tools	can	be	hacked
with	the	same	practice.	And,	as	it	follows,	it	sheds	light	on	the	concept	that	there	is
no	such	thing	as	a	tamper-proof	circuit.
Moreover,	FIB	Technology,	as	a	clever	technique	of	manufacturing,	developing,
and	re-wiring	a	circuit,	has	earned	the	approval	of	different	communities	of
hackers	and	circuit	engineers.	Alongside	its	advantage	of	boosting	a	system’s
performance,	it	reduces	regular	operation	time.	Due	to	its	ingenious	way	of
allowing	an	individual	who’s	working	on	an	electronic	device	to	design	(and	even
re-design	repeatedly)	his	project,	it	was	subjected	to	further	developments.
