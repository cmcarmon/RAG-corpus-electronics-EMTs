Of practical importance is the conjugate symmetry property: When s (t) is real-valued, the spectrum at
negative frequencies equals the complex conjugate of the spectrum at the corresponding positive frequencies.
Consequently, we need only plot the positive frequency portion of the spectrum (we can easily determine the
remainder of the spectrum).
