Cadmium Telluride
Since the 1960s, CdTe has been a candidate photovoltaic material. Evaporation, spraying, screen printing/sin-
tering, and electrodeposition have been used to produce efﬁcient solar cells. Inherent to most solar cell processing
is  a  chemical  treatment  in  CdCl2:  methanol  solutions  at  high  temperature  (~400°C).  The  beneﬁcial  effects  of
this process have been attributed to enhanced grain size, identiﬁcation, evolution of a p-i-n or heterojunction,
surface alteration/passivation, alteration of shallow and/or deep electronic levels, improvement in morphology,
and the formation of an interfacial CdSTe layer. The best solar cell efﬁciency has been measured at 15.8%. There
is some concern that this record efﬁciency has not been exceeded since its report more than 6 years ago.
