The advantages of LFV are
LFV is a non-contact techniques of flow rate measurement.
LFV can be successfully applied for aggressive and high-temperature fluids like liquid metals.
Mean flow rate or mean velocity of fluid can be obtained without depending on flow's inhomogeneities and zones of turbulence.
The limitations of the LFV are
Necessity of temperature control of measurement system because of strong dependence of magnet's magnetic field on temperature. High temperature could cause irretrievable loss of the magnetic properties of permanent magnet (Curie temperature).
Restriction of measurement zone by permanent magnet's dimensions.
Necessity of liquid level's control in case of work with open channel.
Rapid decay of the magnetic fields give rise to tiny forces on the magnet system.
