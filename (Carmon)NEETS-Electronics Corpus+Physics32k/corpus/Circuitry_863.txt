Enclosures 
 
An  appropriate  choice  of  enclosure  is  vitally 
important  to  the  ‘packaging’  of  any  electronic 
equipment.  Not  only  will  the  enclosure  provide 
protection  for  the  equipment  but  it  should  also  be 
attractive  and  add  to  the  functionality  of  the 
equipment.  Enclosures  can  be  divided  into  five 
main types: 
 
(a)  Instrument  cases.  These  are  ideal  for  small 
 
items  of  test  gear  (e.g.  meters  and  signal 
generators) and are available in a wide variety 
 
of  styles  and  sizes.  One  of  the  most  popular 
 
 
low-cost  ranges  of  instrument  cases  is  that 
  manufactured  by  BICC-Vero  and  known  as 
  Veroboxes.  This  enclosure  comprises  plastic 
top  and  bottom  sections  with  anodized 
 
aluminium front and back panels. Other ranges 
 
of instrument cases feature steel and aluminium 
 
 
construction  and  are  thus  eminently  suited  for 
larger projects or those fitted with larger mains 
 
transformers 
 
(such  as  heavy-duty  power 
 
supplies). 
(b)  Plastic  and  diecast  boxes.  These  low-cost 
enclosures  comprise  a  box  with  removable  lid
