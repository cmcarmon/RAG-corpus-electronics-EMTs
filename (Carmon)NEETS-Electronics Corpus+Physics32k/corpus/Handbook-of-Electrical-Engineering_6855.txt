Another type of nonstandard information pattern that arises is that in which the number of measurements
is potentially inﬁnite, but in which there is a cost associated with taking each measurement. This type of model
arises in applications such as the synchronization of wideband communication signals. In such situations, the
error  probabilities  alone  do  not  completely  characterize  the  performance  of  a  detection  system,  since
consideration  must  also  be  given  to  the  cost  of  sampling.  The  ﬁeld  of  sequential  detection  deals  with  the
optimization of detection systems within such constraints. In sequential detectors, the number of measurements
taken becomes a random variable depending on the measurements themselves. A typical performance criterion
for optimizing such a system is to seek a detector that minimizes the expected number of measurements for
given levels of miss and false-alarm probabilities.
