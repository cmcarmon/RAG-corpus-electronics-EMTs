To avoid damage to the device, MOSFETs are usu-
ally shipped with the leads shorted together. Shorting 
techniques include wrapping leads with a shorting wire,  
inserting the device into a shorting ring, pressing the 
device into conductive foam, taping several devices 
 together, shipping in antistatic tubes, and wrapping the 
device in metal foil.
