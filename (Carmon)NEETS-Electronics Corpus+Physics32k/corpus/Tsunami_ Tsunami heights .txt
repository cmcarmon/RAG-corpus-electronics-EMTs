There are different term being used to describe different characteristic of tsunami in term of their height, and each of them are used to refer to different characteristic of a tsunami.
Amplitude, Wave Height, or Tsunami Height: Amplitude of Tsunami refer to its height relative to the normal sea level. It is usually measured at sea level, and it is different from the crest-to-trough height which is commonly used to measure other type of wave height.
Run-up Height, or Inundation Height: The height reached by tsunami on ground above sea level, Maximum run-up height refer to the maximum height reached by water above sea level, which is sometime reported as the maximum height reached by a tsunami.
Flow Depth: Refer to the height of tsunami above ground, regardless of height of the location or sea level.
(Maximum) Water Level: Maximum height above sea level as seen from trace or water mark. Different from maximum run-up height in the sense that they are not necessarily water marks at inundation line/limit.
