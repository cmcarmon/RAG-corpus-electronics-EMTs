A server is an object that is instantiated as an operating system process or task. The server sends messages
to other servers to get work done. The servers “live” on any processor located anywhere on the network. Software
is  distributed  and  so  is  the  work.  OOP  offers  the  greatest  hope  for  distributing  applications  in  this  fashion
without loss of control. Should this scenario come true, the OOP paradigm will not only be appropriate, but
contribute to greater HLL leverage through reusable objects, distributed servers, and delayed binding of methods
to these servers.
