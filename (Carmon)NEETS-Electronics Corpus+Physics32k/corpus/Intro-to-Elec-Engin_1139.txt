For such applications as fans and blowers, a motor needs to develop only a moderate starting
torque. Some loads, like conveyors, however, require a high starting torque to overcome high
static torque and load inertia. The motor designer sometimes makes the starting torque equal to
the maximum torque by choosing the rotor-circuit resistance at startup to be
