For the time-independent operators X and P, ∂A/∂t = 0 so the Heisenberg equation above reduces to:

[

=

{\displaystyle i\hbar {dA \over dt}=[A,H]=AH-HA}
,
where the square brackets [ , ] denote the commutator. For a Hamiltonian which is

{\displaystyle p^{2}/2m+V(x)}
, the X and P operators satisfy:

=

{\displaystyle {dX \over dt}={P \over m},\quad {dP \over dt}=-\nabla V}
,
where the first is classically the velocity, and second is classically the force, or potential gradient. These reproduce Hamilton's form of Newton's laws of motion. In the Heisenberg picture, the X and P operators satisfy the classical equations of motion. You can take the expectation value of both sides of the equation to see that, in any state |ψ⟩:

{\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dt}}\langle P\rangle ={\frac {d}{dt}}\langle \psi |P|\psi \rangle =\langle \psi |(-\nabla V)|\psi \rangle =-\langle \nabla V\rangle \,.}

So Newton's laws are exactly obeyed by the expected values of the operators in any given state. This is Ehrenfest's theorem, which is an obvious corollary of the Heisenberg equations of motion, but is less trivial in the Schrödinger picture, where Ehrenfest discovered it.
