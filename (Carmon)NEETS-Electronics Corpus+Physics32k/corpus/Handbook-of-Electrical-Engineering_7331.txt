Digital dividers are widely available and may either have programmable or ﬁxed division ratios depending
on the application. For optimum noise performance a synchronous type of divider should be used. When a
programmable divider is required to operate at a high frequency (>50 MHz), a dual modulus circuit is normally
 to extend the range of normal programmable divider
used. This circuit uses a technique called 
integrated  circuits  by  using  a  dual  modulus  prescaler  (usually  ECL).  The  dual  modulus  prescaler  is  a  high-
frequency divider that can be programmed to divide by only two sequential values. A second programmable
divider section is then used to control the prescaler. Further details of this type of divider are available from
component manufacturers’ data sheets as well as in the references.
