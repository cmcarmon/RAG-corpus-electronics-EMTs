In addition to these magnetic storage devices, two newer types of secondary storage have
come into use: winchester disks and videodisks (also known as optical disks). The former are sealed
modules that contain both the disk and the read/write mechanism, requiring little maintenance and
allowing higher-density recording. The latter have been introduced recently, with high reliability
and durability and a storage capacity of 1 Gbyte of data (equivalent to almost 400,000 typewritten
pages of information). A typical 14-in optical disk has 40,000 tracks and 25 sectors per track,
with each sector holding up to 1 kbyte of information. While a write-once optical-disk drive is
currently available, a read-and-write drive is being developed.
