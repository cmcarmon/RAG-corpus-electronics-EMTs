Let us begin with the calling operations. Our ﬁrst machine will be the MC68000, one of the classical and
widely available CISC processors. It or one of its progeny is found in many machines and forms the heart of
the Macintosh (not the PowerMac) and the early Sun workstations. Programmatically, the 68000 family shares
a great deal with the very popular VAX family of processors. Both of these CISC designs derive in rather linear
fashion  from  DEC’s  PDP-11  machines  that  were  so  widely  used  in  the  1970s.  Comparisons  to  that  style  of
machine will be done with the SPARC, a RISC processor found in Sun, Solbourne, and other workstations.
