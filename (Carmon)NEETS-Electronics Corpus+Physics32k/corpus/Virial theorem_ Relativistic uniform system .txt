In case when in the physical system the pressure field, the electromagnetic and gravitational fields are taken into account, as well as the field of particles’ acceleration, the virial theorem is written in the relativistic form as follows:

{\displaystyle ~\langle W_{k}\rangle \approx -0.6\sum _{k=1}^{N}\langle \mathbf {F} _{k}\cdot \mathbf {r} _{k}\rangle ,}

where the value

{\displaystyle ~W_{k}\approx \gamma _{c}T}
exceeds the kinetic energy of the particles




T


{\displaystyle ~T}
by a factor equal to the Lorentz factor





γ

c




{\displaystyle ~\gamma _{c}}
of the particles at the center of the system. Under normal conditions we can assume that





γ

c


≈
1


{\displaystyle ~\gamma _{c}\approx 1}
, then we can see that in the virial theorem the kinetic energy is related to the potential energy not by the coefficient 0.5, but rather by the coefficient close to 0.6. The difference from the classical case arises due to considering the pressure field and the field of particles’ acceleration inside the system, while the derivative of the scalar G is not equal to zero and should be considered as the material derivative.
