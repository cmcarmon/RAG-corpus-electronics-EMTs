Single-crystal silicon is still the dominant technology for fabricating PV devices. Polycrystalline, semicrys-
talline, and amorphous silicon technologies are developing rapidly to challenge this. Highly innovative tech-
nologies  such  as  spheral  cells  are  being  introduced  to  reduce  costs.  Concentrator  systems  typically  employ
gallium arsenide or multiple junction cells. Many other materials and thin-Ô¨Ålm technologies are under inves-
tigation as potential candidates.
