Basically, most errors are currently committed when making confusion between priority attribution and criticality management. As priority defines an order between different tasks or messages to be transmitted inside a system, criticality define classes of messages which can have different parameters depending on the current use case. For example, in case of car crash avoidance or obstacle anticipation, camera sensors can suddenly emit messages more often, and so create an overload in the system. That is when we need to make Mixed-Criticality operate : to select messages to absolutely guarantee on the system in these overload cases.
