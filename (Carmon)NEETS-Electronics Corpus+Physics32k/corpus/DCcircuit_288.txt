But how much current is harmful? The answer to that question also depends on several
factors. Individual body chemistry has a signiﬁcant impact on how electric current affects an
individual. Some people are highly sensitive to current, experiencing involuntary muscle con-
traction with shocks from static electricity. Others can draw large sparks from discharging
static electricity and hardly feel it, much less experience a muscle spasm. Despite these dif-
ferences, approximate guidelines have been developed through tests which indicate very little
current being necessary to manifest harmful effects (again, see end of chapter for information
on the source of this data). All current ﬁgures given in milliamps (a milliamp is equal to 1/1000
of an amp):
