The word baud by definition is a unit of modulation rate. You will sometimes see it used to refer to a 
signal element, but this reference is technically incorrect. Baud rate is the reciprocal of the time in 
seconds of the shortest signal element. To find the modulation rate of a signal in bauds, you must divide 
the number 1 by the time duration of the shortest unit interval present in the signal. For example, 22 
milliseconds (.022 seconds) is the time interval of the shortest unit in the five-unit code at 60 words per 
minute. To find the number of bauds corresponding to 60 words per minute, divide 1 by .022. Rounding 
off the result of the division gives us the number 45.5, which is the baud equivalent of 60 words per 
minute. Each increase in words per minute will correspondingly decrease the signal unit time interval. 
(The defense communications system standard speed for teletypewriter operation is 100 words per minute 
or 75 baud.)
