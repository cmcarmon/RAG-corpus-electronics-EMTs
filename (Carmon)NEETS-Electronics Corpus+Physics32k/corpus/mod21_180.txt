Ic MEASUREMENTS.â€”Adjust the METER ZERO control for zero meter indication. Plug the
transistor to be tested into the jack or connect test leads to the device under test. Set the PNP/NPN switch
to correspond with the transistor under test. Set the FUNCTION switch to Ic and the RANGE switch to
X0.1, X1, or X10 as specified by the transistor data book for allowable leakage. Read the amount of
leakage on the bottom scale, and multiply this by the range setting figure as required.
