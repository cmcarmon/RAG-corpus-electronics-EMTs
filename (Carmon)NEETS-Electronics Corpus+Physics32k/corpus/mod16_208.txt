The dBm is an abbreviation used to represent power levels above or below 1 milliwatt. Negative
dBm ( - dBm) represents power levels below 1 milliwatt, and positive dBm (+dBm) represents power
levels above 1 milliwatt. In other words, a dBm value is a specific amount of power; 0 dBm is equal to 1
milliwatt. Briefly stated, the amount of power in a given value of dBm is the power which results if 1
milliwatt is amplified or attenuated by that dB value. For example, 40 dBm represents an actual power
level (watts or milliwatts) that is 40 dB above 1 milliwatt, whereas - 10 dBm represents a power level that
is 10 dB below 1 milliwatt. The formula for finding dBm is a variation of the dB power formula:
