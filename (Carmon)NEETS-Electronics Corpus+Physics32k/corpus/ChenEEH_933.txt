In the general case of a QP problem with any type of con-
straints, systems such as equation 4.56 can be nonlinear and
difÔ¨Åcult to solve. In the case of linear constraints, however, a
solution can be derived in a straightforward manner. To this
end, consider the derivatives rsL(s, l) and rlL(s, l) of the
Lagrangian:
