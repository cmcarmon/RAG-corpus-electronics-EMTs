where  PT is  the  total  power  dissipated  by  the 
semiconductor device(s) and (cid:4)T is the total thermal 
resistance  of 
and  mounting 
arrangement. 
 
Determining the junction temperature 
 
The  temperature  rise  is  simply  the  difference 
between  the  actual  junction  temperature  and  the 
surrounding  (or  ambient)  temperature.  Ultimately, 
the  operating 
is  vitally 
important since exceeding the maximum operating 
junction  temperature  (TJmax) can  result  in  the 
destruction of the semiconductor device! 
 
Now  MT = TJ O TA
 
Combining equations (1) and (2) gives:
