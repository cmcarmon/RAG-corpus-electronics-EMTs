The superior performance of SRAMs derives from their larger signal and the absence of a need to refresh
the stored information as in a DRAM. As a result, SRAMs need fewer sense ampliﬁers. Likewise these ampliﬁers
are not constrained to match the cell pitch of the array. SRAM design engineers have exploited this freedom
to realize higher-performance sense ampliﬁers.
