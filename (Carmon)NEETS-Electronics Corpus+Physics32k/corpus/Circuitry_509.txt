A PIC  microcontroller 
is  a  general-purpose 
microcontroller  device  that  is  normally  used  in  a 
stand-alone  application  to  perform  simple  logic, 
timing  and 
input/output  control.  PIC  devices 
provide  a  flexible  low-cost  solution  that  very 
effectively  bridges  the  gap  between  single-chip 
computers  and  the  use  of  discrete  logic  and  timer 
chips, as explained in Chapter 18. 
  A number  of  PIC  and  microcontroller  devices 
have  been  produced  that  incorporate  a  high-level 
language interpreter. The resident interpreter allows 
developers  to  develop  their  programs  languages 
such as BASIC rather than having to resort to more 
complex  assembly  language.  This  feature  makes 
to  use.  PIC 
PIC  microcontrollers  very  easy 
microcontrollers  are  used 
‘self-contained’ 
applications  involving  logic,  timing  and  simple 
analogue 
to  analogue 
conversion.  Typical  examples  are  the  PIC12C508 
and PIC16C620.
