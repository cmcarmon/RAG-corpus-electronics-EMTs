The Euler force will be felt by a person riding a merry-go-round. As the ride starts, the Euler force will be the apparent force pushing the person to the back of the horse, and as the ride comes to a stop, it will be the apparent force pushing the person towards the front of the horse. A person on a horse close to the perimeter of the merry-go-round will perceive a greater apparent force than a person on a horse closer to the axis of rotation.
The Euler force is perpendicular to the centrifugal force and is in the plane of rotation.
