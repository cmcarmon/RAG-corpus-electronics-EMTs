Summary
The multiplicity of input devices that are available makes it difﬁcult to determine which is most suitable for
any speciﬁc set of requirements. However, the limited functional comparison of the input devices covered in
this section shown in Table 89.4 may be of some use, and in any event is a starting point in this evaluation. It
should  be  noted  that  what  appears  best  at  one  time  may  become  unpopular  or  obsolete  at  a  later  time,  as
occurred for light pens and trackballs, both of which have come back into favor.
