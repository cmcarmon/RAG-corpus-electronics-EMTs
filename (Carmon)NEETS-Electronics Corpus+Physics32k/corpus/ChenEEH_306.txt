an amount equal to qVGB. The energy bands in the semicon-
ductor bend upward, bringing the valence band closer to the
Fermi level that is indicative of a higher hole concentration
under the dielectric. It is important to note that the Fermi level
in the substrate remains invariant even under an applied bias
since no current can ï¬‚ow through the device due to the
presence of an insulator.
