(cid:1) The sequential method of circuit analysis is an intuitive approach that can
often be applied to circuits containing dependent sources when the control
port of the dependent source is ideal. This approach first analyzes the circuit
on the input side of the dependent source, and then separately analyzes the
operation of the output side of the dependent source.
