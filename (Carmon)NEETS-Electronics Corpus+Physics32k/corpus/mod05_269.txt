The number of windings, of course, is fixed when the alternator is manufactured. Also, if the output
frequency is required to be of a constant value, then the speed of the rotating field must be held constant.
This prevents the use of the alternator rpm as a means of controlling the voltage output. Thus, the only
practical method for obtaining voltage control is to control the strength of the rotating magnetic field. The
strength of this electromagnetic field may be varied by changing the amount of current flowing through
the field coil. This is accomplished by varying the amount of voltage applied across the field cod.
