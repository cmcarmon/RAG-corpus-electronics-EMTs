CACSD Packages of Note
As the supporting technology has developed, control engineers mainly working in academia have been actively
engaged  in  developing  tools  to  support  developments  in  control  theory  and  in  combining  these  tools  into
packages.  Early  pioneering  work  was  carried  out  in  Europe  where  the  emphasis  was  on  frequency  response
methods for multivariable control systems analysis and design. Some of the Ô¨Årst CACSD packages were devel-
