Dot Band Matrix Printing. This technology has been employed on some printers used for mid-range com-
puter systems, and, in a sense, is a hybrid technology combining attributes of high-end line band printers with
features  found  in  serial  wire  matrix  printers  (see  below).  Present  designs  also  use  a  moving  metal  band  but
incorporate pixel-size raised bumps instead of etched characters. These bumps (typically 120 on a band) are
positioned at the apex of chevron-shaped springs etched into the band (see Fig. 89.35). Also, timing/position
slots are etched into the band above the spring slots. Instead of one full line of characters being printed in one
cycle, one full line of dots is printed with this technology. Also, each hammer covers typically three character
positions across the page; thus, 45 hammers can cover a page-width of 135 character positions. Hammer cycle
time is typically 1.2 ms and the band speed can be 0.28 m/s or higher. After a line of dots is printed, the paper
is advanced N times until a full character height is achieved.
