In the hydrodynamic analogy of electronic circuits, resistors are equivalent to a 
pipe. As fluid flows through a pipe, frictional drag forces at the walls dissipate energy 
from the flow and thus reducing the pressure, or equivalently, the potential energy of the 
fluid in the pipe. A small resistor is equivalent to a large diameter pipe that will allow for 
a  high  flow  rate,  whereas  a  large  resistor  is  equivalent  to  a  small  diameter  pipe  that 
greatly constricts the flow rate, as shown in Figure 2.1.
