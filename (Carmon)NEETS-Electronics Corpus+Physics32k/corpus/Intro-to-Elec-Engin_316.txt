3.3.16 A ﬁlter is a network employed to select one range
of frequencies while rejecting all other frequen-
cies. A basic building block often used in inte-
grated-circuit ﬁlters is shown in Figure P3.3.16.
Determine the following for the circuit:
(a) Transfer function Vo(s)/Vi(s).
(b) Response vo(t) for vi(t) = u(t).
(c) Driving-point impedance Vi(s)/Ii(s).
