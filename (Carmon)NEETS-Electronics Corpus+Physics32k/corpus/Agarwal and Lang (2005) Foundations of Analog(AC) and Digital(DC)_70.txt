The set of abstractions that transition from science to engineering and
insulate the engineer from scientific minutiae are often derived through the
discretization discipline. Discretization is also referred to as lumping. A discipline
is a self-imposed constraint. The discipline of discretization states that we choose
to deal with discrete elements or ranges and ascribe a single value to each
discrete element or range. Consequently, the discretization discipline requires
us to ignore the distribution of values within a discrete element. Of course, this
discipline requires that systems built on this principle operate within appropriate
constraints so that the single-value assumptions hold. As we will see shortly,
the lumped circuit abstraction that is fundamental to electrical engineering and
computer science is based on lumping or discretizing matter.1 Digital systems
use the digital abstraction, which is based on discretizing signal values. Clocked
digital systems are based on discretizing both signals and time, and digital
systolic arrays are based on discretizing signals, time and space.
