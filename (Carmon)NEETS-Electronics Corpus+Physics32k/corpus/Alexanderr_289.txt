The  capacitor  resists  an  abrupt  change  in  the  voltage  across  it.
According to Eq. (6.4), a discontinuous change in voltage requires
an  inÔ¨Ånite  current,  which  is  physically  impossible.  For  example,
the  voltage  across  a  capacitor  may  take  the  form  shown  in
Fig. 6.7(a), whereas it is not physically possible for the capacitor
voltage to take the form shown in Fig. 6.7(b) because of the abrupt
changes.  Conversely,  the  current  through  a  capacitor  can  change
instantaneously.
