These functions describe the performance of the basic PLL and can now be used to derive synthesis equations.
The  synthesis  equations  will  be  used  to  calculate  circuit  components  that  will  give  a  desired  performance
characteristic. These characteristics usually involve the low-pass corner frequency and shape of the closed-loop
response characteristic [Eq. (76.2)] and determine such things as the loop lock-up time, the ability to track the
input signal, and the output signal noise characteristics.
