Radiated energy is the useful part of the transmitter's signal. However, it represents as much of a loss 
to the antenna as the energy lost in heating the antenna wire. In either case, the dissipated power is equal 
to I2R. In the case of heat losses, the R is real resistance. In the case of radiation, R is an assumed 
resistance; if this resistance were actually present, it would dissipate the same amount of power that the 
antenna takes to radiate the energy. This assumed resistance is referred to as the RADIATION 
RESISTANCE.
