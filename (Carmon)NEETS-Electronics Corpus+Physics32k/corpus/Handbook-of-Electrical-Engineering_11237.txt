The quality of the spatial information derivable from EEG recordings depends upon the number of recording
electrodes, the choice of the reference electrode, and the conductive properties of intracranial and extracranial
structures. The localization of cortical activity from scalp recordings assumes that the potentials recorded from
the scalp reﬂect cortical activity generated in proximity to the recording electrode. Therefore, the greater the
density of recording electrodes, the more accurate the estimate of the spatial distribution of scalp potentials
and the localization of cortical generators. However, since the distance between the cortical source and recording
electrode, as well as the low conductivity of the skull, results in a selective attenuation of small dipole ﬁelds,
most available EEG information can be obtained with an average scalp-electrode spacing of 2 cm.
