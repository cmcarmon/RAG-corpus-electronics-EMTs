4. The Focusing Anodeâ€”in the CRT, this anode serves a dual purpose of attracting electrons from
the area of the control grid and focusing the electrons into a beam. Its function of attracting
electrons from the area of the grid is similar to the action of the plate in a conventional tube. The
focusing action of the anode is similar to that performed by beam-forming plates in the beam-
forming tetrode. Bear in mind, though, that beam-forming plates are negatively charged and
repel electrons into electron sheets, while the focusing anode is positively charged and attracts
electrons into beam.
