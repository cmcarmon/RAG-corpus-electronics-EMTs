Figure 3-16 illustrates the basic bolometer bridge circuit. The bolometer element must be physically 
small to be highly sensitive; it must be equally responsive to low-frequency and rf power; and it must be 
matched to the rf-input power line. The cross-sectional dimension of the bolometer element is 
approximately equal to the skin depth of rf current penetration at the highest frequency of operation. This 
condition permits the dc and rf resistivities to be essentially equal with the reactive component of the 
bolometer impedance at a minimum. Thermistors, which are a type of bolometer, use semiconductor 
material shaped like a bead, with a thicker skin depth and shorter length to minimize standing-wave 
effects. These physical properties assure correspondence between lengthwise low-frequency and rf power 
distribution to provide the necessary inherent accuracy of the bolometer.
