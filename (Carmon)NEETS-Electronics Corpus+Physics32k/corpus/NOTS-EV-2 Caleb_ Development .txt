The Caleb was originally designed as a fast-response orbital launch system, to place small reconnaissance satellites, and other military payloads, into orbit at short notice. The orbital configurations were four-stage vehicles, whilst test launches used one- and two-stage configurations. The project was cancelled due to pressure from the United States Air Force, who were responsible for all other orbital launches conducted by the US military, and no attempts to launch the vehicle into orbit were made.
Caleb was an air-launched rocket, with its two launches being conducted from F4D Skyray #747, the same aircraft used in the Pilot trials. Hi-Hoe was also air-launched, however it was released from an F4H Phantom II, which provided greater performance. SIP launches were conducted from a ground launch pad on San Nicolas Island. The aircraft used for the airborne launches took off from Point Arguello, which later became part of Vandenberg Air Force Base.
