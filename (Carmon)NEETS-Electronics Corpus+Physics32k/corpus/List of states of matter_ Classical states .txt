Solid: A solid holds a definite shape and volume without a container. The molecules are held very close to each other.
Amorphous solid: A solid in which there is no far-range order of the positions of the atoms.
Crystalline solid: A solid in which the constituent atoms, molecules, or ions are packed in a regular order.
Plastic crystal: A molecular solid with long-range positional order but with constituent molecules retaining rotational freedom.
Quasi-crystal: A solid in which the positions of the atoms have long-range order, but is not in a repeating pattern.

Liquid: A mostly non-compressible fluid. Able to conform to the shape of its container but retaining a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure.
Liquid crystal: Properties intermediate between liquids and crystals. Generally, able to flow like a liquid but exhibiting long-range order.
Disordered hyperuniformity: A state similar to a liquid and a crystal in properties. Like a crystal, its particles over large distances exhibit uniform density and are unable to compress. Like a liquid, its particles at smaller distances display the same physical properties in all directions.

Gas: A compressible fluid. Not only will a gas conform to the shape of its container but it will also expand to fill the container.
Plasma: Free charged particles, usually in equal numbers, such as ions and electrons. Unlike gases, plasmas may self-generate magnetic fields and electric currents, and respond strongly and collectively to electromagnetic forces.
