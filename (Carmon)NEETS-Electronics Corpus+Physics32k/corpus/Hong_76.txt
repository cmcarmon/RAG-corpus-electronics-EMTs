While this method for powering a LED is simple and ubiquitous, it is inefficient 
since the power applied to the resistor is dissipated as heat. In the above example, more 
than  one-third  of  the  applied  power  is  lost.  Efficiency  can  be  increased  by  using 
specialized integrated circuits that drive LEDâ€™s using a constant current source.
