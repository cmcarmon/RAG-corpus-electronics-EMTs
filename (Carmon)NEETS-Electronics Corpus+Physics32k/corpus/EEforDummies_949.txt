Soldering safely
The soldering iron you use to join components in an electronics project oper-
ates at temperatures in excess of 700 degrees Fahrenheit. (You can read up 
on soldering in Chapter 15.) That’s about the same temperature as an electric 
stove burner set at high heat. You can imagine how much that hurts if you 
touch it.
