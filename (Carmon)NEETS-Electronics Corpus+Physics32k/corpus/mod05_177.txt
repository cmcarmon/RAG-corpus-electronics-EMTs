Ordinarily, a motor is set up to do a particular job that requires a fixed direction of rotation. 
However, there are times when it is necessary to change the direction of rotation, such as a drive motor 
for a gun turret or missile launcher. Each of these must be able to move in both directions. Remember, the 
connections of either the armature or the field must be reversed, but not both. In such applications, the 
proper connections are brought out to a reversing switch.
