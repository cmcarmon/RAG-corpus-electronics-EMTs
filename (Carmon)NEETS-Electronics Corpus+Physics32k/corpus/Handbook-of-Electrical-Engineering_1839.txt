The beamforming system is said to be robust if it performs satisfactorily despite certain perturbations [Ahmed
and Evans, 1982]. It is possible for each component sk u of su to belong to an interval [sk u â€“ f
k u], and
a robust beamformer will require the existence of at least one weight vector w which will guarantee the output
yu to belong to an output envelope for each su in the input envelope. The robust beamforming problem can be
translated into an optimization problem, which may be tackled by minimizing the value of the array output power
