On the negative-going signal of CP8, all FFs are set, and all the lamps are lighted. The CLK pulse
toggles FF1, making output Q go HIGH. As output Q  goes LOW, the negative-going signal causes FF2
to toggle. As FF2, output Q, goes HIGH, output Q  goes LOW, causing FF3 to toggle and set. As each FF
sets, its indicator lamp lights. The counter is now ready to again start counting down from 1112 with the
next CLK pulse.
