How does the propagation delay impact our digital abstraction? Notice
that the slowly rising output of the inverter now spends a nonzero amount of
time in the invalid output voltage range, namely VIL â†’ VIH. This appears to
violate the static discipline. Recall that the static discipline requires that devices
produce valid output voltages that satisfy the output thresholds when valid input
voltages are supplied. We get around this difficulty by observing that the inverter
output eventually crosses the valid output threshold. Furthermore, notice that
the static discipline does not take a position on time. In other words, it does
not require gates to produce valid outputs instantaneously if the inputs change.
Accordingly, to make the this fact explicit, we can modify the statement of the
static discipline by requiring that devices produce valid output voltages (in a finite
amount of time) that satisfy the output thresholds when valid input voltages are
supplied.
