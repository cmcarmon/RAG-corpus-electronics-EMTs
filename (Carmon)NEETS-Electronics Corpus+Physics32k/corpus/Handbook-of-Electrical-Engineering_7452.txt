In  most  cases  of  practical  interest  the  physical  layer  of  the  communication  system  will  use  continuous  time
(CT) signals, while the simulation will operate in discrete time (DT). For the simulation to be useful, one must
develop DT signals and systems that closely match their CT counterparts. This topic is discussed at length in
introductory DSP texts. A prominent result in this Ô¨Åeld is the Nyquist sampling theorem, which states that if
 the same
a CT signal has no energy above frequency 
  samples  per  second.  Since  the  execution
information  by  sampling  the  CT  signal  at  any  rate  in  excess  of  2 
time of the simulation is proportional to the number of samples it must process, one naturally uses the lowest
sampling rate possible. While the Nyquist theorem should not be violated for arbitrary signals, when the CT
signal is bandpass one can use low-pass equivalent (LPE) waveforms that contain all the information of the
CT signal but can be sampled slower than 2
