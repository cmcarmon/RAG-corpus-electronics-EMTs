In this integral, the real number c is to be selected so that the complex number c +  jw lies entirely within the
region of convergence of X(s) for all values of the imaginary component w. For the important class of rational
Laplace  transform  functions,  there  exists  an  effective  alternate  procedure  that  does  not  necessitate  directly
evaluating this integral. This procedure is generally known as the partial-fraction expansion method.
