Determine 
for  all  t in  the  circuit  shown  in  Fig.  7.22.
Assume that the switch was closed for a long time. It should be noted
that opening a switch in series with an ideal current source creates an
inÔ¨Ånite voltage at the current source terminals. Clearly this is impossi-
ble.  For  the  purposes  of  problem  solving,  we  can  place  a  shunt  resis-
tor  in  parallel  with  the  source  (which  now  makes  it  a  voltage  source
in series with a resistor). In more practical circuits, devices that act like
current sources are, for the most part, electronic circuits. These circuits
will allow the source to act like an ideal current source over its oper-
ating range but voltage-limit it when the load resistor becomes too large
(as in an open circuit).
