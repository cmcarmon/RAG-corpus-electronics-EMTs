Friction is the oldest known method of  producing 
electricity. A glass rod can become charged when rubbed 
with a piece of fur or silk. This is similar to the charge 
you can generate by scuffing your feet across a carpet in a 
dry room. A Van	de	graaf	generator is a device that 
operates using the same principles as the glass rod and is 
capable of producing millions of volts (Figure 12-1).
