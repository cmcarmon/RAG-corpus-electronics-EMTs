In flowing systems, differences in solubility often determine the dissolution-precipitation driven transport of species. This happens when different parts of the system experience different conditions. Even slightly different conditions can results in significance effects given sufficient time.
For example, relatively low solubility compounds are found to be soluble in more extreme environments resulting in geochemical and geological observations of the activity of hydrothermal fluids in the Earth's crust. These are often the source of high quality economic mineral deposits and precious or semi-precious gems. In the same way compounds with low solubility will dissolve over extended time (geological time) resulting in significant effects such as extensive cave systems or Karstic land surfaces.
