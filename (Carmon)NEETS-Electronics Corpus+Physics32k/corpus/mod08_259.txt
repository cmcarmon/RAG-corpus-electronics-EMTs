In figure 2-18, a feedback capacitor (C4) has been added to neutralize the amplifier. This solves the
problem of unwanted degenerative feedback. Except for capacitor C4, this circuit is identical to the circuit
shown in figure 2-17. (When CBC causes regenerative feedback, C4 will still neutralize the amplifier. This
is true because C4 always provides a feedback signal which is 180 degrees out of phase with the feedback
signal caused by CBC.)
