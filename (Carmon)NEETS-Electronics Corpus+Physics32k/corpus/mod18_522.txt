For a distilled-water-cooling system to operate satisfactorily, the temperature, quantity, purity, flow, 
and pressure of the water must be controlled. This control is provided by various valves, regulators, 
sensors, meters, and instruments that measure the necessary characteristics and provide the required 
regulation.
