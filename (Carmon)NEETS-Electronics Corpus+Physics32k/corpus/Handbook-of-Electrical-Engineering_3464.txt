where hr is the effective “radiation” heat transfer coefﬁcient and is approximately equal to 4s F (T1T2)1.5. It is
of interest to note that for temperature differences on the order of 10 K, the radiative heat transfer coefﬁcient,
hr, for a radiationally ideal surface in an absorbing environment, is approximately equal to the heat transfer
coefﬁcient  in  natural  convection  of  air.  Noting  the  form  of  Eq.  (33.7),  the  radiational  thermal  resistance,
analogous to the convective resistance, is seen to equal (hr A)–1.
