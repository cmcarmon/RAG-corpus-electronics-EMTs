A positive value for power indicates that at time t the circuit element is consuming power; a negative value
means it is producing power. With voltage expressed in volts and current in amperes, power deÔ¨Åned this
way has units of watts. Just as in all areas of physics and chemistry, power is the rate at which energy is
consumed or produced. Consequently, energy is the integral of power.
