The  small-signal  characteristics  of  the  npn  transistor  in  its  amplifying  region  is  better  represented  by  the
equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 2.15. Note we have introduced a voltage-controlled voltage source to model
the inﬂuence of the (output) collector-emitter voltage on the (input) base-emitter voltage, and we have placed
a resistor, rc e, in parallel with the collector current source to model the inﬂuence of the collector-emitter voltage
on the collector current.
