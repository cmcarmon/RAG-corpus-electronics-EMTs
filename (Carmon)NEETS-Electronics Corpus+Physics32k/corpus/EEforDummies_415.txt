Keeping an eye on the working voltage
The working voltage, sometimes abbreviated as WV, is the highest voltage 
that the manufacturer recommends placing across a capacitor safely. If you 
exceed the working voltage, you may damage the dielectric, which could 
result in current arcing between the plates, like a lightning strike during a 
storm. You could short out your capacitor and allow all sorts of unwanted 
current to flow â€” and maybe even damage nearby components.
