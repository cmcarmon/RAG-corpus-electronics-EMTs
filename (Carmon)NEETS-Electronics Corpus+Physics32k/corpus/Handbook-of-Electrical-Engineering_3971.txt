Circulators and Isolators
The most important type of ferrite component is a circulator [Fig. 39.10(a) and (b)]. The essential element of
a  circulator  is  a  piece  of  ferrite  which  when  magnetized  becomes  nonreciprocal,  preferring  progression  of
electromagnetic Ô¨Åelds in one circular direction. An ideal circulator has the scattering matrix
