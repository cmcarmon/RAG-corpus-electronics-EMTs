You can use a one‐shot to safely trigger a digital logic device (such as the 
4017 CMOS decade counter described later in this chapter). Mechanical 
switches tend to “bounce” when closed, producing multiple voltage spikes 
which a digital IC can misinterpret as multiple trigger signals. Instead, if you 
trigger a one‐shot with a mechanical switch, and use the output of the one‐
shot to trigger the digital IC, you can effectively “de‐bounce” the switch.
