â€¢ Because pH measurement is a logarithmic representation of ion concentration, there is
an incredible range of process conditions represented in the seemingly simple 0-14 pH
scale. Also, due to the nonlinear nature of the logarithmic scale, a change of 1 pH at the
top end (say, from 12 to 13 pH) does not represent the same quantity of chemical activity
change as a change of 1 pH at the bottom end (say, from 2 to 3 pH). Control system
engineers and technicians must be aware of this dynamic if there is to be any hope of
controlling process pH at a stable value.
