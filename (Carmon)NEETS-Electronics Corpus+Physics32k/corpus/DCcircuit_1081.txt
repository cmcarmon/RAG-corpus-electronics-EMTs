The voltage ﬁgures, as read from left to right, represent voltage drops across the ﬁve respec-
tive resistors, R1 through R5. I could have shown currents as well, but since that would have
required insertion of “dummy” voltage sources in the SPICE netlist, and since we’re primarily
interested in validating the ∆-Y conversion equations and not Ohm’s Law, this will sufﬁce.
