The maximum range of a pulse radar system depends upon CARRIER FREQUENCY, PEAK
POWER of the transmitted pulse, PULSE-REPETITION FREQUENCY (prf) or PULSE REPETITION
RATE (prr), and RECEIVER SENSITIVITY with prf as the primary limiting factor. The peak power of
the pulse determines what maximum range the pulse can travel to a target and still return a usable echo. A
usable echo is the smallest signal detectable by a receiver system that can be processed and presented on
an indicator.
