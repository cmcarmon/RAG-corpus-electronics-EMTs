Figure 2-12 is a block diagram of a basic ssb receiver. It is not significantly different from a
conventional superheterodyne AM receiver. However, a special type of detector and a carrier reinsertion
oscillator must be used. The carrier reinsertion oscillator must furnish a carrier to the detector circuit. The
carrier must be at a frequency which corresponds almost exactly to the position of the carrier used in
producing the original signal.
