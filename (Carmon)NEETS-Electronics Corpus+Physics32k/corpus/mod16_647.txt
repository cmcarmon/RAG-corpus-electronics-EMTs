Figure 6-27 shows some of the displays for a channel that can be obtained for different TRIGGER
LEVEL and TRIGGER SLOPE settings. The level is zero and the slope is positive in view A; view B also
shows a zero level but a negative slope selection. View C shows the effects of a positive trigger level
setting and positive trigger slope setting; view D displays a negative trigger level setting with a positive
trigger slope setting. Views E and F have negative slope settings. The difference is that view E has a
positive trigger level setting, whereas F has a negative trigger level setting.
