A number of different criteria for operation may be estab-
lished, but the three most common ones are speed, depend-
ability/security, and selectivity (WD G5, 1997a, b). All the
criteria need to be combined in a sound engineering solution
to produce the desirable performance, but for the sake of
clarity, each of the criteria is now discussed separately.
