Tire slip, and related slip angle (angle of motion relative to tire), describe the performance of an individual tire. Important concepts about slip and skid include circle of forces or circle of traction, and cornering force. To a first approximation, the tire can withstand approximately the same absolute force relative to the road surface in any direction. Graphically represented, a circle (or ellipse) of force magnitude represents the maximum tire traction, and the force vector can be in any direction up to the limit of the circle without tire slip. A tire that can withstand 0.8 G of force in braking can also withstand 0.8 G of force in turning or in acceleration, or for example approximately 0.56 G of cornering and 0.56 G of braking simultaneously, summing to 0.8 G at a 45 degree angle. Once the force exceeds the limit circle, that tire starts to slip.
Skidding is the vehicle's response to one or more tires slipping. The vehicle dynamics during a skid will depend on whether some or all of the tires are skidding, and whether the car was rotating or turning when the skid began.
