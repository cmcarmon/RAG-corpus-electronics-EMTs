LSAT caseless ammunition is caseless ammunition produced as part of the U.S. Armyâ€™s Lightweight Small Arms Technologies (LSAT) program.
Although less advanced in development than the other ammunition component of the program, the caseless round has already produced significant results. Having replicated Dynamit Nobel's ACR ammunition, the HITP (High Ignition Temperature Propellant, which is hexogen/octogen-based to decrease heat sensitivity) ammunition was modified to a 5.56 mm round. Tests proved the ammunition's usability, and development of the weapon was advanced using knowledge gained from the cased version.
