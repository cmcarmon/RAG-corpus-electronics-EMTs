A.c. circuits that contain both an inductor and a capacitor have interesting characteristics because of 
the opposing effects of L and C. X L and XC may be treated as reactors which are 180 degrees out of 
phase. As shown in figure 1-2, the vector for XL should be plotted above the baseline; vector for XC, 
figure 1-3, should be plotted below the baseline. In a series circuit, the effective reactance, or what is 
termed the RESULTANT REACTANCE, is the difference between the individual reactances. As an 
equation, the resultant reactance is:
