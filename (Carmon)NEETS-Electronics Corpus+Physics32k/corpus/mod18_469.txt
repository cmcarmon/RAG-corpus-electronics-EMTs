Some radar sets have built-in power-measuring equipment; others require the use of general purpose 
test equipment or a special test set. In any case, the measuring instruments are most often referenced to 1 
milliwatt; readings are taken in dBm (a discussion of the decibel measurement system was presented in 
NEETS, Module 11, Microwave Principles).
