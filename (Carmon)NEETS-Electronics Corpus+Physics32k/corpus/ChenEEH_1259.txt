Memory is part of the computer used to store information
such as instructions and data. Ideally, memory should operate
at a speed that is comparable to the CPU so that the CPU can
function as close as possible to its maximum speed. Unfortu-
nately, such memory devices are very expensive and only
economically feasible in very small systems. For larger systems,
the stored information is distributed in a memory hierarchy
using different memory devices with various performance and
cost. A basic organization of multilevel memory is depicted in
Figure 1.2.
