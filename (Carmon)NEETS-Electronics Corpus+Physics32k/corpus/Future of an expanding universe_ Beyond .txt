Beyond 102500 years
What happens after this is speculative. It is possible that a Big Rip or a Big Freeze event may occur far off into the future. The former singularity takes place at a finite scale factor while the latter occurs at an infinitely large radius. Also, the universe may enter a second inflationary epoch, or, assuming that the current vacuum state is a false vacuum, the vacuum may decay into a lower-energy state.
Presumably, extreme low-energy states imply that localized quantum events become major macroscopic phenomena rather than negligible microscopic events because the smallest perturbations make the biggest difference in this era, so there is no telling what may happen to space or time. It is perceived that the laws of "macro-physics" will break down, and the laws of "quantum-physics" will prevail.
The universe could possibly avoid eternal heat death through random quantum tunnelling and quantum fluctuations, given the non-zero probability of producing a new Big Bang in roughly 10101056 years.
Over an infinite time there could be a spontaneous entropy decrease, by a Poincar√© recurrence or through thermal fluctuations (see also fluctuation theorem).
