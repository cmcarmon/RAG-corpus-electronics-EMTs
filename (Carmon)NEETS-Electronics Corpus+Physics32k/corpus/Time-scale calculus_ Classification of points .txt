For any



t
∈

T



{\displaystyle t\in \mathbb {T} }
,



t


{\displaystyle t}
is:
left dense if



ρ
(
t
)
=
t


{\displaystyle \rho (t)=t}

right dense if



σ
(
t
)
=
t


{\displaystyle \sigma (t)=t}

left scattered if



ρ
(
t
)
<
t


{\displaystyle \rho (t)<t}

right scattered if



σ
(
t
)
>
t


{\displaystyle \sigma (t)>t}

dense if both left dense and right dense
isolated if both left scattered and right scattered
