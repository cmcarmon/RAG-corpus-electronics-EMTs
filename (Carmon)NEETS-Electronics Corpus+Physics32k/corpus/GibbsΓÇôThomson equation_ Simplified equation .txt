The Gibbs–Thomson equation may be written in a compact form:




Δ

(

)
=



k

T


x




{\displaystyle \Delta \,T_{m}(x)={\frac {k_{GT}}{x}}}

where the Gibbs–Thomson Coefficient




k

G
T




{\displaystyle k_{GT}}
assumes different values for different liquids and different interfacial geometries (spherical/cylindrical/planar).

is a geometric constant dependent on the interfacial shape,





k

{\displaystyle k_{s}}
is a constant involving parameters specific to the crystalline solid of solid–liquid system, and





k

i




{\displaystyle k_{i}}
is an interfacial energy term.
