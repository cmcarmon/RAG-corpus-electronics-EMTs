The system was used for the first time during combat during the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, with a total of 121 rounds reported fired by the 3rd Infantry Division with 48 vehicle kills attributed to 108 M898 SADARM projectiles. It is noteworthy that the vehicle kills were reported to be tanks even though SADARM was prohibited from testing against or claiming that it was capable of destroying tanks. The requirement document only mentioned "lightly armored vehicles".
