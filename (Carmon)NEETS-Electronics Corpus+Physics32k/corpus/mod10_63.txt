Two waves may have the same wavelength, but the crest of one may rise higher above the reference
line than the crest of the other. Compare wave 1 and wave 2 of figure 1-7 again. The height of a wave
crest above the reference line is called the AMPLITUDE of the wave. The amplitude of a wave gives a
relative indication of the amount of energy the wave transmits. A continuous series of waves, such as A
through Q, having the same amplitude and wavelength, is called a train of waves or WAVE TRAIN.
