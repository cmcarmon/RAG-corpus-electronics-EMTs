Multi-stage amplifiers 
 
Multi-stage amplifiers can easily be produced using 
operational  amplifiers.  Coupling  methods  can  be 
broadly similar to those described earlier in Chapter 
7 (see page 149). As an example, Fig. 8.21 shows a 
two-stage  amplifier  in  which  each  stage  has  a 
tailored frequency response. Note how C1 and C3
provide d.c. isolation between the stages as well as 
helping to determine the low-frequency roll-off.
