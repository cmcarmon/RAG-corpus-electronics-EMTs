Soldering on a printed circuit board requires care-
ful attention because of the heat sensitivity on the 
pads and traces. Too much heat with too much pres-
sure can cause a pad to lift from the board substrate. 
Always apply the tip with a light touchâ€”practice will 
determine approximately how long it needs to be 
held. The soldering iron should rest on the junction 
of the lead and pad rather than being pressed to it  
(Figure 49-19).
