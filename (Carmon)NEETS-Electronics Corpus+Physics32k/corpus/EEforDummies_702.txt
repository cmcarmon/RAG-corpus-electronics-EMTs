Integrated circuits are nothing like discrete components — such as  individual 
resistors, capacitors, and transistors — which have two or more leads con-
nected directly to the component inside the package. The miniature prebuilt 
components inside an IC are already interconnected in one big happy circuit, 
ready to perform a specific task. You just have to add a few ingredients — say, 
power and one or more input signals — and the IC will do its thing. Sounds 
simple, right? Well, it is. You just have to know how to read IC  packages — 
because they all look like black multilegged critters — so you know how to 
make the right connections.
