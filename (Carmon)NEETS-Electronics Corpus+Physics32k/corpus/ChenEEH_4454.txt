The goal of this section is to present methods for the
analysis of suboptimal or reduced order ﬁlters. The idea of
the analysis approach is not difﬁcult, but the implementation
of computationally efﬁcient algorithms can be time consum-
ing. The interested reader should consult the references at the
end of this chapter.
