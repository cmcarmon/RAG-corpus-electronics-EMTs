The USER CALIBRATION label, shown in view D of figure 1-1, has black lettering and a white
background and is affixed when the calibration is performed by the user; however, this label is not
replaced at each calibration. When the label is first attached to the instrument, it is annotated as to the
appropriate calibration interval. Records of calibrations performed, when other than each time used,
should be by normal maintenance practices; that is, in the maintenance log, on maintenance action forms,
and so forth.
