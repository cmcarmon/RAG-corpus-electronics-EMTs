lines of code, whereas the user interface is built using a high-level software development tool. One main part
of system software is written to handle the input–output (I/O) operations. The use of assembly language results
in  the  fast  execution  of  I/O  commands.  The  I/O  software  has  to  deal  with  how  the  basic  input–output
programming tasks such as interrupt and DMA handling are done. The other aspects of system software are
to perform the internal control tasks such as providing trigger pulses for the ADC and SHA, addressing the
input multiplexer, the accessing and editing of the channel-gain list, transferring data into the on-board memory,
and the addition of the clock/calendar information into data. Multitasking software programs are best suited
for many data acquisition systems because it may be necessary to read data from the data acquisition module
and  display  and  print  it  at  the  same  time.  Menu-driven  user  interfaces  are  common  and  have  a  variety  of
functions built into them.
