Forward bias is illustrated in figure 1-18. Notice the positive terminal of the bias battery is connected
to the P-type material and the negative terminal of the battery is connected to the N-type material. The
positive potential repels holes toward the junction where they neutralize some of the negative ions. At the
same time the negative potential repels electrons toward the junction where they neutralize some of the
positive ions. Since ions on both sides of the barrier are being neutralized, the width of the barrier
decreases. Thus, the effect of the battery voltage in the forward-bias direction is to reduce the barrier
potential across the junction and to allow majority carriers to cross the junction. Current flow in the
forward-biased PN junction is relatively simple. An electron leaves the negative terminal of the battery
and moves to the terminal of the N-type material. It enters the N material, where it is the majority carrier
and moves to the edge of the junction barrier. Because of forward bias, the barrier offers less opposition
to the electron and it will pass through the depletion region into the P-type material. The electron loses
energy in overcoming the opposition of the junction barrier, and upon entering the P material, combines
with a hole. The hole was produced when an electron was extracted from the P material by the positive
potential of the battery. The created hole moves through the P material toward the junction where it
combines with an electron.
