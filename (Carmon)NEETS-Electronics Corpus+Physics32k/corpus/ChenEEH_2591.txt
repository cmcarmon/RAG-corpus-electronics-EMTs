polynomial) corresponds to the number of reactive LC ele-
ments required to obtain the desired response. This is called
the order of the ﬁlter. In the case of band-pass and stopband
ﬁlter designs, the order is also related to the number of poles or
zeros of the frequency response (resonance-related effects). A
practical ﬁlter design usually requires an order ranging from 2
to 10.
