In this section, we attempted to provide the reader with a
general notion of the image restoration problem, which is still
an active area of research (Banham and Katsaggetos, 1997). For
a deeper treatment of the subject, the reader is referred to
Gonzalez and Wintz (1977), Jain (1989), Lim (1990), Pratt
(1978), and Rosenfeld and Kak (1982).
