That we should end up with exactly 0 volts across the whole string should be no mystery,
either. Looking at the circuit, we can see that the far left of the string (left side of R1: point
number 2) is directly connected to the far right of the string (right side of battery: point number
2), as necessary to complete the circuit. Since these two points are directly connected, they are
electrically common to each other. And, as such, the voltage between those two electrically
common points must be zero.
