The larger the battery voltage you apply to a capacitor, the larger the charge 
that builds up on each plate, and the larger the voltage drop across the 
capacitor — up to a point. Capacitors have physical limitations: They can 
handle only so much voltage before the dielectric between the plates is over-
come by the amount of electrical energy in the cap and begins to give up 
electrons, resulting in current arcing across the plates. You can read more 
about this in “Keeping an eye on the working voltage,” later in this chapter.
