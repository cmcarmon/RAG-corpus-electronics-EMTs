To measure current, you need to break the circuit and insert your mul-
timeter in series with whatever youâ€™re measuring current through. In a 
series circuit, the current flowing through each component is the same, 
so you can measure the current anywhere you want in the circuit. For 
this example, I tell you how to insert your multimeter between the resis-
tor and the pot.
