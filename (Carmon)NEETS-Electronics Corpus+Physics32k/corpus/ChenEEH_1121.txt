The much-improved state of knowledge about MEMS reli-
ability in recent years does not mean that some concerns about
MEMS reliability will not persist. Engineering designers in
many large and necessarily conservative applications have to
be concerned about the speciÔ¨Åcs of the devices and conditions
relevant to their application. The reliability of MEMS devices
depends on their packaging. For example, the long-term per-
formance of RF resonators and infrared imagers depends on
long-lived vacuum packaging. Shock and vibration resistance
of MEMS devices is critical to many prolonged applications,
and much more data are needed in this arena. MEMS with
built-in test capabilities are sometimes possible, and they are
highly desirable for improved system-level reliability. The
small size and low cost of MEMS devices make it possible to
