Stagnation point flow represents a fluid flow in the immediate neighborhood of solid surface at which fluid approaching the surface divides into different streams or a counterflowing fluid streams encountered in experiments. Although the fluid is stagnant everywhere on the solid surface due to no-slip condition, the name stagnation point refers to the stagnation points of inviscid Euler solutions.
