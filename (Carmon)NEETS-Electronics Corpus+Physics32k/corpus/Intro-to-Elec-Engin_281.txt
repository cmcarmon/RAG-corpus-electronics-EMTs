Due to the greater availability and lower cost of capacitors and the undesirable resistance
usually associated with inductors, virtually all simple ﬁlter designs employ capacitors rather than
inductors, despite the similarity of RL and RC circuits. More sophisticated ﬁlters use two or more
reactive elements in order to have essentially constant or ﬂat H(ω) over the passband and narrow
transition between the passband and the stopband.
