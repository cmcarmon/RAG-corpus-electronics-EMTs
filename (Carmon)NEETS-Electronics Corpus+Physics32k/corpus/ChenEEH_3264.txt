The power system can be roughly separated into three sub-
components: generation, transmission and distribution, and
load. The transmission and distribution network consists of
power transformers, transmission lines, capacitors, reactors,
and protection devices. The vast majority of generation is
produced by synchronous generators. Loads consist of a large
number and a diverse assortment of devices, from home ap-
pliances and lighting to heavy industrial equipment and so-
phisticated electronics. As such, modeling the aggregate effect
is a challenging problem in power system analysis. In the
following sections, the appropriate models for these compon-
ents in the steady-state are introduced.
