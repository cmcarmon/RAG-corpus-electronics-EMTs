A  common  and  extremely  useful  technique  for  increasing  the  information-carrying  capability  of  a  single
transmitting telemetry line is called multiplexing. When it is desirable to monitor different physical parameters,
such as temperature and pressure, it may be wasteful to have duplicating telemetry transmission lines. Multi-
plexing  techniques  can  usually  be  considered  to  be  of  two  types:  frequency  division  multiplexing  and  time
division multiplexing. In the frequency division multiplexing system, different subcarrier frequencies are mod-
ulated by their respective changing physical parameter; these subcarrier frequencies are then used to modulate
the carrier frequency, enabling the transmission of all desired channels of information, simultaneously by one
carrier.  At  the  receiver,  these  subcarrier  frequencies  must  be  individually  removed.  This  is  accomplished  by
Ô¨Ålters  that  allow  any  one  of  the  respective  subcarrier  frequencies  to  pass.  Each  subcarrier  frequency  is  then
converted back to a voltage by the discriminator. The discriminator voltages can be used to actuate recorders
and/or similar devices. Time division telemetry systems may use pulse modulation or pulse code modulation.
In  these  systems  the  information  signal  is  applied,  in  time  sequence,  to  modulate  the  radio  carrier.  The
characteristics of a pulse signal can be affected by modulating its amplitude, frequency, or phase.
