Example 3.6: Node Method Example
In the circuit shown in Figure 3.33, we cannot use the series/parallel combination rules: The vertical
resistor at node 1 keeps the two horizontal 1 Ω resistors from being in series, and the 2 Ω resistor
prevents the two 1 Ω resistors at node 2 from being in series. We really do need the node method
to solve this circuit! Despite having six elements, we need only deﬁne two node voltages. The node
equations are
