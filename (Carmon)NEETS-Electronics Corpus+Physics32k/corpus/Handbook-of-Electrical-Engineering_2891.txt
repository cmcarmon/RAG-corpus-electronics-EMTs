Solvents evaporate from the solder paste. Flux activates, reduces oxides, and evaporates. Both
low- and high-mass components have enough soak time to reach temperature equilibrium.
The solder paste temperature exceeds the liquidus point and reﬂows, wetting both the com-
ponent leads and the board pads. Surface tension effects occur, minimizing wetted volume.
• Cooling:  The solder paste cools below the liquidus point, forming acceptable (shiny and appropriate
