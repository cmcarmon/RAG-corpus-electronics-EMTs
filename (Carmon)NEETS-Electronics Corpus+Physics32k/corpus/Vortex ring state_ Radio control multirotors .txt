Multirotors (also known as drones) are subject to normal rotorcraft aerodynamics, including vortex ring state. Frame design, size and power have an impact on the likelihood of entering the state and recovering from it; generally, the smaller the multirotor the more likely it is to suffer from the effect. Multirotors that do not have altitude hold are also more likely to succumb to operator error, where the pilot drops the craft too fast and into its own propwash; those that are equipped with that feature, on the other hand, tend to control their descent automatically and can usually (but not always) escape the dangerous condition.
