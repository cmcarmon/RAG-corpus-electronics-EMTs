Let us first analyze the circuit qualitatively, referring to the waveforms for
vC and vO in Figure 15.33. As depicted in Figure 15.33, let us assume that the
system starts from rest so the capacitor voltage vC = 0. Thus the inverting
âˆ’
terminal v
of the Op Amp is at 0 V. Let us also assume that the output is in
positive saturation initially, in other words at the positive power supply voltage,
VS. Since the output is fed back to the positive input, we observe that
