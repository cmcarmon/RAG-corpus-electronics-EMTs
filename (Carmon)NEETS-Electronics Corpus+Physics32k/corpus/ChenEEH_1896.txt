general
logic circuits (Johnson, 1989; Lala, 1985; Pradhan,
1990; Roth, 1975). Circuit-level FT and FD mechanisms gener-
ally involve all three forms of redundancies: hardware, infor-
mation, and time. A highly dependable computer system is one
that will have FT/FD mechanisms implemented at least in the
last two levels (system and circuit levels).
