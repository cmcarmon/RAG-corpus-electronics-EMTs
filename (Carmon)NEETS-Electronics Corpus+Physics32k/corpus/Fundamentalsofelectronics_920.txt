Figure 6.24 (Capacity of a Channel) shows how capacity varies with error probability. For example, our (7,4)
Hamming code has an eﬃciency of 0.57, and codes having the same eﬃciency but longer block sizes can be
used on additive noise channels where the signal-to-noise ratio exceeds 0 dB.
6.31 Capacity of a Channel39
In addition to the Noisy Channel Coding Theorem and its converse, Shannon also derived the capacity for a
bandlimited (to W Hz) additive white noise channel. For this case, the signal set is unrestricted, even to the
point that more than one bit can be transmitted each “bit interval.” Instead of constraining channel code
eﬃciency, the revised Noisy Channel Coding Theorem states that some error-correcting code exists such that
as the block length increases, error-free transmission is possible if the source coder’s datarate, B (A) R, is
less than capacity.
