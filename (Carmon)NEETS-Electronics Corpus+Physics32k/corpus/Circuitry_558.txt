 
Returning to Fig. 12.1, the single transistor switch, 
TR1, is provided as a means of rapidly discharging 
an  external  timing  capacitor.  Because  the  series 
chain of resistors, R1, R2 and R3, all have identical 
values, the supply voltage (VCC) is divided equally 
across the three resistors. Hence the voltage at the 
non-inverting  input  of  IC1  is  one-third  of  the
