There are two kinds of energy sources in electronic circuits: voltage sources and 
current  sources.  When  connected  to  an  electronic  circuit,  an  ideal  voltage  source 
maintains a given voltage between its two terminals by providing any amount of current 
necessary  to  do  so.  Similarly,  an  ideal  current  source  maintains  a  given  current  to  a 
circuit by providing any amount of voltage across its terminals necessary to do so.
