Wiring faults are unwanted opens and shorts. Two wires or networks that should be electrically connected, but
are not connected constitute an open. Two wires or networks that should not be electrically connected, but are
connected constitute a short. Wiring faults can be caused by manufacturing defects, such as metallization and
.  Dielectric  faults  are  electrical
etching  problems,  or  aging  defects,  such  as  corrosion  and 
masking  defects
,  chemical  impurities,  material  imperfections,  or
isolation  defects  that  can  be  caused  by 
electrostatic discharge. Threshold faults occur when the turn-on and turn-off voltage potentials of electrical
devices exceed allowed ranges. Soft faults occur when radiation exposure temporarily changes electrical charge
distributions. Such changes can alter circuit voltage potentials, which can, in turn, change logical values, also
. Radiation effects are called “soft” faults because the hardware is not permanently damaged
