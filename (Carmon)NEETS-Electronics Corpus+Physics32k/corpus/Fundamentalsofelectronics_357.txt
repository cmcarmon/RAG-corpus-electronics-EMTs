Property 4.5:
The Fourier series obeys Parseval’s Theorem,6 one of the most important results in signal anal-
ysis. Parseval’s Theorem states that you can calculate a signal’s power in either the time domain
or the frequency domain with very similar formulas.
Theorem 4.1: Parseval’s Theorem
Average power calculated in the time domain equals the power calculated in the frequency domain.
