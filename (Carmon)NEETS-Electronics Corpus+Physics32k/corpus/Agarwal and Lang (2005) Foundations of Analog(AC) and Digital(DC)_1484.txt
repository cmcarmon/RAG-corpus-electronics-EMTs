As an example of the benefits of clocked circuits, consider the digital system
in Figure 10.40 in which two digital circuits are coupled to each other. Both
are fed by the same timebase or clock. Inputs are fed to the first circuit in a
way that input transitions happen only during the low parts of the clock signal.
As shown in Figure 10.40, assume an input sequence 011 is fed to circuit 1.
Similarly it produces outputs (for example 101) that are stable during the high
