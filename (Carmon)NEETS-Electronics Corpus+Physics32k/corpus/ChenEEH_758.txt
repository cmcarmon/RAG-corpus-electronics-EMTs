3. Finally, the more conﬂicts exist in the conﬂict graph,
the more costly the graph is. Indeed, every conﬂict
takes away some freedom for the assignment of arrays
to memories (see also Subsection 2.6.4). In addition,
not every conﬂict carries the same weight. For instance,
a conﬂict between a very small, very heavily accessed
array and a very large, lightly accessed array is not so
costly because it is a good idea for energy efﬁciency to
split these two up over different memories. A conﬂict
between two arrays of similar size, however, is fairly
costly because then the two cannot be stored in the
same memory and potentially have to be combined
with other arrays that do not match very well.
