One of the major results of the absorber theory is the elegant and clear interpretation of the electromagnetic radiation process. A charged particle that experiences acceleration is known to emit electromagnetic waves, i.e., to lose energy. Thus, the Newtonian equation for the particle (



F
=
m
a


{\displaystyle F=ma}
) must contain a dissipative force (damping term), which takes into account this energy loss. In the causal interpretation of electromagnetism, Lorentz and Abraham proposed that such a force, later called Abraham–Lorentz force, is due to the retarded self-interaction of the particle with its own field. This first interpretation, however, is not completely satisfactory, as it leads to divergences in the theory and needs some assumptions on the structure of charge distribution of the particle. Dirac generalized the formula to make it relativistically invariant. While doing so, he also suggested a different interpretation. He showed that the damping term can be expressed in terms of a free field acting on the particle at its own position:

{\displaystyle E^{\text{damping}}(\mathbf {x} _{j},t)={\frac {E_{j}^{\text{ret}}(\mathbf {x} _{j},t)-E_{j}^{\text{adv}}(\mathbf {x} _{j},t)}{2}}.}

However, Dirac did not propose any physical explanation of this interpretation.
A clear and simple explanation can instead be obtained in the framework of absorber theory, starting from the simple idea that each particle does not interact with itself. This is actually the opposite of the first Abraham–Lorentz proposal. The field acting on the particle



j


{\displaystyle j}
at its own position (the point

{\displaystyle x_{j}}
) is then

{\displaystyle E^{\text{tot}}(\mathbf {x} _{j},t)=\sum _{n\neq j}{\frac {E_{n}^{\text{ret}}(\mathbf {x} _{j},t)+E_{n}^{\text{adv}}(\mathbf {x} _{j},t)}{2}}.}

If we sum the free-field term of this expression, we obtain

and, thanks to Dirac's result,

{\displaystyle E^{\text{tot}}(\mathbf {x} _{j},t)=\sum _{n\neq j}E_{n}^{\text{ret}}(\mathbf {x} _{j},t)+E^{\text{damping}}(\mathbf {x} _{j},t).}

Thus, the damping force is obtained without the need for self-interaction, which is known to lead to divergences, and also giving a physical justification to the expression derived by Dirac.
