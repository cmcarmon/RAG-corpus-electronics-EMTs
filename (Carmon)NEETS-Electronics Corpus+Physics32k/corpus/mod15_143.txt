At times it is necessary, because the CT is used to control servo systems, to have the CT output 
reduced to zero volts to prevent any further movement of a load. To accomplish this, it is necessary to 
turn the rotor of the CT through the same number of degrees and in the same direction as the rotor of the 
CX. This places the CT rotor perpendicular to its own stator field and reduces its output to zero volts as 
illustrated in view C.
