7. The  reactive  reserve  basin  constraints  after  an  equipment  outage  and  operating  change  combination
allows optimization of transmission capacity that speciﬁcally corrects that particular equipment outage
and transaction change induced voltage instability with minimum control change [Schlueter, 1998c; f].
8. It requires very little computation per contingency and can ﬁnd multiple contingencies that cause voltage
instability by simulating only a small percentage of the possible multiple contingencies [Schlueter, 1998d].
