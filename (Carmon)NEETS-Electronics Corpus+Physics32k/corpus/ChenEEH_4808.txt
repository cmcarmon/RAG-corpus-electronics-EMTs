This chapter is an introduction to a learning control scheme
that can be implemented in real time. It may be viewed as a
model independent approach to the adaptive critic designs.
The chapter demonstrates the implementation details and
learning results using two illustrative examples. The chapter
also provides a view on the convergence property of the learn-
ing process under the assumption that the two network
models, the critic and the action, can be learned separately.
The analysis of the complete learning process remains to be an
open issue.
