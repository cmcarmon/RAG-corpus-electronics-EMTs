The NA of a multimode fiber having a near-parabolic refractive index profile is measured using
EIA/TIA-455-177. In EIA/TIA-455-177, the fiber NA is measured from the output far-field radiation
pattern. The far-field power distribution describes the emitted power per unit area in the far-field region.
The far-field region is the region far from the fiber-end face. The far-field power distribution describes
the emitted power per unit area as a function of angle Ã¿ some distance away from the fiber-end face. The
distance between the fiber-end face and detector in the far-field region is in the centimeters (cm) range for
multimode fibers and millimeters (mm) range for single mode fibers.
