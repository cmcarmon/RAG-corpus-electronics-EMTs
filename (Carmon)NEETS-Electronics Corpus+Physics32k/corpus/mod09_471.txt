The waveforms for the circuit are shown in views (B) and (C). With no input signals, Q1 is biased 
near saturation by R1. The voltage across C1 is very low (-2.5 volts) because load resistor R3 drops most 
of the applied voltage. The transistor must be cut off to allow C1 to charge. To cut off Q1, a positive 
rectangular wave is used.
