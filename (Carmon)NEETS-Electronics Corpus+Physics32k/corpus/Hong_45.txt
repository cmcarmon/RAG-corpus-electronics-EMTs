be  greatly  simplified  by  Laplace  transforming  of  the  impedances  of  individual  circuit 
elements instead of generalized differential equations that govern circuit behavior. The 
transfer  function  can  then  be  found  by  applying  KVL  and  KCL  simplifications  to  the 
resulting “Laplace circuit”.
