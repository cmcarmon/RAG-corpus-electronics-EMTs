Thus, the time constant is the initial rate of decay, or the time taken for 
to decay
from unity to zero, assuming a constant rate of decay. This initial slope interpretation of
the time constant is often used in the laboratory to ﬁnd  graphically from the response
curve displayed on an oscilloscope. To ﬁnd 
from the response curve, draw the tangent
to the curve at 
as shown in Fig. 7.3. The tangent intercepts with the time axis at
t ⫽ t.
