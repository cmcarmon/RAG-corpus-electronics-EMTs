EXAMPLE 7.3.1
Consider the common-emitter BJT circuit shown in Figure E7.3.1(a). The static characteristics of
the npn silicon BJT are given in Figure E7.3.1(b) along with the load line. Calculate iB for vS = 1
V and 2 V. Then estimate the corresponding values of vCE and iC from the load line, and compute
the voltage ampliﬁcation Av = vCE/vS and the current ampliﬁcation Ai = iC /iB.
