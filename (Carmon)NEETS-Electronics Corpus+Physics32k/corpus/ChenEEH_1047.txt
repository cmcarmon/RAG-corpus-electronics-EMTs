Logic synthesis is the process by which a behavioral or RTL
design is transformed into a logic gate level net list using a
predeÔ¨Åned technology library (Devadas et al., 1994). The triv-
ial attempt for low-power design is to target a library in which
the components are designed to be low power. However, other
techniques are needed since there are opportunities that are
not exploited by the use of a low-power library.
