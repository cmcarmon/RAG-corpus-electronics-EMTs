voltage polarity is a result of current flowing through R1, and this negative voltage opposes the forward 
bias for Q1. However, since the regulated voltage across CR1 has an opposite polarity, the actual bias of 
the transistor is the difference between the two voltages. You should see that the purpose of R2 is to 
function as a current-limiting resistor for the Zener diode.
