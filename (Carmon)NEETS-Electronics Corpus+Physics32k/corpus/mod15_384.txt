An accelerometer is sensitive to gravity when its sensing axis is positioned so gravity can move or 
attempt to move the mass. This is useful in that we can use gravity as a reference for testing purposes, but 
it can be a serious problem because of the errors it may cause in acceleration measurements.  If the unit is 
placed with the sensing axis vertical, the mass will be displaced such that the output is one "G," or one 
unit of gravity. This is done during testing. Then when the sensitive axis is turned so it is horizontal to the 
Earth, the springs center the mass, and the output of the unit is zero.
