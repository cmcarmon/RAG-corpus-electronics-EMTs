The second approach involves the determination of a point on the Mohr circle called the pole or the origin of planes. Any straight line drawn from the pole will intersect the Mohr circle at a point that represents the state of stress on a plane inclined at the same orientation (parallel) in space as that line. Therefore, knowing the stress components



σ


{\displaystyle \sigma }
and



τ


{\displaystyle \tau }
on any particular plane, one can draw a line parallel to that plane through the particular coordinates




σ


n





{\displaystyle \sigma _{\mathrm {n} }}
and




τ


n





{\displaystyle \tau _{\mathrm {n} }}
on the Mohr circle and find the pole as the intersection of such line with the Mohr circle. As an example, let's assume we have a state of stress with stress components




σ

x


,



{\displaystyle \sigma _{x},\!}
,




σ

y


,



{\displaystyle \sigma _{y},\!}
, and




τ

x
y


,



{\displaystyle \tau _{xy},\!}
, as shown on Figure 7. First, we can draw a line from point



B


{\displaystyle B}
parallel to the plane of action of




σ

x




{\displaystyle \sigma _{x}}
, or, if we choose otherwise, a line from point



A


{\displaystyle A}
parallel to the plane of action of




σ

y




{\displaystyle \sigma _{y}}
. The intersection of any of these two lines with the Mohr circle is the pole. Once the pole has been determined, to find the state of stress on a plane making an angle



θ


{\displaystyle \theta }
with the vertical, or in other words a plane having its normal vector forming an angle



θ


{\displaystyle \theta }
with the horizontal plane, then we can draw a line from the pole parallel to that plane (See Figure 7). The normal and shear stresses on that plane are then the coordinates of the point of intersection between the line and the Mohr circle.
