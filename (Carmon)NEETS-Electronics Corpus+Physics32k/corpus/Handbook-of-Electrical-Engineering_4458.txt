During  the  past  decade,  GaAs  monolithic  technology  has  made  tremendous  progress  in  producing  single
and multifunction microwave and millimeter wave circuits using MESFETs, HEMTs, and HBTs. This technology
is exerting a profound impact in producing low-cost and high-volume solid state circuits. Since monolithic
circuits  have  the  advantage  of  bandwidth  and  reproducibility  over  discrete  devices  because  of  wire  bond
elimination,  the  growth  in  millimeter  wave  solid  state  circuits  will  be  based  on  this  technology,  and  a  cost
reduction by a factor greater than 10 is expected in the near future. Wherever possible, the two-terminal devices
such as IMPATT and Gunn diodes will be replaced by the transistors. Future trends in solid state circuits also
include their optical control, tuning, and stabilization.
