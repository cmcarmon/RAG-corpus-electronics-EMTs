TJ, Tisserand's parameter with respect to Jupiter as perturbing body, is frequently used to distinguish asteroids (typically

The minor planet group of damocloids are defined by a Jupiter Tisserand's parameter of 2 or less (TJ â‰¤ 2).
The roughly constant value of the parameter before and after the interaction (encounter) is used to determine whether or not an observed orbiting body is the same as one previously observed in Tisserand's criterion.
The quasi-conservation of Tisserand's parameter constrains the orbits attainable using gravity assist for outer Solar System exploration.
TN, Tisserand's parameter with respect to Neptune, has been suggested to distinguish near-scattered (affected by Neptune) from extended-scattered trans-Neptunian objects (not affected by Neptune; e.g. 90377 Sedna).
Tisserand's parameter could be used to infer the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole at the center of the Milky Way using the motions of orbiting stars.
