distance bells (such as the fog-type insulator) in a string is a
practice followed routinely by users for both line and station
insulation and is quite successful. It is common to see insula-
tors normally rated for the next higher voltage to be used for
lower voltage-rated systems in areas with contamination prob-
lems. This practice works well for most cases, except in those
with severe contamination. In such regions, this method has
only reduced the frequency of outages but not eliminated it,
thus calling for additional measures such as water washing to
prevent contamination-related power interruptions.
