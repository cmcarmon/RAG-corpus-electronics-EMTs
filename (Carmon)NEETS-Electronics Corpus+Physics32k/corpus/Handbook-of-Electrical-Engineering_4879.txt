in the applied electric ﬁeld (the regime where Ohm’s law holds) for two physical situations: (i) when

frequency. Situation (ii) means the electron is able to complete many cyclotron orbits under the inﬂuence of

in  the  time  between  scatterings  and  is  called  the  high  (magnetic)  ﬁeld  limit.  Conversely,  situation  (i)  is
obtained when the electron is scattered in a short time compared to the time necessary to complete one cyclotron

orbit and is known as the low ﬁeld limit. In effect, the solution to Eq. (52.7) is obtained by expanding
