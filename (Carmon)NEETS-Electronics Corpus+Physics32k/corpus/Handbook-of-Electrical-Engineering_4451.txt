Control  components  are  widely  used  in  communication,  radar,  EW,  instrument,  and  other  systems  for  con-
trolling the signal ﬂow or to adjust the phase and amplitude of the signal [Bahl and Bhartia, 1988; Chang, 1990;
Sharma, 1989; Sokolov, 1991]. PIN diodes and MESFETs are extensively used in HMICs and MMICs, respec-
tively,  for  microwave  control  circuits,  such  as  switches,  phase  shifters,  attenuators,  and  limiters.  PIN  diode
circuits have low loss and can handle higher power levels than do MESFET components; conversely, the latter
have great ﬂexibility in the design of integrated subsystems, consume negligible power, and are low cost.
