The simplest case of the gravity turn trajectory is that which describes a point mass vehicle, in a uniform gravitational field, neglecting air resistance. The thrust force






F
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {F}}}
is a vector whose magnitude is a function of time and whose direction can be varied at will. Under these assumptions the differential equation of motion is given by:




m

v

{\displaystyle m{\frac {d{\vec {v}}}{dt}}={\vec {F}}-mg{\hat {k}}\;.}

Here






k
^





{\displaystyle {\hat {k}}}
is a unit vector in the vertical direction and



m


{\displaystyle m}
is the instantaneous vehicle mass. By constraining the thrust vector to point parallel to the velocity and separating the equation of motion into components parallel to






v

{\displaystyle {\vec {v}}}
and those perpendicular to






v

{\displaystyle {\vec {v}}}
we arrive at the following system:

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\dot {v}}&=g(n-\cos {\beta })\;,\\v{\dot {\beta }}&=g\sin {\beta }\;.\\\end{aligned}}}

Here the current thrust to weight ratio has been denoted by

and the current angle between the velocity vector and the vertical by

{\displaystyle \beta =\arccos {({\vec {\tau _{1}}}\cdot {\hat {k}})}}
. This results in a coupled system of equations which can be integrated to obtain the trajectory. However, for all but the simplest case of constant

{\displaystyle n}
over the entire flight, the equations cannot be solved analytically and must be integrated numerically.
