The standard radar interpretation for synthetic apertures is that information coded in the Doppler frequency
shift  can  be  decoded  to  produce  high-resolution  images.  It  is  worth  noting  that  the  synthetic  aperture  can  be
formed even with no motion (zero Doppler shift). For the no-motion case the antenna array interpretation is
appropriate. This approach has been used for acoustic signal processing in nondestructive evaluation systems as
