Alternatively, a constrained optimization approach can be
taken. In this case, performance degradation is acceptable to a
given bound that is represented by performance or timing con-
straints. Thus, power minimization requires optimal exploit-
ation of the slack on performance constraints. Besides power
versus performance, another key trade-off in VLSI design in-
volves power versus ﬂexibility (Benini et al., 2001). Several
researchers have observed that application-speciﬁc designs are
characterized by orders of magnitude more power efﬁcient than
general-purpose systems programmed to perform the same
computation (Nielsen et al., 1994). On the other hand, ﬂexibil-
ity (programmability) is often an indispensable requirement,
and designers must strive to achieve maximum power efﬁciency
without compromising ﬂexibility (Benini et al., 2001).
