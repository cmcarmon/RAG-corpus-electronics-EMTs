The radiation pattern of an array depends on the number and type of antennas
used, the spacing in the array, and the relative phase and magnitude of the excitation
currents. The ability to control the phase of the exciting currents in each element
of the array allows one to electronically scan the main radiated beam. An array that varies the phases of the
exciting currents to scan the radiation pattern through space is called an electronically scanned phased array.
Phased arrays are used extensively in radar applications.
