The induced-channel MOSFET is caused to conduct from source to drain by the electric field that is 
created when a voltage is applied to the gate. For example, assume that a negative voltage is applied to 
the MOSFET in figure 3-56. The effect of the negative voltage modifies the conditions in the substrate 
material. As the gate builds a negative charge, free electrons are repelled, forming a depletion region. 
Once a certain level of depletion has occurred (determined by the composition of the substrate material), 
any additional gate bias attracts positive holes to the surface of the substrate. When enough holes have 
accumulated at the surface channel area, the channel changes from an N-type material to a P-type 
material, since it now has more positive carriers than negative carriers. At this point the channel is 
considered to be to inverted, and the two P-type regions at the source and the drain are now connected by 
a P-type inversion layer or channel. As with the MOSFET, the gate signal determines the amount of 
current flow through the channel as long as the source and drain voltages remain constant. When the gate 
voltage is at zero, essentially no current flows since a gate voltage is required to form a channel.
