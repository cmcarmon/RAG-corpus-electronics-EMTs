Also,  environmental  considerations  must  be  integrated  into  all  aspects  of  economic  behavior,  especially
product and process design, and the design of economic and social systems within which those products are
used  and  disposed.  Environmental  concerns  must  be  internalized  into  technological  systems  and  economic
factors. It is not sufﬁcient to design an energy efﬁcient computer, for example; it is also necessary to ensure
that the product, its components, or its constituent materials can be refurbished or recycled after the customer
is through with it—all of this in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market. This consideration implies
a comprehensive and systems-based approach that is far more fundamental than any we have yet developed.
Industrial  ecology  requires  an  approach  that  is  truly  multidisciplinary.  It  is  important  to  emphasize  that
industrial ecology is an objective ﬁeld of study based on existing scientiﬁc and technological disciplines, not a
form of industrial policy. It is profoundly a systems oriented and comprehensive approach which poses problems
for  most  institutions—the  government,  riddled  with  ﬁefdoms;  academia,  with  rigid  departmental  lines;  and
private ﬁrms, with job slots deﬁned by occupation. Nonetheless, it is all too frequent that industrial ecology is
seen as an economic program by economists, a legal program by lawyers, a technical program by engineers,
and a scientiﬁc program by scientists. It is in part each of these; more importantly, it is all of these.
