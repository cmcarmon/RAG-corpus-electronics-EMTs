I. Veriﬁcation/Simulation of Performance: Before fabricating the masks and proceeding with manufacture
of the ASIC circuit, a ﬁnal veriﬁcation of the ASIC is normally performed. Figure 25.24(b) represents
this step as “golden simulation,” a process based on detailed and accurate simulation tools, tuned to the
process of the foundry and providing the ﬁnal veriﬁcation of desired performance.
