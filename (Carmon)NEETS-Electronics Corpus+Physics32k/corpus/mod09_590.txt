From T0 to T1 the output follows the input because of the increasing emitter-base forward bias. 
However, at T1 the collector voltage reaches −2 volts and D2 is forward biased. D2 conducts and limits 
the output to −2 volts (the value of B3). D2 conducts until T2 when the input decreases below −2 volts. At 
this time, D2 cuts off and the output again follows the input because of the decreasing forward bias on 
Q1. At T3 the input reaches −8 volts and forward biases D1. D1 conducts and any further increase 
(beyond −8 volts) of the input has no effect on the output. When the input returns to a value more positive 
than −8 volts, D1 cuts off and the output again follows the input. This circuit action is the same for all 
inputs. The output remains the same as the input except that both positive and negative extremes are 
clamped at −2 and −8 volts, respectively.
