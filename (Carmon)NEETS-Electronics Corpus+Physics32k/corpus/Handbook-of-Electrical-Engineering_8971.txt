There  are  two  types  of  SAW  systems  in  use,  namely
those using reﬂective techniques and those using atten-
uation as the source of position information. The reﬂec-
tive systems are similar to sonar where the time from the
source  to  the  pointing  ﬁnger  and  then  from  the  ﬁnger
to  the  receiver  is  measured  to  arrive  at  ﬁnger  location.
The  attenuation  technology  is  illustrated  in  Fig. 89.17
and consists of two transducers, two receivers, and four
reﬂector  strips,  all  mounted  on  a  glass  substrate.  One
transducer-receiver pair is used for X and the other for
Y location. Figure 89.17 shows the X axis pair, and the
transducer transmits a burst of acoustic energy in a hor-
izontal  wave.  The  wave  is  partially  reﬂected  by  the  top
reﬂector strips and travels down to the bottom strip where the reﬂectors are at an angle such that it is reﬂected
to the lower left corner receiver. The wave now has a long rectangular shape, and each point in time corresponds
to a speciﬁc vertical path across the substrate. The Y axis is scanned in the same fashion after the X wave dies
out. Then, when the ﬁnger touches the substrate, its water content absorbs some of the energy in the wave,
and the wave is attenuated. The dip in the wave amplitude corresponds to the amount of absorbed energy, and
the time of the lowest point can be determined, allowing the location of the ﬁnger to be calculated. Finally, in
addition to the X and Y coordinates, a Z coordinate can be determined, depending on how hard the user presses.
This depends on surface contact, which affects the amount of attenuation. The advantages of this system are
high resolution, speed of transmission, and the availability of a Z axis component. Its main disadvantages are
the variation in moisture content in ﬁngers and sensitivity to local moisture on the substrate. However, it is
being used in developmental units and should be considered as another input device technology.
