Using  this  expression,  it  is  possible  to  apply  the  usual  electromagnetic  analysis  to  Ô¨Ånd  the  inductance  (Lo),
capacitance (Co), and resistance (Ro) per unit length along a parallel plate transmission line. The results of such
analysis for typical cases are summarized in Table 53.1.
