TBE jitter introduces noise or unwanted frequency modulation (when using FM recording
techniques) into the magnetic tape recording process. It can also cause a loss of accuracy in pulse-
duration modulation (PDM), pulse-coded modulation (PCM), or other magnetic recordings where precise
timing relationships exist between two or more signals.
