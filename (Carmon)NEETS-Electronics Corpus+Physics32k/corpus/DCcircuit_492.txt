Not only does the ”table” method simplify the management of all relevant quantities, it also
facilitates cross-checking of answers by making it easy to solve for the original unknown vari-
ables through other methods, or by working backwards to solve for the initially given values
from your solutions. For example, if you have just solved for all unknown voltages, currents,
and resistances in a circuit, you can check your work by adding a row at the bottom for power
calculations on each resistor, seeing whether or not all the individual power values add up to
the total power. If not, then you must have made a mistake somewhere! While this technique
of ”cross-checking” your work is nothing new, using the table to arrange all the data for the
cross-check(s) results in a minimum of confusion.
