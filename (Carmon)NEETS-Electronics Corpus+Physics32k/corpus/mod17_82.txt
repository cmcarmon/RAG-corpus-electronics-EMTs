The communications commitments of the Navy now cover the face of the earth. New sea frontiers to 
the north have opened a four-million-square-mile, ice-covered ocean of strategic importance. Our Navy 
must maintain control of the operating forces in an ever expanding coverage area. This additional area 
requires changes in communications capacity, range, and reliability. Additional needs have been 
particularly great in the North Atlantic and the newly opened Arctic Ocean. High-frequency circuits are 
too unreliable in these areas because of local atmospheric disturbances.
