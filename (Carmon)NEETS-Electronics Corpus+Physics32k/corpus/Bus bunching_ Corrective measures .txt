When a transit vehicle becomes overcrowded as well as delayed, the transit operator may choose to designate the vehicle as a temporary "express" trip. This means that the expedited vehicle will bypass many of its usual stops, operating on a limited stop basis, or heading non-stop directly to the route terminus. This usually entails some additional delay, needed to notify passengers already on board, and to let some of them to disembark to avoid being taken past their intended destinations.
These non-express passengers, as well as others waiting to board, may be told that another less-crowded vehicle is "right behind them". This may or may not be true; in extreme cases, the following vehicle(s) may also be overcrowded or even more severely delayed. On rare occasions, some long-suffering riders have violently expressed their anger at chronically poor service.
Other corrective measures include adding more vehicle trips or higher-capacity equipment. Aside from possible extra costs, the chief difficulty is in responding quickly enough to delays and overcrowding before they spontaneously dissipate. It is preferable to closely monitor transit headways and take immediate corrective measures, rather than allowing delays to "snowball", causing a near-complete breakdown of service.
