INTERNAL SHUNTS FOR METERS IN THE MILLIAMPERE RANGE.â€”The above method
of computing the shunt resistance is satisfactory in most cases; however, it can only be used when the line
current is in the ampere range and the meter current is relatively small compared to the load current. In
such cases, you can use an approximate value of resistance for the shunt, as was done above. However,
when the line current is in the milliampere range and the coil current becomes an appreciable percentage
of the line current, a more accurate calculation must be made. For example, suppose you desire to use a
meter movement that has a full-scale deflection of 1 milliampere and a coil resistance of 50 ohms to
measure currents up to 10 milliamperes. Using Ohm's law, you can figure the voltage (Ecoil) across the
meter coil (and the shunt) at full-scale deflection, as follows:
