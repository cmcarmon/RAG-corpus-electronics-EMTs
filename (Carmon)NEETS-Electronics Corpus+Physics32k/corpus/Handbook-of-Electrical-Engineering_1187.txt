which  is  commonly  known  as  the  general  Pythagorean  theorem.  This  theorem  is  readily  proven  by  direct
substitution and using the orthogonality of the two vectors. With these preliminaries completed, the celebrated
projection theorem is now given [Luenberger, 1969].
Theorem 1. Let  C  be  a  closed  subspace  of  Hilbert  space  X.  Corresponding  to  any  vector  x ˛  X,  there  is  a
unique  vector  xo ˛  C  such  that ** x  –  xo **  £ 
** x  –  y **  for  all  y ˛  C.  Furthermore,  a  necessary  and  sufﬁcient
condition that xo ˛  C be the unique minimization vector is that x – xo is orthogonal to every vector in C.
