Recursive Modeling of Data
The linear recursive modeling of excitation-response data is of interdisciplinary interest in a variety of appli-
cations. For purposes of simplicity, we will only deal here with the case in which the data is dependent on a
single time variable. The procedure to be described, however, is readily extended to the multidimensional time
variable case. In the one-dimensional time case, there is given the pair of data sequences
