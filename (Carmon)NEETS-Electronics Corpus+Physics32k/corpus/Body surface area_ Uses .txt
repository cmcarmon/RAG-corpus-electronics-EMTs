Examples of uses of the BSA:
Renal clearance usually divided by the BSA i.e. per 1.73 mÂ² to gain an appreciation of the true glomerular filtration rate (GFR);
The Quetelet index uses a somewhat modified form of the BSA;
The cardiac index is a measure of cardiac output divided by the BSA, giving a better approximation of the effective cardiac output;
Chemotherapy is often dosed according to the patient's BSA.
Glucocorticoid dosing is also expressed in terms of BSA for calculating maintenance doses or to compare high dose use with maintenance requirement.
There is some evidence that BSA values are less accurate at extremes of height and weight, where Body Mass Index may be a better estimate (for hemodynamic parameters).
