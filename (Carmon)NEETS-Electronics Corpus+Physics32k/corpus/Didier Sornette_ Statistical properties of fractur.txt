Using a collection of maps centered at the same location but at different scales in Saudi Arabia (meter to hundreds of kilometers, i.e. slightly more than five decades), it was shown that joints and fault patterns display distinct spatial scaling properties within distinct ranges of scales. These transition scales (which quantify the horizontal distribution of brittle structures) can be nicely correlated with the vertical mechanical layering of the host medium (the Earth crust). In particular, fracture patterns can be shown to be rather uniform at scales lower than the thickness of the sedimentary basin, and become heterogeneous and multifractal at larger scales. Those different regimes have been discovered by designing new multifractal analysis techniques (able to take account of the small size of the datasets as well as with irregular geometrical boundary conditions), as well as by introducing a new technique based on 2D anisotropic wavelet analysis. By mapping some joints within the crystalline basement in the same area, it was found that their spatial organization (spacing distribution) displayed discrete scale invariance over more than four decades. Using some other dataset and a theoretical model, Huang et al. also showed that, due to interactions between parallel structures, the length distribution of joints also displays discrete scale invariance.
