Quintana Roo: this eastern state followed CST for an almost-17-year period (1982 to some time in 1998). After more than two years of lobbying by a coalition of local hotel owners with the backing of the state's government, the Federal government approved the change to Quintana Roo's time zone, moving it from Central Standard Time (CST) to Eastern Standard Time (EST). The time change took effect on February 1, 2015.
