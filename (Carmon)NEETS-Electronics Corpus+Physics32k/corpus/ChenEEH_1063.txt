leaks to some internal nodes via paths set by certain changing
inputs during the evaluation cycle. This problem results in
spurious glitches at the outputs not only to affect output stages
driven by the dynamic stage but also to result in additional
power dissipation. Many solutions, such as static bleeder and
precharging internal nodes, will help alleviate the charge-
sharing problem but will result in more power dissipation
and more transistors!
