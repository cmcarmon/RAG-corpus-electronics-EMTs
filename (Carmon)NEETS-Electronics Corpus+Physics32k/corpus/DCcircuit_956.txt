- 28 + 2I2 + 4I1 = 0
You might be wondering why we went through all the trouble of manipulating this equation
from its initial form (-28 + ER2 + ER1). After all, the last two terms are still unknown, so what
advantage is there to expressing them in terms of unknown voltages or as unknown currents
(multiplied by resistances)? The purpose in doing this is to get the KVL equation expressed
using the same unknown variables as the KCL equation, for this is a necessary requirement
for any simultaneous equation solution method. To solve for three unknown currents (I1, I2,
and I3), we must have three equations relating these three currents (not voltages!) together.
