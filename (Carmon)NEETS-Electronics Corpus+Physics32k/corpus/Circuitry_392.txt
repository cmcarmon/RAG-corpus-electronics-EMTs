7.8   The  output  characteristics  of  a  bipolar 
 
transistor  are  shown  in  Fig.  7.55.  If  this 
transistor  is  used  in  an  amplifier  circuit 
 
operating  from  a  12  V  supply  with  a  base 
 
bias current of 60 µA and a load resistor of
 
 
1  kP, determine  the  quiescent  values  of 
and 
collector-emitter  voltage 
 
collector 
current.  Also  determine 
 
the  peak-peak 
output  voltage  produced  when  an  80  µA 
 
 
peak-peak  signal  current  is  applied  to  the 
base of the transistor. 
 
Figure  7.56  shows  a  simple  audio  power 
7.9 
amplifier in which all of the semiconductor 
 
devices  are  silicon  and  all  three  transistors 
 
have  an  hFE  of  100.  If  RV1 is  adjusted  to 
 
produce  4.5  V  at  Test  Point  D,  determine 
 
the  base,  emitter  and  collector  currents  and 
 
voltages for each transistor and the voltages 
 
 
that will appear at Test Points A to C.
