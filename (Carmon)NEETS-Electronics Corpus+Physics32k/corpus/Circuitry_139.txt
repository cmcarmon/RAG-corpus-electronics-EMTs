Kirchhoff’s  Laws  relate  to  the  algebraic  sum  of 
currents  at  a  junction  (or  node) or  voltages  in  a 
network  (or  mesh).  The  term  ‘algebraic’  simply 
indicates that the polarity of each current or voltage 
drop  must  be  taken  into  account  by  giving  it  an 
appropriate sign, either positive (+) or negative (–). 
  Kirchhoff’s  Current  Law  states 
the 
algebraic sum of the currents present at a junction 
(node) in a circuit is zero (see Fig. 3.1).
