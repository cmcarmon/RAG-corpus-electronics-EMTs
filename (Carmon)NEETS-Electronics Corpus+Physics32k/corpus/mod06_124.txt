resistance, abbreviated as Rp. In a properly designed electron tube, there is no physical resistor between
cathode and plate; that is, the electrons do not pass through a resistor in arriving at the plate. You may
have wondered, however, why the variable dc voltage source of figure 1-12 didn’t blow a fuse. Doesn’t
the plate circuit appear to be a short circuit-a circuit without a load to limit the current?
