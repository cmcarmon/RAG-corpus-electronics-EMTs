The polarization unit vector, ^rr, is originally expressed in the
(u, f) coordinates. The locus of the vector, with time, is in
general an ellipse with its major and minor axes oriented along
^uu0 and ^ff0
, respectively, as shown in Figure 6.3. The polarization
vector ^rr(u, f) may be transformed into the new coordinate
system (u0, f0
