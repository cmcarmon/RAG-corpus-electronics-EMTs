In the lower right picture the electrical drive (AC motor) moves a conveyor belt. This type of machine has a nearly constant counter-torque over the whole range of speed. By choosing the incorrect drive (incorrect in size and type) there will be three possible operating points with the necessary working torque. Naturally the operating point with the highest speed is needed because only there will be the highest mechanical power (which is proportional to torque times speed). At the other operating points the majority of the electrical power (proportional only to the torque) will be only converted into heat inside the drive. Despite the bad power balance the drive can also overheat this way.
In the example shown in picture three the desired right operating point with same torque but higher speed (and therefore higher power) cannot be reached alone after starting the drive. The reason is the technically induced decrease of the drive characteristics in the middle of the curve. The speed will reach this area but not increase further. In case of such machines with constant torques a coupling can be used to prevent stopping during start up, it should be rotation speed dependent. (Of course a motor bigger in size would also do, but this is not as economical). With the coupling the counter torque will only be introduced when the load-less drive has reached a speed outside of the unstable working point. Then the drive can safely speed up. Alternatively a drive with an adequate characteristic can be chosen. In the past shunt-motors have been used for this purpose, nowadays asynchronous AC motors are being used or AC motors in combination with a variable frequency drive.
