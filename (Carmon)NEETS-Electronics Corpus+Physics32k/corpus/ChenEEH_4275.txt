In CDMA, each user is assigned a unique code sequence for
encoding an information-bearing signal. The receiver, knowing
the code sequences of the user, decodes a received signal after
reception and recovers the original data. This is possible since
the cross correlations between the code of the desired user and
the codes of the other users are small. Because the bandwidth
of the code signal
is chosen to be much larger than the
bandwidth of the information-bearing signal, the encoding
process enlarges (spreads) the spectrum of the signal and is
therefore also known as spread-spectrum modulation. The
resulting signal is also called a spread-spectrum signal.
