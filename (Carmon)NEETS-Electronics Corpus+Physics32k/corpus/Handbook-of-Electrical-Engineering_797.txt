N(s) and D(s), the numerator
and denominator polynomials of the transfer function. The factorization results in four standard forms. These
are (1) a constant K; (2) a simple s term corresponding to either a zero (if in the numerator) or a pole (if in
the denominator) at the origin; (3) a term such as (st + 1) corresponding to a real valued (nonzero) pole or
zero; and (4) a quadratic term with a possible standard form of [(s/wn)2 + (2z/wn)s + 1] corresponding to a
pair  of  complex  conjugate  poles  or  zeros.  The  Bode  magnitude  and  phase  curves  for  these  possibilities  are
displayed in Figs. 11.3–11.5. Note that both decibel magnitude and phase are plotted semilogarithmically. The
frequency axis is logarithmically scaled so that every tenfold, or decade, change in frequency occurs over an
equal distance. The magnitude axis is given in decibels. Customarily, this axis is marked in 20-dB increments.
Positive decibel magnitudes correspond to ampliﬁcations between input and output that are greater than one
(output  amplitude  larger  than  input).  Negative  decibel  gains  correspond  to  attenuation  between  input  and
output.
