and complex amplitudes. The open-circuit voltage corresponds to the transfer function we have
already found. When we short the terminals, the capacitor no longer has any eﬀect on the circuit,
and the short-circuit current Isc equals Vout
. The equivalent impedance can be found by setting
R
the source to zero, and ﬁnding the impedance using series and parallel combination rules.
In
our case, the resistor and capacitor are in parallel once the voltage source is removed (setting it
to zero amounts to replacing it with a short-circuit). Thus, Zeq = R(cid:107)
.
Consequently, we have
