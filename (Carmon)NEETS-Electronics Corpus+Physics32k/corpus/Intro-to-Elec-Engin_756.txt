8.3.2 The input resistance of a CE ampliﬁer can be
increased at the expense of reduced voltage and
current gains by leaving a portion of the emitter
resistance unbypassed. Consider the CE ampliﬁer
shown in Figure P8.3.2 having an unbypassed
emitter resistance RE1. Assuming for simplicity
that ro → ∞, draw the ac equivalent circuit
for small signals and discuss the effects on input
resistance and voltage and current gains.
