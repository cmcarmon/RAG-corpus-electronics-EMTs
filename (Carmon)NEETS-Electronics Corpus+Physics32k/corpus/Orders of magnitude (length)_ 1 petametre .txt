To help compare different distances this section lists lengths starting at 1015 m (1 Pm or 1,000,000 million km or 6685 astronomical units (AU) or 0.11 light years).
1.0 Pm = 0.105702341 light years
1.9 Pm ± .5 Pm = 12,000 AU = 0.2 light year radius of Cat's Eye Nebula's inner core
4.7 Pm = 30,000 AU = half light year diameter of Bok globule Barnard 68
7.5 Pm – 50,000 AU – Possible outer boundary of Oort cloud (other estimates are 75,000 to 125,000 or even 189,000 AU (1.6, 2, and 3 light years, respectively))
7.7 Pm – 52,000 AU – Aphelion distance of the Great Daylight Comet of 1910
9.5 Pm – 63,241.1 AU – One light year, the distance travelled by light in one year
