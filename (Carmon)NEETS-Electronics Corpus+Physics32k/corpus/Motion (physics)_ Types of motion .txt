Simple harmonic motion – (e.g., that of a pendulum).
Linear motion – motion which follows a straight linear path, and whose displacement is exactly the same as its trajectory.
Reciprocal motion (e.g. vibration)
Random motion (e.g. vibration)
Brownian motion (i.e. the random movement of particles)
Circular motion (e.g. the orbits of planets)
Rotary motion – a motion about a fixed point. (e.g. Ferris wheel).
Curvilinear motion – It is defined as the motion along a curved path that may be planar or in three dimensions.
Rotational motion
Rolling motion - (as of the wheel of a bicycle)
Oscillation - (swinging from side to side)
vibratory motion
Combination (or simultaneous) motions - Combination of two or more above listed motions
Projectile motion - uniform horizontal motion + vertical accelerated motion
Half projectile motion
circular motion (this is a motion that move in a round of body, e.g. the moon and the earth)
Linear motion
