If the entire body is treated as lumped capacitance heat reservoir, with total heat content which is proportional to simple total heat capacity

{\displaystyle Q=CT}

From the definition of heat capacity

comes the relation

{\displaystyle C=dQ/dT}

The solution of this differential equation, by standard methods of integration and substitution of boundary conditions, gives:

then the Newtonian solution is written as:
