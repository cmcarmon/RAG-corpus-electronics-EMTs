An example of a reliable pulse-mode asynchronous sequential logic circuit is shown in Fig. 81.26. While the
inputs  to  asynchronous  fundamental-mode  circuits  are  logic  levels,  the  inputs  to  asynchronous  pulse-mode
circuits are pulses. Pulse-mode circuits have the restriction that the maximum pulse width of any input pulse
must be sufﬁciently narrow such that an input pulse is no longer present when the new present state output
signal becomes available. The purpose of the double-rank circuit in Fig. 81.26 is to ensure that the maximum
pulse width requirement is easily met, since the output is not fed back until the input pulse is removed, i.e.,
goes low or goes to logic 0. The input signals to pulse-mode circuits must also meet the following restrictions:
(a) only one input pulse may be applied at one time, (b) the circuit must be allowed to reach a new stable state
before applying the next input pulse, and (c) the minimum pulse width of an input pulse is determined by the
time it takes to change the slowest ﬂip-ﬂop used in the circuit to a new stable state.
