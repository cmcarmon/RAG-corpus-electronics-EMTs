The  approach  outlined  previously  for  modeling  conventional  measurement  systems  can  be  extended  to  PC-
based instruments with one major difference: PC-based instruments by their nature are digital machines and
perform functions in discrete time. Best performance of PC-based instrument systems must therefore consider
  effects.  Figure 108.7  shows  a  data  acquisition  system  modeled  using  an  ideal  sampler  which
sampled  data
),  of  discrete
instantaneously  samples  a  continuous  signal, 
values that represent the value of the continuous signal at integer multiples of
