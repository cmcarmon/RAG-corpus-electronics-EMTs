In the ionosphere, the rareﬁed air becomes ionized, mainly due to ultraviolet sunlight. The
D-region, usually falling between 50 and 90 km in altitude, will reﬂect waves below 300 kHz or
so, and attenuate higher frequency waves (300 kHz < f < 30 MHz), especially in the daytime.
The D-region mostly disappears at night. The E-region (about 110 km in altitude) reﬂects high
frequencies (3 MHz < f < 30 MHz) during the daytime, and medium frequencies (300 kHz < f
< 3 MHz) at night. The F1-region (about 175 to 250 km in altitude) is distinct from the F2-region
(250 to 400 km in altitude) only during the day; at night they merge. Waves that penetrate the
E-region usually go through the F1-region as well, with some attenuation being the primary effect.
The F2-region provides the main means of long-distance, high-frequency (3 MHz < f < 30 MHz)
communication by wave reﬂection. Sky-wave propagation is illustrated in Figure 15.0.3.
