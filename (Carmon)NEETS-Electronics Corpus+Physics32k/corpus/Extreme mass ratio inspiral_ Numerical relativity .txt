Another approach is to completely solve the equations of motion numerically. The non-linear nature of the theory makes this very challenging, but significant success has been achieved in numerically modelling the final phase of the inspiral of binaries of comparable mass. The large number of cycles of an EMRI make the purely numerical approach prohibitively expensive in terms of computing time.
