One example of the way the polar is used in the design process is the calculation of the power required (PR) curve, which plots the power needed for steady, level flight over the operating speed range. The forces involved are obtained from the coefficients by multiplication with (ρ/2).S V2, where ρ is the density of the atmosphere at the flight altitude, S is the wing area and V is the speed. In level flight, lift equals weight W and thrust equals drag, so

W = (ρ/2).S.V2.CL and

PR = (ρ/2η).S.V3.CD.

The extra factor of V/η, with η the propeller efficiency, in the second equation enters because PR= (required thrust)×V/η. Power rather than thrust is appropriate for a propeller driven aircraft, since it is roughly independent of speed; jet engines produce constant thrust. Since the weight is constant, the first of these equations determines how CL falls with increasing speed. Putting these CL values into the second equation with CD from the drag polar produces the power curve. The low speed region shows a fall in lift induced drag, through a minimum followed by an increase in profile drag at higher speeds. The minimum power required, at a speed of 195 km/h  (121 mph) is about 86 kW (115 hp); 135 kW (181 hp) is required for a maximum speed of 300 km/h (186 mph). Flight at the power minimum will provide maximum endurance; the speed for greatest range is where the tangent to the power curve passes through the origin, about 240 km/h (150 mph).)
If an analytical expression for the polar is available, useful relationships can be developed by differentiation. For example the form above, simplified slightly by putting CL0 = 0, has a maximum CL/CD at CL2 = CD0/K. For a propeller aircraft this is the maximum endurance condition and gives a speed of 185 km/h (115 mph). The corresponding maximum range condition is the maximum of CL3/2/CD, at CL2 = 3.CD0/K, and so the optimum speed is 244 km/h (152 mph). The effects of the approximation CL0 = 0 are less than 5%; of course, with a finite CL0 = 0.1, the analytic and graphical methods give the same results.
