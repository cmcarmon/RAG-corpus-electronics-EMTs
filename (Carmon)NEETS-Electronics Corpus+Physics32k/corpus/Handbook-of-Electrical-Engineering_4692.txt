Another very important class of devices is SAW resonators. Resonators can be used as frequency control elements
in oscillators, as notch ﬁlters, and as narrowband ﬁlters, to name a few. Resonators are typically fabricated on
piezoelectric quartz substrates due to its low TCD which yields temperature-stable devices. A resonator uses
one or two transducers for coupling energy in/out of the device and one or more distributed reﬂector arrays
to store energy in the device. This is analogous to an optical cavity with the distributed reﬂector arrays acting
