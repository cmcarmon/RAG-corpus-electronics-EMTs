winding currents causes the motor to start. The auxiliary winding is disconnected by a centrifugal
switch or relay when the motor comes up to about 75% of the synchronous speed. The torqueâ€“speed
characteristic of the split-phase motor is of the form shown in Figure 13.2.12(c). A split-phase
motor can develop a higher starting torque if a series resistance is inserted in the starting auxiliary
winding. A similar effect can be obtained by inserting a series inductive reactance in the main
winding; this additional reactance is short-circuited when the motor builds up speed.
