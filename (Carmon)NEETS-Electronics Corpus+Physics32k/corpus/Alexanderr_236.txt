The  op  amp  is  an  electronic  device  consisting  of  a  complex
arrangement of resistors, transistors, capacitors, and diodes. A full dis-
cussion of what is inside the op amp is beyond the scope of this book.
It will sufÔ¨Åce to treat the op amp as a circuit building block and sim-
ply study what takes place at its terminals.
