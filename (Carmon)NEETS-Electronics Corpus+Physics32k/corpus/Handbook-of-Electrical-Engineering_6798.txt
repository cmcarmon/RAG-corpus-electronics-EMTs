Other Services
For alternate billing services, the SCP is essentially designed to perform two functions: carrier identiﬁcation
and billing authorization. For 800 Service, the SCP provides carrier identiﬁcation and address translation. These
basic functions of authorization, address translation and carrier identiﬁcation can be used again and again in
many different ways. For example, the intelligent network has been used to support private virtual networks
(PVNs). PVNs make use of the public telephone network but, by means of software control, appear to have
the characteristics of private networks. A PVN serves a closed-user group, and a caller requires authorization
to  gain  access  to  the  network.  This  screening  function  on  originating  calls  uses  an  authorization  function.
Second, a PVN may offer an abbreviated dialing plan, for example, four-digit dialing. In this instance, the SCP
performs an address translation function, converting a four-digit number to a ten-digit POTS number. There
may also be a customer-speciﬁed routing information function which involves selecting from a hierarchy of
facilities; this can be accomplished through use of the SCP carrier identiﬁcation function.
