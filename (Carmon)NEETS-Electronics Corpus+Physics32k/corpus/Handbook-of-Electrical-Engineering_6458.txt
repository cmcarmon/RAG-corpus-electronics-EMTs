That  is  not  to  say  the  spread  signal  cannot  be  detected,  however,  merely  that  it  is  more  difﬁcult  for  an
adversary to learn of the transmission. Indeed, there are many forms of so-called intercept receivers that are
speciﬁcally designed to accomplish this very task. By way of example, probably the best known and simplest
to implement is a radiometer, which is just a device that measures the total power present in the received signal.
