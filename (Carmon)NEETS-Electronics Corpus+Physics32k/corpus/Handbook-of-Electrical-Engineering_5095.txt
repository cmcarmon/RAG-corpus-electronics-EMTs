Polar Kerr Effect
The polar Kerr effect takes place when the magnetization is perpendicular to the plane of the material. A pair
of  orthogonal  linearly  polarized  reﬂected  light  modes  will  be  induced  and  the  total  reﬂected  light  becomes
elliptically polarized. The orientation of the major axis of the elliptic polarization of the reﬂected light is the
same for both TE (Ei^) or TM (Ei//) linearly polarized incident lights since r12 = r21.
Longitudinal or Meridional Kerr Effect
The longitudinal Kerr effect takes place when the magnetization is in the plane of the material and parallel to
the plane of incidence. Again, an elliptically polarized reﬂected light beam will be induced, but the orientation
of the major axis of the elliptic polarization of the reﬂected light is opposite to each other for TE (Ei^) and TM
(Ei//) linearly polarized incident lights since r12 = –r21.
Transverse or Equatorial Kerr Effect
This  effect  is  also  known  as  the  equatorial  Kerr  effect.  The  magnetization  in  this  case  is  in  the  plane  of  the
material  and  perpendicular  to  the  plane  of  incidence.  The  reﬂected  light  does  not  undergo  a  change  in  its
polarization  since  r12  =  r21  =  0.  However,  the  intensity  of  the  TM  (Er//)  reﬂected  light  will  be  changed  if  the
direction  of  the  magnetic  ﬁeld  is  suddenly  reversed.  For  TE  (Er^)  reﬂected  light,  this  modulation  effect  is  at
least two orders of magnitude smaller and is usually ignored.
