Before proceeding further, it is important to distinguish between the model
of a two-terminal element and the element itself. The models, or element laws,
presented in this section are idealized. They describe a simplified behavior
of the real elements (a voltage source for a battery, for instance). From this
point forward, we will focus on circuits comprising only ideal elements, and
make only occasional reference to reality. Nonetheless, it is important to realize
in practice that the result of a circuit analysis is only as good as the models
on which the analysis is based. Part of any discrepancy between theory and
experiment may be a result of the fact that the elements do not really behave
as the elements laws predict.
