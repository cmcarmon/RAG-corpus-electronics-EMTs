When an AC voltage is applied to the resistive load, 
the AC currentâ€™s amplitude and direction vary in the 
same manner as those of the applied voltage. When 
the applied voltage changes polarity, the current also 
changes. They are said to be in phase. Figure 23-2 
shows the in-phase relationship that exists between 
the current and the applied voltage in a pure resis-
tive  circuit. The current and voltage waveforms pass 
through 0 and maximum values at the same time. 
However, the two waveforms do not have the same 
peak amplitudes because they represent different 
quantities, measured in different units.
