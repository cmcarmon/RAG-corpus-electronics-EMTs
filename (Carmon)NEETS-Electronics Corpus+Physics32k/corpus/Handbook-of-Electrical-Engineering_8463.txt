In digital computers the radices encountered are 2, 4, 10, and 16, with 2 being the most commonly used one.
The digit set xi can be redundant and nonredundant. If the number of different values xi can assume is nx £
r, then we have a nonredundant digit set. Otherwise, if nx > r, we have a redundant digit set. Use of the redundant
digit set has its advantages in efﬁcient implementation of algorithms (multiplication and division in particular).
Other  number  representations  of  interest  are  nonweighted  number  systems,  where  the  relative  position  of
the digit does not affect the weight so that the appropriate interchange of any two digits will not change the
value x. The best example of such a number system is the residue number system (RNS).
