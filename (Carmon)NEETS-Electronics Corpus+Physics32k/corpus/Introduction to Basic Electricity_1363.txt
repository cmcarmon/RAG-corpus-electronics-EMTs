An atom that has the same number of electrons and 
protons is identified as an electrically balanced atom. 
A balanced atom that receives one or more electrons is 
no longer balanced. It is said to be negatively charged 
and is called a negative	ion. A balanced atom that 
loses one or more electrons is said to be positively 
charged and is called a positive	ion. The process of 
gaining or losing electrons is called ionization. Ion-
ization is significant in current flow.
