The new Vulcan launch vehicle currently being developed by United Launch Alliance will initially fly with an upgraded variant of the Common Centaur stage flown on Atlas V known as Centaur V, before later upgrading to the new "Advanced Cryogenic Evolved Stage", which will include the Integrated Vehicle Fluids technology to allow long on-orbit life of the upper stage measured in weeks rather than hours.
