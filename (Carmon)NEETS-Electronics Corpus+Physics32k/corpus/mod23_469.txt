The SCSI interface uses one 50-pin ribbon cable to connect the hard disk drive(s) to the controller 
card mounted in the host computer. Some computer manufacturers include the SCSI electronics in their 
motherboards and do away with a separate controller card altogether. This interface got its big break 
when Apple Computer Corporation used the SCSI as its hard disk drive interface in its MacIntosh 
computers.
