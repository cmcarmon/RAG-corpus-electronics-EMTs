Creating a text ﬁle in a computer involves the use of a program called a text editor. Similar
to a word processor, a text editor allows you to type text and record what you’ve typed in the
form of a ﬁle stored on the computer’s hard disk. Text editors lack the formatting ability of
word processors (no italic, bold, or underlined characters), and this is a good thing, since
programs such as SPICE wouldn’t know what to do with this extra information. If we want
to create a plain-text ﬁle, with absolutely nothing recorded except the keyboard characters we
select, a text editor is the tool to use.
