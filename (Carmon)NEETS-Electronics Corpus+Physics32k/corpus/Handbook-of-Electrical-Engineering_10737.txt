Reliability engineering is a vast ﬁeld and it has grown signiﬁcantly during the past ﬁve decades (since World
War II). The two major approaches to reliability assessment and prediction are (1) traditional methods based
on  probabilistic  assessment  of  ﬁeld  data  and  (2)  methods  based  on  the  analysis  of  failure  mechanisms  and
physics of failure. The latter is more accurate, but is difﬁcult and time consuming to implement. The ﬁrst one,
in spite of its many ﬂaws, continues to be in use. Some of the many areas encompassing reliability engineering
are reliability allocation and optimization, reliability growth and modeling, reliability testing including accel-
erated testing, data analysis and graphical techniques, quality control and acceptance sampling, maintenance
engineering,  repairable  system  modeling  and  analysis,  software  reliability,  system  safety  analysis,  Bayesian
analysis, reliability management, simulation and Monte Carlo techniques, Failure Modes, Effects and Criticality
Analysis (FMECA), and economic aspects of reliability, to mention a few.
