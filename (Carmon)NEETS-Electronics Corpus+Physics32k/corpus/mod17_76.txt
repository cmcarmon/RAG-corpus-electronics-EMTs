Partial reference designations are used to save space on diagrams. For example, refer back to figure 
1-6. Partial reference designations are placed near the parts on subassembly A15, and a note indicates the 
reference designation prefix is added. Capacitor C3 on subassembly A15 has the complete reference 
designation 2A7A15C3.
