GRID BIAS is a steady, direct voltage that is placed at some point in the external circuit between the
grid and the cathode. It may be in the cathode leg or the grid leg as shown in figure 1-17. It is always in
series with the input signal voltage. In each of the circuits in figure 1-17, Ecc makes the grid negative with
respect to the cathode because of the negative terminal being connected toward the grid and the positive
terminal being connected toward the cathode. With identical components, each circuit would provide the
same bias.
