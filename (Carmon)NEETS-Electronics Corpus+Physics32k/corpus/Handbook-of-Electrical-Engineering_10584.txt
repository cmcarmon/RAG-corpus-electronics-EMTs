Color Quality of Light. 
In general, for seeing tasks industrial areas, there appears to be no effect upon visual
acuity by variation in color of light. However, where color discrimination or color matching is a part of the
work process, such as in the printing and textile industries, the color of light should be carefully selected. Color
always has an effect on the appearance of the workplace and on the complexions of people. The illuminating
system and the decorative scheme should be properly coordinated.
