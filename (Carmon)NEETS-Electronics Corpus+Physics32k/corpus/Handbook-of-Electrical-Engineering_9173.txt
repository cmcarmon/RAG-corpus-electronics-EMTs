OpenCard Framework
OpenCard Framework (OCF) [6] objective is to offer to the programmer a transparency with regard to smart
card  operating  systems,  card  terminals,  and  card  issuers.  To  achieve  this,  OCF  has  deﬁned  a  provision  of
functions to support installation, removal, enumeration, selection of applications on the card and of functions
to perform name resolution for data ﬁles on the card. Several mechanisms allow a user to develop an application
without knowing where the card issuer placed his applications. OpenCard Framework based its architecture
on two main parts: the CardTerminal layer and the CardService layer.
