The gravitational influence of Planet Nine would explain five peculiarities of the Solar System:
the clustering of the orbits of extreme trans-Neptunian objects (eTNOs);
the high perihelia of objects like Sedna that are detached from Neptune's influence;
the high inclinations of eTNOs with orbits roughly perpendicular to the orbits of the eight known planets,
high inclination trans-Neptunian objects with semi-major axis less than 100 AU,
and the obliquity, or tilt, of the Sun's axis relative to the planets' orbits.
While other mechanisms have been offered for many of these peculiarities, the gravitational influence of Planet Nine is the only one that explains all five. The gravity of Planet Nine also excites the inclinations of scattering objects, which in numerical simulations leaves the short-period comets with a broader inclination distribution than is observed.
