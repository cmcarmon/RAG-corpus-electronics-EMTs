8 K/W for a ceramic package or a specially designed plastic chip package. Carefully designed chip packages can
attain even lower values of Rjc, but the conductive thermal resistances at the interfaces between materials, and
especially  along  the  chip  surfaces  where  the  heat  ï¬‚uxes  are  highest,  can  typically  reach  1  K/W  for  epoxied
interfaces and impose a lower bound on the internal package resistance.
