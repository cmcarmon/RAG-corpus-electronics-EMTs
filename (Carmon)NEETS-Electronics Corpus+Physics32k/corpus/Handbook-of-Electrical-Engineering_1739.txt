In practice, these projection integrals may be measured using a variety of physical techniques. In transmission
tomography, l
T photons are emitted into an object under test. A detector then counts the number of photons,
l(u,t),  which  pass  through  the  object  without  being  absorbed.  Collimators  are  used  to  ensure  the  detected
energy passes straight through the object along the desired path. Since the attenuation of energy as it passes
through the object is exponentially related to the integral of the objectâ€™s density, the projection integral may
be computed from the formula
