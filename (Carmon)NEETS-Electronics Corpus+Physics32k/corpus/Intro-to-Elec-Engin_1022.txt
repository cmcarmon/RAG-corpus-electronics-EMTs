We mentioned earlier that the greater ease of storing energy in magnetic Ô¨Åelds largely accounts
for the common use of electromagnetic devices for electromechanical energy conversion. In a
magnetic circuit containing an air-gap region, the energy stored in the air-gap space is several
times greater than that stored in the iron portion, even though the volume of the air gap is only a
small fraction of that of the iron.
