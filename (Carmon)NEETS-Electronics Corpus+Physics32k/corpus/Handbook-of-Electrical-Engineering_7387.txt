In a moving or rotating application, stationary magnets can be placed so that they generate electricity in a
moving coil and are used to provide automatic power generation. If this method is not feasible, a stationary
coil  can  be  placed  in  the  vicinity  of  the  transmitter  and  fed  electrical  energy  at  a  high  frequency,  so  that  its
ﬁeld can easily couple into a moving coil in almost any environment. The stationary coil ring may be large,
even encompassing a whole room; usually only one turn of wire is necessary. The stationary coil may also be
made extremely small, 1⁄4 to 1⁄2 in. in diameter, and coupled to the end of a rotating shaft. These power supplies
and coil conﬁgurations are standard available units.
