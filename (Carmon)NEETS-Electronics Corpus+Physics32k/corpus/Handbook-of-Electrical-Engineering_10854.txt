Graphical Displays
Engineers are, in general, more comfortable with pictures than with text as a means of communicating their
ideas. Hence, the wide availability of graphical displays is of prime importance to many areas of engineering
computing. Indeed, the development of computer graphics has been the means by which certain control systems
design  techniques,  such  as  multivariable  control  systems  analysis,  have  been  made  practicable.  Computer
graphics have also been instrumental in providing improvements in human-machine interfaces such as sche-
matic systems input and direct manipulation interfaces with windows, icons, pull-down menus, and pop-up
dialog boxes. Further improvements in user interfacing techniques such as 
 will continue to rely on
developments in display technology.
