Note that for matrix multiplication, the error coverage of
the hybrid test is as high as 97% for a dynamic range of 2 and is
80% for a dynamic range of 15; this is a much higher error
coverage than the technique of forward-error propagation
used with the ﬂoating point checksum test in work by Roy-
Chowdhury and Banerjee (1993). For LU decomposition, error
coverage of 90% is obtained for a dynamic range of 7, which is
similar to Roy-Chowdhury and Banerjee’s results.
