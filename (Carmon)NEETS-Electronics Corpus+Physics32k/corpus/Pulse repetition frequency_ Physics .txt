PRF is crucial to perform measurements for certain physics phenomenon.
For example, a tachometer may use a strobe light with an adjustable PRF to measure rotational velocity. The PRF for the strobe light is adjusted upward from a low value until the rotating object appears to stand still. The PRF of the tachometer would then match the speed of the rotating object.
Other types of measurements involve distance using the delay time for reflected echo pulses from light, microwaves, and sound transmissions.
