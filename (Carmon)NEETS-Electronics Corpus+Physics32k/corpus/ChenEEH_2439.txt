The dipole does not radiate in the vertical directions (u ¼ 0, p)
and produces maximum radiation perpendicular to the current
(u ¼ p=2) with uniform variation in the azimuth. There is a
sin u factor for variation of the radiation ﬁelds in the elevation
in proportion to the projection of the input current in the
particular direction. The magnetic ﬁeld HH is in the ^ff direction
and, thus, revolves around the wire in analogy to a magneto-
static ﬁeld, due to a linear current. The electric ﬁeld EE and,
accordingly, the polarization vector of the dipole antenna, are in
the ^uu direction. Once the far-ﬁeld expressions are known, then
the power density Pd and power per unit solid angle pd of the
radiation can be derived using the theory of Das (2004):
