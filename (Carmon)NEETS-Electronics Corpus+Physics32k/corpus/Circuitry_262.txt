Example 5.7 
 
A transistor 
linear  amplifier 
arrangement.  The  transistor  has  small  and  large 
signal  current  gains  of  200  and  175,  respectively, 
and  bias  is  arranged  so  that  the  static  value  of 
collector current is 10 mA. Determine the value of 
base  bias  current  and 
the  change  of  output 
(collector) current that  would result from a 10 ÂµA 
change in input (base) current.
