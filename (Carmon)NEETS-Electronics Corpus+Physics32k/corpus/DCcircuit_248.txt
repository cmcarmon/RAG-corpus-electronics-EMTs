As an instructor of industrial electronics, I spend a full week with my students reviewing
the theoretical and practical aspects of electrical safety. The same textbooks I found lacking
in technical clarity I also found lacking in coverage of electrical safety, hence the creation of
this chapter. Its placement after the Ô¨Årst two chapters is intentional: in order for the con-
cepts of electrical safety to make the most sense, some foundational knowledge of electricity is
necessary.
