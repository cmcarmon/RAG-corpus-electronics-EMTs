The certainty factor approach is simple, easy to understand,
and efﬁcient to run; it provides a means of estimating belief
that is natural to a domain expert. Its combination methods
ensure locality, detachment, and modularity (Steﬁk, 1995).
This means that adding or deleting rules does not require
rebuilding the entire certainty model.
