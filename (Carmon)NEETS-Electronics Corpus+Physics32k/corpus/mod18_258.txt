The width of the pulse generated by an artificial transmission line depends on the time required for a
voltage wave to travel from the input end to the output end of the line and back. Therefore, we can say the
pulse width depends on the velocity of propagation along the line (determined by the inductances and
capacitances of each section of the line) and the number of line sections (the length of the line).
