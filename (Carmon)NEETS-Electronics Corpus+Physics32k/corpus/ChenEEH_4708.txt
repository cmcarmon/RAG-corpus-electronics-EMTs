Now, the goal is to formulate an expression for the Volterra
kernels of the controller G in the frequency domain in terms of
the kernels of the plant, given above, and those of the desired
closed-loop map, T . The development follows that given in Al-
Baiyat Sain (1986). Similarly to the Volterra operator Pi[u(t )],
deÔ¨Åne Volterra operators associated with the maps T and M
such that:
