It also becomes necessary for every source to mathematically
describe the trafﬁc characteristics of the trafﬁc it will be send-
ing. For example, every source can describe its trafﬁc ﬂow
characteristics using a trafﬁc descriptor that contains the
peak rate, average rate, and maximum burst size (Kurose and
Ross, 2001). This can be speciﬁed in terms of leaky bucket
parameters, like the bucket size b, and the token rate r. In this
case, the maximum burst size will be equal to the size of the
bucket (i.e., b peak rate will be rT þ b, where T is the time
taken to empty the whole bucket, and the average rate over
time t is rt þ b).
