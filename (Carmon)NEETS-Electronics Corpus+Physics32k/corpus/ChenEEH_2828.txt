Recently, several researchers have conducted theoretical inves-
tigations of the use of ultrawideband microwave pulses for
early stage breast cancer detection. In principle, this technique
could detect smaller tumors over larger regions of the breast, a
detection that is not currently possible using X-ray mammog-
raphy. This technique would also help prevent a patientâ€™s
exposure to potentially hazardous ionizing radiation. In this
proposed technique, an array of small antennas would be
placed on the surface of the breast to emit and then receive a
short electromagnetic pulse lasting less than 100 ps. Signal-
processing techniques would then be applied to the received
pulses at each antenna element to form the breast image. In
work to date, FDTD modeling has provided simulated test
data and allowed optimization of the imaging algorithms. As
shown in Figure 9.17, these simulations indicate promise for
imaging small, deeply embedded malignant tumors in the
presence of the background clutter due to complicated sur-
rounding normal tissues.
