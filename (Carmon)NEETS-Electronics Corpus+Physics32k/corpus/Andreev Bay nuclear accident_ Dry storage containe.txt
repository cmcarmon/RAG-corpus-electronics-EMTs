The dry storage containers consist of three steel underground blocks: "3A", "2A", and "2B": 18 m (59 ft) in diameter, 1,000 m3 (35,000 cu ft) each. Initially, the containers were designed as filtration structures for radioactive water from building #5, but after the 1982 accident, they were refitted to serve as dry storage for nuclear waste from building #5, as well as from nuclear submarines. Each container contains cells made of vertical steel pipes. The pipes are placed a set distance from each other in order to avoid starting an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction. Each pipe is 4 m (13 ft) long, 400 mm (16 in) in diameter, and 250–270 mm (9.8–10.6 in) space between the pipes is filled with concrete. The "3A" container has 900 cells (for 900 drums), whereas containers "2A" and "2B" have 1,200 cells each. The drums were loaded using the KPM-40 crane.
After the refitting project was approved, the 50 cm (20 in) concrete covers over the containers were broken in order to load the drums. Since the containers remained uncovered, loading was conducted in outdoor conditions, where precipitation fell inside unobstructed. The drums were placed into the cells, displacing water, which immediately turned into radioactive vapour, due to the heat emitted from the fuel assemblies, and wind scattered it over the entire territory of the base. In his book "Andreev Nuclear Bay", A. N. Safonov writes, citing data, that the bottoms of the containers were not covered in steel and allowed groundwater to seep through. During winters, the groundwater inside the cells froze, deforming their steel covers.
