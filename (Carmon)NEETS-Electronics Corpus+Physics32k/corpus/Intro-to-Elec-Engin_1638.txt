Once the mathematical modeling of physical systems is done, while satisfying equations of
electric networks and mechanical systems, as well as linearizing nonlinear systems whenever
possible, feedback control systems can be analyzed by using various techniques and methods:
transfer function approach, root locus techniques, state-variable analysis, time-domain analysis,
and frequency-domain analysis. Although the primary purpose of the feedback is to reduce the
error between the reference input and the system output, feedback also has effects on such system
performance characteristics as stability, bandwidth, overall gain, impedance, transient response,
frequency response, effect of noise, and sensitivity, as we shall see later.
