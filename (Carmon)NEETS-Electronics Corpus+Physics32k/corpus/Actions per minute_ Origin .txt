The term APM originates from StarCraft which was popularised after the development of a large number of community tools allowing observers of game matches to view player resources and actions per minute which was used as a metric in determining a player's skill. After the release of StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty, many of these metrics were built into the game's interface, including APM which further popularised the term's usage and served to increase the competitiveness of the game.
