There are four common types of rotary actuators:
Physical gauges, in which the needle is attached directly to the value being measured; for example, a mechanical pressure gauge
Analog volt meters or d'Arsonval movements, which consist of a coil and a permanent magnet
Stepper motors, which move in one-notch increments or steps
Air-core motors, as described below.
