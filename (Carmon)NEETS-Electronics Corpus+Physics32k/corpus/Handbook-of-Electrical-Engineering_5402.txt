Ongoing  research  in  TPV  converters  is  advancing  on  two  fronts.  First,  materials  are  in  development  with
even  lower  bandgaps  in  the  GaxIn1–xAsySb1–y  system  and  in  GaxIn1–xAs. As  shown  in  Figure 60.20,  maximum
power densities should be achieved for devices at about 0.5 eV or less. The availability of devices over a narrow
range  of  bandgaps  opens  the  possibility  of  further  system  efﬁciency  gains  through  use  of  cascade  multiple-
junction converters. A two-cell stack with bandgaps of 0.7 eV and 0.53 eV should be current-matched for a
black-body emitter operating at about 1500°C. The use of such tandem cells will likely place an even greater
premium on achieving exceedingly uniform temperature proﬁle over the emitter area.
