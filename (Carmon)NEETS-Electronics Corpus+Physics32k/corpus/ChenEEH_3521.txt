on classiﬁcation according to support. Support denotes the
subset of the domain where the signal is nonzero (i.e., the
extent of
the independent variable or ‘‘time-axis’’ where
the signal is nonzero). The nature of support bears a relation
to types of convergence regions of the z-transform or Laplace
transform of a signal as seen later.
