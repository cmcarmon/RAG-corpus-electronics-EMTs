On the afternoon of 26 May 1910 Pluviôse was cruising off Calais when she was involved in a collision with the packet boat Pas de Calais. Pluviôse sank with the loss of all hands, 27 men. The vessel was later raised and repaired, though she was not returned to front-line service, being disarmed and used for compression tests.
Her captain at the time of the accident Maurice Callot, was later honoured by having a submarine named after him.
Pluviôse was stricken in 1919 and sold for scrap in 1925.
