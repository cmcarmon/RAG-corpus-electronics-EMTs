The angular velocity of a particle is measured relative to a point, called the origin. As shown in the diagram (with angles ɸ and θ in radians), if a line is drawn from the origin (O) to the particle (P), then the velocity (v) of the particle has a component along the radius (radial component, v‖) and a component perpendicular to the radius (cross-radial component, v⊥). If there is no radial component, then the particle moves tangent to a circle centered about the origin. On the other hand, if there is no cross-radial component, then the particle moves tangent to a straight line that passes through the origin.
A radial motion produces no change in the direction of the particle relative to the origin, so, for the purpose of finding the angular velocity, the radial component can be ignored. Therefore, only the cross-radial (tangential) component of the velocity contributes to the angular velocity.
In two dimensions, the angular velocity ω is given by

This is related to the cross-radial velocity by:

In two dimensions, the angular velocity is a single number with an orientation but no vectorial direction. In other words, in two dimensions, it is a pseudoscalar, a quantity that changes its sign under a parity inversion (for example if one of the axes is inverted or if axes are swapped). The direction of angular velocity is taken, by convention, to be positive if the position vector turns counterclockwise, and negative if the position vector turns clockwise. If the parity is inverted, but the orientation of the angular displacement is not, then the sign of the angular velocity changes.
