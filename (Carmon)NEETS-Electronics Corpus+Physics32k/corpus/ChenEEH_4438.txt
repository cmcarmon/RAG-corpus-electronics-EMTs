In equation 4.3, x(k) ¼ x(kT ), k is an integer, and T is a
ﬁxed sample period. If F , Gu, and Gv are time invariant over
the interval (kT , (k þ 1)T ], then Fx(k), Gu, Gv, and the stat-
istics of the discrete-time Gaussian white noise process vd(k)
can be determined so that the solutions to equation 4.1 at the
sample times t ¼ kT have the same ﬁrst- and second-order
statistics as the solution of equation 4.3. Both n(k) and vd(k)
are discrete-time Gaussian white noise sequences with covar-
iance matrices deﬁned by:
