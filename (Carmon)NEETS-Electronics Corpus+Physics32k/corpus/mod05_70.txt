Eddy currents, just like any other electrical currents, are affected by the resistance of the material in 
which the currents flow. The resistance of any material is inversely proportional to its cross-sectional 
area. Figure 1-11, view A, shows the eddy currents induced in an armature core that is a solid piece of 
soft iron. Figure 1-11, view B, shows a soft iron core of the same size, but made up of several small 
pieces insulated from each other. This process is called lamination. The currents in each piece of the 
laminated core are considerably less than in the solid core because the resistance of the pieces is much 
higher. (Resistance is inversely proportional to cross-sectional area.) The currents in the individual pieces 
of the laminated core are so small that the sum of the individual currents is much less than the total of 
eddy currents in the solid iron core.
