When the 10-microvolt original signal and the 5-microvolt reflected signal are out of phase with each
other, the signal strength at the receiving antenna will decrease to 5 microvolts. If we want to maintain
our original 1,000-microvolt output signal, the voltage gain of the amplifier must be increased as follows:
