It  is  also  important  to  note  that  the  Electronics  Industries  Association  is  monitoring  several  standard
committees for CRTs and that proposals for standards are submitted by the industry and by laboratories such
as the National Information Display Laboratory (see Further Information). These standards are following the
evolution of measurement techniques. The adoption of these standards by the industry will make it possible
for display users to choose their equipment according to criteria uniformly approved around the world.
