You may wonder why the frequency response is important. Why doesn't an amplifier designed to 
amplify a signal of 1000 Hz work just as well at 1000 MHz? The answer is that the components of the 
amplifier respond differently at different frequencies. The amplifying device (electron tube, transistor, 
magnetic amplifier, etc.) itself will have frequency limitations and respond in different ways as the 
frequency changes. Capacitors and inductors in the circuit will change their reactance as the frequency 
changes. Even the slight amounts of capacitance and inductance between the circuit wiring and other 
components (interelectrode capacitance and self-inductance) can become significant at high frequencies. 
Since the response of components varies with the frequency, the components of an amplifier are selected 
to amplify a certain range or band of frequencies.
