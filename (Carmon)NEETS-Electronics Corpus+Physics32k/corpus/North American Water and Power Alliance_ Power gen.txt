The project would generate a vast amount of electricity from a number of hydroelectric and nuclear power facilities (the latter of which would be required to power the multiple pumping stations needed to move the water across the continent). The issue of electricity generation has created some controversy, with some commentators such as Marc Reisner arguing that the plan would be a net consumer of energy, while others estimate a net gain of 60 to 80 million kilowatts after meeting the needs for pumping.
