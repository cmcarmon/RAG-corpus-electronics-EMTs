Fiber optic connection losses may affect system performance. Poor fiber end preparation and poor
fiber alignment are the main causes of coupling loss. Another source of coupling loss is differences in
optical properties between the connected fibers. If the connected fibers have different optical properties,
such as different numerical apertures, core and cladding diameters, and refractive index profiles, then
coupling losses may increase.
