A lacing shuttle on which the cord can be wound keeps the cord from fouling during the lacing 
operation. A shuttle similar to the one shown in figure 2-40 can easily be made from aluminum, brass, 
fiber, or plastic scrap. Rough edges of the material used for the shuttle should be filed smooth to prevent 
injury to the operator and damage to the cord. To fill the shuttle for a single lace, measure the cord, cut it, 
and wind it on the shuttle. For double lace, proceed as before, except double the length of the cord before 
you wind it on the shuttle. For double lace, start both ends of the cord or tape on the shuttle in order to 
leave a loop for starting the lace. This procedure is explained later in the chapter.
