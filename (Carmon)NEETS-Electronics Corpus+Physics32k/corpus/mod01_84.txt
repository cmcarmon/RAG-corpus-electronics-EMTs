In this study of electricity and electronics, the association of matter and electricity is important. Since
every electronic device is constructed of parts made from ordinary matter, the effects of electricity on
matter must be well understood. As a means of accomplishing this, all elements of which matter is made
may be placed into one of three categories: CONDUCTORS, SEMICONDUCTORS, and
INSULATORS, depending on their ability to conduct an electric current. CONDUCTORS are elements
which conduct electricity very readily, INSULATORS have an extremely high resistance to the flow of
electricity. All matter between these two extremes may be called SEMICONDUCTORS.
