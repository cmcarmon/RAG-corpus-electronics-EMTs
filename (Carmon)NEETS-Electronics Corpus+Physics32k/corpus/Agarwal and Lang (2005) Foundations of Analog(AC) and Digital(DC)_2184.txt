This positive voltage at the non-inverting input terminal will result in a positive
voltage difference at the Op Amp input port (between v
), and conse-
quently, the output will continue to be driven to the positive saturation voltage,
namely VS. The equivalent circuit is as shown in Figure 15.32. The capacitor C
begins to charge up towards VS through the resistor R3. Since no current flows
into the v
+ =
VSR1/(R1 + R2), resulting in an effective negative voltage across the Op Amp
+
input port, namely across the v
terminals. The Op Amp amplifies this
negative voltage difference at its input to a large negative voltage at its output.
Since the negative voltage at the output is fed back to the non-inverting terminal
by the voltage divider formed by R1 and R2, the non-inverting terminal voltage
becomes negative, which makes the voltage difference at the Op Amp input
even more negative, and which in turn makes the output voltage fall even more.
This positive feedback process continues until the output reaches the negative
saturation voltage −VS. At this point, we have
+ = −VSR1
R1 + R2
