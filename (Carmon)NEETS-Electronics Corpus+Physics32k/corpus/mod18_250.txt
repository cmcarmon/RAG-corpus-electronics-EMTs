Many different kinds of components are used in radar modulators. The power supply generally
produces a high-voltage output, either alternating or direct current. The charging impedance may be a
resistor or an inductor. The storage element is generally a capacitor, an artificial transmission line, or a
pulse-forming network. The modulator switch is usually a thyratron.
