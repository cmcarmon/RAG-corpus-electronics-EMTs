One  implementation  of  modal  propagators  for  numerical  modeling  is  that  due  to  Waterman  [in  Mittra,
1973], whose approach uses the extended boundary condition (EBC) whereby the required ﬁeld behavior is
satisﬁed away from the boundary surface on which the sources are located. This procedure, widely known as
the T-matrix approach, has evidently been more widely used in optics and acoustics than in electromagnetics.
In what amounts to a reciprocal application of EBC, the sources can be removed from the boundary surface
on which the ﬁeld-boundary conditions are applied. These modal techniques seem to offer some computational
advantages  for  certain  kinds  of  problems  and  might  be  regarded  as  using  entire-domain  basis  and  testing
functions but nevertheless lead to linear systems of equations whose numerical solution is required. Fourier
transform solution techniques might also be included in this category since they do involve modal expansions,
but that is a specialized area that we do not pursue further here.
