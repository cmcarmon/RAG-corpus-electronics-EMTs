Vehicle systems or entire vehicles may be proof-tested. As failure of an aircraft structure or substructure may be catastrophic, demonstration of designs or of in-service units is performed via proof testing. Failure of sail rigging is no longer as catastrophic, but may still lead to damage, injury and loss of vehicle functions.
