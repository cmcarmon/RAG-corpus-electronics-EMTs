In 1959 Robert Pound and Glen A. Rebka measured the very slight gravitational red shift in the frequency of light emitted at a lower height, where Earth's gravitational field is relatively more intense. The results were within 10% of the predictions of general relativity. In 1964, Pound and J. L. Snider measured a result within 1% of the value predicted by gravitational time dilation. (See Poundâ€“Rebka experiment)
In 2010 gravitational time dilation was measured at the earth's surface with a height difference of only one meter, using optical atomic clocks.
