Since the circuit in Figure 3.12, with I = 0, is the same as the circuit in
Figure 2.46, the analysis of the two circuits (with I = 0) using the basic and
the node methods should yield the same results. Accordingly, the reader might
want to compare the values for v3 and i3 obtained here, with those obtained in
Equations 2.135 and 2.131.
