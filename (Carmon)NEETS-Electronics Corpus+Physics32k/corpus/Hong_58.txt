The  source  and  load  model  is  particularly  useful  when  the  design  of  either  the 
source or load circuit is fixed and a circuit is required to be the corresponding source or 
load circuit. For example, if the output of a voltage amplifier behaves as a voltage source 
with a source resistance of 500Ω, the input resistance of the next circuit, being the load 
impedance,  should  be  significantly  greater  than  500Ω  in  order  to  prevent  the  source 
voltage from being attenuated.
