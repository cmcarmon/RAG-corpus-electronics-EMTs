. The pixel values in a
particular image may occupy only a small region of gray level distribution. For instance, the pixels in an image
may only take on values between 0 and 63, when they could nominally take on values between 0 and 255. This
is sometimes caused by the way the image was digitized and/or by the type of transducer used. When this image
is examined on a CRT display the contrast looks washed out. A simple point operation that multiplies each
pixel value in the image by four will increase the apparent contrast in the image; the new image now has gray
values between 0 and 252. This operation is shown in Fig. 17.4. Possibly the most widely used point operation
. In this point operation all the pixels in the image with a particular gray
in medical imaging is

undergoes contrast enhancement and then pseudo-coloring.
