While an existing converging T-DAG will ultimately be
found by Conv_T-DAG, it will be time-efﬁcient if some suit-
able ‘‘cost’’ measure can be used to determine which transi-
tions are more likely to be successful so that fewer T-DAGs
are searched and backtracked. A good cost measure will con-
sider both the ‘‘magnitude’’ of bumpings (total
length of
bumped nets) and the likelihood of convergence of these
bumpings.
