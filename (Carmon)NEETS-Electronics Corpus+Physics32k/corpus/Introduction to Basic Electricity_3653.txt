To summarize the differences in rectifiers: The ad-
vantages of the half-wave rectifier are its simplicity and 
low cost. It requires one diode and a transformer. It is 
not very efficient, because only half of the input signal 
is used. It is also restricted to low-current applications.
The full-wave rectifier is more efficient than the 
half-wave rectifier. It operates on both alternations of 
the sine wave. The higher ripple frequency of the full-
wave rectifier is easier to filter. A disadvantage is that 
it requires a center-tapped transformer. Its output volt-
age is lower than that of a half-wave rectifier for the 
same transformer because of the center tap.
