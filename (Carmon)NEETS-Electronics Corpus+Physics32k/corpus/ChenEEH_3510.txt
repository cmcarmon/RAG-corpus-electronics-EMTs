Notions of signals and systems are encountered in a wide
variety of disciplines. Signal processing formalizes these
notions in a uniÔ¨Åed framework. It enables us to deal with
diverse phenomena whose behavior is captured in variations
of functions that characterize the phenomena. Signals are an
abstraction for representing these variations. The signal may
represent amplitude changes in speech or audio, concentration
of a solute, biologically generated voltages, temperature inside
an engine, pressure in a urinary bladder, noise in a communi-
cation receiver, and other such variables.
