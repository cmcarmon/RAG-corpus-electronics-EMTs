In the Couette flow, instead of the translational motion of one of the plate, an oscillation of one plane will be executed. If we have a bottom wall at rest at



y
=
0


{\displaystyle y=0}
and the upper wall at



y
=
h


{\displaystyle y=h}
is executing an oscillatory motion with velocity



U
cos
⁡
ω
t


{\displaystyle U\cos \omega t}
, then the velocity field is given by




u
=
U

ℜ

{



sin
⁡
k
y


sin
⁡
k
h



}

,


where


k
=



1
+
i

ω
ν



.


{\displaystyle u=U\ \Re \left\{{\frac {\sin ky}{\sin kh}}\right\},\quad {\text{where}}\quad k={\frac {1+i}{2}}{\sqrt {\frac {\omega }{\nu }}}.}

The frictional force per unit area on the moving plane is



−
μ
U
ℜ
{
k
cot
⁡
k
h
}


{\displaystyle -\mu U\Re \{k\cot kh\}}
and on the fixed plane is



μ
U

{

k

}


{\displaystyle \mu U\Re \{k\csc kh\}}
.
