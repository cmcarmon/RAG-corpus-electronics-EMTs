When dealing with fluids or solids, an expression in terms of the temperature and pressure is usually more useful:




d
U
=

(


C

−
α

V

)

d
T
+

(


β

T


p
−
α
T

)

V
d
p



{\displaystyle dU=\left(C_{p}-\alpha pV\right)dT+\left(\beta _{T}p-\alpha T\right)Vdp\,}

where it is assumed that the heat capacity at constant pressure is related to the heat capacity at constant volume according to:

{\displaystyle C_{p}=C_{V}+VT{\frac {\alpha ^{2}}{\beta _{T}}}\,}
