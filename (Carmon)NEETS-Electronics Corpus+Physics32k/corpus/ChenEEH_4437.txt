The d(t) is the Dirac delta function. The power spectral
density matrices Q(t) and R(t ) are symmetric positive deﬁnite
for all t.
State estimation may be desired for two reasons. First, when
the measurement matrix H 6¼ I , then the state is not directly
measured; however, knowledge of the full state may be desir-
able (e.g., for control). Second, even if H ¼ I, it may be
beneﬁcial to ﬁlter the measurements to decrease the effects of
the measurement noise. Filtering can be considered as a state
estimation process.
