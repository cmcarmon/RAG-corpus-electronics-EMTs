An intuitive example of nonzero clock skew being used to
improve the performance and reliability of a fully synchronous
digital circuit is shown in Figure 4.6. Two pairs of sequentially
adjacent ﬂip-ﬂops, R1?R2 and R2?R3, are shown in Figure
4.6, where both zero skew and nonzero skew situations are
illustrated in Figures 4.6(A) and 4.6(B), respectively. Note that
the local data paths made up of the registers R1 and R2 and of
R2 and R3, respectively, are connected in series (R2 being
common to both R1?R2 and R2?R3). In each of the Fig-
