The minimum cost dispatch occurs when the incremental cost of all the generators is equal. The cost functions
of the generators are nonlinear and discontinuous. For the equal marginal cost algorithm to work it is necessary
for  them  to  be  convex.  These  incremental  cost  curves  are  often  represented  as  monotonically  increasing
piecewise-linear  functions.  A  binary  search  for  the  optimal  marginal  cost  is  conducted  by  summing  all  the
generation at a certain marginal cost and comparing it with the total power demand. If the demand is higher,
a higher marginal cost is needed, and vice versa. This algorithm produces the ideal setpoints for all the generators
for that particular demand, and this calculation is done every few minutes as the demand changes.
