This  technology  allows  (1)  2–3  speed  increase  (vis-à-vis  conventional  thermal  transfer  printing)  because
printhead  thermal  time  constants  are  much  less  of  a  factor,  (2)  very  high-resolution  printing  (up  to  40
pixels/mm), and (3) printing on ofﬁce-quality bond papers. Also, already deposited ink can be selectively lifted
off the paper by reducing the printhead power and using a fresh ribbon area. Offsetting these advantages is the
fact that the ribbon is more complex and costly than conventional transfer ribbons.
