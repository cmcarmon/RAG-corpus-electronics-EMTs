analysis when a given voltage or current phasor is taken as the reference. Since a phasor diagram is
a frozen picture at one instant of time, giving the relative locations of various phasors involved, and
the whole diagram of phasors is assumed to be rotating counterclockwise at a constant frequency,
different phasors may be made to be the reference simply by rotating the entire phasor diagram
in either the clockwise or the counterclockwise direction.
