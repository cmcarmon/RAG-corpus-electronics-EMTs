where  K  is  a  constant  representing  the  ﬁrst  factor,  l  is  magnetic  ﬂux,  and  n  is  rotor  speed.  The  foregoing
equation  provides  some  insights  into  the  voltage  control  of  dc  generators.  Among  the  three  terms,  it  is
impractical to modify K, which is determined by the machine design. Changing n over a wide range may not
be  feasible  since  this  is  limited  by  what  drives  the  rotor.  Changing  the  magnetic  ﬂux  l  can  be  done  if  the
permanent magnet is replaced by an electromagnet, and this is how the voltage control is done in practice. The
control of l is made possible by adjusting the current fed to this electromagnet. Figure 66.9 shows the modiﬁed
design of the simple dc generator. The stator winding is called the ﬁeld winding, which produces excitation for
the machine. The current in the ﬁeld winding is adjusted by means of a variable resistor connected in series
with this winding. It is also possible to use two ﬁeld windings in order to have more ﬂexibility in control.
