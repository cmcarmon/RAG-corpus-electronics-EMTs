For other amplifiers, the desired frequency response is different. For example, perhaps the amplifier
should have high gain at two frequencies and low gain for all other frequencies. The frequency-response
curve for this type of amplifier would show two "peaks." In other amplifiers the frequency-response curve
will have one peak indicating high gain at one frequency and lower gain at all others.
