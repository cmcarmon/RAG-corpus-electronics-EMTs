Nikola Tesla’s work in 1888 on electric machines made evident the advantages of polyphase
over single-phase systems. The ﬁrst three-phase line (12 km at 2.3 kV) in the United States
became operational in California during 1893. The three-phase induction motor conceived by
Tesla became the workhorse of the industry.
