In quantum mechanics, particles also behave as waves with complex phases. The phase velocity is equal to the product of the frequency multiplied by the wavelength.
By the de Broglie hypothesis, we see that

{\displaystyle v_{\mathrm {p} }={\frac {\omega }{k}}={\frac {E/\hbar }{p/\hbar }}={\frac {E}{p}}.}

Using relativistic relations for energy and momentum, we have

where E is the total energy of the particle (i.e. rest energy plus kinetic energy in the kinematic sense), p the momentum,



γ


{\displaystyle \gamma }
the Lorentz factor, c the speed of light, and β the speed as a fraction of c. The variable v can either be taken to be the speed of the particle or the group velocity of the corresponding matter wave. Since the particle speed



v

c


{\displaystyle v<c}
for any particle that has mass (according to special relativity), the phase velocity of matter waves always exceeds c, i.e.





v

{\displaystyle v_{\mathrm {p} }>c,\,}

and as we can see, it approaches c when the particle speed is in the relativistic range. The superluminal phase velocity does not violate special relativity, because phase propagation carries no energy. See the article on Dispersion (optics) for details.
