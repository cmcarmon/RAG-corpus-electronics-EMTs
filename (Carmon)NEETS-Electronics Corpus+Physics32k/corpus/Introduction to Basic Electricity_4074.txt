Figure 40-1 shows three basic waveforms that are rep-
resented by the time domain concept. The three 
waveforms shown are sine wave, square wave, and 
sawtooth wave. Although the three waveforms are dif-
ferent, they all have the same period of frequency. By 
using various electronic circuits, these waveforms can 
be changed from one shape to another.
