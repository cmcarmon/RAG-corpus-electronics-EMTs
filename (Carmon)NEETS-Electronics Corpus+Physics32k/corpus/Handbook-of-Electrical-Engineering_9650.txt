As  computer  technologies  come  into  widespread  use,  users  begin  to  desire  standardization.  Standardization
allows a user to know that a program written to a standard will work without concern for which vendor supplies
the programming environment. Operating systems are no exception to this general rule, and there are several
standards,  that  apply.  Porting  software  from  one  system  to
standards,  both  industry  standards  and 
another, often an expensive proposition, becomes a trivial task.
