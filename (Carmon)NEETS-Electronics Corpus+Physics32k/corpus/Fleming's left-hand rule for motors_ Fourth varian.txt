The F(Thumb) represents the direction of Force of the conductor
The B(Forefinger) represents the direction of the Magnetic field
The I(Centre finger) represents the direction of the Current.
This uses the conventional symbolic parameters of F (for Lorentz force), B (for magnetic flux density) and I (for electric current), and attributing them in that order (FBI) respectively to the thumb, first finger and second finger.
The thumb is the force, F
The first finger is the magnetic flux density, B
The second finger is the electric current, I.
Of course, if the mnemonic is taught (and remembered) with a different arrangement of the parameters to the fingers, it could end up as a mnemonic that also reverses the roles of the two hands (instead of the standard left hand for motors, right hand for generators). These variants are catalogued more fully on the FBI mnemonics page.
