Extrinsic Magnetic Properties
Extrinsic magnetic properties are those properties that depend not only on the shape and size of the sample,
but  also  on  the  shape  and  size  of  the  magnetic  constituents  of  the  sample.  For  example,  if  we  measure  the
hysteresis loop like the one shown in Fig. 36.6 on a disk-shaped sample punched from a magnetic recording
tape, the result will depend not only on the diameter and thickness of the disk coating but also on the distribution
of shapes and sizes of the magnetic particles within the disk. They display hysteresis individually and collectively.
For  a  soft  magnetic  material,  i.e.,  one  that  might  be  used  to  make  the  laminations  of  a  transformer,  the
dependence of magnetization, M, on the applied magnetic Ô¨Åeld, H, is also complex. Having once left a point
described by the coordinates (H1, M1), it is not immediately clear how one might return to that point.
