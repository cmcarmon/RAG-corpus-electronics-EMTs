internal names. An external name is a string of characters
having some meaning to users; an internal name is a binary
code used by the system to locate the object. The user desig-
nates external names for objects, and the system generates the
mapping from external to internal names automatically. A
hierarchy arises because a directory can include among its
entries the names of subordinate directories.
