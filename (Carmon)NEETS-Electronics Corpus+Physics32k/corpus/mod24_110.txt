As the angle of incidence (� 1) becomes larger, the angle of refraction (� 2) approaches 90 degrees.
At this point, no refraction is possible. The light ray is totally reflected back into the glass medium. No
light escapes into the air. This condition is called total internal reflection. The angle at which total internal
reflection occurs is called the critical angle of incidence. The critical angle of incidence (� ) is shown in
figure 2-8. At any angle of incidence (� 1) greater than the critical angle, light is totally reflected back into
the glass medium. The critical angle of incidence is determined by using Snell's Law. The critical angle is
given by:
