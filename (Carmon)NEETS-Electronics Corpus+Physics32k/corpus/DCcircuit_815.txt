We have a problem, in that the connections and connecting wires between Ra and Rx possess
resistance as well, and this stray resistance may be substantial compared to the low resistances
of Ra and Rx. These stray resistances will drop substantial voltage, given the high current
through them, and thus will affect the null detectorâ€™s indication and thus the balance of the
bridge:
