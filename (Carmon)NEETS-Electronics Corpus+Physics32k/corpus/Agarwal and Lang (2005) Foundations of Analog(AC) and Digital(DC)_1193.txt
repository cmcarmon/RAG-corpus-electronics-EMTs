(cid:1) This chapter also introduced the small-signal circuit model. The small-
signal circuit facilitates small-signal analysis by creating a circuit that is
representative of the original large-signal circuit and involves only its small-
signal variables. The small-signal circuit can be derived from the original
circuit by executing the following procedure:
