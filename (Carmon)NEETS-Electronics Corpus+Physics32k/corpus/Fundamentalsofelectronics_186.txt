What we have discovered is that source(s) equaling a complex exponential of the same frequency forces
all circuit variables to be complex exponentials of the same frequency. Consequently, the ratio of voltage to
current for each element equals the ratio of their complex amplitudes, which depends only on the sourceâ€™s
frequency and element values.
