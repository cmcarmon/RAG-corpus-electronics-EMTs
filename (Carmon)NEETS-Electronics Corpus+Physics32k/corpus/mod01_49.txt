The origin of the modern technical and electronic Navy stretches back to the beginning of naval
history, when the first navies were no more than small fleets of wooden ships, using wind-filled sails and
manned oars. The need for technicians then was restricted to a navigator and semiskilled seamen who
could handle the sails.
