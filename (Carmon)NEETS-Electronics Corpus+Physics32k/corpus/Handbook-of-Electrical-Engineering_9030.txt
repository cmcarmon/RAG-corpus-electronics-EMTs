Continuous Ink-Jet Printing. With this technology, ink is continuously jetted from a small-diameter nozzle
under  pressure  (see  Fig. 89.28). Although  the  resultant  jet  stream  will  naturally  break  into  small  drops,  this
phenomenon is assisted and stabilized by the inclusion of a piezoelectric perturbation transducer, driven at the
desired drop rate. Lord Rayleigh was the Ô¨Årst to determine that the dimensionless instability factor
