A balanced discriminator with the corresponding frequency characteristics is depicted in
Figure 15.2.15. The rising half of the frequency characteristic of a tuned circuit, shown in Figure
15.2.15(b), may not have a wide enough linear region. In order to obtain a linear characteristic
over a wider range of frequencies [see Figure 15.2.15(d)], usually two circuits tuned at two
frequencies f 1 and f 2 [with the frequency response shown in Figure 15.2.15(c)] are used in a
balanced discriminator [Figure 15.2.15(a)].
