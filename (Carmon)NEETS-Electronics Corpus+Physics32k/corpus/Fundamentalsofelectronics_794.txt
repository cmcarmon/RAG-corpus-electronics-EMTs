Figure 6.6: The AM coherent receiver along with the spectra of key signals is shown for the case of a
triangular-shaped signal spectrum. The dashed line indicates the white noise level. Note that the ﬁlters’
characteristics — cutoﬀ frequency and center frequency for the bandpass ﬁlter — must be match to the
modulation and message parameters.
