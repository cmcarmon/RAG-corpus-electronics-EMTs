Now, suppose that a body moves with constant velocity v through the fluid, which is at rest infinitely far away. Then the velocity field of the fluid has to follow the body, so it is of the form u(x, t) = u(x − v t, 0), where x is the spatial coordinate vector, and thus:







∂

u



∂
t



+

(


v

⋅

∇


)


u

=

0

.


{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial {\boldsymbol {u}}}{\partial t}}+\left({\boldsymbol {v}}\cdot {\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\right){\boldsymbol {u}}={\boldsymbol {0}}.}

Since u = ∇φ, this can be integrated with respect to x:

.


{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \varphi }{\partial t}}=-{\boldsymbol {v}}\cdot {\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\varphi +R(t)=-{\boldsymbol {v}}\cdot {\boldsymbol {u}}+R(t).}

The force F that the fluid exerts on the body is given by the surface integral





F

∫

A


p

S


{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {F}}=-\int _{A}p\,{\boldsymbol {n}}\;\mathrm {d} S}

where A denotes the body surface and n the normal vector on the body surface. But it follows from (2) that

thus

with the contribution of R(t) to the integral being equal to zero.
At this point, it becomes more convenient to work in the vector components. The kth component of this equation reads

{\displaystyle F_{k}=\rho \int _{A}\sum _{i}({\tfrac {1}{2}}u_{i}^{2}-u_{i}v_{i})n_{k}\,\mathrm {d} S.\qquad (3)}

Let V be the volume occupied by the fluid. The divergence theorem says that

The right-hand side is an integral over an infinite volume, so this needs some justification, which can be provided by appealing to potential theory to show that the velocity u must fall off as r−3 – corresponding to a dipole potential field in case of a three-dimensional body of finite extent – where r is the distance to the centre of the body. The integrand in the volume integral can be rewritten as follows:

where first equality (1) and then the incompressibility of the flow are used. Substituting this back into the volume integral and another application of the divergence theorem again. This yields

Substituting this in (3), we find that

{\displaystyle F_{k}=\rho \int _{A}\sum _{i}(u_{k}u_{i}n_{i}-v_{i}u_{i}n_{k})\,\mathrm {d} S.}

The fluid cannot penetrate the body and thus n · u = n · v on the body surface. So




∑

i



n

v

=

∑

{\displaystyle \sum _{i}n_{i}\,v_{i}=\sum _{i}n_{i}\,u_{i}}

{\displaystyle F_{k}=\rho \int _{A}\sum _{i}(u_{k}v_{i}n_{i}-v_{i}u_{i}n_{k})\,\mathrm {d} S.}

Finally, the drag is the force in the direction in which the body moves, so





v

⋅

F

=

∑

k



v

0.


{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {v}}\cdot {\boldsymbol {F}}=\sum _{k}v_{k}F_{k}=0.}

Hence the drag vanishes. This is d'Alembert's paradox.
