impedance  divided  by  output  impedance)  and 
voltage  gain.    The  input  and  output  ports  are 
specified  as  two  pairs  of  nodes.  Note  that,  for 
complex circuits it can take some time to carry out 
this analysis and the analysis may fail if there is an 
excessive number of poles or zeros.
