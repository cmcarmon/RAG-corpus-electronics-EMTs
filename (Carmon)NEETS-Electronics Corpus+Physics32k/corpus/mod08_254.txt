RF TRANSFORMERS, specially designed for use with rf, are used to correct the problem of
excessive hysteresis loss in the transformer of an rf amplifier. The windings of rf transformers are wound
onto a tube of nonmagnetic material and the core is either powdered iron or air. These types of cores also
reduce eddy-current loss.
