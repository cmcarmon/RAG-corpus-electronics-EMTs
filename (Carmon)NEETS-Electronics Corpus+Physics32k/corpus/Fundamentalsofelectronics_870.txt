6.23 Subtleties of Coding31
In the Huﬀman code, the bit sequences that represent individual symbols can have diﬀering lengths so the
bitstream index m does not increase in lock step with the symbol-valued signal’s index n. To capture how
often bits must be transmitted to keep up with the source’s production of symbols, we can only compute
averages. If our source code averages B (A) bits/symbol and symbols are produced at a rate R, the average
bit rate equals B (A) R, and this quantity determines the bit interval duration T .
