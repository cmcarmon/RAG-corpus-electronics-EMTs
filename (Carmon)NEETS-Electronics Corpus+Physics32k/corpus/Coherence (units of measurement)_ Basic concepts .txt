In SI, which is a coherent system, the unit of power is the watt which is defined as one joule per second. In the US customary system of measurement, which is non-coherent, the unit of power is the horsepower which is defined as 550 foot-pounds per second (the pound in this context being the pound-force); similarly the gallon is not equal to a cubic yard (nor is it the cube of any length unit).
