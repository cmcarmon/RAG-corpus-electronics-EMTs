FIGURE 47.7 Electrical network analysis for a SAW transducer. IG and RG represent the generator source and impedance,
LT  is  a  tuning  inductor,  CH  and  LH  are  due  to  the  package  capacitance  and  bond  wire,  respectively,  and  RP  represents  a
parasitic resistance due to the electrode transducer resistance. The entire network, including the frequency-dependent SAW
network, is solved to yield the single-port transfer function.
