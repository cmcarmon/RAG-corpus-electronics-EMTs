The beam travel time in the longitudinal direction can be derived as follows: Light is sent from the source and propagates with the speed of light



c


{\displaystyle c}
in the aether. It passes through the half-silvered mirror at the origin at



T
=
0


{\displaystyle T=0}
. The reflecting mirror is at that moment at distance



L


{\displaystyle L}
(the length of the interferometer arm) and is moving with velocity



v


{\displaystyle v}
. The beam hits the mirror at time




T

{\displaystyle T_{1}}
and thus travels the distance



c

T

{\displaystyle cT_{1}}
. At this time, the mirror has traveled the distance



v

{\displaystyle vT_{1}}
. Thus

{\displaystyle cT_{1}=L+vT_{1}}
and consequently the travel time




T

=

/

(

)


{\displaystyle T_{1}=L/(c-v)}
. The same consideration applies to the backward journey, with the sign of

{\displaystyle v}
reversed, resulting in

{\displaystyle cT_{2}=L-vT_{2}}
and




T

{\displaystyle T_{2}=L/(c+v)}
. The total travel time

{\displaystyle T_{l}={\frac {L}{c-v}}+{\frac {L}{c+v}}={\frac {2L}{c}}{\frac {1}{1-{\frac {v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}\approx {\frac {2L}{c}}\left(1+{\frac {v^{2}}{c^{2}}}\right)}

Michelson obtained this expression correctly in 1881, however, in transverse direction he obtained the incorrect expression





T

t


=



2
L

c


,


{\displaystyle T_{t}={\frac {2L}{c}},}

because he overlooked that the aether wind also affects the transverse beam travel time. This was corrected by Alfred Potier (1882) and Lorentz (1886). The derivation in the transverse direction can be given as follows (analoguous to the derivation of time dilation using a light clock): The beam is propagating at the speed of light



c


{\displaystyle c}
and hits the mirror at time




T

3




{\displaystyle T_{3}}
, traveling the distance



c

T

3




{\displaystyle cT_{3}}
. At the same time, the mirror has traveled the distance



v

T

3




{\displaystyle vT_{3}}
in the x direction. So in order to hit the mirror, the travel path of the beam is



L


{\displaystyle L}
in the y direction (assuming equal-length arms) and



v

T

3




{\displaystyle vT_{3}}
in the x direction. This inclined travel path follows from the transformation from the interferometer rest frame to the aether rest frame. Therefore, the Pythagorean theorem gives the actual beam travel distance of







L

(

)

{\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\sqrt {L^{2}+\left(vT_{3}\right)^{2}}}}
. Thus

{\displaystyle \scriptstyle cT_{3}={\sqrt {L^{2}+\left(vT_{3}\right)^{2}}}}
and consequently the travel time

{\displaystyle \scriptstyle T_{3}=L/{\sqrt {c^{2}-v^{2}}}}

Dividing

{\displaystyle n={\frac {\Delta _{1}-\Delta _{2}}{\lambda }}\approx {\frac {2Lv^{2}}{\lambda c^{2}}}.}

Since L ≈ 11 meters and λ≈500 nanometers, the expected fringe shift was n ≈0.44. So the result would be a delay in one of the light beams that could be detected when the beams were recombined through interference. Any slight change in the spent time would then be observed as a shift in the positions of the interference fringes. The negative result led Michelson to the conclusion that there is no measurable aether drift.
