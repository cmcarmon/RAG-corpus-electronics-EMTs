Exercise 5.5
(Solution on p. 191.)
To gain a better appreciation of aliasing, sketch the spectrum of a sampled square wave. For
simplicity consider only the spectral repetitions centered at − 1
. Let the sampling interval
Ts
Ts be 1; consider two values for the square wave’s period: 3.5 and 4. Note in particular where the
spectral lines go as the period decreases; some will move to the left and some to the right. What
property characterizes the ones going the same direction?
