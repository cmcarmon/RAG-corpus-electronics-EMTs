The most well-known analog simulator is Berkeley 
SPice. SPICE is industry-standard nomenclature for 
electronic circuit simulation and is the most advanced 
in the world. Probably the best-known digital simula-
tors are those based on Verilog, a hardware descrip-
tion language and VHdl, Very High-Speed Integrated 
Circuit Hardware Description Language.
