Two basic methods are used to measure radar receiver sensitivity. One is the PULSE METHOD, in 
which a pulse of measured amplitude and width is coupled to the receiver. In the second method, you use 
an fm generator to vary the signal generator output frequency across the receiver bandwidth. This latter 
method ensures the test signal is within the bandpass of the receiver.
