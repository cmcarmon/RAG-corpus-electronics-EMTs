Fiber
All  ﬁbers  used  for  long-distance  communications  are  made  of  silica  glass  and  allow  only  a  single  mode  of
propagation. The silica is doped with other materials to produce the required refractive index variations for
the ﬁber core and cladding. The important ﬁber characteristics that limit system performance are its loss and
its bandwidth. The loss limits the length of the link and the bandwidth limits the data rate.
