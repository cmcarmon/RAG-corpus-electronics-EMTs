VECTOR ANALYSIS OF AN AM WAVE.â€”You studied earlier in this chapter that the 
modulation envelope results when the instantaneous sums of the carrier and sideband voltages are plotted 
with respect to time. An attempt to add these three voltages, point-by-point, would prove to be a huge 
task. The same end result can be obtained by using a rotating vector to represent each of the three
