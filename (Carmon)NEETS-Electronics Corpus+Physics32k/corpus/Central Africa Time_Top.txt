Central Africa Time, or CAT, is a time zone used in central and southern Africa. Central Africa Time is two hours ahead of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC+02:00), which is the same as the adjacent South Africa Standard Time and Eastern European Time (although the latter area uses Eastern European Summer Time (UTC+3) most of the year)
As this time zone is in the equatorial and tropical regions, there is little change in day length throughout the year, and so daylight saving time is not observed.
Central Africa Time is used by the following countries:
Burundi
Botswana
Egypt (observes Eastern European Time)
Democratic Republic of the Congo (eastern)
Libya
Malawi
Mozambique
Namibia
Rwanda
Sudan
Zambia
Zimbabwe
The following countries use South African Standard Time instead of Central Africa Time:
Lesotho
South Africa
Swaziland
