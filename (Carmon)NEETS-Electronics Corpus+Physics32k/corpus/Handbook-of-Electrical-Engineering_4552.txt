matrices increases sensitivity of the results to roundoff errors. This is especially the case when the direct matrix is
not well conditioned. It is therefore advisable to perform some sensitivity analyses to determine the direct-matrix
condition number and to ascertain the possible need for performing some of the computations in double precision.
