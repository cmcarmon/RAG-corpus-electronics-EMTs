*12.4.8 A two-pole rotating machine with a singly ex-
cited magnetic ﬁeld system as its stator and a
rotor (that carries no coil) has a stator-coil in-
ductance that can be approximated by L(θ ) =
(0.02 − 0.04 cos 2θ − 0.03 cos 4θ ) H, where
θ is the angle between the stator-pole axis and
the rotor axis. A current of 5 A (rms) at 60 Hz is
passed through the coil, and the rotor is driven at
