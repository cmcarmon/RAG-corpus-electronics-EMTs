Motorcycle tire changers are less sophisticated than passenger cars and light truck or heavy-duty tire changers because they deal with smaller and lighter tires and wheels. Motorcycle tire changers mainly provide a simple bead loosening system and rim clamps powered manually. Certain motorcycle tire changers can accommodate wheel diameters as small as 10" and wheels at least 1-1/2" wide. In addition, small atv wheels and tires are used on motorcycle tire changers.
