As shown in this example (Example 6.3), no commas are placed in the bitstream, but you can unambiguously
decode the sequence of symbols from the bitstream. Huﬀman showed that his (maximally eﬃcient) code had
the preﬁx property: No code for a symbol began another symbol’s code. Once you have the preﬁx property,
the bitstream is partially self-synchronizing: Once the receiver knows where the bitstream starts, we can
assign a unique and correct symbol sequence to the bitstream.
