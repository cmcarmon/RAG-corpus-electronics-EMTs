The structure for the single substrate ac plasma displays is shown in Fig. 83.31 [Shinoda et al., 1993]. Note
that the front and back substrates each have simple one dimensional features. Since the two substrate structures
are positioned orthogonally, there is no critical alignment between the two substrates because the pixels will
automatically occur wherever the orthogonal electrodes intersect. This allows for straightforward manufacture
of large panels.
