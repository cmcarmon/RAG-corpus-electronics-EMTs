The formation of ions and ionic bonds from neutral atoms or molecules (or vice versa) in-
volves the transfer of electrons. That transfer of electrons can be harnessed to generate an
electric current.A device constructed to do just this is called a voltaic cell, or cell for short, usu-
ally consisting of two metal electrodes immersed in a chemical mixture (called an electrolyte)
designed to facilitate such an electrochemical (oxidation/reduction) reaction:
