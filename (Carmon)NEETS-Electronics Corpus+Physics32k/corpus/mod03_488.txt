switch will only remain in the momentary position as long as the actuator is held in that position. As soon
as you let go of the actuator, the switch will return to a non-momentary position. The starter switch on an
automobile is an example of a momentary switch. As soon as you release the switch, it no longer applies
power to the starter.
