During the last decade, a spectrum of standards in digital video and multimedia has emerged for different
applications. These standards include: the ISO JPEG for still images [1]; ITU-T H.261 for video conferencing
from 64 kilobits per second (kbps) to 2 megabits per second (Mbps) [2]; ITU-T H.263 for PSTN-based video
telephony [3]; ISO MPEG-1 for CD-ROM and storage at VHS quality [4]; the ISO MPEG-2 standard for digital
television [5]; and the recently completed ISO/MPEG-4 international standard for multimedia representation
and integration [6]. Two new ISO standards are under development to address the next-generation still image
coding (JPEG-2000) and content-based multimedia information description (MPEG-7). Several special issues
of IEEE journals have been devoted to summarizing recent advances in digital image, video compression, and
advanced television in terms of standards, algorithms, implementations, and applications [7â€“11].
