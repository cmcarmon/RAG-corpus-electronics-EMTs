The saturation intensity IS is defined as the input intensity at which the gain of the optical amplifier drops to exactly half of the small-signal gain. We can compute the saturation intensity as

{\displaystyle I_{S}={h\nu  \over \sigma (\nu )\cdot \tau _{S}}}

where
h is Planck's constant, and
τS is the saturation time constant, which depends on the spontaneous emission lifetimes of the various transitions between the energy levels related to the amplification.




ν


{\displaystyle \nu }
is the frequency in Hz
