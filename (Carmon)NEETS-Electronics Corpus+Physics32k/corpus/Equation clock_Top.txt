An equation clock is a mechanical clock which includes a mechanism that simulates the equation of time, so that the user can read or calculate solar time, as would be shown by a sundial. The first accurate clocks, controlled by pendulums, were patented by Christiaan Huyghens in 1657. For the next few decades, people were still accustomed to using sundials, and wanted to be able to use clocks to find solar time. Equation clocks were invented to fill this need.
Early equation clocks have a pointer that moves to show the equation of time on a dial or scale. The clock itself runs at constant speed. The user calculates solar time by adding the equation of time to the clock reading. Later equation clocks, made in the 18th Century, perform the compensation automatically, so the clock directly shows solar time. Some of them also show mean time, which is often called "clock time".
