Controller design uses a nominal plant model. The error
between the nominal model and the real plant arises primarily
from two sources: unmodeled dynamics and parametric un-
certainties. If the controller design does not take these errors
into account,
it cannot guarantee the performance of the
closed-loop system with the real plant nor guarantee that
the closed-loop system will be stable. Therefore, it is important
to design controllers that will maintain closed-loop stability in
spite of erroneous design models and uncertainties in param-
eter values. Controllers so designed are said to impart stability
robustness to the closed-loop system.
