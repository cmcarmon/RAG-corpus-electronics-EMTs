All  of  the  previous  calculations  assume  that  the 
heatsink is subject to natural convection. Increasing 
the  airflow  across  the  surface  of  the  heatsink  can 
dramatically  increase  the  amount  of  radiated  and 
consequently  it  will  also  significantly  reduce  the 
effective thermal resistance of the heatsink.
