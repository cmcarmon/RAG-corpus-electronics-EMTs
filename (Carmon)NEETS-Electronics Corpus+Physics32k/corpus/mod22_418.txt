With synchronous transmission, only a single set of start and stop message characters is needed per 
block of data, thus allowing more characters to be transmitted per second. As you can see, synchronous 
transmission is more efficient and faster. However, it has the disadvantage of requiring a more complex 
and expensive modem than does asynchronous transmission.
