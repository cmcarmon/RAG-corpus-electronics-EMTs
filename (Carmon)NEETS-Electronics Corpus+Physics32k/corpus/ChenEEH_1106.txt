Several foundries exist speciﬁcally or primarily for the pro-
duction of MEMS. The fact that the design rules in MEMS are
roughly two generations behind those in ICs is signiﬁcant. This
enables MEMS foundries to buy used equipment from the
microelectronics industry. Mass production of many MEMS
is done using 100- and 150-mm wafers. Several companies and
organizations in the United States and abroad offer fabrication
services for MEMS that are somewhat analogous to what
MOSIS does
include BFGoodrich
