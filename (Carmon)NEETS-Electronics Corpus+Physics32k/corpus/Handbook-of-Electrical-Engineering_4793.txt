The current semiconductor technology is tending toward dry processing. Thus, in spite of the advantages
of  the  Sol-Gel  method,  other  methods  using  physical  vapor  deposition  (PVD)  are  being  investigated.  These
methods use energetic beams or plasma to move the constituent materials from the target to the heated substrate.
