Power, as a function of time, is the rate at which work is done, so can be expressed by this equation:




P
=



d
W


d
t





{\displaystyle P={\frac {dW}{dt}}}

where P is power, W is work, and t is time. Because work is a force F applied over a distance r,




W
=


F


⋅


r




{\displaystyle W={\mathbf {F}}\cdot {\mathbf {r}}}

for a constant force, power can be rewritten as:




P
=



d
W


d
t

{\displaystyle P={\frac {dW}{dt}}={\frac {d}{dt}}\left({\mathbf {F}}\cdot {\mathbf {r}}\right)={\mathbf {F}}\cdot {\frac {d{\mathbf {r}}}{dt}}={\mathbf {F}}\cdot {\mathbf {v}}}
