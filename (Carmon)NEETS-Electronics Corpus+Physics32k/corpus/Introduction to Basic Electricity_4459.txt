The  basic  flip-flop  is  the  Rs  flip-flop.  It  is 
formed by two cross-coupled NOR or NAND gates 
( Figure  44-1). The RS flip-flop has two outputs, Q and 
Q, and two controlling inputs, R (Reset) and S (Set). 
The outputs are always opposite or complementary: If 
Q 5 1, then Q 5 0, and vice-versa.
