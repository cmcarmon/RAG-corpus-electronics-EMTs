Usually  comprises  four  strain  gauges  attached  to  a  metal  frame.  This 
assembly  is  then  loaded  and  the  analogue  output  voltage  produced  is 
proportional to the weight of the load. 
Permanent  magnet  seismic  mass  suspended  by  springs  within  a 
cylindrical  coil.  The  frequency  and  amplitude  of  the  analogue  output 
voltage are respectively proportional to the frequency and amplitude of 
vibration.
