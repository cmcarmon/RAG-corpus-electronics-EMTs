In CMOS technology this situation is much different given that CMOS gate has strong dependency not only
on fan-in but on fan-out as well. This limitation takes away much of the advantages gained by using the CLA
scheme.  However,  by  clever  optimization  of  the  critical  path  and  appropriate  use  of  dynamic  logic  the  CLA
scheme can still be advantageous, especially for the adders of a larger size.
