Limitations upon Miniaturization
A major factor in the success of the MOSFET has been its compatibility with processing useful down to very
small dimensions. Today channel lengths (source-to-drain spacings) of 0.5 mm are manufacturable, and further
reduction to 0.1 mm has been achieved for limited numbers of devices in test circuits such as ring oscillators.
In this section some of the limits that must be considered in miniaturization are outlined [Brews, 1990].
