The diagram of a GRAMME-RING armature is shown in figure 1-12, view A. Each coil is 
connected to two commutator segments as shown. One end of coil 1goes to segment A, and the other end 
of coil 1 goes to segment B. One end of coil 2 goes to segment C, and the other end of coil 2 goes to 
segment B. The rest of the coils are connected in a like manner, in series, around the armature. To 
complete the series arrangement, coil 8 connects to segment A. Therefore, each coil is in series with every 
other coil.
