twisting type of load can be experienced by line insulators
during line construction. Vibrational loads are imposed on
insulators due to conductor vibration and movement. Shock
(or impact) loading is also possible during natural events like
earthquakes, ice-shedding, or man-made events, like vehicular
impact on poles and vandalism (gun shots).
