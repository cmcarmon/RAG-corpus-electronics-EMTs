Find the average value of the voltage vO. Problem 10.11 may give you a hint. Explain
It may help to consider the waveform vS to be made up of a DC

voltage V/2 and a symmetrical square wave whose values alternate between +V/2
and âˆ’V/2.

This problem (see Figure 10.111) involves a capacitor and two
switches. The switches are periodically driven by external clock controls at frequency f0
such that first S1 is closed and S2 is open for time 1
, and then S2 is closed and S1 open
2f0
for time 1
