SCATTERING.â€”Basically, scattering losses are caused by the interaction of light with density
fluctuations within a fiber. Density changes are produced when optical fibers are manufactured. During
manufacturing, regions of higher and lower molecular density areas, relative to the average density of the
fiber, are created. Light traveling through the fiber interacts with the density areas as shown in figure
2-22. Light is then partially scattered in all directions.
