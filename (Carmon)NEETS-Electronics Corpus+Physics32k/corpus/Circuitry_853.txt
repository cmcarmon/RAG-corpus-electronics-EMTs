required)  and  requires  some  form  of  ultra-violet 
exposure  unit.  This  device  normally  comprises  a 
light-tight enclosure into the base of which one or 
more ultra-violet tubes are fitted. Smaller units are 
available  which  permit  exposure  of  boards 
measuring 250 mm × 150 mm while the larger units 
are suitable for boards of up to 500 mm × 350 mm. 
The more expensive exposure units are fitted with 
timers  which  can  be  set  to  determine  the  actual 
exposure  time.  Low-cost  units  do  not  have  such  a 
facility  and  the  operator  has  to  refer  to  a  clock  or 
wristwatch in order to determine the exposure time.
