Applications to Electric Circuits
As the foregoing example shows, the Laplace transform method is an elegant procedure than can be used for
solving electric circuits by transforming their describing integrodifferential equations into algebraic equations
and applying the rules of algebra. If there is more than one loop or nodal equation, their transformed equations
are solved simultaneously for the desired circuit current or voltage transforms, which are then inverted to obtain
the  time-domain  answers.  Superposition  is  not  necessary  because  the  various  source  functions  appearing  in
the equations are simply transformed into algebraic quantities.
