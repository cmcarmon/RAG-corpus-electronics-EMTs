The electromagnetic Ô¨Åeld in the microstrip is not contained
entirely in the substrate. Therefore, the propagating mode in
the microstrip is not a pure TEM but a hybrid one. Assuming a
quasi-TEM mode (valid for lower frequencies) of propagation
in the microstrip line, the phase velocity is given by:
