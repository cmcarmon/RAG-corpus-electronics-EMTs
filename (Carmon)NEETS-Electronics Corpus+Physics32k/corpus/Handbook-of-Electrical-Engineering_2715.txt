Each  partition  consists  of  the  cells  of  the  circuit  (colored  according  to  the  set  to  which  they  belong  and
labeled with an integer), the gain value associated with each free cell in the set from which the selected cell will
be moved (this value can be a negative number), and the nets (labeled with letters). In the Ô¨Ågure a cell that is
no longer free is distinguished by an empty circle placed inside the rectangle that represents that cell.
