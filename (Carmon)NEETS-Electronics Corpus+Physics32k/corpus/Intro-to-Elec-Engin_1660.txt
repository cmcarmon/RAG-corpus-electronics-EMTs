Note that the steady-state solution is generated by the pole associated with R(s), while the transient
terms resulting from a partial-fraction expansion are associated with the poles of the denominator.
In order to meet the requirements for the steady-state performance, as well as dynamic
performance of the feedback control system of Figure 16.2.7, it becomes necessary to provide
independent control of both performances. Practical methods that have gained widespread accep-
tance are
