v 2 <þ is an unknown constant that deﬁnes
the time proﬁle of the incipient failure mode n, and U (k)
denotes the unit step function. Abrupt failures are used to
represent the sudden change of the system dynamics, and the
incipient failures are used to describe the slow-varying aging
effect of the system component. The control objective is to
generate appropriate control signals to stabilize the system
and, possibly, drive the system outputs back to the desired
trajectories, y1(k þ d) 2 <, 8l ¼ 1, 2, . . ., m, in online situ-
ations with the presence of the abrupt and/or incipient faults.
Under the presence of component failures, the system dynam-
ics may change dramatically or keep changing with time, and
the change cannot be detected until it actually happens. Thus,
