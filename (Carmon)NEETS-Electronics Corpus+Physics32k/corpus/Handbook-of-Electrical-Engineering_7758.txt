Computers depend on memory to execute programs and to store program code and data. They also need access
to stored program code and data in a nonvolatile memory (i.e., a form in which the information is not lost
when the power is removed from the computer system). Different types of memory have been developed for
different tasks. This memory can be categorized according to its price per bit, access time, and other parameters.
Table 80.1 shows a typical hierarchy for memory which places the smallest and fastest memory at the top in
level  0  and  in  general  the  largest,  slowest,  and  cheapest  at  the  bottom  in  level  4  [Ciminiera  and Valenzano,
1987]. Auxiliary (secondary or mass) memory of level 4 forms the large storage capacity for program and code
that are not currently required by the CPU. This is usually nonvolatile and is at a low cost per bit. Computer
magnetic tape falls within this category and is the subject of this section.
