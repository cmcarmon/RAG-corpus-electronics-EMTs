An input signal can come from a microphone, a radio receiver, or any other source thatâ€™s capable of
producing a recordable signal. Some input signals can be recorded immediately, but some must be
processed first. This processing is needed when an input signal is weak, or is out of the frequency
response range of the recorder.
