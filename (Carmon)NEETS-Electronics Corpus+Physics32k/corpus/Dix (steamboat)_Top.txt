The steamboat Dix operated from 1904 to 1906 as part of the Puget Sound Mosquito Fleet. She was sunk in a collision which remains one of the most serious transportation accidents in the state of Washington to this day.
In May 2011, it was reported that wreckage likely to be that of the Dix had been confirmed off Seattle's Alki Point.
