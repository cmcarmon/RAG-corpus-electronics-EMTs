LC oscillators use a tank circuit of capacitors and 
inductors, connected either in series or parallel, to 
determine the frequency. Crystal oscillators are like 
LC oscillators except that crystal oscillators maintain 
a higher degree of stability. LC and crystal oscillators 
are used in the radio frequency (RF) range. They are 
not suitable for low-frequency applications. For low-
frequency applications, RC oscillators are used. RC 
oscillators use a resistance-capacitance network to 
 determine the oscillator frequency.
