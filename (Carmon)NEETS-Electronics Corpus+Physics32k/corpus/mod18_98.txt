Radar systems, like other complex electronics systems, are composed of several major subsystems
and many individual circuits. This section will introduce you to the major subsystems common to most
radar sets. A brief functional description of subsystem principles of operation will be provided. A much
more detailed explanation of radar subsystems will be given in chapters 2 and 3. Since most radar systems
in use today are some variation of the pulse radar system, the units discussed in this section will be those
used in pulse radar. All other types of radar use some variation of these units, and these variations will be
explained as necessary.
