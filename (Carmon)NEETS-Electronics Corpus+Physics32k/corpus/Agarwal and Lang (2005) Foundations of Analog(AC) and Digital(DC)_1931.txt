The frequency response plots (see Figure 13.24) of the RL circuit in
Figure 13.11 show that it rejects (that is, attenuates) high frequencies and passes
(that is, does not affect) low frequencies, and therefore behaves like a low-pass
filter. The RC circuit in Figure 13.15 behaves like a band-pass filter because
it passes frequencies that fall within a certain band and rejects both very low
frequencies and high frequencies (see Figure 13.17). In general, we can build
many other types of filters as well. Figure 13.30 shows in abstract form the
magnitude curves of the frequency response for several types of filters.
