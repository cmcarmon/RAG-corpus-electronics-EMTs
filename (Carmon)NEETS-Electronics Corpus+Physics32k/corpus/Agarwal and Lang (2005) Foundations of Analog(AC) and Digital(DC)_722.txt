When designing logic devices, we are often interested in maximizing the
noise margins to achieve maximum noise immunity. Referring to Figure 5.8,
the 0 noise margin, NM0 = VIL − VOL, can be maximized by maximizing
VIL and minimizing VOL. Similarly, the 1 noise margin, NM1 = VOH − VIH,
can be maximized by maximizing VOH and minimizing VIH. As we will see in
Chapter 6, the maximum noise margins for devices are limited by the device
characteristics or by considerations of symmetry between the low and high
noise margins.

company Yehaa Microelectronics, Inc. has developed a new process technology that is
able to produce large quantities of a certain type of digital device known as an adder at
a very low cost. For a logical 0, their adders produce a voltage level of 0.5 V at their
outputs. Similarly, when outputting a logical 1, their adders produce the voltage level of
4.5 V. Furthermore, the Yehaa adders are able to interpret all signals between 0 V and
2 V at their inputs as a logical 0, and all signals between 3 V and 5 V as a logical 1.
