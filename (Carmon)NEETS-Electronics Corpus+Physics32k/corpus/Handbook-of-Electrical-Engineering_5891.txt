A  typical  superconducting  design  of  an  ac  generator,  as  in  the  conventional  design,  has  the  ﬁeld  winding
mounted on the rotor and armature winding on the stator. The main differences between the two designs lie
in the way cooling is done. The rotor has an inner body which is to support a winding cooled to a very low
temperature by means of liquid helium. The liquid helium is fed to the winding along the rotor axis. To maintain
the low temperature, thermal insulation is needed, and this can be achieved by means of a vacuum space and
a radiation shield. The outer body of the rotor shields the rotor’s winding from being penetrated by the armature
ﬁelds  so  that  the  superconducting  state  will  not  be  destroyed.  The  stator  structure  is  made  of  nonmagnetic
material, which must be mechanically strong. The stator windings (armature) are not superconducting and are
typically  cooled  by  water.  The  immediate  surroundings  of  the  machine  must  be  shielded  from  the  strong
magnetic ﬁelds; this requirement, though not necessary for the machine’s operation, can be satisﬁed by the use
of a copper or laminated iron screen.
