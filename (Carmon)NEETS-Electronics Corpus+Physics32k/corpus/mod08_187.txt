You should recall that the frequency response of an a.c. circuit is limited by the reactive elements
(capacitance and inductance) in the circuit. As you know, this is caused by the fact that the capacitive and
inductive reactances vary with the frequency. In other words, the value of the reactance is determined, in
part, by frequency. Remember the formulas:
