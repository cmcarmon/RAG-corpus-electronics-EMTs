. Continuity of tangential ~EE and ~HH is naturally main-
tained across an interface of dissimilar materials if
the interface is parallel to one of the lattice coordi-
nate axes. For this case, there is no need to specially
enforce ﬁeld boundary conditions at the interface. At
the beginning of the problem, we simply specify the
material permittivity and permeability at each ﬁeld
component location. This yields a stepped or ‘‘stair-
case’’ approximation of the surface and internal
geometry of the structure, with a space resolution
set by the size of the lattice unit cell.
