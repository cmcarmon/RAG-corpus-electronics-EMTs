Tumors are associated with low-frequency (delta) waves. However, other intracranial lesions also produce
slow waves. Although the EEG can identify the location of tumors, usually it cannot differentiate between brain
injury, infection, and vascular accident, all of which produce low-frequency waves. Interpretation of the EEG
always includes other clinical information.
