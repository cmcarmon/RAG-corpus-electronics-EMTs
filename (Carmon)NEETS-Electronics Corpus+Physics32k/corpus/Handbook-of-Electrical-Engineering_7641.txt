Detect/Modulate Devices
In the most general terms the self-electro-optic effect device (SEED) technology corresponds to any device based
on  multiple  quantum  well  (MQW)  modulators.  The  basic  physical  mechanism  used  by  this  technology  is  the
quantum conﬁned Stark effect. This mechanism creates a shift in the bandedge of a semiconductor with an applied
voltage. This is illustrated in Fig. 79.25(a). This shift in the bandedge is then used to vary the absorption of incident
light on the MQW material. When this MQW material is placed in the intrinsic region of a pin diode and electrically
connected to a resistor as shown in Fig. 79.25(b) the characteristic curve shown in Fig. 79.25(c) results. When the
incident intensity, gi, is low there is no current ﬂowing through the pin diode or resistor; thus the majority of the
voltage is across the pin diode. If the device is operating at the wavelength l0, the device will be in a low absorptive
state. As the incident intensity increases so does the current ﬂowing in the pin diode; this in turn reduces the voltage
across the diode which increases the absorption and current ﬂow. This state of increasing absorption creates the
nonlinearity in the output signal, y, shown in Fig. 79.25(c). Optical logic gates can be formed by optically biasing
the R-SEED close to the nonlinearity, gb, and then applying lower level data signals g1 and g2 to the device.
