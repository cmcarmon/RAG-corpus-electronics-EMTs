The generator, shown in figure 1-30, provides the voltage, which creates an electric field, and
current, which creates a magnetic field. This source voltage and current build up to maximum values in
one direction during one half-cycle, and then build up to maximum values in the other direction during
the next half-cycle. Both the electric and magnetic fields alternate from minimum through maximum
values in synchronization with the changing voltage and current. The electric and magnetic fields reach
their maximum intensity a quarter-cycle apart. These fields form the induction field. Since the current and
voltage that produce these E and H fields are 90 degrees out of phase, the fields will also be 90 degrees
out of phase.
