Figure 4.5 shows how this sequence of signals portrays the signal more accurately as more terms are added.
We need to assess quantitatively the accuracy of the Fourier series approximation so that we can judge
how rapidly the series approaches the signal. When we use a truncated series, the error—the diﬀerence
between the signal and the Kth-harmonic series—corresponds to the unused terms from the series.
