D/A Conversion Processes
Digital codes are typically converted to analog voltages by assigning a voltage weight to each bit in the digital
code and then summing the voltage weights of the entire code. A general D/A converter consists of a network
of precision resistors, input switches, and level shifters to activate the switches to convert a digital code to an
analog current or voltage. D/A ICs that produce an analog current output usually have a faster settling time
and better linearity than those that produce a voltage output. When the output current is available, the designer
can convert this to a voltage through the selection of an appropriate output ampliÔ¨Åer to achieve the necessary
response speed for the given application.
