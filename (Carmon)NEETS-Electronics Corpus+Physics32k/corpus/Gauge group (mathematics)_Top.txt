A gauge group is a group of gauge symmetries of the Yang – Mills gauge theory of principal connections on a principal bundle. Given a principal bundle



P
→
X


{\displaystyle P\to X}
with a structure Lie group



G


{\displaystyle G}
, a gauge group is defined to be a group of its vertical automorphisms. This group is isomorphic to the group



G
(
X
)


{\displaystyle G(X)}
of global sections of the associated group bundle






P
~



→
X


{\displaystyle {\widetilde {P}}\to X}
whose typical fiber is a group



G


{\displaystyle G}
which acts on itself by the adjoint representation. The unit element of



G
(
X
)


{\displaystyle G(X)}
is a constant unit-valued section



g
(
x
)
=
1


{\displaystyle g(x)=1}
of






P
~



→
X


{\displaystyle {\widetilde {P}}\to X}
.
At the same time, gauge gravitation theory exemplifies field theory on a principal frame bundle whose gauge symmetries are general covariant transformations which are not elements of a gauge group.
It should be emphasized that, in the physical literature on gauge theory, a structure group of a principal bundle often is called the gauge group.
In quantum gauge theory, one considers a normal subgroup

{\displaystyle G^{0}(X)}
of a gauge group



G

{\displaystyle G(X)}

{\displaystyle G(X)}
. This group

If a structure group

{\displaystyle G}

{\displaystyle {\overline {G}}_{k}(X)}
