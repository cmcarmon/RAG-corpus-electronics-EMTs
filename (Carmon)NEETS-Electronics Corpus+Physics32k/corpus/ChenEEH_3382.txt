Here u denotes the optimization control variables, and x de-
notes the network state variables that are dependent on u
through equation 8.14. The function f(x, u) is the objective
function to be minimized. The equations 8.14 denote the
equality constraints, and the number of equations of n in
equation 8.14 matches the dimension of x. The equation 8.15
represents k different inequality constraints.
