Parallel Database Systems
There has been a continuing increase in the amount of data handled by database management systems (DBMSs)
in recent years. Indeed, it is no longer unusual for a DBMS to manage databases ranging in sizes from hundreds
of gigabytes to terabytes. This massive increase in database sizes is coupled with a growing need for DBMSs to
exhibit  more  sophisticated  functionality  such  as  the  support  of  object-oriented,  deductive,  and  multimedia
applications.  In  many  cases,  these  new  requirements  have  rendered  existing  DBMSs  unable  to  provide  the
necessary system performance, especially given that many mainframe DBMSs already have difÔ¨Åculty meeting
the I/O and CPU performance requirements of traditional information systems that service large numbers of
concurrent users and/or handle massive amounts of data [DeWitt and Gray, 1992].
