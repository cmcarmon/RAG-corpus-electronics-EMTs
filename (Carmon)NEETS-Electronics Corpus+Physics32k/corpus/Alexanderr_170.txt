Throughout this book we consider only linear circuits. Note that since
p ⫽ i2R ⫽ v2兾R
(making it a quadratic function rather than a linear one),
the relationship between power and voltage (or current) is nonlinear.
Therefore, the theorems covered in this chapter are not applicable to power.
To  illustrate  the  linearity  principle,  consider  the  linear  circuit
shown in Fig. 4.1. The linear circuit has no independent sources inside
it. It is excited by a voltage source 
which serves as the input. The
circuit is terminated by a load R. We may take the current i through R
According to the lin-
as the output. Suppose
