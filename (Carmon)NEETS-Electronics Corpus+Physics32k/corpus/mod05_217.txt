A typical rotating-field ac generator consists of an alternator and a smaller dc generator built into a
single unit. The output of the alternator section supplies alternating voltage to the load. The only purpose
for the dc exciter generator is to supply the direct current required to maintain the alternator field. This dc
generator is referred to as the exciter. A typical alternator is shown in figure 3-3, view A; figure 3-3, view
B, is a simplified schematic of the generator.
