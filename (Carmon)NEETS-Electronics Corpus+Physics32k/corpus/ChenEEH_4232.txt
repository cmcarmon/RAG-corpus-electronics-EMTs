has many advantages over a bus network. Some major advan-
tages are less noise and larger distance coverage resulting from
the use of repeaters and a high-speed link for the use of optical
ﬁber. The major problem with a ring network is the accumu-
lation of a timing jitter along the ring and across multiple
repeaters. This effect signiﬁcantly limits the size of a ring
network.
