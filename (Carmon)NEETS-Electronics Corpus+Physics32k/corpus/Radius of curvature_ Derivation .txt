Let γ be as above, and fix t. We want to find the radius ρ of a parametrized circle which matches γ in its zeroth, first, and second derivatives at t. Clearly the radius will not depend on the position γ(t), only on the velocity γ′(t) and acceleration γ″(t). There are only three independent scalars that can be obtained from two vectors v and w, namely v · v, v · w, and w · w. Thus the radius of curvature must be a function of the three scalars |γ′2(t)|, |γ″2(t)| and γ′(t) · γ″(t).
The general equation for a parametrized circle in ℝn is





g

(
u
)
=

a

cos
⁡
h
(
u
)
+

b

sin
⁡
h
(
u
)
+

c



{\displaystyle \mathbf {g} (u)=\mathbf {a} \cos h(u)+\mathbf {b} \sin h(u)+\mathbf {c} }

where c ∈ ℝn is the center of the circle (irrelevant since it disappears in the derivatives), a,b ∈ ℝn are perpendicular vectors of length ρ (that is, a · a = b · b = ρ2 and a · b = 0), and h : ℝ → ℝ is an arbitrary function which is twice differentiable at t.
The relevant derivatives of g work out to be

If we now equate these derivatives of g to the corresponding derivatives of γ at t we obtain

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}|{\boldsymbol {\gamma }}'^{\,2}(t)|&=\rho ^{2}h'^{\,2}(t)\\{\boldsymbol {\gamma }}'(t)\cdot {\boldsymbol {\gamma }}''(t)&=\rho ^{2}h'(t)h''(t)\\|{\boldsymbol {\gamma }}''^{\,2}(t)|&=\rho ^{2}\left(h'^{\,4}(t)+h''^{\,2}(t)\right)\end{aligned}}}

These three equations in three unknowns (ρ, h′(t) and h″(t)) can be solved for ρ, giving the formula for the radius of curvature:
