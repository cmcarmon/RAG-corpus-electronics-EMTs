Van Flandern espoused a set of principles for assessing ideas, and dubbed theories that he deemed compliant with these principles as "Deep Reality Physics." He claimed that mainstream scientific theories, especially the prevailing theories regarding the big bang, solar system formation, relativity, and electrodynamics, left unanswered questions and therefore did not meet his criteria and often advocated his own replacement theories. Van Flandern's seven principles were:

Every effect has an antecedent, proximate cause
No time reversal
No true action at a distance
No creation ex nihilo
No demise ad nihil
The finite cannot become infinite
Tangible, material entities cannot occupy the same space at the same time
