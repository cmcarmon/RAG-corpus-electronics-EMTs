The frequency-domain approach is not yet viable; what will we do when the input signal is inﬁnitely long?
The diﬀerence equation scenario ﬁts perfectly with the envisioned digital ﬁltering structure (Figure 5.24), but
so far we have required the input to have limited duration (so that we could calculate its Fourier transform).
The solution to this problem is quite simple: Section the input into frames, ﬁlter each, and add the results
together. To section a signal means expressing it as a linear combination of length-Nx non-overlapping
