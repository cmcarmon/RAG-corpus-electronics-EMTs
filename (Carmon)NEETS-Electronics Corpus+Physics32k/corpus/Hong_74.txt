One of the most useful types of diodes is the light-emitting diode (LED). When 
current flows in the forward direction, an LED emits light proportional to the amount of 
forward current. Recent advances in semiconductor materials have drastically increased 
the  power,  efficiency,  and  range  of  colors  of  LED’s.  It  will  not  be  long  before  many 
traditional lighting devices, such as fluorescent lights, are replaced by bright LED’s.
