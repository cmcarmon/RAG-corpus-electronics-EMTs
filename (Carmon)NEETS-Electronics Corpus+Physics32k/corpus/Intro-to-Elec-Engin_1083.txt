12.5.2 A synchronous motor operates continuously on
the following duty cycle: 50 hp for 8 min, 100
hp for 8 min, 150 hp for 10 min, 120 hp for 20
min, and no load for 14 min. Specify the required
continuous-rated hp of the motor. (Note: A motor
rating is normally chosen on the basis of the rms
value given by
rms hp =
