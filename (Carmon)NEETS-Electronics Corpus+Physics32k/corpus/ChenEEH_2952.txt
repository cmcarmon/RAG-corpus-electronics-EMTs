In a microwave system, a small signal can be measured even
when no applied signal is present. This is due to noise that can
come from several sources. The sensitivity of receiver compon-
ents, such as the low noise ampliﬁer (LNA) and mixer, is
fundamentally limited by the noise ﬁgures of their components
and background noise. For these reasons, noise is of funda-
mental
importance in many active microwave frequency
designs and will be covered brieﬂy in this section. Dominant
mechanisms are typically thermal noise and shot noise at
microwave frequencies. If a microwave device is used to di-
rectly convert a signal to baseband, 1/f noise may become
an important noise factor as well since 1/f noise determines
oscillator phase noise.
