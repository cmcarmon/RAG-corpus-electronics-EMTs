An integral term increases action in relation not only to the error but also the time for which it has persisted. So, if applied force is not enough to bring the error to zero, this force will be increased as time passes. A pure "I" controller could bring the error to zero, however, it would be both slow reacting at the start (because action would be small at the beginning, needing time to get significant), brutal (the action increases as long as the error is positive, even if the error has started to approach zero), and slow to end (when the error switches sides, this for some time will only reduce the strength of the action from "I", not make it switch sides as well), prompting overshoot and oscillations (see below). Moreover, it could even move the system out of zero error: remembering that the system had been in error, it could prompt an action when not needed. An alternative formulation of integral action is to change the electric current in small persistent steps that are proportional to the current error. Over time the steps accumulate and add up dependent on past errors; this is the discrete-time equivalent to integration.
