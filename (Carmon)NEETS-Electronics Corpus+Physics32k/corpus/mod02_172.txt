In studying the charging process of a capacitor, you must be aware that NO current flows THROUGH
the capacitor. The material between the plates of the capacitor must be an insulator. However, to an
observer stationed at the source or along one of the circuit conductors, the action has all the appearances of
a true flow of current, even though the insulating material between the plates of the capacitor prevents the
current from having a complete path. The current which appears to flow through a capacitor is called
DISPLACEMENT CURRENT.
