The advantage, of course, is that you can quickly determine what would happen to that
single resistor if it were of a value other than 2 â„¦ without having to go through a lot of analysis
again. Just plug in that other value for the load resistor into the Thevenin equivalent circuit
and a little bit of series circuit calculation will give you the result.
