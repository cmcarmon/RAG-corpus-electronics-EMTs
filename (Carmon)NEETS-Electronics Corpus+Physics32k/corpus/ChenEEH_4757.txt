There exist several analytical nonlinear models that charac-
terize the phenomenon of wing rock (Hsu and Lan, 1985;
Nayfeh et al., 1989; Elzebda et al., 1989). The model we use
here is the one presented in Nayfeh et al. (1989) and Elzebda
et al. (1989), which has the advantage over the model in Hsu
and Lan (1985) of being differentiable and, according to the
authors, slightly more accurate. This model is given by:
