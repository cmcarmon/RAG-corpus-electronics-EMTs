A microcavity with only a single quantum dot in it is built. The DBR’s can be grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). For the mirrors two materials with different indices of refraction are grown in alternate order. Their lattice parameters should match to prevent strain. A possible combination is a combination of aluminum arsenide- and gallium arsenide-layers. A material with smaller band gap is used to grow the quantum dot. In the first few atomic layers of growing this material, the lattice constant will match that of the DBR. A tensile strain appears. At a certain thickness, the energy of the strain becomes too big and the layer contracts to grow with its own lattice constant. At this point, quantum dots have formed naturally. The second layer of DBR’s can now be grown on top of the layer with the quantum dots.
The diameter of the pillar is only a few microns wide. To prevent the optical mode from exiting the cavity the micropillar must act as a waveguide. Semiconductors usually have relatively high indices of refraction about n≅3. Therefore, their extraction cone is small. On a smooth surface the micropillar works as an almost perfect waveguide. However losses increase with roughness of the walls and decreasing diameter of the micropillar.
The edges thus must be as smooth as possible to minimize losses. This can be achieved by structuring the sample with Electron beam lithography and processing the pillars with reactive ion etching.
