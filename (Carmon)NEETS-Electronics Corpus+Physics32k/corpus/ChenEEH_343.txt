Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering
Another major short channel effect deals with the reduction of
the threshold voltage as the channel length is reduced. In long
channel devices, the inï¬‚uence of source and drain on the
channel depletion layer is negligible. However, as channel
lengths are reduced, overlapping source and drain depletion
regions start having a large effect on the channel depletion
region. This causes the depletion region under the inversion
layer to increase. The wider depletion region is accompanied
by a larger surface potential, which makes the channel more
attractive to electrons. Therefore, a smaller amount of charge
on the gate is needed to reach the onset of strong inversion,
and the threshold voltage decreases. This effect is worsened
when there is a larger bias on the drain since the depletion
region becomes even wider. This phenomenon is called drain-
