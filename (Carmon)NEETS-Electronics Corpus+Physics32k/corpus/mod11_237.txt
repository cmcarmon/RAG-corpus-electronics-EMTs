BULK-EFFECT SEMICONDUCTORS are unlike normal pn-junction diodes in both construction 
and operation. Some types have no junctions and the processes necessary for operation occur in a solid 
block of semiconductor material. Other types have more than one junction but still use bulk-effect action. 
Bulk-effect devices are among the latest of developments in the field of microwave semiconductors and 
new applications are being developed rapidly. They seem destined to revolutionize the field of high-
power, solid-state microwave generation because they can produce much larger microwave power outputs 
than any currently available pn-junction semiconductors.
