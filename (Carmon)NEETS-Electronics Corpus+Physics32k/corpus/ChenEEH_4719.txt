Consider a single degree of freedom (SDOF) structure sitting
on a base isolation system consisting of hysteretically damped
bearings, and let the structure be subject to ground acceler-
ation â‚¬xxg (t) and a control force f (t ) supplied by a hydraulic
actuator. Such a system is shown in Figure 11.6 The forces
exerted by the individual bearings are modeled collectively.
The equation of motion for the horizontal displacement of
the mass m of the structure is as follows:
