In the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM), there are two Higgs doublets and the renormalization group equation for the top quark Yukawa coupling is slightly modified. This leads to a fixed point where the top mass is smaller, 170â€“200 GeV. Some theorists believe this is supporting evidence for the MSSM.
The "quasi-infrared fixed point" was proposed in 1981 by C. T. Hill, B. Pendleton and G. G. Ross. The prevailing view at the time was that the top quark mass would lie in a range of 15 to 26 GeV. The quasi-infrared fixed point has formed the basis of top quark condensation theories of electroweak symmetry breaking in which the Higgs boson is composite at extremely short distance scales, composed of a pair of top and anti-top quarks. Many authors have explored other aspects of infrared fixed points to understand the anticipated spectrum of Higgs bosons in multi-Higgs models.
