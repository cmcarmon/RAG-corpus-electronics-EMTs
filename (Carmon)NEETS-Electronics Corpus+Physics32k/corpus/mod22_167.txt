The cylinder method uses a cylinder as the basic reference point. When you look at figure 2-10, view 
A, you will see a disk pack containing six disk platters with 10 recording surfaces. Imagine you are 
looking down through the disk pack from the top. All the tracks with the same number line up vertically. 
Together they are called a cylinder. These 10 tracks, one on each recording surface, can be referenced by 
the 10 read/write heads on the five access arms at each discrete location where the access arms can be 
positioned.
