In this experiment, we will use a Th√©venin source as in Figure 10.8. The
source can be a standard laboratory square-wave generator. The input square
wave is marked as a in Figure 10.8. Several quite distinctive wave shapes for
vC(t) can be derived, depending on the relation between the period of the driving
square wave and the time constant RC of the network. These waveforms are
all essentially variations on the solution derived in the preceding sections.
