Radiant intensity is used to characterize the emission of radiation by an antenna:

{\displaystyle I_{\mathrm {e} ,\Omega }=E_{\mathrm {e} }(r)\,r^{2},}

where
Ee is the irradiance of the antenna;
r is the distance from the antenna.
Unlike power density, radiant intensity does not depend on distance: because radiant intensity is defined as the power through a solid angle, the decreasing power density over distance due to the inverse-square law is offset by the increase in area with distance.
Radiant intensity can as well characterize X-ray tube with filtration. X-ray tube output is defined for this purpose.
