and is therefore usually associated with low closed-loop voltage gain. For a 741 the slew rate is
0.5 V/µs at A = 1. For more recently developed op amps, the slew rate ranges from 5 to 100
V/µs. The effect of the slew rate in response to an input step voltage is shown in Figure 5.3.9.
If one attempts to make the output voltage change faster than the slew rate, nonlinearity will be
introduced. When specifying such output voltage requirements as rise time, output voltage, and
frequency, it is necessary to choose an op amp with a slew rate that meets the speciﬁcations. With
a sine-wave input, the slew rate limits a combination of maximum operating frequency and output
voltage magnitude.
