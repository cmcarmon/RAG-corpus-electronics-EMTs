These kinds of piston pumps are characterized by the following advantages:
high efficiency
high pressure (up to 1,000 bar or 14000psi)
low flow and pressure ripple (due to the small dead volume in the workspace of the pumping piston)
low noise level
very high load at lowest speed due to the hydrostatically balanced parts possible
no axial internal forces at the drive shaft bearing
high reliability
A disadvantage is the bigger radial dimensions in comparison to the axial piston pump, but it could be compensated with the shorter construction in axial direction.
