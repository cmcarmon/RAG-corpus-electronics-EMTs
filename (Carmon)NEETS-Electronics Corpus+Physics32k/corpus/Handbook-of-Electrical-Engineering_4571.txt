FIGURE  45.4 An  illustration  of  the  frequency  dependence  of  the  CRAY2  computer  time  required  for  some  standard
computer  models  applied  to  the  reference  problem  of  a  perfectly  conducting,  space-shuttle-sized  object  having  a  surface
area of 540 m2 [Miller, 1988]. At a sampling density of 100/l2, a total of 6,000 surface samples is assumed for an IE model
at 100 MHz for which LU decomposition of the direct (impedance) matrix requires about 1 h of CRAY2 time. The top, LU,
curve has a slope of f 6 as discussed in the text. The next two curves have slopes of  f 4, the upper corresponding to use of a
TD DE model (FDTD) as well as an iterative solution of the direct IE matrix, assuming acceptable convergence occurs in
100  iteration  steps.  The  third  curve  is  for  a  10-step  iterative  solution  of  the  IE  matrix.  The  bottom  three  curves  have  f 2
slopes.  The  upper  two  of  these  are  for  100-  and  10-step  iterative  solutions  used  in  connection  with  a  near-neighbor
approximation (NNA), wherein only the 100 and 10 largest interaction coefﬁcients are retained in the matrix, respectively.
The bottom curve is for the physical-optics approximation, in which the induced current is computed from the incident
magnetic ﬁeld. The effects of these different frequency slopes on the computer time can be seen to be extreme, emphasizing
the need for developing more efﬁcient solution procedures.
