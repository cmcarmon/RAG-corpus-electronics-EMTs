energy and gives more range to targets. The frequency deviation is controlled in a predetermined way (frequently
a linear sweep) so that a matched Ô¨Ålter can be used in the receiver. The large time-bandwidth product permits
the received pulse to be compressed in time to a short pulse in order to make an accurate range measurement.
A linear-sawtooth IFM/CW having similar pulse length, frequency deviation, and pulse repetition rate would
thus appear similar, although arrived at from different points of view.
