Consider the ﬁeld along the axis of a charged ring of
constant lineal charge density lC=m and radius a, as shown
in Figure 2.4(A). For the sake of convenience, the ring is
placed on the plane z ¼ 0 of the coordinate system. Then,
the differential element of charge in the primed (source) coor-
dinate system is a differential arc of the ring with charge
dq ¼ ldl0 ¼ ladw0

the axis a distance h from the center of the ring, the unprimed
