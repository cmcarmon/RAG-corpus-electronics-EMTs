Gas dynamics is the overview of the average value in the distance between two molecules of gas that has collided with out ignoring the structure in which the molecules are contained. The field requires a great amount of knowledge and practical use in the ideas of the kinetic theory of gases, and it links the kinetic theory of gases with the solid state physics through the study of how gas reacts with surfaces.
