The phantom circuit elements representing the capacitance and inductance of the wiring are: L1, L2,
C4, and C5. L1 represents the inductance of the input wiring. L2 represents the inductance of the output
wiring. C4 represents the capacitance of the input wiring. C5 represents the capacitance of the output
wiring.
