Furthermore, the symmetry and positive-deﬁniteness of M
can be exploited to obtain a special form of the LU triangular
decomposition of M so that the lower and upper triangular
matrices in the decomposition are the transpose of each other.
This alternative decomposition is known as the Cholesky
decomposition of M and permits M to be uniquely represented
(Golub and Loan, 1996) as the product:
BBt ¼ M ¼ L1Lt
