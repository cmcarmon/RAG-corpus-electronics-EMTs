Measuring resistance
You can run lots of different tests by using your multimeter as an ohmmeter 
that measures resistance. Obviously, you can test resistors to check their 
values or see whether they’ve been damaged, but you can also examine 
capacitors, transistors, diodes, switches, wires, and other components by 
using your ohmmeter. Before you measure resistance, however, be sure to 
calibrate your ohmmeter (as described in the earlier section “Setting Up Your 
Multimeter”).
