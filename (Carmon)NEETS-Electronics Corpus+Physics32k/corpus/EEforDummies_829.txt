a moving, warm object is nearby. (Using two 
crystals in the PIR sensor enables the sensor 
to  differentiate  between  events  that  affect 
both crystals equally and simultaneously (such 
as changes in room temperature) and events 
that affect the crystals differently (such as a 
warm body moving past first one crystal, and 
then the other).
Industrial PIR motion detectors use or control 
120‐volt circuits and are designed to mount on a 
wall or on top of a floodlight. For hobby  projects 
using  a  battery  pack,  you  need  a  compact 
motion detector that works with about 5 volts. 
A typical compact motion detector has three 
leads:  ground,  positive  voltage  supply,  and 
detector output. If you supply +5 volts to the 
detector, the voltage on the output lead reads 
about  0  volts  when  no  motion  is  detected  or 
about 5 volts when motion is detected. You can 
find compact motion detectors through online 
vendors of security systems, but be sure to buy 
a motion detector, rather than just a PIR sensor. 
The lens included in a motion detector helps 
the device detect the motion of an object rather 
than just the presence of an object.
