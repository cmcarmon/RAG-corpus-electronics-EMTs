With no trigger pulse applied, the pfn charges through T1, the pfn, and the charging coil L1 to the
potential of Eb. When a trigger pulse is applied to the grid of V2, the tube ionizes causing the pulse-
forming network to discharge through V2 and the primary of T1. As the voltage across the pfn falls below
the ionization point of V2, the tube shuts off. Because of the inductive properties of the pfn, the positive
discharge voltage has a tendency to swing negative. This negative overshoot is prevented from damaging
the thyratron and affecting the output of the circuit by V1, R1, R2, and C1. This is a damping circuit and
provides a path for the overshoot transient through V1. It is dissipated by R1 and R2 with C1 acting as a
high-frequency bypass to ground, preserving the sharp leading and trailing edges of the pulse. The
hydrogen thyratron modulator is the most common radar modulator.
