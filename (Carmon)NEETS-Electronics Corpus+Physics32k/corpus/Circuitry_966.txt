the  table.  You  should  find  that  the  equation 
balances every time! 
  Earlier  we  looked  at  equations.  The  shape  of  a 
graph  is  dictated  by  the  equation  that  connects  its 
two  variables.  For  example,  the  general  equation 
for a straight line takes the form: 
 
y = m x + c
where  y is  the  dependent  variable  (plotted  on  the 
vertical  or  y-axis),  x is  the  independent  variable 
(plotted on the horizontal or x-axis), m is the slope 
(or gradient) of the graph and c is the intercept on 
the y-axis. Fig. A8.9 shows this information plotted 
on a graph. 
  The values of m (the gradient) and c (the y-axis 
intercept) 
the 
specifications  for  electronic  components.  In  the 
previous example, the electronic component (in this 
case a thermistor) has: 
 
(a)  a resistance of 100 W at 0°C (thus  c = 100 G)
(a)  a  characteristic  that  exhibits  an  increase  in 
resistance  of  0.5  W  per  °C  (thus  m = 0.5 
 
  W/°C).
