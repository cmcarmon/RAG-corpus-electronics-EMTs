An electrical network is describable by a system of algebraic and differential equations known as the primary
relations.
system of equations obtained by applying the Kirchhoff ’s current and voltage laws and the element 
In the case of linear networks, these equations can be transformed into a system of linear algebraic equations
by means of the Laplace transformation, which is relatively simple to manipulate. The main drawback is that
it contains a large number equations. To reduce this number, three secondary systems of equations are available:
components,
the nodal system, the cutset system, and the loop system. If a network has 
linearly independent
there are 
equations in loop analysis. These equations can then be solved to yield the Laplace transformed solution. To
obtain  the  ﬁnal  time-domain  solution,  we  must  take  the  inverse  Laplace  transformation.  For  most  practical
networks, the procedure is usually long and complicated and requires an excessive amount of computer time.
As  an  alternative  we  can  formulate  the  network  equations  in  the  time  domain  as  a  system  of  ﬁrst-order
differential equations, which describe the dynamic behavior of the network. Some advantages of representing
the network equations in this form are the following. First, such a system has been widely studied in mathe-
matics, and its solution, both analytic and numerical, is known and readily available. Second, the representation
can easily and naturally be extended to time-varying and nonlinear networks. In fact, computer-aided solution
of time-varying, nonlinear network problems is almost always accomplished using the state-variable approach.
Finally, the ﬁrst-order differential equations can easily be programmed for a digital computer or simulated on
an analog computer. Even if it were not for the above reasons, the approach provides an alternative view of the
physical behavior of the network.
