gates  arranged  to  form  bistables  using  the  circuits 
shown in Figs 16.16(a) and 16.16(b), respectively. 
Figure 16.17 shows a rather neat extension of this 
theme in the form of a touch-operated switch. This 
arrangement is based on a 4011 CMOS quad two-
input  NAND  gate  (though  only  two  gates  of  the 
package  are  actually  used 
this  particular 
configuration).
