Summary Comments
From this brief review it is clear that there are many uses for CW radars, and various types (such as fuzes) have
been produced in large quantities. Because of their relative simplicity, today there are continuing trends toward
the use of digital processing and integrated circuits. In fact, this is exempliÔ¨Åed in articles describing FM/CW
radars built on single microwave integrated circuit chips [Maoz et al., 1991; Chang et al., 1995].
