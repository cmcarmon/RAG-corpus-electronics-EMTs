Large signal ampliﬁers are usually conﬁned to using bipolar transistors as their solid state devices because of
the  large  linear  region  of  ampliﬁcation  required.  One  exception  to  this  is  the  use  of VMOS  for  large  power
outputs  due  to  their  ability  to  have  a  large  linear  region.  There  are  three  basic  conﬁgurations  of  ampliﬁers:
common emitter (CE) ampliﬁers, common base (CB) ampliﬁers, and common collection(CC) ampliﬁers. The
basic conﬁguration of each is shown in Fig. 28.1.
