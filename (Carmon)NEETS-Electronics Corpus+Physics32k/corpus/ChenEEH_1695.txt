A novel approach proposed by Liu and Chen (2002) argues
that at the shot boundary, the contents of new shot differ from
contents of the whole previous shot instead of just the previous
frame. They proposed a generic and recursive principal com-
ponent analysis-based approach that can be built on any fea-
ture extracted from frames in a shot and that generates a
model of the shot trained from features in previous frames.
Features from the current frame are extracted, and a shot
boundary is declared if the features from the current frame
do not match the existing model by projecting the current
feature onto the existing eigenspace.
