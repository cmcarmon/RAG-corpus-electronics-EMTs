. Publish–subscribe: In this model, many components
interact with one another in a many-to-many architec-
ture. To achieve this, this publish–subscribe model intro-
duces an intermediate level between the components that
acts to mediate the communications. Components can be
designated as publishers, which produce data, and sub-
scribers, which require data as input. An example of a
publisher is a sensor that produces measurements. An
example of a subscriber is a control algorithm that re-
quires the measurements from the sensor. In a complex
control system, there may be many publishers and many
subscribers. For example, a process control system may
have distributed components using many processors, or
at least many separate algorithms all using similar data,
and numerous sensors producing data.
