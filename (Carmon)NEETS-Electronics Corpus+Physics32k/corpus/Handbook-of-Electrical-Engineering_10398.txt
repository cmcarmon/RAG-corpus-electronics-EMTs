c. Computer-based data and information systems. From the communications and surveillance capabilities
above,  the  objective  has  become  formation  of  a  consistent  tactical  picture  throughout  the  operations
theatre. Rapidly evolving processing technology allows vast amounts of data handling and management
with  corresponding  shortening  of  control  decisionmaking  times.  The  ability  to  match  computer  pro-
cessing  capability  with  high  data  rate,  reliable,  and  survivable  computer-grade  communications  on  a
global basis to small mobile platforms is an ongoing challenge. Military information systems, in order
to retain trusted functioning, require procedures for input data that may have been delayed, omitted,
partial, inaccurate, or irrelevant (DOPII). Expanding amounts of software-based systems are needed as
a response to increased tempo, data volume, and quality while reducting staff and manpower functions.
d. Architectures and architectural thinking. C3 assets, especially communications, are evolving as assets to
be  shared,  controlled,  and  rapidly  reallocated  rather  than  be  dedicated  to  a  speciﬁc  user.  Joint  and
combined operations, requiring improved interoperability, are becoming common as operations become
more regionalized. Two functions of focus, Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) and Indicators and Warn-
ings (I&W), are best implemented when surveillance, communications, and intelligence are architectur-
ally  integrated.  Integrated  systems  are  also  best  for  timely  response  to  deception  and  false  alarms.  A
current Navy direction is not to inundate the aﬂoat commander with volumes of unsolicited data but
rather have him request what is needed. This style, called information pull, represents a signiﬁcant change
from  traditional  information  push.  The  impact  on  supporting  communications  is  to  give  it  a  more
“bursty” character, driven by external events.
