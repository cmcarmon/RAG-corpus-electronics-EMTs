Often it may be assumed, with good approximation, that the
transmit properties of each antenna are unaffected by the
presence of the other elements. This assumption is valid
when the mutual-coupling effects between the antennas have
negligible effects on the radiation characteristics of the indi-
vidual elements. Under this practical approximation, the total
radiation from the array can be further simpliÔ¨Åed:
