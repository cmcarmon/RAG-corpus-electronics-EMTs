For this type of structure, the ﬁeld distribution is a combi-
nation of TE and TM modes. Those modes are referred to as
hybrid modes or longitudinal section electric (LSE) and longi-
tudinal section magnetic (LSM) modes (Balanis, 1989). Using
perturbation technique shows that, in general, the cutoff fre-
quency of the partially ﬁlled waveguide is between the same
air-ﬁlled waveguide and the one that is fully loaded:
