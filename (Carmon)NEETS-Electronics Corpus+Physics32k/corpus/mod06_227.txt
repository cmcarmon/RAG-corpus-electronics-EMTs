right-hand plate of Cc. This is the biasing charge cycle. You may wonder why the charge current went
through the tube rather than through Rg. When the grid goes positive in response to the positive-going
input signal, electrostatic attraction between the grid and cathode increases. This, in turn, reduces the
resistance (rgk) between the grid and cathode. Current always follows the path of least resistance. Thus,
the capacitor charge path is through the tube and not through Rg.
