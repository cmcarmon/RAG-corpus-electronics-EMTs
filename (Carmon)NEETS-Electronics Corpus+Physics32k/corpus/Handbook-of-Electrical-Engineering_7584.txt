Observe that the output transistors T4 and T5 are always active and function as emitter followers, providing
the low-output impedances required for driving capacitive loads. As T1A and/or T1B turn on, and T2 turns off
as a consequence, the transition is accomplished with very little current change in the 365-W emitter resistor.
It follows that the supply current from VEE does not undergo the sudden increases and decreases prevalent in
TTL,  thus  eliminating  the  need  for  decoupling  capacitors.  This  is  a  major  reason  why  ECL  can  be  operated
successfully with the low noise margins which are inherent in logic having a relatively small voltage difference
between the HIGH and LOW voltage levels (see Table 79.7). The small level shifts between LOW and HIGH
also permit low propagation times without excessively fast rise and fall times. This reduces the effects of residual
capacitive coupling between gates, thereby lessening the required noise margin. For this reason the faster ECL
(100xxx) should not be used where the speed of the 10xxx series is sufﬁcient. A comparison of three ECL series
is  given  in  Table  79.7.  The  propagation  times tPLH and  tPHL  and  transition  times  tTLH  and  tTHL  are  deﬁned  in
Fig. 79.7. Transitions are between the 20 and 80% levels.
