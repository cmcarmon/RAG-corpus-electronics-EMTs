For the sake of clarity, the regional approach is applied here
to the one-dimensional (1-D) structure of a pn-junction, as-
suming an abrupt doping proﬁle as shown in Figure 5.1(B)
that also contains the respective dimensions used in the subse-
quent analysis. The lateral (y-) dimensions of the junction
deﬁne the diode area A shown in Figure 5.1(A).
