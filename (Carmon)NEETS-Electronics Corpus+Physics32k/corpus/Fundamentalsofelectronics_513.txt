(a) Sketch the spectrum of the demodulated signal produced by a coherent demodulator tuned to fc Hz.
(b) Will this demodulated signal be a “scrambled” version of the original? If so, how so; if not, why not?
(c) Can you develop a receiver that can demodulate the message without knowing the oﬀset frequency fc?
