Programmable arrays or programmable logic devices (PLDs) are general-purpose combinational or sequential
digital components whose ultimate function is determined by the designer. They leave the manufacturer in an
unprogrammed state. The conﬁgurations of internal switches are ﬁxed after the particular logic function for
the PLD has been prepared and checked using a computer-aided design package appropriate for the PLD family
used. PLDs belong to the family of application-speciﬁc integrated circuits (ASICs).
