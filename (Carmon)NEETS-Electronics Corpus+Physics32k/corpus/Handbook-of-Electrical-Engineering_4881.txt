where r21 is a component of the resistivity tensor sometimes called the Hall resistivity. Comparing Eqs. (52.1)
and (52.9) it is clear that the B dependence of EH is contained in r12. However, nothing in the derivation of r12
excludes the possibility of terms to the second or higher powers in B. Although these are usually small, this is
one of the reasons that experimentally one usually obtains R from the measured transverse voltage by reversing
magnetic  ﬁelds  and  averaging  the  measured  EH  by  calculating  (1/2)[EH (B)  –  EH (–B)].  This  eliminates  the
second-order term in B and in fact all even power terms contributing to the  EH. Using the Onsager relation
[Smith and Jensen, 1989, p. 60] r12(B) = r21(–B), it is also easy to show that in terms of the Hall resistivity
