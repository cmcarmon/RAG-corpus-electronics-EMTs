In order to display branch currents in SPICE, we need to insert zero-voltage sources in line
(in series) with each resistor, and then reference our current measurements to those sources.
For whatever reason, the creators of the SPICE program made it so that current could only be
calculated through a voltage source. This is a somewhat annoying demand of the SPICE sim-
ulation program. With each of these ”dummy” voltage sources added, some new node numbers
must be created to connect them to their respective branch resistors:
