In the system illustrated in figure 4-14, data to be sent to the main computer's cpu is entered through 
a remote online user terminal (far left). As the data is keyed, it is keyed in digital form and sent to a 
nearby modem to be converted into an analog signal suitable for transmission. This converted data is then 
transmitted over the telephone (or land) lines to another modem, that is located near the main computer 
system's cpu. The data, now in digital form, can be sent directly to the cpu for processing. The same route 
is followed when information is sent from the cpu back to the remote terminal.
