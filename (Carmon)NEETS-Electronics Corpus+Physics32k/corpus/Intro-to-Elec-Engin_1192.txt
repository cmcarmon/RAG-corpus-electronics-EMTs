Interpoles and Compensating Windings
The most generally used method for aiding commutation is by providing the machine with inter-
poles, also known as commutating poles, or simply as compoles. These are small, narrow auxiliary
poles located between the main poles and centered on the interpolar gap. The commutating
(interpole) winding is connected in series with the armature.
