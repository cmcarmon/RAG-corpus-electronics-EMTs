In the far-ﬁeld region, r  R. This condition has been used in
equation 6.175 to approximate r0 in the denominator by r. In
addition, for a small loop, R  l0 ¼ 2p
, which is equivalent to
Rk0  1. This condition can be used to further approximate
equation 6.175 by approximating one of the exponential func-
tions in the numerator:
