Reserve Monitoring
Maintaining  enough  reserve  capacity  is  required  in  case  generation  is  lost.  Explicit  formulas  are  followed  to
determine the spinning (already synchronized) and ready (10 min) reserves required. The availability can be
assured by the operator manually, or, as mentioned previously, the ED can also reduce the upper dispatchable
limits of the generators to keep such generation available.
