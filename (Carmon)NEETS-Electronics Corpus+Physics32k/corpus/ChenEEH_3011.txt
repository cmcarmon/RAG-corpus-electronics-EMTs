As seen in Figure 11.18, CPW feeding is very natural to
implement. Microstrip feeding may also be used, either by
using vias to connect the microstrip transmission line or by
electromagnetic coupling. With electromagnetic coupling, a
quarter-wave open circuited microstrip transmission line is
used to form a virtual short at the far side of the slot. If
designed properly, all of the energy will couple to the slot
antenna.
