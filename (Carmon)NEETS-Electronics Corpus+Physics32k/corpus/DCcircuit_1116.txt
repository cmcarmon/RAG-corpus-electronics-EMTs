Notice how much better the battery’s true condition is revealed when its voltage is checked
under load as opposed to without a load. Does this mean that its pointless to check a battery
with just a voltmeter (no load)? Well, no. If a simple voltmeter check reveals only 7.5 volts for
a 13.2 volt battery, then you know without a doubt that its dead. However, if the voltmeter
were to indicate 12.5 volts, it may be near full charge or somewhat depleted – you couldn’t tell
without a load check. Bear in mind also that the resistance used to place a battery under load
must be rated for the amount of power expected to be dissipated. For checking large batteries
such as an automobile (12 volt nominal) lead-acid battery, this may mean a resistor with a
power rating of several hundred watts.
