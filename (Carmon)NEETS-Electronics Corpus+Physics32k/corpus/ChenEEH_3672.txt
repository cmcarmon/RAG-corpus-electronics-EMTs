In the general DT model, a vocal-tract system T(z) is cas-
caded with a radiation model R(z). [We henceforth include any
nasal-tract dynamics in the vocal-tract model T(z).] This
system is excited by an uncorrelated excitation signal, say
{en}, or by a ﬁltered version of {en}. During unvoiced speech
activity, the excitation {en} is a ﬂat-spectrum noise source that
excites the vocal tract model directly. During periods of voiced
speech activity, the excitation is a periodic DT impulse train
whose period corresponds to the desired fundamental fre-
quency.9 A more realistic voicing signal is created by using
