From an energy perspective, when you apply a DC source to an inductor, it 
stores electrical energy in a magnetic field. When you remove the DC source 
and connect a resistor across the inductor, the energy is transferred to the 
resistor, where it dissipates as heat. Inductors store electrical energy in mag-
netic fields. A real inductor — as opposed to a theoretical ideal inductor —  
exhibits a certain amount of resistance and capacitance in addition to induc-
tance, due to the physical properties of its windings and core material as well 
as the nature of magnetic fields. Consequently, an inductor (unlike a capaci-
tor) can’t retain electrical energy for very long because energy is lost through 
heat dissipation.
