Spinning drop method facilitates the measurement of surface tension compared to other widely used methods. Because in this method, measuring the contact angle is not required between a solid surface and the liquid. Another advantage of the method is that it is not necessary to estimate the curvature at the interface, which usually brings difficulties with taking the first and second derivatives describing the shape of the fluid drop.
On the other hand, this theory suggested by Vonnegut, is restricted with the rotational velocity. Spinning drop method is not expected to give accurate results for the high surface tension measurements, since the centrifugal force that is required to maintain a cylindrical shape of the drop is much higher in the case of liquids that has high interfacial tensions.
