Strip Detectors
Silicon  strip  detectors  are  currently  fabricated  on  silicon  wafers  (typically  approximately  300 µ  thick)  using
photolithographic masking to implant the rectifying contact in strips [27]. The strips usually have a pitch on
the order of 100 µ and a width less than half of this to minimize strip-to-strip capacitance and hence electronic
noise [28]. The device is biased past depletion, and the back blocking contact is continuous. Each strip requires,
in principle, its own signal processing electronics; however, charge division readout (capacitive or resistive) can
reduce  the  number  of  ampliﬁers  by  a  factor  of  10.  Detectors  are  fabricated  in  rectangular  segments  from  a
single wafer, and can be ganged together if a larger area is needed.
