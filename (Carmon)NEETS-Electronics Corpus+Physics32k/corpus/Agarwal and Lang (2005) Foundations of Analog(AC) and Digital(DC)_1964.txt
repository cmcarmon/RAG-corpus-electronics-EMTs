It is possible to tie together the time-domain solution with the previous
frequency-domain solution by assuming the driving waveform to be a square
wave. The time-domain solution for the over-compensated case (C1 is large)
now looks like Figure 13.50. In particular, make a note of the relatively higher
values of the output signal at the transition points.
