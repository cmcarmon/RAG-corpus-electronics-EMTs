Let's review what each part of a good power supply does to a signal, as shown in figure 4-51. The ac 
voltage is brought in from the power line by means of the line cord. This voltage is connected to the 
primary of the transformer through the ON-OFF switch (S1). At the secondary winding of the transformer 
(points 1 and 2), the scope shows you a picture of the stepped-up voltage developed across each half of 
the secondary winding-the picture is that of a complete sine wave. Each of the two stepped-up voltages is 
connected between ground and one of the two anodes of the rectifier diodes. At the two rectifier anodes 
(points 4 and 5), there is still no change in the shape of the stepped-up voltage-the scope picture still 
shows a complete sine wave.
