We can design a phase shift keying system to be inherently
differential and thus solve the detection problems. The p=4
differential quadrature phase shift keying (p=4-DQPSK) is a
compromise modulation method because the phase is re-
stricted to ﬂuctuate between  p=4, and  3p=4 rather than
the  p=2 phase changes for OQPSK. The method has a
spectral efﬁciency of about 20% more than the Gaussian min-
imum shift keying (see upcoming section) modulation used
for DECT and GSM.
