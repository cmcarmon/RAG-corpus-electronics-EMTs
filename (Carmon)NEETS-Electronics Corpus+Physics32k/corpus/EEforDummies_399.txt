What’s really happening is that as the AC source voltage rises from 0 volts 
to its peak voltage, the capacitor charges, just as it does when you apply 
a DC voltage. When the supply voltage is at its peak, the capacitor may or 
may not be fully charged (it depends on a bunch of factors, such as the size 
of the capacitor plates). Then the source voltage starts to decrease from its 
peak down to 0 volts. As it does, at some point, the source voltage becomes 
lower than the capacitor voltage. When this happens, the capacitor starts to 
discharge through the AC source. Then the source voltage reverses polarity 
and the capacitor discharges all the way. As the source voltage keeps heading 
down toward its negative peak voltage, charges start to build up in reverse on 
the capacitor plates: The plate that previously held more negative charges 
now holds positive charges, and the plate that previously held more posi-
tive charges now holds more negative charges. As the source voltage rises 
from its negative peak, the capacitor again discharges through the AC source, 
but in the direction opposite to that of its original discharge, and the cycle 
repeats. This continuous charge/discharge cycle can occur thousands — even 
millions — of times per second, as the capacitor tries to keep up, so to speak, 
with the ups and downs of the AC source.
