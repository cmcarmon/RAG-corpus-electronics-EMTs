Decibels (dB):  Logarithmic scale of representing the ratio of two quantities given as 10 log10(P1/P0) for power
level ratios and 20 log10(V1/V0) for comparing acoustic pressure or voltage ratios. A standard reference
pressure or intensity level in SI units is equal to 1 micropascal (1 pascal = 1 newton per square meter =
10 dyne per square centimeter).
