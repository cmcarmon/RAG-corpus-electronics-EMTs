Most  solders  are  an  alloy  of  two  metals;  tin  (Sn) 
and  lead  (Pb).  The  proportion  of  tin  and  lead  is 
usually  expressed  as  a  percentage  or  as  a  simple 
ratio. For example, the term 60/40  solder  refers to 
an alloy which comprises 60% tin and 40% lead by 
weight.  The  proportion  of 
is 
instrumental in determining the melting point of the 
solder  alloy  and  the  proportion  of  the  constituents 
is usually clearly stated.  
In  the  past,  solder  was  often  categorized  by  its 
intended  application  and  the  terms  radio  solder,
