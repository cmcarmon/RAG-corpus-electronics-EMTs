A streak camera operates by transforming the time variations of a light pulse into a spatial profile on a detector, by causing a time-varying deflection of the light across the width of the detector. A light pulse enters the instrument through a narrow slit along one direction gets deflected in the perpendicular direction so that photons that arrive first hit the detector at a different position compared to photons that arrive later.
The resulting image forms a "streak" of light, from which the duration, and other temporal properties, of the light pulse can be inferred. Usually, in order to record periodic phenomena, a streak camera needs to be triggered accordingly, similarly to an oscilloscope.
