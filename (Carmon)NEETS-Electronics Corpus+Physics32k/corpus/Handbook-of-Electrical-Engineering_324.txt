The Substitution and Compensation Theorems
The Substitution Theorem
Any branch in a network with branch voltage, vk, and branch current, ik, can be replaced by another branch
provided it also has branch voltage, vk, and branch current, ik.
The Compensation Theorem

In a linear network, if the impedance of a branch carrying a current
corresponding change of any voltage or current elsewhere in the network will be due to a compensating voltage
