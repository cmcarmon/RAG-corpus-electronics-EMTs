This section examines the performance of the proposed NDP
design in a pendulum swing-up and balancing task. The case
under study is identical to the one in Santamaria et al. (1996).
The pendulum is held by one end and can swing in a vertical
plane. The pendulum is actuated by a motor that applied a
torque at the hanging point. The dynamics of the pendulum
are as follows:
