Observing the fact that semantic concepts in videos do not
appear in isolation but rather interact and appear in context,
their interaction is modeled explicitly, and a network of multi-
jects, called Multinet, was proposed (Naphade et al., 2002).
This framework based on Multinet takes into account the fact
that presence of some multijects in a scene boosts the detection
of other semantically related multijects and reduces the
chances for detection of others. Based on this Multinet frame-
work, spatiotemporal constraints can be imposed to enhance
detection, support inference, and impose a priori information.
