In short channel devices, the horizontal Ô¨Åeld in the channel
is high enough to reach the velocity saturation regime, which
degrades the drain current as well as the transconductance.
Velocity saturation can be reached even before pinch-off. With
velocity saturation, the drain current in the saturation region
can be expressed as:
