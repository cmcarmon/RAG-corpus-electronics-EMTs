The ﬁrst term in Eq. (38.34) is a constant phase offset corresponding to the center of beam range bin and
can be ignored from a resolution viewpoint. The second term, 2v r/l, is the Doppler frequency shift due to the
relative (radial) velocity between antenna and scattering element. The third term represents a quadratic cor-
rection of the linear ﬂight path to approximate the constant range sphere from a scattering element. It is worth
noting  that  synthetic  aperture  systems  do  not  require  the  assumptions  used  here,  but  accurate  position  and
motion compensation is required.
