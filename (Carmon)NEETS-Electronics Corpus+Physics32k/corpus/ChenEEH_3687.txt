Using the orthogonality principle from optimization
theory (Haykin, 1996), it can be shown that selecting param-
eters {^aai} such that {^een} has minimum power (i.e., minimum
E{^ee2
n} in which E denotes the statistical expectation) will also
result in the desired spectral whiteness of {^een}. Therefore, we
seek ^aa that minimizes the mean squared error (MSE) in
prediction; that is:
E{^ee2
