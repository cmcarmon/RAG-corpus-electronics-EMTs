The Cepstrum
As its name suggests, cepstral analysis represents a variation
on speech spectral analysis. The nominal goal of cepstral
processing is a representation of a voiced speech signal, the
cepstrum, in which the excitation information is separated, or
deconvolved from the dynamics of the speech system impulse
response. With such a representation,
the speech system
dynamics and the excitation signal can be studied, coded,
and manipulated separately. Applications of the cepstrum
have included pitch detection (using the voice component)
and ‘‘homomorphic’’ vocoding (using the speech production
system component of the cepstrum to derive an efﬁcient repre-
sentation of the speech dynamics) (Deller et al., 2000; Rabiner
and Huang, 1993). The history of the cepstrum is interesting
and the details of the theory are extensive. The objective of
this treatment is to present an overview of the main concepts
and then focus on a modern application of the cepstrum in
which most of the connections to the original motivations and
theoretical underpinnings are obscured.
