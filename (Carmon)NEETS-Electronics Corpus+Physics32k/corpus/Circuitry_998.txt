log10(1,000) = log10(103) = 3
and so on. 
  So far we have used values (10, 100 and 1,000) 
in our examples that just happen to be exact powers 
of 10. So how do we cope with a number that isn’t 
an  exact  power  of  10?  If  you  have  a  scientific 
calculator  this  is  quite  easy!  Simply  enter  the 
number  and  press  the  ‘log’  button  to  find  its 
logarithm  (the  instructions  provided  with  your 
calculator will tell you how to do this).  
  You might like to practice with a few values, for 
example: 
 
log10(56) = 1.748 
log10(1.35) = 0.1303 
log10(4,028) = 3.605 
log10(195,891) = 5.292 
log10(0.3175) = 20.4983 
there’s  another  advantage  of  using 
Finally, 
in 
logarithmic  units  (i.e.  Bels  and  decibels) 
electronics.  If  two  values  are  multiplied  together 
the  result  is  equivalent  to  adding  their  values 
expressed in logarithmic units.  
  To put all of this into context, let’s assume that 
the following items are connected in the signal path 
of an amplifier (see Fig. A8.33): 
 
Pre-amplifier; input power = 1 mW, output power 
= 80 mW 
Tone control; input power = 80 mW, output power 
= 20 mW 
Power  amplifier;  input  power  =  20  mW,  output 
power = 4 W 
 
The  power  gain  of  each  component,  expressed  as 
both a ratio and in dB is shown in the table below:
