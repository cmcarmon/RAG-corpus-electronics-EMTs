Because Zener diodes are so good at maintaining a constant reverse‐biased 
voltage, even as current varies, they’re used to regulate voltage in circuits. In 
the circuit in Figure 9­8, for example, a 9 V DC supply is being used to power 
a load, and a Zener diode is placed so that the DC supply exceeds the break­
down voltage of 6.8 V. (Note that this voltage is reverse‐biasing the diode.) 
Because the load is in parallel with the Zener diode, the voltage drop across 
the load is the same as the Zener voltage, which is 6.8 V. The remaining 
supply voltage is dropped across the resistor (which is there to limit the cur­
rent through the diode so the power rating is not exceeded).
