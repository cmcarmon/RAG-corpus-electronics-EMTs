The rise and fall of circuit values such as voltage and current in response to a transient is,
as was mentioned before, asymptotic. Being so, the values begin to rapidly change soon after
the transient and settle down over time. If plotted on a graph, the approach to the Ô¨Ånal values
of voltage and current form exponential curves.
