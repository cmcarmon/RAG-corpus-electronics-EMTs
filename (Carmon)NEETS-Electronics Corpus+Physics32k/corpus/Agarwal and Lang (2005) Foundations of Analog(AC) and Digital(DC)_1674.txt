With the inclusion of the gate capacitance CGS2 of the MOSFET in the
second inverter, and the interconnect inductance LI between then two inverters,
the circuit shown in Figure 12.1 becomes the circuit shown in Figure 12.4. The
latter circuit contains a capacitor and an inductor, and so it is a second-order
circuit. Note that vOUT1 and vIN2 are now no longer equal. The second-order
nature of the new circuit is more readily seen in Figure 12.5, which is extracted
