An OEM damper consists of an outer mass bonded/vulcanized to an inner hub. An aftermarket performance damper consists a mass which attached/mounted to a housing (steel, aluminum, titanium, etc.). Based on the different types of damper and where the mass is controlled differently. The first three use older technology; First is the liquid type damper which surrounds the mass immersed in the housing which is then bonded or welded together. Second is the o-ring type which surrounds the mass with a number of o-rings as it sits in its housing. Third is the friction type which has clutches and spring acting on the mass inside the outer housing. Fourth is the newest type in which the mass sits over and is attached an elastomer ring which is then attached to the outer housing. The crankshaft and damper together become (in its torsional response) a spring–mass–damper system again which can only occur by the two being interference fit together.
