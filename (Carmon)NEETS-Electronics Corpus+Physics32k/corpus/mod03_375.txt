Figure 2-19, view A, shows the trip element with normal current. The bimetallic element is not
heated excessively and does not bend. If the current increases (or the temperature around the circuit
breaker increases), the bimetallic element bends, pushes against the trip bar, and releases the latch. Then,
the contacts open, as shown in figure 2-19, view B.
