For many applications, such as low-noise ampliﬁers and
oscillators, noise plays an important role. Fundamental noise
mechanisms are thermal noise in series resistances, shot noise
in junction and transfer currents, and ﬂicker noise. The latter
is a phenomenological model for taking into account (physi-
cally usually not well described) low-frequency noise sources at
surfaces and interfaces (Markus and Kleinpenning, 1995; Deen
et al., 1999; Chen et al., 1998). The high-frequency (hf) noise
performance of modern bipolar transistors is mostly deter-
mined by the noise in rB( ¼ r
by the parasitic capacitances.
