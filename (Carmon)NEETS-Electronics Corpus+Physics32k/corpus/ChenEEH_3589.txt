In equation 2.2, vLP is the cutoff frequency of the designed
low-pass ﬁlter. The vLP shall be chosen to guarantee no alias-
ing (i.e., vc < vLP < vs=2). The impulse response in the
above equation is depicted in Figure 2.5. It is easy to verify
that a causal ﬁlter with this exact impulse response cannot be
implemented. In practice, it is possible to design analog ﬁlters
that are good approximations for the frequency response in
Figure 2.5.
