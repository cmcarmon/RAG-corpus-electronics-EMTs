The time taken for a bus to complete its duties is related to the number of people trying to board or alight at stops. The bus that is already late tends to collect more waiting riders due to the longer headway between it and the previous bus. The higher number of riders boarding the bus delays it further. At the same time, the following bus tends to collect fewer passengers, because its headway is shorter due to the delay of its predecessor, and hence it spends less than expected time on stops, which further shortens its headway. These effects tend to accumulate, unless the later vehicle deliberately idles on stops or slows down, or the lead vehicle skips some stops where it has no drop-offs, leaving the pick-ups for the following bus.
