. Inheritance is a property relating to the hierarchy of
objects. A superclass of objects has certain properties
common to all subclasses that inherit from it. The sub-
classes can reuse predeﬁned methods (or function calls)
of the superclass without having to redeﬁne the methods
themselves. Thus, inheritance promotes software reuse.
When applying the software to a new application, only
certain methods need to be specialized; the rest can
remain unchanged.
