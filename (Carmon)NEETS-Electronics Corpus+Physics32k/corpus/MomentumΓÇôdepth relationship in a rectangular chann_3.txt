{\displaystyle M_{1}+M_{2}=F_{w}+F_{f}+F_{P1}+F_{P2}}

Where:
M = momentum per unit time (ML/t2)
Fw = gravitational force due to weight of water (ML/t2)
Ff = force due to friction (ML/t2)
FP = pressure force (ML/t2)
subscripts 1 and 2 represent upstream and downstream locations, respectively
Units: L = length, t = time, M = mass
Applying the momentum-force balance in the direction of flow, in a horizontal channel (i.e. Fw = 0) and neglecting the frictional force (smooth channel bed and walls):

V = flow velocity (L/t)

{\displaystyle {\overline {P}}}
= average pressure (M/Lt2)
A = cross sectional area of flow (L2)
subscripts 1 and 2 represent upstream and downstream locations, respectively
Units: L (length); t (time); M (mass)
The hydrostatic pressure distribution has a triangular shape from the water surface to the bottom of the channel (Figure 1). The average pressure can be obtained from the integral of the pressure distribution:

{\displaystyle Q=V_{1}A_{1}=V_{2}A_{2}}

For the case of rectangular channels (i.e. constant width “b”) the flow rate, Q, can be replaced by the unit discharge q, where q = Q/b, which yields:




q

subscripts 1 and 2 represent upstream and downstream locations, respectively.

In the above relationship both sides correspond to the specific force, or momentum function per channel width, also called Munit.

{\displaystyle M_{\text{unit}}={y^{2} \over 2}+{q^{2} \over gy}}

This equation is only valid in certain unique circumstances, such as in a laboratory flume, where the channel is truly rectangular and the channel slope is zero or small. When this is the case, it is possible to assume that a hydrostatic pressure distribution applies. Munit is expressed in units of L2. If the channel width is known, the full specific force (L3) at a point can be determined by multiplying Munit by the width, b.
