The Margolus–Levitin theorem, named for Norman Margolus and Lev B. Levitin, gives a fundamental limit on quantum computation (strictly speaking on all forms on computation). The processing rate cannot be higher than 6 × 1033 operations per second per joule of energy. Or stating the bound for one bit:
A quantum system of energy E needs at least a time of





h

4
E





{\displaystyle {\frac {h}{4E}}}
to go from one state to an orthogonal state, where h is Planck's constant (6.626 × 10−34 J·s) and E is average energy.
The theorem is also of interest outside of quantum computation, e.g. it relates to the holographic principle, digital physics, simulated reality, the mathematical universe hypothesis and pancomputationalism.
