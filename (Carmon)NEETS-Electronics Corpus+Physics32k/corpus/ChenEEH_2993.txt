Of particular interest for a detector is the small-signal current
responsivity, b0, deﬁned to be the change in dc current due
to application of
the RF signal divided by time-average
power. The change in dc current will be given by the second
term on the right-hand side of
the preceding equation
(Di=I0 ¼ a2A2=4). Since the change in current is proportional
to the square of the amplitude of the input voltage, the
small-signal operation is known as square-law detection.
Taking the product of the diode current and voltage and
integrating over one period, the small-signal current respon-
sivity is simply:
