As of October 2014, Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) has contracted with a Louisiana shipyard to build a floating landing platform for reusable orbital launch vehicles. The initial platform has an approximately 90 by 50 meters (300 ft Ã— 160 ft) landing pad surface and is capable of precision positioning with diesel-powered Azimuth thrusters so the platform can hold its position for launch vehicle landing. This platform was first deployed in January 2015 when SpaceX attempted a controlled descent flight test to land the first stage of Falcon 9 Flight 14 on a solid surface after it was used to loft a contracted payload toward Earth orbit. The platform utilizes GPS position information to navigate and hold its precise position. The rocket landing leg span is 18 m (60 ft) and must not only land within the 52 m (170 ft)-wide barge deck, but must also deal with ocean swells and GPS errors.
SpaceX CEO Elon Musk displayed a photograph of the "autonomous spaceport drone ship" in November 2014. The ship is designed to hold position to within 3 meters (9.8 ft), even under storm conditions.
On 8 April 2016, the first stage of the rocket that launched the Dragon CRS-8 spacecraft, successfully landed for the first time on the drone ship named Of Course I Still Love You.
