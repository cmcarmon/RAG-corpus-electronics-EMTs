One complete gait cycle is defined as beginning when one foot comes into contact with the ground and continuing until that same foot contacts the ground again. The gait cycle can be further broken down into a number of component parts. Running, by definition, involves a maximum of one foot in contact with the ground at any given time and often no contact with the ground. When the foot is in contact with the ground it is referred to as the “stance phase”. The “aerial phase” is the period between contralateral foot contacts when the body is airborne. For one specific leg, the time of toe-off until subsequent heel contact is known as the “swing-phase” for that leg. One complete gait cycle involves a stance and swing phase for each leg.
Running is characterized as a “bouncing gait” rather than the inverted pendulum mechanism of walking. The stance phase of running can be sub-divided into two parts; during the first half energy is used to perform the negative work of both slowing and lowering the center of mass. In the second half of the stance phase energy is used to perform positive work to lift and accelerate the body. Because of the synchrony of the fluctuations of kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy experienced by the center of mass, mechanical work during running is performed by optimizing the combination of conserved elastic energy in tendons from lengthening and muscle contraction.
