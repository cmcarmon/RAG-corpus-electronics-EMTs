Equation 12.42 is the characteristic equation of the circuit. It is slightly more
complex than Equation 12.7 because of the term proportional to s. We will see
shortly that this term is responsible for damping and energy loss. To simplify
Equation 12.42, and to put it in a form that is more standard for the characteristic
equation in second-order circuits, we write it as
s 2 + 2αs + ω2◦ = 0
