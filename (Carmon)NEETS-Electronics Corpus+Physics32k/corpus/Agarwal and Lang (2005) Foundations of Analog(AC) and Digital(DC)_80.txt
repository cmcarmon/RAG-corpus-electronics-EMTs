As illustrated in Figure 1.5, a lumped element can be idealized to the point
where it can be treated as a black box accessible through a few terminals. The
behavior at the terminals is more important than the details of the behavior
internal to the black box. That is, what happens at the terminals is more impor-
tant than how it happens inside the black box. Said another way, the black box
is a layer of abstraction between the user of the bulb and the internal structure
of the bulb.
