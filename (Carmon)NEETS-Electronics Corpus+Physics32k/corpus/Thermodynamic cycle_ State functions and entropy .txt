If Z is a state function then the balance of Z remains unchanged during a cyclic process:







∮





⁡
d
Z
=
0


{\displaystyle \oint dZ=0}
.
Entropy is a state function and is defined as




S
=


Q
T




{\displaystyle S={Q \over T}}

so that




Δ
S
=



Δ
Q

T




{\displaystyle \Delta S={\Delta Q \over T}}
,
then it appears that for any cyclic process,







∮





⁡
d
S
=



∮





⁡



d
Q

T


=
0


{\displaystyle \oint dS=\oint {dQ \over T}=0}

meaning that the net entropy change of the working fluid over a cycle is zero.
