generation and load at any instant. This ACE must be ﬁltered or smoothed such that excessive and random
changes in ACE are not translated into control action. Since these excessive changes are different for different
systems, the ﬁlter parameters have to be tuned speciﬁcally for each control area. The ﬁltered ACE is then used
to obtain the proportional plus integral control signal. This control signal is modiﬁed by limiters, deadbands,
and  gain  constants  that  are  tuned  to  the  particular  system.  This  control  signal  is  then  divided  among  the
generating units under control by using participation factors to obtain
