Generally, we are interested in minimizing the intersymbol
interference at the time when we do our detection (the sample
time in a sample and hold circuit). Thus, we can model the
equalizer as a series of equal time delays (rather than random
as in the general case) with the shortest delay interval being a
bit interval. We then construct a receiver that determines req,
the equalized signal:
