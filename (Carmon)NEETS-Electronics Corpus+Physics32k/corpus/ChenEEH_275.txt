Noise from an analog (or small-signal) perspective is a
random time-varying signal that is generated in all passive
and active electronic devices. It can be represented as either a
current or a voltage, in(t ) or vn(t). Over a Ô¨Åxed time period, t,
the average value of noise is zero. Analog noise, therefore, is
commonly presented in terms of its mean-square value (I 2
or V 2
square value (Irms or Vrms).
