â€¢ A person being shocked needs to be disconnected from the source of electrical power.
Locate the disconnecting switch/breaker and turn it off. Alternatively, if the disconnecting
device cannot be located, the victim can be pried or pulled from the circuit by an insulated
object such as a dry wood board, piece of nonmetallic conduit, or rubber electrical cord.
