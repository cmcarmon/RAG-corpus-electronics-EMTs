The junction in the JFET is reverse-biased for normal operation. No gate current ﬂows because
of the reverse bias and all carriers ﬂow from source to drain. The corresponding drain current is
dependent on the resistance of the channel and the drain-to-source voltage vDS. As vDS is increased
for a given value of vGS, the junction is more heavily reverse-biased, when the depletion region
extends further into the conducting channel. Increasing vDS will ultimately block or pinch off the
conducting channel. After the pinch-off, the drain current iD will be constant, independent of
vDS. Changing vGS (gate-to-source voltage) controls where pinch-off occurs and what the value
of drain current is.
