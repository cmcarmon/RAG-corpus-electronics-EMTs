PIC microcontrollers are widely available, inex-
pensive, and do not require a lot of prerequisites be-
fore running in an application. The PIC development 
environment is freely available and up to date. There 
is a broad range of different PIC microcontrollers, to 
fit any application. The hardware programming is easy 
and does not require a lot of additional equipment 
or programmers. The various PIC packages available 
include pDip (plastic dual in-line package), ssop 
(shrink small outline package), soiC (small outline 
package), pLCC (plastic leaded chip carrier), and QFN 
(quad flat no-lead package) (Figure 46-9). PIC pack-
ages allow for convenient prototyping without a lot of 
effort.
