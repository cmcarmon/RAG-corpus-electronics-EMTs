The earth, being a conductor (if only a poor one), will conduct current between the downed
line and the nearest system ground point, which will be some kind of conductor buried in the
ground for good contact. Being that the earth is a much poorer conductor of electricity than the
metal cables strung along the power poles, there will be substantial voltage dropped between
the point of cable contact with the ground and the grounding conductor, and little voltage
dropped along the length of the cabling (the following Ô¨Ågures are very approximate):
