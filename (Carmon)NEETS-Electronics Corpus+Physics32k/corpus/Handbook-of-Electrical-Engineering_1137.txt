Design of Other IIR Filters
For  frequency-selective  ﬁlters,  the  bilinear  transformation  of  an  elliptic  analog  ﬁlter  provides  an  optimal
equiripple  design.  However,  if  a  design  other  than  standard  low-pass,  high-pass,  band-pass,  or  bandstop  is
needed  or  if  it  is  desired  to  approximate  an  arbitrary  magnitude  or  group  delay  characteristic,  some  other
design technique is needed. Unlike the FIR case, there is no standard IIR design program for obtaining optimal
approximations to an arbitrary response.
