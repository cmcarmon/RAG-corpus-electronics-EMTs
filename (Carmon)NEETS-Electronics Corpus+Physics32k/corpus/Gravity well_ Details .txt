If G is the universal gravitational constant (G = 6.67×10−11 m3 kg−1 s−2), the external gravitational potential of a spherically symmetric body of mass M is given by the formula:

{\displaystyle \Phi (\mathbf {x} )=-{\frac {GM}{|\mathbf {x} |}}.}

A plot of this function in two dimensions is shown in the figure. This plot has been completed with an interior potential proportional to |x|2, corresponding to an object of uniform density, but this interior potential is generally irrelevant since the orbit of a test particle cannot intersect the body.
The potential function has a hyperbolic cross section; the sudden dip in the center is the origin of the name "gravity well". A black hole would not have this "closing" dip due to its size being only determined by its event horizon.
