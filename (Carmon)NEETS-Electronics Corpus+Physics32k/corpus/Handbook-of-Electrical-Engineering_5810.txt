where 3f means that the transformer is a three-phase piece of equipment (as opposed to an interconnection
of  three  single-phase  devices).  3W  means  three  three-phase  windings  (actually  nine  windings).  Usually  the
schematic is supplied also. The 15 kV rating is the line (phase-to-phase) value; three-phase apparatus is always
rated in line values. “Y” means winding No. 1 is internally wye connected. 115kVY means that 115 kV is the
line voltage rating, and winding No. 2 is wye connected. In 4.157kVD, again, “4.157kV” is the line voltage rating,
and  winding  No. 3  is  delta  connected.  100/100/20  MVA  are  the  total  (3f)  power  ratings  for  the  primary,
secondary, and tertiary winding, respectively; three-phase apparatus is always rated in three-phase terms.
