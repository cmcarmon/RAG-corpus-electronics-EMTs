In this realistic condition, it would only take 340 volts of potential from one of my hands
to the other to cause 20 milliamps of current. However, it is still possible to receive a deadly
shock from less voltage than this. Provided a much lower body resistance ﬁgure augmented
by contact with a ring (a band of gold wrapped around the circumference of one’s ﬁnger makes
an excellent contact point for electrical shock) or full contact with a large metal object such as
a pipe or metal handle of a tool, the body resistance ﬁgure could drop as low as 1,000 ohms (1
kΩ), allowing an even lower voltage to present a potential hazard:
