The generic computer contains input devices (keyboard, mouse, A/D (analog-to-digital) converter, etc.),
a computational unit, and output devices (monitors, printers, D/A converters). The computational unit
is the computerâ€™s heart, and usually consists of a central processing unit (CPU), a memory, and an
input/output (I/O) interface. What I/O devices might be present on a given computer vary greatly.
