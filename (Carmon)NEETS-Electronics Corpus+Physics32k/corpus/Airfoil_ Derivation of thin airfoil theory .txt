The airfoil is modeled as a thin lifting mean-line (camber line). The mean-line, y(x), is considered to produce a distribution of vorticity



γ
(
s
)


{\displaystyle \gamma (s)}
along the line, s. By the Kutta condition, the vorticity is zero at the trailing edge. Since the airfoil is thin, x (chord position) can be used instead of s, and all angles can be approximated as small.
From the Biot–Savart law, this vorticity produces a flow field

x


{\displaystyle x}
is the location where induced velocity is produced,




x

{\displaystyle x'}
is the location of the vortex element producing the velocity and



c

is the chord length of the airfoil.
Since there is no flow normal to the curved surface of the airfoil,

{\displaystyle w(x)}
balances that from the component of main flow



V


{\displaystyle V}
, which is locally normal to the plate – the main flow is locally inclined to the plate by an angle
