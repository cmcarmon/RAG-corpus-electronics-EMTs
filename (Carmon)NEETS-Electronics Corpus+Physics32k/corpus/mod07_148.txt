If we apply a positive input voltage (equal to or greater than the positive voltage supplied to the
anode) to the diode’s cathode, the diode will be reverse biased. In this situation, the diode is cut off and
acts as an open switch between the input and output terminals. Consequently, with no current flow in the
circuit, the positive voltage on the diode’s anode will be felt at the output terminal. Therefore, the diode
acts as an open switch when it is reverse biased.
