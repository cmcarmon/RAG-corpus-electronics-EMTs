New Shepard 4 (NS4)—the fourth propulsion module to be built—will be the first one to actually carry passengers. As of September 2017, Blue Origin projected that it would attempt to carry out the first human flight in 2018.
Additional vehicles are under construction. An initial build order of six vehicles was planned, each one taking 9 to 12 months to construct. After the initial build, and after completing an extensive test flight program, Blue Origin intends to "let the demand for space tourism and research determine how many additional vehicles may be needed."
