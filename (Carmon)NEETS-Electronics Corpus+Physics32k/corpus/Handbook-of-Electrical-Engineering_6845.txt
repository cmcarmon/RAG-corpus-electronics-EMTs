Detection of Signals in More General Noise Processes
In the foregoing paragraphs, we have described three basic detection procedures: correlation detection of signals
that  are  completely  known,  envelope  detection  of  signals  that  are  known  except  for  a  random  phase,  and
quadratic  detection  for  Gaussian  random  signals.  These  detectors  were  all  derived  under  an  assumption  of
white  Gaussian  noise.  This  assumption  provides  an  accurate  model  for  the  dominant  noise  arising  in  many
communication  channels.  For  example,  the  thermal  noise  generated  in  signal  processing  electronics  is  ade-
quately described as being white and Gaussian. However, there are also many channels in which the statistical
behavior of the noise is not well described in this way, particularly when the dominant noise is produced in
the physical channel rather than in the receiver electronics.
