Engine cooling systems can also have bleed screws. They can take the form of a bolt with a hole through the middle that is threaded into a hole on the vehicle's cylinder head. This hole goes into the water jacket of the cylinder head. In other designs, the bleed screw is placed in the uppermost hose which leads to the heater core, i.e. at the highest point of the cooling system.
When the bleed screw is loosened, antifreeze is added to the vehicle's cooling system and the increase in fluid pressure displaces air through the opened bleed screw. When liquid begins to flow out, all air has been removed from the system and the bleed screw is closed.
Bleed screws are not common on cars today and are only necessary when design of a vehicle's cooling system results in areas where air can be trapped in the system. Air in the system can lead to overheating of the engine and in modern cars also to poor vehicle operation (e.g. problems with the AC system or incorrect engine idle).
