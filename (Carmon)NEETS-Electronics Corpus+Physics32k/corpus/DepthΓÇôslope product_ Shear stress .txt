In order to convert the pressure into a shear stress, it is necessary to determine the component of the pressure that provides shear on the bed. For a channel that is at an angle



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }
from horizontal, the shear component of the stress acting on the bed

)



{\displaystyle /\left(\tau _{b}\right)}
, which is the component acting tangentially to the bed, equals the total pressure times the sine of the angle

{\displaystyle \tau _{b}=\rho gh\sin {\left(\alpha \right)}\,}

In natural rivers, the angle



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }
is typically very small. As a result, the small-angle formula states that:

{\displaystyle \sin {\left(\alpha \right)}\approx \tan {\left(\alpha \right)}}

The tangent of the angle

{\displaystyle \alpha }
is, by definition, equal to the slope of the channel,

{\displaystyle \tan {\left(\alpha \right)}\equiv S}

From this, we can arrive at the final form of the relation between bed shear stress and depth–slope product:
