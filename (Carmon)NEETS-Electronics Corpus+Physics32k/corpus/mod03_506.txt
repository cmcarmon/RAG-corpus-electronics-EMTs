With the switch in position 1 and the voltmeter connected between ground and terminal 1, the
voltmeter should indicate no voltage (OV). When the voltmeter is connected to terminal 2, the voltmeter
should indicate the source voltage. With the voltmeter connected to terminal 3, the source voltage should
also be indicated. The table in figure 3-16(C) will show you the correct readings with the switch in
position 2 or 3.
