Superposition of the load line and the diode iâ€“v curve is shown in Figure E7.2.3(d). From the
sketch we see that the load line intersects the diode curve at approximately 0.67 V and 27.5 mA,
given by the Q point (quiescent or operating point). The voltage across the 10- resistor of Figure
E7.2.3(a) is then given by
