 1-42. If a control transformer is held at
electrical zero and the control transmitter
is turned 90 degrees counterclockwise,
what is (a) the amplitude of the induced
voltage in the rotor of the control
transformer, and (b) the phase
relationship of this voltage and the
excitation voltage to the control
transmitter?
