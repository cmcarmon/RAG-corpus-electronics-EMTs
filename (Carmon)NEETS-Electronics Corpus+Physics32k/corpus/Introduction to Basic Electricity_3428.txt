Robert Noyce of Fairchild Semiconductor indepen-
dently developed his own idea for integrated circuit 
construction a half a year later than Jack Kilby. Noyce’s 
circuit solved Kilby’s problem of interconnecting all the 
components on the chip. He added the metal as a  final 
layer and then removed some of it so that the wires 
needed to connect the components were formed. This 
made the integrated circuit suitable for mass production.
