Gate Array ASIC Technology
The gate array technology [Hollis, 1987] is based on partially prefabricated (up to but not including the ﬁnal
metallization  layer)  wafers  with  simple  gate  cells.  Such  noncustomized  wafers  are  stockpiled  and  the  ASIC
designer speciﬁes the ﬁnal metallization layer added to customize the gate array. Gate array cells draw on the
general cell design shown earlier, Fig. 25.27(b). Figure 25.32 illustrates representative non-customized transis-
tor-level  cells  although  different  foundries  use  different  physical  layouts)  with  the  dashed  lines  representing
metal layers (including power and ground) added during the ﬁnal metallization process.
