A ﬁnite-impulse response (FIR) or transversal ﬁlter is composed of a series of cascaded time delay elements
which  are  sampled  or “tapped”  along  the  delay  line  path.  The  sampled  and  delayed  signal  is  summed  at  a
junction  which  yields  the  output  signal.  The  output  time  signal  is  ﬁnite  in  length  and  has  no  feedback.  A
schematic of an FIR ﬁlter is shown in Fig. 47.1.
