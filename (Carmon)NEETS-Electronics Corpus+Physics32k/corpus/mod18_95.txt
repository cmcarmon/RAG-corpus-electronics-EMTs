Either temperature inversion or moisture lapse, alone or in combination, can cause a large change in
the refraction index of the lowest few-hundred feet of the atmosphere. The result is a greater bending of
the radar waves passing through the abnormal condition. The increased bending in such a situation is
referred to as DUCTING and may greatly affect radar performance. The radar horizon may be extended
or reduced, depending on the direction the radar waves are bent. The effect of ducting on radar waves is
illustrated in figure 1-15.
