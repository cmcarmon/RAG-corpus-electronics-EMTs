Mixers convert (heterodyne) the input frequency to a new frequency, where Ô¨Åltering and/or gain is easier to
implement, in contrast to detectors, which are used to provide an output signal that contains the amplitude
or amplitude variation information of the input signal. A mixer is basically a multiplier, which requires two
