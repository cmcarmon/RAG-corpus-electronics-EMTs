The turn-off of the MOSFET involves the inverse sequence
of the events that occur during turn-on, and the turn-off
waveforms are also shown in Figure 7.16. During the switching
transient, the maximum power loss occurs during the cross-
over between voltage and current states. This power loss ori-
ginates from the charging and discharging of capacitors. Since
these capacitances do not vary with temperature, the switching
power loss in MOSFET is independent of temperature. The
on-state resistance and, hence, conduction loss, however, do
vary with temperature.
