As in the previous circuit illustration, the reference point of a circuit is always considered to be at
zero potential. Since the earth (ground) is said to be at a zero potential, the term GROUND is used to
denote a common electrical point of zero potential. In figure 3-30, point A is the zero reference, or
ground, and the symbol for ground is shown connected to point A. Point C is 75 volts positive in respect
to ground.
