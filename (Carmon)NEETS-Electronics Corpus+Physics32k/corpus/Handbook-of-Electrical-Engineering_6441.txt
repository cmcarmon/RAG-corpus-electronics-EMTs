multitude of tasks that a practical DS receiver must perform. In particular, the receiver must ﬁrst acquire the
PN waveform. That is, the local PN random generator that generates the PN waveform at the receiver used for
despreading must be aligned (synchronized) to within one chip of the PN waveform of the received DS/BPSK
signal. This is accomplished by employing some sort of search algorithm which typically steps the local PN
waveform sequentially in time by a fraction of a chip (e.g., half a chip) and at each position searches for a high
degree of correlation between the received and local PN reference waveforms. The search terminates when the
correlation exceeds a given threshold, which is an indication that the alignment has been achieved. After bringing
the two PN waveforms into coarse alignment, a tracking algorithm is employed to maintain ﬁne alignment.
The most popular forms of tracking loops are the continuous time delay-locked loop and its time-multiplexed
version of the tau-dither loop. It is the difﬁculty in synchronizing the receiver PN generator to subnanosecond
accuracy  that  limits  PN  chip  rates  to  values  on  the  order  of  hundreds  of  Mchips/s,  which  implies  the  same
limitation on the DS spread spectrum bandwidth Wss.
Frequency Hopping Modulation
A  frequency  hopping  (FH)  modulation  c(t)  is  formed  by  nonlinearly  modulating  a  train  of  pulses  with  a
sequence of pseudorandomly generated frequency shifts {fn}. In mathematical terms, c(t) has the complex form
