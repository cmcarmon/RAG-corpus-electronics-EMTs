Prevailing IUPAC definitions taken from the "Gold Book" are
atomic weight — See: relative atomic mass
and
relative atomic mass (standard atomic weight) — The ratio of the average mass of the atom to the unified atomic mass unit.
Here the "unified atomic mass unit" refers to ​1⁄12 of the mass of an atom of 12C in its ground state.
The IUPAC definition of relative atomic mass is:

An atomic weight (relative atomic mass) of an element from a specified source is the ratio of the average mass per atom of the element to 1/12 of the mass of an atom of 12C.

The definition deliberately specifies "An atomic weight…", as an element will have different relative atomic masses depending on the source. For example, boron from Turkey has a lower relative atomic mass than boron from California, because of its different isotopic composition. Nevertheless, given the cost and difficulty of isotope analysis, it is usual to use the tabulated values of standard atomic weights which are ubiquitous in chemical laboratories.
