Fiber, nerve: A single nerve cell; a neuron—classiﬁed on the presence or absence of myelin. Myelinated nerve
cells  have  diameters  typically  in  the  range  2  to  20  mm  and  conduction  velocities  of  5  to  120  m/s;
unmyelinated nerves have diameters from 0.3 to 1.3 mm and conduction velocities of 0.6 to 2.3 m/s. Fiber
lengths may be up to 1 m. The term nerve usually refers to a bundle of nerve ﬁbers.
