The feedback signal (Efdbk) can be shown in terms of the output signal (Eout) and the voltage divider
(R1 and R2). The voltage divider has the output signal on one end and ground (0 volts) on the other end.
The feedback signal is that part of the output signal developed by R1 (at point A). Another way to look at
it is that the feedback signal is the amount of output signal left (at point A) after part of the output signal
