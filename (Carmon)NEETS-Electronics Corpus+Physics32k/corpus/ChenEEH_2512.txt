induced once a voltage is applied between them. Such a cap-
acitor is easily realizable in a multilayered platform. Two
widely used structures are capacitors with overlay and inter-
digital topologies. The overlay capacitor is usually referred to
as metal-insulator-metal (MIM) with insulators made of low-
loss and temperature-stable thin-ﬁlm materials, such as cer-
amic, silicon nitride, silicon dioxide, and polyimide. The inter-
digital capacitor consists of a number of interleaved microstrip
ﬁngers coupled together as indicated in Figure 7.7. Usually, the
interdigital capacitor cannot be used to produce a capacitance
value above 1 pF and tends to saturate at high frequency even
with a large number of ﬁngers, whereas the MIM technique
