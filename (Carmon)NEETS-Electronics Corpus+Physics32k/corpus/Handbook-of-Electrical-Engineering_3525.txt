Synthesis translates or transforms a design from one level
of abstraction to another, more-detailed level of abstraction.
The more-detailed level of abstraction may be only an inter-
mediate  step  in  the  entire  design  process,  or  it  may  be  the
ﬁnal implementation. Synthesis programs that yield a ﬁnal
silicon  compilers
implementation  are  sometimes  called 
because the programs generate sufﬁcient detail to proceed directly to silicon fabrication [Ayres, 1983; Gajski, 1988].
Like design abstractions, synthesis techniques can be hierarchically categorized, as shown in Fig. 34.10. The
higher levels of synthesis offer the advantage of less complexity, but also the disadvantage of less control over
the ﬁnal design.
