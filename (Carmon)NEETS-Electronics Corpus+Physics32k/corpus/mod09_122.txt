In series, these reactances create a very low impedance. In parallel, they create a very high 
impedance. These characteristics govern how and where designers use resonant circuits. A low-
impedance requirement would require a series-resonant circuit. A high-impedance requirement would 
require the designer to use a parallel-resonant circuit.
