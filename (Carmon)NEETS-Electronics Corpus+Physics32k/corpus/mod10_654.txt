RADIATION PATTERN OF A DOUBLET.â€”The doublet is the simplest form of a practical 
antenna. Its radiation pattern can be plotted like the radiation pattern of the flashlight (fig. 4-12). Figure 
4-14 shows the development of vertical and horizontal patterns for a doublet. This in NOT a picture of the 
radiation, but three-dimensional views of the pattern itself. In three views the pattern resembles a 
doughnut. From the dimensions in these views, two types of polar-coordinate patterns can be drawn, 
horizontal and vertical. The HORIZONTAL PATTERN view A is derived from the solid pattern view C 
by slicing it horizontally. This produces view B, which is converted to the polar coordinates seen in view 
A. The horizontal pattern illustrates that the radiation is constant in any direction along the horizontal 
plane.
