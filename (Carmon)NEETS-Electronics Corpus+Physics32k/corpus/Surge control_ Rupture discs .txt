A rupture disc, also known as a burst disc, bursting disc, or burst diaphragm, is a onetime use, non-reclosing pressure relief device that, in most uses, protects a pressure vessel, equipment or system from over pressurization or potentially damaging vacuum conditions. A rupture disc is a sacrificial part because it has a one-time-use membrane that fails at a predetermined differential pressure, either positive or vacuum. The membrane is usually made out of metal, but nearly any material can be used to suit a particular application. Rupture discs provide instant response (within milliseconds) to an increase or decrease in system pressure, but once the disc has ruptured it will not reseal. Due to the one time usage of this disc it requires someone to replace the plate once it has ruptured. One time usage devices are initially cost effective, but can become time consuming and labor-intensive to repeatedly change out.
Advantages:
1) Isolates equipment from the process conditions, protecting the equipment until it is needed for a surge relief event.
2) Cost effective installation.
3) Very fast response time.
Disadvantages:
1) One time use.
2) Requires down time to replace.
3) A rupture disk has only one set point.
