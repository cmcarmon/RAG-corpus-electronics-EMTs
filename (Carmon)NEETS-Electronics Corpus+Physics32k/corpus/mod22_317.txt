In addition to an implied subject, every computer instruction has an explicit predicate consisting of at 
least two parts. The first part is referred to as the command, or operation; it answers the question "what?" 
It tells the computer what operation it is to perform; i.e., read, print, input. Each machine has a limited 
number of built-in operations that it is capable of executing. An operation code is used to communicate 
the programmer's intent to the computer.
