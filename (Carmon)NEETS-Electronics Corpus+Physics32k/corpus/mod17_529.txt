Once the initial predictions are complete and the satellite link becomes operational, very little change 
in these calculations is made. The orbits of a satellite will change slightly over a period of time; however, 
these changes are so gradual that predictions will be accurate enough to be used for weeks or even months 
without further corrections. When the orbits are known precisely, an ephemeris can be calculated for each 
satellite of the system.
