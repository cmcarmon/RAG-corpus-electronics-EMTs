We have caused the voltage across RL to vary by varying the grid voltage; but is it amplification?
Well, let's take a look at it. The grid voltage, or input signal, varies from +3 to -3 volts, or 6 volts. The
voltage drop across RL varies from 25 volts to 100 volts, or 75 volts. In other words, the triode has caused
a 6-volt input signal (varying) to be outputted as a signal that varies by 75 volts. That's amplification!
