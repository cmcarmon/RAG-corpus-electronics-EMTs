The repetition time T of the waveform is called the period of the waveform. For a waveform
to be periodic, it must continue indeﬁnitely in time. The dc waveform of Figure 1.1.5(a) can be
considered to be periodic with an inﬁnite period. The frequency of a periodic waveform is the
reciprocal of its period,
