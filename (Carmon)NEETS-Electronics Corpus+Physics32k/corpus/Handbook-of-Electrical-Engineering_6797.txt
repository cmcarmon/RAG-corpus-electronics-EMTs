Although  the  LIDB  was  originally  developed  to  support  Calling  Card  Service,  it  has  since  found  wide
application  in  the  telecommunications  industry.  For  example,  the  LIDB  is  used  to  translate  the  telephone
number of a calling party to a name as part of Calling Name Delivery service, or to convert that number to a
nine-digit ZIP code as part of Single Number Service. The LIDB databases now contain more than a quarter
of a billion customer records which are updated at a rate of more than a million changes per day. Although
physically distributed, the LIDBs appear logically as a single database. They represent a national resource.
