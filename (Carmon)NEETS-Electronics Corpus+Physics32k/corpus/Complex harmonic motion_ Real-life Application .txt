1 Bungee jumper provides a large force of bouncing by compressing the springs underneath it. The compression theoretically turns the kinetic energy into elastic potential energy. When the elastic potential energy reaches its top boundary, it can be exerted onto the object or child that presses on it within the form of kinetic energy.
2 Rubber band works the same as the spring.
free oscillator and the damping effects of air resistance and losses at the pivots mean it will eventually stop swinging. If the swing is pushed each time it reaches a certain point it behaves as a forced oscillator and will continue to swing for as long as energy is supplied.
