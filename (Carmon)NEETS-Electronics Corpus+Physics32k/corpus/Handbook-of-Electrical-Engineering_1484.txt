Papers on speech recognition are regularly published in the IEEE Speech and Audio Transactions (formerly part
of the IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing) and in the journal Computer Speech and
Language. Speech recognition research and technical exhibits are presented at the annual IEEE International
Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), the biannual European Conference on Speech
Communication and Technology (Eurospeech), and the biannual International Conference on Spoken Language
Processing (ICSLP), all of which publish proceedings. Commercial applications of speech recognition technol-
ogy  are  featured  at  annual  American  Voice  Input-Output  Society  (AVIOS)  and  Speech  Systems  Worldwide
meetings. A variety of standardized databases for speech recognition system development are available from
the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Gaithersburg, MD.
