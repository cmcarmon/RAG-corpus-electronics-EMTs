tropy are used a great deal. However, frequency domain features
obtained in the Fourier transform domain may also be useful.
Since, for analysis purposes, a scene must be segmented in
objects, there must be ways of extracting the objects and repre-
senting them. Edge extraction systems are some of the ﬁrst steps
for isolating the different image objects. They are usually based
on some form of gradient-based approach, where the edges are
associated to large gray level variations. Once the edges are
extracted, one can use contour following algorithms to identify
the different objects. Texture is also a useful feature to be used.
Once the features are extracted, one uses image segmenta-
tion algorithms to separate the images into different regions.
The simplest are the ones based on amplitude thresholding, in
which the features used for region determination are the
amplitudes of the pixels themselves; each region is deﬁned by
a range of amplitudes. If the features used are the edges, one
can use boundary representation algorithms to deﬁne the
regions in an image. One can also use clustering algorithms
to deﬁne a region as the set of pixels having similar features.
Quad-trees are a popular approach for deﬁning regions. Tem-
plate or texture matching algorithms can be used to deter-
mine which pixels represent a same shape or pattern, thereby
deﬁning regions based on them. These belong to the class of
pattern recognition algorithms that have, by themselves, a
large number of applications. In the case of image sequences
motion detection can be used to deﬁne the regions as the
pixels of the image having the same kind of movement. For
each region, one can also perform measurements, such as
perimeter area and Euler number. Mathematical mor-
phology (Serra, 1982) is a discipline commonly employed for
performing such measurements.
