Points 1, 2, and 3 are all common to each other, so the wire connecting point 1 to 2 is
labeled the same (wire 2) as the wire connecting point 2 to 3 (wire 2). In a real circuit, the
wire stretching from point 1 to 2 may not even be the same color or size as the wire connecting
point 2 to 3, but they should bear the exact same label. The same goes for the wires connecting
points 6, 5, and 4.
