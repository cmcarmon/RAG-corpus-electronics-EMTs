A closing pin is a curved piece of stainless steel metal used in the sport of skydiving. The pin is sewn onto the bridle which is a 7 to 10-foot long piece of nylon webbing connected to the pilot chute. The closing pin passes through the closing loop and in doing so, secures the main container of a skydiving rig, keeping the parachute from deploying prematurely. When the pilot chute is thrown out by the skydiver and catches air, it pulls the closing pin from the closing loop and allows the main parachute to be released from the container and inflate.
