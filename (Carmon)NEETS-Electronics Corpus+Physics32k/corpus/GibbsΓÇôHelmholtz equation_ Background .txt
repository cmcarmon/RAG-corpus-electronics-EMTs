The definition of the Gibbs function is




H
=
G
+
S
T




{\displaystyle H=G+ST\,\!}

where H is the enthalpy defined by:




H
=
U
+
p
V




{\displaystyle H=U+pV\,\!}

Taking differentials of each definition to find dH and dG, then using the fundamental thermodynamic relation (always true for reversible or irreversible processes):




d
U
=
T

d
S
−
p

d
V




{\displaystyle dU=T\,dS-p\,dV\,\!}

where S is the entropy, V is volume, (minus sign due to reversibility, in which dU = 0: work other than pressure-volume may be done and is equal to −pV) leads to the "reversed" form of the initial fundamental relation into a new master equation:




d
G
=
−
S

d
T
+
V

d
p




{\displaystyle dG=-S\,dT+V\,dp\,\!}

This is the Gibbs free energy for a closed system. The Gibbs–Helmholtz equation can be derived by this second master equation, and the chain rule for partial derivatives.
