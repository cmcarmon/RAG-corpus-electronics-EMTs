The time evolution operator must be unitary. This is because we demand that the norm of the state ket must not change with time. That is,




⟨
ψ
(
t
)

|

ψ
(
t
)
⟩
=
⟨
ψ
(

t

)

|


U

U

ψ

=
⟨

ψ

.


{\displaystyle \langle \psi (t)|\psi (t)\rangle =\langle \psi (t_{0})|U^{\dagger }(t,t_{0})U(t,t_{0})|\psi (t_{0})\rangle =\langle \psi (t_{0})|\psi (t_{0})\rangle .}

Therefore,

=

.


{\displaystyle U^{\dagger }(t,t_{0})U(t,t_{0})=I.}
