As C1 in figure 3-23 charges to a voltage of E, point A rises to a potential of E volts while point B is still
at zero volts. This makes E appear across L2. As C2 charges, point B rises to a potential of E volts as did
point A. At this time, point B is at E volts and point C rises. Thus, we have a continuing action of voltage
moving down the infinite line.
