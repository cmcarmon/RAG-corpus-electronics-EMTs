The output transducer transfers signals out of the electrical domain and into the do-
main that can be perceived by one of the Ô¨Åve human senses. A substantial amount of
power is usually required to transfer information out of the electrical domain. Examples
of output transducers are the motor, cathode-ray tube, loudspeaker, light-emitting diode,
radio-frequency transmitter, etc.
