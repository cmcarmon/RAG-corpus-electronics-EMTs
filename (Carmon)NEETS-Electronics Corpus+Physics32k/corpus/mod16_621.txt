The FOCUS control adjusts the beam size. The ASTIG (astigmatism) control adjusts the beam
shape. The FOCUS and ASTIG controls are adjusted together to produce a small, clearly defined circular
dot. When displaying a line trace, you will use these same controls to produce a well-defined line. Figure
6-17, view A, shows an out-of-focus beam dot. View B shows the beam in focus. Views C and D show
out-of-focus and in-focus traces, respectively.
