Kinds of Loadﬂow Instability
Two kinds of voltage instability have been associated with a loadﬂow model: loss of control voltage instability
and clogging voltage instability [Schlueter, 1998d]. Loss of control voltage instability is caused by exhaustion
of  reactive  power  supply  that  produces  loss  of  voltage  control  on  some  of  the  generators  or  synchronous
condensers. Loss of voltage control on these reactive supply devices implies both lack of any further reactive
supply from these devices and loss of control of voltage that will increase network reactive losses that absorb
a portion of the ﬂow of reactive power supply and prevent it from reaching the subregion needing that reactive
supply.  Loss  of  voltage  control  develops  because  of  equipment  outages  (generator,  transmission  line,  and
transformer), operating condition changes (wheeling, interchange, and transfer transactions), and load/gener-
ation pattern changes. Loss of control voltage instability occurs in the subtransmission and transmission system
[Schlueter, 1998d]. It produces either saddle node or singularity-induced bifurcation in a differential algebraic
model. On the other hand, clogging develops because of increasing reactive power losses, and switching shunt
capacitors  and  tap  changers  reaching  their  limits.  These  network  reactive  losses,  due  to  increasing  magnetic
ﬁeld and shunt capacitive supply withdrawal, can completely block reactive power supply from reaching the
subregion  with  need  [Schlueter,  1998d].  Clogging  voltage  instability  can  produce  algebraic  bifurcation  in  a
differential  algebraic  model.  The VSSAD  method  can  diagnose  whether  the  voltage  instability  occurs  due  to
clogging or loss of control voltage instability for each equipment outage, transaction combination, or both that
have no solution.
