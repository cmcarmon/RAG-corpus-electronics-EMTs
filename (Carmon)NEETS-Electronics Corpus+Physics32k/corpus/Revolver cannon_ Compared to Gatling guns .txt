Automatic revolver cannon generally have a lower maximum sustained rate of fire than Gatling guns, as all the rounds are fired through a single barrel, which suffers from much higher heating loads. Some cannon caliber Gatling guns have a rate of fire of up to 10,000 rounds per minute (such as the Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-6-23), while revolver cannon typically have a rate of fire no more than 2,000 rounds per minute. On the other hand, revolver cannon are generally able to be made much lighter than gatling guns, requiring less support and mounting hardware. Gatling type guns spin the whole multiple barrel and breech assembly, which in equal caliber versions can weigh hundreds of kilograms more. The firing rate of a Gatling-type gun is directly related to the rotational speed of the barrel cluster. The need to accelerate this cluster requires generally a large external power-supply and means that the maximum attainable rate of fire is not instantaneously available. Revolver cannon do not suffer from these limitations. Another difference is found in the inherent greater accuracy of the revolver cannon over the Gatling-type guns, caused by the dispersion of multiple barrels rotating at a varying speed of the latter. Gatling-type guns are most effective against a large group of infantry, while revolver cannons, with bigger caliber rounds deal with enemy armor such as a Tank or a BTR.
