Series  and  parallel  combinations  of 
inductors 
 
In order to obtain a particular value of inductance, 
fixed inductors may be arranged in either series or 
parallel as shown in Figs 2.39 and 2.40. 
  The  effective  inductance  of  each  of  the  series 
circuits  shown  in  Fig.  2.39  is  simply  equal  to  the 
sum  of  the  individual  inductances.  So,  for  the 
circuit shown in Fig. 2.39(a): 
 
L = L1 + L2
while for Fig. 2.39 (b) 
 
L = L1 + L2 + L3
Turning  to  the  parallel  inductors  shown  in  Fig. 
2.40,  the  reciprocal  of  the  effective  inductance  of 
each circuit is equal to the sum of the reciprocals of 
the individual inductances. Hence, for Fig. 2.40(a):
