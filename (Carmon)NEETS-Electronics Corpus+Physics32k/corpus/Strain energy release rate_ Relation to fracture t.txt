For two-dimensional problems (plane stress, plane strain, antiplane shear) involving cracks that move in a straight path, the mode I stress intensity factor (




K

I




{\displaystyle K_{I}}
) is related to the energy release rate (



G


{\displaystyle G}
) by




G
=

{\displaystyle G={\cfrac {K_{I}^{2}}{E'}}}

where



E


{\displaystyle E}
is the Young's modulus and




E

=

{\displaystyle E'=E}
for plane stress and

Therefore, the energy release rate failure criterion may also be expressed as

{\displaystyle K_{I}\geq K_{Ic}}

where
