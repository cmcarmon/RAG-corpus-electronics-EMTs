MPEG-4: Content-Based Video Coding
The intention of MPEG-4 was to provide low bandwidth video
compression at a data rate of 64 Kbps that can be transmitted
over a single N-ISDN B channel. This goal has evolved to the
development of ﬂexible, scalable, extendable, and interactive
compression streams that can be used with any communica-
tion network for universal accessibility (e.g., Internet and
wireless networks). MPEG-4 is a genuine multimedia com-
pression standard that supports audio and video as well as
synthetic and animated images, text, graphics, texture, and
speech synthesis (ISO/IEC, 1998). The foundation of MPEG-
4 is on the hierarchical representation and composition of
audio–visual objects (AVO). MPEG-4 provides a standard for
the conﬁguration, communication, and instantiation of object
classes: The conﬁguration phase determines the classes of
objects required for processing the AVO by the decoder. The
communication phase supplements existing classes of objects
in the decoder. Finally, the instantiation phase sends the class
descriptions to the decoder. A video object at a given point in
time is a video object plane (VOP). Each VOP is encoded
separately according to its shape, motion, and texture. The
shape encoding of a VOP provides a pixel map or a bitmap
of the object’s shape. The motion and texture encoding of a
VOP can be obtained in a manner similar to that used in
MPEG-2. A multiplexer is used to integrate and synchronize
the VOP data and composition information—position, orien-
tation, and depth—as well as other data associated with the
AVOs in a speciﬁed bitstream. MPEG-4 provides universal
accessibility supported by error robustness and resilience, es-
pecially in noisy environments at very low data rates (less than
64 Kbps): bit stream resynchronization, data recovery, and
error concealment. These features are particularly important
in mobile multimedia communication networks.
