Figure 5.15 shows an N-channel JFET with DC bias voltage applied. Just as for a simple
diode, the depletion region grows as the reverse bias across the PN junction is increased,
thereby constricting the cross section of the conducting N-channel material and increasing
the resistance of the channel. The major current ID in the channel is caused by the applied
voltage between the drain and source, VDS, and is controlled by the applied voltage between
the gate and source, VGS.
