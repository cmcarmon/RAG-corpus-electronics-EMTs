The capacitor discharges during the next 100 microseconds. The voltage across the resistor decreases 
at the same rate as the capacitor voltage and total voltage is maintained at 0. This exponential decrease in 
resistor voltage is shown during the second 100 microseconds in figure 4-41. The capacitor will discharge 
63.2 percent of its charge to a value of 23.3 volts at the end of the second 100 microseconds. The resistor 
voltage will rise in the positive direction to a value of âˆ’23.3 volts to maintain the total voltage at 0 volts.
