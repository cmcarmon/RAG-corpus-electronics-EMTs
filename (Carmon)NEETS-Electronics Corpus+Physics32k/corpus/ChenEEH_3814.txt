The numbers rl, l ¼ 1, . . . , L are referred to as the reconstruc-
tion levels of the quantizer, and tl, l ¼ 0, . . . , L are referred to as
its decision levels. A typical quantizer is depicted in Figure 4.9.
In many cases, the decision and reconstruction levels of a
quantizer are optimized such that the mean-squared error
between the quantizer’s input and output is minimized. This
is usually referred to as a Lloyd-Max quantizer (Jain, 1989). In
digital image processing, one often uses linear quantizers. For a
linear quantizer, the reconstruction and decision levels satisfy
the following relations:
