Notice the external shape of the planar tube in figure 2-13. The tube is composed of five sections, or
cylinders. As you go from the top to the bottom, each cylinder increases in diameter. Because of this piled
cylinder construction, the tube resembles a lighthouse, and is therefore known as a LIGHTHOUSE
TUBE.
