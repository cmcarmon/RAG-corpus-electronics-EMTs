Successive approximation
: An A/D  conversion  process  that  systematically  evaluates  the  analog  signal  in 
n
-bit digital code. The analog signal is successively compared to determine the digital
n
steps to produce an 
code, beginning with the determination of the most signiÔ¨Åcant bit of the code.
