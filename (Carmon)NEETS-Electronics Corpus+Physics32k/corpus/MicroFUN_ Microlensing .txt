Gravitational lensing is an effect of Einstein's general relativity, which says that all matter bends light that passes by it. Strong gravitational lensing drastically alters the shape of an object on the sky; weak gravitational lensing slightly alters the shape of the object; and gravitational microlensing alters only the brightness of the object, instead of its shape. Gravitational lensing in general, and especially microlensing, has had a vast impact on astronomy, specifically in the search for extrasolar planets.
If a planet orbiting a star passes within our line of sight to that star, it very slightly changes the brightness of the star. These changes can last a few hours or a few days. Astronomers can estimate the ratio of the planet's mass to the star's mass, as well as the radius of the planet's orbit around the star, by comparing actual brightness measurements to theoretical models.
Expensive equipment is required to detect a microlensing event, but because of the magnification, less sophisticated telescopic equipment can monitor the magnified area for changes in brightness caused by planets. Equipment that is now available has become more efficient at detecting microlensing events, but this equipment is in high demand for all sorts of astronomical observations and cannot be dedicated to monitoring these events for disruptions caused by planets.
Amateur astronomers have no access restriction to their equipment and can "follow up" on microlensing events that have been detected, therefore contributing to the discovery of several extrasolar planets. The short duration and unpredictable nature of disruptions during microlensing events require this kind of coverage, making amateur efforts very important to searching for extrasolar planets using microlensing. Î¼FUN facilitates the collaboration between amateur and professional astronomers that is necessary for the continued discovery of extrasolar planets.
