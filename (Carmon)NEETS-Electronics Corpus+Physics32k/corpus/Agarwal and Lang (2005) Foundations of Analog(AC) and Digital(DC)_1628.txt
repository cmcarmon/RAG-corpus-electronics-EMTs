i n v e r t e r The inverter shown in Figure 11.13 drives a load capacitor CL that
models the gate-to-source and interconnect capacitances of the immediate downstream
circuitry. We wish to approximate the average power dissipated in the inverter given
that the input voltage vIN is a 100-MHz square wave. In doing so, we assume that the
MOSFET on-state resistance RON satisfies RON (cid:5) RPU.
Since RON (cid:5) RPU, the output voltage rises much more slowly than it falls. The time
constant for the rising transient is RPUCL = 1 ns, which is much smaller than a half
period of the input square wave. Therefore, all inverter transients fully settle, and the
power dissipated in the inverter may be approximated as the sum of a static dissipation
plus a dynamic dissipation.
