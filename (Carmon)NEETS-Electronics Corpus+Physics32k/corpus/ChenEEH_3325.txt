sections are still valid. Dynamic models for generator units
models still must be introduced to understand system re-
sponse. Load dynamics are also important, particularly from
large induction motors, but such details are beyond the scope
here. This section focuses on the transient response of the
system over fractions of a second to oscillations over several
seconds and then up to slow dynamics that occur with voltage
problems over several minutes.
