values of the register with associated valid bits up to N clock
cycles. The current register is the register at the top of the FIFO
structure and always has the most recent value of the register. In
case of read or write (R/W) operations, the current register is
accessed. After each clock cycle, the data contained in this
register is pushed into the FIFO structure, and the correspond-
ing valid bit is set to value 1. The priority circuit ensures that the
pushing of an entry into this FIFO results in only the top
consecutive sequence of valid entries being pushed down by
one entry; entries following and including the ﬁrst invalid entry
do not move. To realize a microrollback of distance d, the dth
valid entry from the top of the FIFO is moved to the current
register, and the ﬁrst d entries in the FIFO are invalidated.
