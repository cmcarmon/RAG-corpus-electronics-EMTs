Equation A.1 says the line integral of the field around any closed path must
equal 0. Similarly, Equation A.2 says that the surface integral of the current
over any surface must be 0. Of course, Equations A.1 and A.2 are valid only
under the lumped matter discipline.
a → b, b → c, and c → a, as depicted in Figure A.10 we obtain
