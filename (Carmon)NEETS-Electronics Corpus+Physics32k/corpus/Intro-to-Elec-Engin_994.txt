The resulting coil voltage is thus a time function having the same sinusoidal waveform as
the spatial distribution B. The coil voltage passes through a complete cycle for each revolution
of the two-pole machine of Figure 12.2.1. So its frequency in hertz is the same as the speed of
the rotor in revolutions per second (r/s); that is, the electrical frequency is synchronized with the
mechanical speed of rotation. Thus, a two-pole synchronous machine, under normal steady-state
conditions of operation, revolves at 60 r/s, or 3600 r/min, in order to produce 60-Hz voltage. For
a P-pole machine in general, however, the coil voltage passes through a complete cycle every
time a pair of poles sweeps, i.e., P/2 times in each revolution. The frequency of the voltage wave
is then given by
