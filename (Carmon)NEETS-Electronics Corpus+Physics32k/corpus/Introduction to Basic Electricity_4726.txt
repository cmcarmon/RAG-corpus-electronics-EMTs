Any device that measures, stores, controls, calcu-
lates, or displays information has a microcontroller 
inside. In todayâ€™s society, microcontrollers con-
trol many appliances (e.g., microwaves, toasters, and 
stoves), operate high-tech toys, run the engines in au-
tomobiles, and play music in greeting cards. Many of 
the devices they control are taken for granted today.
