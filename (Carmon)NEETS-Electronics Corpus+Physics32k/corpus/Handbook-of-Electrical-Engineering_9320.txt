Modularity
With the tool of abstraction programs are made modular, that is, they are broken into fairly small, manageable
parts. Each part, called a module, consists of one or more procedures or functions and addresses a particular
detail  of  a  project.  A  module  may  consist  of  a  sorting  program,  a  package  for  matrix  or  time  and  date
calculations, a team of programs that preprocess input or format output, and the like.
