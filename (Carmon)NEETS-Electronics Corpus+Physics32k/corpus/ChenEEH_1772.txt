Another issue is that of protecting the intellectual copyrights
for different media components. For example, consider digital
movies that are distributed over the Internet using a pay-per-
view service. It is possible for any entrepreneur to download
such movies and sell them illegally. Digital watermarking tech-
niques (Su et al., 1999), which embed extra information into
multimedia data (such information is imperceptible to the
normal user (Su et al., 1999) as well as unremovable), can
help prevent copyright violations.
