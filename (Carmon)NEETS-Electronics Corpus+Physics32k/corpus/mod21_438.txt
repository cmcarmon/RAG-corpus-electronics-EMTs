The Hewlett-Packard Model 415E swr meter, shown in figure 4-3, is a commonly used swr meter. It
is extremely accurate, sensitive, lightweight, easy to use, and portable. It is essentially a high-gain, tuned
audio amplifier with a square-law meter that is calibrated to read swr directly. The meter is designed to be
operated at a mean center frequency of 1,000 hertz.
