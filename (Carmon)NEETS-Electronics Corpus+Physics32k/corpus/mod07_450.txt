The value of the filter capacitor (C1) must be relatively large to present a low opposition (XC) to the 
pulsating current and to store a substantial charge. The rate of the charge for the capacitor is limited by 
the low impedance of the ac source (the transformer), by the small resistance of the diode, and by the 
counter electromotive force (CEMF) developed by the coil. Therefore, the RC charge time constant is 
short compared to its discharge time. (This comparison in RC charge and discharge paths is illustrated in
