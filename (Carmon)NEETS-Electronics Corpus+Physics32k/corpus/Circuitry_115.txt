By moving one set of plates relative to the other, a 
capacitor  can  be  made  variable.  The  dielectric 
material  used in a  variable capacitor can be either 
air  (see  Fig.  2.34)  or  plastic  (the  latter  tend  to  be 
more  compact).  Typical  values 
for  variable 
capacitors  tend  to  range  from  about  25  pF  to  
500 pF. These components are commonly used for 
tuning radio receivers.
