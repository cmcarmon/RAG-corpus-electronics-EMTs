To see this, observe that the current source in Figure 2.37 applies the
current I to two parallel resistors, and that from Equation 2.85 these resistors
respond at their terminals with the common voltage v = v1 = v2 that is linearly
proportional to the current from the source. Thus, the resistors behave together
as a single resistor when viewed from their common terminals.
Let GP be the conductance of the parallel resistor pair. Then, from Equa-
tion 2.85, with the substitution of G1 ≡ 1/R1 and G2 ≡ 1/R2, and v = v1 = v2,
we can write
