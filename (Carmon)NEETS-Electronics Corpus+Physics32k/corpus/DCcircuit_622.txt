Applying Ohm’s Law vertically to those columns with unchanged (”same”) resistance val-
ues, we can tell what the current will do through those components. Increased voltage across
an unchanged resistance leads to increased current. Conversely, decreased voltage across an
unchanged resistance leads to decreased current:
