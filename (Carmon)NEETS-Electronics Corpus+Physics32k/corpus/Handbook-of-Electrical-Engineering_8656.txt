c.  The VAX compiler takes a totally different approach—a rather poor one, actually. It leaves not only
the byte in memory but even the pointer to the byte. Thus, every time it wants to refer to the byte—and
it does so numerous times—it must ﬁrst fetch the address from memory and then fetch the byte itself.
This double memory reference is what @4(ap) means: “At the address you will ﬁnd at address 4(ap).”
The only thing that makes all this apparent coming and going even remotely acceptable is that the
VAX will cache (place in a fast local memory) both the address and the character the ﬁrst time that
it gets them. Then, it can refer to them rapidly again. Cache references, however, are not as fast as
register references.
2.  Testing the character:
