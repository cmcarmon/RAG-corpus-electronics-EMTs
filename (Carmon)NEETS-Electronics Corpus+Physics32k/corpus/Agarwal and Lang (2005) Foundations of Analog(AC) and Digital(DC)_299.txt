Note that the polarity reversal of i2 and v2 has not changed the element law for the
resistor from Equation 2.18 because the element law for a linear resistor is symmetric
when the terminal variables are defined according to the associated variables convention.
The circuit also has the same two nodes and the same loop. The application of KCL at
