Figure 2.63 shows an idealized voltage-controlled current source (VCCS).
The device in the figure has four terminals. A pair of terminals serve as the con-
trol port and another pair of terminals are the output port. In many situations,
the control port is also called the input port. Figure 2.63 shows a labeling of the
branch variables at the output port vOUT and iOUT, and the branch variables
at the input port vIN and iIN. The value of the voltage vIN across its control
input port determines the value of the current iOUT through its output port. In
principle, such a dependent source can provide power, but for simplicity the
power terminals inherent to the source are not shown.
