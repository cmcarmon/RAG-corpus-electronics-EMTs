Between T3 and T4 input signal number one goes to zero while input signal number two goes
negative. This, again, causes a rapid change in the difference between the input signals. Halfway between
T3 and T4 (the dotted vertical line) the two input signals are equal in amplitude; therefore, the difference
between the input signals is 0 volts, and the output signal becomes 0 volts. From that point to T4, the
difference between the input signals becomes a positive voltage. At T4:
