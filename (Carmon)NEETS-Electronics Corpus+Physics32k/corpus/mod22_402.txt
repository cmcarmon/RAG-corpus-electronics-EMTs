When processing data, we think in terms of data files. For example, to process a parts inventory, you 
would need the master parts inventory file and the file that contains up-to-date information on each part 
that has been issued. The master parts inventory file would have a record for every part in the inventory. 
The update file, parts issued file, would have a record for each part issued. You would use a program to 
read the records on the parts issued file and update the matching records on the master parts inventory 
file. Depending on whether the data is stored on magnetic tape or disk or in internal storage, the program 
would use different methods to access storage to obtain the data. In the next section you'll learn about 
storage access methods.
