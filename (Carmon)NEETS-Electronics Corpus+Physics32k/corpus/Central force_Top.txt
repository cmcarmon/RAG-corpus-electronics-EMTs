In classical mechanics, a central force on an object is a force that is directed along the line joining the object and the origin:

r

^





{\displaystyle {\vec {F}}=\mathbf {F} (\mathbf {r} )=F(\mathbf {r} ){\hat {\mathbf {r} }}}

where







F

{\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\vec {\text{ F }}}}
is the force, F is a vector valued force function, F is a scalar valued force function, r is the position vector, ||r|| is its length, and








r

^






{\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\hat {\mathbf {r} }}}
= r/||r|| is the corresponding unit vector.
Not all central force fields are conservative nor spherically symmetric. However, it can be shown that a central force is conservative if and only if it is spherically symmetric.
