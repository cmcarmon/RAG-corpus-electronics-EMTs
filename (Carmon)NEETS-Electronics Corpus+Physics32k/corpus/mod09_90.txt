Now, if the designers do their very best (and they do) to keep the value of resistance in a practical 
series-RLC circuit LOW, then we can still get a fairly high current at resonance. The current is NOT 
"infinitely" high as in our ideal circuit, but is still higher than at any other frequency. The curve and 
vector relationships for the practical circuit are shown in figure 1-7.
