While several network architectures have been proposed for use as MANs, the two that are closest to widespread
commercial  implementation  are  Ô¨Åber-distributed  data  interface  (FDDI)  and  distributed  queue  dual  bus
(DQDB) interface. A key feature of a MAN is the ability to interconnect LANs. This is a problem because of
the high data rates at which LANs operate.
