Figure 3-51 shows a basic common-source amplifier circuit containing an N-channel JFET. The 
characteristics of this circuit include high input impedance and a high voltage gain. The function of the 
circuit components in this figure is very similar to those in a triode vacuum tube common-cathode 
amplifier circuit. C1 and C3 are the input and output coupling capacitors. R1 is the gate return resistor and 
functions much like the grid return resistor in a vacuum tube circuit. It prevents unwanted charge buildup 
on the gate by providing a discharge path for C1. R2 and C2 provide source self-bias for the JFET, which 
operates like cathode self-bias. R3 is the drain load resistor, which acts like the plate or collector load 
resistor.
