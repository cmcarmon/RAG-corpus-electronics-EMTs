Figure 13.3 shows a typical movement or trajectory of the
pendulum angle under an NDP controller for a successful
learning trial. The system under consideration is not subject
to any noise. Figure 13.4 represents a summary of typical
statistics of the learning process in histograms. It contains
vertical angle histograms when the system learns to balance
the cartâ€“pole using ideal state measurements without noise
corruption.
