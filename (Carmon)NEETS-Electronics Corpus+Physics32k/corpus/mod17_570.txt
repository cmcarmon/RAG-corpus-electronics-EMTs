and has the impedance characteristics of the antenna.) The dummy load is impedance matched to the pa. 
It allows testing of the pa without putting a signal on the air. When the equipment is in an operating 
mode, the dummy load is not used. The helix house is a small building physically separated from the 
transmitter location. It contains antenna loading, coupling, and tuning circuits. The main components 
consist of a HELIX (large coil) and variable inductors. The signal is fed from the helix directly to the 
antenna. Sometimes two antennas are used.
