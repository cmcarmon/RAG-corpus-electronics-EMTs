Under standard assumptions the body traveling along hyperbolic trajectory will attain in infinity an orbital velocity called hyperbolic excess velocity (




v

∞






{\displaystyle v_{\infty }\,\!}
) that can be computed as:





v

a








{\displaystyle v_{\infty }={\sqrt {\mu  \over {-a}}}\,\!}

where:




μ




{\displaystyle \mu \,\!}
is standard gravitational parameter,




a




{\displaystyle a\,\!}
is the negative semi-major axis of orbit's hyperbola.
The hyperbolic excess velocity is related to the specific orbital energy or characteristic energy by
