While	some	circuit	engineering	professors	teach	enough	lessons	about	electrical
safety,	others	are	quite	behind	on	the	area.	They	assume	that	practical	knowledge,
as	well	as	a	general	“be	careful”	would	suffice;	since	the	beginners	in	circuit
engineering	are	frequent	exposure	to	electrical	devices,	no,	the	statement	won’t	cut
it.	Therefore,	it	is	important	to	stress	out	the	need	to	be	careful	especially	during
their	first	hands-on	activity.
