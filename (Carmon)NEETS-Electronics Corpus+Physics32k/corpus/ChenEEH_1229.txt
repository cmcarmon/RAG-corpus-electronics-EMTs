for solving the SINO/NB problem: greedy-based shield inser-
tion (SI) algorithm, net ordering for minimizing Cx noise fol-
lowed by SI algorithm (NOÃ¾SI algorithm), graph-coloring
based SINO algorithm (SINO/GC algorithm), and simulated
annealing based SINO algorithm (SINO/SA algorithm). They
solved the SINO/NF problem by using the SINO algorithms
and setting the noise bound to zero. Note that the SINO/SA
always performs the best for any given setting. Lepak et al. have
extended this work by considering the RLC model.
