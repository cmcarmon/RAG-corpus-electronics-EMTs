Optical fibers are characterized by their structure and by their properties of transmission. Basically,
optical fibers are classified into two types. The first type is single mode fibers. The second type is
multimode fibers. As each name implies, optical fibers are classified by the number of modes that
propagate along the fiber. As previously explained, the structure of the fiber can permit or restrict modes
from propagating in a fiber. The basic structural difference is the core size. Single mode fibers are
manufactured with the same materials as multimode fibers. Single mode fibers are also manufactured by
following the same fabrication process as multimode fibers.
