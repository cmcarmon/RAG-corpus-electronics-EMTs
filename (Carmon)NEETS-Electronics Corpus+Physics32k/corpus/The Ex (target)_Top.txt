The Ex, also known as the Ex-Girlfriend, and now renamed to Alexa Zombie, is a mannequin produced by Zombie Industries to be a target for gun enthusiasts. The mannequin's name, and the fact that it spouted blood when shot, caused controversy. The target received attention after the National Rifle Association requested that Zombie Industries remove another target that resembled Barack Obama from a vendor booth at the organization's 2013 convention. It was criticized by domestic violence organizations, but the manufacturer claimed that it was not intended to promote violence against women.
