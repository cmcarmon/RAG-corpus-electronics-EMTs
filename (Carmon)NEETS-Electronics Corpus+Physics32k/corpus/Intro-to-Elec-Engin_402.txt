Two of the most important considerations that inﬂuence ampliﬁer design are power-handling
capacity and frequency response. In practice, the performance of an ampliﬁer is limited by its
ability to dissipate heat, known as its power dissipation. The electric power that is converted to
heat in an ampliﬁer can be calculated when the currents and voltages are known at all its terminals,
including the power-supply terminals.
