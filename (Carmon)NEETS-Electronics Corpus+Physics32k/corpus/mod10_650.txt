Before you look at the various types of antennas, consider the relationship between the wavelength at 
which the antenna is being operated and the actual length of the antenna. An antenna does not necessarily 
radiate or receive more energy when it is made longer. Specific dimensions must be used for efficient 
antenna operation.
