Step 2 requires applying power to the circuit to de-
termine whether an electrical problem exists. Depend-
ing on the type of circuit, indicators will light, sound 
will emit, and so on. If the circuit appears to perform 
properly, let the circuit warm up and settle in its normal 
operating mode. The purpose is to determine whether 
anything is defective with the circuit. If the circuit ap-
pears to be operating properly, then it can be calibrated 
or adjusted if required, and then move on to step 4.
