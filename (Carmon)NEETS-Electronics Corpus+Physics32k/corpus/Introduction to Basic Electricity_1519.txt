Cells and batteries can be connected together to in-
crease voltage and/or current. They can be connected 
in series, in parallel, or in series-parallel. In 
series, cells or batteries can be connected in either 
 series-aiding or series-opposing configurations. 
In a series-aiding configuration, the positive terminal 
of the first cell is connected to the negative terminal of 
the second cell; the positive terminal of the second cell 
is connected to the negative terminal of the third cell; 
and so on (Figure 12-18). In a series-aiding configu-
ration, the same current flows through all the cells or 
batteries. This can be expressed as
