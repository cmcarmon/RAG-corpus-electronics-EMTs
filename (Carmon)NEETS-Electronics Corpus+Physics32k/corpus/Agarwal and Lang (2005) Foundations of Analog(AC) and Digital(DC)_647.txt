One final note on notation before we work a few examples to illustrate the
small signal approach. For convenience, we will introduce the following nota-
tion to distinguish between total variables, their DC operating or bias values,
and their incremental excursions about the operating points. As illustrated in
Figure 4.40, we will denote total variables with small letters and capital sub-
scripts, DC operating point variables using all capitals, and incremental values
using all small letters. Thus, vD denotes the total voltage across the device, VD
the DC operating point, and vd = vD the incremental component. Since the
total variable is the sum of the two components, we have
