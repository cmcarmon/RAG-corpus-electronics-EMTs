When you want to trigger the operation of a circuit as a response to some-
thing physical happening (such as a change in temperature), you use elec-
tronic components known as sensors. Sensors take advantage of the fact 
that various forms of energy — including light, heat, and motion — can be 
converted into electrical energy. Sensors are a type of transducer, which is 
an electronic device that converts energy from one form to another. In this 
section, I describe some of the more common input transducers, or sensors, 
used in electronic circuits.
