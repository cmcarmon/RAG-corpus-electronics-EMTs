To account for this phenomenon, IDS has to be obtained
using velocity dependence on the electric Ô¨Åeld. A simple yet
intuitive model for IDS contains the original long channel drain
current expression in the linear regime (equation 18) divided
by a factor that accounts for velocity saturation. This formula
is written as:
