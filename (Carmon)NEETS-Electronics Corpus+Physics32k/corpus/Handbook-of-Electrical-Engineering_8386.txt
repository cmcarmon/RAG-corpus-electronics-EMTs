Graphical input and output is the topic of Chapter 91. Early promise in the mid-1960s led to the pessimistic
observation a decade later that this was “a solution looking for a problem,” but as computer display technology
improved  in  quality,  speed,  and,  most  importantly,  cost,  attention  was  focused  on  visualization  algorithms,
e.g.,  the  task  of  producing  a  two-dimensional  representation  of  a  three-dimensional  object.  This  is  coupled
with the need to provide a natural interface between the user and the computer and has led to the development
of interactive graphical techniques for drawing, pointing, etc., as well as consideration of the human factors
involved.
