Determination of Illuminance Levels
Among the many new concepts for lighting design, the ﬁrst to be discussed is the new method of determining
illuminance 
levels. In the past when illuminating engineers wanted to ﬁnd the recommended illuminance level
for a given task, they would look in the lighting handbook to ﬁnd a recommended level and then design an
illuminating system for the task using the value as a minimum. This procedure provides very little latitude for
ﬁne-tuning  an  illumination  design.  In  the  new  method,  a  more  comprehensive  investigation  of  required
illuminance is performed according to the following steps:
