The MOSFETs require continuous application of gate-source
voltage above the threshold voltage to be in an on-state mode.
The gate is isolated from the semiconductor by the oxide. Gate
current ï¬‚ows only during transition from on-to off-state and
vice versa when the gate capacitor charges or discharges. This
implies reduced power loss in the control circuit and simple gate
control. The switching transients are determined by the time
required to charge and discharge various capacitors in the
MOSFET structure. The capacitors appear where the gate
oxide overlaps the semiconductors and junction capacitance
because of the depletion layer, as indicated in Figure 7.12.
