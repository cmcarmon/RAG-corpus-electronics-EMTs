The rate, R, of performing basic steps in the processor is usually referred to as the processor clock rate; and
it is of the order of 100 to 200 million steps per second in current high-performance VLSI processors. This rate
is determined by the technology used in fabricating the processors, and is strongly related to the size or area
occupied by individual transistors. This size feature, which is currently in the submicron range, has been steadily
decreasing as fabrication techniques improve, allowing increases in R to be achieved.
