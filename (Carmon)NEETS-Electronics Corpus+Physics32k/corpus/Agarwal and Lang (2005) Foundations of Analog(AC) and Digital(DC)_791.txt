Now, suppose we wish to build a two-bit adder circuit (see Figure 5.44) that takes as
input a pair of two-bit positive integers A1A0 and B1B0, and a carry-in bit C0, and
produces a two-bit sum output S1S0 and a carry-out bit C1. Write a truth table and a
boolean expression for the carry-out bit in terms of the inputs.

Suppose we have two logic families named NTL and YTL. The
NTL family of logic gates operates under the static discipline with the following voltage
thresholds: VIL = 1.5 V, VOL = 1.0 V, VIH = 3.5 V, and VOH = 4 V. The YTL
is characterized by the voltage thresholds: VIL = 0.8 V,
family, on the other hand,
VOL = 0.3 V, VIH = 3.0 V, and VOH = 4.5 V. Will a YTL inverter driving the input of
