By integration of the equations of motion one obtains the curved world lines of accelerated bodies corresponding to a sequence of momentary inertial frames (here, the expression "curved" is related to the form of the worldlines in Minkowski diagrams, which should not be confused with "curved" spacetime of general relativity). In connection with this, the so-called clock hypothesis of clock postulate has to be considered: The proper time of comoving clocks is independent of acceleration, that is, the time dilation of these clocks as seen in an external inertial frame only depends on its relative velocity with respect to that frame. (See experimental confirmations of clock hypothesis.) Two simple cases of curved world lines are now provided by integration of equation (4a) for proper acceleration:
a) Hyperbolic motion: The constant, longitudinal proper acceleration

A classification of curved worldlines can be obtained by using the differential geometry of triple curves, which can be expressed by spacetime Frenet-Serret formulas. In particular, it can be shown that hyperbolic motion and uniform circular motion are special cases of motions having constant curvatures and torsions, satisfying the condition of Born rigidity. A body is called Born rigid, it the spacetime distance between its infinitesimally separated worldlines or points remains constant during acceleration.
