are usually employed only in machines designed for heavy overload or rapidly changing loads,
such as steel-mill motors subjected to reverse duty cycles or in motors intended to operate over
wide speed ranges by shunt-ﬁeld control. The schematic diagram of Figure 13.4.2 shows the
relative positions of various windings, indicating that the commutating and compensating ﬁelds
act along the armature axis (i.e., the quadrature axis), and the shunt as well as series ﬁelds act
along the axis of the main poles (i.e., the direct axis). It is thus possible to achieve rather complete
control of the air-gap ﬂux around the entire armature periphery, along with smooth sparkless
commutation.
