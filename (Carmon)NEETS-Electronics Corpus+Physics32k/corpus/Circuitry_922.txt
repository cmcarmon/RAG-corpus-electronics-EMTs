37. The output characteristics of a bipolar transistor 
are  shown  in  Fig.  A2.17.  If  the  transistor 
operates with VCC = 15 V, RL = 500 and IB = 40 
A determine (a) the quiescent value of collector-
emitter  voltage;  (b)  the  quiescent  value  of 
collector  current;  (c)  the  peak-peak  output 
voltage  produced  by  a  base  input  current  of  
40 ÂµA. [Page 146]
