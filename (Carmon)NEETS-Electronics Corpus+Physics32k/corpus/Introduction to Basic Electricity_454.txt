Creating a fully diverse workplace requires a lot of 
thought, effort, and action. Remember, each workplace is 
established through different sets of standards. Employees 
tend to align themselves with employees they are comfort-
able with. They choose characteristics in these employees 
that they want to enhance in themselves. These employ-
eesâ€™ unique characteristics make the workplace stronger.
