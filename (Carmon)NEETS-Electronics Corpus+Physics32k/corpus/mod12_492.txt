Another method of demodulating pdm is by the use of a low-pass filter. If the voltage of a pulse
waveform is averaged over both the pulse and no-pulse time, average voltage is the result. Since the
amplitude of pdm pulses is constant, average voltage is directly proportional to pulse width. The pulse
width varies with the modulation (intelligence) in pdm. Because the average value of the pulse train
varies in accordance with the modulation, the intelligence may be extracted by passing the width-
modulated pulses through a low-pass filter. The components of such a filter must be selected so that the
filter passes only the desired modulation frequencies. As the varying-width pulses are applied to the low-
