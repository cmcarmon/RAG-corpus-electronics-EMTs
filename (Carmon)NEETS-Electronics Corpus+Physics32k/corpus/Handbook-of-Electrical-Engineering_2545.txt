Since a single RC time constant is involved, the voltage gain of the CE stage will appear to fall at 6 dB/octave
as the frequency is reduced because more and more of the signal is dropped across C c. However, even if CE is very
large, it too will contribute to a fall in gain as it allows more and more of the output signal to be dropped across
uuXCE combination, this being applied also to the input loop, resulting in negative feedback. So, at very low
the R E
frequencies, the gain roll-off will tend to 12 dB/octave. The question therefore arises of how large CE should be,
and this can be conveniently answered by considering a second basic form of transistor connection as follows.
