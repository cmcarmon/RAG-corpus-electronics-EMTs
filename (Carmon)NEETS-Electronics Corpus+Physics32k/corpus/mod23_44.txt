In 1888, Oberlin Smith originated the idea of using permanent magnetic impressions to record
sounds. Then in 1900, Vladeniar Poulsen brought Mr. Smith’s dream to reality. At the Paris Exposition,
he demonstrated a Telegraphone. It was a device that recorded sounds onto a steel wire. Although
everyone thought it was a great idea, they didn’t think it would succeed since you had to use an earphone
to hear what was recorded. It wasn’t until 1925, when electronic amplifiers were developed, that magnetic
recording started to receive the attention it deserved.
