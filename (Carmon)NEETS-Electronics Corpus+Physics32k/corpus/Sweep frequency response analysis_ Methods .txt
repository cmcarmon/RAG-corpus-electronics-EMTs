The SFRA is a comparative method, meaning an evaluation of the transformer condition is done by comparing an actual set of SFRA results to reference results. Three methods are commonly used to assess the measured traces:
Time-based – current SFRA results will be compared to previous results of the same unit.
Type-based – SFRA of one transformer will be compared to an equal type of transformer.
Phase comparison – SFRA results of one phase will be compared to the results of the other phases of the same transformer.
