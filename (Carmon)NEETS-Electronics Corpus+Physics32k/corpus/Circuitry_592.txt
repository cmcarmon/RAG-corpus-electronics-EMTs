As an example, a signal at a frequency of 1 MHz 
will have a wavelength of 300 m whereas a signal 
at a frequency of 10 MHz will have a  wavelength 
of 30 m.  
  When  a  radio  wave  travels  in  a  cable  (rather 
than  in  air  or  ‘free  space’)  it  usually  travels  at  a 
speed that is between 60% and 80% of that of the 
speed of light.
