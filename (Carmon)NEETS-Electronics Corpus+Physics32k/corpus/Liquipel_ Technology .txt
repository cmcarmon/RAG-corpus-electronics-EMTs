Devices are placed in a machine that creates a vacuum and then injects super-hydrophobic particles onto the outside and inside of the devices. Plasma then binds the formulation onto the devicesâ€™ surfaces and circuits, creating a microscopic gap of air between the object and liquid. The entire process, from start to finish, takes approximately 30 minutes.
