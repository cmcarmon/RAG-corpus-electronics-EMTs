In most cases ssb generators operate at very low frequencies when compared with the normally
transmitted frequencies. For that reason, we must convert (or translate) the filter output to the desired
frequency. This is the purpose of the mixer stage. A second output is obtained from the frequency
generator and fed to a frequency multiplier to obtain a higher carrier frequency for the mixer stage. The
output from the mixer is fed to a linear power amplifier to build up the level of the signal for
transmission.
