We note, however, that this almost linear mode of operation of nonlinear
devices over a narrow operating range is more common with MOSFET circuits
(discussed in Chapter 8) than with nonlinear resistors. However, because of the
simplicity of nonlinear resistor circuits, we introduce the concept of incremental
analysis here, recognizing that the principal application will come later.
