sampled in space and, hence, travel slower than c, thereby
lagging behind the actual wavefront. While the jitter is most
pronounced along the grid axes f ¼ 0, 90, it is nonetheless
ﬁnite along f ¼ 45 despite the choice of S ¼
=2 (which
2
implies dispersionless propagation along grid diagonals).
