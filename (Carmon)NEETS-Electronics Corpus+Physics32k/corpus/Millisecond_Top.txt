A millisecond (from milli- and second; symbol: ms) is a thousandth (0.001 or 10−3 or 1/1000) of a second.
10 milliseconds (a hundredth of a second, 10−2) are called a centisecond.
100 milliseconds (one tenth of a second, 10−1) are called a decisecond.

To help compare orders of magnitude of different times, this page lists times between 10−3 seconds and 100 seconds (1 millisecond and one second). See also times of other orders of magnitude.
