PAL devices are available in a wide variety of sizes. Because there is a ﬁxed allocation of products to outputs
in  a  simple  PAL  device,  more  different  types  are  needed  than  in  the  case  of  PLAs.  This  limitation  has  lately
been overcome to some extent in some devices by allowing a limited allocation of products between adjacent outputs.
The ﬂexibility of PAL-structured PLAs can be enhanced by adding controllable three-state output drivers,
as shown in Fig. 81.44. The drivers, controlled by additional product terms (or control terms), allow those pins
to which they are connected to act as either inputs, outputs, or both. This feature allows a single device to be
used in a wider range of applications than would be possible with a device with a ﬁxed allocation of inputs
and outputs. Note also the polarity control, similar to that in the PLA of Fig. 81.42.
