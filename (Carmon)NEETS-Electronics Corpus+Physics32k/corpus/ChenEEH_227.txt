Many fundamental issues arise in the case of nonlinear circuits
concerning a solution’s existence, uniqueness, continuity,
boundedness, and stability. Mathematical
tools used to
address these issues and examine properties of nonlinear cir-
cuits range from purely numerical to geometric (Smale, 1972).
Brieﬂy addressed here are solutions to a circuit’s equations.
Described are several fundamental results concerning their
properties.
