The potential function is positive near positive charges, nega-
tive near negative charges, and in general tends to zero at
inÔ¨Ånity. The function is directly related to the energy stored
in the electrostatic system. The self-energy of a system of
charges in their own potential is contained in all of space
surrounding the system and is given by:
