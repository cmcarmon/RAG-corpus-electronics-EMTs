An  inverting  operational  amplifier  is  to  operate 
according to the following specification:  
 
Voltage gain = 100  
Input resistance (at mid-band) = 10 kG
Lower cut-off frequency = 250 Hz  
Upper cut-off frequency = 15 kHz  
 
Devise  a  circuit  to  satisfy  the  above  specification 
using an operational amplifier.  
 
Solution 
 
To  make  things  a  little  easier,  we  can  break  the 
problem  down  into  manageable  parts.  We  shall
