p r o b l e m 4.2
The circuit shown in Figure 4.55 contains two nonlinear devices
and a current source. The characteristics of the two devices are given. Determine the
voltage, v, for (a) iS = 1 A, (b) iS = 10 A, (c) iS = 1 cos (t).
p r o b l e m 4.3 A plot (hypothetical) of the v i characteristics, (terminal voltage
as a function of the current drawn out, and not its associated variables) for a battery is
shown in Figure 4.56(a).
