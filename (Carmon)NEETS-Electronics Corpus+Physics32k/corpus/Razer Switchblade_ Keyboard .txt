The famed component of the Switchblade is its revolutionary keyboard. The Switchblade's keyboard is standard to a 7-inch netbook, meaning that not a lot of keys are able to fit on the keyboard. However, each transparent plastic key has tiny OLED screens under it, similar to the idea conceptualized by the Optimus Maximus keyboard. Its dynamic interface changes keybinds depending on what game the user is playing. When a video game is executed, the Switchblade intelligently recognizes the game's interface, such as the controls, colour schemes, and command icons. It implements this information right into the keys itself, allowing for multiple profiles and setups for the same game. The user may choose which setup to use for different situations and remove keys that the user does not use. This adaptability compensates for the small number of keys on the Switchblade, allowing for a nearly infinite number of possible keyboard layouts.
