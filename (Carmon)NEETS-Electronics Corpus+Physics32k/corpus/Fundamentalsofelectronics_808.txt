implicitly through the
signal power and explicitly in the expression’s denominator. If the signal spectrum had a constant
amplitude as we increased the bandwidth, signal power would increase proportionally. On the other
hand, our transmitter enforced the criterion that signal amplitude was constant (Section 6.7). Signal
amplitude essentially equals the integral of the magnitude of the signal’s spectrum.
