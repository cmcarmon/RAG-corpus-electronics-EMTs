distributed  throughout  the  component  but  it  is 
convenient to treat the inductance and resistance as 
separate components in the analysis of the circuit. 
  To  understand  what  happens  when  a  changing 
current flows through an inductor, take a look at the 
circuit  shown  in  Fig.  2.37(a).  If  the  switch  is  left 
open,  no  current  will  flow  and  no  magnetic  flux 
will  be  produced  by  the  inductor.  If  the  switch  is 
closed, as shown in Fig. 2.37(b), current will begin 
to flow as energy is taken from the supply in order 
to  establish  the  magnetic  field.  However,  the 
change 
the 
appearance of current creates a voltage (an induced 
e.m.f.) across  the  coil  which  opposes  the  applied 
e.m.f. from the battery.  
  The  induced  e.m.f.  results  from  the  changing 
flux  and  it  effectively  prevents  an  instantaneous 
rise  in  current  in  the  circuit.  Instead,  the  current 
increases  slowly  to  a  maximum  at  a  rate  which 
depends  upon  the  ratio  of  inductance  (L)
to 
resistance 
circuit.  
  After  a  while,  a  steady  state  condition  will  be 
reached  in  which  the  voltage  across  the  inductor 
will have decayed to zero and the current will have 
reached a maximum value determined by the ratio 
of V to R (i.e. Ohmâ€™s Law). This is shown in Fig. 
2.37(c). 
 
If,  after  this  steady  state  condition  has  been 
achieved,  the  switch  is  opened,  as  shown  in  Fig. 
2.37(d),  the  magnetic  field  will  suddenly  collapse 
and the energy will be returned to the circuit in the 
form of an induced back  e.m.f. which will appear 
across  the  coil  as  the  field  collapses.  For  large 
values  of  magnetic  flux  and  inductance  this  back 
e.m.f. can be extremely large!
