If necessary, dc PSpice analysis is Ô¨Årst carried out to determine the
initial  conditions. Then  the  initial  conditions  are  used  in  the  transient
PSpice analysis  to  obtain  the  transient  responses.  It  is  recommended
but not necessary that during this dc analysis, all capacitors should be
open-circuited while all inductors should be short-circuited.
