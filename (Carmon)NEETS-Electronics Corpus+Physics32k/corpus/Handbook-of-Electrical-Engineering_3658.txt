A  ferromagnetic  or  ferrimagnetic  material,  on  being  heated,  suffers  a  reduction  of  its  magnetization  (per
unit  mass,  i.e., s,  and  per  unit  volume,  M).  The  slope  of  the  curve  of  Ms  vs.  T  increases  with  increasing
temperature  as  shown  in  Fig. 36.5.  This  ﬁgure  represents  the  conﬂict  between  the  ordering  tendency  of  the
exchange interaction and the disordering effect of increasing temperature. At the Curie temperature, the order
no longer exists and we have a paramagnetic material. The change from ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic materials
to paramagnetic is completely reversible on reducing the temperature to its initial value. Curie temperatures
are always lower than melting points.
