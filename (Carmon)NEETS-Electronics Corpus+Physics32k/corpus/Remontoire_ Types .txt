Remontoires are distinguished by their power source:
A gravity remontoire is one that uses a weight for power. It is used in precision pendulum clocks.
A spring remontoire uses a spring. It is the only type which can be used in watches, since the force of a weight would be disturbed by motions of the wearer's wrist
An electric remontoire can be either a gravity or spring type. In it, the weight or spring is rewound electrically, with a motor or solenoid. It is used in clocks with traditional mechanical movements which are run on electricity.
They can also be classified by where in the wheel train the remontoire is located:
An escapement remontoire applies its force directly to the escape wheel of the escapement. Spring remontoires were usually of this type.
A train remontoire applies its force to one of the wheels upstream from the escapement, usually to the wheel that drives the escape wheel.
