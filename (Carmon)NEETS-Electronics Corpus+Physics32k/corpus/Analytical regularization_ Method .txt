Analytical regularization proceeds as follows. First, the boundary value problem is formulated as an integral equation. Written as an operator equation, this will take the form




G
X
=
Y


{\displaystyle GX=Y}

with



Y


{\displaystyle Y}
representing boundary conditions and inhomogeneities,



X


{\displaystyle X}
representing the field of interest, and



G


{\displaystyle G}
the integral operator describing how Y is given from X based on the physics of the problem. Next,



G


{\displaystyle G}
is split into




G

1


+

G

2




{\displaystyle G_{1}+G_{2}}
, where




G

1




{\displaystyle G_{1}}
is invertible and contains all the singularities of



G


{\displaystyle G}
and




G

2




{\displaystyle G_{2}}
is regular. After splitting the operator and multiplying by the inverse of




G

1




{\displaystyle G_{1}}
, the equation becomes




X
+

G

1


−
1



G

2


X
=

G

1


−
1


Y


{\displaystyle X+G_{1}^{-1}G_{2}X=G_{1}^{-1}Y}

or




X
+
A
X
=
B


{\displaystyle X+AX=B}

which is now a Fredholm equation of the second type because by construction



A


{\displaystyle A}
is compact on the Hilbert space of which



B


{\displaystyle B}
is a member.
In general, several choices for





G


1




{\displaystyle \mathbf {G} _{1}}
will be possible for each problem.
