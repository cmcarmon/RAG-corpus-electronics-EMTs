where J, F, and TL represent, respectively, effective inertia, equivalent viscous friction, and
resultant load torque appearing at the motor shaft; K = KpKaKm, where Kp is the potentiometer
transducer constant (V/rad), Ka is the ampliﬁer gain factor (V/V), and Km is the motor-developed
torque constant (N·m/V) of the physical servomechanism shown in Figure 16.2.7; r is the input
command and c is the output displacement, both in radians.
