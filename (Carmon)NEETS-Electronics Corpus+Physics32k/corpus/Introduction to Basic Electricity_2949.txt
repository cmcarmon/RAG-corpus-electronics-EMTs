Silicon was discovered in 1823. It is found ex-
tensively in the earthâ€™s crust as a white or sometimes 
colorless compound, silicon dioxide. Silicon dioxide 
(silica) can be found abundantly in sand, quartz, agate, 
and flint. It is then chemically reduced to pure silicon 
in a solid form. Silicon is the most commonly used 
semiconductor material.
