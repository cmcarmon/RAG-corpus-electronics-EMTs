Material will expand or contract depending on the material's thermal expansion coefficient. As long as the material is free to move, the material can expand or contract freely without generating stresses. Once this material is attached to a rigid body at one end, thermal stresses can be created.This stress is calculated by multiplying the change in temperature, material's thermal expansion coefficient and material's young's modulus (see formula below). E is young's modulus, α is thermal expansion coefficient, To is temperature original, and Tf is the final temperature.
σ=Εα(To-Tf)=ΕαΔT
As the temperature increases the stress will be in compression due to the constraints, this is when Tf is greater than To. The opposite happens which cooling, when TF is less than To, the stress will be in tension.A welding example involves heating and cooling of metal which is a combination of thermal expansion, contraction, and temperature gradients. After a full cycle of heating and cooling, the metals left with residual stress around the weld.
