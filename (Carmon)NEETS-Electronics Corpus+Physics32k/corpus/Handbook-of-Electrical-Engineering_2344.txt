Commercially Available Packages
A number of circuit analysis software packages are commercially available, one of the most widely used being
SPICE. In this package, the BJT models are a combination of the Gummel–Poon and the modiﬁed Ebers–Moll
models. Figure 22.34 shows a common emitter transistor circuit and a SPICE input ﬁle containing the transistor
model. Some other available packages are SLIC, SINC, SITCAP, and Saber.
