For a simple example let m=1 and n=1. Consider a horizontal beam on which two points have been defined: point 1 and point 2. First we apply a vertical force P at point 1 and measure the vertical displacement of point 2, denoted




Δ

P
2




{\displaystyle \Delta _{P2}}
. Next we remove force P and apply a vertical force Q at point 2, which produces the vertical displacement at point 1 of




Δ

Q
1




{\displaystyle \Delta _{Q1}}
. Betti's reciprocity theorem states that:

{\displaystyle P\,\Delta _{Q1}=Q\,\Delta _{P2}.}
