Nearly all practical generators use electromagnetic poles instead of the permanent magnets used in 
our elementary generator. The electromagnetic field poles consist of coils of insulated copper wire wound 
on soft iron cores, as shown in figure 1-6. The main advantages of using electromagnetic poles are (1) 
increased field strength and (2) a means of controlling the strength of the fields. By varying the input 
voltage, the field strength is varied. By varying the field strength, the output voltage of the generator can 
be controlled.
