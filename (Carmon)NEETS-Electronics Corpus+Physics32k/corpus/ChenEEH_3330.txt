The armature will be modeled as a voltage controlled by the
rotor current behind a simple transient reactance as illustrated
in Figure 7.12. The induced voltage E0ï¬€u, referred to as the
voltage behind the reactance, is connected to the generator
0
terminal through the transient reactance x
d, where the sub-
script indicates a direct axis quantity and the superscript a
transient quantity.
