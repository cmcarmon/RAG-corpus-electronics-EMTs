Bipolar  transistors  operating  to  about  20  GHz  are  generally  fabricated  from  Si.  These  devices  are  easily
fabricated and low cost. They are useful in moderate gain and low to high RF power applications. The have
relatively high noise ﬁgure that varies from about 1 dB at 1 GHz to about 4–5 dB at 10 GHz.
