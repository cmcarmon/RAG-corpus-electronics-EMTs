The computer analyzes the image to identify the edges of the core and cladding. The centers rc and rg
of the core and cladding, respectively, are found. The cladding diameter is defined as the average
diameter of the cladding. The cladding diameter is twice the average radius (Rg). The core diameter is
defined as the average diameter of the core. The core diameter is twice the average core radius (Rc).
