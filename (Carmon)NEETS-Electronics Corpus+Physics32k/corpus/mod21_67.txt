Unlike the analog multimeter, the digital multimeter will measure ac current as well as dc current.
Again, current measurements are taken by breaking the current path and inserting the meter in series.
Regardless of whether you’re using an analog multimeter or digital multimeter, this procedure for
measuring current is time consuming. However, there is a major advantage to be gained by using the
digital multimeter — its high degree of accuracy. The Fluke 8000A digital multimeter, for example, is
accurate to within – 0.3% when measuring dc current and – 1% when measuring ac current. These
accuracies are representative of most medium-priced digital multimeters.
