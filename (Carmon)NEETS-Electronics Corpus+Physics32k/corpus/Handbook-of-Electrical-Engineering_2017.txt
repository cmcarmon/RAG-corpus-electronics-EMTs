Steerable Microphone Arrays
Steerable  microphone  arrays  have  controllable  directional  characteristics.  One  important  application  is  in
teleconferencing. Here, sound pickup can be highly degraded by reverberation and room noise. One solution
to this problem is to utilize highly directional microphones. Instead of pointing such a microphone manually
to a desired talker, steerable microphone arrays can be used for reliable automatic tracking of speakers as they
move around in a noisy room or auditorium, if combined with a suitable speech detection algorithm.
