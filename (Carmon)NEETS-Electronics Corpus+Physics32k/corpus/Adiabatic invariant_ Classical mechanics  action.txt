Suppose that a Hamiltonian is slowly time varying, for example, a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator with a changing frequency.

The action J of a classical orbit is the area enclosed by the orbit in phase space.

{\displaystyle J=\int _{0}^{T}p(t){dx \over dt}dt\,}

Since J is an integral over a full period, it is only a function of the energy. When the Hamiltonian is constant in time and J is constant in time, the canonically conjugate variable



θ


{\displaystyle \theta }
increases in time at a steady rate.

{\displaystyle {d\theta  \over dt}={\partial H \over \partial J}=H'(J)\,}

So the constant

{\displaystyle H'}
can be used to change time derivatives along the orbit to partial derivatives with respect to



θ


{\displaystyle \theta }
at constant J. Differentiating the integral for J with respect to J gives an identity that fixes

The integrand is the Poisson bracket of x and p. The Poisson bracket of two canonically conjugate quantities like x and p is equal to 1 in any canonical coordinate system. So

{\displaystyle 1=H'\int _{0}^{T}\{x,p\}dt=H'T\,}

and




H

{\displaystyle H'}
is the inverse period. The variable



θ


{\displaystyle \theta }
increases by an equal amount in each period for all values of J – it is an angle-variable.
Adiabatic invariance of J
The Hamiltonian is a function of J only, and in the simple case of the harmonic oscillator.





H
=

J



{\displaystyle \,H=\omega J\,}

When H has no time dependence, J is constant. When H is slowly time varying, the rate of change of J can be computed by re-expressing the integral for J

{\displaystyle {dJ \over dt}=\int _{0}^{2\pi }{\bigg (}{dp \over dt}{\partial x \over \partial \theta }+p{d \over dt}{\partial x \over \partial \theta }{\bigg )}d\theta \,}

Replacing time derivatives with theta derivatives, using



d

d
t



{\displaystyle d\theta =\omega dt\,}
and setting



ω
:=

{\displaystyle \omega :=1\,}
without loss of generality (



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }
being a global multiplicative constant in the resulting time derivative of the action), yields

So as long as the coordinates J,



θ


{\displaystyle \theta }
do not change appreciably over one period, this expression can be integrated by parts to give zero. This means that for slow variations, there is no lowest order change in the area enclosed by the orbit. This is the adiabatic invariance theorem – the action variables are adiabatic invariants.
For a harmonic oscillator, the area in phase space of an orbit at energy E is the area of the ellipse of constant energy,

{\displaystyle E={p^{2} \over 2m}+{m\omega ^{2}x^{2} \over 2}\,}

The x-radius of this ellipse is

{\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\sqrt {2E/\omega ^{2}m}}}

{\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\sqrt {2mE}}}
