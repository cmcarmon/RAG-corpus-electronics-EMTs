 As you have seen, several factors can affect the inductance of a coil, and all of these factors are 
variable. Many differently constructed coils can have the same inductance. The important information to 
remember, however, is that inductance is dependent upon the degree of linkage between the wire 
conductor(s) and the electromagnetic field. In a straight length of conductor, there is very little flux 
linkage between one part of the conductor and another. Therefore, its inductance is extremely small. It 
was shown that conductors become much more inductive when they are wound into coils. This is true 
because there is maximum flux linkage between the conductor turns, which lie side by side in the coil.
