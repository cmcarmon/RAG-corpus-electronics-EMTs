In case of conservative body forces, ∇ × B = 0.
For a barotropic fluid, ∇ρ × ∇p = 0. This is also true for a constant density fluid (including incompressible fluid) where ∇ρ = 0. Note that this is not the same as an incompressible flow, for which the barotropic term cannot be neglected.
For inviscid fluids, the viscosity tensor τ is zero.
Thus for an inviscid, barotropic fluid with conservative body forces, the vorticity equation simplifies to
