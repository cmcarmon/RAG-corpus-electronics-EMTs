TAPE-TO-HEAD SEPARATION—(1) Separation.—The separation between a magnetic head
and the magnetic tape caused by the (a) foil-bearing effect, (b) improper head contour, which
generates standing waves in the tape, and (c) surface roughness of the tape. These conditions
are interrelated and are greatly influenced by tape tension and tape compliancy. In a properly
designed system, tape roughness is the limit of head-to-tape separation, usually <10 fm.
(2) Changes.—(a) Head contamination is the debris attached to the head, which causes the
tape to lift away from the head, forming a tent-like deformation of the tape. This tent does
not move or change shape until the contamination is removed. (b) Tape contamination
includes particles attached to the tape, resulting in a tent that moves across the head with the
tape. (3) Effective.—(a) The actual distance from the magnetic storage material on the tape
to the top of the active magnetic core material at the read or write gape. (b) The effective
