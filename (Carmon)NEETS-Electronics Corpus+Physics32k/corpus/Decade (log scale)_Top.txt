One decade (symbol dec) is a unit for measuring frequency ratios on a logarithmic scale, with one decade corresponding to a ratio of 10 between two frequencies (an order of magnitude difference). It is especially useful when referring to when describing frequency response of electronic systems, such as audio amplifiers and filters.
A closely related unit is the octave, which corresponds to a ratio of 2 between two frequencies.
