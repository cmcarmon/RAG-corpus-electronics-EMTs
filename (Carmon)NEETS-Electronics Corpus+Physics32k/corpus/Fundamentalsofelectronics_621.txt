Figure 5.15: The top waveform is a segment 1024 samples long taken from the beginning of the “Rice
University” phrase. Computing Figure 5.14 involved creating frames, here demarcated by the vertical
lines, that were 256 samples long and ﬁnding the spectrum of each. If a rectangular window is applied
(corresponding to extracting a frame from the signal), oscillations appear in the spectrum (middle of
bottom row). Applying a Hanning window gracefully tapers the signal toward frame edges, thereby
yielding a more accurate computation of the signal’s spectrum at that moment of time.
