wire-wound  resistors.  Depending  on  the  application,  ﬁxed  resistors  are  manufactured  as  precision  resistors,
semiprecision  resistors,  standard  general-purpose  resistors,  or  power  resistors.  Precision  resistors  have  low
voltage and power coefﬁcients, excellent temperature and time stabilities, low noise, and very low reactance.
These resistors are available in metal-ﬁlm or wire constructions and are typically designed for circuits having
very close resistance tolerances on values. Semiprecision resistors are smaller than precision resistors and are
primarily used for current-limiting or voltage-dropping functions in circuit applications. Semiprecision resistors
have long-term temperature stability. General-purpose resistors are used in circuits that do not require tight
resistance tolerances or long-term stability. For general-purpose resistors, initial resistance variation may be in
the neighborhood of 5% and the variation in resistance under full-rated power may approach 20%. Typically,
general-purpose resistors have a high coefﬁcient of resistance and high noise levels. Power resistors are used
for power supplies, control circuits, and voltage dividers where operational stability of 5% is acceptable. Power
resistors are available in wire-wound and ﬁlm constructions. Film-type power resistors have the advantage of
stability at high frequencies and have higher resistance values than wire-wound resistors for a given size.
