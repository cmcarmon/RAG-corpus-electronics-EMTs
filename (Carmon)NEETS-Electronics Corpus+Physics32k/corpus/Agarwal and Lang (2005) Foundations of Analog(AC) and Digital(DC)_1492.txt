Let us now compute tr. As defined earlier, tr is the time taken for the
clock signal to rise from VOL to VOH. The equivalent circuit for computing tr
is suggested in Figure 10.46. The circuit shows the equivalent capacitor being
charged by the supply VS through the RL and Rwire resistances. Let us denote
Req = RL + Rwire. The initial voltage on the capacitor VC0 = VOL.
