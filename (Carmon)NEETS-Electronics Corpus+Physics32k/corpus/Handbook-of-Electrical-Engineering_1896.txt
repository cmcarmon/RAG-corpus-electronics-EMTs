The ability to mix multimedia instructions with other instructions on a standard microprocessor is the clear
advantage of instruction set extensions. These extensions are very well-suited to the implementation of complex
algorithms because the microprocessor can efÔ¨Åciently execute the nonlinear algebra operations as well as the
highly parallel video operations. Furthermore, instruction set extensions take advantage of the huge resources
available to microprocessor manufacturers to build high-performance chips.
