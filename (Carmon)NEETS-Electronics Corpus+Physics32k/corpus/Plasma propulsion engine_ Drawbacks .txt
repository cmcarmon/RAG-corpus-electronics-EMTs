For some plasma thruster technologies, such as Berkant Goskel's tiny plasma thruster, one of the largest problems is generating enough electricity to turn gases into plasma. This same problem plagues Diaz's VASIMR thruster. Diaz's device would need so much electricity, that any vehicle that uses a VASIMR engine would also need several nuclear reactors in order to generate enough power. Not only would the reactors add mass to the payload, this has caused concern by some who fear the possible fallout caused by an explosion of the reactor. Because of this possibility, NASA has previously stopped research in nuclear reactors that could be sent up into space.
Another common issue plasma rockets have run into is the possibility of the rocket breaking itself. Over time, the plasma these rockets produce will damage the walls of the device ultimately causing it to break. This means that on a mission to Mars, it is possible that the rocket will destroy itself.
Lastly, due to their low thrust, plasma engines are not suitable for sending large payloads into space. On average, these rockets provide about 2 pounds of thrust maximum. This is a problem since in order to be financially efficient, heavy payloads need to be sent up every time a mission is scheduled. While plasma engines could take over once in space, chemical rockets would be needed to launch the vehicle.
