Note that the range on the potentiometer is approximate. If the potenti­
ometer lacks markings, use a multimeter (set to ohms) to figure out the 
component’s value. You can also use a multimeter to measure the variable 
resistance between the center terminal and either end terminal. (Chapter 16 
explains in detail how to test resistances using a multimeter.)
