13.2.24 A three-phase, 440-V, 60-Hz, four-pole induction
motor operates at a slip of 0.025 at full load, with
its rotor circuit short-circuited. This motor is to
be operated on a 50-Hz supply so that the air-gap
ï¬‚ux wave has the same amplitude at the same
torque as on a 60-Hz supply. Determine the 50-
Hz applied voltage and the slip at which the motor
will develop a torque equal to its 60-Hz full-load
value.
