induced barrier lowering (DIBL). Figure 3.15 shows the vari-
ation of surface potential from source to drain for a short
channel and a long channel MOSFET. As shown, for the
long channel device, the potential is nearly constant through-
out the channel and is determined only by the gate bias.4 The
height of the potential barrier for electrons at the source end is
given by:
