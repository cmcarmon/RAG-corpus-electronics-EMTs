A high positive potential on the anodes pulls electrons through the hole in the grid. Because the grid
is near the cathode, it can control the number of electrons that are emitted. As in an ordinary electron
tube, the negative voltage of the grid can be varied either to control electron flow or stop it completely.
The brightness (intensity) of the image on the fluorescent screen is determined by the number of electrons
striking the screen. This is controlled by the voltage on the control grid.
