Another problem encountered in measuring ac is that the meter movement reacts to the average value
of the ac. The value used when working with ac is the effective value (rms value). Therefore, a different
scale is used on an ac meter. The scale is marked with the effective value, even though it is the average
value to which the meter is reacting. That is why an ac meter will give an incorrect reading if used to
measure dc.
