Iterative Method
Many iterative techniques have been proposed. Here, we emphasize one of these techniques called simulated
annealing.  Simulated  annealing,  as  proposed  by  Kirkpatrick  et al.  [1983],  makes  the  connection  between
statistical mechanics and combinatorial optimization problems. The main advantage with simulated annealing
is its hill-climbing ability, which allows it to back out of inferior local solutions and Ô¨Ånd better solutions.
