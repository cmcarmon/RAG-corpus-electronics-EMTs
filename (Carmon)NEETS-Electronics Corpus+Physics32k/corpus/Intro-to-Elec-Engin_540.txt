Figure 6.2.3(a) shows the block diagram of a 4-to-1 multiplexer. The truth table is given in
Figure 6.2.3(b). Notice that each of the four inputs (I0, I1, I2, and I3) is selected by S1 and S0,
and directed to the output Q. In general, only the input whose address is given by the select lines
is directed to the output. The logic diagram is shown in Figure 6.2.3(c). 2-, 4-, 8-, and 16-to-1
multiplexers are commercially available as MSI packages.
