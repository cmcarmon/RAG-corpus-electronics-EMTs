Voltmeters, for example, can be of either analog or digital (digital voltmeter, or DVM)
variety. While the speedometer of a car is an analog device, the odometer (which records miles
or kilometers) is digital because it records changes in units of one-tenth of a mile or kilometer. A
toggle switch which is either on or off is digital, whereas the dimmer switch is analog because it
allows the light intensity to be varied in a continuous way.
