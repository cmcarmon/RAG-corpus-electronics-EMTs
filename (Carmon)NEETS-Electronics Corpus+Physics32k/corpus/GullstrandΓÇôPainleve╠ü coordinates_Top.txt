Gullstrand–Painlevé coordinates are a particular set of coordinates for the Schwarzschild metric – a solution to the Einstein field equations which describes a black hole. The time coordinate follows the proper time of a free-falling observer who starts from far away at zero velocity, and the spatial slices are flat. There is no coordinate singularity at the Schwarzschild radius (event horizon).
The solution was proposed independently by Paul Painlevé in 1921  and Allvar Gullstrand in 1922. It was not recognized until 1933 in Lemaître's paper  that these solutions were simply coordinate transformations of the usual Schwarzschild solution.
