2. Testing logic that is upstream from the RAM block (i.e., outputs from logic circuit are captured by the
RAM block) is difÔ¨Åcult since the observation point is the RAM block. That is, it is necessary to access
the  RAM  block  in  order  to  observe  the  test  results.  This  problem  might  be  solved  by  improving  the
observability  of  the  RAM  inputs  and/or  making  the  RAM  outputs  more  easily  observable  as  well  as
providing  the  bypass  capability.  This  way,  inputs  to  the  RAM  might  be  bypassed  directly  to  the  RAM
outputs where they may be observed. This may require adding an observe-only register to capture the
RAM outputs.
