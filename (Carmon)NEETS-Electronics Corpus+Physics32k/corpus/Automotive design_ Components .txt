Integration of an automobile involves fitting together separate parts to form a monocoque body or units and mounting these onto a frame, the chassis.
An automobile chassis basically comprises the following:
The body shell, which forms the skeleton of the vehicle.
The engine, is the power unit of the vehicle; which in the past has been in large part, the internal combustion engine.
Transmission system, which aids in transferring the drive from the engine to the wheels. Its main components are the clutch, gearbox, final drive, and differential.
Suspension system, which is used to connect the wheels to the body or chassis frame.
Steering
Brakes
Electrical equipment
The chassis is complete in itself as a road vehicle. It can drive and control itself just as in case of a complete car and therefore, in many motor works, the chassis is usually tested on the road before the complete body of the vehicle is attached as the chassis alone can behave as the propulsion means.
