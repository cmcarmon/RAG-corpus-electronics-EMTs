where R represents resistance, V represents voltage, 
and I represents current. 
 
Proportionality 
 
In electronic circuits, when one quantity changes it 
normally affects a number of other quantities. For 
example, if the output voltage produced by a power 
supply increases when the resistance of the load to 
which it is connected remains constant, the current 
supplied to the load will also increase. If the output 
voltage  doubles,  the  current  will  also  double  in 
value. If, on the other hand, the output voltage falls 
by  50%  the  current  will  also  fall  by  50%.  To  put 
this  in  a  mathematical  way  we  can  say  that 
(provided that load resistance remains constant): 
 
load  current  is  directly  proportional  to  output 
voltage  
 
Using  mathematical  notation  and  symbols 
represent the quantities, we would write this as:
