Views B and C of figure 3-26 show the voltage and current distribution along a transmission line at a
point about 1/8 after a maximum voltage or current reaches the end of the line. Since the instantaneous
values are continuously changing during the generation of a complete cycle, a large number of these
pictures are required to show the many different relationships.
