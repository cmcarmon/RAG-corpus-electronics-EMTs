The constant B is called the luminance or photometric brightness of the source. Its units are candles per square
meter (1 stilb = p lamberts) and dE is the luminous ﬂux in lumens. The total illumination E of the surface
element is calculated by integrating over the source. The illuminance or ﬂux density on the surface is thus
