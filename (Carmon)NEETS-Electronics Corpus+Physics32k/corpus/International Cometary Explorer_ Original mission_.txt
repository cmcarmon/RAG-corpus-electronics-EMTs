ISEE-3 carries no cameras; instead, its instruments measure energetic particles, waves, plasmas, and fields.
ISEE-3 originally operated in a halo orbit about the L1 Sun-Earth Lagrangian point, 235 Earth radii above the surface (about 1.5 million km, or 924,000 miles). It was the first artificial object placed at a so-called "libration point", entering orbit there on November 20, 1978, proving that such a suspension between gravitational fields was possible. It rotates at 19.76 rpm about an axis perpendicular to the ecliptic, to keep it oriented for its experiments, to generate solar power and to communicate with Earth.
The purposes of the mission were:
to investigate solar-terrestrial relationships at the outermost boundaries of the Earth's magnetosphere;
to examine in detail the structure of the solar wind near the Earth and the shock wave that forms the interface between the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere;
to investigate motions of and mechanisms operating in the plasma sheets; and,
to continue the investigation of cosmic rays and solar flare emissions in the interplanetary region near 1 AU.
