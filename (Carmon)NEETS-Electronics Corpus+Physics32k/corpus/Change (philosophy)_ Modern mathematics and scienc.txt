Modern mathematics has developed a rigorous approach to dealing with change, which addresses Zeno's paradoxes of motion in particular. Infinite series with finite sums have been given a rigorous treatment in the subject of mathematical analysis, and the concepts of motion and infinitesimal quantities of time and space are understood through the calculus.
In physics, although a number of conservation laws such as the conservation of energy have been discovered, phenomena such as the creation and destruction of matter cast empirical doubt upon Parmenides' claim that something cannot come from or become nothing.
Never disproven theory of relativity by Albert Einstein explains how time is a result of change, in contradiction to the idea that change occurs in time. This point of view makes it easier to understand direction of time, as in reality time is a perception of the order of change seen from a point of view. In other words it is a relation between objects rather than an object.
