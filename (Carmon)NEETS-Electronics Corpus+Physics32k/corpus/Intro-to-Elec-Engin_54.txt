The SI unit of current is the ampere (A), which represents 1 coulomb per second. In most
metallic conductors, such as copper wires, current is exclusively the movement of free electrons
in the wire. Since electrons are negative, and since the direction designated for the current
is that of the net positive charge movement, the charges in the wire are thus moving in the
direction opposite to the direction of the current designation. The net charge transferred at a
particular time is the net area under the currentâ€“time curve from the beginning of time to the
present,
