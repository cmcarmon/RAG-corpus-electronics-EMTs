A LIGHT-EMITTING DIODE (LED) is a semiconductor device that emits incoherent light,
through spontaneous emission, when a current is passed through it. The basic LED types used for fiber
optic communication systems are the SURFACE-EMITTING LED (SLED), the EDGE-EMITTING
LED (ELED), and the SUPERLUMINESCENT DIODE (SLD).
