the basic requirement is that the gate-to-channel bias voltage at the
drain end of the channel, VGD , be greater than the pinch-off voltage
VP . For the example under consideration with VP = –4 V, this means
that  VGD =  VGS – VDS must be more negative than  –4 V. Therefore,
VDS –  VGS ‡ +4 V. Thus, for  VGS = 0, the active region will begin at
VDS = +4 V. When  VGS = –1 V, the active region will begin at VDS =
+3 V, for now VGD = –4 V. When VGS = –2 V, the active region begins
at VDS = +2 V, and when VGS = –3 V, the active region begins at VDS
= +1 V. The dotted line in Fig. 24.6 marks the boundary between the
nonsaturated and active regions.
