The remaining bit is shifted into the register by CP5. FF1 remains set, FF2 sets, FF3 resets, and FF4
sets. At this point, the serial transfer is complete. The binary word can be sampled on the parallel output
lines. Once the parallel data is transferred, a CLEAR pulse resets the FFs (CP6), and the register is ready
to input the next word.
