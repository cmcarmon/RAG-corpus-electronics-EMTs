Linear ﬁltering is one of the most powerful image enhance-
ment methods. It is a process in which part of the signal
frequency spectrum is modiﬁed by the transfer function of
the ﬁlter. In general, the ﬁlters under consideration are linear
and shift-invariant, and thus, the output images are character-
ized by the convolution sum between the input image and the
ﬁlter impulse response; that is:
