POWER-AMPLIFIER TRANSMITTERS are used in many recently developed radar sets. This type
of transmitter was developed because of the need for more stable operation of the moving target indicator
(mti). In a magnetron transmitting system, the high-power magnetron oscillator has a tendency to drift in
frequency because of temperature variations, changes in the modulating pulse, and various other effects.
