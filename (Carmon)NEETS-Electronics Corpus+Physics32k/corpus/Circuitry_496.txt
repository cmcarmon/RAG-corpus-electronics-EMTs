Example 10.7 
 
Show how a 4001UBE device (see Fig. 10.32) can 
be  connected  to  form  a  simple  cross-coupled 
bistable.  Sketch  a  circuit  diagram  showing  pin 
connections and include LEDs that will indicate the 
output state of the bistable. 
 
Solution 
 
See Practical investigation on Page 195. Note that 
only two of the four logic gates have been used.
