Lift coefficient
Thrust specific fuel consumption the lift to drag determines the required thrust to maintain altitude (given the aircraft weight), and the SFC permits calculation of the fuel burn rate
thrust to weight ratio
Range (aircraft) range depends on the lift/drag ratio
Inductrack maglev has a higher lift/drag ratio than aircraft at sufficient speeds
Gravity drag rockets can have an effective lift to drag ratio while maintaining altitude
