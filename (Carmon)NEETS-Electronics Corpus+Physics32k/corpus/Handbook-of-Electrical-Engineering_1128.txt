Techniques for the design of IIR analog ﬁlters are well established. For this reason, the most important class
of IIR digital ﬁlter design techniques is based on forcing a digital ﬁlter to behave like a reference analog ﬁlter.
This can be done in several different ways. For example, if the analog ﬁlter impulse response is ha(t) and the
digital ﬁlter impulse response is h(n), then it is possible to make h(n) = ha(nT), where T is the sample spacing
of the digital ﬁlter. Such designs are referred to as impulse-invariant [Parks and Burrus, 1987]. Likewise, if ga(t)
is the unit step response of the analog ﬁlter and g(n) is the unit step response of the digital ﬁlter, it is possible
to make g(n) = ga(nT), which gives a step-invariant design [Parks and Burrus, 1987].
