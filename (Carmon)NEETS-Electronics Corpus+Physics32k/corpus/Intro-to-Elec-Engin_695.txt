7.2.4 A silicon diode is forward-biased with V = 0.5
V at a temperature of 293 K. If the diode current
is 10 mA, calculate the saturation current of the
diode.
7.2.5 With V = 50 mV, a certain diode at room tem-
perature is found to have I = 16 µA and satisﬁes
I = IS (e40V − 1). Find the corresponding diffu-
sion current.
