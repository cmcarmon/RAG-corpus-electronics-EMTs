FLOWCHART WORKSHEET.Â—The flowchart worksheet is a means of standardizing 
documentation. It provides space for drawing programming flowcharts and contains an area for 
identification of the job, including application, procedure, date, and page numbers (fig. 3-5). You may 
find it helpful when you develop flowcharts. If you don't have this form available, a plain piece of paper 
will do.
