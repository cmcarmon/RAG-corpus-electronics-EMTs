The drain-to-source resistance rds will have a temperature coefﬁcient (TC) due to two causes: (1) the variation
of the channel resistivity with temperature and (2) the temperature variation of VP . The TC of the channel resistivity
is positive, whereas the TC of VP is negative due to the negative TC of the contact potential f. The positive TC of
the channel resistivity will contribute to a positive TC of rds. The negative TC of VP will contribute to a negative
TC of rds. At small values of VGS , the dominant contribution to the TC is the positive TC of the channel resistivity,
so rds will have a positive TC. As VGS gets larger, the negative TC contribution of VP becomes increasingly important,
and  there  will  be  a  value  of  VGS  at  which  the  net  TC  of  rds  is  zero,  and  above  this  value  of  VGS  the  TC  will  be
negative.  The  TC  of  rds(on)  is  typically  +0.3%/(cid:176)C  for n-channel  JFETs  and  +0.7%/(cid:176)C  for  p-channel  JFETs.  For
example, for a typical JFET with an rds(on) = 500 W at 25(cid:176)C and VP = 2.6 V, the zero TC point will occur at VGS =
2.0 V. Any JFET can be used as a VVR, although there are JFETs that are speciﬁcally made for this application.
