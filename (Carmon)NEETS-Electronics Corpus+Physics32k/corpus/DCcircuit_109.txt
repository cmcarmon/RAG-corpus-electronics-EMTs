referring to ”excess” charge. You see, the terms ”positive” and ”negative” are human inventions,
and as such have no absolute meaning beyond our own conventions of language and scientiﬁc
description. Franklin could have just as easily referred to a surplus of charge as ”black” and a
deﬁciency as ”white,” in which case scientists would speak of electrons having a ”white” charge
(assuming the same incorrect conjecture of charge position between wax and wool).
