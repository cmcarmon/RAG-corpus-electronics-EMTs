^xx (k, i)
(usually just the diagonal elements) are compared to
identify which of the q error sources is dominant at any
time k. Identiﬁcation of the dominant sources allows the
sensor or model development efforts to focus on the most
effective directions. Identiﬁcation of insigniﬁcant error
sources motivates areas of possible cost savings through
either the elimination of sensors or the purchase of lower
cost sensors.
