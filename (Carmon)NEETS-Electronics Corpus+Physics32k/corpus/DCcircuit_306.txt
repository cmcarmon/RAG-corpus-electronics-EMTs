For those who are left-handed, this advice may not be the best. If such a person is sufﬁ-
ciently uncoordinated with their right hand, they may be placing themselves in greater danger
by using the hand they’re least comfortable with, even if shock current through that hand
might present more of a hazard to their heart. The relative hazard between shock through one
hand or the other is probably less than the hazard of working with less than optimal coordina-
tion, so the choice of which hand to work with is best left to the individual.
