The roughness coefﬁcient rs takes care of the fact that the earth’s surface is not sufﬁciently smooth to produce
specular (mirrorlike) reﬂection except at a very low grazing angle. The earth’s surface has a height distribution
that is random in nature. The randomness arises out of the hills, structures, vegetation, and ocean waves. It is
found that the distribution of the heights of the earth’s surface is usually the Gaussian or normal distribution
of  probability  theory.  If  sh is  the  standard  deviation  of  the  normal  distribution  of  heights,  we  deﬁne  the
roughness parameters
