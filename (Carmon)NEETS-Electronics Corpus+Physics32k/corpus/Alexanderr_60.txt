Born of humble beginnings in Erlangen, Bavaria, Ohm threw him-
self  into  electrical  research.  His  efforts  resulted  in  his  famous  law.
He was  awarded  the  Copley  Medal  in  1841  by  the  Royal  Society  of
London.  In  1849,  he  was  given  the  Professor  of  Physics  chair  by  the
University of Munich. To honor him, the unit of resistance was named
the ohm.
