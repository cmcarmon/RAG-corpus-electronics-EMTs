other in vitro experiments showing effects on enzyme activity at the cell surface by ELF sinusoidal ﬁelds between
5 (10–4) V/m and 30 V/m [Blank, 1992]. Related experiments at higher ﬁeld intensities and the theory of ﬁeld
effects on catalysis [Robertson and Astumian, 1991] also show that electric ﬁeld action at the exterior of the
cell surface can be translated via enzyme-catalyzed chemical reactions to the cell interior.
