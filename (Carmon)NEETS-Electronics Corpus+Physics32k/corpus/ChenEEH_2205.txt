No ﬁeld in equations 2.1 and 2.2 can be considered more
‘‘fundamental’’ than the others; each plays a unique part in
the dynamics of electromagnetic and electrostatic systems. In
particular, when dealing with electrostatics, the distinction
between D and E should never be blurred. The practical fact
that the constitutive properties of dielectric matter vary in
space prevents the moving of the permittivity function, e,
through the vector differential operators of equations 2.2a
and 2.2c as if it were a constant. Therefore, the following two
expressions are, in general, inequalities. They only become
equalities inside homogeneous regions of space.
