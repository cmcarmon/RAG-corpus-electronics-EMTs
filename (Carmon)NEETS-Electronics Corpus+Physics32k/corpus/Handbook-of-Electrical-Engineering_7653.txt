Another approach to active devices is to combine lasers/modulators with electronics and photodiodes as has
been proposed for optical interconnections of electronic circuits. Since the logic function is implemented with
electronic circuitry, any relatively complex functionality can be achieved. Several examples of logic gates have
been made using GaAs circuitry and light-emitting diodes. Again surface-emitting microlasers provide an ideal
emitter  for  this  purpose,  because  of  their  small  size  and  low  threshold  current.  However,  the  integration  of
these lasers with the required electrical components has yet to be demonstrated.
