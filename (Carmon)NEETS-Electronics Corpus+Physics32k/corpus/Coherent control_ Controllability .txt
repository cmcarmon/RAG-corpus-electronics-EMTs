Coherent control aims to steer a quantum system from an initial state to a target state via an external field. For given initial and final (target) states the coherent control is termed state-to-state control. A generalisation is steering simultaneously an arbitrary set of initial pure states to an arbitrary set of final states, i.e. controlling a unitary transformation. Such an application sets the foundation for a quantum gate operation.
Controllability of a closed quantum system has been addressed by Tarn and Clark. Their theorem based in control theory states that for a finite dimensional closed quantum system, the system is completely controllable, i.e. an arbitrary unitary transformation of the system can be realized by an appropriate application of the controls, if the control operators and the unperturbed Hamiltonian generate the Lie algebra of all Hermitian operators. Complete controllability implies state-to-state controllability.
The computational task of finding a control field for a particular state to state transformation is difficult and becomes more difficult with the increase in the size of the system. This task is in the class of hard inversion problems of high computational complexity. The algorithmic task of finding the field that generates a unitary transformation scales factorially more difficult with the size of the system. This is because a larger number of state-to-state control fields have to be found without interfering with the other control fields.
Once constraints are imposed controllability can be degraded. For example, what is the minimum time required to achieve a control objective . this is termed quantum speed limit.
