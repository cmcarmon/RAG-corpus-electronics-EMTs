Linear expansion means change in one dimension (length) as opposed to change in volume (volumetric expansion). To a first approximation, the change in length measurements of an object due to thermal expansion is related to temperature change by a "linear expansion coefficient". It is the fractional change in length per degree of temperature change. Assuming negligible effect of pressure, we may write:





α

L


=


1
L






d
L


d
T





{\displaystyle \alpha _{L}={\frac {1}{L}}\,{\frac {dL}{dT}}}

where



L


{\displaystyle L}
is a particular length measurement and



d
L

/

d
T


{\displaystyle dL/dT}
is the rate of change of that linear dimension per unit change in temperature.
The change in the linear dimension can be estimated to be:







Δ
L

L


=

Δ
T


{\displaystyle {\frac {\Delta L}{L}}=\alpha _{L}\Delta T}

This equation works well as long as the linear-expansion coefficient does not change much over the change in temperature



Δ
T


{\displaystyle \Delta T}
, and the fractional change in length is small



Δ
L

/

L
≪
1


{\displaystyle \Delta L/L\ll 1}
. If either of these conditions does not hold, the equation must be integrated.
