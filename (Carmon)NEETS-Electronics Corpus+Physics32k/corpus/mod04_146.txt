The flux used in tinning copper wire is a mixture of denatured alcohol and freshly ground rosin. This 
type of flux may be mixed just prior to use. A premixed paste flux may also be used. The solder used for 
terminal lugs, splices, and connectors is a mixture of 60-percent tin and 40-percent lead. Maintain the 
temperature of the solder bath (pot) between 450 and 500ยบ F.  This keeps the solder in a liquid state. Skim 
the surface of the solder pot, as necessary, with a metal spoon or blade. This keeps the solder clean and 
free from oxides, dirt, and so forth.
