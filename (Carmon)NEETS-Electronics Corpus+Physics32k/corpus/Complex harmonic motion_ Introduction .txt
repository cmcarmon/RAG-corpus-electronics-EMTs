Damped harmonic motion is a real oscillation, in which an object is hanging on a spring. Because of the existence of internal friction and air resistance, the system will over time experience a decrease in amplitude. The decrease of amplitude is due to the fact that the energy goes into thermal energy.
Damped harmonic motion happens because the spring is not very efficient at storing and releasing energy so that the energy dies out. The damping force is proportional to the velocity of the object and is at the opposite direction of the motion so that the object slows down quickly. Specifically, When an object is damping, the damping force will relate to velocity with a coefficient c. The equation is "F=-cv".
The diagram shown on the right indicates three types of damped harmonic motion.
Critically damped: The system returns to equilibrium as quickly as possible without oscillating.
Underdamped: The system oscillates (at reduced frequency compared to the undamped case) with the amplitude gradually decreasing to zero.
Overdamped: The system returns (exponentially decays) to equilibrium without oscillating.
