In the hydrodynamic analogy to electronic circuits, a capacitor is equivalent to a 
bottle,  as  shown  in  Figure  2.4.  The  voltage  across  the  capacitor  is  represented  by  the 
height of fluid in the bottle. As fluid is added to the bottle, the fluid level rises just as 
charges flowing onto the capacitor plate build up the voltage. A small capacitor is a thin 
bottle,  where  adding  a  small  volume  of  fluid  quickly  raise 
level. 
Correspondingly,  a  large  capacitor  is  a  wide  bottle,  where  a  larger  volume  of  fluid  is 
required to raise the fluid level by the same distance.
