It should be noted that resistance measurement using both an ammeter and a voltmeter
is subject to compound error. Because the accuracy of both instruments factors in to the Ô¨Ånal
result, the overall measurement accuracy may be worse than either instrument considered
alone. For instance, if the ammeter is accurate to +/- 1% and the voltmeter is also accurate to
+/- 1%, any measurement dependent on the indications of both instruments may be inaccurate
by as much as +/- 2%.
