▶✓ The body: The second section, on the right of the schematic, contains 
a 4017 CMOS decade counter chip with LEDs connected to each of its 
10 output pins. As I explain in Chapter 11, pins 1–7 and pins 9–11 on the 
4017 chip go from low to high one at a time (but not in the same order as 
the pin numbers) when a trigger signal is connected to pin 14. Resistor 
R3 limits the current passing through whichever LED is activated at any 
given time.
