The relationship between attracting or repelling charged bodies was first discovered and written
about by a French scientist named Charles A. Coulomb. Coulombâ€™s Law states that CHARGED BODIES
ATTRACT OR REPEL EACH OTHER WITH A FORCE THAT IS DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL TO
THE PRODUCT OF THEIR INDIVIDUAL CHARGES, AND IS INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO
THE SQUARE OF THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM.
