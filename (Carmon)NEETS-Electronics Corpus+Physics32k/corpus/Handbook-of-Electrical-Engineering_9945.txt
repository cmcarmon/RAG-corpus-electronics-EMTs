Pole Placement
Probably the simplest modern design procedure is pole placement. Recall that root locus design was presented
as placing the two dominant poles of the closed-loop transfer function at desired locations. The pole-placement
procedure  places  all  poles  of  the  closed-loop  transfer  function,  or  equivalently,  all  roots  of  the  closed-loop
system characteristic equation, at desirable locations.
