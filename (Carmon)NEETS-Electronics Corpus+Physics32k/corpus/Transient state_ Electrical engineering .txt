When a switch is flipped in an appropriate electrical circuit containing a capacitor or inductor, the component draws out the resulting change in voltage or current (respectively), causing the system to take a substantial amount of time to reach a new steady state.
We can define a transient by saying that when a quantity is at rest or in uniform motion and a change in time takes place , changing the existing state , a transient has taken place.
When a SCR (four-layer PNPN Device) is switched on we have the problem of transients occurring as a result of high values of current and voltage oscillating around the point before normal levels are obtained again. Filtering can prevent damage to SCR by means of : LC filters , zener diodes , trans-zorps , varistors.
