Having  explained  some  of  the  theory  behind  the 
design  of  heat  dissipators,  we  shall  move  on  to 
describe  some  practical  heatsink  and  mounting 
arrangements.  Typical 
for 
several common case styles are listed in Table 19.4. 
  A selection of heatsink cross sections is shown in 
Fig.  19.41.  These  range  from  a  simple  folded  U-
section  metal  plate  with  a  thermal  resistance  of
