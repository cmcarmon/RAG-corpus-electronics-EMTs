Heaters, lamps, hair dryers, and electric razors are among the electrical 
devices that use 120 volts AC directly; clothes dryers, which require more 
power, use 240 volts AC directly from a special wall outlet. If your hair dryer 
uses 60 Hz power, and you’re visiting a country that uses 50 Hz power, you’ll 
need a power converter to get the frequency you need from your host country.
