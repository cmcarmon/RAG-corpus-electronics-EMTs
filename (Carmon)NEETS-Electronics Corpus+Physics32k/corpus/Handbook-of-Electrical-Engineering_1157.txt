Inﬁnite impulse response (IIR) ﬁlter: A ﬁlter whose output in response to a unit impulse function remains
nonzero for indeﬁnitely many samples. An IIR ﬁlter is deﬁned by a linear constant-coefﬁcient difference
equation in which the output depends on the present and previous samples of the input and on previously
computed samples of the output.
