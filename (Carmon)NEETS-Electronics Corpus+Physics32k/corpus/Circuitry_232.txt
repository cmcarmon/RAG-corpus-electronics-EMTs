In its pure state, silicon is an insulator because the 
covalent  bonding  rigidly  holds  all  of  the  electrons 
leaving  no  free  (easily  loosened)  electrons  to 
conduct current. If, however, an atom of a different 
element  (i.e.  an  impurity) is  introduced  that  has 
five electrons in its valence shell, a surplus electron 
will  be  present,  as  shown  in  Fig.  5.2.  These  free 
electrons  become  available  for  use  as  charge 
carriers and they can be made to move through the 
lattice by applying an external potential difference 
to the material. 
  Similarly, if the impurity element introduced into 
the  pure  silicon  lattice  has  three  electrons  in  its 
valence  shell,  the  absence  of  the  fourth  electron 
needed for proper covalent bonding will produce a
