Assuming that the potentiometer wiper is being moved such that the rate of current in-
crease through the inductor is steady, the di/dt term of the formula will be a ﬁxed value. This
ﬁxed value, multiplied by the inductor’s inductance in Henrys (also ﬁxed), results in a ﬁxed
voltage of some magnitude. From a physical perspective, the gradual increase in current re-
sults in a magnetic ﬁeld that is likewise increasing. This gradual increase in magnetic ﬂux
causes a voltage to be induced in the coil as expressed by Michael Faraday’s induction equa-
