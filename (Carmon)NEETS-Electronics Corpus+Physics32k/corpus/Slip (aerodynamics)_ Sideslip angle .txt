The sideslip angle, also called angle of sideslip (AOS, AoS,



β


{\displaystyle \beta }
, Greek letter beta), is a term used in fluid dynamics and aerodynamics and aviation. It relates to the rotation of the aircraft centerline from the relative wind. In flight dynamics it is given the shorthand notation



β


{\displaystyle \beta }
(beta) and is usually assigned to be "positive" when the relative wind is coming from the right of the nose of the airplane. The sideslip angle



β


{\displaystyle \beta }
is essentially the directional angle of attack of the airplane. It is the primary parameter in directional stability considerations.
In vehicle dynamics, side slip angle is defined as the angle made by the velocity vector to longitudinal axis of the vehicle at the center of gravity in an instantaneous frame. As the lateral acceleration increases during cornering, the side slip angle decreases. Thus at very high speed turns and small turning radius, there is a high lateral acceleration and

could be a negative value.
