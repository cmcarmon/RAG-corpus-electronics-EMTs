The Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) [Yee, 1966; Kunz and Luebbers, 1993; Taﬂove, 1995] is a numerical
method for the solution of electromagnetic ﬁeld interaction problems. It utilizes a geometry mesh, usually of
rectangular box-shaped cells. The constitutive parameters for each cell edge may be set independently, so that
objects having irregular geometries and inhomogeneous dielectric composition can be analyzed.
