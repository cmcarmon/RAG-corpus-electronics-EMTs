For example, in Fig. 1.7, we have two representations of the same volt-
age. In Fig. 1.7(a), point a is 
V above point b; in Fig. 1.7(b), point b
is 
V above point a. We may say that in Fig. 1.7(a), there is a 9-V
voltage drop from a to b or equivalently a 9-V voltage rise from b to
a.  In  other  words,  a  voltage  drop  from  a to  b is  equivalent  to  a  volt-
age rise from b to a.
