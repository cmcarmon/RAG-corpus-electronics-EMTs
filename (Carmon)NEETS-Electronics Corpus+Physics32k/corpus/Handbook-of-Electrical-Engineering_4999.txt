In both solid and liquid dielectrics, the breakdown strength under dc and impulse ﬁelds is markedly greater
than that obtained under ac ﬁelds, thus suggesting that under ac conditions the breakdown may be partially
thermal in nature. Thermal breakdown occurs at localized hot spots where the rate of heat generated exceeds
that dissipated by the surrounding medium. The temperature at such hot spots continues to rise until it becomes
sufﬁciently  high  to  induce  fusion  and  vaporization,  causing  eventually  the  development  of  a  channel  along
which breakdown ensues between the opposite electrodes. Since a ﬁnite amount of time is required for the heat
buildup to occur to lead to the thermal instability, thermally induced breakdown is contingent upon the time
of  the  alternating  voltage  application  and  is  thus  implicated  as  the  leading  cause  of  breakdown  in  many
dielectrics under long-term operating conditions. However, under some circumstances thermal instability may
develop over a very short time; for example, some materials have been found to undergo thermal breakdown
when subjected to very short repetitive voltage pulses. In low-loss dielectrics, such as polyethylene, the occur-
rence of thermal breakdown is highly improbable under low operating temperatures, while glasses with signif-
icant ionic content are more likely to fail thermally, particularly at higher frequencies.
