The electronic industry wants an electronic techni-
cian to know where to find information rather than to 
memorize it. They want this person to have the ability 
to do the job rather than to spend time trying to memo-
rize a lot of information that is in the reference manu-
als. However, they also want the electronic technician to 
know how and where to find the necessary information.
Many reference books provide this electronics 
knowledge. Manufacturer reference books are set up 
more for designers of electronic circuits. The electron-
ics technician should be familiar with these manufac-
turer	reference	manuals. Manufacturerâ€™s reference 
manuals are updated annually. Before throwing out an 
older reference manual, check that the newer manual 
covers the same material. Many times a product line is 
discontinued, and the older reference manuals are the 
only documentation available.
