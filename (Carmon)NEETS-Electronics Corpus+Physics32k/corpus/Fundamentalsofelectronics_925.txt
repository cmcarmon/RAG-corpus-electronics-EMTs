Note that the data rate allowed by the capacity can exceed the bandwidth when the signal-to-noise ratio

exceeds 0 dB. Our results for BPSK and FSK indicated the bandwidth they require exceeds 1
of signal sets might be used to achieve capacity? Modem signal sets send more than one bit/transmission
using a number, one of the most popular of which is multi-level signaling. Here, we can transmit several
bits during one transmission interval by representing bit by some signal’s amplitude. For example, two bits
can be sent with a signal set comprised of a sinusoid with amplitudes of ±A and ± A

6.32 Comparison of Analog and Digital Communication41
Analog communication systems, amplitude modulation (AM) radio being a typifying example, can inexpen-
sively communicate a bandlimited analog signal from one location to another (point-to-point communication)
or from one point to many (broadcast). Although it is not shown here, the coherent receiver (Figure 6.6)
provides the largest possible signal-to-noise ratio for the demodulated message. An analysis of this receiver
thus indicates that some residual error will always be present in an analog system’s output.
