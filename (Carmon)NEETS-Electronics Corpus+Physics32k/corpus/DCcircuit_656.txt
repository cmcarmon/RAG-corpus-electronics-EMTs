Whatever the type of meter or size of meter movement, there will be a rated value of voltage
or current necessary to give full-scale indication. In electromagnetic movements, this will be
the ”full-scale deﬂection current” necessary to rotate the needle so that it points to the exact
end of the indicating scale. In electrostatic movements, the full-scale rating will be expressed
as the value of voltage resulting in the maximum deﬂection of the needle actuated by the
plates, or the value of voltage in a cathode-ray tube which deﬂects the electron beam to the
edge of the indicating screen. In digital ”movements,” it is the amount of voltage resulting
in a ”full-count” indication on the numerical display: when the digits cannot display a larger
quantity.
