The  main  difference  between  a  latch  and  an  edge-triggered  ﬂip-ﬂop  is  the  question  of  transparency.  The
gated D latch is transparent (the Q output follows the D input when the control input C = l) and it latches,
captures, or stores the value at the D input at the time the control input C goes to 0. The positive edge-triggered
D ﬂip-ﬂop is never transparent from its data input D to its output Q. When the control input C is 0 the output
Q does not follow the D input and remains unchanged; however, the value at the D input is latched, captured,
or stored at the time the control input C makes a 0 to 1 transition. The characteristic that makes edge-triggered
ﬂip-ﬂops desirable for feedback applications is that, due to their nontransparent property, their outputs can
be fed back as inputs to the device without causing oscillation. This is true for all types of edge-triggered ﬂip-
ﬂops.  A  negative  edge-triggered  J-K  ﬂip-ﬂop  circuit  is  shown  in  the  circuit  diagram  in  Fig. 79.21  with  its
corresponding IEEE symbol. Notice that the J-K ﬂip-ﬂop requires eight logic gates compared to only six logic
gates for the D ﬂip-ﬂop in Fig. 79.20. The reduced characteristic table for this negative edge-triggered ﬂip-ﬂop
is shown in Table 79.14.
