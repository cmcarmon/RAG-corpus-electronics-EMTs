Actually, because the initial rise in IC for the transistor is not quite vertical, there is always a small saturation
voltage VCES across the transistor under these conditions, where VCES means the voltage across the transistor in
the common-emitter mode when saturated. In this saturated condition VCES . 0.3 V for small silicon transistors.
Both these conditions are shown in Fig. 24.28.
