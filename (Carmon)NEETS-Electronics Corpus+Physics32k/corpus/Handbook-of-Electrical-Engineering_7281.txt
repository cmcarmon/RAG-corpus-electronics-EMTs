In addition, digital PCS technologies can be divided into two categories: 2nd generation and 3rd generation
wireless systems. 3rd generation wireless systems, which have yet to be deployed, promise an improvement on
2nd  generation  (already  deployed)  systems  in  voice  quality  and  data  services.  In  particular,  high  rate  packet
data is a critical requirement of 3rd generation systems.
