Token Ring
Token  ring  LANs  were  developed  by  IBM  in  the  early  1980s.  Topologically,  stations  are  arranged  in  a  circle
with point-to-point links between neighbors. Transmissions ï¬‚ow in only one direction (clockwise or counter-
clockwise). A  message  transmitted  is  relayed  over  the  point-to-point  links  to  the  receiving  station  and  then
forwarded around the rest of the ring and back to the sender to serve as an acknowledgment.
