reduction 
in  base  current  will  produce  a 
corresponding  reduction  in  collector  current  to 
offset  the  original  change.  Conversely,  if  the 
collector current falls, the collector voltage will rise 
and  the  base  current  will  increase.  This,  in  turn, 
will  produce  a  corresponding  increase  in  collector 
current to offset the original change. 
  The negative feedback path in Fig. 7.32 provides 
feedback  that  involves  an  a.c.  (signal)  component 
as  well  as  the  d.c.  bias.  As  a  result  of  the  a.c. 
feedback, there is a slight reduction in signal gain. 
The signal  gain can be increased by removing the 
a.c.  signal  component  from  the  feedback  path  so 
that  only  the  d.c.  bias  component  is  present.  This 
can be achieved with the aid of a bypass capacitor 
as  shown  in  Fig.  7.33.  The  value  of  bypass 
capacitor,  Cl,  is  chosen  so  that  the  component 
exhibits  a  very  low  reactance  at  the  lowest  signal 
frequency when compared with the series base bias
