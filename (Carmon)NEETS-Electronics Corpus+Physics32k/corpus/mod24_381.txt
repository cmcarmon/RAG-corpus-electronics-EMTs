Fiber splice alignment can involve passive or active fiber core alignment. Passive alignment relies on
precision reference surfaces, either grooves or cylindrical holes, to align fiber cores during splicing.
Active alignment involves the use of light for accurate fiber alignment. Active alignment may consist of
either monitoring the loss through the splice during splice alignment or by using a microscope to
accurately align the fiber cores for splicing. To monitor loss either an optical source and optical power
meter or an optical time domain reflectometer (OTDR) are used. Active alignment procedures produce
low-loss fiber splices.
