The study of data types and data structures is a part of the discipline of computer programming. The terms
refer to the two aspects of data objects: their usage and their implementation, respectively. The study of data
types deals with the identiﬁcation of (abstract) data objects in the context of a programming project and with
methods of their more or less formal speciﬁcation; the study of data structures, on the other hand, is concerned
with the implementation of such objects using already existing data objects as raw material.
