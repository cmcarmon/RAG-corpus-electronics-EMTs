Sound intensity and loudness are often mistakenly interpreted as having the same meaning. Although
they are related, they are not the same. Sound INTENSITY is a measure of the sound energy of a wave.
LOUDNESS, on the other hand, is the sensation the intensity (and sometimes frequency) the sound wave
produces on the ear. Increasing the intensity causes an increase in loudness but not in a direct proportion.
For instance, doubling the loudness of a sound requires about a tenfold increase in the intensity of the
sound.
