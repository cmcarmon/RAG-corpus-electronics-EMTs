Test case execution can be carried out either singly for individual test cases or for entire sets of related test
cases  using test  scripts.  It  is  obvious  that  manually  running  one  test  case  at  a  time  is  too  expensive  for  large
software projects. Tools for multi-test execution support, sometimes called a test harness, are available in either
stand-alone form or as part of several CASE tool suites.
