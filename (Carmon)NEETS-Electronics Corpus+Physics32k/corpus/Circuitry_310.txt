Example 6.4 
 
A 5V  zener  diode  has  a  maximum  rated  power 
dissipation of 500 mW. If the diode is to be used in 
a simple regulator circuit to supply a regulated 5 V 
to a load having a resistance of 400 G, determine a 
suitable  value  of  series  resistor  for  operation  in 
conjunction with a supply of 9 V. 
 
Solution 
 
We shall use an arrangement similar to that shown 
in  Fig.  6.19.  First  we  should  determine  the 
maximum value for the series resistor, RS:
