By the divergence theorem, Gauss's law can alternatively be written in the differential form:




∇
⋅

E

=


ρ

ε

0






{\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf {E} ={\frac {\rho }{\varepsilon _{0}}}}

where ∇ · E is the divergence of the electric field, ε0 is the electric constant, and ρ is the total electric charge density (charge per unit volume).
