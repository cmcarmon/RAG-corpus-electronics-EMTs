Linear elements include a v–i relation, which can be linear if
it satisﬁes the homogeneity property and the superposition
principle. The homogeneity property refers to proportionality;
that is, if i gives a voltage of v, ki gives a voltage of kv for any
arbitrary constant k. The superposition principle implies addi-
tivity; that is, if i1 gives a voltage of v1 and i2 gives a voltage of
v2, then i1 þ i2 should give a voltage v1 þ v2. It is easily veriﬁed
that v ¼ Ri and v ¼ L di=dt are linear relations. Elements that
possess such linear relations are called linear elements, and a
circuit that is made up of linear elements is called a linear
circuit.
