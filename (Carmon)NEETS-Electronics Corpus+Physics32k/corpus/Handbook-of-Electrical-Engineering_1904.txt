Recent  creation  and  ﬁnalization  of  the  Motion-Picture  Expert  Group  (MPEG-4)  international  standard  has
provided a common platform and uniﬁed framework for multimedia information representation. In addition
to  providing  highly  efﬁcient  compression  of  both  natural  and  synthetic  audio-visual  (AV)  contents  such  as
video,  audio,  sound,  texture  maps,  graphics,  still  images,  MIDI,  and  animated  structure,  MPEG-4  enables
greater capabilities for manipulating AV contents in the compressed domain with object-based representation.
MPEG-4 is a natural migration of the technological convergence of several ﬁelds: digital television, computer
graphics,  interactive  multimedia,  and  Internet.  This  tutorial  chapter  brieﬂy  discusses  some  example  features
and applications enabled by the MPEG-4 standard.
