one  another.  These  two  components,  the  E-field 
and  the  H-field, are  inseparable.  The  resulting 
wave travels away from the source with the E and 
H lines mutually at right angles to the direction of 
propagation, as shown in Fig. 13.2. 
  Radio  waves  are  said  to  be  polarized  in  the 
plane of the electric (E) field. Thus, if the E-field is 
vertical, the signal is said to be vertically polarized 
whereas,  if  the  E-field  is  horizontal,  the  signal  is 
said to be horizontally polarized. 
  Figure  13.3  shows  the  electric  E-field  lines  in 
the space between a transmitter and a receiver. The 
transmitter  aerial  (a  simple  dipoleâ€”see  page  237) 
is  supplied  with  a  high  frequency  alternating 
current.  This  gives  rise  to  an  alternating  electric 
field  between  the  ends  of  the  aerial  and  an 
alternating  magnetic  field  around  (and  at  right 
angles to) it.
