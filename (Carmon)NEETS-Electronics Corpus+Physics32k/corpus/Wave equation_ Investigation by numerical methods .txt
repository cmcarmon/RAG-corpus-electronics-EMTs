Approximating the continuous string with a finite number of equidistant mass points one gets the following physical model:

If each mass point has the mass m, the tension of the string is f, the separation between the mass points is Δx and ui, i = 1, ..., n are the offset of these n points from their equilibrium points (i.e. their position on a straight line between the two attachment points of the string) the vertical component of the force towards point i+1 is
and the vertical component of the force towards point i−1 is
Taking the sum of these two forces and dividing with the mass m one gets for the vertical motion:
As the mass density is




ρ
=


m

Δ
x





{\displaystyle \rho ={\frac {m}{\Delta x}}}

this can be written
The wave equation is obtained by letting Δx → 0 in which case ui(t) takes the form u(x, t) where u(x, t) is continuous function of two variables,







u

i




{\displaystyle {\ddot {u}}_{i}}
takes the form

But the discrete formulation (3) of the equation of state with a finite number of mass point is just the suitable one for a numerical propagation of the string motion. The boundary condition

)

u
(
L

=
0


{\displaystyle u(0,t)=u(L,t)=0}

where L is the length of the string takes in the discrete formulation the form that for the outermost points u1 and un the equation of motion are
and
while for 1 < i < n
where



c

{\displaystyle c={\sqrt {\frac {f}{\rho }}}}

If the string is approximated with 100 discrete mass points one gets the 100 coupled second order differential equations (5), (6) and (7) or equivalently 200 coupled first order differential equations.

using an 8th order multistep method the 6 states displayed in figure 2 are found:

The red curve is the initial state at time zero at which the string is "let free" in a predefined shape with all

without being actively constraint by the boundary conditions at the two extremes of the string. The shape of the wave is constant, i.e. the curve is indeed of the form f(x−ct).
