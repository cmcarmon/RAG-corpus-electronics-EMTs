In computational anatomy,



A
v


{\displaystyle Av}
was first called the Eulerian or diffeomorphic shape momentum since when integrated against Eulerian velocity



v


{\displaystyle v}
gives energy density, and since there is a conservation of diffeomorphic shape momentum which holds. The operator



A


{\displaystyle A}
is the generalized moment of inertia or inertial operator.
