The discrete-time Lyapunov stability theory indicates that
the control problem can be solved as long as the numerical
value of the failure dynamics is realized at each time-step,
which is a measure of how far the failure drives the system
dynamics away from the desired dynamics. Based on the above
theoretical analysis, the system under unexpected catastrophic
failures can be stabilized online, and the performance can be
recovered provided an effective online estimator for the un-
known failure dynamics such that the necessary and sufﬁcient
condition in theorem 1 is satisﬁed. Moreover, since the online
estimator is used to provide the approximated numerical value
of the failure dynamics at each time-step based on the most
recent measurements (i.e., the failure may be time varying), no
speciﬁc structure or dynamics is required for the estimator. In
other words, only a static function approximator that approxi-
mates the most recent behavior of the failure is needed for the
control purpose. Figure 8.4 indicates how the S function is
bounded by the upper bounds of the nominal model uncer-
tainty, DN ~yy(k þ 1), optimization error, DE(k), and the predic-
tion error of the failure dynamics, Dnf ~yy(k þ 1).
