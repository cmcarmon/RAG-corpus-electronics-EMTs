Before 1 March 1922, the Canary Islands still used mean solar time until it was discovered that the royal decree of 1900 applied only to the Peninsula and Balearic Islands. The Canary Islands then used a time 1 hour behind the rest of Spain; GMT−01:00, until 16 March 1940, and since then, they have used Western European Time (GMT±00:00). Canary Islands observes daylight saving time at the same time (01:00 GMT) the rest of Spain does, that is, changing from 01:00 WET to 02:00 Western European Summer Time on the last Sunday in March (while the rest of Spain changes from 02:00 Central European Time to 03:00 Central European Summer Time) and, when daylight saving time ends, changing from 02:00 Western European Summer Time to 01:00 Western European Time on the last Sunday in October (while the rest of Spain changes from 03:00 Central European Summer Time to 02:00 CET).
It is very popular in Spanish national media, mainly on the radio, to list the notice ′una hora menos en Canarias′ (English: ′one hour less in the Canary Islands′) when the local time is mentioned.
The natural time zone for the Canary Islands is GMT−01:00.
