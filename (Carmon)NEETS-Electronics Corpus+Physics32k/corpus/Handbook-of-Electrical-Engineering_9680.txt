Zero-knowledge proofs: Two-party protocols by which one party can convince the other party of the validity
to  an  assertion  without  yielding  anything  else.  That  is,  when  executing  such  a  protocol,  the  veriÔ¨Åer  is
essentially  in  the  same  situation  as  he  would  have  been  if  he  was  granted  by  a  trusted  party  that  the
assertion is valid.
