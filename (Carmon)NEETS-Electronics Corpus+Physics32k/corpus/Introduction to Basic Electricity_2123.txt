The final calculation to determine the value of re-
sistor R1 is somewhat different. In this case, the total 
current flowing through the circuits is 1.16 A. In this 
example, the junction A desired voltage is 9 volts. The 
source voltage is 14.8 volts; therefore, resistor R1 must 
drop 14.8 V to 9 V, or drop 5.8 volts.
