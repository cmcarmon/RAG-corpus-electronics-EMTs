As in Chapter 13, the primed notation denotes referral to the stator, and R2 is the per-phase
(cid:7)
a/S accounts for the mechanical power developed and
resistance of the rotor. The resistance R
(cid:7)
b represents the effect of the rotor
the fundamental rotor copper loss, whereas the resistance R
harmonic copper loss.
