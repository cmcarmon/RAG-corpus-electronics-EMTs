Figures 14.19 and 14.20 show the frequency response for different values of Q, keep-
ing the resonance frequency and the peak magnitude constant. To keep the peak
(cid:9)
magnitude the same, we keep R constant at 10 . Similarly, to keep the resonance
1/LC a constant at 105 rad/s. We obtain different values
frequency the same we keep
of Q by choosing different C/L ratios (Equation 14.56), while keeping both R and LC
constant. Thus, for example,
