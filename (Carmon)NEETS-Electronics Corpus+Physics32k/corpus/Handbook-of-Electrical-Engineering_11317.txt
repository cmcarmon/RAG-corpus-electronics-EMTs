Memory is required to store the program and individual patient parameters for the operation of the ICD.
Startup code and some of the main program is often stored in ROM, while the remaining program, parameters,
patient diagnostics (e.g., electrograms), and event markers are stored in RAM. Clinicians and investigators are
increasingly interested in diagnostics obtained from the ICD, which warrants future memory increases.
