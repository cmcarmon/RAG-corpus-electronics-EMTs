In special relativity, the momentum of a particle is given by

{\displaystyle \mathbf {p} ={\frac {m\mathbf {v} }{\sqrt {1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}}\,,}

where m is the particle's rest mass, v its velocity, and c is the speed of light.
If v is very small compared to c, v2/c2 is approximately zero, and so

{\displaystyle \mathbf {p} \approx m\mathbf {v} \,.}

Thus the Newtonian equation p = mv is an approximation of the relativistic equation for bodies moving with low speeds compared to the speed of light.
For example, the relativistic cyclotron frequency of a cyclotron, gyrotron, or high voltage magnetron is given by

{\displaystyle f=f_{\mathrm {c} }{\frac {m_{0}}{m_{0}+T/c^{2}}}\,,}

where fc is the classical frequency of an electron (or other charged particle) with kinetic energy T and (rest) mass m0 circling in a magnetic field. The (rest) mass of an electron is 511 keV. So the frequency correction is 1% for a magnetic vacuum tube with a 5.11 kV direct current accelerating voltage.
