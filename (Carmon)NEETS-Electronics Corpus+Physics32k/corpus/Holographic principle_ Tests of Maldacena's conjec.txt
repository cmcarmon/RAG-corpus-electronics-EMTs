This article is closely related to a number of widely different topics, e.g. on black holes, and generally on Information entropy of Entangled systems, Quantum gravity, Quantum field and superfield theory, String theory and other topics.
In 1997, Juan Martín Maldacena published a seminal and highly cited paper on a conjectured relation between these different fields. In 2013/4, Hyakutake et al. followed with two papers that bring computational evidence that Maldacena’s conjecture may be true. One paper computes the internal energy of a black hole, the position of its event horizon, its entropy and other properties based on the predictions of string theory and the effects of virtual particles. The other paper calculates the internal energy of the corresponding lower-dimensional cosmos with no gravity.
The two last-mentioned simulations match. However, the papers are not an actual proof of Maldacena's conjecture for all cases but a demonstration that the conjecture works for a particular theoretical case, verifying the AdS/CFT correspondence for a particular situation.
