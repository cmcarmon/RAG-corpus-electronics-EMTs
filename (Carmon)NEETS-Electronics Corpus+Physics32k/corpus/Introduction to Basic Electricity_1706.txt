eXaMPLe:	 Find the total resistance for the  circuit 
shown in Figure 13‑29.
The equivalent resistance of the series in the parallel 
portion of the circuit must be determined first. This is 
labeled RS.
Given  
RS  5 ?  
R2  5 180 V  
R3  5 200 V  
R4  5 620 V
Redraw the circuit, substituting equivalent  resistance RS 
for the series resistors R2, R3, and R4. See Figure 13‑30. 
Determine the equivalent parallel resistance RA for RS 
and R5.
Given
 RA 5 ?
 RS 5 1000 V
 R5 5 1000 V
