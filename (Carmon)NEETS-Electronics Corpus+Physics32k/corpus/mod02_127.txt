 INDUCTANCEâ€”The characteristic of an electrical circuit that opposes a change in current. The 
reaction (opposition) is caused by the creation or destruction of a magnetic field. When current starts to 
flow, magnetic lines of force are created. These lines of force cut the conductor inducing a counter emf in 
a direction that opposes current.
