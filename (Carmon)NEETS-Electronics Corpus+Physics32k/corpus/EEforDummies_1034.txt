Breadboard manufacturers make contact strips from a springy metal coated 
with a plating. The plating prevents the contacts from oxidizing, and the 
springiness of the metal allows you to use wire component leads of different 
diameters without seriously deforming the contacts. Note, however, that you 
can damage the contacts if you attempt to use wire larger than 20 gauge or 
use components with very thick leads. If the wire is too thick to go into the 
hole, donâ€™t try to force it. If you do force it, you can loosen the fit of the con-
tact, and your breadboard may not work the way you want it to.
