To establish substructuring coupling / decoupling in each of the above-mentioned domains, two conditions should be met:
Coordinate compatibility, i.e. the connecting nodes of two substructures should have equal interface displacement.
Force equilibrium, i.e. the interface forces between connecting nodes have equal magnitude and opposing sign.
These are the two essential conditions that keep substructures together, hence allow to construct an assembly of multiple components. Note that the conditions are comparable with Kirchhoff's laws for electric circuits, in which case similar conditions apply to currents and voltages though/over electric components in a network; see also Mechanical-electrical analogies.
