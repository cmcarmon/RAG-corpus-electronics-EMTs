In contrast to a two-winding transformer, the autotransformer is a single-winding transformer
having a tap brought out at an intermediate point. Thus, as shown in Figure 11.6.1, a–c is the
single N1-turn winding wound on a laminated core, and b is the intermediate point where the tap
is brought out such that b–c has N2 turns. The autotransformer may generally be used as either
a step-up or a step-down operation. Considering the step-down arrangement, as shown in Figure
11.6.1, let the primary applied voltage be V1, resulting in a magnetizing current and a core ﬂux φm.
Voltage drops in the windings, exciting current, and small phase-angular differences are usually
neglected for the analysis. Then it follows that
