The two major tidal forces acting on Mars are the solar tide and Phobos tide. Love number k2 is an important proportional dimensionless constant relating the tidal field acting to the body with the multipolar moment resulting from the mass distribution of the body. Usually k2 can tell quadrupolar deformation. Finding k2 is helpful in understanding the interior structure on Mars. The most updated k2 obtained by Genova's team is 0.1697 + 0.0009. As if k2 is smaller than 0.10 a solid core would be indicated, this tells that at least the outer core is liquid on Mars, and the predicted core radius is 1520â€“1840 km.
However, current radio tracking data from MGS, ODY and MRO does not allow the effect of phase lag on the tides to be detected because it is too weak and needs more precise measurement on the perturbation of spacecraft in the future.
