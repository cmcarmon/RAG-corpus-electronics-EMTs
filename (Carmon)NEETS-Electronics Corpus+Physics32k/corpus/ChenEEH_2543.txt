A matched hybrid tee (also called a magic tee or T consists of
a combined E- and H-plane waveguide T-junction, as shown in
Figure 7.20. A magic tee is a 3-dB hybrid with directional
coupling properties quite similar to the above-discussed 180
hybrid rate-race ring. The most critical issue in the design of a
magic tee is a broadband matching post or rod located in the
center of the waveguide junction. The magic tee is a popular
component for low-loss and/or high-power circuit applica-
tions.
