The ﬁlter inductor helps to reduce the ripple in current Id and eliminate discontinuous
conduction. Figure 16.1.22 shows input phase voltage waveforms of the diode bridge and a
six-step rotor phase-current waveform, assuming ripple-free Id. For a period T of the switch
d R(T − ton), while the average power
operation, the energy absorbed by resistance R is given by I 2
consumed by R is
