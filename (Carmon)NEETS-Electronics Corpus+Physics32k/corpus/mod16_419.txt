Resistance tests are also used to check a component for grounds. In these tests, the component to be
tested should be disconnected from the rest of the circuit so that no normal circuit ground will exist.
Dismounting the component to be checked is not necessary. The ohmmeter is set for a high-resistance
range. Then the ohmmeter is connected between ground and each electrically separate circuit of the
component being tested. Any resistance reading less than infinity indicates at least a partial ground. You
can also check capacitors suspected of being short-circuited by measuring the resistance. To check a
capacitor suspected of being open, temporarily shunt a known good capacitor then recheck the
performance of the circuit.
