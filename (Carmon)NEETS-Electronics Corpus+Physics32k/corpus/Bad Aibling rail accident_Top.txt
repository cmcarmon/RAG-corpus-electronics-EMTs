On 9 February 2016, two Meridian-branded passenger trains were involved in a head-on collision at Bad Aibling in southeastern Germany. Of approximately 150 people on board the two trains, 12 people died and 85 others were injured, including 24 seriously.
Two months after the accident, investigators announced that it had been caused by a dispatcher who gave incorrect orders to the two trains while distracted by a game he was playing on his mobile phone. The dispatcher further compounded his error when, realizing it, he tried to send emergency codes to the trains but entered the wrong combination into his computer.
