The initial circuit is shown in figure 3-25, view A. The initial voltage and current waves (view B) are
the same as those given for an infinite line. In a short-circuited line the voltage change arrives at the last
inductor in the same manner as the waves on an open-ended line. In this case, however, there is no
capacitor to charge. The current through the final inductor produces a voltage with the polarity shown in
view C. When the field collapses, the inductor acts as a battery and forces current through the capacitor in
the opposite direction, causing it to discharge (view D). Since the amount of energy stored in the
magnetic field is the same as that in the capacitor, the capacitor discharges to zero.
