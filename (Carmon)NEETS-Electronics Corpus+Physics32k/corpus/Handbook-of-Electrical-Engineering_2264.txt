FIGURE  22.8 Experimentally  determined  density  of  states  for  a-Si.  A  and  B  are  acceptor-like  and  donor-like  states,
respectively.  The  arrow  marks  the  position  of  the  Fermi  level efo  in  undoped  hydrogenated  a-Si.  The  energy  spectrum  is
divided into extended states E, band-tail states T, and gap states G. (Source: M.H. Brodsky, Ed., Amorphous Semiconductors,
