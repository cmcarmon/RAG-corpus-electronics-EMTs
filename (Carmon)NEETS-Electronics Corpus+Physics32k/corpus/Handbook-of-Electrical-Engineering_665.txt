Performance of FM-DCSK Modulation Scheme
Figure 5.41 shows why conventional narrow-band systems can fail to operate over a multipath channel. Due
to high attenuation appearing about the multipath-related nulls, the SNR becomes extremely low at the input
of the receiver. Consequently, the demodulator and the carrier recovery circuit, if used, cannot operate.
