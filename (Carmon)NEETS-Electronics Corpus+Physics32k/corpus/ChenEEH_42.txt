Using a Norton equivalent circuit, a voltage source with a
series resistor can be converted into an equivalent current
source with a parallel resistor. In a similar manner, using
Thevenin theorem, a current source with a parallel resistor
can be represented by a voltage source with a series resistor.
These transformations are called source transformations.
The two sources in Figure 1.17 are equivalent between nodes
B and C.
