The total number of counts or stable states a counter can indicate is called MODULUS. For instance,
the modulus of a four-stage counter would be 1610, since it is capable of indicating 00002 to 11112. The
term modulo is used to describe the count capability of counters; that is, modulo-16 for a four-stage
binary counter, modulo-11 for a decade counter, modulo-8 for a three-stage binary counter, and so forth.
