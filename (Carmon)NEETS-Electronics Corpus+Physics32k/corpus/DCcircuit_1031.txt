Let’s suppose that we decide to designate R2 as the “load” resistor in this circuit. We already
have four methods of analysis at our disposal (Branch Current, Mesh Current, Millman’s Theo-
rem, and Superposition Theorem) to use in determining voltage across R2 and current through
R2, but each of these methods are time-consuming. Imagine repeating any of these meth-
ods over and over again to ﬁnd what would happen if the load resistance changed (changing
