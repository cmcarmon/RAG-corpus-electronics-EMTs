VAM is calculated the following way:
VAM = (metres ascended x 60) / Minutes it took to ascend
A standard unit term with the same meaning is Vm/h, vertical metres per hour; the two are used interchangeably.
The relationship between VAM and relative power output is expressed as follows:
Relative power (Watts/kg) = VAM (metres/hour) / (Gradient factor x 100)
This gradient factor ranges between 2.6 for a gradient of 6% and 3.1 for a gradient of 11%. To work out the gradient factor take 2 + (% grade/10)
