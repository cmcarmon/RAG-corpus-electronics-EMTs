TMR has by far the lowest time overhead, but its 200% area
overhead is extremely high. Comparing REMOD to PTMR for
array multipliers shows that the time overheads are much
the same, reaching less than 10%. REMODâ€™s area overhead,
however, is better than 30% less than that of PTMR. The
area overhead fraction for a REMOD Wallace tree is even
lower, with a transistor overhead of 48% and a layout area
overhead of only 36%. The time overhead fraction is higher
because the Wallace tree is a faster circuit than a carry-save
array. Finally, we note that the hardware overhead for both
types of 2-FT REMOD multiplier is also lower than that
of a 1-FT PTMR multiplier; for 3-FT REMOD multipliers,
the overhead is comparable to that of a 1-FT PTMR and
