Two reels are used, tape moves from a supply reel to a take-up reel (both are mounted on hubs). 
Figure 2-18 shows the basic tape drive mechanism. The magnetic oxide coated side of the tape passes 
directly over the read/write head assembly, making contact with the heads. The magnetic tape unit reads 
and writes data in parallel channels or tracks along the length of the tape as shown in figure 2-19, view A. 
Each channel or track is used by a read/write head (one for each channel), as the tape moves across the 
magnetic gap of the head. Read/write heads may be either one gap or two gap as shown in figure 2-19, 
views B and C. The one-gap head has only one magnetic gap at which both reading and writing occur. 
The two-gap head has one gap for reading and another for writing. Although the one gap is satisfactory, 
the two-gap head gives increased speed by checking while writing. For example, a tape being written on 
passes over the write gap where the data is recorded, and then the data is read as it passes over the read 
gap to make a comparison. With this method, errors are detected almost instantly. When you look closely 
at figure 2-19, view B (top view), you will notice that there is one read/write coil in the write head for 
each channel (or track). In this particular case, there are seven. It is the electrical current flowing through 
these coils that magnetizes the iron-oxide coating on the surface of the tape.
