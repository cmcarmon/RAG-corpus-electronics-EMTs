and the adjacent pixel to its left. It indeed reduced the redun-
dancy existing in the image. However, only the redundancy
between two adjacent pixels was exploited. By looking at
images like the ones in Figures 4.16(A) through 4.16(B), we
notice that a pixel has a high correlation with many pixels
surrounding it. This implies that not only the redundancy
between adjacent pixels but also the redundancy in an area of
the image can be exploited. By exploiting this, one expects to
obtain even higher compression ratios. Transform coding is
the generic name given to compression methods in which this
type of redundancy reduction is carried out by means of a
linear transform (Clarke, 1985).
