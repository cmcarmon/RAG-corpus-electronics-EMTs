When you shop for circuit components, you usually donâ€™t go out and pur-
chase only the parts listed for a particular circuit diagram, or schematic. You 
purchase an assortment of parts so you can build several different projects 
without having to run out for parts each time you try something new. Think 
of this like gathering ingredients for cooking and baking. You keep many 
basic ingredients, such as flour, sugar, oil, rice, and spices, on hand all the 
time, and you purchase enough other ingredients to enable you to cook the 
sorts of things you like for a week or two. Well, the same is true when stock-
ing up on electronics parts and components.
