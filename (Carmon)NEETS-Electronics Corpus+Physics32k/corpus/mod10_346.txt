Scientists believe that ionospheric storms result from particle radiation from the sun. Particles 
radiated from a solar eruption have a slower velocity than ultraviolet light waves produced by the 
eruption. This would account for the 18-hour or so time difference between a sid and an ionospheric 
storm. An ionospheric storm that is associated with sunspot activity may begin anytime from 2 days 
before an active sunspot crosses the central meridian of the sun until four days after it passes the central 
meridian. At times, however, active sunspots have crossed the central region of the sun without any 
ionospheric storms occurring. Conversely, ionospheric storms have occurred when there were no visible 
spots on the sun and no preceding sid. As you can see, some correlation between ionospheric storms, sid, 
and sunspot activity is possible, but there are no hard and fast rules. Ionospheric storms can occur 
suddenly without warning.
