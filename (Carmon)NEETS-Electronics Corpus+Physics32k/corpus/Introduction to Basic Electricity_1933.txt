ensure that there are no components in the circuit that 
may be damaged by the current flow from the ohm-
meter. Then place the leads of the ohmmeter across 
the points in the circuit to be measured. If a reading 
 occurs, the path is closed or shorted. If no reading 
 occurs, the path is open. This test is useful to deter-
mine why a circuit does not work.
