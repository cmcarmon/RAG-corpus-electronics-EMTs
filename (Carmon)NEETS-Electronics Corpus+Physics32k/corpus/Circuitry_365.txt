A complete  h-parameter  equivalent  circuit  for  a 
transistor  operating  in  common-emitter  mode  is 
shown  in  Fig.  7.29.  We  have  already  shown  how 
the two most important parameters, hie and hfe, can 
be found from the transistorâ€™s characteristic curves. 
  The  remaining  parameters,  hre and  hoe, can,  in 
many  applications,  be  ignored.  A  typical  set  of h-
parameters  for  a  BFY50  transistor  is  shown  in 
Table 7.6. Note how small hre and hoe are for a real 
transistor!
