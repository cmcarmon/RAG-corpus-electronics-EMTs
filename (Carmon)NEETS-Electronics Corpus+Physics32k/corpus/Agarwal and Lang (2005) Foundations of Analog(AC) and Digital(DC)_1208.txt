This problem studies the small-signal analysis of the ZFET ampli-
fier from Problem 7.6 (Figure 7.77). Assume that the amplifier is biased at an input
voltage VIN such that the ZFET exhibits saturated operation; the corresponding bias
output voltage is VOUT. For this case, derive the small-signal voltage gain vout/vin of the
amplifier.

The circuit shown in Figure 8.4 delivers a nearly constant current
to its load despite the fact that the power supply is noisy. The noise is modeled by
the small signal vs superimposed on the constant-supply voltage VS. Thus, VS and
vs are the large-signal and small-signal components of the total power supply voltage
vS, respectively. IL and il are the large-signal and small-signal components of the load
