The time required to charge a capacitor to 63 percent (actually 63.2 percent) of full charge or to
discharge it to 37 percent (actually 36.8 percent) of its initial voltage is known as the TIME CONSTANT
(TC) of the circuit. The charge and discharge curves of a capacitor are shown in figure 3-11. Note that the
charge curve is like the curve in figure 3-9, graph (D), and the discharge curve like the curve in figure 3-9,
graph (B).
