Before the advent of semiconductors known as ”ﬁeld-effect transistors,” vacuum tubes were
used as amplifying devices to perform this boosting. Such vacuum-tube voltmeters, or (VTVM’s)
were once very popular instruments for electronic test and measurement. Here is a photograph
of a very old VTVM, with the vacuum tube exposed!
