While Koopmans' theorem was originally stated for calculating ionization energies from restricted (closed-shell) Hartreeâ€“Fock wavefunctions, the term has since taken on a more generalized meaning as a way of using orbital energies to calculate energy changes due to changes in the number of electrons in a system.
