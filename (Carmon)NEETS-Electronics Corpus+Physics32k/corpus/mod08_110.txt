NOTE: Only approximate impedance values are shown. This is because the exact impedance values 
will vary from circuit to circuit. The impedance of any particular circuit depends upon the device 
(transistor) and the other circuit components. The value of impedance can be computed by dividing the 
signal voltage by the signal current. Therefore:
