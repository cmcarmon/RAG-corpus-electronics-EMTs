Particularly  in  missile  telemetry,  it  is  important  that  multiple  measurements  be  transmitted  over  a  single
carrier  to  save  power  and  minimize  electronic  equipment  and  antennas.  Such  simultaneous  transmission  of
signals over a common path, called multiplexing, is sometimes used in industrial telemetry. When concurrent
data about several simultaneous events are transmitted by several subcarriers, each subcarrier oscillator has a
distinctive reference frequency and swings from this center frequency toward arbitrary maximum and minimum
frequencies in response to signals from a corresponding transducer. Thus a number of separate audio frequency
bands are sent over the radio frequency carrier. This is called frequency division multiplexing. The frequency
division  multiplex  requires  careful  adjustment  of  subcarrier  frequencies  and  the  corresponding  Ô¨Ålters  at  the
receiver and strong suppression of harmonics to avoid cross talk or interaction between channels.
