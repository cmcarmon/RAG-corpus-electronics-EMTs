To ensure that the mercury has vaporized sufficiently, the filament voltage must be applied to
mercury-vapor tubes for at least 30 seconds before the plate voltage is applied. If vaporization is
incomplete, only partial ionization is possible. Under these conditions, the application of plate voltage
results in a relatively high voltage drop across the tube (remember E = I Ã— R), and the positive ions
present are accelerated to a high velocity in the direction of the cathode. As the ions strike the cathode,
they tear away particles of the emitting surface, usually causing permanent damage to the cathode and the
tube. When the mercury is completely vaporized, the action of the gas is such that the voltage drop across
the tube can never rise above the ionization potential (about 15 volts). At this low potential, positive-ion
bombardment of the cathode does not result in damage to the emitting surface.
