A Sverdrup wave (also known as Poincaré wave, or rotational gravity wave ) is a wave in the ocean, which is affected by gravity and Earth's rotation (see Coriolis effect).
For a non-rotating fluid, shallow water waves are affected only by gravity (see Gravity wave), where the phase velocity of shallow water gravity wave (c) can be noted as




c
=
(
g
H

)

1

/

{\displaystyle c=(gH)^{1/2}}

and the group velocity (cg) of shallow water gravity wave can be noted as





c


g



=

{\displaystyle c_{\mathrm {g} }=(gH)^{1/2}}
i.e.



c

{\displaystyle c=c_{\mathrm {g} }}

where g is gravity, λ is the wavelength and H is the total depth.
