equation as sums, and not products. Equations will always be of this form if the
circuit is made up of linear elements. In fact, we use this property to define a
linear network: A network is linear if the response to an input ax1 + bx2 is the
same as a times the response to x1 alone plus b times the response to x2 alone.
That is, if f (x) is the response to some excitation x, then the system is linear if
and only if
