Cavity-Based Devices
Cavity-based optical logic devices are composed of two highly reﬂective
mirrors  that  are  separated  by  a  distance  d  [Fig. 79.24(a)].  The  volume
between the mirrors, referred to as the cavity of the etalon, is ﬁlled with
a  nonlinear  material  possessing  an  index  of  refraction  that  varies  with
intensity  according  to  nc  =  n0  +  n2  gc  where  n0  is  the  linear  index  of
refraction, n2 is the nonlinear index of refraction, and gc is the intensity
of light within the cavity. In the ideal case, the characteristic response of
the reﬂectivity of a Fabry-Perot cavity, Rfp, is shown in Fig. 79.24(b). At
low intensities, the cavity resonance peak is not coincident with the wave-
length of the incident light; thus the reﬂectivity is high, which allows little
of the incident light to be transmitted [solid curves in Fig. 79.24(b)]. As
the intensity of the incident light g increases, so does the intercavity light
intensity which shifts the resonance peak [dotted curve in Fig. 79.24(b)].
This shift in the resonant peak increases the transmission which in turn
reduces the reﬂectivity. This reduction in y will continue with increasing
g until a minimum value is reached. It should be noted that in practice
all systems of interest have both intensity-dependent absorption and n2.
To  implement  a  two-input  NOR  gate  using  the  characteristic  curve
shown in Fig. 79.24(c) requires a third input which is referred to as the
bias beam, gb.This energy source biases the etalon at a point on its oper-
ating curve such that any other input will exceed the nonlinear portion
of  the  curve  moving  the  etalon  from  the  high  reﬂection  state.  This  is
illustrated in Fig. 79.24(c) where the gb combines with the inputs g1 and
g2 to exceed the threshold of the nonlinear characteristic curve.
