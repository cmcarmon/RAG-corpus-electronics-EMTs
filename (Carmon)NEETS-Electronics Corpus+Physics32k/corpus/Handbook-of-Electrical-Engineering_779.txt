From Eq. (10.8) we see that the 3-dB bandwidth of the Butterworth ﬁlter is equal to wn. For the case wn = 2
rad/s, the frequency response curves of the Butterworth ﬁlter are plotted in Fig. 10.6. Also displayed are the
frequency response curves for the one-pole low-pass ﬁlter with transfer function H(s) = 2/(s + 2), and the two-
pole low-pass ﬁlter with z = 1 and with 3-dB bandwidth equal to 2 rad/s. Note that the Butterworth ﬁlter has
the sharpest cutoff of all three ﬁlters.
