The main cause of intrinsic absorption in the infrared region is the characteristic vibration frequency
of atomic bonds. In silica glass, absorption is caused by the vibration of silicon-oxygen (Si-O) bonds. The
interaction between the vibrating bond and the electromagnetic field of the optical signal causes intrinsic
absorption. Light energy is transferred from the electromagnetic field to the bond. The tail of the infrared
absorption band is shown in figure 2-21.
