In the following description, call the 3 containers:
(A) Basin (top)
(B) Water Supply (middle)
(C) Air Supply (bottom)
Heron's fountain is built as follows:
Start with a basin (A), open to the air. Run a pipe from a hole in the bottom of that basin (A) to an airtight air supply container (C).
Run another pipe from the top of the air supply container (C) up to nearly the top of the airtight water supply container (B).
A pipe should run from almost the bottom of the water supply container (B), up through the bottom of the basin (A) to a height just above the basin's rim. The fountain will issue upwards through this pipe.
Operation:
Initially, the air supply container (C) should contain only air; the water supply container (B) should contain only water.
To start the fountain, pour water into the basin (A).
The water from the basin (A) flows by gravity into the air supply container (C). This water forces the air in (C) to move into the water supply container (B), where the increased air pressure in (B) forces the water in (B) to issue out the top as a fountain into the basin (A). The fountain water caught in the basin (A) will drain back to the air supply container (C).
The flow will stop when the water supply container (B) is empty.
