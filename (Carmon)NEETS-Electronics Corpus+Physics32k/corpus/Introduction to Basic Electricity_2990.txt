If voltage is applied to P-type material, it causes the 
holes to move toward the negative terminal and the elec-
trons to move toward the positive terminal  (FigureÂ 28-9). 
In addition to the holes provided by the  acceptor atom, 
holes are produced as electrons break away from their 
 covalent bonds, creating electron-hole pairs.
