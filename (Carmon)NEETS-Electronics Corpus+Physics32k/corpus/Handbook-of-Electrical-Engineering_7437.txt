A communication link is usually a single source, a single user, and the components and channel between
source and user. A typical link architecture is shown in Fig. 78.1. The important performance parameter in a
digital communication link is typically the reliability of the communication link as measured by the symbol
or bit error rate (BER). In an analog communication link the performance parameter of interest is typically
the  signal-to-noise  ratio  (SNR)  at  the  receiver  input  or  the  mean-square  error  of  the  receiver  output.  The
simulation is usually performed to determine the effect of system parameters, such as Ô¨Ålter bandwidths or code
rate,  or  to  determine  the  effect  of  environmental  parameters,  such  as  noise  levels,  noise  statistics,  or  power
spectral densities.
