Originally intended to carry the same XLR-99 engine used by the X-15, the primary engine was changed to the LR-105, which was the sustainer engine used on the Atlas launcher. This rocket engine, burning RP-1 and LOX, was intended to accelerate the X-24C to hypersonic speeds in order to ignite the hydrogen fueled, air breathing ram/scramjet mounted in the belly of the airframe with which it would attain cruise speeds of at least Mach 6 and peak velocities of Mach 8+ at altitudes of 90,000 feet or more.
As such, this vehicle was plainly not intended to reach orbit, but may have served as a technology testbed for development of later black orbiter programs, perhaps even the purported Blackstar project. It may also have served as an intermediate stage for an expendable upper stage capable of putting a small payload in orbit.
