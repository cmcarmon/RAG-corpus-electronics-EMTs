The signal take-off angle (transmitting antenna's angle of radiation) determines the height of the 
scatter volume and the size of the scatter angle. A low signal take-off angle produces a low scatter 
volume, which in turn permits a receiving antenna that is aimed at a low angle to the scatter volume to 
capture the scattered energy.
