The flight path angle is the angle between the orbiting body's velocity vector (= the vector tangent to the instantaneous orbit) and the local horizontal. Under standard assumptions of the conservation of angular momentum the flight path angle



ϕ


{\displaystyle \phi }
satisfies the equation:




h

cos

ϕ


{\displaystyle h\,=r\,v\,\cos \phi }

where:




h



{\displaystyle h\,}
is the specific relative angular momentum of the orbit,




v



{\displaystyle v\,}
is the orbital speed of the orbiting body,




r



{\displaystyle r\,}
is the radial distance of the orbiting body from the central body,




ϕ



{\displaystyle \phi \,}
is the flight path angle




ψ


{\displaystyle \psi }
is the angle between the local horizontal and the semi-major axis.



ν


{\displaystyle \nu }
is the local true anomaly.

{\displaystyle \cos \phi =\sin(\psi -\nu )=\sin \psi \cos \nu -\cos \psi \sin \nu ={\frac {1+e\cos \nu }{\sqrt {1+e^{2}+2e\cos \nu }}}}

where



e


{\displaystyle e}
is the eccentricity.
The angular momentum is related to the vector cross product of position and velocity, which is proportional to the sine of the angle between these two vectors. Here



ϕ


{\displaystyle \phi }
is defined as the angle which differs by 90 degrees from this, so the cosine appears in place of the sine.
