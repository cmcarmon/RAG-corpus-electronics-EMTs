Each of these desiderata arises in studies within the ﬁeld of System Science, and this discipline would appear
to  provide  the  natural  formalism  for  quantitative  investigations  of  command  and  control  systems.  Athans
articulates this view by observing that C3 systems “are characterized by a high degree of complexity, a generic
distribution  of  the  decision-making  process  among  several  decision  making  ‘agents,’  the  need  for  reliable
operation in the presence of multiple failures, and the inevitable interaction of humans with computer-based
decision  support  systems  and  decision  aids”  [Athans, 1987].  It  needs  to  be  emphasized,  however,  that  a  C2
system differs from those commonly encountered in system theory in at least three primary ways:
