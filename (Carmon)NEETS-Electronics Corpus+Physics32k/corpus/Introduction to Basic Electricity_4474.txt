A latch is a device that serves as a temporary buf-
fer memory. It is used to hold data after the input sig-
nal is removed. The D flip-flop is a good example of a 
latch device. Other types of flip-flops can also be used.
A latch is used when inputting to a seven-segment 
display. Without a latch, the information being dis-
played is removed when the input signal is removed. 
With the latch, the information is displayed until it is 
updated.
