Absorption power meters absorb either all or part of the source power. They require means of 
dissipating the absorbed power, sensing the power thus dissipated, and indicating the amount of power 
absorbed by the sensing network. Output power meters, in-line wattmeters, and meters employing 
bolometers are examples of absorption power meters used by the Navy.
