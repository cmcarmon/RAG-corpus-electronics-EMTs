A synchro designed for 60-Hz operation may occasionally be used with a 400-Hz supply. There may 
be considerable loss of accuracy, but the synchro will not be damaged. This should be done only in the 
case of an emergency when the specified replacement is not available, and system accuracy is not critical.
