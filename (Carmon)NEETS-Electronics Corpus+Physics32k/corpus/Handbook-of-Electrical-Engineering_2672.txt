An individual device generation has been observed to have a reasonably well-deﬁned life cycle which covers
about 17 years. The ﬁrst year of volume manufacture is the reference point for a generation, but its lifetime
actually extends further in both directions. As shown in Fig. 25.2, one can think of the stages of maturity as
ranging  over  a  linear  scale  which  measures  years  to  production  in  both  the  plus  and  minus  directions.  The
17-year life cycle of a single generation, with new generations being introduced at 3-year intervals, means that
at  any  given  time  up  to  six  generations  are  being  worked  on.  This  tends  to  blur  the  signiﬁcance  of  research
news and company announcements unless the reader is sensitive to the technology overlap in time.
