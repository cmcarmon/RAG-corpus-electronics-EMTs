There is an arbitrariness in the choice of which particle's mass to use (whereas α is a function of the elementary charge, αG is normally a function of the electron rest mass). In this article αG is defined in terms of a pair of electrons unless stated otherwise. And while the relationship between αG and gravitation is somewhat analogous to that of the fine-structure constant and electromagnetism, the important difference is that the standard definition of αG describes a ratio in terms of electron mass alone, whereas the fine-structure constant relates to the elementary charge of both the proton and electron.
The electron is a stable particle possessing one elementary charge and one electron mass. Hence the ratio α/αG measures the relative strengths of the electrostatic and gravitational forces between two electrons. Expressed in natural units (so that 4πG = c = ħ = ε0 = 1), the constants become α = e2/4π and αG = me2/4π, resulting in a meaningful ratio α/αG = (e/me)2. Thus the ratio of the electron charge to the electron mass (in natural units) determines the relative strengths of electromagnetic and gravitational interaction between two electrons.
α is 43 orders of magnitude greater than αG calculated for two electrons (or 37 orders, for two protons). The electrostatic force between two charged elementary particles is vastly greater than the corresponding gravitational force between them. This is so because a charged elementary particle has in the order of one Planck charge, but a mass many orders of magnitude smaller than the Planck mass. The gravitational attraction among elementary particles, charged or not, can hence be ignored. Gravitation dominates for macroscopic objects because they are electrostatically neutral to a very high degree.
αG has a surprisingly simple physical interpretation: it is the square of the electron mass, measured in units of Planck mass. By virtue of this, αG is connected to the Higgs mechanism, which determines the rest masses of the elementary particles. αG can only be measured with relatively low precision, and is seldom mentioned in the physics literature.

where tP is the Planck time, αG is related to ωC, the Compton angular frequency of the electron.
