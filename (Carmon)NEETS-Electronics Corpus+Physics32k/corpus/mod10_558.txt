The vertical lines in the formula indicate that the enclosed quantities are absolute and that the two
values are taken without regard to polarity. Depending on the nature of the standing waves, the numerical
value of vswr ranges from a value of 1 (ZL = Z0, no standing waves) to an infinite value for theoretically
complete reflection. Since there is always a small loss on a line, the minimum voltage is never zero and
the vswr is always some finite value. However, if the vswr is to be a useful quantity, the power losses
along the line must be small in comparison to the transmitted power.
