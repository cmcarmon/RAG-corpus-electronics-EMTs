A 10-hp, 230-V, 500-r/min shunt motor, having a full-load armature current of 37 A, is started
with a four-point starter. The resistance of the armature circuit, including the interpole winding,
is 0.39 , and the resistances of the steps in the starting resistor are 1.56, 0.78, and 0.39 , in
the order in which they are successively cut out. When the armature current has dropped to its
rated value, the starting box is switched to the next point, thus eliminating a step at a time in the
starting resistance. Neglecting ﬁeld-current changes, armature reaction, and armature inductance,
ﬁnd the initial and ﬁnal values of the armature current and speed corresponding to each step.
