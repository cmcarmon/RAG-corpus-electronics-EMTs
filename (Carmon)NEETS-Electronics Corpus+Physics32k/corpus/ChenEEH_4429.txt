One important thing to be noted here is that, in the case of
inherently passive systems, the use of an MSPR controller
guarantees stability robustness to unmodeled dynamics and
parametric uncertainties; however, in the case of nonpassive
systems that are rendered passive using passifying compen-
sation, stability robustness depends on the robustness of the
passiﬁcation. That is, the problem of robust stability is trans-
formed into the problem of robust passiﬁcation. In Kelkar
and Joshi (1998) a number of sufﬁcient conditions are derived
to check the robustness of the passiﬁcation.
