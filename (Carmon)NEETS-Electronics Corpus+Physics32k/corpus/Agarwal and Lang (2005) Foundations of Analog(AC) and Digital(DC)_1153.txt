Referring to Figure 8.22, we can compute the power gain as follows: We apply
a small test voltage at the input and measure the input current itest. We also
measure the corresponding output voltage vo and output current io supplied to
the external load resistor. We compute the power supplied by the input source
as vtestitest. Similarly, we compute the power supplied to the external load as
voio. As we did for the current gain, let us assume that the amplifier has an
input resistance Ri. The power gain is given by
