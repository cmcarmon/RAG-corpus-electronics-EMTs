This is plotted against several real disk products in Fig. 80.10. Magnetic disk technology has doubled capacity
and halved price every three years, in line with the growth rate of semiconductor memory. Between 1967 and
1979 the growth in disk capacity of the average IBM data processing system more than kept up with its growth
in main memory, maintaining a ratio of 1000:1 between disk capacity and physical memory size [Stevens, 1981].
In contrast to primary memory technologies, the performance of conventional magnetic disks has improved
 devices, the elements of which are described in more detail in the next section,
only modestly. These 
are  dominated  by  seek  and  rotation  delays:  from  1971  to  1981,  the  raw  seek  time  for  a  high-end  IBM  disk
improved by only a factor of two while the rotation time did not change [Harker et al., 1981]. Greater recording
density translates into a higher transfer rate once the information is located, and extra positioning actuators
 can reduce the average seek time, but the raw seek time only improved at a rate of
for the read/write 
7% per year. This is to be compared to a doubling in processor power every year, a doubling in memory density
every two years, and a doubling in disk density every three years. The gap between processor performance and
disk speeds continues to widen, and there is no reason to expect a radical improvement in raw disk performance
in the near future.
