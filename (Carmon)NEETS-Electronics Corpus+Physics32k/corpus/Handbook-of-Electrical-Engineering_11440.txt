There are numerous detector types in the general category of room-temperature detectors: those capable of
ambient  temperature  operation  (true  room-temperature  devices)  and  those  requiring  cooling  to  the  region  of
–30°C.  The  former  group  includes  wide  bandgap  materials  such  as  cadmium  zinc  telluride,  mercuric  iodide,
cadmium telluride, and a number of silicon structures. The latter group consist primarily of p-intrinsic-n (PIN)
silicon devices. As a group, room-temperature detectors are employed mainly in X-ray and gamma-ray spectros-
copy, although silicon surface barrier and ion-implanted devices are highly valued for charge particle spectroscopy.
