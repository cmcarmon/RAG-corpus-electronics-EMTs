Figure 3-22 illustrates a flow calorimeter using low-frequency power substitution. Two different 
measurement techniques are possible with this type of meter: the calibration technique and the balance 
technique. The CALIBRATION TECHNIQUE uses an adjustable known power to exactly reproduce the 
same temperature indication originally obtained by the unknown rf power measurement. The BALANCE 
TECHNIQUE uses an initial low-frequency power (P1) to provide a steady-state temperature rise in the 
calorimetric fluid. When unknown rf power is applied, the original power (P 1) is reduced to a new power 
(P2) to maintain the same temperature indication. Therefore, the actual power equals P1 minus P 2. Figure 
3-23 illustrates a widely used method of power measurement using a balanced-flow calorimeter. 
Temperature-sensitive resistors are bridge-connected as the thermometric elements and are balanced at 
ambient temperature prior to the application of power. Low-frequency balancing power and the unknown
