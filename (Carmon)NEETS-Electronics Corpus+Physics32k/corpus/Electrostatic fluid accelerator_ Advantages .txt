The typical cooling fan is limited by noise and wear due to their high-speed moving parts. They also may suffer from inefficiency resulting in higher power requirements and a given fan may have a limited range of uses because they operate at a fixed speed and have a fixed blade geometry â€“ i.e., the amount of airflow cannot be varied. Turbulence introduced by fan blades is one of the leading causes of inefficiency and vibration.
Potential advantages of EFA cooling devices include improvement on all these issues; EFA fans produce no vibration and have no parts to wear out. Their power consumption and airflow are controllable electronically, allowing them to be run in an optimal fashion to maximize cooling and efficiency. In particular, EFA fans can produce flow which is fairly laminar, and the velocity profile of the flow can be controlled to a much greater extent than conventional fans. Control of the airflow may have the most important impact on cooling effectiveness. Electrostatically accelerated flows have been shown experimentally to alter the boundary layer along a fixed surface so that the heat transfer rate is increased, in some cases by more than twofold.
