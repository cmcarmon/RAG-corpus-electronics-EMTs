Although you can find SMT components and SMT‐compatible prototyping 
breadboards, they are challenging to work with because the components 
are tiny, their leads are even tinier, and it’s difficult to keep the components 
in place while soldering. That’s why I recommend you stick to perfboards, 
which are relatively inexpensive through‐hole boards specifically designed 
for prototyping.
