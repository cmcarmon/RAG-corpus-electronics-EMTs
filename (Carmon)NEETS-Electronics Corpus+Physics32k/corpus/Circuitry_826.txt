The  program  is  to  simulate  the  operation  of  a 
PIC16F877A  microcontroller  and  is  to  read  an 
analogue voltage present on the AN0 analog input 
and  display  the  8-bit  binary  conversion  result  on 
PORTB.  
  The analogue-to-digital converter (ADC) BASIC 
source  code  used  in  the  Practical  investigation 
(shown in Table 18.4) is available for downloading 
from the companion website (see page 415). 
 
Procedure 
 
Start  the  PIC  Simulator  (see  Fig.  18.17),  click  on 
Options and then Select Microcontroller. Select the
