Given that multiple regions in the image can be annotated, the
transcoding of images needs to consider the individual im-
portance and spatial resolution hint for each region (Smith
and Reddy, 2001). Overall, this can be approached as an
optimization problem in which the image needs to be manipu-
lated, such as through cropping and rescaling, to produce an
output image that maximizes the overall content value given
the constraints on its delivery. The optimization problem is
expressed as follows: The device imposes a constraint on the
size of the image (i.e., size of the screen). The transcoding
engine seeks to maximize the beneÔ¨Åt derived from the content
value of the transcoded image. The problem, thus, is to maxi-
mize the total content value given the constraints.
