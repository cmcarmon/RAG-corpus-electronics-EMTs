For instance, you can piggyback two bipolar transistors in a setup known as 
a Darlington pair to produce multiple stages of amplification. (In the section 
“Gaining Experience with Transistors,” later in this chapter, you find out how 
to configure a simple Darlington pair.) Or you can get the same result the 
easy way: Purchase a three‐lead component called a Darlington transistor, 
which includes a Darlington pair already hooked up.
