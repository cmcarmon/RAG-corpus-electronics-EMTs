EXAMPLE 8.4.1
A JFET for which VA = 80 V, VP = 4 V, and IDSS = 10 mA has a quiescent drain current of 3
mA when used as a common-source ampliﬁer for which RD = RSS = 1 k and RL = 3 k. For
the case of fully bypassed RSS, ﬁnd the ampliﬁer’s voltage gain Av1. Also determine the current
gain Ai if R1 = 300 k and R2 = 100 k.
