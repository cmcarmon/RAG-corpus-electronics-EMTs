2. This discussion concerning the LTE suggests that if
a discretization formula is used that matches more
than two terms in the Taylor series expansion, then
more accurate results will be obtained. This is also
correct, provided the same step size is used for both
discretization methods, or alternatively the second
method will allow larger step sizes for a given error.
