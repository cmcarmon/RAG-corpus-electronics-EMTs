The SCHOTTKY BARRIER DIODE is actually a variation of the point-contact diode in which the 
metal semiconductor junction is a surface rather than a point contact. The large contact area, or barrier, 
between the metal and the semiconductor in the Schottky barrier diode provides some advantages over the 
point-contact diode. Lower forward resistance and lower noise generation are the most important 
advantages of the Schottky barrier diode. The applications of the Schottky barrier diode are the same as 
those of the point-contact diode. The low noise level generated by Schottky diodes makes them especially 
suitable as microwave receiver detectors and mixers.
