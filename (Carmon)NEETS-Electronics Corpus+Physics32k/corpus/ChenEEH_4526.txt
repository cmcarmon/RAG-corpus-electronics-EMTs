This chapter discusses the identiﬁcation of linear dynamic
systems using frequency domain measurement data. After
outlining a general modeling procedure,
the two major
computation steps,
frequency domain curve-ﬁtting and
state-space system realization, are illustration with detailed
numerical routines. The algorithms employ TFM models in
the form of matrix fraction or polynomial matrix and re-
quire respectively linear or nonlinear parameter optimiza-
tions. Finally,
the proposed identiﬁcation schemes are
validated through the modeling of two experimental test
structures.
