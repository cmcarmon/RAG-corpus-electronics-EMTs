by electron loss to the semiconductor substrate is possible, leaving the dye molecule as an oxidized species. The
original ground state of the dye is restored by charge transfer reactions with the redox electrolyte. The solar
cell circuit is completed by a metallized counterelectrode at which a reduction reaction with a redox system
takes place. Research cells with better than 10% efﬁciency have been conﬁrmed. Such cells have substantially
better conversion efﬁciencies at lower light intensity levels. The technology is promising because it involves a
low-cost processing of large areas. The solar cell continues to show growth in performance and in stability, a
parameter that has been of concern to research and manufacturing groups. This technology is still in its infancy,
and represents one area of thin ﬁlms that is an alternative to conventional junction solar cell approaches.
