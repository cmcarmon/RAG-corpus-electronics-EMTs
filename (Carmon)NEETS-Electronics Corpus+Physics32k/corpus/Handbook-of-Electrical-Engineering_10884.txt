Transition From Basic to Advanced Use
The  user  of  a  CACSD  package  is  faced  with  two  different  types  of  complexity:  the  complexity  of  the  user
interface and the complexity of the underlying theory and algorithms. In both cases extra guidance is needed
for  novice  users.  Typically,  the  designers  of  CACSD  packages  do  not  wish  to  stand  in  the  way  of  the  expert
users,  so  they  provide  direct  access  to  the  whole  package  and  interfere  in  the  use  of  the  package  as  little  as
possible. This creates problems for novice or infrequent users of the packageâ€”novices because they are coming
to  the  package  without  any  knowledge  of  it,  infrequent  users  because  they  have  probably  forgotten  most  of
what they learned the last time they used the package.
