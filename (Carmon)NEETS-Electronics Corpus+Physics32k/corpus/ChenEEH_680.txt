Synchronous DRAMs (SDRAM) can have a larger pipeline
that provides a huge theoretical bandwidth. Basically, the
internal state machine enables to enlarge the pipeline. An
SDRAM can sustain this high throughput rate by data access
interleaving over several banks. However, the address needs to
be known several cycles prior to when the data are actually
needed. Otherwise the data path will stall, canceling the
advantage of the pipelined memory. As already mentioned,
modern stand-alone DRAM chips, which are often of this
SDRAM type, also offer low-power solutions, but this comes
at a price. Internally they contain banks and a small cache with
a (very) wide width connected to the external high-speed bus
