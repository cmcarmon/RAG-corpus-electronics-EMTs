What Is the Signiﬁcance of Controlled Sources?
Commonplace  wisdom  in  engineering  education  and  practice  is  that  information  and  techniques  that  are
presented visually are more useful than abstract, mathematical forms. Equivalent circuits are universally used
in  describing  electrical  engineering  systems  and  devices  because  circuits  portray  interactions  in  a  universal,
pictorial language. This is true generally, and it is doubly necessary when circuit variables interact through the
mysterious coupling modeled by controlled sources. This is the primary signiﬁcance of controlled sources: that
they represent unusual couplings of circuit variables in the universal, visual language of circuits.
