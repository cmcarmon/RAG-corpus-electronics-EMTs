To illustrate the usefulness of retiming, consider the data ﬂow graph of a two-stage pipelined lattice digital
ﬁlter graph shown in Fig. 18.3(a) and its equivalent pipelined-retimed data ﬂow graph shown in Fig. 18.3(b).
If the multiply time is two units and the add time is one unit, the architecture in Fig. 18.3(a) can be clocked
with period 10 units whereas the architecture in Fig. 18.3(b) can be clocked with period 2 units.
