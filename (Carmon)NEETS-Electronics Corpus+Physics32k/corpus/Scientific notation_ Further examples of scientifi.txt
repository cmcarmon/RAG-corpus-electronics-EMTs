An electron's mass is about 0.000000000000000000000000000000910938356 kg. In scientific notation, this is written 9.10938356×10−31 kg (in SI units).
The Earth's mass is about 5972400000000000000000000 kg. In scientific notation, this is written 5.9724×1024 kg.
The Earth's circumference is approximately 40000000 m. In scientific notation, this is 4×107 m. In engineering notation, this is written 40×106 m. In SI writing style, this may be written "40 Mm" (40 megameters).
An inch is defined as exactly 25.4 mm. Quoting a value of 25.400 mm shows that the value is correct to the nearest micrometer. An approximated value with only two significant digits would be 2.5×101 mm instead. As there is no limit to the number of significant digits, the length of an inch could, if required, be written as (say) 2.54000000000×101 mm instead.
