oscillations are due to the changing angle of attack; eventually,
if allowed to run uncontrolled, the system diverges. The solid
line in Figure 12.3 corresponds to the ﬁrst design just de-
scribed. Notice that x1 has an overshoot beyond zero. In Figure
12.4(A), we can see the evolution of the angle of attack. In
Figure 12.4(B), we observe the control input generated by this
ﬁrst design.
