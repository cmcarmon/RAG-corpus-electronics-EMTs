The behavior of pipe flow is governed mainly by the effects of viscosity and gravity relative to the inertial forces of the flow. Depending on the effect of viscosity relative to inertia, as represented by the Reynolds number, the flow can be either laminar or turbulent. At a Reynolds number below the critical value of approximately 2040 pipe flow will ultimately be laminar, whereas above the critical value turbulent flow can persist. In addition, the transition between laminar flow and turbulence can be sensitive to disturbance levels and imperfections.
Flow through pipes can roughly be divided into two:
Laminar flow - see Hagen-Poiseuille flow
Turbulent flow - see Moody diagram
