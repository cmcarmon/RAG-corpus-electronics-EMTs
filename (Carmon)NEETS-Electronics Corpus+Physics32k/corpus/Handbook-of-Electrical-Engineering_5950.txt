Once the motor is rotating, the second design concept allows that one of the phases, the auxiliary one, be
disconnected. The current in the remaining main winding alone produces only a pulsating ﬂux, which can be
analyzed as the sum of two rotating ﬁelds of equal amplitude but opposite direction. These ﬁelds, as seen from
the moving rotor, rotate at different speeds, hence inducing in it currents of different frequency and amplitude.
If the speed of the rotor is wr , the applied frequency to the stator is f and the number of pole pairs in the motor
is p, the frequencies of the currents induced in the rotor are pwr – f and pwr + f. These unequal currents in
turn produce unequal torques in the two directions, with a nonzero net torque.
