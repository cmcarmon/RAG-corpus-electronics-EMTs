The absolute maximum junction temperature rating 
(150Â°C) is exceeded and the designer should either 
reduce  the  power  dissipation  to  a  safe  value  or 
reduce the thermal resistance present (or both!).  
 
Determining heatsink specifications 
 
The  electronic  equipment  designer  often  has  to 
determine 
the  required  heatsink  specifications 
given the absolute maximum junction temperature, 
thermal resistance from junction to case, maximum 
expected ambient temperature, etc. To do this,  we 
need  to  rearrange  equation  (6)  to  make  (cid:4)SA  the 
subject of the equation. Thus:
