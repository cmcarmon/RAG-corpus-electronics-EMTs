Divergent thinking allows a group to generate many 
new ideas in a short timeframe. It encourages and sug-
gests a number of possible solutions by using a concept 
that no idea is outrageous and that there are no bad ideas. 
Divergent thinking allows the largest number of ideas that 
are not tied to any constraints, limitations, or judgment.
