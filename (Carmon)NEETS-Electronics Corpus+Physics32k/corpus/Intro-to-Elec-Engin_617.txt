*6.2.27 Counting to moduli other than 2n is a frequent
requirement, the most common being to count
through the binary-coded decimal (BCD) 8421 se-
quence. All that is required is a four-stage counter
which, having counted from 0000 to 1001 (i.e.,
decimal 0 to 9; ten states), resets to 0000 on the
next clock pulse. Develop a block diagram of an
asynchronous decade counter and show its timing
diagram.
