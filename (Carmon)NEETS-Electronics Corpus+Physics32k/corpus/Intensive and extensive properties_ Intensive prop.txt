An intensive property is a physical quantity whose value does not depend on the amount of the substance for which it is measured. For example, the temperature of a system in thermal equilibrium is the same as the temperature of any part of it. If the system is divided the temperature of each subsystem is identical. The same applies to the density of a homogeneous system; if the system is divided in half, the mass and the volume change in the identical ratio and the density remains unchanged. Additionally, the boiling point of a substance is another example of an intensive property. For example, the boiling point of water is 100 Â°C at a pressure of one atmosphere, which remains true regardless of quantity.
The distinction between intensive and extensive properties has some theoretical uses. For example, in thermodynamics, according to the state postulate:-"The state of a simple compressible system is completely specified by two independent, intensive properties". Other intensive properties are derived from those two variables.
