The  text  article  emphasizes  the  dynamic  behavior  of  the  human,  not  the  design  of  machine  dynamics  to
achieve optimum characteristics in terms of man-machine system dynamic performance and human subjective
approval. For these aspects of design, a comprehensive summary of models, references, and applications appears
  1988.  Although  the  applications  there  are
in “Advances  in  Flying  Qualities,” 
speciﬁcally  for  aerospace  vehicle  control,  the  principles  illustrated  apply  to  vehicles  in  general  and  to  other
machines subject to continuous control by a human operator.
