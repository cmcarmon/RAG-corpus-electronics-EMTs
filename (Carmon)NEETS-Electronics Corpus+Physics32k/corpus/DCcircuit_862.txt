Notice now how the indicator is an ammeter rather than a voltmeter (the scale calibrated
in inches, feet, or meters of water in the tank, as always). Because the circuit is a series
conÔ¨Åguration (accounting for the cable resistances), current will be precisely equal through all
components. With or without cable resistance, the current at the indicator is exactly the same
as the current at the transmitter, and therefore there is no error incurred as there might be
with a voltage signal system. This assurance of zero signal degradation is a decided advantage
of current signal systems over voltage signal systems.
