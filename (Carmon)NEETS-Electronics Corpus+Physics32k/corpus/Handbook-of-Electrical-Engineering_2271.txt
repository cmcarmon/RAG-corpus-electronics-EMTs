electric ﬁeld, E, which at equilibrium prevents a further diffusion of carriers across the junction. This equilib-
rium  can  be  regarded  as  the  ﬂow  of  two  equal  and  opposite  currents  across  the  junction,  such  that  the  net
current across the junction is equal to zero. Thus, one component represents the diffusion of carriers across
the junction and the other component represents the drift of carriers across the junction due to the electric
ﬁeld E in the junction. The barrier voltage V0 is, according to the Boltzmann relation, [Grove, 1967; Foustad,
