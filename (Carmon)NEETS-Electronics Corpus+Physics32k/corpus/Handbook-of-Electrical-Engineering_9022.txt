Ionographic Printing
Ionographic printer devices also use powder toner technology and the overall technology is very similar to EP.
One  major  difference,  however,  is  the  creation  of  the  electrostatic  image  for  subsequent  toner  development.
The  ionographic  process  uses  an  ion  source  (high-voltage  drive  electrode)  and  a  page-wide  array  of  control
and  screen  electrodes  to  gate  ions  directed  toward  a  drum  coated  with  a  thin-ﬁlm  dielectric  material  (e.g.,
Al2O3), thus creating a charged image on the drum. In present commercial ionographic printers, the transfer
and fuse steps of EP are also replaced with a “transﬁx” process where the paper sheet is squeezed between the
toner-developed dielectric drum and a compliant cold pressure roll. The ionographic technology has two fewer
process steps (vis-à-vis EP) but the ion printhead represents signiﬁcant technical challenges (cost and lifetime).
