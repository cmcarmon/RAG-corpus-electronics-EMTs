The high magnetic energy stored in rare-earth-cobalt permanent magnets allows the design of
lightweight motors and magnetic bearings for high-speed rotors. Magnetic bearings are not subject
to wear, and with the ability to operate under high vacuum conditions, they appear to be ideal for
applications requiring high rotational speeds, such as 100,000 r/min. Important applications are
for turbomolecular pumps, laser scanners, centrifuges, momentum rings for satellite stabilizations,
and other uses in space technology.
