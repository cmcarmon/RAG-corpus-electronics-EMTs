Figure 9.22 shows the same n-channel MOSFET with its source and sub-
strate grounded, and positive voltages applied to its gate and drain. As the
positive gate voltage is applied, electrons flow from the source into the channel
and accumulate beneath the gate. When the gate voltage exceeds the threshold
voltage of the MOSFET, the electron density beneath the gate becomes suffi-
ciently high to invert the channel from p-type silicon to n-type silicon. Thus, a
continuous n-type channel forms between the source and drain, thereby allow-
ing electrons to flow from the source to the drain, and hence current to flow
from the drain to the source, in the response to the positive drain voltage.
