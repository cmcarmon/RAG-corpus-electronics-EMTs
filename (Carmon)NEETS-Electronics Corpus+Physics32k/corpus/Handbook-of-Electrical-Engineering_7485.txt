Computer simulation: A set of computer programs which allows one to imitate the important aspects of the
behavior  of  the  speciÔ¨Åc  system  under  study.  Simulation  can  aid  the  design  process  by,  for  example,
allowing  one  to  determine  appropriate  system  design  parameters  or  aid  the  analysis  process  by,  for
example, allowing one to estimate the end-to-end performance of the system under study.
