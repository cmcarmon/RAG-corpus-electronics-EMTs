Simpliﬁcation of an n-variable Boolean function by using a K map is achieved by grouping
adjacent cells that contain 1s. The number of adjacent cells that may be grouped is always equal
to 2m, for 0 ≤ m ≤ n, i.e., 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, . . . cells. Such a group or set of 2m cells is called a
subcube and is expressed by the product term containing only the variables that are common to
the adjacent cells. The larger the subcube is, the fewer variables are needed to express the product
term. This statement can be justiﬁed by using Boolean identities. For example, in a four-variable
K map, the following possible subcubes can be formed.
• 1-cell subcube (having one minterm) expressed by a product term containing four, or n− m,
variables; note that n = 4 and m = 0 for this case.
• 2-cell subcube (having two minterms) expressed by a product term containing three, or
n − m, variables; note that n = 4 and m = 1 for this case.
• 4-cell subcube (having four minterms) expressed by a product term containing two, or
n − m, variables; note that n = 4 and m = 2 for this case.
• 8-cell subcube (having eight minterms) expressed by a product term containing one or n−m
variables; note that n = 4 and m = 3 for this case.
• 16-cell subcube (having sixteen minterms) expressed by the logic 1; that is, the function is
