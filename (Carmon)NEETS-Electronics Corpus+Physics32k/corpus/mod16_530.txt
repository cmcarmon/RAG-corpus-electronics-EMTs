EXT D-Q terminals are normally connected with a shorting lug. They allow an external rheostat to
extend the range of the D-Q dial. EXT GEN terminals provide a connection to the bridge for an external
generator. When the GEN-DET switch is in the AC EXT GEN position, the terminals connect an isolation
transformer so that a grounded external generator can be used. When the GEN-DET switch is in the DC
EXT GEN position, the terminals are connected directly to the bridge.
