It can be shown that the set of conjugate-symmetric sequences Ccs is a closed vector space. Moreover, the set
of nonnegative deﬁnite sequences Cnnd is a closed convex cone subset of Ccs.
Normed Vector Space Formulation
The  primary  objective  of  this  paper  is  to  present  several  algorithms  which  have  been  proposed  for  solving
optimization  problem  (14.69)  using  an  iterative  approach.  These  algorithms  take  on  a  similar  form  and  are
distinguished by the algebraic restrictions placed on the underlying attribute subsets. To provide for a satisfac-
tory mathematical characterization of the restoration problem and its solution, it is essential that we provide
an  algebraic  structure  to  the  underlying  metric  space.  In  particular,  the  ability  to  add  vectors  and  multiply
vectors  by  scalars  provides  a  useful  means  for  interpreting  the  measurement  signal  and  more  importantly
considerably increases the arsenal of analysis tools at our disposal. Fortunately, little loss in generality is incurred
by  introducing  these  two  algebraic  operations  since  in  most  signal  processing  applications  of  interest  there
exists an intuitively obvious means for their implementation. For example, if the metric space is taken to be
Rn (or C n), then the sum of any two vectors x,y ˛Rn (or  Cn) has as its  kth component x(k) + y(k), while the
scalar product ax has as its  k th component  ax(k) for 1 £  k £  n.
