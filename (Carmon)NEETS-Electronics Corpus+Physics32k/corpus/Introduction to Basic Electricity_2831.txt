In a transformer, the coil containing the AC volt-
age is referred to as the primary	winding. The other 
coil, in which the voltage is induced, is referred to as 
the secondary	winding. The amount of voltage 
induced depends on the amount of mutual induction 
between the two coils. The amount of mutual induc-
tion is determined by the coefficient	of	coupling. 
The coefficient of coupling is a number from 0 to 1, 
with 1 indicating that all the primary flux lines cut the 
secondary windings and 0 indicating that none of the 
primary flux lines cut the windings.
