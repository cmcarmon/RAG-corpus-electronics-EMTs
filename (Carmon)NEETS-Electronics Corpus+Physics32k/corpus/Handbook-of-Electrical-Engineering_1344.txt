Standardization
 ensures the interoperability of
The presence of international, national, and regional speech coding 
coders among various implementations. As noted previously, several standard algorithms exist among the classes
of  speech  coders.  The  ITU-T  (formerly  CCITT)  has  historically  been  a  dominant  factor  in  international
standardization of speech coders, such as G.711, G.721, G.728, G.729, etc. Additionally, the emergence of digital
cellular telephony, personal communications networks, and multimedia communications has driven the for-
mulation of various national or regional standard algorithms such as the GSM full and half-rate standards for
European  digital  cellular,  the  CTIA  full-rate  TDMA  and  CDMA  algorithms  and  their  half-rate  counterparts
for U.S. digital cellular, full and half-rate Pitch-Synchronous CELP [Miki et al., 1993] for Japanese cellular, as
well as speech coders for particular applications [ITU-TS, 1991].
