Within the framework of liquid drop model, the criterion for whether spontaneous fission can occur in a time short enough to be observed by present methods, is approximately:







Z

2


A


â‰¥
47.


{\displaystyle {\frac {Z^{2}}{A}}\geq 47.}

where Z is the atomic number and A is the mass number (e.g., Z2/A = 36 for uranium-235).
