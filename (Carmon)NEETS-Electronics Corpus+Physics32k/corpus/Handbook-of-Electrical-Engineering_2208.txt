The  various  contributors  to  this  section  have  done  an  outstanding  job  of  providing  concise  and  practical
coverage of this immense ﬁeld. By necessity, the content ranges from rather theoretical considerations, such as
physical principles of semiconductors, to quite practical issues such as printed circuit board technology and
, such as
circuits for active ﬁlter realizations. There are areas of overlap with other chapters in the 
those covering electrical effects and devices, biomedical electronics, digital devices, and computers. The con-
tributors  to  this  section,  however,  have  maintained  a  focus  on  providing  practical  and  useful  information
directly related to electronics as needed by a practicing electrical engineer.
