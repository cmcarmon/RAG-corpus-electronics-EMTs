7.88 The circuit in Fig. 7.148(a) can be designed as
an approximate differentiator or an integrator,
depending on whether the output is taken across
the resistor or the capacitor, and also on the time
constant 
of the circuit and the width T of
the input pulse in Fig. 7.148(b). The circuit is a
differentiator if 
integrator if
