Example A7.3 
 
An amplifier provides a power gain of 33 dB. What 
output power will be produced if an input of 2 mW 
is applied? 
 
Solution 
 
Here we must re-arrange the formula to make Pout 
the subject, as follows: 
 
Av = 10 log10(Pout/Pin)
thus 
 
Ap/10 = log10(Pout/Pin)
or 
 
antilog10(Ap/10) = Pout/Pin
