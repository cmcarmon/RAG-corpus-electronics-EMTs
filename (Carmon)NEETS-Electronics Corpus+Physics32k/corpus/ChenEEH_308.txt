Under a larger positive gate bias, the positive charge on the
gate increases further, and the oxide Ô¨Åeld begins to collect
thermally generated electrons under the gate. With electrons,
the intrinsic surface begins to change into an n-type inversion
layer. The negative charge in the semiconductor is comprised
of ionized acceptor atoms in the depletion region and free
electrons in the inversion layer. As noted above, at this point,
the electron concentration at the surface is still less than the
