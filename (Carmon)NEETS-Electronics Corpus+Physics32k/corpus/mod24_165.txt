Attenuation reduces the amount of optical power transmitted by the fiber. Attenuation controls the
distance an optical signal (pulse) can travel as shown in figure 2-19. Once the power of an optical pulse is
reduced to a point where the receiver is unable to detect the pulse, an error occurs. Attenuation is mainly a
result of light absorption, scattering, and bending losses. Dispersion spreads the optical pulse as it
travels along the fiber. This spreading of the signal pulse reduces the system bandwidth or the
information-carrying capacity of the fiber. Dispersion limits how fast information is transferred as shown
in figure 2-19. An error occurs when the receiver is unable to distinguish between input pulses caused by
the spreading of each pulse. The effects of attenuation and dispersion increase as the pulse travels the
length of the fiber as shown in figure 2-20.
