Apparent power is the power that appears to the source because of the circuit impedance. Since the 
impedance is the total opposition to ac, the apparent power is that power the voltage source "sees." 
Apparent power is the combination of true power and reactive power. Apparent power is not found by 
simply adding true power and reactive power just as impedance is not found by adding resistance and 
reactance.
