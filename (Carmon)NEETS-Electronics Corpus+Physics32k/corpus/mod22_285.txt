Other languages gaining in popularity are PASCAL and Ada. PASCAL is being used by many 
colleges and universities to teach programming because it is fairly easy to learn; yet is a more powerful 
language than BASIC. Although PASCAL is not yet a standardized language, it is still used rather 
extensively on microcomputers. It has greater programming capabilities on small computers than are 
possible with BASIC.
