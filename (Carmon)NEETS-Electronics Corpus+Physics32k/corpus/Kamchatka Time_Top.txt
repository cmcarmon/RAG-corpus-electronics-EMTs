Kamchatka Time (PETT) (Russian: Камчатское время, Kamchatskoye vremya), also known as Anadyr Time (ANAT), is a time zone in Russia, named after the Kamchatka Peninsula. It is 12 hours ahead of UTC (UTC+12) and 9 hours ahead of Moscow Time (MSK+9). This time zone is used in the two easternmost regions of Russia after October 2014 and was also used before the time zone reform of 2010.
Kamchatka Summer Time (PETST) corresponded to UTC+13, but still 9 hours ahead of Moscow (MSD+9). This no longer exists, effective in the 2014 change.
On March 28, 2010, while most regions of Russia switched to Summer Time moving the clocks one hour forward, the two Russian regions using Kamchatka Time, Kamchatka Krai and Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, retained UTC+12, effectively joining Magadan Summer Time. This change was reversed on 26 October 2014.
