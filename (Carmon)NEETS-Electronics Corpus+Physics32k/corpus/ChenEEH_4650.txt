Gain-scheduling methods for LPV systems have emerged
only recently. The relationship between gain scheduling via lin-
earization and parameter-dependent systems is explained in
Shamma and Athans (1990, 1991). Early work on parameter-
dependent controllers is covered in Kamen and Khargonekar
(1984); more recently, parameter-dependent synthesis ap-
proaches based on Lyapunov and small-gain techniques have
appeared (Becker and Packard, 1994; Packard, 1994; Apkarian
and Gahinet, 1995) and frame the synthesis problem as a
convex optimization problem. These approaches generalize
H1 techniques for LTI systems to LPV systems. Other
methods are described in Apkarian and Adams (1998) and
Apkarian et al. (1995).
