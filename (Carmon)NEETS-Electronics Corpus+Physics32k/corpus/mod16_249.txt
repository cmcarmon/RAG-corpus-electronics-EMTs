reading frequency meter. Frequency comparisons can be made by the use of a calibrated af generator in
conjunction with either an oscilloscope or a modulator and a zero-beat indicating device. Direct-reading
frequency measurements can be made by instruments using series, frequency-selective electrical
networks, bridge test sets having null indicators, or counting-type frequency meters.
