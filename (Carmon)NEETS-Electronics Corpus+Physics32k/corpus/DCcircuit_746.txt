resistance reading. If the battery voltage decreases (as all chemical batteries do with age and
use), the ohmmeter scale will lose accuracy. With the series range resistor at a constant value
of 8.5 kΩ and the battery voltage decreasing, the meter will no longer deﬂect full-scale to the
right when the test leads are shorted together (0 Ω). Likewise, a test resistance of 9 kΩ will
fail to deﬂect the needle to exactly 1/2 scale with a lesser battery voltage.
