High-pass ﬁlter: A ﬁlter whose band extends from some ﬁnite cut-off frequency to inﬁnity.
Impedance  scaling: Modifying  a  ﬁlter  circuit  to  change  from  a  normalized  set  of  element  values  to  other
usually more practical element values by multiplying all impedances by a constant equal to the ratio of
the desired (scaled) impedance to the normalized impedance.
