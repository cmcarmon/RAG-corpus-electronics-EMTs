A projective representation Π(G) of a Lie group G (background) can be used to define a so-called group extension Gex.
In quantum mechanics, Wigner's theorem asserts that if G is a symmetry group, then it will be represented projectively on Hilbert space by unitary or antiunitary operators. This is often dealt with by passing to the universal covering group of G and take it as the symmetry group. This works nicely for the rotation group SO(3) and the Lorentz group O(3, 1), but it does not work when the symmetry group is the Galilean group. In this case one has to pass to its central extension, the Bargmann group, which is the symmetry group of the Schrödinger equation. Likewise, if G = ℝ2n, the group of translations in position and momentum space, one has to pass to its central extension, the Heisenberg group.
Let ω be the 2-cocycle on G induced by Π. Define

{\displaystyle (\lambda _{1},g_{1})(\lambda _{2},g_{2})=(\lambda _{1}\lambda _{2}\omega (g_{1},g_{2}),g_{1}g_{2}).}

Associativity holds since ω is a 2-cocycle on G. One has for the unit element

{\displaystyle (\lambda ,g)^{-1}=\left({\frac {1}{\lambda \omega (g,g^{-1})}},g^{-1}\right).}

The set (ℂ*, e) is an abelian subgroup of Gex. This means that Gex is not semisimple. The center of G, Z(G) = {z ∈ G|zg = gz ∀g ∈ G} includes this subgroup. The center may be larger.
At the level of Lie algebras it can be shown that the Lie algebra gex of Gex is given by

{\displaystyle [\mu C+G_{1},\nu C+G_{2}]=[G_{1},G_{2}]+\eta (G_{1},G_{2})C.}

Here η is a 2-cocycle on g. This 2-cocycle can be obtained from ω albeit in a highly nontrivial way.
Now by using the projective representation Π one may define a map Πex by

{\displaystyle \Pi _{\mathrm {ex} }((\lambda ,g))=\lambda \Pi (g).}

It has the properties

{\displaystyle \Pi _{\mathrm {ex} }((\lambda _{1},g_{1}))\Pi _{\mathrm {ex} }((\lambda _{2},g_{2}))=\lambda _{1}\lambda _{2}\Pi (g_{1})\Pi (g_{2})=\lambda _{1}\lambda _{2}\omega (g_{1},g_{2})\Pi (g_{1}g_{2})=\Pi _{\mathrm {ex} }(\lambda _{1}\lambda _{2}\omega (g_{1},g_{2}),g_{1}g_{2})=\Pi _{\mathrm {ex} }((\lambda _{1},g_{1})(\lambda _{2},g_{2})),}

so Πex(Gex) is a bona fide representation of Gex.
In the context of Wigner's theorem, the situation may be depicted as such (replace ℂ* by U(1)); let SH denote the unit sphere in Hilbert space H, and let (·,·) be its inner product. Let PH denote ray space and [·,·] the ray product. Let moreover a wiggly arrow denote a group action. Then the diagram

commutes, i.e.

{\displaystyle \pi _{2}\circ \Pi _{\mathrm {ex} }((\lambda ,g))(\psi )=\Pi \circ \pi (g)(\pi _{1}(\psi )),\quad \psi \in S{\mathcal {H}}.}

Moreover, in the same way that G is a symmetry of PH preserving [·,·], Gex is a symmetry of SH preserving (·,·). The fibers of π2 are all circles. These circles are left invariant under the action of U(1). The action of U(1) on these fibers is transitive with no fixed point. The conclusion is that SH is a principal fiber bundle over PH with structure group U(1).
