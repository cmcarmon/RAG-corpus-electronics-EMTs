There is an association between the amount of time a mother works and her child’s body mass index (BMI). There is evidence that nonstandard maternal work schedules, meaning those that fall at least partially outside the “traditional” range of 9:00 am to 5:00 pm on Monday through Friday, are correlated with higher child BMIs. Perhaps it is harder for mothers who work often or irregularly to find time or energy to engage in physical activity with their children. Their schedules may also prevent them from being present during their children’s meal times. As a result, children may not be eating as healthy or balanced a meal as they would otherwise. Meal choices are very important and children don't always make the healthiest decisions. That is not to say that mothers cannot instill healthy eating and exercise habits that persist even when the mother is elsewhere.
