Newton described force as the ability to cause a mass to accelerate. His three laws can be summarized as follows:
First law: If there is no net force on an object, then its velocity is constant. The object is either at rest (if its velocity is equal to zero), or it moves with constant speed in a single direction.
Second law: The rate of change of linear momentum P of an object is equal to the net force Fnet, i.e., dP/dt = Fnet.
Third law: When a first body exerts a force F1 on a second body, the second body simultaneously exerts a force F2 = âˆ’F1 on the first body. This means that F1 and F2 are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.
Newton's Laws of Motion are valid only in an inertial frame of reference
