reduced tolerances or cover less than all ranges and parameters. This approach is often used when the
instrument does not meet full calibration tolerances on certain ranges or parameters, but can still meet
user requirements. On the other hand, the special calibration may be for higher accuracy than usual on a
short-term basis upon your specific request.
