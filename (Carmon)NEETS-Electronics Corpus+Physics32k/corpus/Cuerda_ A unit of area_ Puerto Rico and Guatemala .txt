In Puerto Rico, a cuerda is a traditional unit of land area nearly equivalent to 3,930 square meters, or 4,700 square yards, 0.971 acre, or 0.393 hectare (ha). The precise conversion is 1 cuerda = 3,930.395625 m2. The term "Spanish acre" instead has been used sometimes by mainlanders. A cuerda and an acre have often been treated as equal because they are nearly the same size.
According to Carlos Menocal Villagran, in Guatemala the term cuerda refers to a unit of area and can have various meanings. Cuerda can refer to areas that are 50 x 50, 40 x 40, 30 x 30, 25 x 25 or 20 x 20 varas (i.e. 2500, 1600, 900, 625, or 400 square varas). In addition, some sources describe a cuerda as 32 x 32 varas. In Guatemala, the linear vara is equivalent to 0.8421 meters. (The length of a vara varies slightly among different Latin American countries.) Thus,
One cuerda of 50 x 50 varas = 1,746.84 square meters
One cuerda of 40 x 40 varas = 1,117.98 square meters
One cuerda of 30 x 30 varas = 628.87 square meters
One cuerda of 25 x 25 varas = 436.71 square meters
One cuerda of 20 x 20 varas = 279.50 square meters
