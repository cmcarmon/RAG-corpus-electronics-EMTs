In the previous sections, internal stability of time-invariant systems was examined, i.e., the stability of the state
was investigated. In this section the external stability of systems is discussed; this is usually called the BIBO
(bounded-input, bounded-output) stability. Here we drop the simplifying assumption of the previous section
that the system is time-invariant: we will examine time-variant systems.
