we can write PTotal(df ) = 4kTE (R1 + R2 )df. TE is called the effective noise temperature [see Gardner, 1990, p. 289;
or Peebles, 1987, p. 228]. An antenna receives noise from various sources of electromagnetic radiation, such as
radio  transmissions  and  harmonics,  switching  equipment  (such  as  computers,  electrical  motor  controllers),
thermal (blackbody) radiation of the atmosphere and other matter, solar radiation, stellar radiation, and galaxial
radiation (the ambient noise of the universe). To account for noise at the antenna output, we model the noise
with  an  equivalent  thermal  noise  using  an  effective  noise  temperature TE .  The  incremental  available  power
(output) over an incremental frequency band df is PYY (df ) = kTE df, from Eq. (73.27). TE  is often called antenna
temperature, denoted by TA . Although it varies with the frequency band, it is usually virtually constant over a
small bandwidth.
