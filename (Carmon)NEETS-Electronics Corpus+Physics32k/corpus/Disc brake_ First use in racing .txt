The first use of disc brakes in racing was in 1951, one of the BRM Type 15s using a Girling-produced set, a first for a Formula One car. Reliable caliper-type disc brakes later appeared in 1953 on the Jaguar C-Type racing car. These brakes helped the company to win the 1953 24 Hours of Le Mans, developed in the UK by Dunlop. That same year, the aluminum bodied Austin-Healey 100S, of which 50 were made, was the first car sold to the public to have disc brakes, fitted to all 4 wheels.
