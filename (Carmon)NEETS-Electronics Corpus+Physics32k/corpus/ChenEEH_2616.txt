In principle, resonance isolators can be designed for
any transmission line in which circularly polarized electro-
magnetic waves exist. Most often, isolators are realized in
rectangular waveguides. Figure 7.43 shows two typical wave-
guide isolators in the E-plane and H-plane. The E-plane
geometry has the advantages of requiring a lower biasing
Ô¨Åeld to drive the isolator, while its H-plane counterpart is
normally used for high-power applications because of easy
heat dissipation.
