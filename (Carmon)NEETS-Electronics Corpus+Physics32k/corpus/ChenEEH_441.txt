deviations from the ideal I–V behavior of equation 5.8 occur
because of conductivity modulation, resulting in m ¼ 2, as
well as because of series resistances (see later sections in this
chapter). At certain reverse bias V < 0, the current starts to
increase again due to avalanche breakdown at lower doping
concentrations or tunneling at higher doping concentrations
(e.g., Zener diodes) (Sze, 1981).
