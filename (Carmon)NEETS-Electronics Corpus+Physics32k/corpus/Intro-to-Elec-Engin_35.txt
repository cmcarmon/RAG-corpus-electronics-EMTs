To answer the Ô¨Årst question in a simple way, electrical engineering deals mainly with
information systems and with power and energy systems. In the former, electrical means are
used to transmit, store, and process information; while in the latter, bulk energy is transmitted
from one place to another and power is converted from one form to another.
