The key concepts in UNIX include the process, the memory
mode, the ﬁle system, and I/O. Processes may fork off sub-
processes, leading to a tree of processes. The memory model
consists of a text, data, and stack segment for each process. The
ﬁle system supports regular ﬁles, directories, and two kinds of
special ﬁles. Directories may contain subdirectories, leading to
a hierarchical ﬁle system. I/O is done using character and block
special ﬁles that are integrated into the ﬁle system. Access to
UNIX services is achieved via system calls.
