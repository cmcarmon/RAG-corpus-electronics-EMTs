Each process is one of the following:
isothermal (at constant temperature, maintained with heat added or removed from a heat source or sink)
isobaric (at constant pressure)
isometric/isochoric (at constant volume), also referred to as iso-volumetric
adiabatic (no heat is added or removed from the system during adiabatic process)
isentropic (reversible adiabatic process, no heat is added or removed during isentropic process)
