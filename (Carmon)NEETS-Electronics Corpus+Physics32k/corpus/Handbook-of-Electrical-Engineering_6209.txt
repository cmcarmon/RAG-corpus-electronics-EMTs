Propagation
One of the major factors in the determination of ﬁeld strength is the propagation characteristic that is described
by the change in electric ﬁeld intensity with an increase in distance from the broadcast station antenna. This
variation depends on a number of factors including frequency, distance, surface dielectric constant, surface loss
tangent, polarization, local topography, and time of day. Generally speaking, groundwave propagation occurs
at shorter ranges both during day and night periods. Skywave propagation permits longer ranges and occurs
during night periods, and thus some stations must either reduce power or cease to operate at night to avoid
causing interference. Propagation curves in the broadcast industry are frequently referred to a reference level
of  100 mV/m  at  1 km;  however,  a  more  general  expression  of  groundwave  propagation  may  be  obtained  by
using the Bremmer series [Bremmer, 1949]. A typical groundwave propagation curve for electric ﬁeld strength
as  a  function  of  distance  is  shown  in  Fig. 69.9  for  an  operating  frequency  of  770–810 kHz.  The  ground
conductivity varies from 0.1 to 5000 mS/m, and the ground relative dielectric constant is 15.
