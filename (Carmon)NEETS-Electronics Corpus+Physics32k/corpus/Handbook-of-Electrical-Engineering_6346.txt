For the demonstrations, VHF and UHF transmission frequencies between 200 and 900 MHz were used with
satisfactory  results.  Because  most  VHF  and  UHF  frequency  bands  suitable  for  DAB  are  already  in  use  (or
reserved for high-deÔ¨Ånition television and other new services), an additional Canadian study in 1991 evaluated
frequencies near 1500 MHz (L-band) for use as a potential worldwide DAB allocation. This study concluded
that L-band frequencies would support a DAB system such as Eureka-147, while continuing to meet the overall
system design goals.
