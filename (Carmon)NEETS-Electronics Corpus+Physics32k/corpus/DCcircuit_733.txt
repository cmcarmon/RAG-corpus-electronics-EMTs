The actual movement mechanism of a clamp-on ammeter is much the same as for an iron-
vane instrument, except that there is no internal wire coil to generate the magnetic ﬁeld. More
modern designs of clamp-on ammeters utilize a small magnetic ﬁeld detector device called
a Hall-effect sensor to accurately determine ﬁeld strength. Some clamp-on meters contain
electronic ampliﬁer circuitry to generate a small voltage proportional to the current in the
