Theorem 3.2. Let D be the determinant of the node admittance matrix Yn of a passive network N with n + 1
nodes and without mutual inductances. Also let the reference node be denoted by 1¢. Then the ( j,j)-cofactor
D jj of D is equal to the sum of all the 2-tree-admittance products T2 j,1¢(y) of N, each of which contains node j
in one part and node 1¢ as the reference node) and without mutual inductances is given by
