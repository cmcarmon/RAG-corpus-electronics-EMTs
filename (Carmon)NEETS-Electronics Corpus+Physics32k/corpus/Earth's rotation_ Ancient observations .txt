There are preserved observations of solar and lunar eclipses from Babylonian astronomy and Chinese astronomy beginning from the 8th century BCE. These observations, as well as further astronomical historical records from astronomy in the medieval Islamic world and elsewhere, can be used to determine the actual changes in the rotation of the Earth over the last 27 centuries: The calculation to describe the place and time of eclipse is dependent on the rotation of the Earth. The ancient observations are consistent with the Earth having rotated a significant fraction of a total turn than would result from today's value of the speed of rotation would indicate: The Earth was turning ever faster throughout the past. The cumulative effect of the faster turn, of a magnitude of milliseconds per day per century, 36,525 days per century, shows up in a magnitude of hours and thousands of kilometers in observations. Scholars have combed the ancient records and calculated by modern models the magnitude of the long term historical slowing down of the Earth's rotation.
