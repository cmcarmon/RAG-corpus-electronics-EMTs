For most voice communication, very low speech volumes
predominate; about 50% of the time, the voltage characteriz-
ing detected speech energy is less than 1/4 of the root-mean-
square (rms) value. Large amplitude values are relatively rare;
only 15% of the time does the voltage exceed the rms value.
The quantization noise depends on the step size. When the
steps are uniform in size, the quantization is called the uniform
quantization. Such a system would be wasteful for speech
signals; many of the quantizing steps would rarely be used. In
a system that uses equally spaced quantization levels, the
quantization noise is same for all signal magnitudes. Thus,
with uniform quantization, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
is worse for low-level signals than for high-level signals. Non-
uniform quantization can provide Ô¨Åne quantization of the
weak signals and coarse quantization of the strong signals.
Thus, in the case of nonuniform quantization, quantization
noise can be made proportional to signal size. Improving the
overall SNR by reducing the noise for predominant weak
signals, at the expense of an increase in noise, can be done for
rarely occurring signals. The nonuniform quantization can
be used to make the SNR a constant for all signals within the
input range. For voice, the signal dynamic range is 40 dB.
