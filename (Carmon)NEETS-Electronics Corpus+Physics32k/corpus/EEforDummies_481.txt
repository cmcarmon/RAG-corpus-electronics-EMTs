When the DC voltage is first switched on, the current that starts to flow 
induces a magnetic field around the coils of the inductor. As the current 
increases (which it’s trying to do instantaneously), the strength of the mag-
netic field increases proportionally. Because the magnetic field is changing, 
it induces a back voltage that in turn induces a current in the coiled wire in 
the opposite direction to that of the current already flowing from the voltage 
source. The inductor seems to be trying to prevent the source current from 
changing too quickly; the effect is that the current doesn’t increase instanta-
neously. This is why inductors are said to oppose changes in current.
