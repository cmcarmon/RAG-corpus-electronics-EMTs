Optical telemeters use light transmitted through space or through optical Ô¨Åbers, the light being modulated
by the measurement signal. The modulation may be produced either electrically or mechanically. Electrically,
light-emitting diodes, lasers, or electroluminescent material are used to convert the electricity to light. The light
may  then  be  modulated  with  the  measurement  information  by  modulating  the  electricity  that  produces  the
light or it may be polarized and rotated by Kerr or Pockels cells, absorbed by electrically activated chromofors,
or converted to another wavelength by electrically controlled nonlinear elements, all of which are activated by
the modulating signal.
