p to this time, digital data storage was
generally done by encoding binary data
on  rotating  magnetic  drums  or  other
means where data had to be stored and retrieved
sequentially.  This  patent  describes  a  system
whereby data could be stored and retrieved ran-
domly  by  a  simple  addressing  scheme.  It  used
tiny doughnut-shaped ferromagnetic cores with
windings to magnetically polarize the material
in  one  direction  or  the  other.  This  was  about
one  hundred  times  faster  than  rotating  drums
and  took  up  perhaps  2%  of  the  volume.  A
4-Kbyte  core  memory  module  would  take  up
about 60 cubic inches and could access data in
less than one millisecond. Random access mem-
ory (RAM) was born. Core memory (as it has
become  known)  was  non-volatile;  that  is,  the
information would not be lost when power was
cut. Modern non-volatile “ﬂash” memory is yet
again  thousands  of  times  faster  and  achieves
data density of over 100,000 times greater than
the  breakthrough  magnetic  core  memory
described  by  Forrester.  (Copyright  ©  1995,
