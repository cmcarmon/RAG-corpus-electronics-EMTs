A supergun is an extraordinarily large artillery piece. This size may be due to a large bore, barrel length, or a combination of the two. While early examples tended to have a fairly short range, more recent examples have sometimes had an extremely high muzzle velocity, resulting in a very long range.
Depending on the design, they may be used to destroy heavy fortifications or bombard an enemy from extremely long range.
