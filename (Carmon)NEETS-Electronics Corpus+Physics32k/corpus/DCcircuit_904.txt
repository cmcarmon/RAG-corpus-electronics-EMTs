As usual, the precision voltage supply would be adjusted by the technician until the null
detector registered zero, then the voltmeter connected in parallel with the supply would be
viewed to obtain a voltage reading. With the detector ”nulled” (registering exactly zero), there
should be zero current in the pH electrode circuit, and therefore no voltage dropped across the
resistances of either electrode, giving the real electrode voltage at the voltmeter terminals.
