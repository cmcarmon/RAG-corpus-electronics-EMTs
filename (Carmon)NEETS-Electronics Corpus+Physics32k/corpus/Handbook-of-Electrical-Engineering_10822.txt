Integrated Circuits
The complex process of manufacturing semiconductor integrated circuits (IC) often consists of over a hundred
steps during which many copies of an individual IC are formed on a single wafer. Each of the major process
steps used in IC manufacturing involves some combination of energy use, material consumption, and material
waste. Water usage is high due to the many cleaning and rinsing process steps. Absent process innovation, this
trend will continue as wafer sizes increase, driving up the cost of water and waste water fees, and increasing
mandated water conservation.
