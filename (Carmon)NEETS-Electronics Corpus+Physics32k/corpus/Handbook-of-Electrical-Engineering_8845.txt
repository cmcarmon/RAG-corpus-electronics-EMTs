Strictness: Most  carrier  sets  are  assumed  to  contain  a  distinguished  value:  error.  Error  is  not  a  proper
computational object: a function is considered to compute error if it does not return to the point of its
invocation  due  to  some  error  condition.  Functions  are  called  strict  if  they  compute  the  value  error
whenever one or more of their arguments have the value error.
