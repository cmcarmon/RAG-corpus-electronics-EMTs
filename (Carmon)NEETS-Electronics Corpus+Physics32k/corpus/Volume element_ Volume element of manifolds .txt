On an oriented Riemannian manifold of dimension n, the volume element is a volume form equal to the Hodge dual of the unit constant function,



f
(
x
)
=
1


{\displaystyle f(x)=1}
:




ω
=

1


{\displaystyle \omega =\star 1}
.
Equivalently, the volume element is precisely the Levi-Civita tensor



ϵ


{\displaystyle \epsilon }
. In coordinates,

{\displaystyle \det g}
is the determinant of the metric tensor g written in the coordinate system.
