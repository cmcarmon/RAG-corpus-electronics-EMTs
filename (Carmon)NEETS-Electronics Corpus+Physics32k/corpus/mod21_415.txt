POWER METERS that are designed to measure af power can be separated into two distinct groups. 
Power meters that are designed for measuring sine waves are basically electronic voltmeters calibrated in 
dB or dBm. VU METERS are designed to measure the average value of complex waveforms, such as a 
voice.
