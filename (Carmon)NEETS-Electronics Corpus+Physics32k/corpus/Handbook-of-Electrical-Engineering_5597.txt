where m is a constant depending upon the line impedances and I0 is the zero sequence current in the trans-
mission  line.  A  full  complement  of  relays  consists  of  three  phase  distance  relays  and  three  ground  distance
relays. As  explained  before,  the  phase  relays  are  energized  by  the  delta  quantities,  while  the  ground  distance
relays are energized by each of the phase voltages and the corresponding compensated phase currents. In many
instances, ground distance protection is not preferred, and the time overcurrent relays may be used for ground
fault protection.
