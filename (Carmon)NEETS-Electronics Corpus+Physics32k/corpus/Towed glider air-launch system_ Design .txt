The system comprises three large components: a tow plane, a glider, and a rocket. The tow plane, a conventional small aircraft, carries the glider up to about 40,000 feet (12,000 m) before releasing the towline and flying back. The glider, carrying its own hybrid or solid rocket motor, will ignite its engine to glide higher than the tow plane's maximum altitude. Following burnout of its rocket, the glider will jettison the third (exclusively rocket powered) stage of the system. This rocket stage will then carry its satellite payload into low Earth orbit.
NASA's concept aims to create a platform that can launch 15 times the mass of the glider, compared to 0.7 times for other air-launch reusable spaceflight systems. According to Aero News, the advantage of the system is that gliders don't carry engines with them and have longer, lighter wings, resulting in lower total mass. NASA discussed the advantages of this system in a report:

The TGALS demonstration's goal is to provide proof-of-concept of a towed, airborne launch platform. Distinct advantages are believed possible in cost, logistic efficiency, and performance when utilizing a towed, high lift-to-drag launch platform as opposed to utilizing a traditional powered 'mothership' launch platform. The project goal is to examine the performance advantage, as well as the operational aspects, of a towed, airborne launch system.

According to Gerrard Budd, the development manager of NASA Armstrong Center's air launch program, "[NASA] thinks that [the glider] is the optimization for air launch", comparing the design of the system to other air launch systems in development.
