A power diode requires a ﬁnite time to switch from the
blocking state (reverse bias) to the on-state (forward bias)
and vice versa. This is because of the ﬁnite time required for
establishment and removal of steady-state carrier distribution
in the drift region. During turn-on, the terminal voltage, VA,
ﬁrst rises to a value VFP that is much higher than the static
forward drop before decaying to the steady-state value, VF ,
determined by the static characteristics. This process is called
forward recovery, and VFP is known as the forward recovery
voltage. When the diode is turned off, the current changes at a
rate dI/dt determined by the external circuit conditions. The
diode current displays a negative peak before decaying to zero.
Correspondingly, device voltage rises to the off-state voltage,
VR. The process of negative current ﬂow during device turn-off
is referred to as the reverse recovery process. The current, Irr ,
is the reverse recovery current peak, and trr
is the reverse
recovery time. These quantities are expressed as:
