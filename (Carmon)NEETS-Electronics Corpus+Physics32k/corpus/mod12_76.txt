In conclusion, when dc or sine-wave voltages are applied to a linear impedance, the current through 
the impedance will vary directly with a change in the voltage. The device could be a resistor, an air-core 
inductor, a capacitor, or any other linear device. In other words, if a sine-wave generator output is applied 
to a combination of linear impedances, the resultant current will be a sine wave which is directly 
proportional to the change in voltage of the generator. The linear impedances do not alter the waveform of 
the sine wave. The amplitude of the voltage developed across each linear component may vary, or the 
phase of the wave may shift, but the shape of the wave will remain the same.
