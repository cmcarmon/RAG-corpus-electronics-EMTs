Planarity: Lying in the same plane. A plane is deﬁned by the exit of the leads from the body of the IC (arrow
#1 above). A second plane is deﬁned as the average of the lowest point all leads are below the ﬁrst plane
(arrow #2 above). Non-planarity is the maximum variation in mils or mm of any lead of an SMD from
the lowest point plane.
