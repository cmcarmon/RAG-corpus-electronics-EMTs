In an ideal transformer, the core is also infinitely permeable, that is, µ = ∞. For
a single-coil inductor carrying a finite flux (t) = λ(t)/N, Equation 9.22 shows
that the total ampere-turns Ni(t) flowing around the core through the coil must
vanish as µ becomes infinite. In an ideal transformer, the total ampere turns
must similarly vanish, and so
