use, and manipulate many other symbols to represent facts in the world in which we live. We are 
fortunate that early computer experts soon realized the need to manipulate nonnumerical symbols as well. 
Manipulating these symbols is possible if an identifying code or coded number is assigned to the symbol 
to be stored and processed. Thus, the letters in a name such as ALBERT or CAROL can be represented 
by different codes, as can all special characters, such as #, (,), &, $, @, and yes, even the comma. The 
data to be represented is called source data.
