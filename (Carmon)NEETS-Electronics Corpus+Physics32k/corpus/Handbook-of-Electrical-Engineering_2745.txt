D. Floorplanning: Next, the individual circuit blocks must be compactly arranged to ﬁt within the minimum
area. Floorplanning establishes this organization, as illustrated in Fig. 25.25(c). At this stage, routing of
interconnections among blocks has not been performed, perhaps requiring modiﬁcations to the ﬂoor
plan after routing. During ﬂoor planning, the design of a logic function in terms of a block function
can be modiﬁed to achieve shapes which better match the available IC area. For example, the block E(b)
in Fig. 25.25(b) has been redesigned to provide a different geometric shape for block E(f) in the ﬂoor
plan in Fig. 25.25(c).
