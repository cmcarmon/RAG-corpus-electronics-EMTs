To acquire and track a satellite in space, the earth terminal antennas must be provided with very 
accurate pointing information. Antenna pointing information is based upon the orbital prediction of the 
satellite. This information is derived from an EPHEMERIS table. This table provides the coordinates of a 
satellite or a celestial body at specific times during a given period. After you know the ephemeris data of 
a satellite, you can predict for any given location the apparent track of the satellite as viewed from that 
location.
