Most electronic circuits include both AC and DC 
voltages. This results in an AC signal superimposed 
on a DC signal. If the DC signal is used to operate  
equipment, it is advantageous to remove the AC  signals. 
An RC low-pass filter can be used for this  purpose. 
A  decoupling  network  (Figure  24-6)  allows 
the DC signal to pass while attenuating or eliminating 
the AC signal. The AC signal may be in the form of os-
cillations, noises, or transient spikes. By adjusting the 
cutoff frequency, most of the AC signal can be filtered 
out, leaving only the DC voltage across the capacitor.
