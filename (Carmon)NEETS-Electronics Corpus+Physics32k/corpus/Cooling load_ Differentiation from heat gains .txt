The cooling load of a building should not be confused with its heat gains. Heat gains refer to the rate at which heat is transferred into or generated inside a building. Just like cooling loads, heat gains can be separated into sensible and latent heat gains that can occur through conduction, convection, and radiation. Thermophysical properties of walls, floors, ceilings, and windows, lighting power density (LPD), plug load density, occupant density, and equipment efficiency play an important role in determining the magnitude of heat gains in a building. ASHRAE handbook of fundamentals refers to the following six modes of entry for heat gains:
Solar radiation through transparent surfaces
Heat conduction through exterior walls and roofs
Heat conduction through ceilings, floors, and interior partitions
Heat generated in the space by occupants, lights, and appliances
Energy transfer through direct-with-space ventilation and infiltration of outdoor air
Miscellaneous heats gains
Furthermore, heat extraction rate is the rate at which heat is actually being removed from the space by the cooling equipment. Heat gains, heat extraction rate, and cooling loads values are often not equal due to thermal inertia effects. Heat is stored in the mass of the building and furnishings delaying the time at which it can become a heat gain and be extracted by the cooling equipment to maintain the desired indoor conditions. Another reason is that the inability of the cooling system to keep dry bulb temperature and humidity constant.
