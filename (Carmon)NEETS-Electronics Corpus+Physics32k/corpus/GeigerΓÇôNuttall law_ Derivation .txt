A simple way to derive this law is to consider an alpha particle in the atomic nucleus as a particle in a box. The particle is in a bound state because of the presence of the strong interaction potential. It will constantly bounce from one side to the other, and due to the possibility of quantum tunneling by the wave through the potential barrier, each time it bounces, there will be a small likelihood for it to escape.
A knowledge of this quantum mechanical effect enables one to obtain this law, including coefficients, via direct calculation.[2] This calculation was first performed by physicist George Gamow in 1928.
