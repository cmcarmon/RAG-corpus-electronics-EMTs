In the ﬁrst-order function, T1, a and b may be positive, negative,
or zero, but s must be positive. Similarly, in the second-order
function, the coefﬁcients k1 can be positive, negative, or zero,
depending on where T2 is to have transmission zeros. For
example, T2 can realize a low-pass (k2 ¼ k1 ¼ 0), a high-pass
(k1 ¼ k0 ¼ 0), a band-pass (k2 ¼ k0 ¼ 0), a band-rejection or
