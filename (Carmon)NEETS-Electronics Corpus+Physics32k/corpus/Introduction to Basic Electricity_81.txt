For	the	transition	of	the	Star-Delta	Transformation	into	the	Delta-Star
Transformation,	a	formula	should	be	followed;	this	is	meant	to	ensure	that	the
transformation,	along	with	the	calculations	for	the	total	resistance	in	all	3	circuits,
is	successful.	Initially,	the	goal	is	to	compare	the	amount	of	power	in	an	individual
network.	Once	the	power	in	network	1	has	been	acknowledged,	proceed	to
identifying	the	weight	that	one	network	holds	in	the	entire	formation;	one	way	of
determining	this	is	to	disconnect	that	entire	network	and	observe	the	operations	of
a	circuit.
The	formula:
**representations:														Î”R	=														total	resistance	of	the
transformation
