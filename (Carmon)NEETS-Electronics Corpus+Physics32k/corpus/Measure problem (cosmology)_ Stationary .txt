The stationary measure proceeds from the observation that different processes achieve stationarity of

at different times. Thus, rather than comparing processes at a given time since the beginning, the stationary measure compares them in terms of time since each process individually become stationary. For instance, different regions of the universe can be compared based on time since star formation began.
Andrei Linde and coauthors have suggested that the stationary measure avoids both the youngness paradox and Boltzmann brains. However, the stationary measure predicts extreme (either very large or very small) values of the primordial density contrast
