  and
packet  switching  are  transmission  technologies  while  message  switching  is  a  service  technology.  In  circuit
switching, a call connection between two terminating equipments corresponds to the allocation of a prescribed
set of physical facilities that provide a transmission path of a certain bandwidth or transmission capacity. These
facilities  are  dedicated  to  the  users  for  the  duration  of  the  call.  The  primary  performance  issues,  other  than
those related to quality of transmission, are related to whether or not a transmission path is available at call
set-up time and how calls are handled if facilities are not available.
