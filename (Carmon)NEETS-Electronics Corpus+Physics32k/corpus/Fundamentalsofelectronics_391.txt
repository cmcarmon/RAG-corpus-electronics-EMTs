Consider this mathematical question intuitively: Can a discontinuous function, like the square wave, be
expressed as a sum, even an inﬁnite one, of continuous signals? One should at least be suspicious, and in fact,
it can’t be thus expressed. The extraneous peaks in the square wave’s Fourier series never disappear; they
are termed Gibbs’ phenomenon after the American physicist Josiah Willard Gibbs. They occur whenever
the signal is discontinuous, and will always be present whenever the signal has jumps. This issue brought
