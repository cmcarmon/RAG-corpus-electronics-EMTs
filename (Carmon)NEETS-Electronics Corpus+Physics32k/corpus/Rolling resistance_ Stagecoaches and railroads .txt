According to Dupuit (1837), rolling resistance (of wheeled carriages with wooden wheels with iron tires) is approximately inversely proportional to the square root of wheel diameter. This rule has been experimentally verified for cast iron wheels (8" - 24" diameter) on steel rail and for 19th century carriage wheels. But there are other tests on carriage wheels that do not agree. Theory of a cylinder rolling on an elastic roadway also gives this same rule These contradict earlier (1785) tests by Coulomb of rolling wooden cylinders where Coulomb reported that rolling resistance was inversely proportional to the diameter of the wheel (known as "Coulomb's law"). This disputed (or wrongly applied) -"Coulomb's law" is still found in handbooks, however.
