The phasor diagram may be drawn in a number of ways, such as in a polar (or ray) form,
with all phasors originating at the origin, or in a polygonal form, with one phasor located at the
end of another, or in a combination of these, depending on the convenience and the point to be
made. Such diagrams provide geometrical insight into the voltage and current relationships in a
network. They are particularly helpful in visualizing steady-state phenomena in the analysis of
networks with sinusoidal signals.
