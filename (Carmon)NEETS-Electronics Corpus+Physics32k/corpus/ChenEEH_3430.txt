Speed
The speed of operation is the most critical protective relay
operating criterion. The relays have to be fast enough to allow
clearing of a fault in the minimum time needed to ensure
reliable and safe power system operation. The minimum oper-
ating time of a relay is achieved when the relay operates
without any intentional time delay settings. Such an example
is the time of operation of a distance relay in a direct (instan-
taneous) trip in Zone 1. The operating time may vary from the
theoretical minimum possible to the time that a practical
solution of a relaying algorithm may take to produce a deci-
sion. The operating time is dependent on the algorithm and
technology used to implement the relay design. Because the
relays respond to the fault transients, the relay operating time
