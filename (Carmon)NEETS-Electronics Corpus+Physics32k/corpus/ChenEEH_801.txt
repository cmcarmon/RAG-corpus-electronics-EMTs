The IEEE Standard 1076 of VHDL has been considerably
extended to cope with modeling requirements in the time-
continuous domain and especially with mixed-signal, multi-
nature systems (i.e., event-discrete and time-continuous be-
haviors for heterogeneous models). This objective is depicted
in Figure 3.4.
