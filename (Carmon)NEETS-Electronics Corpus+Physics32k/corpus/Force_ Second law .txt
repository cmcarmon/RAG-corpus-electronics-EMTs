A modern statement of Newton's Second Law is a vector equation:







F
→



=




d




p
→






d

t



,


{\displaystyle {\vec {F}}={\frac {\mathrm {d} {\vec {p}}}{\mathrm {d} t}},}

where






p
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {p}}}
is the momentum of the system, and






F
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {F}}}
is the net (vector sum) force. If a body is in equilibrium, there is zero net force by definition (balanced forces may be present nevertheless). In contrast, the second law states that if there is an unbalanced force acting on an object it will result in the object's momentum changing over time.
By the definition of momentum,







F

=




d




p

(

v

)




d

t



,


{\displaystyle {\vec {F}}={\frac {\mathrm {d} {\vec {p}}}{\mathrm {d} t}}={\frac {\mathrm {d} \left(m{\vec {v}}\right)}{\mathrm {d} t}},}

where m is the mass and






v
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {v}}}
is the velocity.
If Newton's second law is applied to a system of constant mass, m may be moved outside the derivative operator. The equation then becomes







F
→



=
m




d




v
→






d

t



.


{\displaystyle {\vec {F}}=m{\frac {\mathrm {d} {\vec {v}}}{\mathrm {d} t}}.}

By substituting the definition of acceleration, the algebraic version of Newton's Second Law is derived:







F
→



=
m



a
→



.


{\displaystyle {\vec {F}}=m{\vec {a}}.}

Newton never explicitly stated the formula in the reduced form above.
Newton's Second Law asserts the direct proportionality of acceleration to force and the inverse proportionality of acceleration to mass. Accelerations can be defined through kinematic measurements. However, while kinematics are well-described through reference frame analysis in advanced physics, there are still deep questions that remain as to what is the proper definition of mass. General relativity offers an equivalence between space-time and mass, but lacking a coherent theory of quantum gravity, it is unclear as to how or whether this connection is relevant on microscales. With some justification, Newton's second law can be taken as a quantitative definition of mass by writing the law as an equality; the relative units of force and mass then are fixed.
The use of Newton's Second Law as a definition of force has been disparaged in some of the more rigorous textbooks, because it is essentially a mathematical truism. Notable physicists, philosophers and mathematicians who have sought a more explicit definition of the concept of force include Ernst Mach and Walter Noll.
Newton's Second Law can be used to measure the strength of forces. For instance, knowledge of the masses of planets along with the accelerations of their orbits allows scientists to calculate the gravitational forces on planets.
