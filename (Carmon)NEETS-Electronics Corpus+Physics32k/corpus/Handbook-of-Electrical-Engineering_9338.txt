Top-down  testing  begins  with  the  modules  that  are  not  used  by  any  other  module.  Since  the  supporting
modules have not been tested yet (or do not even exist yet), simple stand-in programs must be written that
simulate the actual programs. This can be done by replacing the computation of the actual program with the
programmer, who enters the required results from the keyboard in response to the parameter values displayed
on the screen. This method is nontrivial, especially if the supporting program deals with complex objects.
