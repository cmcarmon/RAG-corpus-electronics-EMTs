Starting with a real-world problem to be solved, a ﬁrst
conceptual model is derived that addresses the relevant prop-
erties of the problem. In general, this model is denoted in a
mathematical way and has to be represented such that an
execution becomes possible. At this point, the question of
description languages gains interest. After some reﬁnement
steps at different abstraction and accuracy levels, the model is
to be validated in the envisaged context, serving as a virtual
prototype of the system to be produced.
