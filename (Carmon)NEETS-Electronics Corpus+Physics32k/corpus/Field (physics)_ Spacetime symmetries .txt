Fields are often classified by their behaviour under transformations of spacetime. The terms used in this classification are:
scalar fields (such as temperature) whose values are given by a single variable at each point of space. This value does not change under transformations of space.
vector fields (such as the magnitude and direction of the force at each point in a magnetic field) which are specified by attaching a vector to each point of space. The components of this vector transform between themselves contravariantly under rotations in space. Similarly, a dual (or co-) vector field attaches a dual vector to each point of space, and the components of each dual vector transform covariantly.
tensor fields, (such as the stress tensor of a crystal) specified by a tensor at each point of space. Under rotations in space, the components of the tensor transform in a more general way which depends on the number of covariant indices and contravariant indices.
spinor fields (such as the Dirac spinor) arise in quantum field theory to describe particles with spin which transform like vectors except for the one of their component; in other words, when one rotates a vector field 360 degrees around a specific axis, the vector field turns to itself; however, spinors would turn to their negatives in the same case.
