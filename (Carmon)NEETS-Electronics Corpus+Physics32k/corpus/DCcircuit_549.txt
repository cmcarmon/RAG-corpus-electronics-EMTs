We should already be familiar with the general principle for series circuits stating that
individual voltage drops add up to the total applied voltage, but measuring voltage drops in
this manner and paying attention to the polarity (mathematical sign) of the readings reveals
another facet of this principle: that the voltages measured as such all add up to zero:
