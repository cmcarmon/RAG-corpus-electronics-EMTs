If a point R is selected as the point of application of the resultant force F of a system of n forces Fi then the associated torque T is determined from the formulas

{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =\sum _{i=1}^{n}\mathbf {F} _{i},}

and

.


{\displaystyle \mathbf {T} =\sum _{i=1}^{n}(\mathbf {R} _{i}-\mathbf {R} )\times \mathbf {F} _{i}.}

It is useful to note that the point of application R of the resultant force may be anywhere along the line of action of F without changing the value of the associated torque. To see this add the vector kF to the point of application R in the calculation of the associated torque,

{\displaystyle \mathbf {T} =\sum _{i=1}^{n}(\mathbf {R} _{i}-(\mathbf {R} +k\mathbf {F} ))\times \mathbf {F} _{i}.}

The right side of this equation can be separated into the original;formula for T plus the additional term including kF,

because the second term is zero. To see this notice that F is the sum of the vectors Fi which yields

{\displaystyle \sum _{i=1}^{n}k\mathbf {F} \times \mathbf {F} _{i}=k\mathbf {F} \times (\sum _{i=1}^{n}\mathbf {F} _{i})=0,}

thus the value of the associated torque is unchanged.
