Figure 2-22 shows a power distribution system using circuit breakers for protection. Circuit breaker
1 (CB1) has the entire current for all seven loads through it. CB2 feeds loads 1, 2, 3, and 4 (through CB4,
CB5, CB6, and CB7), and CB3 feeds loads 5, 6, and 7 (through CB8, CB9, and CB10). If all the circuit
breakers were rated with the same time delay, an overload on load 5 could cause CB1, CB3, and CB8 to
trip. This would remove power from all seven loads, even though load 5 was the only circuit with an
overload.
