Chebyshev's Lambda Mechanism
Watt's linkage, a similar straight-line mechanism with the direction of one of the arms reversed.
Straight line mechanism
Scott Russell linkage
Hoeckens linkage (4-bar linkage that converts rotational motion to approximate straight-line motion)
Peaucellierâ€“Lipkin linkage ( an 8-bar linkage that gives perfect linear motion)
Four-bar linkage
