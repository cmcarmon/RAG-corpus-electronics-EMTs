Figure 6.20: To correct errors that occur in the digital channel, a channel coder and decoder are added
to the communication system. Properly designed channel coding can greatly reduce the probability (from
the uncoded value of pe) that a data bit b (n) is received incorrectly even when the probability of c (l)
be received in error remains pe or becomes larger. This system forms the Fundamental Model of Digital
Communication.
