Some linear potentiometers are actuated by straight-line motion of a lever or slide button.
Others, like the one depicted in the previous illustration, are actuated by a turn-screw for ﬁne
adjustment ability. The latter units are sometimes referred to as trimpots, because they work
well for applications requiring a variable resistance to be ”trimmed” to some precise value.
It should be noted that not all linear potentiometers have the same terminal assignments as
shown in this illustration. With some, the wiper terminal is in the middle, between the two
end terminals.
