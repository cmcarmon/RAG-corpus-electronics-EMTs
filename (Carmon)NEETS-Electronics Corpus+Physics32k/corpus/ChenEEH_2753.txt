We now consider the possibility of ~vvp exceeding c in this
situation. Nyquist theory states that any physical or numerical
process that obtains samples of a time waveform every Dt
seconds can reproduce the original waveform without aliasing
for spectral content up to fmax Â¼ 1=(2Dt). In the present case,
the corresponding minimum free space wavelength that can be
sampled without aliasing is therefore:
