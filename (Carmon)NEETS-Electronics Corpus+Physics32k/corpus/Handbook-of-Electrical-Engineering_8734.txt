HLLs and Paradigms
A programming paradigm is a way of viewing the world, e.g., an idealized model. HLLs depend on paradigms
to guide their design and use. In fact, one might call HLL designers paradigm engineers because a good HLL
starts with a strong model. Without such a model, the abstraction of a HLL is meaningless. In this section we
examine the variety of paradigms embodied in a number of HLLs.
