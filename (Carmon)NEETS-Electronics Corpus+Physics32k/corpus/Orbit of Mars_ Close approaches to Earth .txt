Mars comes closer to Earth than any other planet save Venus at its nearestâ€”56 versus 40 million km. The distances have been declining over the years, and in 2003 the minimum distance was 55.76 Gm, nearer than any such encounter in almost 60,000 years (57617 BC). This modern record will be beaten in 2287, and the record before 3000 will be set in 2729 at 55.65. By 4000, the record will stand at 55.44. The distances will continue to decrease for about 24,000 years.
