To complete your understanding of AM modulation, we are now going to analyze the operation of a 
typical plate modulator. Detailed circuit descriptions will be used to give you an understanding of a basic 
AM plate modulator. In addition, we will cover basic circuit descriptions for cathode and grid electron-
tube modulators and for base, emitter, and collector transistor modulators in this chapter.
