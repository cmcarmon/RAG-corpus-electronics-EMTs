By time one (T1), input signal number one has reached +1 volt and input signal number two has
reached - 1 volt. This is an overall increase in base-to-emitter bias of 2 volts. Since the gain of the circuit
is - 10, the output signal has decreased by 20 volts. As you can see, the output signal has been determined
by the difference between the two input signals. In fact, the base-to-emitter bias can be found by
subtracting the value of input signal number two from the value of input signal number one.
