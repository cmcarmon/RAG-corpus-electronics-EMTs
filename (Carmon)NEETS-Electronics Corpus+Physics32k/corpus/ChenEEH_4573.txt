the general nonlinear system. Through discrete-time Lyapu-
nov stability theory, the necessary and sufﬁcient conditions to
guarantee the system online stability and performance under
failures were derived, and a systematic procedure and tech-
nique for proper fault accommodation under unanticipated
failures were developed. The approach is to combine the con-
trol technique derived from discrete-time Lyapunov stability
theory with the modern intelligent technique that is capable of
self-optimization and online adaptation for real-time failure
estimation. A more complete architecture of fault diagnosis
and accommodation has also been presented by incorporating
the developed intelligent fault-tolerant control technique with
a cost-effective fault detection scheme and a multiple model-
based failure diagnosis process to efﬁciently handle the false
alarms, to accommodate the anticipated failures, and to reduce
the unnecessary control effort and computational complexity
in online situations.
