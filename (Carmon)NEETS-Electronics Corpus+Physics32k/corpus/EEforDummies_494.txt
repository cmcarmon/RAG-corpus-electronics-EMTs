Because inductors pass DC and block more and more AC as frequency 
increases, they are natural low‐pass filters. In Chapter 7, you find out that 
capacitors block DC signals and allow AC signals to pass, so (as you might 
guess) they are natural high‐pass filters. In electronic filter design — which is 
a complex topic beyond the scope of this book — components are carefully 
selected to precisely control which frequencies are allowed to pass through 
to the output.
