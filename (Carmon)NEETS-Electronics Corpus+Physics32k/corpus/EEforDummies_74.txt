Because you can’t see gobs of flowing electrons, try thinking about water to 
help make sense out of harnessing electrical energy. A single drop of water 
can’t do much on its own, but get a whole group of water drops to work in 
unison, funnel them through a conduit, direct the flow of water toward an 
object (for example, a waterwheel), and you can put the resulting energy to 
good use. Just as millions of drops of water moving in the same direction 
constitute a current, millions of electrons moving in the same direction make 
an electric current. In fact, Benjamin Franklin came up with the idea that 
 electricity acts like a fluid and has similar properties, such as current and 
pressure.
