Two important laws are based on the physical properties of
electric charges, and these laws form the foundation of circuit
analysis. They are Kirchhoff ’s current law (KVL) and Kirch-
hoff ’s voltage law (KCL). While Kirchhoff ’s current law is based
on the principle of conservation of electric charge, Kirchhoff ’s
voltage law is based on the principle of energy conservation.
