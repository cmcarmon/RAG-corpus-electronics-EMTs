ELECTRON-RESONANCE MAGNETRON.â€”In the electron-resonance magnetron, the plate is 
constructed to resonate and function as a tank circuit. Thus, the magnetron has no external tuned circuits. 
Power is delivered directly from the tube through transmission lines, as shown in figure 2-25. The 
constants and operating conditions of the tube are such that the electron paths are somewhat different 
from those in figure 2-24. Instead of closed spirals or loops, the path is a curve having a series of sharp 
points, as illustrated in figure 2-26. Ordinarily, this type of magnetron has more than two segments in the 
plate. For example, figure 2-26 illustrates an eight-segment plate.
