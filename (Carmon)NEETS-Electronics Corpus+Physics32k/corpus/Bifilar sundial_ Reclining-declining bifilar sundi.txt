Whether a sundial is a bifilar, or whether it's the familiar flat-dial with a straight style (like the usual horizontal and vertical-declining sundials), making it reclining, vertical-declining, or reclining-declining is exactly the same. The declining or reclining-declining mounting is achieved in exactly the same manner, whether the dial is bifilar, or the usual straight-style flat dial.
For any flat-dial, whether bifilar, or ordinary straight-style, the north celestial pole has a certain altitude, measured from the plane of the dial.
Effective latitude:If that dial-plane is horizontal, then it's a horizontal dial (bifilar, or straight-style). Then, of course the north celestial pole's altitude, measured from the dial-plane, is the latitude of the location. Well then, if the flat-dial is reclined, declined, or reclined-&-declined, everything is the same as if it the dial were horizontal, with the celestial pole's altitude, measured with respect to the dial-plane, treated as the latitude.
Dial-North:Likewise, the north celestial pole's longitude, measured with respect to the plane of the dial, with respect to the downward direction (or the direction that a marble would roll, if the dial is reclining) on the dial-face, is the direction that is treated as north, when drawing the hour-lines. I'll call that direction "dial-north".
Equatorial Longitude (hour-angle) of dial-north:It's necessary to find the equatorial longitude of the dial-north direction (drawn on the dial). In the case of the horizontal dial, of course that's an hour-angle of zero, the south meridian. That determines what time ("dial-north time") is represented by the dial-north line. Other times, before and after that, can then have their lines drawn according to their differences from dial-north time--in the same way as they' be drawn on a horizontal dial-face according to their differences from 12 noon (true solar time).
