The schematic shown in figure 4-37 is that of a shunt voltage regulator. Notice that Q1 is in parallel 
with the load. Components of this circuit are identical with those of the series voltage regulator except for 
the addition of fixed resistor RS. As you study the schematic, you will see that this resistor is connected in 
series with the output load resistance. The current limiting resistor (R1) and Zener diode (CR1) provide a 
constant reference voltage for the base-collector junction of Q1. Notice that the bias of Q1 is determined 
by the voltage drop across RS and R1. As you should know, the amount of forward bias across a transistor 
affects its total resistance. In this case, the voltage drop across RS is the key to the total circuit operation.
