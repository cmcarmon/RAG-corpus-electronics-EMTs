Within the matched Berenger medium, the transmitted
wave propagates with the same speed and direction as the
impinging wave while simultaneously undergoing exponential
decay along the x-axis normal to the interface between regions
1 and 2. Further, the attenuation factor sxZ1 cos u is independ-
ent of frequency. These desirable properties apply to all angles
of incidence. Hence, Berenger’s coining of the term ‘‘perfectly
matched layer’’ makes excellent sense.
