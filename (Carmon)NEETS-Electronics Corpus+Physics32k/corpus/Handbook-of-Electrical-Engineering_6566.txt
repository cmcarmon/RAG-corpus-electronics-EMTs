Receiver
Because of the low power levels expected at the input to the receiver, an electronic ampliﬁer is normally required
following the photodetector. The remainder of the receiver includes such electronic elements as band-limiting
ﬁlters, equalizers, decision-making circuitry, other ampliﬁcation stages, switching networks, digital-to-analog
converters, and output devices (e.g., telephones, video monitors, and computers).
