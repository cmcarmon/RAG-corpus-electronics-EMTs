â€¢ There  is  overhead  in  using  HLL  conventions,  some  of  which  can  be  eliminated  by  directly  coding  in
assembly language. A typical embedded processor does not need the full span of HLL conventions and
support,  such  as  parameter  passing  or  memory  and  stack  allocation.  One  can  get  away  with  such
dangerous things as global variables which do not have to be passed at all. By eliminating these conven-
tions,  increased  performance  is  obtained.  It  should  be  pointed  out  that  code  written  without  such
standard conventions is likely to be very peculiar, bug-prone, and hard to maintain.
