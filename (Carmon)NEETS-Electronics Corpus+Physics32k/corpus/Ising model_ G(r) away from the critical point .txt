When t does not equal zero, so that H is fluctuating at a temperature slightly away from critical, the two point function decays at long distances. The equation it obeys is altered:

For r small compared with





t




{\displaystyle {\sqrt {t}}}
, the solution diverges exactly the same way as in the critical case, but the long distance behavior is modified.
To see how, it is convenient to represent the two point function as an integral, introduced by Schwinger in the quantum field theory context:

{\displaystyle G(x)=\int d\tau {1 \over \left({\sqrt {2\pi \tau }}\right)^{d}}e^{-{x^{2} \over 4\tau }-t\tau }}

This is G, since the Fourier transform of this integral is easy. Each fixed τ contribution is a Gaussian in x, whose Fourier transform is another Gaussian of reciprocal width in k.

{\displaystyle G(k)=\int d\tau e^{-(k^{2}-t)\tau }={1 \over k^{2}-t}}

This is the inverse of the operator ∇2 − t in k-space, acting on the unit function in k-space, which is the Fourier transform of a delta function source localized at the origin. So it satisfies the same equation as G with the same boundary conditions that determine the strength of the divergence at 0.
The interpretation of the integral representation over the proper time τ is that the two point function is the sum over all random walk paths that link position 0 to position x over time τ. The density of these paths at time τ at position x is Gaussian, but the random walkers disappear at a steady rate proportional to t so that the Gaussian at time τ is diminished in height by a factor that decreases steadily exponentially. In the quantum field theory context, these are the paths of relativistically localized quanta in a formalism that follows the paths of individual particles. In the pure statistical context, these paths still appear by the mathematical correspondence with quantum fields, but their interpretation is less directly physical.
The integral representation immediately shows that G(r) is positive, since it is represented as a weighted sum of positive Gaussians. It also gives the rate of decay at large r, since the proper time for a random walk to reach position τ is r2 and in this time, the Gaussian height has decayed by

{\displaystyle e^{-t\tau }=e^{-tr^{2}}}
. The decay factor appropriate for position r is therefore

{\displaystyle G(r)\approx {e^{-{\sqrt {t}}r} \over r^{d-2}}}

This is not an exact form, except in three dimensions, where interactions between paths become important. The exact forms in high dimensions are variants of Bessel functions.
