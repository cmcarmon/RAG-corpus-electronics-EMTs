Water molecules dissociate into equal amounts of H3O+ and OH−, so their concentrations are equal to 1.00×10−7 mol dm−3 at 25 °C. A solution in which the H3O+ and OH− concentrations equal each other is considered a neutral solution. In general, the pH of the neutral point is numerically equal to 1/2pKw.
Pure water is neutral, but most water samples contain impurities. If an impurity is an acid or base, this will affect the concentrations of hydronium ion and hydroxide ion. Water samples that are exposed to air will absorb some acidic carbon dioxide to form carbonic acid (H2CO3) and the concentration of H3O+ will increase due to the reaction H2CO3 + H2O = HCO3− + H3O+. The concentration of OH− will decrease in such a way that the product [H3O+][OH−] remains constant for fixed temperature and pressure. Thus these water samples will be slightly acidic. If a pH of exactly 7.0 is required, it must be maintained with an appropriate buffer solution.
