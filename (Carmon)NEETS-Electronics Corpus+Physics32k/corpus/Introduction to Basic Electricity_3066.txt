Once the P–N junction is formed, the diode must 
be packaged to protect it from both environmental and 
mechanical stresses. The package must also provide a 
means of connecting the diode to a circuit. Package 
style is determined by the purpose or application of 
the diode (Figure 29-8). If large currents are to flow 
through the diode, the package must be designed to 
keep the junction from overheating. Figure 29-9 shows 
the package for diodes rated at 3 A or less. A black, 
white, or silver band on the end identifies the cathode.
