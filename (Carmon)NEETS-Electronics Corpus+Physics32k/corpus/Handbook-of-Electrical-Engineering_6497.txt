Using  RF  techniques  offers  an  additional  level  of  RF
compression,  wherein  advanced  multilevel  modulation
formats are used to maximize the number of bits per hertz
of  bandwidth  [Feher,  1987].  Quadrature-amplitude
modulation (QAM) is one example of multilevel digital-
to-RF  conversion.  For  example,  64-QAM  uses  8  ampli-
tude and 8 phase levels and requires only 1 Hz for 5 bits
of information. As the number of levels, hence the num-
ber of bits per hertz, increases, the CNR of the channel
must increase to maintain error-free transmission. A 64-
QAM channel requires a CNR of approximately 30 dB.
A  synopsis  of  the  bandwidth  and  CNR  requirements
for  FM, AM-VSB,  and  CDV  is  shown  in  Fig. 71.1. AM-
VSB  requires  high  CNR  but  low  bandwidth.  FM  is  the
opposite. Digital video can occupy a wide area, depending
on the degree of digital and RF compression. The com-
bination  of  CDV  and  QAM  offers  the  possibility  of
squeezing  a  high-quality  video  channel  into  1  MHz  of
bandwidth, with a required CNR of 30 dB. This drastic
improvement  over AM-VSB  or  FM  could  have  tremen-
dous impact on future video transmission systems.
