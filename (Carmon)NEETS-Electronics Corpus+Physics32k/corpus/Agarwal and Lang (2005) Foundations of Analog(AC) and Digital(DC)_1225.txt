As an example of circuit delays, and the importance of time in describing the
response of a circuit, consider the two cascaded inverters shown in Figure 9.1.
The ideal response of the first inverter, based on our analysis of electronic circuits
to this point, is shown in Figure 9.2. A square-wave input yields an inverted
square-wave output. However, in reality, the output shown in Figure 9.3 is
more likely to occur, which is a much more complex function of time. This
example is discussed in detail in Section 10.4, where we will show that the
complex time behavior shown in Figure 9.3 directly relates to the speed at
which circuits can operate. In this chapter, we will lay the foundation for that
discussion.
