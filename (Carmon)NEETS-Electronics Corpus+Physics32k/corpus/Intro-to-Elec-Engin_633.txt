The immobile ions (or space charge), being of opposite polarity on each side of the junction,
establish an electric ﬁeld because of which a potential barrier is formed and drift current is
produced. The drift current causes holes to move from the n- to the p-region and electrons to
move from the p- to the n- region, as shown in Figure 7.2.2(c). In equilibrium and with no
external circuit, the drift and diffusion components of current are equal and oppositely directed.
The potential barrier established across the depletion region prohibits the ﬂow of carriers across
the junction without the application of energy from an external source.
