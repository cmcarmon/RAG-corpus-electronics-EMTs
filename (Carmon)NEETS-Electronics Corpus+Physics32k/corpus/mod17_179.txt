Ship-to-Shore.â€”Many ships handle enough message traffic to justify ship-to-shore teletypewriter
circuits. Depending on traffic load, these circuits may contain from one to four (minimum) teletypewriter
circuits on one sideband circuit. If the traffic load warrants more than one teletypewriter circuit, we
usually use time division multiplex or frequency division multiplex (mux) equipment. This equipment is
capable of handling many incoming and outgoing circuits. One circuit normally is used as an
ORDERWIRE CIRCUIT for operator-to-operator service messages and for making frequency changes
when necessary. The remaining circuits are available for handling official message traffic.
