You have studied six methods of amplitude modulation. These are not the only methods available, 
but they are the most common. All methods of AM modulation use the same theory of heterodyning 
across a nonlinear device. AM modulation is one of the easiest and least expensive types of modulation to 
achieve. The primary disadvantages of AM modulation are susceptibility to noise interference and the 
inefficiency of the transmitter. Power is wasted in the transmission of the carrier frequency because it 
contains no AM intelligence. In the next chapter, you will study other forms of modulation that have been 
developed to overcome these disadvantages.
