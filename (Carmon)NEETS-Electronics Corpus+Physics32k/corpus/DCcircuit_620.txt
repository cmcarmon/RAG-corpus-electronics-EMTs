But how do we apply the same Ohm’s Law formula (E=IR) to the R1//R2 column, where we
have resistance decreasing and current increasing? It’s easy to determine if only one variable is
changing, as it was with R3//R4, but with two variables moving around and no deﬁnite numbers
to work with, Ohm’s Law isn’t going to be much help. However, there is another rule we can
apply horizontally to determine what happens to the voltage across R1//R2: the rule for voltage
in series circuits. If the voltages across R1//R2 and R3//R4 add up to equal the total (battery)
voltage and we know that the R3//R4 voltage has increased while total voltage has stayed the
same, then the voltage across R1//R2 must have decreased with the change of R2’s resistance
