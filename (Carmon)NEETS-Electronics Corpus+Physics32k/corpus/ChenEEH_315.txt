If the gate voltage is changed by a small positive amount, a
small positive charge will ﬂow into the gate. To preserve charge
neutrality, an equal amount of charge must ﬂow out of the
semiconductor. The relation of the small change in charge due
to a small change in voltage is deﬁned as the small-signal
capacitance and can be written as:
