These two distances are then treated as a 2-D feature vector,
and an unsupervised K-means clustering algorithm is used to
group shot boundaries into one cluster. For a review of major
conventional shot boundary detection techniques, refer to
Borecsky and Rowe (1996), which also provides a comparison
between ﬁve different techniques based on pixel difference
from raw data, DCT coefﬁcients difference, and motion-
compensated difference. Due to the huge amount of data to
be processed in the case of full-frame pixel difference-based
methods as well as data’s susceptibility to intensity differences
caused by motion,
illumination changes, and noise, many
novel techniques (beyond the scope of the review presented
