Because indirectly heated cathodes are relatively large, they take longer to heat to electron-emitting
temperature. Once up to temperature, however, they do not respond to the small variations in heater
temperature caused by ac fluctuations. Because of the inherent advantages, most tubes in use today have
indirectly heated cathodes.
