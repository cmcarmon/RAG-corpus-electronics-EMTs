The objective of a Bayes criterion is to minimize the so-called
Bayes’ risk which is, again, deﬁned as the expected value of the
cost. To derive a Bayes’ detection rule, the costs of making
decisions need to be deﬁned ﬁrst. Let the costs be denoted by
Cij being cost of choosing i when j is true. In particular:
