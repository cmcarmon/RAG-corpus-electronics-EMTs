Texas is the only state that does not prescribe a different speed limit for each road type in its state or federal highway system. Texas law generally prescribes a statutory speed limit of 70 miles per hour (113 km/h) for any rural road that is numbered by the state or federal government (United States Numbered Highways and Interstate Highways)—whether two lane, four lane, freeway, or otherwise—60 miles per hour (97 km/h) for roads outside an urban district that are not federal or state highways, and 30 miles per hour (48 km/h) for streets in an urban district.
The law allows raising or lowering the statutory limit only if an engineering and traffic investigation indicates that a different limit is appropriate. Texas allows a speed limit of up to 75 miles per hour (121 km/h) to be posted on federal or state highways, city maintained roads, and toll roads, and up to 70 miles per hour (113 km/h) on county roads. Through a separate provision, speed limits up to 80 or 85 mph can be established on certain highways.
