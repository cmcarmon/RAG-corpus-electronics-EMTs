The idea of a ponderomotive description of particles under the action of a time-varying field has applications in areas like:
Combined rf trap
High harmonic generation
Plasma acceleration of particles
Plasma propulsion engine especially the Electrodeless plasma thruster
Quadrupole ion trap
Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy as a source of high energy THz radiation in laser-induced air plasmas
The ponderomotive force also plays an important role in laser induced plasmas as a major density lowering factor.
