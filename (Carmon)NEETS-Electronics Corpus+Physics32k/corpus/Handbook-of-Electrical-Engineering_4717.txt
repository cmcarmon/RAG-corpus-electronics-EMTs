in  which 
  is  the  coefÔ¨Åcient  of  viscosity.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  attenuation  constant  for  viscous  loss
increases  as  the  square  of  the  frequency.  In  polycrystalline  solids  there  is  also  loss  due  to  scattering  from
dislocation  and  grain  structure;  thus,  for  the  same  material  the  loss  at  high  frequencies  is  much  higher  in  a
polycrystalline form than in a crystalline one. As a result, in high-frequency applications of ultrasound, such
as for signal processing, the propagation material is usually in single-crystal form.
