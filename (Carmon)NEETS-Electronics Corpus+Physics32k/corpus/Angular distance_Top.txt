In mathematics (in particular geometry and trigonometry) and all natural sciences (e.g. astronomy and geophysics), the angular distance (angular separation, apparent distance, or apparent separation) between two point objects, as viewed from a location different from either of these objects, is the angle of length between the two directions originating from the observer and pointing toward these two objects.
