One theory after another attracted the approval and acceptance of physicists. Today, some scientific
phenomena can be explained only by the wave theory and others only by the particle theory. Physicists,
constantly searching for some new discovery that would bring these two theories into agreement,
gradually have come to accept a theory that combines the principles of the two theories.
