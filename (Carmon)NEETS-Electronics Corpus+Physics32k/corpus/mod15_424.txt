A STEP-TRANSMISSION SYSTEM (STEP-BY-STEP SYSTEM) is similar to a synchro
system, except that it is energized by direct current. This system uses a rotary switch to transfer angular
data (information) between remote locations. The system is cheap, rugged, relatively powerful, but is not
used where small changes in data are required.
