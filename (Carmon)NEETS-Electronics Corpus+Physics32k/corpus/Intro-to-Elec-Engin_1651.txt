The transient portion of the time response of a stable control system is that part which goes to
zero as time increases and becomes sufÔ¨Åciently large. The transient behavior of a control system
is usually characterized by the use of a unit-step input. Typical performance criteria that are used
to characterize the transient response to a unit-step input include overshoot, delay time, rise time,
and settling time. Figure 16.2.6 illustrates a typical unit-step response of a linear control system.
The following four quantities give a direct measure of the transient characteristics of the step
response:
