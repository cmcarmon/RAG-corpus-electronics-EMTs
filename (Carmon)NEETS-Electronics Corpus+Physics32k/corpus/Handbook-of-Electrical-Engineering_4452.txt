The most commonly used conﬁguration for microwave switches is the single-pole double throw (SPDT) as
shown in Fig. 43.10(a), which requires a minimum of two switching devices (diodes or transistors). Table 43.5
provides typical performance for broadband SPDT switches developed using GaAs MESFET monolithic tech-
nology. Table 43.5 also summarizes performance for phase shifters and attenuators, which are described brieﬂy
below.
