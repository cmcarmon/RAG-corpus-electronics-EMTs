Statistical mechanics shows that, for a gas of constant temperature, T, its pressure, p will vary with height, h, as:

{\displaystyle p(h)=p(0)e^{-{\frac {Mgh}{kT}}}}

where:
g is the acceleration due to gravity
T is the absolute temperature
k is Boltzmann constant
M is the mass of a single molecule of gas
p is the pressure
h is the height
This is known as the barometric formula, and may be derived from assuming the pressure is hydrostatic.
If there are multiple types of molecules in the gas, the partial pressure of each type will be given by this equation. Under most conditions, the distribution of each species of gas is independent of the other species.
