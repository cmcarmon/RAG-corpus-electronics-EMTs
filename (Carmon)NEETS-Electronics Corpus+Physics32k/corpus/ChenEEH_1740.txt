2. Forward error correction (FEC): This second approach
provides sufÔ¨Åcient redundancy in packets so that errors
can be corrected without the need for retransmissions.
It can be used by User Datagram Protocol (UDP),
another transport layer protocol in the TCP/IP proto-
col stack that provides connectionless unreliable ser-
vice. Applications that exchange error-tolerant media
types (both RT and NRT) typically use UDP for trans-
port because it eliminates time lost in retransmissions.
Leigh et al. (2001) have conducted experiments using
FEC along with UDP over a global high-bandwidth
communication network, STARTAP.
