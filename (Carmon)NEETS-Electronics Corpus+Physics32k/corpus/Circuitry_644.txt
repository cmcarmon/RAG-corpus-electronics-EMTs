a  frequency  of  50  MHz.  Determine  the  
 
 
approximate length of the aerial. 
13.8  A  power  of  150  W  is  applied  to  a  dipole 
aerial  in  order  to  produce  a  given  signal 
 
strength  at  a  remote  location.  What  power, 
 
applied  to  a  Yagi  aerial  with  a  gain  of  
 
 
8  dBd, would  be  required  to  produce  the 
 
same signal strength?
