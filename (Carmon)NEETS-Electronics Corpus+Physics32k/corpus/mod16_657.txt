Before turning on the scope, make sure it is plugged into the proper power source. This may seem
obvious, but many technicians have turned all knobs on the front panel out of adjustment before they
noticed that the power cord was not plugged in. On some scopes, the POWER switch is part of the
INTEN (intensity) control. Turn or pull the knob until you hear a click or a panel light comes on (figure
6-31). Let the scope warm up for a few minutes so that voltages in all of the circuits become stabilized.
