More recent research has shown that pin-junction diodes and simple pn-junction diodes can show 
negative resistance and amplification at microwave frequencies when they are reverse biased into an 
avalanche condition. The negative resistance in a simple pn-junction or pin diode is the result of a more 
complicated internal mechanism than in the pnin diode. The avalanche region and the drift region of the 
pnin diode are physically separate. Diodes of the pn and pin type must use the same physical region for 
both avalanche and drift-time control. In all types of avalanche transit-time diodes, the negative-resistance 
property causes dc bias energy to be absorbed by electrons in the avalanche process and given up to the 
applied microwave field.
