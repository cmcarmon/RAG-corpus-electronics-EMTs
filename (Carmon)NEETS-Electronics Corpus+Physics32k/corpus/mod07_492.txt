The input capacitor (C1) has the greatest pulsating voltage applied to it, is the most susceptible to 
voltage surges, and has a generally higher average voltage applied. As a result, the input capacitor is 
frequently subject to voltage breakdown and shorting. The output capacitor (C2) is not as susceptible to 
voltage surges because of the series protection offered by the series inductor (L1), but the capacitor can 
become open, leaky, or shorted.
