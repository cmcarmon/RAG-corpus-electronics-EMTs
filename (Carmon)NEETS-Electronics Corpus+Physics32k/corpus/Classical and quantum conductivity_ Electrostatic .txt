The net attractive portion of the potential energy of an ion in a crystal is dependent on the following: the square of the electric charge of an electron, the Boltzmann constant, the inverse of the distance between ions, as well as the Madelung constant. The Madelung constant is the result of a mathematical sum, which is dependent on the number of ions at a certain distance from a given ion. The repelling portion of the potential energy of an ion is dependent on a constant A, and inversely, exponentially dependent on the distance between ions. By writing an equation for the total potential energy (the sum of the attractive and repulsive portions), taking its derivative with respect to the distance between ions (which is equal to the force at equilibrium separation), as well as setting that result equal to zero and using the equilibrium separation as the distance between ions, then the constant, A, can be determined. Using all of this information, a simple expression can be written for the total potential energy of the ion. Now it is dependent only on the Madelung constant, Boltzmannâ€™s constant, the equilibrium separation, the square of the charge of an electron, and a number n (the exponential factor for the distance between ions in the repulsive portion of the potential energy). Since the equilibrium separation can be determined experimentally, and the total potential energy can be accurately estimated based on the lattice energy of the ionic crystal, this number, n, can be determined as well.
The structure of covalently bonded crystals is determined by the directional nature of the bonds. This directional nature is a result of the specific hybridizations that exist for different shapes.
