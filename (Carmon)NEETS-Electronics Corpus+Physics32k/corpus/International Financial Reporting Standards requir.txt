Inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value (IAS2.9). This is similar in principle to lower of cost or market (LOCOM) in US GAAP.
'Cost' comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing items to their present location and condition (IAS2.10). Where individual items are not identifiable, the "first in first out" (FIFO) or weighted average cost formula is used. "Last in first out" (LIFO) is not acceptable (IAS2.25).
'Net realisable value' is the estimated selling price less the costs to complete and costs to sell.
