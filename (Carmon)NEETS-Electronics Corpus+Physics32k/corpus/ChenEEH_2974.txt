Design for microwave- and millimeter-wave frequency circuits
are fundamentally different from the approach used at lower
frequencies. Since measurements at these frequencies most
naturally consist of S-parameter measurements, components
are most commonly characterized by their S-parameter re-
sponse. Design techniques also naturally reﬂect this. This
section brieﬂy outlines microwave ampliﬁer design, oscillator
design, and detectors and mixers. Because these circuits are
most commonly used in communications with tight EMI and
linearity constraints, issues such as intermodulation distortion,
harmonic generation, saturation, and nonlinear models are
brieﬂy discussed in applicable contexts. An excellent reference
on microwave ampliﬁer design is Gonzalez (1996). A good
reference dealing with many practical aspects of nonlinear
circuits Maas (1998).
