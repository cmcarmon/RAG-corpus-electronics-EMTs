The conservation of charge, for example, in the notation of Maxwell's equations,







∂
ρ


∂
t



+
∇
⋅

J

=
0


{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \rho }{\partial t}}+\nabla \cdot \mathbf {J} =0}

where:
ρ is the free electric charge density (in units of C/m³)
J is the current density:
J =



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
v
v is the velocity of the charges.
The equation would apply equally to masses (or other conserved quantities), where the word mass is substituted for the words electric charge above.
