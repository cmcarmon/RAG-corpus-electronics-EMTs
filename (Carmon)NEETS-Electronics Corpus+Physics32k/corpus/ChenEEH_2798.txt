Two-Dimensional TMz Case
The analysis of the previous section can be repeated for the
case of a TMz-polarized incident wave wherein we implement
the ﬁeld splitting Ez ¼ Ezx þ Ezy . Analogous to equations 9.92,
Maxwell’s curl equations 9.11a to 9.11c as modiﬁed by Beren-
ger are expressed in their time-dependent form as:
