When  the  term  digital  control  is  used,  it  usually  refers  to  the  process  of  employing  a  digital  computer  to
control some process that is characterized by continuous-in-time dynamics. The control can be of the open-
loop variety where the control strategy output by the digital computer is dictated without regard to the status
of the process variables. An alternative technique is to supply the digital computer with digital data about the
process variables to be controlled, and thus the control strategy output by the computer depends on the process
variables that are to be controlled. This latter strategy is a feedback control strategy wherein the computer, the
process, and interface hardware form a closed loop of information ï¬‚ow.
