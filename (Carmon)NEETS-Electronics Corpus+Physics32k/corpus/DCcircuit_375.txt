Of the two ”V” settings and two ”A” settings, you will notice that each pair is divided into
unique markers with either a pair of horizontal lines (one solid, one dashed), or a dashed line
with a squiggly curve over it. The parallel lines represent ”DC” while the squiggly curve repre-
sents ”AC.” The ”V” of course stands for ”voltage” while the ”A” stands for ”amperage” (current).
The meter uses different techniques, internally, to measure DC than it uses to measure AC,
and so it requires the user to select which type of voltage (V) or current (A) is to be measured.
Although we haven’t discussed alternating current (AC) in any technical detail, this distinction
in meter settings is an important one to bear in mind.
