Next, let us consider the time instant when the input voltage switches from
0 volts to 5 volts, turning the first MOSFET on. Let us assume that this 0-V to
5-V transition happens after a sufficiently long period of time so that CGS2 is
initially charged up to its steady state value of 5 V. When the first gate is turned
on, CGS2 begins to discharge. The RC circuit and its Th√©venin equivalent for the
discharge is shown in Figure 10.22. For the logical 0 to logical 1 transition at the
input to be reflected at the output of inverter A, the voltage across CGS2 needs
to go below the valid logical output low threshold, VOL. As before, although
MOSFET B will turn off when vOUT1 drops below 1 volt, we require the output
to go below VOL to provide for an adequate noise margin. The interval of time
corresponding to the output capacitor discharge for an inverter is also called
the propagation delay for the inverter for a low to high transition at the input and
