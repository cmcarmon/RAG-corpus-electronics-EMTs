The most apparent difference between a real diode and the ideal diode is the nonzero voltage
drop when a real diode conducts in the forward direction. The Ô¨Ånite voltage drop across the diode
is accounted for by V on, known as the offset or turn-on or cut-in or threshold voltage, as shown
in the alternate representation of the junction diode in Figure 7.2.5(a). Typical values of V on are
0.6 to 0.7 V for silicon devices and 0.2 to 0.3 V for germanium devices.
