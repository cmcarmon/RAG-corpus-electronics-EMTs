We can apply the Kramers–Kronig formalism to response functions. In certain linear physical systems, or in engineering fields such as signal processing, the response function



χ
(
t
−

t
′

)



{\displaystyle \chi (t-t')\!}
describes how some time-dependent property



P
(
t
)



{\displaystyle P(t)\!}
of a physical system responds to an impulse force



F
(

t
′

)



{\displaystyle F(t')\!}
at time




t
′

.


{\displaystyle t'.}
For example,



P
(
t
)



{\displaystyle P(t)\!}
could be the angle of a pendulum and



F
(
t
)


{\displaystyle F(t)}
the applied force of a motor driving the pendulum motion. The response



χ
(
t
−

t
′

)


{\displaystyle \chi (t-t')}
must be zero for



t
<

t
′




{\displaystyle t<t'\!}
since a system cannot respond to a force before it is applied. It can be shown (for instance, by invoking Titchmarsh's theorem) that this causality condition implies that the Fourier transform



χ
(
ω
)



{\displaystyle \chi (\omega )\!}
of



χ
(
t
)



{\displaystyle \chi (t)\!}
is analytic in the upper half plane. Additionally, if we subject the system to an oscillatory force with a frequency much higher than its highest resonant frequency, there will be almost no time for the system to respond before the forcing has switched direction, and so the frequency response



χ
(
ω
)



{\displaystyle \chi (\omega )\!}
will converge to zero as



ω



{\displaystyle \omega \!}
becomes very large. From these physical considerations, we see that



χ
(
ω
)



{\displaystyle \chi (\omega )\!}
will typically satisfy the conditions needed for the Kramers–Kronig relations to apply.
The imaginary part of a response function describes how a system dissipates energy, since it is in phase with the driving force. The Kramers–Kronig relations imply that observing the dissipative response of a system is sufficient to determine its out of phase (reactive) response, and vice versa.
The integrals run from



−
∞


{\displaystyle -\infty }
to



∞


{\displaystyle \infty }
, implying we know the response at negative frequencies. Fortunately, in most systems, the positive frequency-response determines the negative-frequency response because



χ
(
ω
)


{\displaystyle \chi (\omega )}
is the Fourier transform of a real quantity



χ
(
t
)


{\displaystyle \chi (t)}
. We will make this assumption henceforth.
As a consequence,



χ
(
−
ω
)
=

χ

∗


(
ω
)


{\displaystyle \chi (-\omega )=\chi ^{*}(\omega )}
. This means




χ

1


(
ω
)


{\displaystyle \chi _{1}(\omega )}
is an even function of frequency and




χ

2


(
ω
)


{\displaystyle \chi _{2}(\omega )}
is odd.
Using these properties, we can collapse the integration ranges to



[
0
,
∞
)


{\displaystyle [0,\infty )}
. Consider the first relation, which gives the real part




χ

1


(
ω
)


{\displaystyle \chi _{1}(\omega )}
. We transform the integral into one of definite parity by multiplying the numerator and denominator of the integrand by




ω

{\displaystyle \omega '+\omega }
and separating:

Since

{\displaystyle \chi _{2}(\omega )}

These are the Kramers–Kronig relations in a form that is useful for physically realistic response functions.
