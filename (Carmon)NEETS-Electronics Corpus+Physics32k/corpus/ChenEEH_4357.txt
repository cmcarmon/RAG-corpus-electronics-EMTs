Stability is mostly concerned with dynamical systems. It is a
fundamental requirement in most engineering applications
that the systems designed are stable. In control engineering
applications, the design of a control system must Ô¨Årst guaran-
tee the stability of the overall system. That is to say, one of the
design objectives that must be guaranteed in a controller
design for a given system is stability. Stability is always a
requirement independent of the technique used in the control-
ler design, be it by linear control, adaptive control, optimal
control, intelligent control, and the like.
