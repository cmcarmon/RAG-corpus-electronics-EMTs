An ideal magnetic particle is needle-shaped. Itâ€™s actual size depends on the frequency of the signal to
be recorded. Generally, long particles are used to record long wavelength signals (low-frequency signals),
and short particles are used to record short wavelength signals (high-frequency signals).
