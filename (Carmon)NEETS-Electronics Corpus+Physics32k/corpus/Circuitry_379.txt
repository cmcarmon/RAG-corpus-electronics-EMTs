Example 7.9 
 
The characteristic curves shown in Fig. 7.37 relate 
to a transistor operating in common-emitter mode. 
If the transistor is operated with IB = 30 µA, a load 
resistor  of  1.2  kP and  an  18  V  supply,  determine 
the  quiescent  values  of  collector  voltage  and 
current  (VCQ  and  ICQ).  Also  determine  the  peak-
peak output voltage that would be produced by an 
input signal of 40 µA peak-peak. 
 
Solution 
 
First  we  need  to  construct  the  load  line.  The  two 
ends of the load line will correspond to VCC (18 V)
