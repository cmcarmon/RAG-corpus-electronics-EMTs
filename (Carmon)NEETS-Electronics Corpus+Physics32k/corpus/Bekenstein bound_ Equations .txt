The universal form of the bound was originally found by Jacob Bekenstein as the inequality




S
≤



2
π
k
R
E


ℏ
c





{\displaystyle S\leq {\frac {2\pi kRE}{\hbar c}}}

where S is the entropy, k is Boltzmann's constant, R is the radius of a sphere that can enclose the given system, E is the total mass–energy including any rest masses, ħ is the reduced Planck constant, and c is the speed of light. Note that while gravity plays a significant role in its enforcement, the expression for the bound does not contain the gravitational constant G.
In informational terms, the bound is given by

{\displaystyle I\leq {\frac {2\pi RE}{\hbar c\ln 2}}}

where I is the information expressed in number of bits contained in the quantum states in the sphere. The ln 2 factor comes from defining the information as the logarithm to the base 2 of the number of quantum states. Using mass energy equivalence, the informational limit may be reformulated as
