In space, NASA used a mechanical arm for new planetary discoveries. One of these discoveries came from sending a rover to another planet and collecting samples from this planet.With a rover, NASA can just keep the rover on its designated planet and explore all they want. Mechanical arms are also attached to the ships that are acting as satellite stations in Earth's atmosphere because they help grab degrees that might cause damage to other satellites. Not only that, but they also keep astronauts safe when they have to go make a repair to the ship or satellite. Now, space isn’t where all the rover’s with mechanical arms are. Even the SWAT team and other special forces use these rovers to go into a building or unsafe area to defuse a bomb, plant a bomb or repair vehicles.
