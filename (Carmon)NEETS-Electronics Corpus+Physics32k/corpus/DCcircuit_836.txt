Now, the calibration span of the resistor network is only 500 Ω, from 8 kΩ to 8.5 kΩ. This
makes a precision of +/- 1 Ω equal to 1 part in 500, or 0.2 percent. The adjustment is now
half as sensitive as it was before the addition of the parallel resistor, facilitating much easier
calibration to the target value. The adjustment will not be linear, unfortunately (halfway on
the potentiometer’s shaft position will not result in 8.25 kΩ total resistance, but rather 8.333
kΩ). Still, it is an improvement in terms of sensitivity, and it is a practical solution to our
problem of building an adjustable resistance for a precision instrument!
