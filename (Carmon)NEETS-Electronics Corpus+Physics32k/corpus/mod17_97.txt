The hf band is shared by many domestic and foreign users, and only portions scattered throughout 
the band are allocated to the military services. Like other agencies, Navy requirements have grown; the 
capacity of the Navy's assigned portion of the hf spectrum has become severely taxed. The use of single-
sideband equipment and the application of independent sideband techniques have increased the capacity, 
but not enough to catch up with the demand. Some predict that satellite communications will eventually 
relieve congestion in the hf band and that, for some types of service, it will replace hf for long-distance 
communications. We will present more information to you concerning satellite communications in 
chapter 3. Even with new technology the hf spectrum most likely will continue to be in high demand for 
some time.
