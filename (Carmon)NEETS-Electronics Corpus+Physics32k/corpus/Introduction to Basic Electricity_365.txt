position requiring extensive  experience with 
the organization’s products or exact field of 
technology.
Most electronics technician job requirements re-
quire at least an associate (two-year technical) degree, 
a diploma from a vocational or technical school, or 
equivalent military training. If the education list on a 
résumé is not accurate, a job interview is very unlikely 
to be granted. Employers perform a background check 
and check references to verify any education claims.
