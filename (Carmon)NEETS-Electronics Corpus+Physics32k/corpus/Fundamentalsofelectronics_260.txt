Note that the op-amp is placed in the circuit “upside-down,” with its inverting input at the top and
serving as the only input. As we explore op-amps in more detail in the next section, this conﬁguration will
appear again and again, and its usefulness demonstrated. To determine how the output voltage is related to
the input voltage, we apply the node method. Only two node voltages— v and vout—need be deﬁned; the
remaining nodes are across sources or serve as the reference. The node equations are
