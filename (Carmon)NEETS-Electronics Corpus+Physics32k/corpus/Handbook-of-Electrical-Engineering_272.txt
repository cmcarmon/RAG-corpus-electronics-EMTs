In  this  section  Kirchhoff ’s  current  law  (KCL)  and  Kirchhoff ’s  voltage  law  (KVL)  will  be  used  to  determine
currents and voltages throughout a network. For simplicity, we will ﬁrst illustrate the basic principles of both
node analysis and mesh analysis using only dc circuits. Once the fundamental concepts have been explained
and illustrated, we will demonstrate the generality of both analysis techniques through an ac circuit example.
