The Voyager program consists of a pair of unmanned scientific probes, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2. They were launched in 1977 to take advantage of a favorable planetary alignment of the late 1970s. Although they were originally designated to study just Jupiter and Saturn, Voyager 2 was able to continue to Uranus and Neptune. Both missions have gathered large amounts of data about the gas giants of the solar system, of which little was previously known. Both probes have achieved escape velocity from the Solar System and will never return. Voyager 1 entered interstellar space in 2012.
As of February 11, 2018, Voyager 1 was at a distance of 141.538 AU (13.157 billion miles (21.174Ã—10^9 km)) from the Earth, traveling away from the Sun at a speed of about 10.6 mi/s (17.1 km/s), which corresponds to a greater specific orbital energy than any other probe.
