Though the polar moment of inertia is most often used to calculate the angular displacement of an object subjected to a moment (torque) applied parallel to the cross-section, it must be noted that the provided value of rigidity does not have any bearing on the torsional resistance provided to an object as a function of its constituent materials. The rigidity provided by an object's material is a characteristic of its shear modulus,



G


{\displaystyle G}
. Combining these two features, one is able to calculate a shaft's angular deflection,



θ


{\displaystyle \theta }
, due to the applied torque,



T


{\displaystyle T}
:




θ
=



T
L


J
G





{\displaystyle \theta ={\frac {TL}{JG}}}

Where



L


{\displaystyle L}
is the length of the shaft and



T


{\displaystyle T}
is the applied torque. As shown, the larger the material's shear modulus and polar moment of area (i.e. larger cross-sectional area), the greater resistance to torsional deflection.
The polar moment of area appears in the formulae that describe torsional stress and angular displacement.
Torsional stresses:




τ
=



T
r


J

z






{\displaystyle \tau ={\frac {Tr}{J_{z}}}}

Where



τ


{\displaystyle \tau }
is the torsional shear stress,



T


{\displaystyle T}
is the applied torque,



r


{\displaystyle r}
is the distance from the central axis, and




J

z




{\displaystyle J_{z}}
is the polar moment of area.
Note: In a circular shaft, the shear stress is maximal at the surface of the shaft.
