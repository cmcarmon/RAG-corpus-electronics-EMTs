Radar systems are often identified by the type of SCANNING the system uses. Scanning is the
systematic movement of a radar beam in a definite pattern while searching for or tracking a target. The
type and method of scanning used depends on the purpose and type of radar and on the antenna size and
design. In some cases, the type of scan will change with the particular system mode of operation. For
example, in a particular radar system, the search mode scan may be quite different from that of the track
mode scan.
