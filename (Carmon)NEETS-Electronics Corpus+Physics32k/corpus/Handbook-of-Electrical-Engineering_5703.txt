The  residential  and  commercial  power  system  contains  large  numbers  of  single-phase  converter-fed  power
supplies with capacitor output smoothing, such as TVs and PCs, as shown in Fig. 62.2. Although their individual
rating is insigniÔ¨Åcant, there is little diversity in their operation and their combined effect produces considerable
odd-harmonic  distortion.  The  gas  discharge  lamps  add  to  that  effect  as  they  produce  the  same  harmonic
components.
