Stars above 130 M☉ will have enough mass to create pairs of electrons and positrons; in these stars there will be greater pair production than in stars less than 130 M☉. Stars of 130 to 150 M☉ will often undergo pulsational pair-instability supernovae and potentially undergo more than one pulsation to bring its mass under 100 M☉ although they can potentially go full supernova. Stars above 150 M☉ will generally produce much greater levels of electron-positron pairs and will usually produce more than just that required of a pulsational pair-instability supernova. The star will heat up more than in the 100–130 M☉ stars and the thermal runaway reaction when the oxygen fuel ignites will be far greater. As a result, most stars above 150 M☉ will undergo a complete pair-instability supernova [2][1].
