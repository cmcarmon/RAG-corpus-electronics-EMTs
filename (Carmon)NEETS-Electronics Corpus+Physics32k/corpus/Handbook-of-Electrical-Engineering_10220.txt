When  the  surface  to  be  ﬁnished  is  very
rough  and  course,  several  different  grades  of
ﬁnishing media may be needed, as well as dif-
ferent speeds and power as the surface ﬁnish
is  transformed.  To  accommodate  this  multi-
step process within a single work cell, and with
a single robot, Robotics and Automation Cor-
poration  developed  the  automated  tool-
change system.
