Classical Arabic has sixteen established metres. Though each of them allows for a certain amount of variation, their basic patterns are as follows, using:
"â€“" for 1 long syllable
"u" for 1 short syllable
"x" for a position that can contain 1 long or 1 short
"o" for a position that can contain 1 long or 2 shorts
"S" for a position that can contain 1 long, 2 shorts, or 1 long + 1 short
