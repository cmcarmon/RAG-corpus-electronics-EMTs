In most applications, one stage of amplification is 
not enough; two or more stages are required to ob-
tain a higher gain. Two or more stages connected to-
gether are referred to as a multistage amplifier. 
 FigureÂ 38-2 shows a two-stage amplifier. The input 
signal is amplified by the first stage. The amplified 
signal is then applied to the base of the transistor in
