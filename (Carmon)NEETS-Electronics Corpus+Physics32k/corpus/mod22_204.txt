A keyboard is nothing more than an array of switches called keyswitches. Keyboards are designed to 
input a code to the computer when a keyswitch is depressed. Each keyswitch, or key, on the keyboard is 
assigned a particular code value; and it is usually imprinted with a legend to identify its function. Figure 
2-26 shows a keyboard combined with a crt on a microcomputer.
