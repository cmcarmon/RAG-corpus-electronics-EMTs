Historically, ampliﬁers have been designed with a graphical
approach using Smith charts and simultaneously plotting
circles for the parameters of interest, such as gain, stability,
voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR), or noise ﬁgure at a
particular frequency. A treatment of this technique is not
possible in this chapter due to space limitations. Most modern
microwave design CAD tools have built these functions into
their interface, and the user requires only a physical under-
standing of the technique rather than a detailed knowledge
of the equations for generating the circles that are involved.
This discussion, hence, focuses on presenting the most import-
ant parameters used for microwave ampliﬁers.
