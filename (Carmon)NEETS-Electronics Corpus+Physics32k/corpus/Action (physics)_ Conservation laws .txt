Implications of symmetries in a physical situation can be found with the action principle, together with the Eulerâ€“Lagrange equations, which are derived from the action principle. An example is Noether's theorem, which states that to every continuous symmetry in a physical situation there corresponds a conservation law (and conversely). This deep connection requires that the action principle be assumed.
