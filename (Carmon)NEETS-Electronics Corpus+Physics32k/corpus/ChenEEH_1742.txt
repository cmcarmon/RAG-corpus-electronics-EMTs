The RT continuous type of media can further be classiﬁed as
delay tolerant or delay intolerant. We cautiously use the term
delay tolerant to signify that such media type can tolerate
higher amounts of delay than their delay-intolerant counter-
parts without signiﬁcant performance degradation. Examples
of RT, continuous, and delay-intolerant media are audio and
video streams used in audio or video conferencing systems,
and remote desktop applications. Streaming audio/video
media used in applications like Internet Webcast are examples
of delay-tolerant media types. Their delay dependency is sig-
niﬁcantly diminished by having an adaptive buffer at the
receiver that downloads and stores a certain portion of the
media stream before starting playout. The entire classiﬁcation
has been carefully illustrated in Figure 7.2.
