When a generator delivers current to a load, the armature current creates a magnetic force that 
opposes the rotation of the armature. This is called MOTOR REACTION. A single armature conductor is 
represented in figure 1-10, view A. When the conductor is stationary, no voltage is generated and no 
current flows. Therefore, no force acts on the conductor. When the conductor is moved downward (fig. 1-
10, view B) and the circuit is completed through an external load, current flows through the conductor in 
the direction indicated. This sets up lines of flux around the conductor in a clockwise direction.
