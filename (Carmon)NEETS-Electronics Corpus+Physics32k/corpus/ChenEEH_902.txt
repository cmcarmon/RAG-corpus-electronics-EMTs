Clock Scheduling as a Quadratic Programming Problem
As discussed in the previous three subsections, a common
design objective is ensuring reliable system operation under a
target clock period. It is possible to redeﬁne the problem of
clock skew scheduling for this case. The input data for this
redeﬁned problem consists of:
