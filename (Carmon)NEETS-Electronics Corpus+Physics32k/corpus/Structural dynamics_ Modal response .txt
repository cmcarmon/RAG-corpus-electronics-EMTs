The complete modal response to a given load F(x,t) is



v
(

t
)
=
∑


u

(
x
,
t
)



{\displaystyle v(x,t)=\sum {u_{n}(x,t)}}
. The summation can be carried out by one of three common methods:
Superpose complete time histories of each mode (time consuming, but exact)
Superpose the maximum amplitudes of each mode (quick but conservative)
Superpose the square root of the sum of squares (good estimate for well-separated frequencies, but unsafe for closely spaced frequencies)
To superpose the individual modal responses manually, having calculated them by the energy method:
Assuming that the rise time tr is known (T = 2π/ω), it is possible to read the DAF from a standard graph. The static displacement can be calculated with

{\displaystyle u_{static}={\frac {F_{1,eq}}{k_{1,eq}}}}
. The dynamic displacement for the chosen mode and applied force can then be found from:
