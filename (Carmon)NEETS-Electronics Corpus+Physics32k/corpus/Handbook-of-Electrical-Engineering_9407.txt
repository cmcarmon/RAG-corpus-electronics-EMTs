Wireless Lans
Wireless LANs use a common radio channel to provide LAN connectivity without any physical wiring. Protocols
for wireless LANs are currently being standardized as the IEEE 802.11 standard. Although, one might consider
the use of a CSMA/CD protocol in this environment, stations using radio technology are unable to listen to
the same channel on which they are transmitting. Thus, it is not possible to implement the collision detection
(CD) part of CSMA/CD in a radio environment. Therefore, a modiÔ¨Åed protocol known as carrier sense multiple
access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) can be used.
