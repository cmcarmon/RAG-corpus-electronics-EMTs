If electrons are added to one end of a conductor 
and provision is made to take electrons from the other 
end, an electric current flows through the conductor. 
As free electrons move slowly through the conductor, 
they collide with atoms, knocking other electrons free. 
These new free electrons travel toward the positive end 
of the conductor and collide with other atoms. The
