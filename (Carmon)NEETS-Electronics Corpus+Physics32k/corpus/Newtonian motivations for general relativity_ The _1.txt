Consider the situation in which there are two particles in nearby circular polar orbits of the Earth at radius



r


{\displaystyle r}
and speed



v


{\displaystyle v}
. Since the orbits are circular, the gravitational force on the particles must equal the centripetal force,







v

r


=



G
M


r

2






{\displaystyle {v^{2} \over r}={GM \over r^{2}}}

where G is the gravitational constant and



M


{\displaystyle M}
is the mass of the earth.
The particles execute simple harmonic motion about the earth and with respect to each other. They are at their maximum distance from each other as they cross the equator. Their trajectories intersect at the poles.
From Newton's Law of Gravitation the separation vector

{\displaystyle \mathbf {h} }
can be shown to be given by the "geodesic equation"

{\displaystyle R={1 \over r^{2}}{v^{2} \over c^{2}}}
is the curvature of the trajectory and

{\displaystyle \tau =ct}
is the speed of light c times the time.
The curvature of the trajectory is generated by the mass of the earth

{\displaystyle R={GM \over {r^{3}}}}

In this example, the field equation is simply a statement of the Newtonian concept that centripetal force is equal to gravitational force for circular orbits. We refer to this expression as a field equation in order to highlight the similarities with the Einstein field equation. This equation is in a much different form than Gauss's law, which is the usual characterization of the field equation in Newtonian mechanics.
