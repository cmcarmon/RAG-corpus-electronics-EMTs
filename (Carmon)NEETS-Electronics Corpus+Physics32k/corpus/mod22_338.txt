You can use word processing software for any function that involves text: letters, memos, forms, 
reports, and so on. At a minimum, it includes routines for creating, editing, storing, retrieving, and 
printing text. Under the word processing software control, you generally enter the text on the keyboard 
and it is printed on a display screen as shown in figure 3-8. At that point, you may store it on disk or tape, 
print it on a printer, or change (edit) it. Using the edit functions you can add or delete words, characters, 
lines, sentences, or paragraphs. You can rearrange text; for example, move a paragraph or block of 
information to another place in the same document or even move it to a different document. Word 
processing is particularly useful for text documents that are repetitive or that require a lot of revisions. It 
saves a lot of rekeying.
