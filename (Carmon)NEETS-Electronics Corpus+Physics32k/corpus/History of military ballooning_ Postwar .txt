The US military developed high-altitude ballooning programs for nuclear detection and surveillance, such as Project Mogul (linked to the Roswell Incident), Project Genetrix and Project Moby Dick.
They also worked on the E77 balloon bomb, refining the principles of the Japanese fire balloon explosive-delivery system.
Aerostats have been used by US and coalition military forces in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
Balloons are used to gather intelligence and patrol above Israel’s borders. What really makes the balloons stand out is their ability to remain in the sky for long periods of time. A balloon doesn’t require constant refuelling like an aircraft does, and therefore is able to supply a constant source of intelligence on a target or a suspected area. If there’s an area not visible from the ground, these surveillance balloons can reach a height and cover ground that may be difficult to detect from below.
