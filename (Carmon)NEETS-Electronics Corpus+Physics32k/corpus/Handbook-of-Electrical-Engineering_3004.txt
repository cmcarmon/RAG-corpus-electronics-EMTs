The  Miller  factor,  M,  which  effectively  multiplies  Cm  in  the  expression  for  RCmCm,  increases  sharply  with  the
load  resistance,  RLT,  and  hence  with  the  gain  magnitude  of  the  common  emitter  ampliÔ¨Åer.  Note  that  in  the
limit of a large emitter degeneration resistance (which adds directly to Re), Eq. (28.30) reduces Eq. (28.32) to
the factor
