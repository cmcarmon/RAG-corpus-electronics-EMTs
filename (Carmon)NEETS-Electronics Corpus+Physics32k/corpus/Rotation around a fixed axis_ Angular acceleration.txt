A changing angular velocity indicates the presence of an angular acceleration in rigid body, typically measured in rad s−2. The average angular acceleration

over a time interval Δt is given by

{\displaystyle {\overline {\alpha }}={\frac {\Delta \omega }{\Delta t}}={\frac {\omega _{2}-\omega _{1}}{t_{2}-t_{1}}}.}

{\displaystyle \alpha (t)={\frac {d\omega }{dt}}={\frac {d^{2}\theta }{dt^{2}}}.}

Thus, the angular acceleration is the rate of change of the angular velocity, just as acceleration is the rate of change of velocity.
The translational acceleration of a point on the object rotating is given by




a

r
α
,



{\displaystyle a=r\alpha ,\!}

where r is the radius or distance from the axis of rotation. This is also the tangential component of acceleration: it is tangential to the direction of motion of the point. If this component is 0, the motion is uniform circular motion, and the velocity changes in direction only.
The radial acceleration (perpendicular to direction of motion) is given by

It is directed towards the center of the rotational motion, and is often called the centripetal acceleration.
The angular acceleration is caused by the torque, which can have a positive or negative value in accordance with the convention of positive and negative angular frequency. The ratio of torque and angular acceleration (how difficult it is to start, stop, or otherwise change rotation) is given by the moment of inertia:
