The SCP 800 Service database is administered by a single national service management system (SMS). The
SMS is an interactive operations support system that is used to process and update customer records. It is the
interface  between  the  customer  and  the  SCP.  It  translates  a  language  which  is  friendly  to  a  customer  into  a
language which is friendly to on-line, real-time databases. Along the way, it validates the customer input.
