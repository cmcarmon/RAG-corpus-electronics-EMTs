Errors of omission in requirements, speciﬁcations, and user documents are the most resistant to automatic
detection and elimination. Studies carried out on operating systems and large switching systems have revealed
that in spite of the enormous volume of software speciﬁcations (sometimes more than 100 English words per
source statement, with many diagrams and tables also occurring) more than 50% of the functionality in the
source code could not be found described in the speciﬁcations or requirements. Indeed, one of the unsolved
challenges of software engineering is to determine if it is even theoretically possible to fully specify large and
complex software systems. Assuming that full speciﬁcation is possible, several practical issues are also unknown:
(1) What combination of text, graphics, and other symbols is optimal for software speciﬁcations? (2) What is
the  optimum  volume  or  size  of  the  speciﬁcations  for  an  application  of  any  given  size?  (3) What  will  be  the
impact of multi-media software extensions on speciﬁcations, debugging, and testing?
