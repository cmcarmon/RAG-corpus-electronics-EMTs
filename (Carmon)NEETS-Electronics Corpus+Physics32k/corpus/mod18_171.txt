Air-search radar systems initially detect and determine the position, course, and speed of air targets
in a relatively large area. The maximum range of air-search radar can exceed 300 miles, and the bearing
coverage is a complete 360-degree circle. Air-search radar systems are usually divided into two
categories, based on the amount of position information supplied. As mentioned earlier in this chapter,
radar sets that provide only range and bearing information are referred to as two-dimensional, or 2D,
radars. Radar sets that supply range, bearing, and height are called three-dimensional, or 3D, radars. (3D
radar will be covered in the next section.) The coverage pattern of a typical 2D radar system is illustrated
in figure 1-25. A typical 2D air-search radar antenna is shown in figure 1-26.
