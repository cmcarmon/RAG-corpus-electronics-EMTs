the emitter diode is ON and the collector diode is OFF, and the active region results.
In this region of operation, as illustrated in the active region BJT model in Figure 7.50b,
the ideal diode between the base and emitter turns ON and appears as a short circuit.
The 0.6-V source models the corresponding 0.6-V diode drop. Observe further that
