Interviewing is a technique used for eliciting knowledge
from domain experts and design requirements. The basic
form involves free-form or unstructured question–answer ses-
sions between the domain expert and the knowledge engineer.
The major problem of this approach results from the inability
of domain experts to explicitly describe their reasoning process
and the biases involved in human reasoning. A more effective
form of interviewing is called structured interviewing, which
is goal-oriented and directed by a series of clearly stated goals.
Here, experts either ﬁll out a set of carefully designed ques-
tionnaire cards or answer questions carefully designed based
on an established domain model of the problem-solving pro-
cess. This technique reduces the interpretation problem inher-
ent in the unstructured interviewing as well as the distortion
caused by domain expert subjectivity.
