By far the most hazardous and complex application of the multimeter is in the measure-
ment of current. The reason for this is quite simple: in order for the meter to measure current,
the current to be measured must be forced to go through the meter. This means that the meter
must be made part of the current path of the circuit rather than just be connected off to the
side somewhere as is the case when measuring voltage. In order to make the meter part of
the current path of the circuit, the original circuit must be ”broken” and the meter connected
across the two points of the open break. To set the meter up for this, the selector switch must
point to either AC or DC ”A” and the red test lead must be plugged in the red socket marked
”A”. The following illustration shows a meter all ready to measure current and a circuit to be
tested:
