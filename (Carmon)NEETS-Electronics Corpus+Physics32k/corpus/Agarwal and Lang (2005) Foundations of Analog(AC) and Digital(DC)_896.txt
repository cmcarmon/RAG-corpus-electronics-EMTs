recall that it is not sufficient for a valid logic
device to have gain in the forbidden region. The transfer characteristic for input
values between 0 V and VIL must have an overall gain of less than unity. Accord-
ingly, notice that the transfer curve shown in Figure 6.50 attenuates voltages
that lie in the valid input low or valid input high intervals.
