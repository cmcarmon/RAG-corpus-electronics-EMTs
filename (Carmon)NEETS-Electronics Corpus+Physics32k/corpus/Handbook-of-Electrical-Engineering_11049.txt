Because  the  responses  are  in  digital  form,  they  can  be  written  out  in  hard-copy  format.  With  SSEPs,  the
response consists of many waves occurring at various times after the stimulus. To permit close examination of
the various waveforms, several displays are presented, each with a different time axis. Figure 113.23 presents a
sketch  of  the  neural  pathways  from  the  periphery  to  the  cortex,  showing  the  topographic  distribution  of
sensation along the cortex using the homunculus created by Penﬁeld, described in detail in 1968. Also shown
in Fig. 113.23 is a typical SSEP obtained by stimulating the median nerve with skin-surface electrodes connected
to an isolated (i.e., not grounded) stimulator output circuit. Note the remarkably low amplitude of the responses
that were obtained by averaging the response to 240 stimuli. Note also that the ﬁrst display showed the responses
from 0 to 50 ms and the second display presented the responses in the 0- to 400-ms interval.
