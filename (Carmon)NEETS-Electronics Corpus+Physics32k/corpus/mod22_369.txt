Since one numeric character can be represented and stored using only four bits (8-4-2-1), using an 
8-bit code allows the representation of two numeric characters (decimal digits) as illustrated in figure 4-6. 
Representing two numeric characters in one byte (eight bits) is referred to as packing or packed data. By 
packing data (numeric characters only) in this way, it allows us to conserve the amount of storage space 
required, and at the same time, increases processing speed.
