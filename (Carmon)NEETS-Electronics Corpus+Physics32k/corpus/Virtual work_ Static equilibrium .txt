Static equilibrium is a state in which the net force and net torque acted upon the system is zero. In other words, both linear momentum and angular momentum of the system are conserved. The principle of virtual work states that the virtual work of the applied forces is zero for all virtual movements of the system from static equilibrium. This principle can be generalised such that three dimensional rotations are included: the virtual work of the applied forces and applied moments is zero for all virtual movements of the system from static equilibrium. That is

{\displaystyle \delta W=\sum _{i=1}^{m}\mathbf {F} _{i}\cdot \delta \mathbf {r} _{i}+\sum _{j=1}^{n}\mathbf {M} _{j}\cdot \delta \mathbf {\phi } _{j}=0,}

where Fi , i = 1, 2, ..., m and Mj , j = 1, 2, ..., n are the applied forces and applied moments, respectively, and δri , i = 1, 2, ..., m and δφj , j = 1, 2, ..., n are the virtual displacements and virtual rotations, respectively.
Suppose the system consists of N particles, and it has f (f ≤ 6N) degrees of freedom. It is sufficient to use only f coordinates to give a complete description of the motion of the system, so f generalised coordinates qk , k = 1, 2, ..., f are defined such that the virtual movements can be expressed in terms of these generalised coordinates. That is,

The virtual work can then be reparametrised by the generalised coordinates:

The principle of virtual work requires that the virtual work done on a system by the forces Fi and moments Mj vanishes if it is in equilibrium. Therefore, the generalized forces Qk are zero, that is
