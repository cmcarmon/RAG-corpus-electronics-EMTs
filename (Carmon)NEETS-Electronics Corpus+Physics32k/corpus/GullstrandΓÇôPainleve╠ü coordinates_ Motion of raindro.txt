Define a raindrop as an object which plunges radially toward a black hole from rest at infinity. In Schwarzschild coordinates, the velocity of a raindrop is given by

{\displaystyle {\frac {dr}{dt}}=-\left(1-{\frac {2M}{r}}\right){\sqrt {\frac {2M}{r}}}.\,}

The speed tends to 0 as r approaches the event horizon. The raindrop appears to have slowed as it gets nearer the event horizon and halted at the event horizon as measured by the bookkeeper. Indeed, an observer outside the event horizon would see the raindrop plunges slower and slower. Its images infinitely redshifted and never make it through the event horizon. However, the bookkeeper does not physically measure the speed directly. He translates data relayed by the shell observer into Schwarzschild values and compute the speed. The result is only an accounting entry.
In GP coordinates, the velocity is given by

{\displaystyle {\frac {dr}{dt_{r}}}=\beta =-{\sqrt {\frac {2M}{r}}}.\,}


The speed of the raindrop is inversely proportional to the square root of the radius and equals the negative newtonian escape velocity. At places very far away from the black hole, the speed is extremely small. As the raindrop plunges toward the black hole, the speed increases. At the event horizon, the speed has the value 1. There is no discontinuity or singularity at the event horizon.
Inside the event horizon,



r
<

M




{\displaystyle r<2M\,\!}
the speed increases as the raindrop gets ever more closer to the singularity. Eventually, the speed becomes infinite at the singularity. As shown below the speed is always less than the speed of light. The results may not be correctly predicted by the equation at and very near the singularity since the true solution may be quite different when quantum mechanics is incorporated.
Despite the problem with the singularity, it's still possible to compute the travel time for the raindrop from horizon to the center of black hole mathematically.

Using this result for the speed of the raindrop we can find the proper time along the trajectory of the raindrop in terms of the time

{\displaystyle d\tau ^{2}=dt_{r}^{2}\left[1-{\frac {2M}{r}}+2{\sqrt {\frac {2M}{r}}}{\sqrt {\frac {2M}{r}}}-{\sqrt {\frac {2M}{r}}}^{2}\right]=dt_{r}^{2}}

I.e. along the rain drops trajectory, the elapse of time




t

r




{\displaystyle t_{r}}
is exactly the proper time along the trajectory. One could have defined the GP coordinates by this requirement, rather than by demanding that the spatial surfaces be flat.
A closely related set of coordinates is the Lemaître coordinates, in which the "radial" coordinate is chosen to be constant along the paths of the raindrops. Since r changes as the raindrops fall, this metric is time dependent while the GP metric is time independent.
The metric obtained if, in the above, we take the function f(r) to be the negative of what we choose above is also called the GP coordinate system. The only change in the metric is that cross term changes sign. This metric is regular for outgoing raindrops—i.e. particles which leave the black hole travelling outward with just escape velocity so that their speed at infinity is zero. In the usual GP coordinates, such particles cannot be described for r<2M. They have a zero value for

{\displaystyle {\frac {dr}{dt_{r}}}}
at r=2M. This is an indication that the Schwarzschild black hole has two horizons, a past horizon, and a future horizon. The Original form of the GP coordinates is regular across the future horizon (where particles fall into when they fall into a black hole) while the alternative negative version is regular across the past horizon (from which particles come out of the black hole if they do so).
The Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates are regular across both horizons at the expense of making the metric strongly dependent on the time coordinate.
