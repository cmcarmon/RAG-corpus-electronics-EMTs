The piezoelectric effect can be seen in a number of crystal substances. The most important of these 
are the minerals quartz and Rochelle salt. Although quartz does not exhibit the piezoelectric effect to the 
degree that Rochelle salt does, quartz is used for frequency control in oscillators because of its greater 
mechanical strength. Another mineral, tourmaline, is physically strong like quartz; but because it is more 
expensive, it is not used extensively as an fdd. This discussion will deal only with the quartz crystal.
