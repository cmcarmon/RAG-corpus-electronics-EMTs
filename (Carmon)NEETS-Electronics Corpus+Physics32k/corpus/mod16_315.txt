DAMPING.â€”This is accomplished in many D'Arsonval movements by means of the motion of the
aluminum bobbin on which the coil is wound. As the bobbin rotates in the magnetic field, an
electromotive force is induced into it as it cuts through the lines of force. Induced currents flow in the
bobbin in a direction opposite to the motion; this causes the bobbin to go beyond its final position only
once before stopping. The overall sensitivity of the meter can be increased by the use of a lightweight
rotating assembly (bobbin, coil, and pointer) and by the use of jewel bearings, as shown in figure 3-3.
