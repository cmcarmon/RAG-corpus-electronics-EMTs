on vacation) was able to build multiple circuit 
components out of a single, monolithic piece of 
germanium (a semiconductor material), and lay 
metal connectors in patterns on top of it. Kilby’s 
crude design was the first successful demon-
stration  of  the  integrated  circuit.  Six  months 
later, Robert Noyce of Fairchild Semiconductor 
(who also co‐founded Intel) invented his own 
version  of  the  IC,  which  solved  many  of  the 
practical  problems  inherent  in  Kilby’s  design 
and led to the mass production of ICs. Together, 
Kilby and Noyce are credited with the invention 
of the integrated circuit. (Kilby was awarded 
the Nobel Prize in Physics for his contributions 
to the invention of the integrated circuit — but 
not until 42 years later — and stated that had 
Noyce been alive when the Prize was awarded, 
he surely would have shared it.)
A lot has happened since 1958. All those smart, 
creative people continued to plug away at their 
work, and many more innovations took place. As 
a result, the electronics industry has exploded 
as  chip  densities  (a  measure  of  how  closely 
packed  the  transistors  are)  have  increased 
exponentially. Today, semiconductor manufac-
turers routinely carve millions of transistors into 
a piece of silicon smaller than the size of a dime, 
and microprocessors containing more than one 
billion transistors have been around since 2006.
