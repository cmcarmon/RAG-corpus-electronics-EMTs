An AM transmitter can be divided into two major sections according to the frequencies at which they 
operate, radio-frequency (rf) and audio-frequency (af) units. The rf unit is the section of the transmitter 
used to generate the rf carrier wave. As illustrated in figure 1-37, the carrier originates in the master 
oscillator stage where it is generated as a constant-amplitude, constant-frequency sine wave. The carrier is 
not of sufficient amplitude and must be amplified in one or more stages before it attains the high power 
required by the antenna. With the exception of the last stage, the amplifiers between the oscillator and the 
antenna are called INTERMEDIATE POWER AMPLIFIERS (ipa). The final stage, which connects to the 
antenna, is called the FINAL POWER AMPLIFIER (fpa).
