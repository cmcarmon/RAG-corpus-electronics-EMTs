Delta to Wye Conversion
Suppose  it  is  more  convenient  to  work  with  a  wye  network  in  a  place
where the circuit contains a delta conﬁguration. We superimpose a wye
network on the existing delta network and ﬁnd the equivalent resistances
in the wye network. To obtain the equivalent resistances in the wye net-
work,  we  compare  the  two  networks  and  make  sure  that  the  resistance
between each pair of nodes in the 
) network is the same as the
resistance between the same pair of nodes in the Y (or T) network. For
terminals 1 and 2 in Figs. 2.47 and 2.48, for example,
