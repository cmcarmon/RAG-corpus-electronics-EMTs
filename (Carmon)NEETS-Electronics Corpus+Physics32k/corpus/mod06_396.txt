When a CRT is broken, a large implosion usually occurs. Almost two tons of force hurl glass
fragments toward the center of the tube. At the same time, the electron gun is normally thrown forward
inside the tube. The face, because of its size, tends to move very slowly toward the center of the tube.
This presents one of the main hazards of a broken CRT. The electron gun passes through the center of the
tube with considerable force. It continues until it strikes the CRT face. The impact from the electron gun
normally breaks the CRT face into many small fragments, which are hurled outward. The face is coated
with a chemical coating that is extremely toxic. If you are unfortunate enough to experience an accidental
implosion of a CRT and are nicked by one of these fragments, seek immediate medical aid. As you can
see, improper handling of a CRT can be very hazardous to your health.
