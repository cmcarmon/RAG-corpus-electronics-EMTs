In general, the poles (or zeros) can be real or can appear in
complex conjugate pairs. We can draw them in the complex
plane, and we can use crosses to mark the poles and use small
circles to mark the zeros. Figure 4.10 shows the pole-zero plot
of a network with one real and two complex conjugate poles
and with two purely imaginary zeros.
