The coaxial cable essentially acts as a private radio channel for the users. An interesting protocol called carrier
sense multiple-access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) is used in such a network. Each station constantly
monitors  the  cable  and  can  detect  when  it  is  idle  (no  user  transmitting),  when  one  user  is  transmitting
(successfully), or when more than one user is simultaneously transmitting (resulting in an unsuccessful collision
on the channel). The cable basically acts as a broadcast bus. Any station can transmit on the cable if the station
detects it to be idle. Once a station transmits, other stations will not interrupt the transmission. As there is no
central control in the network, occasionally two or more stations may attempt to transmit at about the same
