An oscilloscope is a piece of test equipment that displays how a voltage varies 
with time as a trace across a cathode‐ray tube (CRT) or other display that 
contains a calibrated grid. You use a scope to visualize what is happening to 
rapidly varying voltages in your circuits. If you’re interested in building audio 
amplifiers and other circuits that have time‐varying signals, such as sound, 
an oscilloscope can come in handy and help you understand circuit opera­
tion and pinpoint errors. A good scope costs a few hundred dollars but you 
may be able to find some great deals on eBay or Craigslist.
