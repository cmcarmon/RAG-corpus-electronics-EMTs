Many of the failure mechanisms, which are activated by prolonged operation of electronic components, are
related  to  the  local  temperature  and/or  temperature  gradients,  as  well  as  the  thermal  history  of  the  package

[Pecht et al.,
and operating temperature. This dependence, illustrated in Fig. 33.1, is exponential in nature and commonly
represented  in  the  form  of  an Arrhenius  relation,  with  unique,  empirically  determined  coefﬁcients  for  each
