The source radiance is normally stated as luminance in candle per square centimeter (1 lumen per steradian
per square centimeter) or radiance in watts per square centimeter per steradian per nanometer. The lumen is
deﬁned as the luminous ﬂux emitted into a solid angle of a steradian by a point source of intensity 1/60th that
of a 1-cm2 blackbody source held at 2042 K temperature (molten platinum).
