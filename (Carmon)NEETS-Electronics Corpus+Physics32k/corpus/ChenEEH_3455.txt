differential relaying has been a powerful approach in the past, it
has some inherent limitations that pose difÔ¨Åculties for special
applications or practical design considerations. Further discus-
sion concentrates on the mentioned limitations and their impact
on the current differential approaches. The other relaying prin-
ciples applied for protecting power transformers are not dis-
cussed here. Further details can be found in references (Horowitz
and Phadke, 1992; Blackburn, 1998; Ungrad et al., 1995).
