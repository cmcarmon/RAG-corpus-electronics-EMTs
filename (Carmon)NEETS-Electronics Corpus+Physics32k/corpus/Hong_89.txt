Field-effect  transistors  are  far  more  ubiquitous  than  BJTs  in  todayâ€™s  integrated 
electronic circuits. The most common FET is the metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect 
transistor  (MOSFET),  millions  of  which  are  found  in  each  computer  CPU.    Similar  to 
NPN and PNP type BJTs, there are also N-channel and P-channel MOSFETs. A circuit 
containing both N- and P-type MOSFETs is called a complementary-MOS circuit, giving 
the widely-used acronym CMOS.
