The mercuric-oxide zinc cell (mercury cell) is a primary cell that was developed during World War 
II. Two important assets of the mercury cell are its ability to produce current for a long period of time and 
a long shelf life when compared to the dry cell shown in figure 2-4. The mercury cell also has a very 
stable output voltage and is a power source that can be made in a small physical size.
