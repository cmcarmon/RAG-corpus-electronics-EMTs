In general the demagnetizing field is a function of position H(r). It is derived from the magnetostatic equations for a body with no electric currents. These are Ampère's law

and Gauss's law

The magnetic field and flux density are related by

where




μ

{\displaystyle \mu _{0}}
is the permeability of vacuum and M is the magnetisation.
