Given the more or less straight-line behavior of the iDS versus vDS curves
to the left and to the right of the dashed line in Figure 7.12,
it is natural
to seek a piecewise-linear model for the MOSFET. Recall from Section 4.4,
piecewise-linear modeling represents nonlinear v i characteristics by a succes-
sion of straight-line segments, and makes calculations within each straight-line
segment using linear analysis tools. Figure 7.13 shows our choice of straight-line
segments that model the actual MOSFET characteristics.
To the right of the vDS = vGS âˆ’ VT boundary (represented by the dashed
line in Figure 7.13) we have the saturation region, in which we use a set of
horizontal straight-line segments (one for each value of vGS) to represent the
actual MOSFET characteristics. The straight-line segments representing the
model are shown as thick grey lines. The circuit interpretation of each of
the horizontal straight-line segments is a current source. Furthermore, because
