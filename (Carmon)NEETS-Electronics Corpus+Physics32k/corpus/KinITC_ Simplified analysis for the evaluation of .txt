The kinetics of the bimolecular reaction A + B ↔ C is governed by the two parameters kon and koff which leads to:
d[C] /dt = kon [A] [B] - koff [C] (5)
This equation may be complemented with two conservation equations: [A] +[C] = [A]0 and [B] +[C] = [B]0 , [A]0 and [B]0 being the total concentrations of the compounds A and B at the beginning of the reaction. These two concentrations [A]0 and [B]0 vary during each injection of compound B (which typically lasts more than 0.5 s and less than 3 to 4 s), but are constant between two successive injections (separated by much longer times). We consider here a simplified situation where the short injection time is neglected, which means that [A]0 and [B]0 are constant during each titration step. In addition, the problem of the finite response time of the instrument is also neglected. It is explained in the following how these limitations can be suppressed. Within this simplified frame, an analytical solution to equation (5) can be obtained. This is illustrated with Fig. 1 highlighting two simulations with two different values of kon.

In Fig. 1, each step following the injection of 1.3 µl of compound B lasts 80 s. The vertical bars mark the theoretical value of the time needed to reach equilibrium at each titration step. It is seen that with the higher kon value of 15000 M-1 s-1 (upper figure) the time interval of 80 s is always sufficient for returning to equilibrium, whereas with the lower kon value of 7940 M-1 s-1, it becomes too short (red bars) for some injections. The thickest and longest bar marks mid-titration, that is the titration step closest to a unit stoichiometry ([A] = [B]). It can be shown that this corresponds to the step with the slowest return to equilibrium.
