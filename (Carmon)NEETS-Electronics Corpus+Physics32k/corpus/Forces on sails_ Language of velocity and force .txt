To understand forces and velocities, discussed here, one must understand what is meant by a "vector" and a "scalar." Velocity (V), denoted as boldface in this article, is an example of a vector, because it implies both direction and speed. The corresponding speed (V ), denoted as italics in this article is a scalar value. Likewise, a force vector, F, denotes direction and strength, whereas its corresponding scalar (F ) denotes strength alone. Graphically, each vector is represented with an arrow that shows direction and a length that shows speed or strength. Vectors of consistent units (e.g. V in m/s or F in N) may be added and subtracted, graphically, by positioning tips and tails of the arrows, representing the input variables and drawing the resulting derived vector.
