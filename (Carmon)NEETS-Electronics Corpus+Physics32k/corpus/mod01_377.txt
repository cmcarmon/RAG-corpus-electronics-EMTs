In many cases, a battery-powered device may require more electrical energy than one cell can 
provide. The device may require either a higher voltage or more current, and in some cases both. Under 
such conditions it is necessary to combine, or interconnect, a sufficient number of cells to meet the higher 
requirements. Cells connected in SERIES provide a higher voltage, while cells connected in PARALLEL 
provide a higher current capacity. To provide adequate power when both voltage and current 
requirements are greater than the capacity of one cell, a combination SERIES-PARALLEL network of 
cells must be used.
