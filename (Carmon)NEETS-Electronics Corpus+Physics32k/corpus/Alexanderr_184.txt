Solution:
We Ô¨Årst transform the current and voltage sources to obtain the circuit
in  Fig.  4.18(a).  Combining  the 
resistors  in  series  and
transforming  the  12-V voltage  source  gives  us  Fig.  4.18(b).  We  now
combine  the 
.  We  also
combine  the  2-A and  4-A current  sources  to  get  a  2-A source.  Thus,
by repeatedly applying source transformations, we obtain the circuit in
Fig. 4.18(c).
