The basic structure of an optical fiber consists of three parts; the core, the cladding, and the coating
or buffer. The basic structure of an optical fiber is shown in figure 2-9. The core is a cylindrical rod of
dielectric material. Dielectric material conducts no electricity. Light propagates mainly along the core of
the fiber. The core is generally made of glass. The core is described as having a radius of (a) and an index
of refraction n1. The core is surrounded by a layer of material called the cladding. Even though light will
propagate along the fiber core without the layer of cladding material, the cladding does perform some
necessary functions.
