If a time-invariant system is nonlinear, then the Lyapunov method is the most popular choice for stability
analysis.  If  the  system  is  linear,  then  the  direct  application  of  Theorem  12.5  is  more  attractive,  since  the
eigenvalues of the coefÔ¨Åcient matrix A can be obtained by standard methods. In addition, several conditions
are known from the literature that guarantee the asymptotic stability of time-invariant discrete and continuous
systems even without computing the eigenvalues. For examining asymptotic stability, linearization is an alternative
approach to the Lyapunov method as is shown here. Consider the time-invariant continuous and discrete systems
