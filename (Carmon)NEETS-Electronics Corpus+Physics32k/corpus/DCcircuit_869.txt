Tachogenerators can also indicate the direction of rotation by the polarity of the output
voltage. When a permanent-magnet style DC generatorâ€™s rotational direction is reversed, the
polarity of its output voltage will switch. In measurement and control systems where direc-
tional indication is needed, tachogenerators provide an easy way to determine that.
