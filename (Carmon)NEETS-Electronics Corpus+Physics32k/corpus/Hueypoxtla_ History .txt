On December 4, 2013, cobalt-60 from a truck theft two days before 2 km away was recovered there, as well as the heavy truck itself; the decommissioned cobalt therapy machine had been en route to proper disposal. Federal police and military units established an armed cordon approximately 50 meters around the radiation source in the empty lot where it had been abandoned. Six people showing signs of possible radiation exposure from the orphan source were later detained. It is not known whether the thieves wanted the truck (which included a crane), the cobalt-60, or both.
