The amount of voltage induced in the inductor de-
pends on the rate of change of the magnetic field. The 
faster the magnetic field expands and collapses, the 
greater the induced voltage. The total effective volt-
age across the inductor is the difference between the 
applied voltage and the induced voltage. The induced 
voltage is always less than the applied voltage.
