Starting from scale relativity, it is possible to derive the fundamental "postulates" of quantum mechanics. More specifically, building on the result of the key theorem showing that a space which is continuous and non-differentiable is necessarily fractal (see section 2.4), Schrödinger's equation, Born's and von Neumann's postulate are derived.
To derive Schrödinger's equation, Nottale started with Newton's second law of motion, and used the result of the key theorem. Many subsequent works then confirmed the derivation.
Actually, the Schrödinger equation derived becomes generalized in scale relativity, and opens the way to a macroscopic quantum mechanics (see below for validated empirical predictions in astrophysics). This may also help to better understand macroscopic quantum phenomena in the future.
Reasoning about fractal geodesics and non-differentiability, it is also possible to derive von Neumann's postulate and Born's postulate.
With the hypothesis of a fractal space-time, the Klein-Gordon, and the Dirac equation can then be derived.
The significance of these fundamental results is immense, as the foundations of quantum mechanics which were up to now axiomatic, are now logically derived from more primary relativity theory principles and methods.
