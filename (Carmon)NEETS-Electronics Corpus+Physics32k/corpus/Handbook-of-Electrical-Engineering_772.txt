For a balanced system, the equivalent load conﬁguration
may be either wye or delta. If both of these conﬁgurations
are connected at only three terminals, it would be very
advantageous  if  an  equivalence  could  be  established
between  them.  It  is,  in  fact,  possible  characteristics  are
the  same.  Consider,  for  example,  the  two  networks
shown in Fig. 9.5. For these two networks to be equiva-
lent  at  each  corresponding  pair  of  terminals  it  is  necessary  that  the  input  impedances  at  the  corresponding
terminals be equal, for example, if at terminals a and b, with c open-circuited, the impedance is the same for
both conﬁgurations. Equating the impedances at each port yields
