At this point, we take a moment to make a couple of other helpful obser-
vations. Sometimes, we desire the response related to the capacitor current.
The responses related to the capacitor current can be easily determined from
the voltage response and the capacitor element law. However, the current
response can also be directly obtained by using the same type of insight that we
used to obtain the voltage response. Here, we would seek the initial and final
values of the current. In our example, the final value of the capacitor current
