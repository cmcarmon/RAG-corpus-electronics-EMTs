Radio transmission is inherently a bandpass process with a limited bandwidth B nominally
centered at the carrier frequency fc. The fractional bandwidth B/fc is a key design factor with
a general range of 1/100 ≤ B/fc ≤ 1/10. It is obvious then that large signal bandwidths
require high carrier frequencies to satisfy fc ≥ 10B. You can reason why television signals
are transmitted at fc of 100 MHz, whereas AM radio signals are transmitted at fc of 1 MHz.
Since optical communication systems offer tremendous bandwidth potential on the order of 1012
Hz, and a corresponding high information rate, they have become topics of current research
interest.
