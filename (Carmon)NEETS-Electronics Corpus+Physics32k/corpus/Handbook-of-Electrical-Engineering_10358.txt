availability  of  voice  connectivity.  To  support  voice  over  data VSATs,  an  audio  encoder  is  used  to  accept  an
analog voice signal, digitize and packetize it, and format it for transmission through the VSAT data network.
A voice port may either be implemented as part of a “baseline” data/voice card or as an add-on stand-alone box.
The integrated data/voice system employs a TDM outbound carrier and shared inbound carriers for data
and voice transmission. Two types of voice network communications alternatives may be implemented for voice
channel  communications:  a  poll/response  access  scheme  and  a  reservation  TDMA  access  scheme.  With  the
poll/response  access  scheme,  the  hub  polls  the  VSAT  voice  ports  on  a  cyclic  basis.  The  VSATs  return  their
responses in the form of call requests or status updates. The number of sites in the voice network determines
the rate at which VSATs are polled. Thus, this scheme is suitable for a small network. Excessive polling delays
will be encountered for a network with a relatively large number of remotes.
