A star topology seems most attractive for gigabit-per-sec-
ond multiple-access photonic networks [Kaminow, 1989], as
shown in Fig. 71.11. Each station has its own transmitter and
receiver. For optical TDM, the connectivity can be provided
by an N · N electrooptic switch and suitable controller, and
for optical FDM, the connectivity is provided by a passive N
· N star coupler. Electrooptic N · N switches based on inte-
grated titanium-diffused lithium niobate waveguide elements
[Korotky and Alferness, 1988] have been demonstrated with
N  =  16  and  operating  at  B  =  2.5  Gb/s  for  each  input.  The
switch connections can be rearranged in a few nanoseconds.
It is estimated that such switches could be interconnected to
provide  N  =  256.  Unlike  electronic  switches,  electrooptic
switches are transparent to the bit rate, i.e., they can connect
any  bit  stream  independent  of  B.  The  problems  of  suitable
multiple-access protocols and controls have not yet been fully
addressed.
