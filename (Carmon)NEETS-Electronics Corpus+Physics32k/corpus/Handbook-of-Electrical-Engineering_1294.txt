When using the algebraic characteristics of the composite matrix to form a rational model of empirical data
pairs,  there  is  much  to  be  gained  by  using  an  over-ordered  model.  By  taking  an  over-ordered  approach,  the
recursive model parameters are made less sensitive to quirks in the empirical data. A more detailed explanation
of this concept is found in Cadzow and Solomon [1988].
