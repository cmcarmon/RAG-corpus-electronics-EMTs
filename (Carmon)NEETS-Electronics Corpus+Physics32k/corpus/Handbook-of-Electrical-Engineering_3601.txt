This  section  focuses  on  the  basic  electromagnetic  ﬁeld  concepts,  wave  propagation,  devices,  circuits,  and
other  applications.  The  electric  ﬁelds  which  are  produced  by  stationary  or  moving  charges  are  described  in
Chapter 35. Maxwell’s equations and their solutions under different boundary conditions help in determining
the electric ﬁeld components and resulting effects. The next chapter describes the magnetic ﬁelds and magnetic
effects due to moving charges or current. These magnetic ﬁelds are also governed by Maxwell’s equations and
their solutions are obtained for different boundary conditions. Particular magnetic materials with an assemblage
of  ferromagnetic  particles  in  a  nonferromagnetic  matrix  are  useful  as  audio  or  video  tapes.  This  subject  is
investigated in Chapter 36 to provide insight into the recording mechanism of the music we hear all the time.
The time-varying electromagnetic ﬁeld propagation in space or in transmission lines provides the concept of
radio communication as discussed in Chapter 37. Another article in the chapter analyzes the transmission of
energy  through  waveguides  and  microstriplines.  Microstriplines  have  become  the  basic  building  blocks  for
microwave integrated circuits (MICS). For the propagation of electromagnetic ﬁelds in space, properly matched
antennas between generator and space are required, as described in Chapter 38. Wire and aperture antennas
are also described.
