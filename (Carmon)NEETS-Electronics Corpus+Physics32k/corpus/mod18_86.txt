Radar accuracy is a measure of the ability of a radar system to determine the correct range, bearing,
and, in some cases, height of an object. The degree of accuracy is primarily determined by the resolution
of the radar system. Some additional factors affecting accuracy are pulse shape and atmospheric
conditions.
