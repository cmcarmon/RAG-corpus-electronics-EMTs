PCM is a technique where an analog signal is sampled, quantized, and then encoded as a digital word. The
PCM IC can include successive approximation techniques or other techniques to accomplish the PCM encoding.

In addition, the PCM codec may employ nonlinear data compression techniques, such as 
necessary to minimize the number of bits in the output digital code. Companding is a logarithmic technique
used to compress a code to fewer bits before transmission. The inverse logarithmic function is then used to
expand the code to its original number of bits before converting it to the analog signal. Companding is typically
used in telecommunications transmission systems to minimize data transmission rates without degrading the
resolution of low-amplitude signals. Two standardized companding techniques are used extensively: A-law and

throughout the entire analog range.
