Instrumentation and control systems 
 
Figure  16.1  shows 
the  arrangement  of  an 
instrumentation system. The physical quantity to be 
measured (e.g. temperature) acts upon a sensor that 
produces an electrical output signal. This signal is 
an electrical analogue of the physical input but note 
that there may not be a linear  relationship between 
the  physical  quantity  and  its  electrical  equivalent. 
Because  of  this  and  since  the  output  produced  by 
the  sensor  may  be  small  or  may  suffer  from  the 
presence  of  noise  (i.e.  unwanted  signals)  further 
signal  conditioning  will  be  required  before  the 
signal  will  be  at  an  acceptable  level  and  in  an 
acceptable form for signal processing, display and
