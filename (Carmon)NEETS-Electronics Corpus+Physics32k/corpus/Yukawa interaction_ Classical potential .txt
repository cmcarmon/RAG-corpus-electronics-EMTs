If two fermions interact through a Yukawa interaction with Yukawa particle mass



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }
, the potential between the two particles, known as the Yukawa potential, will be:

{\displaystyle V(r)=-{\frac {g^{2}}{4\pi }}{\frac {1}{r}}e^{-\mu r}}

which is the same as a Coulomb potential except for the sign and the exponential factor. The sign will make the interaction attractive between all particles (the electromagnetic interaction is repulsive for same electrical charge sign particles). This is explained by the fact that the Yukawa particle has spin zero and even spin always results in an attractive potential. The negative sign of the exponential gives the interaction an effectively finite range, so that particles at great distances will hardly interact any longer (interaction forces drop off exponentially with increasing separation).
