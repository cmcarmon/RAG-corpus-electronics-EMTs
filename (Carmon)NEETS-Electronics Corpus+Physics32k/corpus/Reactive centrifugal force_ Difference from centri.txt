Any force directed away from a center can be called "centrifugal". Centrifugal simply means "directed outward from the center". Similarly, centripetal means "directed toward the center". The "reactive centrifugal force" discussed in this article is not the same thing as the centrifugal pseudoforce, which is usually what's meant by the term "centrifugal force".
Reactive centrifugal force, being one-half of the reaction pair together with centripetal force, is a concept which applies in any reference frame. This distinguishes it from the inertial or fictitious centrifugal force, which appears only in rotating frames.
