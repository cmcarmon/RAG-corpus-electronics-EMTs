Close inspection of the waveform of vIN2 shown in Figure 12.3 reveals
that both the correct operation and the speed of the cascaded inverters depends
on the second-order behavior of the capacitor-inductor-resistor circuit formed
between the two inverters. The oscillatory character of the waveform of vIN2
following each rising and falling transition is referred to as ringing. As can be
seen in Figure 12.3, the output of the first inverter as received by the second
inverter is valid only after the ringing transitions settle above VOH for a rising
transition, and below VOL for a falling transition. Waiting for the ringing to settle
within the output thresholds results in the signal propagation delays tpd,1→0
and tpd,0→1. This too is analyzed in more detail in Section 12.5.
