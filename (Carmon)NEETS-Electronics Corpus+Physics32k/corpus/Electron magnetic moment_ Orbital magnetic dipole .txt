The revolution of an electron around an axis through another object, such as the nucleus, gives rise to the orbital magnetic dipole moment. Suppose that the angular momentum for the orbital motion is L. Then the orbital magnetic dipole moment is

{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\mu }}_{L}=-g_{\text{L}}\mu _{\text{B}}{\frac {\mathbf {L} }{\hbar }}.}

Here gL is the electron orbital g-factor and μB is the Bohr magneton. The value of gL is exactly equal to one, by a quantum-mechanical argument analogous to the derivation of the classical gyromagnetic ratio
