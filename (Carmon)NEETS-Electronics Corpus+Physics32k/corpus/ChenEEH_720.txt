Cost Model for High-Speed Memory Architectures
New memory architectures are developed to provide a higher
basic access speed. To have a better understanding, we ﬁrst
brieﬂy explain a model reﬂecting the virtual operation of a
modern SDRAM5 (see Figure 2.14). We abstract the physical
implementation details that we cannot inﬂuence (e.g., the
bitwidth, the circuits used, the ﬂoor-plan, and the memory
plane organization). Some of these have already been men-
tioned in Subsection 2.3.1. The SDRAM consists of several
banks that are accessed in an interleaved fashion to sustain a
high throughput (pipelining principle). Every bank typically
has several planes that can be activated separately. The virtual
plane is deﬁned as the total storage matrix entity that is
activated (and consumes energy) when a particular memory
access is performed. The planes contain a page that is copied to
a local latch register for fast access.
