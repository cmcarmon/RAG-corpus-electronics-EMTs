This assumption implies that the afﬁne terms in the plant
dynamics have a bounded gain and a bounded rate of change.
Since the functions cc
i are assumed continuous, they are there-
fore bounded in Sx. Similarly, note that even though the term
j _XX ij may not necessarily be globally bounded, it will have a
constant bound in Sx due to the continuity assumptions we
make. Therefore, the assumption of equation 12.2 will always be
satisﬁed in Sxn . Moreover, in the simplest of cases, the ﬁrst part
of assumption of equation 12.2 is satisﬁed globally when the
functions c j
