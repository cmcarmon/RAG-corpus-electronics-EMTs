and footprints. The form should also allow convenient removal
of heat, sufÔ¨Åcient mechanical strength to withstand forces
generated during system faults, acceptable noise characteris-
tics, and an electrical insulation system that meets both the
system steady-state and transient requirements. There are two
common transformer structures in use today for power trans-
formers. When the magnetic circuit is encircled by two or
more windings, the transformer is referred to as a core-type
transformer. When the primary and secondary windings are
encircled by the magnetic material, the transformer is referred
to as a shell-type transformer. Refer to Figure 3.6 for an
illustration of each.
