For a number of experimental configurations, there are explicit expressions relating the shifts of frequency and bandwidth to the sample properties. The assumptions underlying the equations are the following:
The resonator and all cover layers are laterally homogeneous and infinite.
The distortion of the crystal is given by a transverse plane wave with the wave-vector perpendicular to the surface normal (thickness-shear mode). There are neither compressional waves nor flexural contributions to the displacement pattern. There are no nodal lines in the plane of the resonator.
All stresses are proportional to strain. Linear viscoelasticity holds.
Piezoelectric stiffening may be ignored.
