Let



G


{\displaystyle G}
be a locally compact group and



Γ


{\displaystyle \Gamma }
a discrete subgroup (this means that there exists a neighbourhood



U


{\displaystyle U}
of the identity element




e

G




{\displaystyle e_{G}}
of



G


{\displaystyle G}
such that



Γ
∩
U
=
{

e

G


}


{\displaystyle \Gamma \cap U=\{e_{G}\}}
). Then



Γ


{\displaystyle \Gamma }
is called a lattice in



G


{\displaystyle G}
if in addition there exists a Borel measure



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }
on the quotient space



G

/

Γ


{\displaystyle G/\Gamma }
which is finite (i.e.



μ
(
G

/

Γ
)
<
+
∞


{\displaystyle \mu (G/\Gamma )<+\infty }
) and



G


{\displaystyle G}
-invariant (meaning that for any



g
∈
G


{\displaystyle g\in G}
and any open subset



W
⊂
G

/

Γ


{\displaystyle W\subset G/\Gamma }
the equality



μ
(
g
W
)
=
μ
(
W
)


{\displaystyle \mu (gW)=\mu (W)}
is satisifed).
A slightly more sophisticated formulation is as follows: suppose in addition that



G


{\displaystyle G}
is unimodular, then since



Γ


{\displaystyle \Gamma }
is discrete it is also unimodular and by general theorems there exists a unique



G


{\displaystyle G}
-invariant Borel measure on



G

/

Γ


{\displaystyle G/\Gamma }
up to scaling. Then



Γ


{\displaystyle \Gamma }
is a lattice if and only if this measure is finite.
In the case of discrete subgroups this invariant measure coincides locally with the Haar measure and hence a discrete subgroup in a locally compact group



G


{\displaystyle G}
being a lattice is equivalent to it having a fundamental domain (for the action on



G


{\displaystyle G}
by left-translations) of finite volume for the Haar measure.
A lattice



Γ
⊂
G


{\displaystyle \Gamma \subset G}
is called uniform when the quotient space



G

/

Γ


{\displaystyle G/\Gamma }
is compact (and non-uniform otherwise). Equivalently a discrete subgroup



Γ
⊂
G


{\displaystyle \Gamma \subset G}
is a uniform lattice if and only if there exists a compact subset



C
⊂
G


{\displaystyle C\subset G}
with



G
=
⋃





γ
∈
Γ



C
γ


{\displaystyle G=\bigcup {}_{\gamma \in \Gamma }\,C\gamma }
. Note that if



Γ


{\displaystyle \Gamma }
is any discrete subgroup in



G


{\displaystyle G}
such that



G

/

Γ


{\displaystyle G/\Gamma }
is compact then



Γ


{\displaystyle \Gamma }
is automatically a lattice in



G


{\displaystyle G}
.
