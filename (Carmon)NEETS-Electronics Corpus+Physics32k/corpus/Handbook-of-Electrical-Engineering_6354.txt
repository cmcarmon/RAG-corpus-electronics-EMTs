Following the source encoder, the resulting serial digital signal is applied to the input of the channel encoder,
a device that modulates the transmitted RF wave with the reduced-rate audio information. Auxiliary serial data,
such as program information and/or receiver control functions, also can be input to the channel encoder for
simultaneous transmission.
