electromagnetic wavefront. The path followed by electromagnetic energy in the atmosphere, whether
direct or reflected, usually is slightly curved; and the speed is affected by temperature, atmospheric
pressure, and the amount of water vapor present in the atmosphere, which all affect the refractive index.
As altitude increases, the combined effects of these influences, under normal atmospheric conditions,
cause a small, uniform increase in signal speed. This increase in speed causes the travel path to curve
slightly downward, as shown in figure 1-13. The downward curve extends the radar horizon beyond a line
tangent to the earth, as illustrated in figure 1-14.
