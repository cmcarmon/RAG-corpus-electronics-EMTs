HRS antennas of type HRS 1/1/z are undefined as such (such a thing would consist of just a single dipole).
HRS antennas of type HRS 1/2/z and 2/1/z exist, but see little practical use in shortwave broadcasting. VHF and UHF repeaters for FM radio or television in the UK quite often employ a pair of horizontal dipoles (or short yagis) one above the other (i.e. HRS 1/2/z) to concentrate transmission power in the horizontal plane.
The Russian Duga-3 Over The Horizon Radar may have used an antenna of type HRS 32/16/0.75 (not verified, estimated), with potential directional ERP in the gigawatt range.
