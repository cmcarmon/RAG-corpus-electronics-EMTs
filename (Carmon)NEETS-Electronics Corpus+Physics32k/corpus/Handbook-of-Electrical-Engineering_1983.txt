One of the ﬁrst-generation digital signal processors is the (N-MOS technology) TMS32010, introduced by
Texas  Instruments  in  1982.  This  ﬁrst-generation  ﬁxed-point  processor  is  based  on  the  Harvard  architecture,
with a fast on-chip hardware multiplier/accumulator, and with data and instructions in separate memory spaces,
allowing for concurrent accesses. This type of pipelining feature enables the processor to execute one instruction
while fetching at the same time the next instruction. Other features include 144 (16-bit) words of on-chip data
RAM and a 16-bit by 16-bit multiply operation in one instruction cycle time of 200 ns. Since many instructions
can be executed in one single cycle, the TMS32010 is capable of executing 5 million instructions per second
(MIPS).  Major  drawbacks  of  this  ﬁrst-generation  processor  are  its  limited  on-chip  memory  size  and  much
slower execution time for accessing external memory. Improved versions of this ﬁrst-generation processor are
now available in C-MOS technology, with a faster instruction cycle time of 160 ns.
