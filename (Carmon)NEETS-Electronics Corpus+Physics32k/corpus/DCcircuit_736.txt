When there is inﬁnite resistance (no continuity between test leads), there is zero current
through the meter movement, and the needle points toward the far left of the scale. In this
regard, the ohmmeter indication is ”backwards” because maximum indication (inﬁnity) is on
the left of the scale, while voltage and current meters have zero at the left of their scales.
