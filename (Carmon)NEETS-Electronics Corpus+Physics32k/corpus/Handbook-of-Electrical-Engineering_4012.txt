The current gain for a bipolar transistor is shown in Fig. 39.15. The current gains of the transistor operated
in  the  CE  and  CB  conﬁgurations  are  called b  and a,  respectively. As  indicated  in  the  ﬁgure,  the  CE  current
gain  b  is  much  larger  than  the  CB  current  gain  a,  which  is  limited  to  values  less  than  unity.  For  modern
microwave transistors a
