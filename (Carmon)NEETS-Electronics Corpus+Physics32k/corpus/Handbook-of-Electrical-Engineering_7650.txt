A  differential  pnpn  device  made  by  simply  connecting  two  pnpn  devices  in
parallel and connecting that combination in series with a resistive load is illus-
trated  in  Fig. 79.29.  The  operation  of  the  device  can  be  described  as  follows.
When the device is biased below threshold, that is, with the device unilluminated,
both optical switches are “off.” When the device is illuminated, the one with the
highest power is switched “on.” The increase in current leads to a voltage drop
across the resistor which in turn leads to a lowering of the voltage across both
optical switches. Therefore, the one with the lower input cannot be switched “on.”
Unless  both  inputs  were  illuminated  with  precisely  the  same  power  and  both
devices had identical characteristics (both of these are impossible), only one of
the two optical switches will emit light.
