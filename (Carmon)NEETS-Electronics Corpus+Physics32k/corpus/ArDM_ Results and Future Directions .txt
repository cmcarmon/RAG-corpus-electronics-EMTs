Despite studying inherently 'dark' matter, the future seems bright for dark matter detector development. The "Dark Side Program" is a consortium that has conducted and continues to develop new experiments based on condensed atmospheric argon (LAr), instead of xenon, liquid. One recent Dark Side apparatus, the Dark Side-50 (DS-50), employs a method known as "two-phase liquid argon time projection chambers (LAr TPCs)," which allows for three-dimensional determination of collision event positions created by the electrolumnescence created by argon collisions with dark matter particles. The Dark Side program released its first results on its findings in 2015, so far being the most sensitive results for argon-based dark matter detection. LAr-based methods used for future apparatuses present an alternative to xenon-based detectors and could potentially lead to new, more sensitive multi-ton detectors in the near future.
