Chaotic Digital Modulation Schemes
Chaos Shift Keying CSK
In Chaos Shift Keying (CSK), each symbol is represented by a weighted sum of chaotic basis functions gj(t). A
binary CSK transmitter is shown in Fig. 5.26. The sample function si(t) is g1(t) or g2(t), depending on whether
symbol “1” or “0” is to be transmitted.
