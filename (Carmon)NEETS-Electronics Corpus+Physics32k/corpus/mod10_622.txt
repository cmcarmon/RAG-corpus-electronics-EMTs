When vertical polarization is used, less interference is produced or picked up because of strong vhf 
and uhf broadcast transmissions (television and fm). This is because vhf and uhf transmissions use 
horizontal polarization. This factor is important when an antenna must be located in an urban area having 
several television and fm broadcast stations.
