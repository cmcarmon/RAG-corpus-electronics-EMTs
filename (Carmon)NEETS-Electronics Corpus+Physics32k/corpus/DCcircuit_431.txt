These display modes tell the calculator how to represent any number on the numerical
readout. The actual value of the number is not affected in any way by the choice of display
modes – only how the number appears to the calculator user. Likewise, the procedure for en-
tering numbers into the calculator does not change with different display modes either. Powers
of ten are usually represented by a pair of digits in the upper-right hand corner of the display,
and are visible only in the ”scientiﬁc” and ”engineering” modes.
