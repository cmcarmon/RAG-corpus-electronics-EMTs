which indicates that a l=4 line can be used as an impedance
inverter, (i.e., a high impedance at the load can be converted to
a low impedance at the input and vice versa). Using equation
4.36, it follows that a l=4 line with characteristic impedance
given by Z0 ¼
provides matched impedance when
connected between two transmission lines of characteristic
impedances Z01 and Z02. Such a line, known as a quarter-
wave impedance transformer, is frequency-selective (i.e., the
mismatch becomes signiﬁcant as the operating frequency de-
viates from the narrow band around the center frequency at
which the line length ‘ ¼ l=4).
