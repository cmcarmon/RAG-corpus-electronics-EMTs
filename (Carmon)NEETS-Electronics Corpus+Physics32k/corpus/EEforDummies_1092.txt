Other general‐purpose perfboards consist of predrilled holes spaced at regu-
lar intervals in a square or rectangular grid. Different perfboard layouts are 
available. You choose the grid layout that best suits your needs. For instance, 
if your circuit uses many ICs, choose a model that has buses running up 
and down the board, such as the one shown in Figure 15-9. (Alternating the 
buses for the power supply and ground also helps to reduce undesirable 
 inductive and capacitive effects.) If you need to conserve space, construct 
your circuit using a bare perfboard and point‐to‐point wiring, in which you 
pass  components leads through the holes and solder components directly to 
each other.
