CMOS  switching  circuits  are  limited  by  the  charging  and  discharging  times  associated  with  the  output
resistance of the driving gate and the input capacitance of the load gates. Thus, CMOS fan-out depends on the
frequency of switching. With fewer (capacitive) loading inputs to drive, the maximum switching frequency of
CMOS devices will increase.
