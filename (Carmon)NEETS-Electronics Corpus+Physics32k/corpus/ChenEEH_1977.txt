The relatively easy implementation of the preprocessor and
the ability of asynchronous checking are the advantages of the
assigned signature-based methods. The disadvantages are the
performance degradation of the checked processor due to
explicit signature transfer, the need of recompilation of the
source code that prevents checking of existing executables, and
the fact that the sequence of instructions in a node is un-
checked.
