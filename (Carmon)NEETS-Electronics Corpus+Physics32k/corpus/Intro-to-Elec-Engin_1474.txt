If a ﬁlter is added to the television camera optics, so that only the red color passes through, the
camera’s voltage becomes proportional to the intensity of the amount of red in the image. Three
such cameras, all synchronized and viewing the same image, are employed in color television
to decompose the image into its primary color components of red R, green G, and blue B. The
color receiver utilizes a picture tube with three electron beams and a phosphor having R, G,
and B components. While each beam excites one color of phosphor, at any spot in the image
the three colors separately glow with proper intensities in response to the three transmitted color
signals. The viewer’s eye effectively adds the three colors together to reproduce the original scene
in color.
