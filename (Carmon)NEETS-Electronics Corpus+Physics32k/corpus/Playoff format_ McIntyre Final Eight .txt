The original McIntyre Final Eight system is notable in that it uses the regular-season league table to eliminate two teams in the first week of the playoffs. The procedure is:
Week 1
1st Qualifying Final: 4th seed vs 5th seed
2nd Qualifying Final: 3rd seed vs 6th seed
3rd Qualifying Final: 2nd seed vs 7th seed
4th Qualifying Final: 1st seed vs 8th seed
The fates of the teams in this round depend on whether they won or lost their Qualifying Final, and on their regular-season position. The four winners and the two losers that finished highest on the regular-season table advance to later rounds, with the two other losers eliminated.
Week 2
1st Semi-final: 4th highest-ranked winner vs 2nd highest-ranked loser
2nd Semi-final: 3rd highest-ranked winner vs 1st highest-ranked loser
The two losing teams are eliminated, and the two winning teams progress to Week 3.
Week 3
1st Preliminary Final: Highest-seeded Qualifying Final winner vs winner of 1st Semi-final
2nd Preliminary Final: Second-highest-seeded Qualifying Final winner vs winner of 2nd Semi-final
The two losing teams are eliminated, and the two winning teams progress to the Grand Final.
Week 4
Grand Final: winner of 1st Preliminary Final vs winner of 2nd Preliminary Final
Due to perceived weaknesses of this system, the AFL adopted a modified top-eight playoff in 2000. The National Rugby League (NRL), Australia's top rugby league competition (also with a team in New Zealand), used this system from 1999 through 2011, after which it changed to the AFL system.
