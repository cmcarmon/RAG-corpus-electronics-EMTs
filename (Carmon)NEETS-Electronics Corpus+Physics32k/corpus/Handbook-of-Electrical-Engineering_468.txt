Another method of ﬁnding the parameters is to convert from one set to another. Using the “Deﬁnition” row
in  Table 3.2,  we  can  convert  the  deﬁning  equations  of  one  set  to  the  deﬁning  equations  of  another  set.  For
example, we have already found the z parameters. We can ﬁnd the h parameters as follows:
