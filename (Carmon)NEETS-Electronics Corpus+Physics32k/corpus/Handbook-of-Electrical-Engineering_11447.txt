depths in the material is plotted as a function of time. The initial fast-rising segment is due to the more mobile
electrons; the slower component is due to holes. In this example, hole trapping is assumed and manifests itself
in the curvature of the hole segment. The charge collection efﬁciency (η) can be derived from the Hecht relation
[20]. For a photon absorbed at a distance X from the cathode of a planar detector of thickness L operated with
a uniform electric, the relationship becomes
