As you have seen, dc motors are electrically identical to dc generators. In fact, the same dc machine 
may be driven mechanically to generate a voltage, or it may be driven electrically to move a mechanical 
load. While this is not normally done, it does point out the similarities between the two machines. These 
similarities will be used in the remainder of this chapter to introduce you to practical dc motors. You will 
immediately recognize series, shunt, and compound types of motors as being directly related to their 
generator counterparts.
