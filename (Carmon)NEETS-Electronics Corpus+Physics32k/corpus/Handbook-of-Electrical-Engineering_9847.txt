Phase-Lag Compensation
In the phase-lag-compensation frequency domain design approach, we reduce the gain at low frequencies such
that crossover, the frequency where the gain magnitude is 1, occurs before the phase lag has had a chance to
become intolerably large. A simple single-stage phase-lag-compensating network transfer function is
