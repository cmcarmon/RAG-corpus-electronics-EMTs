Electronic circuits ﬁnd applications in many areas, such as automa-
tion, broadcasting, computers, and instrumentation. The range of devices
that use electronic circuits is enormous and is limited only by our imag-
ination. Radio, television, computers, and stereo systems are but a few.
An electrical engineer usually performs diverse functions and is likely
to use, design, or construct systems that incorporate some form of elec-
tronic circuits. Therefore, an understanding of the operation and analysis
of  electronics  is  essential  to  the  electrical  engineer.  Electronics  has
become a specialty distinct from other disciplines within electrical engi-
neering. Because the ﬁeld of electronics is ever advancing, an electronics
engineer must update his/her knowledge from time to time. The best way
to  do  this  is  by  being  a  member  of  a  professional  organization  such  as
the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). With a mem-
bership of over 300,000, the IEEE is the largest professional organization
in the world. Members beneﬁt immensely from the numerous magazines,
journals,  transactions,  and  conference/symposium  proceedings  published
yearly by IEEE. You should consider becoming an IEEE member.
