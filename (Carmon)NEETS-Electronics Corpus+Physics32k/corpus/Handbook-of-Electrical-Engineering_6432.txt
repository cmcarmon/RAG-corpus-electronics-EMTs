A Brief History
Spread spectrum (SS) has its origin in the military arena where the friendly communicator is (1) susceptible
to detection/interception by the enemy and (2) vulnerable to intentionally introduced unfriendly interference
(jamming). Communication systems that employ spread spectrum to reduce the communicatorâ€™s detectability
and combat the enemy-introduced interference are respectively referred to as low probability of intercept (LPI)
and antijam (AJ) communication systems. With the change in the current world political situation wherein
the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) has reduced its emphasis on the development and acquisition of new
communication systems for the original purposes, a host of new commercial applications for SS has evolved,
particularly in the area of cellular mobile communications. This shift from military to commercial applications
of SS has demonstrated that the basic concepts that make SS techniques to useful in the military can also be
put to practical peacetime use. In the next section, we give a simple description of these basic concepts using
the original military application as the basis of explanation. The extension of these concepts to the mentioned
commercial applications will be treated later on in the chapter.
