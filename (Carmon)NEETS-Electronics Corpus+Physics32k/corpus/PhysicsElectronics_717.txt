We often use the expressions 16-bit word (short word) or 32-bit word (long word) depending
on the type of computer being used. Most fast computers today actually employ a 64-bit
word at the hardware level.
If a word has n bits it can represent 2n diﬀerent numbers in the range 0 to 2n−1. Negative
numbers are usually represented by the so called 2’s complement notation. To obtain the
2’s compliment of a number ﬁrst take the complement (invert each bit) and then add 1. All
the negative numbers will have a 1 in the MSB position, and the numbers will now range
from −2n−1 to 2n−1 − 1. The electronic advantages of the 2’s complement notation becomes
evident when addition is performed. Convince yourself of this advantage.
