In the ideal gas version of the traditional Lenoir cycle, the first stage (1-2) involves the addition of heat in a constant volume manner. This results in the following for the first law of thermodynamics:

)



{\displaystyle {}_{1}Q_{2}=mc_{v}\left({T_{2}-T_{1}}\right)}

There is no work during the process because the volume is held constant:

{\displaystyle {}_{1}W_{2}=\int \limits _{1}^{2}{pdV}=0}

and from the definition of constant volume specific heats for an ideal gas:

{\displaystyle c_{v}={\frac {R}{\gamma -1}}}

Where R is the ideal gas constant and γ is the ratio of specific heats (approximately 287 J/(kg·K) and 1.4 for air respectively). The pressure after the heat addition can be calculated from the ideal gas law:
