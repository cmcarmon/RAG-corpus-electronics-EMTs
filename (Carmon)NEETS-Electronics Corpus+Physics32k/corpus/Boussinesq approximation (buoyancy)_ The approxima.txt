The Boussinesq approximation is applied to problems where the fluid varies in temperature from one place to another, driving a flow of fluid and heat transfer. The fluid satisfies conservation of mass, conservation of momentum and conservation of energy. In the Boussinesq approximation, variations in fluid properties other than density ρ are ignored, and density only appears when it is multiplied by g, the gravitational acceleration. If u is the local velocity of a parcel of fluid, the continuity equation for conservation of mass is

If density variations are ignored, this reduces to

where ν (nu) is the kinematic viscosity and F is the sum of any body forces such as gravity. In this equation, density variations are assumed to have a fixed part and another part that has a linear dependence on temperature:

If F = ρg is the gravitational body force, the resulting conservation equation is

In the equation for heat flow in a temperature gradient, the heat capacity per unit volume, ρCρ, is assumed constant. The resulting equation is

where J is the rate per unit volume of internal heat production and κ is the thermal diffusivity.
The three numbered equations are the basic convection equations in the Boussinesq approximation.
