Let us start by looking at the initial interval. For t < 0, the current source
supplies zero current and hence behaves like an open circuit. Assuming that this
situation has existed for a long time, the capacitor will have no charge on it,
and hence vC will be 0. (If the capacitor voltage were nonzero, there would be
