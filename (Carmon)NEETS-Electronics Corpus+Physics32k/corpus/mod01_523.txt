Point C, which is at the same potential as point B, is labeled negative. This is to indicate that point C
is more negative than point D. To say a point is positive (or negative) without stating what the polarity is
based upon has no meaning. In working with Kirchhoffâ€™s law, positive and negative polarities are
assigned in the direction of current flow.
