Clearly, we always have e(A, y) ≤ e(A). To decrease the local error more experiments need to be performed,
whereas to decrease the global error new types of experiments, compatible with new a priori classes, should be
performed, for example, reducing the experimental noise and changing ᏺ accordingly.
