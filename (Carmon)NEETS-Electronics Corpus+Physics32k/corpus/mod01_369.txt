The nickel-cadmium cell (NICAD) is far superior to the lead-acid cell. In comparison to lead-acid 
cells, these cells generally require less maintenance throughout their service life in regard to the adding of 
electrolyte or water. The major difference between the nickel-cadmium cell and the lead-acid cell is the 
material used in the cathode, anode, and electrolyte. In the nickel-cadmium cell the cathode is cadmium 
hydroxide, the anode is nickel hydroxide, and the electrolyte is potassium hydroxide and water.
