Unlike electron flow in a conductor, electrons in a vacuum tube do not move at the speed of light.
Their velocity is determined by the potential difference between the plate and the cathode. The amount of
time the electrons take to travel from the cathode to the plate is called TRANSIT TIME. As a result of
this time difference, the appearance of a signal at the end of a tube is not followed instantaneously by a
change in current flow in the tube. Under normal conditions, the effect of this small time lag between the
input signal and a change in tube current is unnoticed. However, at frequencies such as those used in radar
equipment, this is not the case. Transit time at these frequencies has a very marked effect on tube
operation. It is a major factor that limits the use of a given tube at higher frequencies.
