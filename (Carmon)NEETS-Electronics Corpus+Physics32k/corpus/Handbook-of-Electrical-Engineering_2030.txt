level of a speciﬁc (band-limited) sound to its loudness. An efﬁcient way of measuring the LGF is described by
Allen  et al.  [1990].  Once  the  LGF  of  an  impaired  ear  is  known,  a  multiband  hearing  aid  can  implement  the
necessary  compression  for  each  band  [Villchur,  1973].  Note,  however,  that  this  assumes  that  interactions
between the bands can be neglected (problem of summation of partial loudnesses). This might not be valid
for aids with a large number of bands. Other open questions include the choice of widths and ﬁlter shape of
the bands, and optimization of dynamic aspects of the compression (e.g., time constants). For aids with just
two bands, the crossover frequency is a crucial parameter that is difﬁcult to optimize.
