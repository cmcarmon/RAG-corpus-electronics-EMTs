Graphs 
 
For  each  set  of  measurements  (470  nF  and  10  ÂµF 
for C1 and C2) plot a graph showing the frequency 
response  of  the  amplifier  stage.  In  each  case,  use 
the graph to determine the low-frequency cut-off. 
Conclusion 
Comment on the no-signal voltages measured at the 
collector,  base  and  emitter.    Are  these  what  you 
would  expect?  Comment  on  the  value  of  voltage 
gain that you have obtained. Is this what you would 
expect? Comment on the shape of each  frequency 
response graph. Explain why there is a difference in 
cut-off frequency.
