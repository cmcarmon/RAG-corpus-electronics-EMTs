The distance correlation  of two random variables is obtained by dividing their distance covariance by the product of their distance standard deviations. The distance correlation is

dCov

(
X
,
Y
)


dVar

,


{\displaystyle \operatorname {dCor} (X,Y)={\frac {\operatorname {dCov} (X,Y)}{\sqrt {\operatorname {dVar} (X)\,\operatorname {dVar} (Y)}}},}

and the sample distance correlation is defined by substituting the sample distance covariance and distance variances for the population coefficients above.
For easy computation of sample distance correlation see the dcor function in the energy package for R.
