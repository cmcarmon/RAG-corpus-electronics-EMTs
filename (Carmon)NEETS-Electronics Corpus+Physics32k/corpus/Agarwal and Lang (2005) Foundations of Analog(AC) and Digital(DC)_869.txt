Our inverter produces a high output of VS, so it is easy to see that the high
output can turn the MOSFET in a receiving inverter into its ON state (provided,
of course, that VS > VT). Because the inverter produces a nonzero low output,
more care needs to be taken in the choice of resistance values and the MOSFET
parameters. Specifically, for our inverter design, the voltage output for a logical
0 must be low enough that the MOSFET in the receiver stays OFF. Because
the MOSFET turns ON for an input voltage greater than VT, the following
condition must be met for the low output of one inverter to be able to drive
the MOSFET in another inverter into its OFF state:
