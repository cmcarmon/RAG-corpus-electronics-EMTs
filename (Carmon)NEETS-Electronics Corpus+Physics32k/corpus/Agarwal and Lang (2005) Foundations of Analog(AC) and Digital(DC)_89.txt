The primitive circuit elements, the means for combining them, and the
means of abstraction form the graphical language of circuits. Circuit theory is a
well established discipline. With maturity has come widespread utility. The lan-
guage of circuits has become universal for problem-solving in many disciplines.
Mechanical, chemical, metallurgical, biological, thermal, and even economic
processes are often represented in circuit theory terms, because the mathematics
for analysis of linear and nonlinear circuits is both powerful and well-developed.
For this reason electronic circuit models are often used as analogs in the study of
many physical processes. Readers whose main focus is on some area of electri-
cal engineering other than electronics should therefore view the material in this
