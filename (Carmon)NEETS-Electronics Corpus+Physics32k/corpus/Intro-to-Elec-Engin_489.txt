2. Repeatedly multiply the decimal fraction by 2. If 0 or 1 appears to the left of the decimal
point of the product as a result of this multiplication, then add a 0 or 1 to the binary function.
Continue this process until the fractional part of the product is zero or the desired number
of binary bits is reached.
