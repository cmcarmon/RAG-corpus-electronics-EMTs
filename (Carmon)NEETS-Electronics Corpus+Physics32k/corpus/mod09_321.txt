Figure 2-25, view (A), shows a pulsed oscillator with the resonant tank in the emitter circuit. A 
positive input makes Q1 conduct heavily and current flow through L1; therefore no oscillations can take 
place. A negative-going input pulse (referred to as a gate) cuts off Q1, and the tank oscillates until the 
gate ends or until the ringing stops, whichever comes first.
