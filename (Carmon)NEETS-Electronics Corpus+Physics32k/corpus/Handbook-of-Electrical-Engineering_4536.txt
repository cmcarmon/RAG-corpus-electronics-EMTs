When using IE techniques, the coefﬁcient matrix in the linear system of equations that results is most often
referred to as an impedance matrix because in the case of the E-ﬁeld form, its multiplication of the vector of
unknown currents equals a vector of electric ﬁelds or voltages. The inverse matrix similarly is often called an
admittance matrix because its multiplication of the electric-ﬁeld or voltage vector yields the unknown-current
vector.  In  this  discussion  we  instead  use  the  terms  direct  matrix  and  solution  matrix  because  they  are  more
generic descriptions whatever the forms of the originating integral or differential equations. As illustrated in
the following, development of the direct matrix and solution matrix dominates both the computer time and
storage requirements of numerical modeling.
