The behavior seen in Figure 9.37 also begins to explain the delays seen
in Figure 9.3, although as we shall see in Chapter 10 the details are slightly
different. As we see in Figure 9.37, it takes time for a finite current source to
charge a capacitor, and hence to raise its voltage. In the case of the two inverters
shown in Figure 9.1, it takes time for the first inverter to change the voltage at
the input to the second inverter. This is because it takes time for the first inverter
to charge and discharge the gate-to-source capacitance of the MOSFET in the
second inverter. The time it takes for this voltage to cross the threshold voltage
of the MOSFET is also ultimately responsible for a delay at the output of the
second inverter.
