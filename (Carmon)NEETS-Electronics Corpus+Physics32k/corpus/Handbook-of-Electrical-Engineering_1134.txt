Four basic types of analog ﬁlters are generally used to design digital ﬁlters: (1) Butterworth ﬁlters that are
maximally ﬂat in the passband and decrease monotonically outside the passband, (2) Chebyshev ﬁlters that are
equiripple in the passband and decrease monotonically outside the passband, (3) inverse Chebyshev ﬁlters that
are ﬂat in the passband and equiripple in the stopband, and (4) elliptic ﬁlters that are equiripple in both the
passband and stopband. Techniques for designing these analog ﬁlters are covered elsewhere [see, for example,
Van Valkenberg, 1982] and will not be considered here.
