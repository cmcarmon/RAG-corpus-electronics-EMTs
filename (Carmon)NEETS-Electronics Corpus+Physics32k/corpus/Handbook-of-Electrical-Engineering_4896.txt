Conducting band: The band in which the electrons primarily responsible for the electric current are found.
Effective mass: An electron in a lattice responds differently to applied ﬁelds than would a free electron or a
classical  particle.  One  can,  however,  often  describe  a  particular  response  using  classical  equations  by
deﬁning an effective mass whose value differs from the actual mass. For the same material the effective
mass may be different for different phenomena; e.g., electrical conductivity and cyclotron resonance.
