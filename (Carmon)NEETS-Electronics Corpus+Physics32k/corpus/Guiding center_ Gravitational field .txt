A simple example of a force drift is a plasma in a gravitational field, e.g. the ionosphere. The drift velocity is

Because of the mass dependence, the gravitational drift for the electrons can normally be ignored.
The dependence on the charge of the particle implies that the drift direction is opposite for ions as for electrons, resulting in a current. In a fluid picture, it is this current crossed with the magnetic field that provides that force counteracting the applied force.
