A Persoz pendulum is a device used for measuring hardness of materials. The instrument consists of a pendulum which is free to swing on two balls resting on a coated test panel. The pendulum hardness test is based on the principle that the amplitude of the pendulum's oscillation will decrease more quickly when supported on a softer surface. The hardness of any given coating is given by the number of oscillations made by the pendulum within the specified limits of amplitude determined by accurately positioned photo sensors. An electronic counter records the number of swings made by the pendulum
