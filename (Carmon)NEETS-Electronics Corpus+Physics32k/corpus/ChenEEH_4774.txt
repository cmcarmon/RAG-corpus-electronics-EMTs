This chapter focuses on a systematic treatment for developing a
generic online learning control system based on the fundamen-
tal principle of reinforcement learning or, more speciÔ¨Åcally,
neural dynamic programming. This online learning system
improves its performance over time in two aspects. First, it
learns from its own mistakes through the reinforcement signal
from the external environment and tries to reinforce its action
to improve future performance. Second, system states associ-
ated with the positive reinforcement are memorized through a
network learning process where in the future, similar states will
be more positively associated with a control action leading to a
positive reinforcement. This discussion also introduces a suc-
cessful candidate of online learning control design. Real-time
learning algorithms are derived for individual components in
the learning system. Some analytical insight are provided to give
guidelines on the learning process that takes place in each
module of the online learning control system. The performance
of the online learning controller is measured by its learning
speed, success rate of learning, and the degree to meet the
