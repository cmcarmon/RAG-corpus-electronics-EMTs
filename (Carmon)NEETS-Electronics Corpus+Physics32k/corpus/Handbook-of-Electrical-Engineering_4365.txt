Multimode Pulse Spreading
In a multimode waveguide, different modes travel different path lengths. This results in different travel times
and,  hence,  in  pulse  spreading.  Because  this  pulse  spreading  is  not  wavelength  dependent,  it  is  not  usually
referred to as dispersion. Multimode pulse spreads are given, respectively, for a slab waveguide, a step-index
ﬁber, and a parabolic graded-index ﬁber by the following equations:
