Consider a plane defined by a unit normal vector

k

{\displaystyle \mathbf {n} ={\mathbf {k}  \over k}.}

Then planar traveling wave solutions of the wave equations are

{\displaystyle \mathbf {B} (\mathbf {r} )=\mathbf {B} _{0}e^{-i\mathbf {k} \cdot \mathbf {r} }}

where r = (x, y, z) is the position vector (in meters).
These solutions represent planar waves traveling in the direction of the normal vector n. If we define the z direction as the direction of n. and the x direction as the direction of E, then by Faraday's Law the magnetic field lies in the y direction and is related to the electric field by the relation

{\displaystyle c^{2}{\partial B \over \partial z}={\partial E \over \partial t}.}

Because the divergence of the electric and magnetic fields are zero, there are no fields in the direction of propagation.
This solution is the linearly polarized solution of the wave equations. There are also circularly polarized solutions in which the fields rotate about the normal vector.
