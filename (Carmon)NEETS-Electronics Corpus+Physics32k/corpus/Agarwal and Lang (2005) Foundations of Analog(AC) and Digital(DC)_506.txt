A simple extension of the concept of superposition yields two additional net-
work theorems of great power, which allow us to suppress a lot of detail in
circuit analysis and focus attention only on that part of a network we are really
interested in. Consider, for example, a battery, or a high-fidelity power ampli-
fier, or a wall outlet for 110-V AC power, or a power supply for a computer.
What is the simplest way to describe the electrical properties of each of these
systems at its output terminals? Is one parameter needed, or ten, or fifty? Clearly
the voltage measured with a high-quality meter that draws negligible current
is one important parameter (the open-circuit voltage mentioned in Section 1.7).
Likewise we would want to know the frequency: zero frequency for the battery,
60 hertz (or 50 or even 25 in some countries) for the power line, etc. But we
have already observed another effect that is important. When current is drawn
from any of these systems, the voltage at the terminals drops. Depending on
the quality of the wiring in a dormitory, the lights may dim noticeably when a
toaster is plugged into the same circuit. Or the voltage of the flashlight battery
will drop when a bulb is connected and current flows, as noted in Section 1.7.
How can this effect be characterized? For the battery, is it necessary to make
measurements at 100 current levels, and plot a curve of the characteristic?
