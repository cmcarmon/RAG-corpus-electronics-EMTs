Until recently, RADIO COMMUNICATIONS brought to mind either telegraphy (cw), voice (AM), 
or possibly radio teletypewriter (rtty) communications. Today, radio communications has become a 
highly sophisticated field of electronics. Even small Navy ships have the capability to "come up" on the 
commonly used ship-to-ship, ship-to-air, and ship-to-shore communications circuits. These circuit 
operations are accomplished through the use of compatible and flexible communications systems.
