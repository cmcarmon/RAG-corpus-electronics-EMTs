Electric fields 
 
The  force  exerted  on  a  charged  particle  is  a 
manifestation  of  the  existence  of  an  electric  field. 
The  electric  field  defines 
the  direction  and 
magnitude of a force on a charged object. The field  
itself  is  invisible  to  the  human  eye  but  can  be 
drawn  by  constructing  lines  which  indicate  the 
motion  of  a  free  positive  charge  within  the  field; 
the  number  of  field  lines  in  a  particular  region 
being  used  to  indicate  the  relative  strength  of  the 
field at the point in question.
