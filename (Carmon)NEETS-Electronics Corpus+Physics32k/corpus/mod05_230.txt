A generator that produces a single, continuously alternating voltage is known as a SINGLE-PHASE
alternator. All of the alternators that have been discussed so far fit this definition. The stator (armature)
windings are connected in series. The individual voltages, therefore, add to produce a single-phase ac
voltage. Figure 3-5 shows a basic alternator with its single-phase output voltage.
