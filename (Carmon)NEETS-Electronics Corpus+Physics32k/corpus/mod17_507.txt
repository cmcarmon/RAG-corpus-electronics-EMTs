Satellite orientation in space is important for continuous solar cell and antenna orientation. Since the 
primary source of power in most satellites is from solar cells, a maximum number of the solar cells must 
be exposed to the sun at all times. The satellite antenna must also be pointed at the appropriate earth 
terminals. Our communications satellites use what is termed spin stabilization to meet these important 
requirements.
