In the presence of two phases (α and β), the surface (surface phase) is located in between the phase α and phase β. Experimentally, it is difficult to determine the exact structure of an inhomogeneous surface phase that is in contact with a bulk liquid phase containing more than one solute. Inhomogeneity of the surface phase is a result of variation of mole ratios. A model proposed by Josiah Willard Gibbs proposed that the surface phase as an idealized model that had zero thickness. In reality, although the bulk regions of α and β phases are constant, the concentrations of components in the interfacial region will gradually vary from the bulk concentration of α to the bulk concentration of β over the distance x. This is in contrast to the idealized Gibbs model where the distance x takes on the value of zero. The diagram to the right illustrates the differences between the real and idealized models.
