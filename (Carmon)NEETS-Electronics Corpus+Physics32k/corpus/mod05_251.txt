A three-phase stator can also be connected so that the phases are connected end-to-end; it is now
delta connected (fig. 3-8, view C). (Delta because it looks like the Greek letter delta, D .) In the delta
connection, line voltages are equal to phase voltages, but each line current is equal to 1.73 times the phase
current. Both the wye and the delta connections are used in alternators.
