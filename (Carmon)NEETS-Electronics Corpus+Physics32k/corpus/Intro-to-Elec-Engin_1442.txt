Demodulation of DSB SC AM signals requires a synchronous demodulator, which is also
known as coherent or synchronous detector. That is, the demodulator must use a coherent phase
reference. This is usually generated by means of a phase-locked loop (PLL), which forces the
phase of the voltage-controlled oscillator to follow the phase of the reference signal, to demodulate
the received signal. The need for such a device is a chief disadvantage of the DSB SC scheme.
