Pyrosensitive Smart Materials
Pyrosensitive smart materials are useful in realizing intelligent electromagnetic active surfaces, radar-absorbing
materials, electromagnetic shielding, and so on. For example, it has been demonstrated [Neelakanta et al., 1992]
that  the  microwave  reﬂection  characteristics  at  a  surface  of  a  composite  medium  comprised  of  thermally
controllable, solid-electrolytic zones (made of AgI pellets) show broadband microwave absorption/reﬂection
characteristics under elevated temperatures. This principle can be adopted in conjunction with an electromag-
netic sensor to provide a controllable feedback for thermal activation of fast-ion zones reconﬁgurably in order
to  acheive  smart  active-surface  characteristics.  Exclusive  for  this  application,  depending  on  the  temperature
limited conditions, the solid electrolyte can be chosen on the basis of its a- to b-phase transition characteristics.
In order to keep the cost of the system low, a mixture phase can also be adopted, in which, commensurate with
the elevated temperature operation, the host medium of the mixture could be a ceramic (dielectric).
