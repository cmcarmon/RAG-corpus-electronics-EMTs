the second part of equation 10.57. Then, from the ﬁrst part of
equation 10.57, it is apparent that the unknown shape function
is nonlinearly related to the known (measured) scattered

ﬁeld. In a similar manner, the total ﬁeld
object is related to the dielectric constant distribution er
through the second part of equation 10.58. Therefore, the
ﬁrst part of equation 10.58 implies that the unknown dielectric
constant distribution depends nonlinearly on the known
(measured) scattered ﬁeld. In other words, the inverse scatter-
ing problem is a nonlinear ill-posed problem and various
numerical techniques have been developed to tackle it. Note
also that for the cases of lower dimensionality or under some
circumstances, integral equations 10.57 and 10.58 can be sim-
pliﬁed or transformed into other equivalent forms.
