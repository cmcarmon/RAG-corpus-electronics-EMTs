RADIATION and INDUCTION LOSSES are similar in that both are caused by the fields
surrounding the conductors. Induction losses occur when the electromagnetic field about a conductor cuts
through any nearby metallic object and a current is induced in that object. As a result, power is dissipated
in the object and is lost.
