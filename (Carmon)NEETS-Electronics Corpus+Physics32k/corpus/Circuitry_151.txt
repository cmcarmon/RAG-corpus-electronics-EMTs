Hence the voltage at B relative to Y, VBY, will be  
4.444 V. 
  The  voltage  VAB  will  be  the  difference  between 
VAY and VBY. This, the open-circuit output voltage, 
VAB, will be given by: 
 
VAB = VAY 4 VBY = 5.454 4 4.444 = 1.01 V 
 
Next  we  need  to  find  the  Thévenin  equivalent 
resistance looking in at A and B. To do this, we can 
redraw the circuit, replacing the battery (connected 
between X and Y) with a short-circuit, as shown in 
Fig. 3.17. 
  The  Thévenin  equivalent  resistance  is  given  by 
the relationship:
