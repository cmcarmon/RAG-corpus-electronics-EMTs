Using our multilaunch capabilities, the Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) has 
placed larger and heavier satellites in synchronous equatorial orbits. Figure 4-7 is a drawing of a DSCS 
satellite. It shows each pair of transmit and receive dish antennas. As you can see, a large area of the earth 
can be covered using only one satellite.
