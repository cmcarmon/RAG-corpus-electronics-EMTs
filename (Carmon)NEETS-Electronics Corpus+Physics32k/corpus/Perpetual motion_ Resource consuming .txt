Some examples of such devices include:
The drinking bird toy functions using small ambient temperature gradients and evaporation. It runs until all water is evaporated.
A capillary action-based water pump functions using small ambient temperature gradients and vapour pressure differences. With the "Capillary Bowl", it was thought that the capillary action would keep the water flowing in the tube, but since the cohesion force that draws the liquid up the tube in the first place holds the droplet from releasing into the bowl, the flow is not perpetual.
A Crookes radiometer consists of a partial vacuum glass container with a lightweight propeller moved by (light-induced) temperature gradients.
Any device picking up minimal amounts of energy from the natural electromagnetic radiation around it, such as a solar powered motor.
Any device powered by changes in air pressure, such as some clocks (Cox's timepiece, Beverly Clock). The motion leeches energy from moving air which in turn gained its energy from being acted on.
The Atmos clock uses changes in the vapor pressure of ethyl chloride with temperature to wind the clock spring.
A device powered by radioactive decay from an isotope with a relatively long half-life; such a device could plausibly operate for hundreds or thousands of years.
The Oxford Electric Bell and Karpen Pile driven by dry pile batteries.
