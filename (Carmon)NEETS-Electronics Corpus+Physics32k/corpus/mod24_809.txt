Fiber optic system design is a complicated process that involves link definition and analysis. The
design process begins by providing a complete description of the communication requirements. This
information is used to develop the link architecture and define the communications links. System
designers must decide on the operational wavelength and types of components to use in the system. These
decisions affect numerous system and link design parameters, such as launched power, connection losses,
bandwidth, cost, and reliability.
