that is, we expect the input resistance to be very low. For example, for a typical
case of Rf = 10 k, rt = 1000 , A = 105, the input resistance measured
âˆ’
at the v
terminal will be 0.1 ohm. Simple physical reasoning serves to support
this result. If we imagine applying a small voltage to the input, say 0.1 mV, then
the Op Amp will immediately drive vo to -A times 0.1 mV, or -10 volts. So
resistor Rf has a large voltage across it, hence a large current will flow. This large
current must come from the input source, and is 105 times as large as one might
expect for such a small input voltage. Large current for small voltage means the
effective input resistance will be very small, in fact roughly the feedback resistor
Rf divided by A.
