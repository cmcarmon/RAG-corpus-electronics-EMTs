Model-based reasoning contains a diverse set of approaches
and a collection of loosely connected techniques, with most
applications in the areas of monitoring, control, and diagnosis.
For diagnosis applications, model-based reasoning usually
consists of the following elements: (a) simulate and predict
the normal behavior of the system, (b) record dependencies
between internal model components and predicted observa-
tions, (c) upon detection of abnormal observations, use the
dependencies to identify conï¬‚icting model assumptions, and
(d) in the presence of multiple candidates, apply a measure-
ment strategy to reduce the number of candidates.
