Notice that we have assumed explicitly that the rate of change of charge is
zero for all time so that the current can be an arbitrary function of time. Since
we have assumed that the rate of change of charge is zero for all time, and
because any charge build up would require a nonzero rate of change of charge,
it follows that the net charge within any element must also be zero.4
