An object's transparency is measured by its total transmittance. Total transmittance is the ratio of transmitted light to the incident light. There are two influencing factors; reflection and absorption. For example:
Incident light = 100% - (Absorption = -1% + Reflection = -5%) = Total Transmittance = 94%
