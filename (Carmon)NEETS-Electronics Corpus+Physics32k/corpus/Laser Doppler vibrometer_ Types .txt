Single-point vibrometers – This is the most common type of LDV. It can measure one directional out of plane movement.
Scanning vibrometers – A scanning LDV adds a set of X-Y scanning mirrors, allowing the single laser beam to be moved across the surface of interest.
3-D vibrometers – A standard LDV measures the velocity of the target along the direction of the laser beam. To measure all three components of the target's velocity, a 3-D vibrometer measures a location with three independent beams, which strike the target from three different directions. This allows a determination of the complete in-plane and out-of-plane velocity of the target.
Rotational vibrometers – A rotational LDV is used to measure rotational or angular velocity.
Differential vibrometers – A differential LDV measures the out-of-plane velocity difference between two locations on the target.
Multi-beam vibrometers – A multi-beam LDV measures the target velocity at several locations simultaneously.
Self-mixing vibrometers – Simple LDV configuration with ultra-compact optical head. These are generally based on a laser diode with a built-in photodetector.
Continuous scan laser Doppler vibrometry (CSLDV) – A modified LDV that sweeps the laser continuously across the surface of the test specimen to capture the motion of a surface at many points simultaneously
