In relation to diffusion, the kinematic viscosity provides a better understanding of the behavior of mass transport of a dilute species. Viscosity is related to shear stress and the rate of shear in a fluid, which illustrates its dependence on the mean free path, λ, of the diffusing particles.
From fluid mechanics, for a Newtonian fluid, the shear stress, τ, on a unit area moving parallel to itself, is found to be proportional to the rate of change of velocity with distance perpendicular to the unit area:




τ
=
μ




d


u

d

y





{\displaystyle \tau =\mu {\frac {\mathrm {d} u_{x}}{\mathrm {d} y}}}

for a unit area parallel to the xz-plane, moving along the x axis. We will derive this formula and show how μ is related to λ.
Interpreting shear stress as the time rate of change of momentum, p, per unit area A (rate of momentum flux) of an arbitrary control surface gives

{\displaystyle \tau ={\frac {\dot {p}}{A}}={\frac {{\dot {m}}\left\langle u_{x}\right\rangle }{A}}.}

where ⟨ux⟩ is the average velocity, along the x-axis, of fluid molecules hitting the unit area, with respect to the unit area and ṁ is the rate of fluid mass hitting the surface.
By making simplified assumption that the velocity of the molecules depends linearly on the distance they are coming from, the mean velocity depends linearly on the mean distance:

where
ρ is the density of the fluid,
ū is the root mean square molecular speed: ū = √⟨u2⟩,
λ is the mean free path,
μ is the dynamic viscosity.
Note, that the mean free path itself typically depends (inversely) on the density.
