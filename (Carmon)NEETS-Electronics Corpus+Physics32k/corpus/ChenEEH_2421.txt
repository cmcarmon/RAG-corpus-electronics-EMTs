Figure 6.8(A) shows a communication link between two an-
tennas, with their antenna parameters indicated by a subscript
1 or 2. Each antenna is described with respect to its own
spherical coordinate system, represented with subscripts 1 or
2, having an origin at the center of the corresponding antenna.
First, antenna 1 can be treated as the transmit antenna. The
transmit Ô¨Åeld, EE, radiated from antenna 1 is viewed as the
incident wave, eei, for the receiving antenna 2:
