Compression algorithms can be divided into two major categories: information-preserving, or lossless, and
lossy  techniques.  Information-preserving  techniques  introduce  no  errors  in  the  encoding/decoding  process;
thus, the original signal can be reconstructed exactly. Unfortunately, the achievable compression rate, i.e., the
reduction in bit rate, is quite small, typically on the order of 3:1. On the other hand, lossy techniques introduce
errors in the coding/decoding process; thus, the received signal cannot be reconstructed exactly. The advantage
of  the  lossy  techniques  is  the  ability  to  achieve  much  higher  compression  ratios.  The  limiting  factor  on  the
compression ratio is the required quality of the video signal in a speciÔ¨Åc application.
