The main frame of the oscilloscope is often adapted for many other special applications by the
design of a variety of plug-in assemblies. This modular feature provides much greater versatility than in a
single-trace oscilloscope. For instance, to analyze the characteristics of a transistor, you can replace the
dual-trace, plug-in module with a semiconductor curve-tracer plug-in module.
