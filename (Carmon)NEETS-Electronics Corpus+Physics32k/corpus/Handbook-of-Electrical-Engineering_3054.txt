Active Filters for ICs
It  was  noted  earlier  that  the  advent  of  the  IC  op  amp  made  the  RC-active  ﬁlter  a  practical  reality. A  typical
state-of-the-art 1960–70s active ﬁlter would involve a printed circuit board-mounted circuit comprising discrete
passive components together with IC op amps. Also appearing at this time were hybrid implementations, which
involve special-purpose discrete components and op amp ICs interconnected on a ceramic or glass substrate.
It was recognized, however, that there were considerable beneﬁts to be had from producing an all-IC active ﬁlter.
Production of a quality on-chip capacitor involves substantial chip area, so the scaling techniques referred
to earlier must be used to keep capacitance values down to the low picofarad range. The consequence of this
is that, unfortunately, the circuit resistance values become proportionately large so that, again, there is a chip-
area  problem.  The  solution  to  this  dilemma  emerged  in  the  late  1970s/early  1980s  with  the  advent  of  the
switched-capacitor  (SC)  active  ﬁlter.  This  device,  a  development  of  the  active-RC  ﬁlter  that  is  speciﬁcally
intended for use in IC form, replaces prototype circuit resistors with arrangements of switches and capacitors
that can be shown to simulate resistances, under certain circumstances. The great merit of the scheme is that
the  values  of  the  capacitors  involved  in  this  process  of  resistor  simulation  are  inversely  proportional  to  the
values of the prototype resistors; thus, the ﬁnal IC structure involves principal and switched capacitors that are
