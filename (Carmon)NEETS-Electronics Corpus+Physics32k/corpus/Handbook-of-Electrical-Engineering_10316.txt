The  ﬁrst  efforts  in  DBS  began  in  the  early  1980s  when  COMSAT  built  several  DBS  satellites,  but  did  not
launch  them.  Internationally,  many  countries  currently  have  DBS  services.  Several  European  countries  have
high-powered  DBS  satellites;  many  others  use  medium-powered  satellites.  The  DBS  industry  in  the  United
States is being revitalized by advances in digital video compression technology and the announcement of new
players such as Hughes, Primestar, Echostar, etc. to offer DBS services. Hughes Communications and United
States Satellite Broadcasting (USSB) system using a high-powered DBS satellite is in operation. As an alternative
to the launch of a high-powered satellite, medium-powered DBS systems make use of existing satellites in orbit.
However, larger home antennas are required, approximately 2 feet or greater in diameter. A medium-powered
DBS  in  the  U.S.  is  Primestar.  Digital  video  compression  techniques  using  the  MPEG-2  standard  are  used  to
allow multiple video channels in a transponder. DIRECTV® service, launched in the summer of 1994 by Hughes
Electronics, is an example of the direct satellite system.
