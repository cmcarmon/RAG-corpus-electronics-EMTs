Although the commercial interests have played dominant
roles in setting the speech processing agenda, many other
applications of speech processing continue to be explored.
Biomedicine represents one area, for example, in which speech
engineering is playing an important role in the development of
diagnostic software, techniques for assessment of speech and
hearing therapies, and assistive aids for persons with speech,
hearing, and motor disabilities. At the same time, funding
agencies continue to support new theories and applications
of speech processing, including models of human discourse,
theories of hearing and psychoacoustics, and other basic
research activities. To explore these emerging technologies
and well as the wealth of information about modern applica-
tions, the reader is encouraged to explore the literature cited
here, the further citations to which it leads, and the ever-
increasing amount of information available on the World
Wide Web.
