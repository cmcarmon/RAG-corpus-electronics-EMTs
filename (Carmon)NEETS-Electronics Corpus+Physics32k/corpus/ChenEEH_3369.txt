Let us assume that there are N thermal generators in the
system that share the total load demand of PD. The economic
dispatch problem tries to minimize the total generation costs
for generating power at the N generators while meeting the
load demand PD. In the classical lossless formulation, we also
assume that there are no transmission losses involved, which
simpliÔ¨Åes the optimization considerably. For the lossless case,
the power conservation equation or the power balance equa-
