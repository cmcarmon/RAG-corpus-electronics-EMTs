Suppose we wish to add a pair of two-bit positive numbers A : A1A0
i n t e g e r s
and B : B1B0. We will implement a two-bit adder using two techniques. The first method
will write the truth table for the entire operation and implement it directly. The second
method will first implement a one-bit adder using the truth table method, and then
use the one-bit adder circuit to compose a two-bit adder. Let us denote the answer as
S : S2S1S0.
