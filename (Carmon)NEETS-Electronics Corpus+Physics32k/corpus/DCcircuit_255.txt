Electric current is able to affect more than just skeletal muscles in a shock victim, how-
ever. The diaphragm muscle controlling the lungs, and the heart – which is a muscle in itself
– can also be ”frozen” in a state of tetanus by electric current. Even currents too low to in-
duce tetanus are often able to scramble nerve cell signals enough that the heart cannot beat
properly, sending the heart into a condition known as ﬁbrillation. A ﬁbrillating heart ﬂutters
rather than beats, and is ineffective at pumping blood to vital organs in the body. In any case,
death from asphyxiation and/or cardiac arrest will surely result from a strong enough electric
current through the body. Ironically, medical personnel use a strong jolt of electric current
applied across the chest of a victim to ”jump start” a ﬁbrillating heart into a normal beating
pattern.
