One technique of the former type is adding spare rows and/
or columns of cells and replacing every i-length-segment track
with an (i þ 1)-length track and employing an extra such track
to retain the original routing ﬂexibility (Hatori, 1993). An-
other technique that assumes a nonconventional FPGA archi-
tecture results from work by Shnidman et al. (1998). The
architecture required is one in which the entire routing area
is composed of busses that run the entire span of rows or
