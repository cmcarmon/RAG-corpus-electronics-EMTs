With an internal movement resistance of 500 Ω and a series range resistor of 8.5 kΩ, this
leaves 9 kΩ for an external (lead-to-lead) test resistance at 1/2 scale. In other words, the test
resistance giving 1/2 scale deﬂection in an ohmmeter is equal in value to the (internal) series
total resistance of the meter circuit.
