CAPACITOR LOSSESâ€”Power losses in a capacitor are caused by dielectric leakage and dielectric
hysteresis. Dielectric leakage loss is caused by the leakage current through the resistance in the dielectric.
Although this resistance is extremely high, a small amount of current does flow. Dielectric hysteresis may be
defined as an effect in a dielectric material similar to the hysteresis found in a magnetic material.
