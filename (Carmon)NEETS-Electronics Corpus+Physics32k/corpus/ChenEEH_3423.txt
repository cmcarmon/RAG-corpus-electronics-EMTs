impedance relay may be set to recognize multiple zones of
protection. Due to variety of application reasons, the operating
characteristics of a distance relay may have different shapes, the
quadrilateral and MHO being the most common. The different
operating characteristic shapes are shown in Figure 9.8 (Black-
burn, 1998). The characteristics dictate relay performance for
speciÔ¨Åc application conditions, such as the changes in the
loading levels, different values of fault resistance, effects of
power swings, presence of mutual coupling, and reversals of
fault direction.
