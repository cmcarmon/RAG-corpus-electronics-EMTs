	
In	1882,	there	was	a	circuit	war;	it	was	between	the	notable	electrical	engineers	and
scientists,	Thomas	Edison	(inventor	of	the	DC	system)	and	Nikola	Tesla	(inventor	of	the
AC	system).
While	Thomas	Edison	stated	that	an	efficient	way	of	distributing	power	was	via	a	DC
system,	Nikola	Tesla	argued	that	although	DC	systems	are	efficient,	an	alternating	current
is	the	more	practical	option.	It	started	as	a	simple	clash	of	ideas,	but	it	eventually	led	to	a
major	rift.	Neither	professional	conceded;	both	of	them	insisted	that	their	own	systems
were	“better”.
In	the	end,	it	was	Nikola	Tesla	that	took	home	the	glory.	Case	in	point?	He	was	granted
funds	by	an	internationally	recognized	firm,	Westinghouse.	The	majority	of	the	power
sources	of	New	York	City	were	based	on	the	ideas	of	the	Serbian	engineer;	at	Niagara
Falls	in	Canada,	a	power	plant	was	built.
If	you’re	interested	in	finding	out	more	about	the	particular	circuit	war,	AC	and	DC
systems,	and	all	critical	discussions	on	circuits,	taking	a	course	about	electronic	circuits	is
the	way	to	go.
