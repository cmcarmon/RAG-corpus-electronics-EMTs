The least restrictive constraint on the DIR is the unit energy constraint proposed by Falconer and Magee
[1973]. This leads to yet another form of the receiver structure as shown in Fig. 70.13. However, the adaptation
algorithm for updating the DIR coefﬁcients {bk} is considerably more complicated [Falconer and Magee, 1973].
Note  that  the  ﬁxed  predetermined WMF  and  T-spaced  preﬁlter  combination  of  Falconer  and  Magee  [1973]
has been replaced in Fig. 70.13 by a general fractionally spaced adaptive ﬁlter.
