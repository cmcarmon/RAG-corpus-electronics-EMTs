Using printed circuits 
 
Printed  circuit  boards  (PCB)  comprise  copper 
tracks bonded to an epoxy glass or synthetic resin 
bonded  paper  (SRBP)  board.  The  result  is  a  neat 
and  professional  looking  circuit  that  is  ideal  for 
prototype as  well as production quantities. Printed 
circuits  can  easily  be  duplicated  or  modified  from 
original  master  artwork  and 
the  production 
techniques  arc  quite  simple  and  should  thus  not 
deter the enthusiast working from home. 
  The  following  steps  should  be  followed  when 
laying out a printed circuit board:
