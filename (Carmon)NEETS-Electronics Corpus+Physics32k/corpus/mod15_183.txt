Since the TX, CX, and TR are functionally and physically similar, they can be zeroed in the same 
manner. For the TX and CX to be properly zeroed, electrical zero voltages (S2 = 52V; S1 and S3 = 26V) 
must exist across the stator winding when the rotor of the transmitter is set to 0ยบ or its mechanical 
reference position. The synchro receiver (TR) is properly zeroed when the device it actuates assumes its 
zero or mechanical reference position while electrical zero voltages (S2 = 52V; S1 and S3 = 26V) exist 
across its stator windings. The following is a step-by-step procedure used to zero the TX, CX, and TR.
