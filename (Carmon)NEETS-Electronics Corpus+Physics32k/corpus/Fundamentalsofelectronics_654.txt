In the time-domain, the output for a unit-sample input is known as the system’s unit-sample response,
and is denoted by h (n). Combining the frequency-domain and time-domain interpretations of a linear, shift-
invariant system’s unit-sample response, we have that h (n) and the transfer function are Fourier transform
pairs in terms of the discrete-time Fourier transform.
