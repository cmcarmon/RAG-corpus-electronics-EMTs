One important concept applied in many analog instrumentation signal systems is that of
”live zero,” a standard way of scaling a signal so that an indication of 0 percent can be discrim-
inated from the status of a ”dead” system. Take the pneumatic signal system as an example:
if the signal pressure range for transmitter and indicator was designed to be 0 to 12 PSI, with
0 PSI representing 0 percent of process measurement and 12 PSI representing 100 percent, a
