Problem 5.14: Simulating the Real World
Much of physics is governed by diﬀerential equations, and we want to use signal processing methods to
simulate physical problems. The idea is to replace the derivative with a discrete-time approximation and
solve the resulting diﬀerential equation. For example, suppose we have the diﬀerential equation
