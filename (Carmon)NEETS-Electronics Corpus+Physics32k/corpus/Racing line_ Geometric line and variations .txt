In theory, the optimal path around a race course follows a geometric line, which takes the widest possible arc through a corner. The line starts at the outside of the road, clips a point on the inside, and finishes back outsideâ€”while maintaining a constant radius throughout. The clipping point is called the apex. In a 90 degree corner, for example, where the inner-edge radius is 30 feet and the outer-edge radius is 50 feet, the geometric line radius is 80 feet.
But while this line theoretically represents the fastest way through the corner, it may result in longer overall track times due to slower speeds on the straightaways. To compensate, drivers often delay the point where they begin to turn, thereby shortening the radius when entering the corner and lengthening the radius when exiting. This late apex line allows for earlier acceleration when exiting the corner into the straightaway, but requires slower speeds going in. Race driver Ross Bentley suggests as a rule of thumb: "The faster the corner, the closer to the geometric line you should drive" in order to maintain more speed through the turn. Conversely, "the slower the corner, the more you need to alter your line with a later apex." Doing so allows the driver to gear down for faster acceleration on the exit.
An early apex line, where the driver turns early into the curve, allows a faster entry but a slower exit. The practice is largely considered a beginner mistake.
