to find v and dv/dt at that time. Nevertheless, let us assume for the moment
that we know v and dv/dt at an initial time, and complete the solution for v;
we will return to the initial states shortly. Without loss of generality we will
choose the initial time to be t = 0. In other words, we assume we know the
initial conditions
