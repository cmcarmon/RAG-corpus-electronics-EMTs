logic subfamilies. The ECL family has the highest power dissipation, while the lowest is attained with the CMOS
family. It should be noted that power dissipation for the CMOS family is directly proportional to the gate input
signal frequency. For example, one would typically ﬁnd that the power dissipation for a CMOS logic circuit
would increase by a factor of 100 if the input signal frequency is increased from 1 kHz to 100 kHz.
