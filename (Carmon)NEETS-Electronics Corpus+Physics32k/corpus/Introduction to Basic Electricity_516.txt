An employee should be ensured that any acts of 
retaliation will not be tolerated. If an employee did 
not report harassment for fear of retaliation, which in 
itself is a form of harassment, there would be delays 
in an investigation. Intimidation could also occur be-
cause the harassment was late in being reported. An 
employer can be held liable for any harassment in the 
workplace. Managers and supervisors should take im-
mediate action to eliminate any workplace harassment 
as soon as it is reported and maintain a zero-tolerance 
harassment policy.
