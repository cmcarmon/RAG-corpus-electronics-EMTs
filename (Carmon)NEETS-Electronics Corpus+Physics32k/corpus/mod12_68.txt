Modulation of a carrier can be achieved by any of several methods. Generally, the methods are 
named for the sine-wave characteristic that is altered by the modulation process. In this module, you will 
study AMPLITUDE MODULATION, which includes CONTINUOUS-WAVE MODULATION. You 
will also learn about two forms of ANGLE MODULATION (FREQUENCY MODULATION and 
PHASE MODULATION). A special type of modulation, known as PULSE MODULATION, will also be 
discussed. Before we present the methods involved in developing modulation, you need to study a process 
that is essential to the modulation of a carrier, known as heterodyning.
