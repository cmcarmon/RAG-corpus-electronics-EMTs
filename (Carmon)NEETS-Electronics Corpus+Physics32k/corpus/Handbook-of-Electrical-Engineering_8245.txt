The objective of an analog signal conditioner is to increase the quality of the transducer output to a desired
level before analog-to-digital conversion. A signal conditioner mainly consist of a preampliﬁer, which is either
an instrumentation ampliﬁer or an operational ampliﬁer and/or a ﬁlter. Coupling more and more circuits to
the data acquisition channel has to be done taking great care that these signal conditioning circuits do not add
more noise or unstable behavior to the data acquisition channel. General purpose signal conditioner modules
are commercially available for applications. Some details were given in the previous section about programmable
signal conditioners and the discussion is continued here.
