A mass formula is an equation or set of equations in physics which attempts to predict the mass or mass ratios of the subatomic particles.
An important step in high energy physics was the discovery of the Gell-Mannâ€“Okubo mass formula predicting relationships between masses of the members of SU(3) multiplets.
The development of an accurate mass formula is one of several fundamental aspects to developing a working theory of everything, which is expected to overcome the incompatibilities between current classical and quantum physics theories.
There are currently no universal mass formulae which are generally accepted as correct by the mainstream physics community, however several versions of potential mass formulae have been presented and are currently being explored by some (largely amateur) physics theorists.
