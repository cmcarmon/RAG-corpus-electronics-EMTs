which is twice the bandwidth of the modulating signal. This process is then known as double-
sideband modulation (DSB). Either the lower or the upper sideband may be removed by Ô¨Åltering so
as to obtain single-sideband modulation (SSB) with B= W, if the bandwidth needs to be conserved.
By choosing the carrier frequency fc at a value where the system has favorable characteristics,
the frequency translation by product modulation helps in minimizing the distortion and other
problems in system design.
