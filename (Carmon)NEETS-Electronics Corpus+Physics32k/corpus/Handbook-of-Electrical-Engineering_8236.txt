Once the analog-to-digital conversion is done, the rest of the steps have to deal with digital data only. The
calendar/clock block shown in Fig 84.1 is used to add the time-of-date information, an important parameter
of a real-time processing environment, into the half-processed data. The digital processor performs the overall
system control tasks using a software program, which is usually called system software. These control tasks also
power
include  display,  printer,  data  recorder,  and  communication  interface  management.  A  well-regulated 
supply unit
  (PSU)  and  a  stable  clock  are  essential  components  in  many  data  acquisition  systems.  There  are
systems where massive amounts of data points are produced within a very short period of time, and they are
 so that a considerable amount of data points can be stored locally. Data are
equipped with 
transmitted to the host computer once the local storage has reached its full capacity. Historically, data acquisition
evolved in modular form, until monolithic silicon came along and reduced the size of the modules.
