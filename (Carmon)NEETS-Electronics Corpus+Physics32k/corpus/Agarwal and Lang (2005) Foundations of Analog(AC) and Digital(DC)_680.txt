As illustrated in Figure 4.60c, this two-terminal device can be used to make a
well-behaved DC current source, even starting with a ripple-containing power supply
(depicted as vS), as would be obtained from ordinary rectifier circuits. Suppose the voltage
source vS has an average value VS and a 60-Hz ‘‘ripple component,’’ vr = a cos(ωt) as
shown in Figure 4.60d.
