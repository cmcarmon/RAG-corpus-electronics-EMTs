When optical fibers are connected, optical power may be reflected back into the source fiber. Light
that is reflected back into the source fiber is lost. This reflection loss, called Fresnel reflection, occurs at
every fiber interface. Fresnel reflection is caused by a step change in the refractive index that occurs at
the fiber joint. In most cases, the step change in refractive index is caused by the ends of each fiber being
separated by a small gap. This small gap is usually an air gap. In Fresnel reflection, a small portion of the
incident light is reflected back into the source fiber at the fiber interface. The ratio (R), shown below,
approximates the portion of incident light (light of normal incidence) that is reflected back into the source
fiber.
