*10.3.6 Consider an upgrade of a three-phase transmis-
sion system in which the operating line-to-line
voltage is doubled, and the phase or line currents
are reduced to one-half the previous value, for the
same level of apparent power transfer. Discuss
the consequent effects on the real and reactive
power losses, and on the voltage drop across the
series impedance of the transmission system.
