{\displaystyle U_{\mathrm {el} }(x)={\tfrac {1}{2}}kx^{2}}

which comes from adding up the energy it takes to incrementally compress the spring. That is, the integral of force over displacement. Since the external force has the same general direction as the displacement, the potential energy of a spring is always non-negative.
This potential Uel can be visualized as a parabola on the Ux-plane such that Uel(x) = 1/2kx2. As the spring is stretched in the positive x-direction, the potential energy increases parabolically (the same thing happens as the spring is compressed). Since the change in potential energy changes at a constant rate:

{\displaystyle {\frac {d^{2}U_{\mathrm {el} }}{dx^{2}}}=k\,.}

Note that the change in the change in U is constant even when the displacement and acceleration are zero.
