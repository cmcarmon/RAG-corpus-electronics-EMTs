Besides rectangular patch elements, it is possible to use a variety of other patch shapes as resonant radiating
elements. For purposes of polarization purity and analytical simplicity, however, it is usually preferable to use
rectangular, square, or circular elements. Linear polarization is best obtained with rectangular elements, while
dual linear or circular polarization can be obtained with square or circular patch elements [James and Hall,
1989; Pozar and Schaubert, 1995].
