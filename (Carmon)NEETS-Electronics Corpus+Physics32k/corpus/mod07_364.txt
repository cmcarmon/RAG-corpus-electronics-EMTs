In addition to the two basic modes of operation, the MOSFET, like the JFET, is of either the 
P-channel type or the N-channel type. Each type has four elements: gate, source, drain, and substrate. The 
schematic symbols for the four basic variations of the MOSFET are shown in views A, B, C, and D of 
figure 3-52.
