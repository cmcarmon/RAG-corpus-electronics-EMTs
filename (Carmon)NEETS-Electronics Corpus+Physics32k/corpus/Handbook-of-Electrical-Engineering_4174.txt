Willett et al. [1989] have presented return stroke current, ﬁeld, and speed data from artiﬁcially initiated (by
ﬁring small rockets trailing grounded wires) lightning in an attempt to validate the TL model. Using these data,
Rakov  et al.  [1992]  have  shown,  at  least  for  subsequent  strokes  in  artiﬁcally  initiated  lightning,  that  return
stroke peak current can be derived from return stroke peak ﬁeld by the expression I = 1.5 – 0.037DE where
the peak current I is in kA and is negative, the distance D is in km, and the peak electric ﬁeld E is in V/m and
is  positive.  Several  investigators  have  published  lightning  peak  current  statistics  derived  from  the  magnetic
radiation  ﬁelds  recorded  by  networks  of  magnetic  direction  ﬁnders  by  making  use  of  the  transmission  line
model. These studies are discussed by Rakov et al. [1992].
