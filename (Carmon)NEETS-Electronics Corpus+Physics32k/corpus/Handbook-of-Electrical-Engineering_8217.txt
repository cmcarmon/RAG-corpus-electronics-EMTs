Color Plasma Display Devices
Color  is  achieved  by  placing  phosphors  in  the  plasma  panel  and  then  exciting  those  phosphors  with  the
ultraviolet light of the gas discharge. This is the same principle as used in the ï¬‚uorescent lamp. Xenon is the
active UV generating gas which provides atomic resonance radiation at 147 nm and a molecular band centered
at 173 nm. Neon or helium buffer gases are always mixed with the xenon.
