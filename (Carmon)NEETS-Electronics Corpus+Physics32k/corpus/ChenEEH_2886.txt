Radar detection can be based on a single pulse echo. It can also
be based on the integration of many pulses returned from a
particular target.
Integration can be accomplished either
before or after the detector. Integration before the detector
is called predetection integration or coherent integration
because both amplitude and phase of each pulse echo can be
preserved in the integration. Integration after the detector is
called postdetection or incoherent integration, indicating the
phase is not preserved after detector.
