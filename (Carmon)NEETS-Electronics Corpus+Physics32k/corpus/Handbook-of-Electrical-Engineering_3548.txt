event activity via messages. Messages are communicated using conservative or optimistic strategies. Optimistic
 make assumptions about future event activity
message-passing strategies, such as 
to advance local device simulation. If the assumptions are correct, the processors operate more independently
and better exploit parallel computation. However, if the assumptions are incorrect, then local device simulations
may be forced to “roll back” to synchronize local device simulations [Bryant, 1979; Chandy and Misra, 1981].
Schedule-driven,  cycle-driven,  and  message-driven  simulations  are  software-based  simulation  acceleration
techniques. Simulation can also be accelerated by relegating certain simulation activities to dedicated hardware.

For  example, 
evaluation. As the name implies, hardware modeling uses actual hardware devices instead of software models
to obtain stimulus/response information. Using actual hardware devices reduces the expense of generating and
maintaining  software  models  and  provides  an  environment  to  support  application  software  development.
However, it is sometimes difﬁcult for a slave hardware modeler to preserve accurate real-time device operating
response characteristics within a master non-real-time software simulation environment. For example, some
hardware devices may not be able to retain state information between invocations, so the hardware modeler
must save the history of previous inputs and reapply them to bring the hardware device to the correct state to
apply a new input.
