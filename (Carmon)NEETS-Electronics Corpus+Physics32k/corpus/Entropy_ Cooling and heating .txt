For heating or cooling of any system (gas, liquid or solid) at constant pressure from an initial temperature

{\displaystyle \Delta S=nC_{P}\ln {\frac {T}{T_{0}}}.}

provided that the constant-pressure molar heat capacity (or specific heat) CP is constant and that no phase transition occurs in this temperature interval.
Similarly at constant volume, the entropy change is

where the constant-volume heat capacity Cv is constant and there is no phase change.
At low temperatures near absolute zero, heat capacities of solids quickly drop off to near zero, so the assumption of constant heat capacity does not apply.
Since entropy is a state function, the entropy change of any process in which temperature and volume both vary is the same as for a path divided into two steps – heating at constant volume and expansion at constant temperature. For an ideal gas, the total entropy change is
