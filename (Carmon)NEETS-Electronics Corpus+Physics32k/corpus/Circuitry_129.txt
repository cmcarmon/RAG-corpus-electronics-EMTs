Surface mounted components (SMC) 
 
Surface  mounting  technology  (SMT)  is  now 
widely  used  in  the  manufacture  of  printed  circuit 
boards  for  electronic  equipment.  SMT  allows 
circuits  to  be  assembled  in  a  much  smaller  space 
than  would  be  possible  using  components  with 
conventional wire leads and pins that are mounted 
using through-hole techniques. It is also possible to 
mix  the  two  technologies,  i.e.  some  through-hole 
mounting  of  components  and  some  surface 
mounted  components  present  on  the  same  circuit 
board. The following combinations are possible:
