method. Active methods achieve fault tolerance by detecting the existence of faults and performing some action
to  remove  the  faulty  hardware  from  the  system.  In  other  words,  active  techniques  require  that  the  system
perform reconÔ¨Åguration to tolerate faults. Active hardware redundancy uses fault detection, fault location, and
fault recovery in an attempt to achieve fault tolerance. An example of an active approach to hardware redundancy
is standby sparing, which is illustrated in Fig. 93.2. In standby sparing one or more units operate as spares and
replace the primary unit when it fails.
