The driving torque



T


{\displaystyle T}
to overcome rolling resistance




R

r




{\displaystyle R_{r}}
and maintain steady speed on level ground (with no air resistance) can be calculated by:




T
=



V

s


Ω



R

r




{\displaystyle T={\frac {V_{s}}{\Omega }}R_{r}}

where





V

s




{\displaystyle V_{s}}
is the linear speed of the body (at the axle), and




Ω


{\displaystyle \Omega }
its rotational speed.

It is noteworthy that




V

s



/

Ω


{\displaystyle V_{s}/\Omega }
is usually not equal to the radius of the rolling body.
