In real-world scenarios, the balance point may be determined in one of two ways. In the energy signature method, a plot is created mapping electric energy consumption against mean outdoor temperature. The point on the chart at which weather independent and weather dependent electricity demand intersect is the balance point temperature. This method only works if large quantities of data on the building energy use are available, preferably on a daily resolution.
In the performance line method multiple plots of electric energy consumption against heating degree days (HDD) and cooling degree days (CDD) are created, using a range of balance point temperatures to calculate the degree days. Best-fit second-order polynomials of the form y=ax2+bx+c are then applied to the plots, which show various levels of curvature across the range of the data depending on the accuracy of the balance point temperature. In plots with overly high balance point temperatures the a variable is positive, resulting in an upward curve, while plots with low balance point temperatures curve downward due to a negative a variable. The plot in which a is closest to zero represents the most accurate balance point temperature. This method may be applied to buildings in which the availability of energy use data is less granular, perhaps only available on a weekly or monthly basis.
