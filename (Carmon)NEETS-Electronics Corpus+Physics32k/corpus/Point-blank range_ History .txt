The term point-blank is of French origin, deriving from pointé à blanc, "pointed at white", with the word blanc used to describe a small white aiming spot formerly at the center of shooting targets. Point-blank range denotes the distance a marksman can expect to fire a specific weapon and hit a desired target without adjusting its sights. If a weapon is sighted correctly and ammunition reliable, the same spot should be hit every time at point-blank range.
The term originated with the techniques used to aim muzzle-loading cannon. Their barrels tapered from breech to muzzle, so that when the top of the cannon was held horizontal its bore actually sat at an elevated angle. This caused the projectile to rise above the natural line of sight shortly after leaving the muzzle, then drop below it after the apex of its slightly parabolic trajectory was reached.
By repeatedly firing a given projectile with the same charge, the point where the shot fell below the bottom of the bore could be measured. This distance was considered the point-blank range: any target within it required the gun to be depressed; any beyond it required elevation, up to the angle of greatest range at somewhat before 45 degrees.
Various cannon of the 19th century had point-blank ranges from 250 yards (230 m) (12 lb howitzer, 0.595 lb (0.270 kg) powder charge) to nearly 1,075 yards (983 m) (30 lb carronade, solid shot, 3.53 lb (1.60 kg) powder charge).
