(Oppenheim et al., 1999; oppenheim and Willsky, 1997). We
will assume that the auxiliary conditions are consistent with
the LSI requirement. A condition of initial rest is assumed for
the systems, so that we will be dealing only with linear shift-
invariant systems described by the difference or differential
equation.
