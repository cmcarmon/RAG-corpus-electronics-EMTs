a bounding box is used to track an object throughout the
compressed video stream. This is accomplished by exploiting
the motion vector information embedded in the coded video
bit stream. A k-means clustering of the motion vectors is used
to avoid occlusions. Schonfeld et al. (2003) presented an ex-
tension of this approach. After initial segmentation of the
object contour, they used an adaptive block matching process
to predict the object contour in successive image sequences.
