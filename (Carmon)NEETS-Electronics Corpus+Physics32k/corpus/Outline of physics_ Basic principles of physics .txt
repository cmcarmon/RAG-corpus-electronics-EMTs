Physics – branch of science that studies matter and its motion through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. Physics is one of the "fundamental sciences" because the other natural sciences (like biology, geology etc.) deal with systems that seem to obey the laws of physics. According to physics, the physical laws of matter, energy and the fundamental forces of nature govern the interactions between particles and physical entities (such as planets, molecules, atoms or the subatomic particles). Some of the basic pursuits of physics, which include some of the most prominent developments in modern science in the last millennium, include:
Describing the nature, measuring and quantifying of bodies and their motion, dynamics etc.
Newton's laws of motion
Mass, force and weight
Momentum and conservation of energy
Gravity, theories of gravity
Energy, work, and their relationship
Motion, position, and energy
Different forms of Energy, their interconversion and the inevitable loss of energy in the form of heat (Thermodynamics)
Energy conservation, conversion, and transfer.
Energy source the transfer of energy from one source to work in another.
