Code-division multiple access (CDMA) modulates each carrier with a unique pseudo-random code, usually
by means of either a direct sequence or frequency hopping spread spectrum modulation. CDMA users occupy
the  same  frequency  band  at  the  same  time.  The  aggregate  signal  in  the  satellite  ampliﬁer  is  noise-like  and
individual signals are extracted at the receiver by correlation processes. CDMA tolerates noise-like interference
but does not tolerate large deviations from average loading conditions. One or more very strong carriers could
violate the noise-like interference condition and generate strong intermodulation signals. Careful power control
of each user’s signal is usually required in CDMA systems.
