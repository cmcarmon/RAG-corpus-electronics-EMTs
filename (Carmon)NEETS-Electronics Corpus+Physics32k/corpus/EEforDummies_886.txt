expose a half‐inch or so of bare 
wire so you can solder a connec-
tion or insert the wire into the 
holes of a solderless breadboard 
(which I discuss next). A good 
wire stripper contains notches 
allowing you to neatly and easily strip just the plastic insulation from 
wires of various sizes (known as gauges, as described in Chapter 12), 
without nicking the copper wire inside. You can also find a combination 
wire cutter and stripper, but you may have to perform your own gauge 
 control.
