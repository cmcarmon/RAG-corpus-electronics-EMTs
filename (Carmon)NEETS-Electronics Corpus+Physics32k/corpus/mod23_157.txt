Magnetic head construction is basically the same for all magnetic heads. They're all made up of a 
magnetic core wrapped with a coil of very thin wire. But, there's where the similarity ends. From here on, 
each magnetic head is built to perform a specific job. Will the head be used on a single track recorder? 
Will it be used on a multitrack recorder? Will it be a record head or a reproduce head? Or, will it be an 
erase head? What frequency will it be recording and/or reproducing? The answers to these questions will 
determine the final construction of a magnetic head.
