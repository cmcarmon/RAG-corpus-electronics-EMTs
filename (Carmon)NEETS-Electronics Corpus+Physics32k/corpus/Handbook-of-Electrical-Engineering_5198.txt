Piezoelectric property: Ability of a material to induce opposite charges at two faces (correspondingly to exhibit
a  voltage  difference  between  the  faces)  of  the  material  as  a  result  of  the  strain  due  to  a  mechanical  force
applied across the faces; reversibly, application of a potential across the faces would induce a mechanical strain.
Piezoelectric smart materials: Materials capable of changing their elastic characteristics (by virtue of their
piezoelectric property) self-adaptively in response to an externally applied electric potential proportional
to the observed elastic behavior.
