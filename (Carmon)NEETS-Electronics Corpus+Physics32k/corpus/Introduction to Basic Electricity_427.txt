Accidental death can also result from equipment be-
coming energized due to electrical faults, lack of main-
tenance, or short circuit. Electrical accidents are most 
often caused by a combination of factors such as these:
■● Lack of supervision
■● Lack of training
■● Inadequate work practices
■● Poorly maintained equipment or installation
■● Hazardous workplace environment
■● Unauthorized electrical repairs
