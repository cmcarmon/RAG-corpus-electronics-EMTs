Assume that diode D2 was conducting and switch S1 is turned on. The current carried by D2 will be
transferred to S1 almost instantaneously (except for a small time of recovery of D2 during which input
supply  is  shorted  through  D2  and  S1,  and  the  current  is  limited  by  the  di/dt  limiting  inductors).  The
