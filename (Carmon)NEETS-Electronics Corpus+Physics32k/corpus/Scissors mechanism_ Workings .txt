Extension is achieved by applying pressure to the outside of a set of supports located at one end of the mechanism, elongating the crossing pattern. This can be achieved through hydraulic, pneumatic, mechanical or simply muscular means.
It may require no power to return to its original position, but simply a release of the original pressure.also used in kinematic of mechanisms
