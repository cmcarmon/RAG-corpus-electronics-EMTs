A fuse must perform two functions. The ﬁrst, the “passive” function, is one that tends to be taken for granted.
In fact, if the fuse performs the passive function well, we tend to forget that the fuse exists at all. The passive
function  simply  entails  that  the  fuse  can  carry  up  to  its  normal  load  current  without  aging  or  overheating.
Once the current level exceeds predetermined limits, the “active” function comes into play and the fuse operates.
It is when the fuse is performing its active function that we become aware of its existence.
