Circuit	hacking,	since	it	is	linked	with	the	word	hacking,	can	sometimes	be
perceived	as	fraudulent.	However,	there	is	nothing	fraudulent	with	it	since	the
main	reason	why	there	are	circuit	hackers	is	for	the	improvement	or	the	revision	of
a	project;	hacking,	in	this	essence,	is	defined	as	the	modification	of	an	existing
circuit	to	use	it	for	a	different	purpose.	And,	in	most	cases,	a	circuit	hacker	is	an
individual	who	exhibits	cleverness,	open-mindedness,	and	technical	aptness.
Due	to	a	few	similar	concepts,	circuit	hacking	and	reverse	engineering	are	said	to
be	one	and	the	same;	they	are	not.	While	both	may	include	certain	techniques	that
are	intended	for	the	improvement	of	a	circuit’s	operations,	the	former	is	merely
focused	on	developing	an	existing	circuit;	it	may	be	invasive,	too,	but	it	doesn’t
involve	the	deconstruction	of	an	entire	circuit.	Especially	if	it	was	determined	that
the	installment	of	a	particular	component	can	achieve	a	desired	functionality,
having	to	tear	apart	the	other	sections	of	a	circuit	is	deemed	unnecessary.
