Maximum a posteriori Estimation
A widely used speaker adaptation method maximizes the posterior estimation of HMMs [3]. The conventional
maximum likelihood (ML) based algorithms assume the HMM parameters to be unknown but Ô¨Åxed, and the
parameter estimators are derived entirely from the training observation sequence using the Baum-Welch algo-
rithms.  Sometimes,  prior  information  about  the  HMM  parameters  is  available,  whether  from  subject  matter
