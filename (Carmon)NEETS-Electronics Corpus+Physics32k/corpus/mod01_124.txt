A material with a low reluctance, such as soft iron or annealed silicon steel, is relatively easy to
magnetize but will retain only a small part of its magnetism once the magnetizing force is removed.
Materials of this type that easily lose most of their magnetic strength are called TEMPORARY
MAGNETS. The amount of magnetism which remains in a temporary magnet is referred to as its
