Performance Evaluation
As shown in Fig. 16.1, the Kalman ﬁlter computes the covariance matrix of the estimation error (Pk). However,
in practical applications, this theoretical covariance matrix may be extremely optimistic, owing to the effects
noted earlier (nonlinearity, ill-conditioning, data association errors, unresolved data, errors in modeling both
measurement errors and target dynamics) as well as bugs in the software itself. Therefore, the standard approach
to evaluate Kalman ﬁlter performance is Monte Carlo simulation. However, no one in their right mind would
believe the results of a complex Monte Carlo simulation without a back-of-the-envelope calculation that is in
rough agreement with the simulation results. A good source of such simple formulas is Brookner [1998].
