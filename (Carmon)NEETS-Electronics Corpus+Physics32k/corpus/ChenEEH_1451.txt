The operating system of a computer is software, which con-
trols all the computer’s resources and provides the base upon
which the application programs can be written. Modern oper-
ating systems also provide numerous services, such as inter-
process communication, ﬁle and directory systems, data
transfer over networks, and a command language for invoking
and controlling programs.
