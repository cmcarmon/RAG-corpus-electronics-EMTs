1. M: maximum overshoot
2. % overshoot = M/A · 100%, where A is the ﬁnal value of the time response
3. td: delay time—the time required to reach 50% of A
4. tr: rise time—the time required to go from 10% of A to 90% of A
5. ts: settling time—the time required for the response to reach and stay within 5% of A
