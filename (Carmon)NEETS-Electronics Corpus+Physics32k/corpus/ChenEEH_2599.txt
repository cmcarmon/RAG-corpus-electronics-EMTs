they are good candidates for narrow band designs. The dual-
mode ring and square-patch resonators can simultaneously
induce two resonant modes that are orthogonal in space and
are excited by the two orthogonally arranged input and output
lines. The coupling between the two modes is accomplished by
a topological perturbation that takes place along the symmet-
rical axes with respect to the input and output lines.
