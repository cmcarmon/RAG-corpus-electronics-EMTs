The formula above made it much easier to estimate the energy-based magnitude Mw, but it changed the fundamental nature of the scale into a moment magnitude scale. Caltech seismologist Thomas C. Hanks noted that Kanamori’s Mw scale was very similar to a relationship between ML and M0 that was reported by Thatcher & Hanks (1973)

{\displaystyle M_{L}\approx (\log M_{0}-9.0)/1.5}

Hanks & Kanamori (1979) combined their work to define a new magnitude scale based on estimates of seismic moment

{\displaystyle M=(\log M_{0}-9.05)/1.5}

Although the formal definition of moment magnitude is given by this paper and is designated by M, it has been common for many authors to refer to Mw as moment magnitude. In most of these cases, they are actually referring to moment magnitude M as defined above.
