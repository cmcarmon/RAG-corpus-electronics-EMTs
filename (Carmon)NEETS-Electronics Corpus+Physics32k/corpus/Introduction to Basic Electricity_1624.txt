through the film, the length of the resistor, sets the 
value of the resistor. The closer the pitch of the  spiral, 
the higher the resistance. Carbon film resistors are 
available from 10 ohms to 2.5 megohms at a 61% 
 tolerance. Metal	film	resistors are physically  similar 
to carbon film resistors but use a metal alloy and are 
more expensive. They are available from 10 ohms to 
1.5 megohms at a 61% tolerance, although tolerances 
down to 60.1% are available. Another type of film 
 resistor is the tin oxide resistor (Figure 13‑9). It 
 consists of a tin oxide film on a ceramic substrate and 
is also  available in a single inline format or dual‑inline 
pin format.
