Information-Preserving Coders
The data rate required for an original digital video signal may not represent its average information rate. If the
original signal is represented by M possible independent symbols with probabilities pi , i = 0, 1,..., M – 1, then
the information rate as given by the ﬁrst-order entropy of the signal  H is
