This discussion involving the energy equation is with respect to rotationally symmetric flow. This analysis will take into consideration the effect of gravitational acceleration on flow and heat transfer. The mathematical equations to follow apply both to rotational symmetric flow as well as two-dimensional planar flow.

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial }{\partial s}}(\rho ur_{o}^{n})+{\frac {\partial }{\partial y}}(\rho vr_{o}^{n})=0}

where:




s


{\displaystyle s}
is the rotational direction, i.e. direction parallel to the surface




u


{\displaystyle u}
is the tangential velocity, i.e. velocity parallel to the surface




y


{\displaystyle y}
is the planar direction, i.e. direction normal to the surface




v


{\displaystyle v}
is the normal velocity, i.e. velocity normal to the surface





r

{\displaystyle r_{o}}

In this equation the superscript n is to differentiate between rotationally symmetric flow from planar flow. The following characteristics of this equation hold true.




n


{\displaystyle n}
= 1: rotationally symmetric flow




n


{\displaystyle n}
= 0: planar, two-dimensional flow

{\displaystyle \rho \left(u{\frac {\partial u}{\partial s}}+v{\frac {\partial u}{\partial y}}\right)={\frac {\partial }{\partial y}}\left(\mu {\frac {\partial u}{\partial y}}\right)-{\frac {dp}{ds}}+\rho g.}

From here we can further simplify the momentum equation by setting the bulk fluid velocity to 0 (u = 0).

This relation shows that the pressure gradient is simply a product of the bulk fluid density and the gravitational acceleration. The next step is to plug in the pressure gradient into the momentum equation.

To find the Grashof number from this point, the preceding equation must be non-dimensionalized. This means that every variable in the equation should have no dimension and should instead be a ratio characteristic to the geometry and setup of the problem. This is done by dividing each variable by corresponding constant quantities. Lengths are divided by a characteristic length,
