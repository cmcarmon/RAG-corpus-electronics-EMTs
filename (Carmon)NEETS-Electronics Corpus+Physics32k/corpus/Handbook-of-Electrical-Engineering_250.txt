Once KCL has been written for the nodes of a circuit, the equations can be rewritten by substituting into
the equations the voltage-current relationships of the individual components. If a circuit is resistive, the resulting
equations will be algebraic. If capacitors or inductors are included in the circuit, the substitution will produce
a differential equation. For example, writing KCL at the node for
