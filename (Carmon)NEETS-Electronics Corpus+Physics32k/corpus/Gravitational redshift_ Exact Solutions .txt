A table of exact solutions of the Einstein field equations consists of the following:
The more often used exact equation for gravitational redshift applies to the case outside a non-rotating, uncharged mass which is spherically symmetric. The equation is:

, where




G



{\displaystyle G\,}
is the gravitational constant,




M



{\displaystyle M\,}
is the mass of the object creating the gravitational field,





R

∗





{\displaystyle R^{*}\,}
is the radial coordinate of the point of emission (which is analogous to the classical distance from the center of the object, but is actually a Schwarzschild coordinate),




r
,


{\displaystyle r,}
is the radial coordinate of the observer (in the formula, this observer is at an infinitely large distance), and




c



{\displaystyle c\,}
is the speed of light.
