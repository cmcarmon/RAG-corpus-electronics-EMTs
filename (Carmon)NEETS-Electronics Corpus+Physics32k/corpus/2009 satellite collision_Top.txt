The accidental 2009 satellite collision was the first time a hypervelocity collision occurred between two artificial satellites - until then, all accidental hypervelocity collisions happened between a satellite and a piece of space debris. It occurred on February 10, 2009, 16:56 UTC, when Iridium 33 and Cosmos-2251 collided at a speed of 42,120 km/h (11.70 km/s; 26,170 mph) and an altitude of 789 kilometres (490 mi) above the Taymyr Peninsula in Siberia.
