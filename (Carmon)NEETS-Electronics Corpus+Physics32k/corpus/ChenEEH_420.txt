A small-signal model of the OTA is shown in Figure 4.16(A)
including parasitic input and output capacitors (of the order
0.01 to 0.05 pF) and the Ô¨Ånite output resistance (of the order of
0.1 to 2 MV). We have shown the lower output terminal
grounded because for
simplicity we shall assume that
designs are single-ended for the sake of this discussion. In
IC analog circuitry is designed in differential
practice,
form for better noise immunity,
linearity, and dynamic
range. Conversion to differential circuitry is straightforward.
The customary circuit symbol for the OTA is shown in Figure
4.16(B).
