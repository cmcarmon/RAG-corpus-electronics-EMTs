If the two frequencies are harmonics of the bit-interval duration, f0 =
bandwidth equals k1 − k0 + 1
. If the diﬀerence between harmonic numbers is 1, then the FSK bandwidth
is smaller than the BPSK bandwidth. If the diﬀerence is 2, the bandwidths are equal and larger diﬀerences
produce a transmission bandwidth larger than that resulting from using a BPSK signal set.

The receiver interested in the transmitted bit stream must perform two tasks when received waveform r (t)
begins.
