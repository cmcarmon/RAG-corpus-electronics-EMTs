The fast multipole method (FMM) is an alternative to MoM or Ewald summation. It is an accurate simulation technique and requires less memory and processor power than MoM. The FMM was first introduced by Greengard and Rokhlin and is based on the multipole expansion technique. The first application of the FMM in computational electromagnetics was by Engheta et al.(1992). FMM can also be used to accelerate MoM.
