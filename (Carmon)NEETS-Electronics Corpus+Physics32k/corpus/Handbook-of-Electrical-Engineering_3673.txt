Crystalline Anisotropy
Crystalline anisotropy arises from the existence of easy and hard directions of magnetization within the crystal
structure of the material. For example, in iron the {100} directions are easy directions while the {111} directions
are hard. In nickel crystals the reverse is true. In cobalt the hexagonal {00.1} directions are easy and the {10.0}
directions in the basal plane are hard.
