Since the methods just described to Ô¨Ånd the effective R and
X are rather involved, an alternative and practical method can
be used to measure the current (IL) and voltage at the regulator
location and the voltage at the regulating point. The difference
between the two voltage values is the total voltage drop be-
tween the regulator and the regulation point, which can be
found as:
