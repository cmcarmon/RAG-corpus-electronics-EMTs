do not distinguish between displacement of the power
factor (i.e., the cosine between the voltage and current
phasors at the fundamental frequency) and the power
factor deÔ¨Åned in Table 10.4. The term true power factor
has been used by some to refer to P=jVjjIj, but the IEEE
Standard 100 used the term power factor for this ratio,
and this simpler term is used in this chapter.
