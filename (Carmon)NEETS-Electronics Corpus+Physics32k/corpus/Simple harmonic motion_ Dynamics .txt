In Newtonian mechanics, for one-dimensional simple harmonic motion, the equation of motion, which is a second-order linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients, can be obtained by means of Newton's second law and Hooke's law for a mass on a spring.

{\displaystyle F_{\mathrm {net} }=m{\frac {\mathrm {d} ^{2}x}{\mathrm {d} t^{2}}}=-kx,}

where m is the inertial mass of the oscillating body, x is its displacement from the equilibrium (or mean) position, and k is a constant (the spring constant for a mass on a spring). (Note that in reality this is in fact an approximation, only valid for speeds that are small compared to the speed of light.)
Therefore,

Solving the differential equation above produces a solution that is a sinusoidal function.

In the solution, c1 and c2 are two constants determined by the initial conditions, and the origin is set to be the equilibrium position. Each of these constants carries a physical meaning of the motion: A is the amplitude (maximum displacement from the equilibrium position), ω = 2πf is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase.
Using the techniques of calculus, the velocity and acceleration as a function of time can be found:

By definition, if a mass m is under SHM its acceleration is directly proportional to displacement.

{\displaystyle T=2\pi {\sqrt {\frac {m}{k}}}.}

These equations demonstrate that the simple harmonic motion is isochronous (the period and frequency are independent of the amplitude and the initial phase of the motion).
