Mathematical/Circuit Models.
There are various models for synchronous machines, depending on how much
detail one needs in an analysis. In the simplest model, the machine is equivalent to a constant voltage source
in series with an impedance. In more complex models, numerous nonlinear differential equations are involved.
When a machine is in a steady state, the model requires no differential equations. The
