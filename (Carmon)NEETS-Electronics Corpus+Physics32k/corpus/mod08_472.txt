MAGNETIC AMPLIFIERS use the principle of electromagnetism to amplify signals. They are
power amplifiers with a frequency response normally limited to 100 hertz or below. Magnetic amplifiers
use a saturable-core reactor. A magnetic amplifier uses a RECTIFIER to solve the problem of
HYSTERESIS LOSS in a saturable-core reactor.
