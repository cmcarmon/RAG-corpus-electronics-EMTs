Circuit grounding design is dependent on the function of each type of circuit. In unbalanced systems, care
must  be  taken  to  reduce  the  potential  of  common  mode  noise.  Differential  devices  are  commonly  used  to
suppress  this  form  of  noise.  The  use  of  high  circuit  impedances  should  be  minimized.  Where  it  cannot  be
avoided, all interconnecting leads should be shielded, with the shield well grounded. Power supply grounding
must be done properly to minimize load inducted noise on a power supply bus. When electromechanical relays
are used in a system, it is best that they be provided with their own power supplies.
