Variables and constants 
 
Unfortunately, we don’t always know the value of a 
particular  quantity  that  we  need  to  use  in  a 
calculation. In some cases the value might actually 
change, in which case we refer to it as a variable.
In  other  cases,  the  value  might  be  fixed  but  we 
might prefer not to actually quote it’s value. In this 
case we refer to the value as a constant.
