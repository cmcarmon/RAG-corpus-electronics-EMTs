Let us illustrate using the step response of a series RC circuit in
Figure 10.11a as an example. We will address the most general case, namely one
in which there is both a nonzero initial state and a nonzero input. The seemingly
elaborate arrangement of switches simply provides for the initial voltage VO on
the capacitor, and an input step voltage of magnitude V at t = 0, a situation
similar to that in Section 10.1.3. For the purposes of sketching our result, we
will further assume that V > VO. As illustrated in Figure 10.11a, switch S1 is
initially closed and S2 is open, resulting in the voltage VO being applied directly
across capacitor. Just before t = 0, that is, at t = 0
, S1 is opened (S2 remains
open). Then, at t = 0, S2 is closed (S1 remains open). The closing of S2 and
opening of S1 results in an series RC circuit with a step voltage V applied at
t = 0.
