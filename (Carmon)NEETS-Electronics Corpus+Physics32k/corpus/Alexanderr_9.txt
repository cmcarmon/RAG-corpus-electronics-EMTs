Electric circuits are used in numerous electrical systems to accom-
plish  different  tasks.  Our  objective  in  this  book  is  not  the  study  of
various uses and applications of circuits. Rather, our major concern is
the  analysis  of  the  circuits.  By  the  analysis  of  a  circuit,  we  mean  a
study  of  the  behavior  of  the  circuit:  How  does  it  respond  to  a  given
input?  How  do  the  interconnected  elements  and  devices  in  the  circuit
interact?
