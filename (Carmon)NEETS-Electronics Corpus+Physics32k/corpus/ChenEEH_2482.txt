Grating Lobes
In general, depending on the spacing d, there can be more than
one value of n for which one can ﬁnd a solution for umax. The
radiation lobe corresponding to n ¼ 0 is called the main lobe,
whereas all other lobes corresponding to all n other than n ¼ 0
are called the grating lobes (borrowing the name from a
similar situation in the study of periodic gratings). For the
main-lobe radiation:
