PULSE CHARACTERISTICS are the make up of the high-voltage modulator pulse that is applied to
the magnetron. The pulse should have a steep leading edge, a flat top, and a steep trailing edge. If the
leading edge is not steep, the magnetron may begin to oscillate before the pulse reaches its maximum
level. Since these low-power oscillations will occur in a different mode, the mode of the magnetron will
be shifted as the pulse reaches maximum power. This mode shifting will result in an undesirable
magnetron output. For the same reason (to prevent mode shifting), the top of the modulator pulse should
be as flat as possible. Variations in the applied operating power will cause variations in the mode of
operation. The trailing edge of the pulse should also be steep for the same reason--to prevent mode
shifting.
