One approach has been to adopt large area LCDs (which pose a signiﬁcant engineering challenge) as
the primary imaging device. However, these devices do not inherently emit light and would be useless
in  the  dark  without  backlights.  The  light  source  of  choice  for  this  approach  has  been  cold  cathode
ﬂuorescent lamps, which are commonly applied in today’s laptop computers.
