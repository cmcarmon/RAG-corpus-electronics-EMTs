signal S with a cycle time of T such as that shown in Figure 11.2 controls the
switch, so that the switch is closed for an interval T1, then open for an inter-
val T2, and so on. When the switch is closed, the voltage source charges up
the capacitor. The capacitor discharges through resistor R2 when the switch is
open. We will be particularly interested in the special case where the T1 and
T2 intervals are large enough that the capacitor voltages during each of the
intervals T1 and T2 reach their respective steady state values.
