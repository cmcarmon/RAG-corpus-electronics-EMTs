The direction a gyro will precess also depends on the direction the gyro is spinning. Precession is 
actually the result of two forces: angular momentum (spinning force) and the applied force (torque). The 
direction of precession is always offset from the direction of the applied force. The offset is always in the 
direction of rotor spin.
