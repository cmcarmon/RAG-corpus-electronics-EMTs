conditions for oscillation are: 
 (a) the feedback  must be positive (i.e. the signal 
fed back must arrive back in-phase with the signal 
at the input);  
 (b) the overall loop voltage gain must be greater 
than 1 (i.e. the amplifier’s gain  must be sufficient 
to  overcome 
losses  associated  with  any 
frequency selective feedback network).  
  Hence, to create an oscillator we simply need an 
amplifier  with  sufficient  gain  to  overcome  the 
losses  of 
that  provide  positive 
feedback.  Assuming  that  the  amplifier  provides 
180°  phase  shift,  the  frequency  of  oscillation  will 
be  that  at  which  there  is  180°  phase  shift  in  the 
feedback network.  
 A number of circuits can be used to provide 180° 
phase shift, one of the simplest being a three-stage 
C–R ladder  network  that  we  shall  meet  next. 
Alternatively,  if  the  amplifier  produces  0°  phase 
shift,  the  circuit  will  oscillate  at  the  frequency  at 
which  the  feedback  network  produces  0°  phase 
shift.  In  both  cases,  the  essential  point  is  that  the 
feedback  should  be  positive  so  that  the  output 
signal arrives back at the input in such a sense as to 
reinforce the original signal.
