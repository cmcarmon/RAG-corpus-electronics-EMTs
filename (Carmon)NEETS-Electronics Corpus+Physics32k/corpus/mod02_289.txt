Assume that 10 ohms inductive reactance and 20 ohms capacitive reactance are connected in series 
with 40 ohms resistance. Let the horizontal line represent the resistance R. The line drawn upward from 
the end of R, represents the inductive reactance, XL. Represent the capacitive reactance by a line drawn 
downward at right angles from the same end of R. The resultant of XL and XC is found by subtracting XL 
from XC. This resultant represents the value of X.
