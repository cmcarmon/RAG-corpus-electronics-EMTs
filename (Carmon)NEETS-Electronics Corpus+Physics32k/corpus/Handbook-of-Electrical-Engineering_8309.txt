circuits  is  much  harder  to  achieve  compared  to  the  testing  of  combinational  circuits.  Computer  programs,
called automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) programs, have been developed for generating test patterns
for  combinational  or  sequential  circuits.  By  far,  the  generation  of  test  patterns  for  combinational  circuits  is
better understood and automated than doing the same for sequential circuits.
