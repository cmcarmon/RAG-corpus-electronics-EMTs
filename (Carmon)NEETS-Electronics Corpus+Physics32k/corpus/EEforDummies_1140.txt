If your meter has a continuity setting, don’t use it to zero‐adjust (calibrate) 
the meter. The tone may sound when the meter reads a few ohms, so it 
doesn’t give you the accuracy you need. Recalibrate the multimeter using the 
ohms setting, and not the continuity setting, to ensure proper operation.
