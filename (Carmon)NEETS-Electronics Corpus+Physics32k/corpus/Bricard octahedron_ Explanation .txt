The quadrilaterals formed by the edges between the points in any two symmetric pairs of points can be thought of as equators of the octahedron. These equators have the property (by their symmetry) that opposite pairs of quadrilateral sides have equal length. Every quadrilateral with opposite pairs of equal sides, embedded in Euclidean space, has axial symmetry, and some (such as the rectangle) have other symmetries besides. If one cuts the Bricard octahedron into two open-bottomed pyramids by slicing it along one of its equators, both of these open pyramids can flex, and the flexing motion can be made to preserve the axis of symmetry of the whole shape. But, by the symmetries of its construction, the flexing motions of these two open pyramids both move the equator along which they were cut in the same way. Therefore, they can be glued back together into a single flexing motion of the whole octahedron.
The property of having opposite sides of equal length is true of the rectangle, parallelogram, and antiparallelogram, and it is possible to construct Bricard octahedra having any of those flat shapes as their equators. However, the equator of a Bricard octahedron is not required to lie in a plane; instead, it can be a skew quadrilateral. Even for Bricard octahedra constructed to have a flat equator, the equator generally does not remain flat as the octahedron flexes. However, for some Bricard octahedra, such as the octahedron with an antiparallelogram equator shown in the illustration, the symmetries of the polyhedron cause its equator to remain planar at all times.
