The positive clamper circuit is self-adjusting. This means that the bottom of the output waveform 
remains clamped at 0 volts during changes in input signal amplitude. Also, the output wave shape retains 
the form and peak-to-peak amplitude (50 volts in this case) of the input wave shape. When the input 
amplitude becomes greater, the charge of the capacitor becomes greater and the output amplitude 
becomes larger. When the input amplitude decreases, the capacitor does not charge as high as before and 
clamping occurs at a lower output voltage. The capacitor charge, therefore, changes with signal strength.
