If the permittivity e is not a function of frequency (true for a
vacuum and often approximately true for nonconducting media
over a certain frequency range), then the phase velocity is con-
stant with frequency (the plane wave propagates without disper-
sion). For a vacuum, the phase velocity is c ¼ 2:99792458
108 m=sec. The group velocity (velocity of energy ﬂow and
often a good approximation to the velocity of signal propagation
[Collin, 1991], is given by:
