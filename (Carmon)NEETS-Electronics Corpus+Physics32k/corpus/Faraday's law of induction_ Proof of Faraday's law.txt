The four Maxwell's equations (including the Maxwell–Faraday equation), along with the Lorentz force law, are a sufficient foundation to derive everything in classical electromagnetism. Therefore, it is possible to "prove" Faraday's law starting with these equations.
The starting point is the time-derivative of flux through an arbitrary, possibly moving surface in space Σ:

{\displaystyle {\frac {d\Phi _{B}}{dt}}={\frac {d}{dt}}\int _{\Sigma (t)}\mathbf {B} (t)\cdot d\mathbf {A} }

(by definition). This total time derivative can be evaluated and simplified with the help of the Maxwell–Faraday equation, Gauss's law for magnetism, and some vector calculus; the details are in the box below:

the result is:

{\displaystyle {\frac {d\Phi _{B}}{dt}}=-\oint _{\partial \Sigma }\left(\mathbf {E} +\mathbf {v} _{\mathbf {l} }\times \mathbf {B} \right)\cdot d\mathbf {l} .}

where ∂Σ is the boundary of the surface Σ, and vl is the velocity of that boundary.
While this equation is true for any arbitrary moving surface Σ in space, it can be simplified further in the special case that ∂Σ is a loop of wire. In this case, we can relate the right-hand-side to EMF. Specifically, EMF is defined as the energy available per unit charge that travels once around the loop. Therefore, by the Lorentz force law,
