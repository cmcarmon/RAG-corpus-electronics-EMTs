The original Langevin equation describes Brownian motion, the apparently random movement of a particle in a fluid due to collisions with the molecules of the fluid,

The degree of freedom of interest here is the position

{\displaystyle \mathbf {x} }
of the particle,



m


{\displaystyle m}
denotes the particle's mass. The force acting on the particle is written as a sum of a viscous force proportional to the particle's velocity (Stokes' law), and a noise term

. The δ-function form of the correlations in time means that the force at a time



t


{\displaystyle t}
is assumed to be completely uncorrelated with it at any other time. This is an approximation; the actual random force has a nonzero correlation time corresponding to the collision time of the molecules. However, the Langevin equation is used to describe the motion of a "macroscopic" particle at a much longer time scale, and in this limit the



δ


{\displaystyle \delta }
-correlation and the Langevin equation become exact.
Another prototypical feature of the Langevin equation is the occurrence of the damping coefficient



λ


{\displaystyle \lambda }
in the correlation function of the random force, a fact also known as Einstein relation.
