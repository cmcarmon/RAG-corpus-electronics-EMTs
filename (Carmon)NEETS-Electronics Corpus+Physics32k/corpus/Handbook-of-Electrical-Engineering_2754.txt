As the interconnection delays have become increasingly dominant, the design process has evolved into an
iterative  process  through  the  design  steps,  as  illustrated  by  the  back-and-forward  annotation  arrows  in
Fig. 25.24(a). Initial estimates of delays in step B need to be reﬁned through back-annotation of interconnection
delay parameters obtained after ﬂoorplanning and/or after placement and routing to reﬂect the actual inter-
connection characteristics, perhaps requiring changes in the initial speciﬁcation of the desired function in terms
of logical and physical blocks. This iterative process moving between the logical design and the physical design
of an ASIC has been problematic since often the logical design is performed by the company developing the
ASIC, whereas the physical design is performed by the company (the “foundry”) fabricating the ASIC. CAD
tools are an important vehicle for coordination of the interface between the designer and the foundry.
