Nonnegative Sequence Approximation
Two related fundamental problems which arise in various signal processing applications are that of ﬁnding (1)
a  nonnegative-deﬁnite  sequence  which  lies  closest  to  a  given  sequence,  or  (2)  a  nonnegative-deﬁnite  matrix
which lies closest to a given matrix. For example, in many commonly employed spectral estimation algorithms,
estimates of a time series autocorrelation sequence are either explicitly or implicitly computed from a ﬁnite-
length  sample  of  the  time  series.  It  is  well  known  that  the  autocorrelation  sequence  associated  with  a  wide-
sense stationary time series has a nonnegative-deﬁnite Fourier transform. However, the process of forming the
autocorrelation lag estimates from empirical data often results in lag estimates whose Fourier transform can
be negative. With this application (and others) in mind, we will now brieﬂy explore some basic theory related
to nonnegative-deﬁnite sequences and then employ the signal restoration algorithm to solve the second problem
posed above.
