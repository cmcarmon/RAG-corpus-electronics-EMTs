The large schematic in figure 3-7 shows four separate wires brought out from the A and B stator
windings. This is the same as in figure 3-6. Notice, however, that the dotted wire now connects one end of
B1 to one end of A2. The effect of making this connection is to provide a new output voltage. This sine-
wave voltage, C in the picture, is larger than either A or B. It is the result of adding the instantaneous
values of phase A and phase B. For this reason it appears exactly half way between A and B. Therefore, C
must lag A by 45ยบ  and lead B by 45ยบ , as shown in the small vector diagram.
