with applied voltage and temperature [as is apparent from the nature of Eqs. (55.12) and (55.13)]. The exact
frequency  value  at  which  the  space  charge  loss  exhibits  its  maximum  is  contingent  upon  the  value  of  the
relaxation time t. Figure 55.4 depicts typical tand versus applied voltage characteristics for an oil-impregnated
paper-insulated cable model at two different temperatures, in which the loss behavior is primarily governed by
ionic conduction and space charge effects. The monotonically rising dissipation factor with increasing applied
voltage at room temperature is indicative of the predominating ionic loss mechanism, while at 85(cid:176)C, an incipient
decrease in tand is suggestive of space charge effects.
