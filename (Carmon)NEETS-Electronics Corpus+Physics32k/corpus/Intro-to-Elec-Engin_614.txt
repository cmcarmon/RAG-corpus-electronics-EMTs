However, they suffer from a major problem in
that their contacts do not close immediately but
continue to make and break for some time after. To
avoid such an undesirable state (because it causes
the logic state of the circuit to ï¬‚uctuate), an SRFF
is placed between the switch and the circuit, as
shown in Figure P6.1.50. Explain the operation
as a buffer.
