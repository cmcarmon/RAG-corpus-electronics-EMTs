The fundamental model for speech indicates how engineers use the physics underlying the signal gen-
eration process and exploit its structure to produce a systems model that suppresses the physics while
emphasizing how the signal is “constructed.” From everyday life, we know that speech contains a wealth of
information. We want to determine how to transmit and receive it. Eﬃcient and eﬀective speech transmis-
sion requires us to know the signal’s properties and its structure (as expressed by the fundamental model of
speech production). We see from Figure 4.17, for example, that speech contains signiﬁcant energy from zero
frequency up to around 5 kHz.
