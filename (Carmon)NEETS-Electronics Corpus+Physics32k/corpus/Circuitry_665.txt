test leads are connected to the ‘+’ and ‘O’ sockets 
respectively. Before making any measurements it is 
absolutely  essential  to  zero  the  meter.  This  is 
achieved  by  shorting  the  test  leads  together  and 
adjusting  the  ZERO  ADJ  control  until  the  meter 
reads  full-scale  (i.e.,  zero  on  the  ohms  scale).  In 
Fig.  14.14,  the  range  selector  is  set  to  OHM,  ×1. 
The pointer is reading  mid-way between 0 and 10 
and the resistance indicated is approximately 5 G
