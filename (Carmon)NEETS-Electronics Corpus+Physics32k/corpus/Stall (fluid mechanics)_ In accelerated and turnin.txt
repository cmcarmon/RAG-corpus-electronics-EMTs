The normal stall speed, specified by the VS values above, always refers to straight and level flight, where the load factor is equal to 1g. However, if the aircraft is turning or pulling up from a dive, additional lift is required to provide the vertical or lateral acceleration, and so the stall speed is higher. An accelerated stall is a stall that occurs under such conditions.
Considering, for example, a banked turn, the lift required is equal to the weight of the aircraft plus extra lift to provide the centripetal force necessary to perform the turn; that is:




L
=
n
W


{\displaystyle L=nW}

where:




L


{\displaystyle L}
= lift




n


{\displaystyle n}
= load factor (greater than 1 in a turn)




W


{\displaystyle W}
= weight of the aircraft
To achieve the extra lift, the lift coefficient, and so the angle of attack, will have to be higher than it would be in straight and level flight at the same speed. Therefore, given that the stall always occurs at the same critical angle of attack, by increasing the load factor (e.g., by tightening the turn) such critical angle – and the stall – will be reached with the airspeed remaining well above the normal stall speed, that is:





V

s
t


=

V

s




n




{\displaystyle V_{st}=V_{s}{\sqrt {n}}}

where:





V

s
t




{\displaystyle V_{st}}
= stall speed





V

s




{\displaystyle V_{s}}
= stall speed of the aircraft in straight, level flight




n


{\displaystyle n}
= load factor
The table that follows gives some examples of the relation between the angle of bank and the square root of the load factor. It derives from the trigonometric relation (secant) between



L


{\displaystyle L}
and



W


{\displaystyle W}
.

For example, in a turn with bank angle of 45°, Vst is 19% higher than Vs.
It should be noted that, according to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) terminology, the above example illustrates a so-called turning flight stall, while the term accelerated is used to indicate an accelerated turning stall only, that is, a turning flight stall where the airspeed decreases at a given rate.
A notable example of air accident involving a low-altitude turning flight stall is the 1994 Fairchild Air Force Base B-52 crash.
