As  you  work  with  solderless  breadboards, 
you  may  encounter  the  fairly  common  prob-
lem of stray capacitance, which is unwanted 
capacitance (stored electrical energy) in a cir-
cuit. All circuits have an inherent capacitance 
that canâ€™t be avoided, but when lots of wires 
are going every which way, the capacitance 
can unexpectedly increase. At a certain point 
(and it differs from one circuit to the next), this 
stray  capacitance  can  cause  the  circuit  to 
 misbehave.
Because solderless breadboards contain strips 
of metal and require somewhat longer compo-
nent leads, they tend to introduce a fair amount 
of stray capacitance into unsuspecting circuits. 
As a result, solderless breadboards have a ten-
dency to change the characteristics of some
