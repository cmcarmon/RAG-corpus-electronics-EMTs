The operation of the circuit to this point has generated a very steep leading edge for the output pulse. 
Figure 3-34 shows the idealized collector and base waveforms. Once the base of Q1 (figure 3-33) 
becomes saturated, the current increase in L1 is determined by the time constant of L1 and the total series 
resistance. From T0 to T1 in figure 3-34 the current increase (not shown) is approximately linear. The 
voltage across L1 will be a constant value as long as the current increase through L1 is linear.
