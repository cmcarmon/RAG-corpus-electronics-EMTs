There can be great variations in the strength of the radio signal received because of variations in distance
between transmitter and receiver or because of the interposition of metallic objects. In industrial radio telemetry
transmission, these effects are prevented from disturbing the data by resorting to FM of both the subcarrier
and the carrier so that the telemetered signal is unchanged by undesirable amplitude variations. This method
is called FM/FM telemetry. There are other methods of carrier modulation, such as pulse amplitude modulation,
phase modulation, and pulse duration modulation. Each has its proper place in missile and space telemetry,
where great distances must be spanned with a maximum of data over crowded and often noisy communication
channels.  Pulse  code  modulation  of  an  FM  link,  however,  may  be  expected  to  become  more  widespread  in
industrial telemetry.
