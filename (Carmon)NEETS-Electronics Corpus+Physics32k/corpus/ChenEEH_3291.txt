Simple Example of a Power Flow Problem
Let us consider a single generator delivering the load P þ jQ
through the transmission line with the reactance x. The gener-
ator bus voltage is assumed to be at the rated voltage, and it is at
1 per unit (pu). The generator bus angle is deﬁned as the phasor
reference, and hence, the generator bus voltage phase angle is set
to be zero. The load bus voltage has magnitude V and phase
angle d. Because the line has been assumed to be lossless, note
that the generator real power output must be equal to the real
