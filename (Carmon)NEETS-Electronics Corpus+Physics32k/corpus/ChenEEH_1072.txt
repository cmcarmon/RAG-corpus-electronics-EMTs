Many micro electro mechanical systems (MEMS) devices are
now on the market. They are available for use as components
in diverse systems with many applications. Some MEMS
devices are used primarily for their planned employment.
Systems of micromirrors for transmitting and displaying infor-
mation are examples. Other MEMS components are Ô¨Ånding
opportunistic applications in the hands of creative system
engineers. Pressure sensors and accelerometers are prime
examples. MEMS are already important devices in several
major industries. Both the variety of available mechanical
microdevices and their applications will grow rapidly in the
foreseeable future.
