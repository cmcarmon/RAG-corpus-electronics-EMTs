Units of length, along with mass (or weight) and time, are one of the earliest quantities that was measured by man. Historically two distinct approaches were used - one was to use a naturally occurring phenomenon such as a particular seed or part of the human body, the other was to use a standard length that was held by a community leader.
Natural units - barleycorn, feet
Regal units - measures held by ruler
Using speed of light
An example of a modern realisation is the realisation of the meter in terms of optical frequency standards.
