Thus the time constant associated with the passive elements alone is multiplied
by the gain of the Op Amp. This is often referred to as the Miller Effect, originally
in reference to the fact that a small input to output capacitance in early vacuum
tubes seriously limited the frequency response of amplifier circuits. The time
constant can be made very large for modest component values. For example, if
the RC time constant is 1 second, and A is 105 or greater, the effective circuit
time constant in measured in days. On this time scale almost any waveform
lasting for less than a minute or so will seem like a ‘‘short pulse.’’ Thus the
analysis of Section 10.6.3 is applicable, and on the time scale of minutes, the
circuit acts like an integrator.
