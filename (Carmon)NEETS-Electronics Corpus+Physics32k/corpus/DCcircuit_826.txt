The top (horizontal) coil of wire measures load current while the bottom (vertical) coil mea-
sures load voltage. Just like the lightweight moving coils of voltmeter movements, the (moving)
voltage coil of a dynamometer is typically connected in series with a range resistor so that full
load voltage is not applied to it. Likewise, the (stationary) current coil of a dynamometer may
have precision shunt resistors to divide the load current around it. With custom-built dy-
namometer movements, shunt resistors are less likely to be needed because the stationary coil
can be constructed with as heavy of wire as needed without impacting meter response, unlike
the moving coil which must be constructed of lightweight wire for minimum inertia.
