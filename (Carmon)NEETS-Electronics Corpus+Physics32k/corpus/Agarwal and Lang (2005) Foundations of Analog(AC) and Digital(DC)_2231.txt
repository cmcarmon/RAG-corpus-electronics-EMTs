and Vb.
Solve for Vo/Vi using the results in (a), and noting that Vo = Vb.
c) Assuming the circuit is under-damped, sketch the magnitude of the transfer function
|Vo/Vi| versus frequency. Indicate the frequency at which the peak occurs, the
magnitude of the transfer function at the peak, and the Q of the resonance.
