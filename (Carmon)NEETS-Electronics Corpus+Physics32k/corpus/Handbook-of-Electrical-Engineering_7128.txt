The ratio of received carrier power to noise power c/n, and its corresponding decibel value (C/N) = 10log(c/n)
dB is the primary measure of link quality. The product of transmit power pt (W) and the transmit antenna
gain gt, or equivalently, Pt (dBW) + Gt [(dBi), that is, gain expressed in decibels relative to an isotropic antenna]
is  called  the  equivalent  isotropically  radiated  power  (EIRP)  and  its  unit  is  dBW  because  the  antenna  gain  is
dimensionless. The antenna gain is that in the direction of the link, i.e., it is not necessarily the antenna’s peak
gain. The received thermal noise power is n = kTB W where k = 1.38 · 10–23 J/K is Boltzmann’s constant and
10 log(k) = –228.6 dBW/K/Hz. T is the system noise temperature in kelvins (K) and B is the bandwidth in dB
Hz. Then, G – 101logT dB/K is a ﬁgure of merit for the receiving system. It is usually written as G/T and read
as “gee over tee”. The antenna gain and the noise temperature must be deﬁned at the same reference point, e.g.,
at the receiver’s input port or at the antenna terminals.
