In a network consisting of one or more energy sources and one or more circuit elements,
the cause-and-effect relationship in circuit theory can be studied utilizing Kirchhoffâ€™s laws and
volt-ampere relationships of the circuit elements. While the cause is usually the voltage or current
source exciting the circuit, the effect is the voltages and currents existing in various parts of
the network.
