At Texas Instruments, Jack Kilby was assigned in 
the summer of 1958 to develop a smaller electrical 
circuit. His idea evolved to fabricating all the compo-
nents and the chip out of the same block (monolith) 
of semiconductor material. In September 1958, he 
constructed the first integrated circuit, and it worked 
perfectly. Making all the parts out of the same block 
of material and adding the metal needed to connect 
them as a top layer resulted in not needing individual 
discrete components and wires. The circuits could be 
made smaller, and the manufacturing process could 
be automated. Jack Kilby is probably most famous for  
his invention of the integrated circuit, for which he  
received the Nobel Prize in Physics in the year 2000.
