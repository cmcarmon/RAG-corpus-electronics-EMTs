Solar  cells  utilize  the  pn-junction  to  convert  light  energy  into  electrical  energy.  Hole–electron  pairs  are
generated in the semiconductor material by light photons. The carriers are separated by the high electric ﬁeld
in  the  depletion  region  across  the  pn-junction.The  electric  ﬁeld  forces  the  holes  into  the  p region  and  the
electrons into the n region. This displacement of mobile charges creates a voltage difference between the two
semiconductor regions. Electric power is generated in an external load connected between the terminals to the
p and n regions. The conversion efﬁciency is relatively low, around 10 to 12%. With the use of new materials,
an efﬁciency of about 30% has been reported. Efﬁciency up to 45% was achieved by using monochromatic light.
