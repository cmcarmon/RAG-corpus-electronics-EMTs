Hardware support provided for a virtual memory system generally includes the ability to translate the virtual
addresses provided by the processor into the physical addresses needed to access main memory. Thus, only on
a virtual address miss is the operating system invoked. An important aspect of a computer implementing virtual
memory, however, is the necessity of freezing the processor at the point where a miss occurs, servicing the page
table fault, and later returning to continue the execution as if no page fault had occurred. This requirement
means  either  that  it  must  be  possible  to  halt  execution  at  any  point—including  possibly  in  the  middle  of  a
complex instruction—or it must be possible to guarantee that all memory accesses will be to pages resident in
main memory.
