Studies in United States have shown than poor people have a greater risk of dying in a car crash than people who are well-off. Car deaths are also higher in poorer states.
Similar studies in France have shown the same results. This may be due to working-class people having less access to secure equipment in cars, having older cars which are less protected against crash, and must cover more distance to go to work each day.
