The poncelet (symbol p) is an obsolete unit of power, once used in France and replaced by cheval vapeur (cv, metric horsepower). The unit was named after Jean-Victor Poncelet.
One poncelet is defined as the power required to raise a hundred-kilogram mass (quintal) at a velocity of one metre per second (100 kilogram-forceÂ·m/s).
1 p
= 980.665 W = 11/3 cv (metric hp) = 1.315 hp (traditional horsepower)
