The Hamming distance is used to define some essential notions in coding theory, such as error detecting and error correcting codes. In particular, a code C is said to be k-errors detecting if any two codewords c1 and c2 from C that have a Hamming distance less than k coincide; otherwise, a code is k-errors detecting if, and only if, the minimum Hamming distance between any two of its codewords is at least k+1.
A code C is said to be k-errors correcting if, for every word w in the underlying Hamming space H, there exists at most one codeword c (from C) such that the Hamming distance between w and c is less than k. In other words, a code is k-errors correcting if, and only if, the minimum Hamming distance between any two of its codewords is at least 2k+1. This is more easily understood geometrically as any closed balls of radius k centered on distinct codewords being disjoint. These balls are also called Hamming spheres in this context.
Thus a code with minimum Hamming distance d between its codewords can detect at most d-1 errors and can correct ⌊(d-1)/2⌋ errors. The latter number is also called the packing radius or the error-correcting capability of the code.
