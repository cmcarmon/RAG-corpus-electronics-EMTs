The connection into the ground requires a specially designed ground electrode (or earth electrode). The electrode is usually located several tens of kilometres from the converter station in order to avoid possible problems or corrosion in the converter station grounding system. The electrode line connects the converter station to the grounding electrode. The electrode line can be implemented, depending upon the situation of the electrode (onshore or in the sea), as ground cables, as overhead line, or as a combination of ground cable and overhead line.
