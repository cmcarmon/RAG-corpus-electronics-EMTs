P systems usually involves carefully tailored code to control signals that interact with
the processor chip. Usually the functions that are required of the processor are time-critical real-time control
actions. Programs for such applications can easily become highly intricate and require detailed knowledge of all
the functions of the processor chip. For a discussion of these problems, see Chapters 3 and 4 of Peatman [1988].
