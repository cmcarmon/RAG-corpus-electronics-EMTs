Application of Tellegen’s Theorem to Complex Power
An example of two topologically equivalent networks was shown in Fig. 3.20. Let us now specify that two such
networks  are  linear,  all  sources  are  same-frequency  sinusoids,  they  are  operating  in  the  steady  state,  and  all
variables are phasors. Furthermore, suppose the two networks are the same, except that the sources of network b
have  phasors  that  are  the  complex  conjugates  of  those  of  network a.  Then,  if V  and  I  denote  the  vectors  of
branch voltages and currents of network a, Tellegen’s theorem in Eq. (3.3) becomes:
