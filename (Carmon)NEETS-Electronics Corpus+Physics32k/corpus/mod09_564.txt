View (A) of figure 4-19 illustrates the circuit of a positive clamper with positive bias. It can be 
identified as a positive clamper because the cathode of the diode is connected to the capacitor. Positive 
bias can be observed by noting that the negative side of the battery is connected to ground. The purposes 
and actions of the capacitor, resistor, and diode are the same as in the unbiased clamper circuit just 
discussed.
