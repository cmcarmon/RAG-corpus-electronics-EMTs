Unbalances
Unbalance describes a situation, as shown in Fig. 62.11, in which the voltages of a three-phase voltage source
are not identical in magnitude, or the phase differences between them are not 120 electrical degrees, or both.
It affects motors and other devices that depend on a well-balanced three-phase voltage source.
