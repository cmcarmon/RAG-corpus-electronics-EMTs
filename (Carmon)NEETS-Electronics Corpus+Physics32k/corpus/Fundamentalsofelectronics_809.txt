Enforcing the signal amplitude speciﬁcation means that as the signal’s bandwidth increases we must de-
crease the spectral amplitude, with the result that the signal power remains constant. Thus, increasing
signal bandwidth does indeed decrease the signal-to-noise ratio of the receiver’s output.
• Increasing channel attenuation — moving the receiver farther from the transmitter — decreases the
signal-to-noise ratio as the square. Thus, signal-to-noise ratio decreases as distance-squared between
transmitter and receiver.
