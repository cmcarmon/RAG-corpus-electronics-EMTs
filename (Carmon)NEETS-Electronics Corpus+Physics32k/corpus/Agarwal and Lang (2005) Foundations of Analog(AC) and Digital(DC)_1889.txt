is much more revealing. The corresponding phase graph is also plotted on a log scale.
Notice the interesting frequency related behavior of the magnitude and phase plots in
Figure 13.13. The log plot instantly reveals that high frequencies are severely attenuated
while low frequencies are passed through unattenuated. We will have much more to
say about this variable frequency view of responses in Section 13.4.
