A complete antenna system consists of three parts: (1) The COUPLING DEVICE, (2) the FEEDER, 
and (3) the ANTENNA, as shown in figure 4-2. The coupling device (coupling coil) connects the 
transmitter to the feeder. The feeder is a transmission line that carries energy to the antenna. The antenna 
radiates this energy into space.
