The power system load is continually undergoing changes as
individual loads ï¬‚uctuate while others are energized or de-
energized. Generation must precisely match these changes to
maintain system frequency, a function called load frequency
control (LFC), and at the same time must follow an appropri-
ate economic dispatch of the units as discussed in the previous
section. Together, these functions are referred to as automatic
generation control (AGC). Accordingly, all modern power
systems have centralized control centers that run software
called Energy Management Systems (EMS) that, in addition
to other functions, monitor frequency and generator outputs.
Units that are on AGC will receive raise and lower signals to
adjust their set points.
