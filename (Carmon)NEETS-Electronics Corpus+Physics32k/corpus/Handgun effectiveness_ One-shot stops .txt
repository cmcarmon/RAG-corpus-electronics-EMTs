The only scientifically proven and biologically possible way to guarantee instant incapacitation is through destruction of the central nervous system or brain. This will usually cease all motor-related and voluntary actions. If the central nervous system is not damaged or destroyed, there will be no immediate incapacitation. To allow room for error, since a central nervous system hit is very unlikely, most people use expanding ammunition. This will increase the odds of striking a part of the central nervous system, and cause faster blood loss.
For example, a popular caliber in the United States is the .45 ACP. It is the largest practical handgun caliber in use, featuring a bullet that is .452 inches in diameter. With well made expanding ammunition, a .452 bullet often expands to .70 caliber or larger. With a 9 mm Luger bullet, for example, its normal .355 diameter might be hoped to expand to .50 caliber or larger. This could give a preference for larger caliber bullets, as they do not rely on expansion as much as smaller caliber bullets do to provide incapacitation. However, multiple tests and actual data from shootings have not found this to be true.
The most popular round in the United States is the 9 mm Luger. The variety of handguns and ammunition available for this round is much higher than any other caliber. The amount of energy delivered to a body is dependent on both the weight of the bullet and its velocity as basic physics dictates. Thus NATO prefers the 9 mm Luger parabellum to a larger but slower round such as the .45 ACP.
Bullet expansion in handguns is desirable not solely for incapacitation, but also so the bullet will not exit the target. An expanding bullet will stop in the target and "dump" all its energy there, rather than overpenetrating and possibly endangering people behind the target. Since all handgun rounds are marginal at best, the one with the most energy and which expends all that energy in a target is the one that is most effective.
