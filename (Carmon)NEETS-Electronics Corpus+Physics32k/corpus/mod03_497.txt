by such factors as contact size, contact material, and contact spacing. There are two basic parts to a switch
rating-the current and voltage rating. For example, a switch may be rated at 250 volts dc, 10 amperes.
Some switches have more than one rating. For example, a single switch may be rated at 250 volts dc, 10
amperes; 500 volts ac, 10 amperes; and 28 volts dc, 20 amperes. This rating indicates a current rating that
depends upon the voltage applied.
