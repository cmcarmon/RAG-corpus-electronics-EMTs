Millimeter-Wave Seeker for Terminal Guidance Missile
Terminal guidance for short-range (less than 2 km) air-to-surface missiles has seen extensive development in
the last decade. Targets such as tanks are frequently immersed in a clutter background which may give a radar
return that is comparable to that of the target. To reduce the clutter return in the antenna footprint, the antenna
beamwidth  is  reduced  by  going  to  millimeter  wavelengths.  For  a  variety  of  reasons  the  choice  is  usually  a
frequency near 35 or 90 GHz. Antenna beamwidth is inversely proportional to frequency, so in order to get a
reduced beamwidth we would normally choose 90 GHz; however, more deleterious effects at 90 GHz due to
atmospheric absorption and scattering can modify that choice. In spite of small beamwidths, the clutter is a
signiÔ¨Åcant  problem,  and  in  most  cases  signal-to-clutter  is  a  more  limiting  condition  than  signal-to-noise  in
determining range performance. Piper [1987] has done an excellent job of analyzing the situation for 35- and
90-GHz pulse radar seekers and comparing those with a 90-GHz FM/CW seeker. His FM/CW results will be
summarized below.
