{\displaystyle d(x,y)=\lVert y-x\rVert }
, see also metrics on vector spaces. (If such a space is complete, we call it a Banach space.) Examples:
The Manhattan norm gives rise to the Manhattan distance, where the distance between any two points, or vectors, is the sum of the differences between corresponding coordinates.
The maximum norm gives rise to the Chebyshev distance or chessboard distance, the minimal number of moves a chess king would take to travel from



x


{\displaystyle x}
to



y


{\displaystyle y}
.

If



(
M
,
d
)


{\displaystyle (M,d)}
is a metric space and



X


{\displaystyle X}
is a subset of



M


{\displaystyle M}
, then



(

{\displaystyle (X,d)}
becomes a metric space by restricting the domain of



d

The discrete metric, where



d

=
0


{\displaystyle d(x,y)=0}
if



x
=
y


{\displaystyle x=y}
and



d

x
,
y
)
=
1


{\displaystyle d(x,y)=1}
otherwise, is a simple but important example, and can be applied to all sets. This, in particular, shows that for any set, there is always a metric space associated to it. Using this metric, any point is an open ball, and therefore every subset is open and the space has the discrete topology.
A finite metric space is a metric space having a finite number of points. Not every finite metric space can be isometrically embedded in a Euclidean space.
The hyperbolic plane is a metric space. More generally:
If



M


{\displaystyle M}

If



X


{\displaystyle X}
is some set and



M


{\displaystyle M}
is a metric space, then, the set of all bounded functions



f

f


{\displaystyle f}

g


{\displaystyle g}

sup


{\displaystyle \sup }
is supremum). This metric is called the uniform metric or supremum metric, and If



M


{\displaystyle M}
is complete, then this function space is complete as well. If X is also a topological space, then the set of all bounded continuous functions from



X


{\displaystyle X}
to



M


{\displaystyle M}

{\displaystyle d(x,y)}

x


{\displaystyle x}
and



y


{\displaystyle y}

Graph edit distance is a measure of dissimilarity between two graphs, defined as the minimal number of graph edit operations required to transform one graph into another.
The Levenshtein distance is a measure of the dissimilarity between two strings



u


{\displaystyle u}
and



v


{\displaystyle v}
, defined as the minimal number of character deletions, insertions, or substitutions required to transform

{\displaystyle u}
into



v


{\displaystyle v}

Using T-theory, the tight span of a metric space is also a metric space. The tight span is useful in several types of analysis.
