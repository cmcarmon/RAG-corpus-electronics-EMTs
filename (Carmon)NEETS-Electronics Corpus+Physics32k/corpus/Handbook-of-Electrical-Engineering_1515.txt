The Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) framework naturally incorporates prior information into the estimation
process, which is particularly useful for dealing with problems posed by sparse training data, where ML estimates
become inaccurate. MAP parameter estimates approah the ML estimates when data is plentiful, but are governed
by the prior information in the absence of data. If l
 is the parameter vector to be estimated from the observation
O with probability density function (pdf) f(O|l ) and g is the prior pdf of l
, then the MAP estimate is deÔ¨Åned
as the maximum of the posterior pdf of l
