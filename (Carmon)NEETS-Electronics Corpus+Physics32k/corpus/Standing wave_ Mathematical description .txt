In one dimension, two waves with the same frequency, wavelength and amplitude traveling in opposite directions will interfere and produce a standing wave or stationary wave. For example: a wave traveling to the right along a taut string held stationary at its right end will reflect back in the other direction along the string, and the two waves will superpose to produce a standing wave. The reflected wave has to have the same amplitude and frequency as the incoming wave. The phenomenon can be demonstrated mathematically by deriving the equation for the sum of two oppositely moving waves:
A harmonic wave traveling to the right along the x-axis is described by the equation

where:




A



{\displaystyle A\,}
is the amplitude of the wave,




ω



{\displaystyle \omega \,}
(called the angular frequency and measured in radians per second) is 2π times the frequency (in hertz)




λ



{\displaystyle \lambda \,}
is the wavelength of the wave (in metres)




x



{\displaystyle x\,}
and



t



{\displaystyle t\,}
are variables for longitudinal position and time, respectively.
So the equation of the resultant wave y will be the sum of y1 and y2:

called the anti-nodes, the amplitude is maximum, with a value of twice the amplitude of the original waves. The distance between two consecutive nodes or anti-nodes is λ/2.
Standing waves can also occur in two- or three-dimensional resonators. With standing waves on two-dimensional membranes such as drumheads, illustrated in the animations above, the nodes become nodal lines, lines on the surface at which there is no movement, that separate regions vibrating with opposite phase. These nodal line patterns are called Chladni figures. In three-dimensional resonators, such as musical instrument sound boxes and microwave cavity resonators, there are nodal surfaces.
