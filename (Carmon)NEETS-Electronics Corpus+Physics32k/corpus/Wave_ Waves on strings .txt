The speed of a transverse wave traveling along a vibrating string ( v ) is directly proportional to the square root of the tension of the string ( T ) over the linear mass density ( μ ):

T
μ



,



{\displaystyle v={\sqrt {\frac {T}{\mu }}},\,}

where the linear density μ is the mass per unit length of the string.
