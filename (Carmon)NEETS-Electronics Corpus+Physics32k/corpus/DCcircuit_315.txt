All properly designed circuits have ”disconnect” switch mechanisms for securing voltage
from a circuit. Sometimes these ”disconnects” serve a dual purpose of automatically opening

In either case, they are there for your protection and must be used properly. Please note that
the disconnect device should be separate from the regular switch used to turn the device on
and off. It is a safety switch, to be used only for securing the system in a Zero Energy State:
