The admittance realized this way was shown in Figure 4.23(B).
Should we consider the function in equation 4.50 as an im-
pedance, similar steps would lead to the network in Figure
4.23(A). These networks have the name Foster canonical
forms. Another method, originally due to Cauer, gives imped-
ances or admittances in the form of a ladder. As an example,
consider the impedance:
