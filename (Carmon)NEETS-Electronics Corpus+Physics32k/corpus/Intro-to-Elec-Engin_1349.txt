Frequency translation can be used effectively to reduce the effect of 1/f noise by putting the
signal in a less noisy frequency band. Figure 14.3.8(a) shows the schematic implementation with
product modulation and demodulation, whereas Figure 14.3.8(b) illustrates the noise reduction in
terms of the areas under the noise power curve. The two multipliers in Figure 14.3.8(a) are normally
implemented by using a pair of synchronized switches. It turns out that the product modulation
requires bandwidth B = 2W , and the synchronized product demodulation doubles the ﬁnal SNR.
Another way of improving the SNR is by preemphasis and deemphasis ﬁltering. Generally,
for low-frequency components of the message signal FM (frequency modulation) performs better,
and for high-frequency components PM (phase modulation) is a better choice. Hence, if one can
design a system that performs FM for low-frequency components of the message signal, and
