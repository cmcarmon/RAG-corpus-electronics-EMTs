As time passed on, more accurate artillery guns were made, and they came in different varieties. Small artillery pieces were used as mortars, medium sized artillery guns became tank guns, and the largest artillery guns became long range land batteries and battleship armaments.
With the introduction of better tanks in World War II, elevation was once again a problem for tank gunners, which had to aim through the Gunner's Auxiliary Sights (GAS) or even through iron sights. Though the problem was not that evident as tanks fired rounds at a higher velocity than normal artillery, making aiming less of a hassle.
As with World War I, World War II artillery was almost like its old counterpart. But in the war came the introduction of the FCS or the fire-control system, which made firing artillery accurately easier.
With the advancements in the 21st century, it has become easy to determine how much elevation a gun needed to hit a target. The laser rangefinder is a component of FCS, and can accurately determine the range of the target, thereby calculating how much elevation the gun needs, making today's guns highly accurate.
