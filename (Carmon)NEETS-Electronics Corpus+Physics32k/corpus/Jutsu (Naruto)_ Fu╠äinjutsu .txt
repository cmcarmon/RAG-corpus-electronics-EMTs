Sealing jutsu (封印術, Fūin jutsu) are techniques developed by the Sage of the Six Paths to seal something inside objects or living beings. The developing of new sealing jutsus was continued by the Uzumaki Clan, a branch of Senju Clan who are descendants of the sage; among their works is a jutsu that seals Tailed Beasts into their Jinchuriki to be. The most common application of this is sealing weapons or other objects within scrolls to efficiently carry a large number of items. Sealing jutsu are also utilized to restrict access to things, such as chakra or entry to a building. The "Reaper Death Seal" is a unique sealing jutsu as the target's soul is sealed with the Reaper, who is neither living nor an object.
