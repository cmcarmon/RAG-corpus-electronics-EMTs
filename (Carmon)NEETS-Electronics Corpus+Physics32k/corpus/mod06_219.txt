There is one point that we should make. Ck and Rk are in parallel. You learned from previous study
that voltage in a parallel circuit is constant. Thus, it would seem impossible to have the top of Rk at one
voltage while the top plate of Ck is at another. Remember, in electronics nothing happens instantaneously.
There is always some time lag that may be measured in millionths or billionths of seconds. The action of
Ck and Rk that was just described takes place within this time lag. To clarify the explanation, the voltages
used at the components Rk and Ck were exaggerated. Long before a 10-volt differential could exist
between the tops of Rk  and Ck, Ck will act to eliminate this voltage differential.
