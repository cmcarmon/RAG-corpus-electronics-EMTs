advantage of new software technologies. The challenge is that
control systems are unique among computer applications since
they rely on hard real-time computations. Too slow of an
update rate (or an erratic update rate) means that the closed-
loop system may experience stability problems. In other com-
puter applications, such as telecommunications, slow update
rates may simply degrade performance and irritate customers
rather than destabilize the system.
