A liquid-immersed transformer consists of a magnetic core
and coil assembly immersed in a ﬂuid, normally mineral oil.
The ﬂuid must possess both good heat transfer characteristics
and electrical insulating characteristics. An advantage of a
liquid-immersed transformer is
it permits compact
design. Generally, transformers above 10 MVA and/or 34.5 kV
are liquid-ﬁlled. Since oils are ﬂammable,
liquid-immersed
transformers must be applied with adequate precautions rec-
ognizing the ﬂammability of oil. This has presented challenges
for indoor applications.
