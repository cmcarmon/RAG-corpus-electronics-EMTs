For any Keplerian orbit (elliptic, parabolic, hyperbolic, or radial), the vis-viva equation is as follows:





v

2


=
G
M

(



2
r


−


1
a



)



{\displaystyle v^{2}=GM\left({2 \over r}-{1 \over a}\right)}

where:
v is the relative speed of the two bodies
r is the distance between the two bodies
a is the semi-major axis (a > 0 for ellipses, a = ∞ or 1/a = 0 for parabolas, and a < 0 for hyperbolas)
G is the gravitational constant
M is the mass of the central body
The product of GM can also be expressed as the standard gravitational parameter using the Greek letter μ.
