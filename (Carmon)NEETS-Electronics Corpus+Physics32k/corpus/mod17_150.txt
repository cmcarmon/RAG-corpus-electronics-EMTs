The buffer serves two other purposes. One is to isolate the oscillator from the amplifier stages.
Without a buffer, changes in the amplifier caused by keying or variations in source voltage would vary
the load of the oscillator and cause it to change frequency. It may also be used as a frequency multiplier,
which is explained later in this text.
