Spirit Transformation Technique (霊化の術, Reika no Jutsu, Ghost Transformation Jutsu) allows the user's soul to materialize and leave their body, reminiscent of an "ikiryō" (生霊, literally meaning: living ghost). This is able to take possession of a target, enabling them to freely manipulate the victim's body at will or kill them. It can travel a vast distance and transfer chakra to the user's body. The only known user of this technique is Dan Katō.
