but varies from a maximum at the ends (maximum 
voltage,  minimum  current)  to  a  minimum  at  the 
centre. 
 The  dipole  aerial  has  directional  properties 
illustrated  in  Fig.  13.20.  Fig.  13.20(a)  shows  the 
radiation  pattern  of  the  aerial  in  the  plane  of  the 
antenna’s electric field whilst Fig. 13.20(b) shows 
the  radiation  pattern  in  the  plane  of  the  aerial’s 
magnetic  field.  Things  to  note  from  these  two 
diagrams are that: 
 
(a)   in the case of Fig. 13.20(a) minimum radiation 
occurs  along  the  axis  of  the  aerial  whilst  the 
 
two  zones  of  maximum  radiation  are  at  90° 
 
 
(i.e. are ‘normal to’) the dipole elements.  
(b)   in the case of Fig. 13.20(b) the aerial radiates
