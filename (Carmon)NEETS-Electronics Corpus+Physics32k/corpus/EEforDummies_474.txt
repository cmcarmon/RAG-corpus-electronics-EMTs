You can witness electromagnetic induction firsthand by using a relatively 
strong bar magnet, a length (at least 12 inches) of 22 gauge (or thinner) wire, 
a pencil, and your multimeter. Strip the insulation off the ends of the wire and 
wrap the wire in tight loops around the pencil, as shown in Figure 8-4, leaving 
the stripped ends accessible. With your multimeter set to measure milliamps, 
connect your meter leads to the wire. Youâ€™ve completed a path for current to 
flow, but because there is no power source, no current flows. Next, place the 
magnet right next to the wire. Still no current, right? Finally, move the magnet
