Notice that one node of the negative resistor shown in Fig. 29.25(b)
and  of  the  simulated  inductor  shown  in  Fig.  29.25(d)  is  grounded.
This ground is the ground of the power supplies used to bias the op
amp.  Op  amp  circuits  implementing  ﬂoating  negative  resistors  and
simulated inductors are more difﬁcult to design [Reddy, 1976]. Float-
ing  negative  resistors  and  simulated  inductors  can  be  more  easily
designed  using  an  electronic  device  called  a  current  conveyor.  The
symbol for the current conveyor is shown in Fig. 29.26. The terminal
voltages  and  currents  of  the  “second-generation”  current  conveyor
[Sedra and Smith, 1971] are represented by
