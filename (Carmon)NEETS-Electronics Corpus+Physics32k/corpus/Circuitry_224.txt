with a 500 F resistor across a 110 V 50 Hz 
 
a.c. supply. Determine the impedance of the
 
 
circuit  and  the  current  taken  from  the 
 
supply. 
4.11   A  choke  having  an  inductance  of  1  H  and 
resistance of 250 F is connected to a 220 V 
 
 
60  Hz  a.c.  supply.  Determine  the  power 
factor  of  the  choke  and  the  current  taken 
 
 
from the supply.

4.14   A  parallel  resonant  circuit  employs  a  fixed 
inductor  of  22  µH  and  a  variable  tuning 
 
capacitor.  If  the  maximum  and  minimum 
 
values of capacitance are respectively 20 pF 
 
 
and  365  pF,  determine  the  effective  tuning 
 
range for the circuit. 
4.15   A series L-C-R circuit comprises an inductor
of  15  mH  (with  negligible  resistance),  a

signal  of  15  V  at  a  frequency  of  2  kHz, 
determine  the  current  supplied  and  the 
voltage developed across the capacitor.
