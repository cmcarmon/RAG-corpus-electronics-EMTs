Following Berenger’s work, many papers appeared validating
his technique as well as applying FDTD with the PML medium.
An important advance was made by Chew and Weedon (1994),
who restated the original split-ﬁeld PML concept in a stretched-
coordinate form. Subsequently, this allowed Teixeira and Chew
(1997) to extend PML to cylindrical and spherical coordinate
systems. A second important advance was made by Sacks et al.
(1995) and Gedney (1995, 1996), who reposed the split-ﬁeld
PML as a lossy, uniaxial anisotropic medium having both mag-
netic permeability and electric permittivity tensors. The uni-
axial PML, or UPML, is intriguing because it is based on a
potentially physically realizable material formulation rather
than Berenger’s nonphysical mathematical model.
