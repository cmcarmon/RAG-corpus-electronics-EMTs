With the second method, described in more detail in Li and
Yurkovich (2000), a discrete adaptive sliding-mode control
design algorithm was presented for nonlinear systems. Feed-
forward neural networks are used to approximate the un-
known system dynamics, where system outputs and previous
control inputs are used as the inputs for the function approx-
imators, and the deÔ¨Åned sliding surface is applied to tune their
structure online using gradient methods. There are three main
advantages to the adaptive DSMC algorithm described herein:
