Lacing Conductorsâ€”The purpose of lacing conductors is to present a neat appearance and to 
facilitate tracing the conductors when alterations or repairs are required. Flat tape is preferred for lacing 
instead of round cord. Cord has a tendency to cut into the wire insulation. The amount of flat tape or 
round cord required to lace a group of conductors is about two and one-half times the length of the 
longest conductor. A lacing shuttle is useful during the lacing operation to prevent the tape or cord from 
fouling. Wires should only be twisted prior to lacing if it is required, such as for filament leads in electron 
tube amplifiers. When lacing wire bundles containing coaxial cables, use the proper flat tape and do not 
tie the bundles too tightly. Never use round cord on coaxial cable. A single lace is started with a square 
knot and at least two marling Hitches. A double lace is required for wire bundles that are 1 inch or more 
in diameter. It is started with a telephone hitch. Cable groups are bound together by use of telephone hitch
