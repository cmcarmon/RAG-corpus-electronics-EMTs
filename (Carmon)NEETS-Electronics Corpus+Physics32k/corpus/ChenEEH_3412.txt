the power system components are typically much higher than
the levels used at the input of a relay. To accommodate the
needed transformation, instrument transformers with different
ratios are used (IEEE, 1996; Ungrad, 1995). Next, a brief
discussion of the options and characteristics of most typical
instrument transformer types is given.
