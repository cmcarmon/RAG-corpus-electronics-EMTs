A mesoscale convective complex has either an area of cloud top of 100,000 km2 or greater with temperature less than or equal to -32 °C, or an area of cloud top of 50,000 km2 with temperature less than or equal to -52 °C. Size definitions must be met for 6 hours or greater. Its maximum extent is defined as when cloud shield reaches maximum area. Its eccentricity (minor axis/major axis) is greater than or equal to 0.7 at maximum extent.
