The SI base units are the building blocks of the system and all the other units are derived from them. When Maxwell first introduced the concept of a coherent system, he identified three quantities that could be used as base units: mass, length and time. Giorgi later identified the need for an electrical base unit, for which the unit of electric current was chosen for SI. Another three base units (for temperature, substance and luminous intensity) were added later.
The early metric systems defined a unit of weight as a base unit, while the SI defines an analogous unit of mass. In everyday use, these are mostly interchangeable, but in scientific contexts the difference matters. Mass, strictly the inertial mass, represents a quantity of matter. It relates the acceleration of a body to the applied force via Newton's law, F = m × a: force equals mass times acceleration. In SI units, if you apply a force of 1 N (newton) to a mass of 1 kg, it will accelerate at 1 m/s2. This is true whether the object is floating in space or in a gravity field e.g. at the Earth's surface. Weight is the force exerted on a body by a gravitational field, and hence its weight depends on the strength of the gravitational field. Weight of a 1 kg mass at the Earth's surface is m × g; mass times the acceleration due to gravity which at the earth's surface is 9.81 newtons, and at the surface of Mars is about 3.5 newtons. Weight is not an accurate base unit for precision measurement because the acceleration due to gravity is local and varies over the surface of the earth, since the earth does not have uniform density or radius in all directions. It also varies with altitude or depth (distance from earth's centre).
