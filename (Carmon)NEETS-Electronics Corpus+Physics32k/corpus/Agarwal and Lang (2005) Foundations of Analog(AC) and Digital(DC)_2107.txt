This chapter uses the Op Amp to construct more complex circuits using
its simple, abstract model. Internally, the Op Amp itself is a moderately compli-
cated circuit (see, for example, Figure 15.2) and its design is beyond the scope of
this book. Briefly, it contains an input stage not unlike the differential amplifier
