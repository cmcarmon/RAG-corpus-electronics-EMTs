These newly cooked strange quarks find their way into a multitude of different final particles that emerge as the hot quarkâ€“gluon plasma fireball breaks up, see the scheme of different processes in figure. Given the ready supply of antiquarks in the "fireball", one also finds a multitude of antimatter particles containing more than one strange quark. On the other hand, in a system involving a cascade of nucleon-nucleon collisions, multi-strange antimatter are produced less frequently considering that several relatively improbable events must occur in the same collision process. For this reason one expects that the yield of multi-strange antimatter particles produced in the presence of quark matter is enhanced compared to conventional series of reactions.
Strange quarks also bind with the heavier charm and bottom quarks which also like to bind with each other. Thus in presence of a large number of these quarks quite unusually abundant exotic particles can be produced, some of these have never been observed before. This should be the case in the forthcoming exploration at the new Large Hadron Collider at CERN of the particles that have both charm and strange quarks, and even bottom quarks as components.
