Like  the  wye-delta  transformation  we  studied  in  Chapter  2,  a
source transformation does not affect the remaining part of the circuit.
When applicable, source transformation is a powerful tool that allows
circuit manipulations to ease circuit analysis. However, we should keep
the following points in mind when dealing with source transformation.
