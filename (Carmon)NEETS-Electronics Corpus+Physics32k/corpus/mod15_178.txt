If synchros are to work properly in a system, they must be connected and aligned correctly with 
respect to each other and to the other devices with which they are used. The reference point for alignment 
of all synchro units is ELECTRICAL ZERO. The mechanical reference point for the units connected to 
the synchros depends upon the particular application of the synchro system. Whatever the application, the 
electrical and mechanical reference points must be aligned with each other. The mechanical position is 
usually set first, and then the synchro device is aligned to electrical zero.
