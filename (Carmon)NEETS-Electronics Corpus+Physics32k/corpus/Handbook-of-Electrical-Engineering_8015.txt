programs are available in most chips so that normal communication tasks can be accomplished easily; programs
for usual input/output tasks, data acquisition, timing, and program examples are distributed so that (relatively)
error-free software is available for the designers. Most of these are distributed through public-access dial-up
bulletin boards. Programming then becomes largely an adaptation of these programs to the tasks that the system
is to perform. Of course, the system task analysis and program system design are still the designerâ€™s responsi-
bilities, as is the conduct of a software validation.
