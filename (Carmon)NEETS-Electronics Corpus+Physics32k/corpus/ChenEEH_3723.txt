The sense of the Itakura distance is to measure similarity
between models, but it is based, in fact, on the measurements
of the distances from sequences to models. These measure-
ments indirectly provide the intermodel distance. Assessment
of sequence-to-model similarity is a third important class of
pattern-matching problems occurring in speech processing.
Such problems ﬁgure prominently in an array of modern
speech-processing technologies, including speech and speaker
recognition, speaker identiﬁcation, speaker veriﬁcation, lan-
guage identiﬁcation, and accent recognition (Rabiner and
Juang, 1993). In nearly every case, the model is a statistical
representation of the production of sequences associated with
that model’s class or entity (e.g., a word, a language, a speaker).
The ‘‘distance’’ between a sequence consists of some likelihood
measure that the model in question is coherent with the given
sequence. The discussion later in this chapter of speech recog-
nition using the HMM provides a prime example of this
strategy.
