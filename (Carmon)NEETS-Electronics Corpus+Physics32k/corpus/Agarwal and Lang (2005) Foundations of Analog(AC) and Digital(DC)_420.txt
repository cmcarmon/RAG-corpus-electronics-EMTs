Once all the branch voltages are known, the branch currents can readily be found from
the branch voltages and the individual element laws. For example, if the element with
the branch voltage v1 is a resistor with resistance 1 k, then its branch current i1 defined
according to associated variables is given by
i1 = v1
1 k
