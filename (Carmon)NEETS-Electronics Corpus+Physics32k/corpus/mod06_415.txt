While conventional tubes present few safety problems, beyond broken glass and the possibility of
cutting yourself, there is one precaution you must know. Namely, electron tubes are hot. The filaments of
some tubes may operate at several thousand degrees. As a result, the envelopes can become very hot.
When you work on electron tube equipment, always deenergize the equipment and allow the tubes
sufficient time to cool before you remove them. If this is impossible, use special tube pullers which the
Navy stocks for this purpose. Never attempt to remove a hot tube from its socket with your bare fingers.
