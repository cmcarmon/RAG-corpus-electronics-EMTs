FIGURE 87.5 The stack area of the 68000’s memory and the register assignments that the called subroutine sees as it is
entered at the top. The registers all hold longwords, the size of an address. In typical PC/Macintosh compilers, integers are
deﬁned as 16-bit words. Accordingly, the stack area of memory is shown as words, or half the width of a register.
