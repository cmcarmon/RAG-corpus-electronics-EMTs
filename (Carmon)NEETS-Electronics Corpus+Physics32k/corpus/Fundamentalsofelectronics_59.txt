Decomposition: The complex exponential signal can thus be written in terms of its real and
imaginary parts using Eulerâ€™s relation. Thus, sinusoidal signals can be expressed as either the real
or the imaginary part of a complex exponential signal, the choice depending on whether cosine or
sine phase is needed, or as the sum of two complex exponentials. These two decompositions are
mathematically equivalent to each other.
