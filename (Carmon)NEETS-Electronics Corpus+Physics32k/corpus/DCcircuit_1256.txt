The measure of a capacitor’s ability to store energy for a given amount of voltage drop is
called capacitance. Not surprisingly, capacitance is also a measure of the intensity of opposition
to changes in voltage (exactly how much current it will produce for a given rate of change in
voltage). Capacitance is symbolically denoted with a capital ”C,” and is measured in the unit
of the Farad, abbreviated as ”F.”
