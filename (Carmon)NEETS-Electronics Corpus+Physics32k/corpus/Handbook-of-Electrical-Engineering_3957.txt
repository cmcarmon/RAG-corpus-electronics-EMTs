Terminations
In a termination, power is absorbed by a length of lossy material at the end of a shorted piece of transmission
line [Fig. 39.5 (a) and (c)]. This type of termination is called a matched load as power is absorbed and reï¬‚ections
are very small irrespective of the characteristic impedance of the transmission line. This is generally preferred
as  the  characteristic  impedance  of  transmission  lines  varies  with  frequency,  particularly  so  for  waveguides.
When the characteristic impedance of a line does not vary much with frequency, as is the case with a coaxial
line, a simpler smaller termination can be realized by placing a resistor to ground [Fig. 39.5(b)].
