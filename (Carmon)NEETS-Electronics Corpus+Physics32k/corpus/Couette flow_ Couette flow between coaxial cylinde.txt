Couette flow between coaxial cylinders also known as Taylor-Couette flow is a flow created between two rotating infinitely long co-axial cylinders. The original problem was solved by Stokes in 1845, but Geoffrey Ingram Taylor's name was attached to the flow because he studied the stability of the flow in his famous paper in 1923. If the inner cylinder with radius

{\displaystyle \Omega _{1}}
and the outer cylinder with radius

{\displaystyle \Omega _{2}}
, then the velocity in

{\displaystyle v_{\theta }(r)=ar+{\frac {b}{r}},\qquad a={\frac {\Omega _{2}R_{2}^{2}-\Omega _{1}R_{1}^{2}}{R_{2}^{2}-R_{1}^{2}}},\quad b={\frac {(\Omega _{1}-\Omega _{2})R_{1}^{2}R_{2}^{2}}{R_{2}^{2}-R_{1}^{2}}}.}

(Note that r has replaced y in this result to reflect cylindrical rather than rectangular coordinates). It is clear from this equation that curvature effects no longer allow for constant shear in the flow domain, as shown above.
