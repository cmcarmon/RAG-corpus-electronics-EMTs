The Ô¨Årst decomposition of the complete response is in terms of the
source of the responses, while the second decomposition is in terms of
the permanency of the responses. Under certain conditions, the natural
response  and  transient  response  are  the  same.  The  same  can  be  said
about the forced response and steady-state response.
