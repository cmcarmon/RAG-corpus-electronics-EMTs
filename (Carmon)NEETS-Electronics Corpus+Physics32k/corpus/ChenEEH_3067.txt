When a transformer is energized, the amount of current that
ﬂows will depend on the amount of residual ﬂux that resides in
the core. This residual is typically between 50 and 90% of the
peak operating ﬂux. In extreme cases, the peak ﬂux in the core
upon energization will be greater than twice the peak design
limit, and, as such, the inrush current can be 3 to 40 times the
load current (Grigsby, 2001). The actual inrush experienced
depends on the point on the voltage wave during energization,
the residual ﬂux, air core inductance of the winding, and losses
of the transformer and system.
