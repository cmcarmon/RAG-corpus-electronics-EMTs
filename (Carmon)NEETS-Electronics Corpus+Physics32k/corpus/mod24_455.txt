Fiber optic data links operate reliably if fiber optic component manufacturers and end users perform
the necessary laboratory and field measurements. Manufacturers must test how component designs,
material properties, and fabrication techniques affect the performance of fiber optic components. These
tests can be categorized as design tests or quality control tests. Design tests are conducted during the
development of a component. Design tests characterize the component's performance (optical,
mechanical, and environmental) in the intended application. Once the component performance is
characterized, the manufacturer generally only conducts quality control tests. Quality control tests verify
that the parts produced are the same as the parts the design tests were conducted on. When manufacturers
ship fiber optic components, they provide quality control data detailing the results of measurements
performed during or after component fabrication.
