Just as absolute entropy serves as theoretical background for data compression, relative entropy serves as theoretical background for data differencing â€“ the absolute entropy of a set of data in this sense being the data required to reconstruct it (minimum compressed size), while the relative entropy of a target set of data, given a source set of data, is the data required to reconstruct the target given the source (minimum size of a patch).
