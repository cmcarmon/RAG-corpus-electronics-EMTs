The power amplifier of a high-power transmitter may require far more driving power than can be
supplied by an oscillator and its buffer stage. One or more low-power intermediate amplifiers are used
between the buffer and the final amplifier that feeds the antenna. The main difference between many low-
and high-power transmitters is in the number of intermediate power-amplifier stages used.
