A single stimulus received by the nerve ﬁber physiologically, or a single stimulus delivered to it electrically,
will cause all the innervated muscle ﬁbers to contract and relax; this response is called a twitch. Figure 113.10(C)
and (D) illustrates the relationship between the muscle action potential and twitch. Note that the action potential
is almost over before contraction begins and the contraction far outlasts the duration of the action potential.
