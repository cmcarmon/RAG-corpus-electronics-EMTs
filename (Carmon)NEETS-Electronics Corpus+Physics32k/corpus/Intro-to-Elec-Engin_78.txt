Maximum Power Transfer
In order to investigate the power transfer between a practical source and a load connected to it,
let us consider Figure 1.2.3, in which a constant voltage source v with a known internal resistance
RS is connected to a variable load resistance RL. Note that when RL is equal to zero, it is called
a short circuit, in which case vL becomes zero and iL is equal to v/RS. When RL approaches
inﬁnity, it is called an open circuit, in which case iL becomes zero and vL is equal to v. One is
generally interested to ﬁnd the value of the load resistance that will absorb maximum power from
the source.
