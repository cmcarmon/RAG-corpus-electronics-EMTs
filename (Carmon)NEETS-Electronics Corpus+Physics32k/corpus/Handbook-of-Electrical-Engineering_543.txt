Limiting Circuits
Figure 5.9 shows how the transfer characteristics of limiting circuits reï¬‚ect the fact that outputs are clipped at
certain  levels.  In  each  of  the  examples  shown,  note  that  the  characteristic  becomes  horizontal  at  the  output
level where clipping occurs. The horizontal line means that the output remains constant regardless of the input
level in that region. Outside of the clipping region, the transfer characteristic is simply a line whose slope equals
