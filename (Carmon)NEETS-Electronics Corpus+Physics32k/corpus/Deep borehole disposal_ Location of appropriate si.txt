Every state in the U.S. has deep rocks suitable for its own borehole repository. The required crystalline basement rocks are located far below sedimentary rock that is not very dense, far below drinking water aquifers, and far below oil and gas deposits. A single borehole would not be big enough to hold all of the nuclear waste produced by a country like the United States, and therefore a number of them might eventually exist within a single country.
