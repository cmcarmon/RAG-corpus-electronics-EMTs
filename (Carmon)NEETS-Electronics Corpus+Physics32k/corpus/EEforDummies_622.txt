 V, the diode is on, so base cur-
rent flows. If IB is small, the resistance RCE is reduced and some collector 
current, IC, flows. IC is directly proportional to IB, with a current gain, hFE, 
equal to IC/IB, and the transistor is functioning as a current amplifier â€” 
that is, operating in active mode.
