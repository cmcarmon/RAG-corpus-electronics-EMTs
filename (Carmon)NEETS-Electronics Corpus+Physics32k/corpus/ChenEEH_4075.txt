We observe that by using ﬂattop samples to generate a PAM
signal, we introduce amplitude distortion as well as a delay of
T =2. This effect is similar to the variation in transmission
frequency that is caused by the ﬁnite size of the scanning
aperture in television. The distortion caused by the use of
PAM to transmit an analog signal is called the aperture affect.
This distortion may be corrected by using an equalizer
(see Figure 2.10). The equalizer has the effect of decreasing
the in-band loss of the ﬁlter as the frequency increases in such a
manner to compensate for the aperture effect. For T =Ts  0:1,
the amplitude distortion is less than 0.5%, in which case the
need of equalization may be omitted altogether.
