A tuning fork is generally used in conjunction with the measurement of the rotational speed of a 
teletypewriter or facsimile motor but is not limited to this application. However, you must remember that 
the tuning fork can be used at only one frequency, the frequency of vibration for which it was 
manufactured, and therefore cannot be used on variable-speed motors. To use the tuning fork, you direct a 
source of light upon the point to be observed. In the case of a teletypewriter, a black-and-white segmented 
target is painted on the outer circumference of the motor governor. Radial spokes in a flywheel could be 
used equally well. Permit the motor to reach operational speed under normal load conditions; otherwise, 
the motor will slow down considerably when the normal load is applied. Strike the tuning fork against the 
side of your hand to set it into vibration. Then observe the target through the slots in the plates attached to 
the tines of the fork. The correct speed is obtained when the segments of the target appear to be 
stationary. If the segments seem to move backward, apparently against the known motor rotational 
direction, the speed is too low. If the segments seem to move forward, the speed is too high. There is also 
the possibility that the target segments will appear to jump back and forth or to disappear suddenly. Such 
erratic action is often because of governor malfunctioning. The correct speed adjustment is reached when 
the targets appear to be stationary.
