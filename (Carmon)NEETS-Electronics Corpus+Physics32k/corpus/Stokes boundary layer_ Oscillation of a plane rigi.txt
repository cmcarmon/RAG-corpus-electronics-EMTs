Harmonic motion of a plane rigid plate – moving parallel to its plane – will result in the fluid near the plate being dragged with the plate, due to the viscous shear stresses. Suppose the motion of the plate is

{\displaystyle u_{0}(t)=U_{0}\,\cos \left(\Omega \,t\right),\,}

with
U0 the velocity amplitude of the plate motion (in m/s), and
Ω the angular frequency of the motion (in rad/s).
The plate, located at z = 0, forces the viscous fluid adjacent to have the same velocity u1( z, t ) resulting in the no-slip condition:

{\displaystyle u_{1}(0,t)=u_{0}(t)=U_{0}\,\cos \left(\Omega \,t\right)\quad {\text{ at }}\;z=0.}

Far away from the plate, for z → ∞, the velocity u1 approaches zero. Consequently, the pressure gradient ∂p/∂x is zero at infinity and, since it is only a function of time t and not of z, has to be zero everywhere:

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial u_{1}}{\partial t}}=\nu {\frac {\partial ^{2}u_{1}}{\partial z^{2}}}.}

Such an equation is called a one-dimensional heat equation or diffusion equation.
As a result, the solution for the flow velocity is

{\displaystyle u_{1}(z,t)=U_{0}\,{\text{e}}^{-\kappa \,z}\,\cos \left(\Omega \,t\,-\,\kappa \,z\right)\quad {\text{ with }}\;\kappa \,=\,{\sqrt {\frac {\Omega }{2\nu }}}.}

which is called the Stokes boundary-layer thickness. At a distance δ from the plate, the velocity amplitude has been reduced to e−2π ≈ 0.002 times its value U0 at the plate surface. Further, as can be seen from the phase changes Ω t − κ z in the solution u1, the velocity oscillations propagate as a damped wave away from the wall, with wavelength δ and phase speed Ω / κ.
The vorticity ω1 is equal to

and, as u1, dampens exponentially in amplitude when moving away from the plate surface.
