Microprocessor systems 
 
The  basic  components  of  any  microprocessor 
system (see Fig. 11.1) are: 
 
(a)  a central processing unit (CPU) 
(b)  a  memory,  comprising  both  ‘read/write’  and 
‘read  only’  devices  (commonly  called  RAM 
 
 
and ROM respectively) 
(c)  a  means  of  providing  input  and  output  (I/O). 
For example, a keypad for input and a display 
 
 
for output. 
 
In  a  microprocessor  system  the  functions  of  the 
CPU  are  provided  by  a  single  very  large  scale 
integrated  (VLSI)  microprocessor  chip  (see  Fig. 
11.2). This chip is equivalent to many thousands of
