RECEIVER ROTATION may be in a direction opposite to that desired. When it is necessary to 
reverse receiver rotation, reverse the S1 and S3 connections on either the synchro transmitter or the 
synchro receiver. The causes both synchro rotors to turn through the same angle but in opposite 
directions.
