Computers can be classified in many different ways. They can be classified by the type of 
technology they use (mechanical, electromechanical, or electronic), the purpose for which they were 
designed (general purpose or special purpose), by the type of data they can handle (digital or analog), by 
the amount they cost (from $50 to $10 million and up), and even by their physical size (handheld to room 
size). We will briefly explain mechanical, electromechanical, and electronic computers; special-purpose 
and general-purpose computers; and analog and digital computers.
