The foregoing strategy does not consider area as a factor and thus results in fragmentation of the available
free area; this may make it difﬁcult to place some of the large unplaced cells later. This problem can be overcome,
however, by considering the product of the number of connections and the area of the cell as a criteria for the
selection. Figure 25.17 presents an example of such a strategy. Cell  c3 is selected as the next choice since the
product of its area and its connections to c1 and c2 combine to associate with the maximum value.
Partitioning Method
The  approaches  for  the  partitioning  method  can  be  classiﬁed  as  quadratic  and  sliced  bisection.  In  both
approaches the layout is divided into two subareas, A and B, each having a size within a predeﬁned range. Each
cell is assigned to one of these subareas. This assignment is such that the number of interconnections between
the  two  subareas  is  minimal.  For  example,  Fig. 25.18  presents  successive  steps  for  the  quadratic  and  sliced-
bisection methods. As shown in Fig. 25.18(a), in the ﬁrst step of the quadratic method the layout area is divided
into two almost equal parts; in the second step the layout is further divided into four almost equal parts in the
opposite direction. This process continues until each subarea contains only one cell. Similar to the quadratic
method, the sliced-bisection also divides the layout area into several subareas.
