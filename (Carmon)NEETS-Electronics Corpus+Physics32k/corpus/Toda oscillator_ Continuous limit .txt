The Toda chain equations of motion, in the continuous limit in which the distance between neighbors goes to zero, become the Kortewegâ€“de Vries equation (KdV) equation. Here the index labeling the particle in the chain becomes the new spatial coordinate.
In contrast, the Toda field theory is achieved by introducing a new spatial coordinate which is independent of the chain index label. This is done in a relativistically invariant way, so that time and space are treated on equal grounds. This means that the Toda field theory is not a continuous limit of the Toda chain.
