is 16:9. The system is designed for a bandwidth of 10 MHz per channel. With the 1990 launching of the BS-3
satellite,  two  channels  were  devoted  to  this  form  of  HDTV.  To  Ô¨Åt  the  channel  within  a  10-MHz  bandwidth
(instead of the approximately 50 MHz that would be needed to transmit using traditional techniques), band-
width  compression  was  required.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  Japanese  system  is  primarily  analog  frequency
modulation  (FM)  (the  sound  is  digital).  The  approach  to  decreasing  bandwidth  is  multiple  sub-Nyquist
encoding (MUSE). The sampling below Nyquist lowers the bandwidth requirement, but moving images suffer
from less resolution.
