Generally speaking, conventional dc generators are becoming obsolete and increasingly often are
being replaced by solid-state rectiﬁers in most applications for which an ac supply is available.
The same is not true for dc motors. The torque–speed characteristics of dc motors are what makes
them extremely valuable in many industrial applications. The signiﬁcant features of the dc drives
include adjustable motor speed over wide ranges, constant mechanical power output or torque,
rapid acceleration or deceleration, and responsiveness to feedback signals.
