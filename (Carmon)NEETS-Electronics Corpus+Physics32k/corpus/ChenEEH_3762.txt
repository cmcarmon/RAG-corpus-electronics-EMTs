First, we consider an approach based on the likelihood that
the observations could have been produced using any state
sequence (path) through a given model. The most common
technique applied to this problem is the so-called the forward–
backward (F–B) algorithm, also called Baum-Welch re-
estimation. The full F–B algorithm was developed in the series
of papers by Baum and colleagues (Baum, 1972). The under-
lying principles described in these papers are well beyond the
scope of this treatment. The interested reader is referred, for
example, to Deller et al. (2000) and Rabiner and Juang (1993).
We simply note that the method represents an enormous
savings in computation with respect to the effort required by
exhaustive evaluation of all paths in each model. For S ¼ 5 and
T ¼ 100, for example, the F–B method yields an improvement
of 69 orders of magnitude with respect to the same computa-
tion carried out directly.
The second approach evaluates the likelihood be based on
only the best state sequence through M. A Viterbi search
provides a slightly more cost-efﬁcient alternative to the F–B
method, with typically 10 to 25% fewer computations re-
quired. Recalling that the Viterbi algorithm amounts to a DP
search with stochastic costs, it is not surprising that Viterbi
search returns a total cost based on the single best state path
through the HMM. Formally, given observation string y of
length T and HMM M, the Viterbi search returns the likeli-
hood P(y, IjM), where I¼def
arg maxI2ST P(y, IjM) in
which ST represents the set of legal state sequences (paths)
of duration T.
