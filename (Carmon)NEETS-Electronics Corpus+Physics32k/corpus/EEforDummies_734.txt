You can find a seemingly endless supply of integrated circuits on the market 
today, but two in particular are known far and wide for their outstanding 
versatility and ease of use: the operational amplifier (really a class of ICs) 
and the 555 timer. It pays to get to know these two circuits fairly well if you 
intend to get even remotely serious about developing your electronics habit.
