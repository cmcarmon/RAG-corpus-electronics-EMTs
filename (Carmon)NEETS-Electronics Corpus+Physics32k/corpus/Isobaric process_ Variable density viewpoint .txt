A given quantity (mass m) of gas in a changing volume produces a change in density ρ. In this context the ideal gas law is written




R
(
T

ρ
)
=
M
P


{\displaystyle R(T\,\rho )=MP}

where T is thermodynamic temperature and M is molar mass. When R and M are taken as constant, then pressure P can stay constant as the density-temperature quadrant (ρ,T) undergoes a squeeze mapping.
