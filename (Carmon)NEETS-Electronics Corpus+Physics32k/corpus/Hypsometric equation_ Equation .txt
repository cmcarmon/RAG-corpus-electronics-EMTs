{\displaystyle h=z_{2}-z_{1}={\frac {R\cdot {\bar {T}}}{g}}\cdot \ln \left({\frac {p_{1}}{p_{2}}}\right),}

where:




h


{\displaystyle h}
= thickness of the layer [m],




z


{\displaystyle z}
= geometric height [m],




R


{\displaystyle R}
= specific gas constant for dry air,







T
¯





{\displaystyle {\bar {T}}}
= mean temperature in kelvins [K],




g


{\displaystyle g}
= gravitational acceleration [m/s2],




p


{\displaystyle p}
= pressure [Pa].
In meteorology,




p

1




{\displaystyle p_{1}}
and




p

2




{\displaystyle p_{2}}
are isobaric surfaces. In altimetry with the International Standard Atmosphere the hypsometric equation is used to compute pressure at a given height in isothermal layers in the upper and lower stratosphere.
