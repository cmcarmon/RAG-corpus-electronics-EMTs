Another type of planar tube is shown in figure 2-14. This type of tube, because of its external
appearance, is called an OILCAN TUBE. The major difference between it and the lighthouse tube is the
addition of cooling fins to allow it to handle more power than the lighthouse tube. Because of their planar
construction, both types of tubes are capable of handling large amounts of power at uhf frequencies.
