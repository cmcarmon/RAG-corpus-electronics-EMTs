11.2.10 Consider the magnetic circuit in Figure P11.2.10,
in which all parts have the same cross section.
The coil has 200 turns and carries a current of 5
A. The air gaps are g1 = 0.4 cm and g2 = 0.5
cm. Assuming the core has inﬁnite permeability,
compute the ﬂux density in tesla in (a) gap g1,
(b) gap g2, and (c) the left limb.
