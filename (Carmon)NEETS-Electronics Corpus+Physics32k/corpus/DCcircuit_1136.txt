When connecting and disconnecting charging equipment to a battery, always make the last
connection (or Ô¨Årst disconnection) at a location away from the battery itself (such as at a point
on one of the battery cables, at least a foot away from the battery), so that any resultant spark
has little or no chance of igniting hydrogen gas.
