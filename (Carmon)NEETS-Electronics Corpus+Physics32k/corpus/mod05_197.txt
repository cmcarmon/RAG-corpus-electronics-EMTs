In SERIES MOTORS, the field windings are connected in series with the armature coil. The field 
strength varies with changes in armature current. When its speed is reduced by a load, the series motor 
develops greater torque. Its starting torque is greater than other types of dc motors. Its speed varies widely 
between full-load and no-load. Unloaded operation of large machines is dangerous.
