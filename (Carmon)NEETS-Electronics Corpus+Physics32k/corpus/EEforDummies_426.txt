For values over 1,000 picofarads, your parts supplier will most likely list the 
capacitor in microfarads, even if the markings on it indicate picofarads. To 
convert the picofarad value on the capacitor into microfarads, just move the 
decimal point six places to the left. So a capacitor marked with a 103 (say, the 
example in the preceding paragraph) has a value of 10,000 pF or 0.01 Î¼F.
