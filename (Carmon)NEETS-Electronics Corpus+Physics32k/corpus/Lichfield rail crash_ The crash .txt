The crash occurred at 18:58, and involved the 14:50 fish train from Fleetwood to London Broad Street. This train consisted of seven four-wheel fish vans and a brake van hauled by a Stanier Class 5 4-6-0. It was travelling at around 35 mph when it passed into the station, and was scheduled to run through on the fast up line. However at the north end of the station, it was accidentally diverted by the failed points, onto the station's up passing loop, where it collided with the rear end of a Stafford to Nuneaton local passenger train, which was waiting at the station on the loop. The passenger train consisted of four old wooden-bodied coaches. The force of the impact demolished the rear three coaches, and hurled the engine (a LNWR Prince of Wales Class 4-6-0) forwards 100 yards.
