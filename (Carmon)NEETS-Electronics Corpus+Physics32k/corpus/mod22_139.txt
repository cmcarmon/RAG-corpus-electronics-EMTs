The four major types of instructions are (1) transfer, (2) arithmetic, (3) logic, and (4) control. 
Transfer instructions are those whose basic function is to transfer (move) data from one location to 
another. Arithmetic instructions are those that combine two pieces of data to form a single piece of data 
using one of the arithmetic operations.
