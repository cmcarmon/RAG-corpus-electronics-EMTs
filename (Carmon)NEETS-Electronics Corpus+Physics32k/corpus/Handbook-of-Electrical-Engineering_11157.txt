There  are  many  biomedical  problems  where  it  is
necessary to know the concentration of a particular
substance in a biological sample. Chemical sensors
provide  the  interface  between  an  instrument  and
the  specimen  to  allow  one  to  determine  this  con-
centration. These sensors can be used on a biolog-
ical  specimen  taken  from  the  host  and  tested  in  a
measure-
laboratory, or they can be used for 
ments either as noninvasive or invasive sensors, the
latter being the most frequently used.
