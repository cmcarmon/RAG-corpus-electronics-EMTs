A more recent development in GaAs systems is the heterostructure ﬁeld-effect transistor, or HFET [Pearton
and  Shaw,  1990],  made  up  of  layers  of  varying  compositions  of  Al,  Ga,  and  As  or  In,  Ga,  P,  and  As.  These
devices are made using molecular beam epitaxy or by organometallic vapor phase epitaxy, expensive methods
still  being  reﬁned  for  manufacture.  HFETs  include  a  variety  of  structures,  the  best  known  of  which  is  the
modulation doped FET, or MODFET. HFETs are ﬁeld-effect devices, not MOSFETs, because the gate simply
modulates the carrier density in a preexistent channel between ohmic contacts. The channel is formed spon-
taneously, regardless of the quality of the gate insulator as a condition of equilibrium between the layers, just
as a depletion layer is formed in a pn junction. The resulting channel is created very near to the gate electrode,
resulting in gate control as effective as in a MOSFET.
