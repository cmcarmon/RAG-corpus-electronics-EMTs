As sedimentation field flow fractionation (SFFF) is one of field flow fractionation separation techniques, it is appropriate for fractionation and characterization of particulate materials and soluble samples in the colloid size range. Differences in interaction between a centrifugal force field and particles with different masses or sizes lead to the separation. An exponential distribution of particles of a certain size or weight is results due to the Brownian motion. Some of the assumptions to develop the theoretical equations include that there is no interaction between individual particles and equilibrium can occur anywhere in separation channels.
