In  order  to  illustrate  the  effects  of  various 
transistor  fault  conditions  consider  the  circuit  of  a 
typical  tuned  amplifier  stage  shown  in  Fig.  15.5. 
The 
in  Class  A  with 
conventional base bias potential divider and a tuned 
transformer  collector 
load.  Normal  working 
voltages are shown in the circuit diagram. Note that 
the  junction  potentials  (0.6  V  and  4.7  V  for  the 
base-emitter 
junctions 
respectively)  are  in  agreement  with  the  voltages 
given 
in  Fig.  15.4.  The  circuit  voltages 
corresponding 
transistor  fault 
conditions are shown in Table 15.1. 
  Each fault will now be discussed individually: 
 
Fault 1 
 
The  collector-base  short-circuit  gives  rise 
to 
identical  base  and  collector  voltage.  The  base-
