The spin magnetic moment of a charged, spin-1/2 particle that does not possess any internal structure (a Dirac particle) is given by





μ

=
g


e

2
m




S

,


{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\mu }}=g{e \over 2m}{\boldsymbol {S}},}

where μ is the spin magnetic moment of the particle, g is the g-factor of the particle, e is the elementary charge, m is the mass of the particle, and S is the spin angular momentum of the particle (with magnitude ħ/2 for Dirac particles).
