If the power disconnect switch cannot be located quickly enough, it may be possible to dis-
lodge the victim from the circuit they’re frozen on to by prying them or hitting them away with
a dry wooden board or piece of nonmetallic conduit, common items to be found in industrial
construction scenes. Another item that could be used to safely drag a ”frozen” victim away from
contact with power is an extension cord. By looping a cord around their torso and using it as
a rope to pull them away from the circuit, their grip on the conductor(s) may be broken. Bear
in mind that the victim will be holding on to the conductor with all their strength, so pulling
them away probably won’t be easy!
