In the overlap graph OG (V, E), the set of nodes V ¼ S[
{n1, n2, . . ., nm}, where each ni is a routed net of the circuit
and where S is the set of ‘‘spare’’ track segments as described
above. There exists an edge between ni and nj in the OG if nets
ni and nj share a channel2 in the FPGA. Figure 8.8(B) shows
net n2 and n6 having an edge between them in the OG since
they are routed through a common vertical channel to the
right of cell B3.
