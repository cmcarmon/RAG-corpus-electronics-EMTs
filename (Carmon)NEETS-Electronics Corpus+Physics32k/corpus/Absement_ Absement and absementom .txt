Recent work in mechanics and memristors and memcapacitors further builds on the concept of absement, and assigns it the letter a, and makes extensive use of plots such as the graph of absement as a function of displacement:

... amplitude of the sinusoidal displacement with period T = 2π/ω, and a0 = A/ω is the value about which the analytic absement a(t) oscillates.

(See Table 4, "Analytic Displacement and Absement" versus "Piecewise Continuous Displacement and Absement").
