Figure 34.16 shows that the physical design task generally follows the veriﬁcation task. Having validated the
function and performance of the detailed design during veriﬁcation, physical design realizes the detailed design
by translating logic into actual hardware. Physical design involves placement, routing, artwork generation, rules
checking, and back annotation [Sait and Youseff, 1995].
