Programmable memories operate much like read-only memories with the important attribute that they can
be programmed at least once, and some can be reprogrammed a million times or more. Storage is almost always
by means of a ﬂoating-gate FET. Information in such storage cells is not indeﬁnitely nonvolatile. The discharge
time constant is on the order of ten years. ROMs are generally programmed by a custom information mask
within the fabrication sequence. As the name implies, information thence can only be read. The information
thus stored is truly nonvolatile, even when power is removed. This is the most dense form of semiconductor
storage  (and  the  least  ﬂexible).  Other  forms  of  semiconductor  memories,  such  as  associative  memories  and
charge-coupled devices, are used rarely.
