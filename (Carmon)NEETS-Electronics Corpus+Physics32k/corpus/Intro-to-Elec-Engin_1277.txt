Discrete signals (shown in Figure 6.0.2), on the other hand, exist only at speciﬁc instances
of time, and as such, their functional description is valid only for discrete-time intervals. Dis-
crete signals are invariably a sequence of pulses in which the information is contained in the
pulse characteristics and the relation amidst the pulses in the sequence during a speciﬁed time
interval. Digital computers, pulsed-communication systems (modern telephone and radar), and
microprocessor-based control systems utilize discrete signals. Digital systems process digits, i.e.,
pulse trains, in which the information is carried in the pulse sequence rather than the amplitude–
time characterization of the pulses. Digital systems are often thought of as performing signal
processing in the time domain. Because of the advantages of economy in time, low power
