from the transmitter ﬁlter and additive noise. It is also clear that the signal is both compressed and rotated.
These effects are due to the nonlinear ampliﬁer that was mentioned previously. For this example simulation
the nonlinear ampliﬁer is operating near the saturation point, and the compression of the signal constellation
is due to the AM/AM characteristic of the nonlinearity and the rotation is due to the AM/PM characteristic of
the nonlinearity.
