If the pitcher casts a straight ball, or if the release point shifts, the ball may have a rotation similar to the shoot, which is called shoot rotation or natural shoot. In the case of thinking as a ball, the shoot is an effective ball type, but in this case, it is a mistake of throwing a shot with the intention of throwing a straight ball. Unlike the intended shoot, the release point shifts and the rotation gently become loose, so there is no elongation as a straight ball, the lateral change as a shot is also small, and the control is often not fixed. Especially when a straight ball which is intended to throw aiming at a diagonal ( crossfire ) shoot rotates, it will head towards the center of the strike zone, so it may be easy for the batter to hit. In general, it is recognized that pitchers who do throw these balls are in a bad shape and the method is not stable, but some pitchers use this as a weapon. Teruhiro Kuroki says "put power in the middle finger" against the answer "put power in the index finger" of other pitchers about the point when throwing the slider in " NANDA !? " inactive era I explained the reason, "It will be a shoot to the inner angle when the slider throwing in the outer corner slips out", while explaining the picture. There is no shot on the ball of Kuroki.
