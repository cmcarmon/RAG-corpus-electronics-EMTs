with the signal-present model (73.2) being chosen if the threshold is exceeded, and the signal-absent model
(73.1)  being  chosen  otherwise.  Choice  of  the  decision  threshold  determines  a  trade-off  of  the  two  error
probabilities, and the optimum procedures for the three criteria mentioned above differ only in this choice.
