There  are  several  advantages  to  this  conﬁguration. As  noted
above, the robot is kinematically simple, since motion on each
Cartesian axis corresponds to motion of a single actuator. This
eases the programming of linear motions. In particular, it is easy
to  do  a  straight  vertical  motion,  the  most  common  motion  in
assembly  tasks.  The  Cartesian  geometry  also  yields  a  constant
arm resolution throughout the workspace; i.e., for any conﬁgu-
ration,  the  resolution  for  each  axis  corresponds  directly  to  the
resolution for that joint. The simple geometry of the Cartesian
robot  leads  to  correspondingly  simple  manipulator  dynamics.
The disadvantages of this conﬁguration include inability to reach objects on the ﬂoor or points invisible from
the base of the robot, and slow speed of operation in the horizontal plane compared to robots with a rotary
base. Additionally, the Cartesian conﬁguration requires a large operating volume for a relatively small workspace.
Cartesian robots are used for several applications. As noted above, they are well suited for assembly opera-
tions, as they easily perform vertical straight-line insertions. Because of the ease of straight-line motions, they
are also well suited to machine loading and unloading. They are also used in clean room tasks.
