Various parameters associated with the subprocesses can be visualized from an equivalent circuit. The d-axis
and q-axis (dynamic) equivalent circuits of a synchronous generator consist of resistors, inductors, and voltage
sources.  In  the  subtransient  period,  the  equivalent  of  the  damper  windings  needs  to  be  considered.  In  the
transient period, this equivalent can be ignored. When the new steady state is reached, the current in the rotor
winding becomes a constant (dc); thus, one can further ignore the equivalent inductance of this winding. This
approximate method results in three equivalent circuits, listed in order of complexity: subtransient, transient,
and steady state. For each circuit, one can deﬁne parameters such as (effective) reactance and time constant.
For example, the d-axis circuit for the transient period has an effective reactance  X ¢d and a time constant  T ¢do
(computed  from  the  R-L  circuit)  when  open  circuited.  The  parameters  of  a  synchronous  machine  can  be
computed from experimental data and are used in numerical studies. Typical values for these parameters are
given in Table 66.1.
