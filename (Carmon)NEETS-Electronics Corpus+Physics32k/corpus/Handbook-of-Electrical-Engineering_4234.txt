Table 41.4 provides typical loss and noise temperature budgets for several major radar classes. In general,
loss  increases  with  the  complexity  of  the  radar  hardware  between  the  transmitter/receiver  and  the  antenna
radiator. Reï¬‚ector antennas and active phased arrays impose relatively low loss, while passive array antennas
impose relatively high loss.
