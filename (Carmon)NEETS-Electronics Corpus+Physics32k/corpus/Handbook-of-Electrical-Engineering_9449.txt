It  is  very  important  to  understand  the  difference  between  the  MTTF  and  the  mean  time  between  failure
(MTBF). Unfortunately, these two terms are often used interchangeably. While the numerical difference is small
in many cases, the conceptual difference is very important. The MTTF is the average time until the ﬁrst failure
of a system, while the MTBF is the average time between failures of a system. If we assume that all repairs to
a system make the system perfect once again just as it was when it was new, the relationship between the MTTF
and the MTBF can be determined easily. Once successfully placed into operation, a system will operate, on the
average, a time corresponding to the MTTF before encountering the ﬁrst failure. The system will then require
