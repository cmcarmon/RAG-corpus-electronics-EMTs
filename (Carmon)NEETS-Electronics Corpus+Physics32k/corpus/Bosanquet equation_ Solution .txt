The solution of the Bosanquet equation can be split into two timescales, firstly to account for the initial motion of the fluid by considering a solution in the limit of time approaching 0 giving the form

For the condition of short time this shows a meniscus front position proportional to time rather than the Lucas-Washburn square root of time, and the independence of viscosity demonstrates plug flow.
As time increases after the initial time of acceleration, the equation decays to the familiar Lucas-Washburn form dependent on viscosity and the square root of time.
