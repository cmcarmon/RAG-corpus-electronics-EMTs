which are usually associated with utilization voltages. Residen-
tial and most rural consumers are supplied by 120Y/240-V
single-phase, three-wire systems. Commercial and small indus-
trial consumers are supplied by 208Y/120-V or 480Y/277-V
three-phase, four-wire systems. The secondary voltage also
supplies multiple street lights.
