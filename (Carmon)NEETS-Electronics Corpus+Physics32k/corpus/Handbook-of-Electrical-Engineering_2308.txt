Avalanche and Zener diodes are extensively used as voltage regulators and as overvoltage protection devices.
TC of Zener diodes is negative at VZ £ 3.5 to 4.5 V and is equal to zero at about VZ » 5 V. TC of a Zener diode
operating above 5 V is in general positive. Above 10 V the pn-diodes operate as avalanche diodes with a strong
positive temperature coefﬁcient. The TC of a Zener diode is more predictable than that of the avalanche diode.
Temperature-compensated  Zener  diodes  utilize  the  positive TC  of  a  7-V  Zener  diode,  which  is  compensated
with a series-connected forward-biased diode with a negative TC. The disadvantage of Zener diodes is a relatively
large electronic noise.
