Using a consolidation curve:(Casagrande 1936)
Choose by eye the point of maximum curvature on the consolidation curve.
Draw a horizontal line from this point.
Draw a line tangent to the curve at the point found in part 1.
Bisect the angle made from the horizontal line in part 2 and the tangent line in part 3.
Extend the "straight portion" of the virgin compression curve (high effective stress, low void ratio: almost vertical on the right of the graph) up to the bisector line in part 4.
The point where the lines in part 4 and part 5 intersect is the preconsolidation pressure.
Gregory et al.  proposed an analytical method to calculate preconsolidation stress that avoids subjective interpretations of the location of the maximum curvature point (i.e. Minimum radius of curvature). Tom√°s et al. used this method to calculate the preconsolidation pressure of 139 undisturbed soil samples to generate preconsolidation pressure maps of the Vega Baja of the Segura (Spain).
