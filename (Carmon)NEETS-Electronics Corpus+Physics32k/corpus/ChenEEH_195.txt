In ﬁlter design, we place the transfer zeros almost always on
the imaginary axis because this secures largest suppression
in the stopband. In most cases, a low-pass
of the signal
ﬁlter should have approximately constant transfer of
low
frequencies and rapid suppression of
frequencies beyond
the speciﬁed passband. This may result in almost constant
transfer of the desired frequencies, but the group delay re-
sponse is then far from ideal. We have analyzed one such
ﬁlter, Figure 4.12, with its amplitude responses in Figure
4.13(A) through Figure 4.13D and with the group delay in
Figure 4.14.
