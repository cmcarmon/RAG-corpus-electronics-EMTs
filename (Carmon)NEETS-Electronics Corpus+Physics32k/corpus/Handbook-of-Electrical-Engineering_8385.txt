Software engineering as discussed in Chapter 90 refers to the serious problem of managing the complexity
of the layers of software. This problem has few parallels in other walks of life and is exacerbated by the rate of
change in computing. It is dominated by the overall question “Is this computer system reliable?” which will be
referred to in Chapter 98. Some parallels can be drawn with other complex human organizations, and, fortu-
nately, the computer itself can be applied to the task.
