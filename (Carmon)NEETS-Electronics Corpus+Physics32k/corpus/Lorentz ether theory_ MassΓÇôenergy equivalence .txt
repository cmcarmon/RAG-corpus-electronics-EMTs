It was derived by Einstein (1905) as a consequence of the relativity principle, that inertia of energy is actually represented by



E

/


c

2




{\displaystyle E/c^{2}}
, but in contrast to Poincaré's 1900-paper, Einstein recognized that matter itself loses or gains mass during the emission or absorption. So the mass of any form of matter is equal to a certain amount of energy, which can be converted into and re-converted from other forms of energy. This is the mass–energy equivalence, represented by



E
=
m

c

2




{\displaystyle E=mc^{2}}
. So Einstein didn't have to introduce "fictitious" masses and also avoided the perpetual motion problem, because according to Darrigol , Poincaré's radiation paradox can simply be solved by applying Einstein's equivalence. If the light source loses mass during the emission by



E

/


c

2




{\displaystyle E/c^{2}}
, the contradiction in the momentum law vanishes without the need of any compensating effect in the ether.
Similar to Poincaré, Einstein concluded in 1906 that the inertia of (electromagnetic) energy is a necessary condition for the center of mass theorem to hold in systems, in which electromagnetic fields and matter are acting on each other. Based on the mass–energy equivalence he showed that emission and absorption of em-radiation and therefore the transport of inertia solves all problems. On that occasion, Einstein referred to Poincaré's 1900-paper and wrote:
Also Poincaré's rejection of the reaction principle due to the violation of the mass conservation law can be avoided through Einstein's



E
=
m

{\displaystyle E=mc^{2}}
, because mass conservation appears as a special case of the energy conservation law.
