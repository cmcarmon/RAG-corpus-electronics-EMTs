Figure 10-6 shows a simple model of an NPN transistor on the left, and the 
circuit symbol for an NPN transistor on the right. The model includes a 
diode representing the base‚Äêemitter junction, and a variable resistance, RCE, 
between the collector and the emitter. The value of the variable resistance is 
controlled by the diode in this model. Voltages, currents, and transistor   
terminals are labeled so you can see how the model corresponds to the 
actual device.
