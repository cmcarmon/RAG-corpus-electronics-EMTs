You might hear that a vacuum tube is a voltage-operated device (since the grid does not need to draw 
current) while the transistor is a current-operated device. You might agree with this statement, but both 
the vacuum tube and the transistor are still current-control devices. The whole secret to understanding 
amplifiers is to remember that fact. Current control is the name of the game. Once current is controlled 
you can use it to give you a voltage gain or a power gain.
