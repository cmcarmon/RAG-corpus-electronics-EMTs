The time-varying impulse response h(t2,t1) of a linear system is defined as the response of the system at time t = t2 to a single impulse applied at time t = t1. In other words, if the input x(t) to a linear system is




x
(
t
)
=
δ
(
t
−

t

1


)



{\displaystyle x(t)=\delta (t-t_{1})\,}

where δ(t) represents the Dirac delta function, and the corresponding response y(t) of the system is




y
(
t
)

t
=

t

=
h
(

t

2


,

t

1


)



{\displaystyle y(t)|_{t=t_{2}}=h(t_{2},t_{1})\,}

then the function h(t2,t1) is the time-varying impulse response of the system. Since the system cannot respond before the input is applied the following causality condition must be satisfied:




h
(

t

)

{\displaystyle h(t_{2},t_{1})=0,t_{2}<t_{1}}
