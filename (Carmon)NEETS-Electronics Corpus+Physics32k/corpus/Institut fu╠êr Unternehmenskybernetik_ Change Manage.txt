As stipulated previously, the IfU carried out several projects in the field of change management to help organisations adapt to the fluctuating market conditions. CuBa Change is one of the newer developments. The projectâ€™s objective is to develop a practical and easy process of quality-orientated safeguard and adoption of Changes Processes for SMEs, whilst abiding by the more fundamental features of corporate culture. In this way a management-specific situational analysis of Change-Proposals will be enabled, increasing the likelihood of success and the ability to cope with the constant need to adapt to change.
