Programs are networks of objects that send messages to one 
another without concern for tree structure.
Program components have abstractions of corres-pondence 
with the real world, thus making programming more of a 
discipline.
New programs are mostly specializations of earlier programs 
through reuse of their components. This leads to low 
construction costs and higher quality.
