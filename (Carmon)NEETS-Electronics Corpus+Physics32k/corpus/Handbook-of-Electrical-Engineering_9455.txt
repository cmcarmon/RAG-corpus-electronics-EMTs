An interesting relationship exists in a series system if each individual component satisﬁes the exponential
failure  law.  Suppose  that  we  have  a  series  system  made  up  of N  components,  and  each  component,  i,  has  a
constant failure rate of li. Also assume that each component satisﬁes the exponential failure law. The reliability
of the series system is given by
