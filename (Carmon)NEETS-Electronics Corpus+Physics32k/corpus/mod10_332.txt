SEASONAL.â€”Seasonal variations are the result of the Earth revolving around the sun; the relative 
position of the sun moves from one hemisphere to the other with changes in seasons.  Seasonal variations 
of the D, E, and F1 layers correspond to the highest angle of the sun; thus the ionization density of these 
layers is greatest during the summer. The F2 layer, however, does not follow this pattern; its ionization is 
greatest in winter and least in summer, the reverse of what might be expected. As a result, operating 
frequencies for F2 layer propagation are higher in the winter than in the summer.
