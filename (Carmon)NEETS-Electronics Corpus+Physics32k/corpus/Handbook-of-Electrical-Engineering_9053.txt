Resistive Ribbon Printing.  This technology grew from the need to provide quality thermal printing at higher
speeds  and  on  a  wide  range  of  papers,  including  standard  ofﬁce  bonds.  With  this  technology,  the  heating
function is repositioned from within the printhead into the ribbon itself. The ribbon (see Fig. 89.32) includes
an additional aluminum conductive and heating thin-ﬁlm layer, sandwiched between the “standard” thermo-
plastic ink layer and the ribbon substrate. The substrate is made conductive (350–900 V/M) by the incorpo-
ration  of  sufﬁcient  (20–30%)  carbon  black  in  the  polycarbonate  ﬁlm.  Joule  heating  occurs  as  current  ﬂows
from the addressable head pixel-size electrodes through the aluminum layer to the large single-ground return
electrode. Current density is maximum directly beneath the addressable electrodes so that temperatures there
(but not elsewhere) are sufﬁcient to cause ink layer melt and transfer. In addition, a thin release layer can be
added between the ink layer and the aluminum heating layer to provide enhanced and smooth-edged pixels;
this provides sharp character edges and allows more detail in images.
