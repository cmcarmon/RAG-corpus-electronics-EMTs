The calculation of vector ﬁelds from arbitrary charge distribu-
tions using equation 2.10 is made straightforward by modern
computational machines and vector ﬁeld visualization software.
When simple expressions, however, are desired to aid intuition,
or when memory storage is at a premium during numerical
computations, a scalar ﬁeld is much more convenient.
