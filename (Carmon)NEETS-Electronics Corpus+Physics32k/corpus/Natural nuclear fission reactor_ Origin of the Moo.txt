Published in 2010, a controversial hypothesis about the origin of the Moon proposes that the Moon may have been formed from the explosion of a georeactor located along the core-mantle boundary at the equatorial plane of the then-rapidly rotating Earth, 4.5 billion years ago.
While this hypothesis would explain in part the compositional similarities between the Moon and the Earth, the giant impact hypothesis remains more commonly accepted, as it may arguably explain both the similarities and certain differences in the composition of the Moon.
