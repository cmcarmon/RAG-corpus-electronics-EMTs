Mobile Data Systems
The design aspect of developing a mobile data system is different from that of developing a cellular voice system,
although the mobile radio environment is the same. The quality of a voice channel has to be determined based
on a subjective test. The quality of a data transmission is based on an objective test. In a data transmission, the
bit error rate and the word error rate are the parameters to be used to measure the performance at any given
carrier-to-interference ratio (C/I). The burst errors caused by the multipath fading and the intersymbol inter-
ference caused by the time delay spread are the major concerns in receiving the mobile data. The burst errors
can be reduced by interleaving and coding. The intersymbol interference can be reduced by using equalizers
or lowering the symbol rate or applying diversity.
