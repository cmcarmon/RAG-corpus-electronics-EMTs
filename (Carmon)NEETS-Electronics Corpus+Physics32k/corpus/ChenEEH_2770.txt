In Section 9.4, we saw that the choice of D and Dt can affect
the propagation characteristics of numerical waves in the
FDTD space lattice and, therefore, the numerical error. In
this section, we show that, in addition, Dt must be bounded
to ensure numerical stability. Our approach to determine the
upper bound on Dt is based on the complex-frequency analy-
sis reported by Taï¬‚ove and Hagness (2000). This technique
allows straightforward estimates of the exponential growth rate
of unstable numerical solutions.
