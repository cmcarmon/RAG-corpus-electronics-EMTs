The pattern radiated by the collinear array is similar to that produced by a single dipole. The addition 
of the second radiator, however, tends to intensify the pattern. Compare the radiation pattern of the dipole 
(view A of figure 4-25) and the two-element antenna in view B. You will see that each pattern consists of 
two major lobes in opposite directions along the same axis, QQ1. There is little or no radiation along the
