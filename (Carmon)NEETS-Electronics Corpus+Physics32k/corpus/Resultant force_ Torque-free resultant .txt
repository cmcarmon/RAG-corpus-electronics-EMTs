It is useful to consider whether there is a point of application R such that the associated torque is zero. This point is defined by the property

R

F

,


{\displaystyle \mathbf {R} \times \mathbf {F} =\sum _{i=1}^{n}\mathbf {R} _{i}\times \mathbf {F} _{i},}

where F is resultant force and Fi form the system of forces.
Notice that this equation for R has a solution only if the sum of the individual torques on the right side yield a vector that is perpendicular to F. Thus, the condition that a system of forces has a torque-free resultant can be written as





F

)
=
0.


{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} \cdot (\sum _{i=1}^{n}\mathbf {R} _{i}\times \mathbf {F} _{i})=0.}

If this condition is satisfied then there is a point of application for the resultant which results in a pure force. If this condition is not satisfied, then the system of forces includes a pure torque for every point of application.
