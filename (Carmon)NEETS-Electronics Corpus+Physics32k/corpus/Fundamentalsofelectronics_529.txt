• A simple computer operates fundamentally in discrete time. Computers are clocked devices,
in which computational steps occur periodically according to ticks of a clock. This description belies
clock speed: When you say “I have a 1 GHz computer,” you mean that your computer takes 1 nanosec-
ond to perform each step. That is incredibly fast! A “step” does not, unfortunately, necessarily mean
a computation like an addition; computers break such computations down into several stages, which
means that the clock speed need not express the computational speed. Computational speed is ex-
pressed in units of millions of instructions/second (Mips). Your 1 GHz computer (clock speed) may
have a computational speed of 200 Mips.
• Computers perform integer (discrete-valued) computations. Computer calculations can be
numeric (obeying the laws of arithmetic), logical (obeying the laws of an algebra), or symbolic (obeying
any law you like).4 Each computer instruction that performs an elementary numeric calculation —
an addition, a multiplication, or a division — does so only for integers. The sum or product of two
integers is also an integer, but the quotient of two integers is likely to not be an integer. How does
a computer deal with numbers that have digits to the right of the decimal point? This problem is
addressed by using the so-called ﬂoating-point representation of real numbers. At its heart, however,
this representation relies on integer-valued computations.
