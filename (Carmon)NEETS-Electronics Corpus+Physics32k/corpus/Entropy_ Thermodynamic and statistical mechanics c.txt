Entropy unit – a non-S.I. unit of thermodynamic entropy, usually denoted "e.u." and equal to one calorie per Kelvin per mole, or 4.184 Joules per Kelvin per mole.
Gibbs entropy – the usual statistical mechanical entropy of a thermodynamic system.
Boltzmann entropy – a type of Gibbs entropy, which neglects internal statistical correlations in the overall particle distribution.
Tsallis entropy – a generalization of the standard Boltzmann–Gibbs entropy.
Standard molar entropy – is the entropy content of one mole of substance, under conditions of standard temperature and pressure.
Residual entropy – the entropy present after a substance is cooled arbitrarily close to absolute zero.
Entropy of mixing – the change in the entropy when two different chemical substances or components are mixed.
Loop entropy – is the entropy lost upon bringing together two residues of a polymer within a prescribed distance.
Conformational entropy – is the entropy associated with the physical arrangement of a polymer chain that assumes a compact or globular state in solution.
Entropic force – a microscopic force or reaction tendency related to system organization changes, molecular frictional considerations, and statistical variations.
Free entropy – an entropic thermodynamic potential analogous to the free energy.
Entropic explosion – an explosion in which the reactants undergo a large change in volume without releasing a large amount of heat.
Entropy change – a change in entropy dS between two equilibrium states is given by the heat transferred dQrev divided by the absolute temperature T of the system in this interval.
Sackur–Tetrode entropy – the entropy of a monatomic classical ideal gas determined via quantum considerations.
