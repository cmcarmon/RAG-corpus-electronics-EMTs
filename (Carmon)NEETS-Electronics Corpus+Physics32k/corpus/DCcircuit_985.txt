In Octave, an open source Matlab R(cid:13) clone, enter the coefﬁcients into the A matrix between
square brackets with column elements comma separated, and rows semicolon separated.[4]
Enter the voltages into the column vector: b. The unknown currents: I1, I2, and I3 are calcu-
lated by the command: x=A\b. These are contained within the x column vector.
