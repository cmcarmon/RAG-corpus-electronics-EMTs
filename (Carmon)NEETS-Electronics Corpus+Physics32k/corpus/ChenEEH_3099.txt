All of the devices considered here are magnetic (i.e., they use
the energy in a magnetic Ô¨Åeld to produce force or torque). It is
possible to construct electrostatic motors and actuators, but in
standard sizes, the energy density is too low to make them
competitive. Consider a simple linear system consisting of a
resistance and a position-dependent inductance connected to
an electrical supply. The circuit equation is as follows:
