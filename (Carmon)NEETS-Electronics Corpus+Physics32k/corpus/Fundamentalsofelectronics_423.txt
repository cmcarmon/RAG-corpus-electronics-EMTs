The only diﬃculty in calculating the Fourier transform of any signal occurs when we have periodic signals
(in either domain). Realizing that the Fourier series is a special case of the Fourier transform, we simply
calculate the Fourier series coeﬃcients instead, and plot them along with the spectra of non-periodic signals
on the same frequency axis.
