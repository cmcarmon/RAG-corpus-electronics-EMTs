The question of stability can also be answered with Nyquist diagrams. They are related to Bode diagrams,
but they give more information. A simple way to construct a Nyquist diagram is to make a polar plot on the
complex  frequency  plane  of  the  Bode  diagram.  Simply  stated,  if  this  contour  encircles  the  â€“1  point  in  the
complex frequency plane, then the system is unstable. The two advantages of the Nyquist technique are (1) in
