The resultant vector in view (B) is obtained by adding vector U to vector L. Since each sideband has 
one-half the amplitude of the carrier, and the two sidebands differ in phase by 90 degrees, the amplitude 
of the resultant vector can be computed. This computation (not shown) would show the resultant vector to 
have an amplitude that is approximately 70 percent that of the carrier. Thus, at T2 the amplitude of the 
modulation envelope is about 1.7 times the amplitude of the carrier. This condition is shown in figure 
1-43, view (F).
