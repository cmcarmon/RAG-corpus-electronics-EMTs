In a manufacturing process or assembly operation, the actions required of a gripper will vary with the task.
Much work has been done in developing multiﬁgured hands such as the Utah-MIT hand, the Salisbury hand,
and others with an increasing interest of adding tactile sensory input for dexterous manipulation [Allen et al.,
1989]. As noted by Allen and his colleagues, robotic systems need to process multiple source data and be easily
programmable  for  grasping  and  manipulation  tasks.  One  study  focused  on  capturing  a  machinist’s  skill  in
working with parts and tools and codifying this knowledge in a grip taxonomy has been done by Cutkosky and
Wright [1986]. Their study suggests some general principles for the design, construction, and control of hands
in a manufacturing (particularly machining) environment. The reader is also referred to the work of Feddema
and Ahmad [1986] for the development of an algorithm for a static robot grasp for automated assembly and
the work of Cutkosky [1991] on robotic grasping and manipulation. This latter work considers dynamic contact
and  the  application  of  dynamic  tactile  sensors  in  manipulation  tasks.  An  application  to  identify  and  locate
circuit board ﬁxtures within a robotic workcell that integrates a vision system with a tactile probe is given by
DeMeter and Deisenroth [1987].
