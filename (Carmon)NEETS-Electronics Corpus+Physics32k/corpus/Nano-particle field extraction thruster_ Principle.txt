The nanoFET's adjustable force and specific impulse make it extremely versatile. It can produce more thrust while using less power and fuel than any other electronic thrust system. In addition, no charge is built up within the system as a whole; any negative charge built up on one charging pad is canceled by the positive charge built up on another. The high level of integration with its fuel containers makes it extremely compact and easy to place in a space ship. Unfortunately, like all other electronic thrusters, it produces nowhere near the amount of thrust that current chemical rockets produce (a few hundred Newtons compared to ~15 million Newtons). Although the fact that it doesn't need a few million pounds of fuel does significantly offset this power difference, in their current form, nanoFETs are not suitable for earth based launches.
A nanoFET works in a fairly straightforward manner. It consists of three main parts: a particle storage area, a charging pad, and an acceleration grid. To start, it transports cylindrical particles to the charging pad which then imposes a charge on the particles. As the particle gains charge, the pulling force from the acceleration grid increases. Eventually, this pulling force overpowers the electro-magnetic and surface adhesion forces between the particles and charging pad. Now the particle begins accelerating towards the acceleration grid until it is shot out of the nanoFET, consequently pushing the nanoFET in the opposite direction.
There are two types of nanoFET, a dry-nanoFET and the "normal" wet-nanoFET. The prefix refers to their method of particle transportation, a wet-nanoFET uses liquid whereas a dry does not.
