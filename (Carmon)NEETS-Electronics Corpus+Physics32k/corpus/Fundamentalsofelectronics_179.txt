The input-output relation for circuits involving energy storage elements takes the form of an ordinary diï¬€er-
ential equation, which we must solve to determine what the output voltage is for a given input. In contrast
to resistive circuits, where we obtain an explicit input-output relation, we now have an implicit relation
that requires more work to obtain answers.
