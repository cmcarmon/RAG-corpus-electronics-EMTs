All objects absorb some of the light that falls on them. An object appears to be a certain color
because it absorbs all of the light waves except those whose frequency corresponds to that particular
color. Those waves are reflected from the surface, strike your eye, and cause you to see the particular
color. The color of an object therefore depends on the frequency of the electromagnetic wave reflected.
