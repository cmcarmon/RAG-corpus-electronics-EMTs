monics must be either ‘‘tuned’’ or ﬁltered at the output. In the
case of harmonic tuning, a resonant circuit at harmonic fre-
quencies is formed at the output from either transmission line
stubs or chip capacitors, where the capacitors possess a self-
resonance near the harmonic frequencies. The power in the
harmonics is then reﬂected back to the device with an appro-
priate phase to add to the fundamental power, therefore in-
creasing efﬁciency. In practice, it is difﬁcult to tune more than
the ﬁrst two or three harmonics. Additional ﬁltering will often
be required at the output.
