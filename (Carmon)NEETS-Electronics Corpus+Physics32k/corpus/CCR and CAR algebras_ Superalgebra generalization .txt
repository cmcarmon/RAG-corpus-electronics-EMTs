is the obvious superalgebra generalization which unifies CCRs with CARs: if all pure elements are even, one obtains a CCR, while if all pure elements are odd, one obtains a CAR.
In mathematics, the abstract structure of the CCR and CAR algebras, over any field, not just the complex numbers, is studied by the name of Weyl and Clifford algebras, where many significant results have accrued. One of these is that the graded generalizations of Weyl and Clifford algebras allow the basis-free formulation of the canonical commutation and anticommutation relations in terms of a symplectic and a symmetric non-degenerate bilinear form. In addition the binary elements in this graded Weyl algebra give a basis-free version of the commutation relations of the symplectic and indefinite orthogonal Lie algebras.
