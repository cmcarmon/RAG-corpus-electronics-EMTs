Exergy uses system boundaries in a way that is unfamiliar to many. We imagine the presence of a Carnot engine between the system and its reference environment even though this engine does not exist in the real world. Its only purpose is to measure the results of a "what-if" scenario to represent the most efficient work interaction possible between the system and its surroundings.
If a real-world reference environment is chosen that behaves like an unlimited reservoir that remains unaltered by the system, then Carnot's speculation about the consequences of a system heading towards equilibrium with time is addressed by two equivalent mathematical statements. Let B, the exergy or available work, decrease with time, and Stotal, the entropy of the system and its reference environment enclosed together in a larger isolated system, increase with time:

(1)




{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} B}{\mathrm {d} t}}\leq 0{\mbox{ is equivalent to }}{\frac {\mathrm {d} S_{total}}{\mathrm {d} t}}\geq 0\qquad {\mbox{(1)}}}

For macroscopic systems (above the thermodynamic limit), these statements are both expressions of the second law of thermodynamics if the following expression is used for exergy:

(2)




{\displaystyle B=U+P_{R}V-T_{R}S-\sum _{i}\mu _{i,R}N_{i}\qquad {\mbox{(2)}}}

where the extensive quantities for the system are: U = Internal energy, V = Volume, and Ni = Moles of component i
The intensive quantities for the surroundings are: PR = Pressure, TR = temperature, μi, R = Chemical potential of component i
Individual terms also often have names attached to them:




P

R


V


{\displaystyle P_{R}V}
is called "available PV work",




T

R


S


{\displaystyle T_{R}S}
is called "entropic loss" or "heat loss" and the final term is called "available chemical energy."
Other thermodynamic potentials may be used to replace internal energy so long as proper care is taken in recognizing which natural variables correspond to which potential. For the recommended nomenclature of these potentials, see (Alberty, 2001)[2]. Equation (2) is useful for processes where system volume, entropy, and number of moles of various components change because internal energy is also a function of these variables and no others.
An alternative definition of internal energy does not separate available chemical potential from U. This expression is useful (when substituted into equation (1)) for processes where system volume and entropy change, but no chemical reaction occurs:

{\displaystyle B=U[\mu _{1},\mu _{2},...\mu _{n}]+P_{R}V-T_{R}S=U[{\boldsymbol {\mu }}]+P_{R}V-T_{R}S\qquad {\mbox{(3)}}}

In this case a given set of chemicals at a given entropy and volume will have a single numerical value for this thermodynamic potential. A multi-state system may complicate or simplify the problem because the Gibbs phase rule predicts that intensive quantities will no longer be completely independent from each other.
