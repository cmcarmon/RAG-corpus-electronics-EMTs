You already know it takes a program to make the computer function. You load an operating system 
into the computer to manage the computer's resources and operations. You give job information to the 
operating system to tell it what you want the computer to do. You may tell it to assemble or compile a 
COBOL program. You may tell it to run the payroll or print inventory reports. You may tell it to copy a 
tape using a utility program. You may tell it to print the data from a disk file, also using a utility program. 
You may tell it to test a program. This job information may be entered through the console or read into 
the computer from tape or disk. It also may be entered by the programmer or user from a remote computer 
terminal. The operating system receives and processes the job information and executes the programs 
according to that job information.
