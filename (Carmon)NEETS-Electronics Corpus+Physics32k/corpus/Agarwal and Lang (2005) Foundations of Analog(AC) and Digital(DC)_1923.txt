Let us now examine the frequency response of circuits with a single storage
element and a single resistor, an important class of first-order circuits, and
see how their responses can be sketched by inspection. Such circuits result in
transfer functions of the form 1/(s + a), (s + a), s/(s + a), (s + a)/s, where a is
some constant. We will illustrate the approach using as an example the series
RL circuit from Figure 13.11 in Section 13.3.1.
