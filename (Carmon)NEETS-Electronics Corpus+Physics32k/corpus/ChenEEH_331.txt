channel doping densities yield wider depletion region widths
and hence smaller values for C0
dep. Another critical parameter is
the gate oxide thickness, which determines C0
ox. To minimize S,
the thinnest possible oxide must be used. The most widely
used unit for S is mV/decade. Typical values range from 60 to
100 mV/decade.
