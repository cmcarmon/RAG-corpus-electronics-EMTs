Tidal Energy
The origin of 
is the upward-acting gravitational force of the moon, which results in a cyclic variation
in the potential energy of water at a point on the earth’s surface. These variations are ampliﬁed by topographical
features such as the shape and size of estuaries. The ratio between maximum spring tide and minimum at neap
can be as much as 3 to 1. In estuaries, the tidal range can be as large as 10 to 15 m.
