A number of fatal industrial accidents produced by combustion and detonation of leaked silane in air have been reported.
If a leaking stream of silane is obstructed or confined, energy release due to combustion is more concentrated leading to increasing reaction speed and burning velocity – up to gas phase detonation and potentially severe damages. Silane may autoignite at under 54 °C (130 °F).
SiH4(g) + 2O2(g) → SiO2(s) + 2H2O(g) with ΔH = –1517 kJ/mol
Hazardous byproducts of combustion
SiH4(g) + O2(g) → SiO2(s) + 2H2(g)
SiH4(g) + O2(g) → SiH2O(s) + H2O(g)
2SiH4(g) + O2(g) → 2SiH2O(s) + 2H2(g)
SiH2O(s) + O2(g) → SiO2(s) + H2O(g)
For lean mixtures a two-stage reaction process has been proposed, which consists of a silane consumption process and a hydrogen oxidation process. The heat of SiO2 (s) condensation increases the burning velocity due to thermal feedback.
Diluted silane mixtures with inert gases such as nitrogen or argon are even more likely to ignite when leaked into open air, compared to pure silane: even a 1% mixture of silane in pure nitrogen easily ignites when exposed to air.
In Japan, in order to reduce the danger of silane for amorphous silicon solar cell manufacturing, several companies began to dilute silane with hydrogen gas. This resulted in a symbiotic benefit of making more stable solar photovoltaic cells as it reduced the Staebler-Wronski Effect.
Unlike methane, silane is fairly toxic: the lethal concentration in air for rats (LC50) is 0.96% (9,600 ppm) over a 4-hour exposure. In addition, contact with eyes may form silicic acid with resultant irritation.
In regards to occupational exposure of silane to workers, the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has set a recommended exposure limit of 5 ppm (7 mg/m3) over an eight-hour time-weighted average.
