Belief theory is yet another alternative approach. Dempster-
Shafer theory of evidence performs reasoning under uncer-
tainty in a structured space of hypotheses. It provides a means
for computing a belief function over the hypothesis space and a
way for combining belief function derived from different pieces
of evidence. This approach is based on better mathematical
foundations than the CF approach and is more general than
the Bayesian and CF approaches (Durkin, 1993).
