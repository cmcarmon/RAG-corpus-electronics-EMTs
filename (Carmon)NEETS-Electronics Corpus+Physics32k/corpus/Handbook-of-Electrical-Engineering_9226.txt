The  defect  potential  of  software  tends  to  be  alarmingly  high. When  expressed  with  the  traditional  metric
“KLOC” (where K stands for 1000 and LOC stands for lines of code) the observed defect potentials have ranged
from about 10 bugs per KLOC to more than 100 bugs per KLOC, assuming procedural languages such as C,
