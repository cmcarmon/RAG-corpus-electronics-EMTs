There are two further categories of ‘‘vowel-like’’ phonemes.
A diphthong involves an intentional movement from one
vowel toward another vowel. The three diphthongs that are
universally accepted are =Y =, =W =, and =O= (corresponding
examples occur in pie, out, and toy). The other group of
vowel-like phonemes consists of =w=, =l=, =r=, and =y=,
which are called semivowels. Semivowels are classiﬁed as
either liquids (=w= in wet and =l= in lawn) or glides (=r= in
ran and =y= in yam).
