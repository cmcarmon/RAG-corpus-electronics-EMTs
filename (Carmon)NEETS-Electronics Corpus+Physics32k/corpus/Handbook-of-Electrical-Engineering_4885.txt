approximation are recovered by allowing the masses to vary. The relaxation times, ti, will also be taken to be
isotropic (not k dependent) within each band but can be different from band to band. Although extreme, these
approximations are often qualitatively correct, particularly in polycrystalline materials, which are macroscop-
ically isotropic. Further, in semiconductors these results will be strictly applicable only if ti is energy independent
as well as isotropic.
