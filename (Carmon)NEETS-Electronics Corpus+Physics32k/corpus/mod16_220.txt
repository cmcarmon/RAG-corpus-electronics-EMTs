(usually tungsten) is extremely small in diameter. This thin diameter allows the rf current to penetrate to
the center of the wire. The wire is supported in an insulating capsule between two metallic ends, which
act as connectors. Because of these physical characteristics, the barretter resembles a cartridge-type fuse.
The enclosure is a quartz capsule made in two parts. One part is an insert cemented in place after the
tungsten wire has been mounted. In operation, the barretter is matched to the rf line after power is applied.
