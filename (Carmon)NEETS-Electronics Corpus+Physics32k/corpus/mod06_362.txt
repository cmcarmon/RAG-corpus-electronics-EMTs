The proper name, BRIGHTNESS CONTROL, is given to the potentiometer used to vary the
potential applied to the control grid. The control grid actually serves as an electron lens. It is this
electronic lens that you adjust when you turn up the brightness control on your TV set. Notice that the
effect of the grid is to focus the electron beam at point P in figure 2-19.
