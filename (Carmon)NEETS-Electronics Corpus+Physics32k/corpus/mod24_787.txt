Most of the discussion on fiber optic data links provided earlier in this training manual refers to
simple point-to-point links. A point-to-point fiber optic data link consists of an optical transmitter,
optical fiber, and an optical receiver. In addition, any splices or connectors used to join individual optical
fiber sections to each other and to the transmitter and the receiver are included. Figure 8-1 provides a
schematic diagram of a point-to-point fiber optic data link.
