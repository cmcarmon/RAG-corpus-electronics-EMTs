.


{\displaystyle E=c\cdot {\sqrt {\frac {m_{e}\cdot n_{e}}{\varepsilon _{0}}}}.}

In this equation,



E


{\displaystyle E}
is the electric field,



c


{\displaystyle c}
is the speed of light in vacuum,




m

e




{\displaystyle m_{e}}
is the mass of the electron,




n

e




{\displaystyle n_{e}}
is the plasma electron density (in particles per metre cubed), and




ε

0




{\displaystyle \varepsilon _{0}}
is the permittivity of free space.
