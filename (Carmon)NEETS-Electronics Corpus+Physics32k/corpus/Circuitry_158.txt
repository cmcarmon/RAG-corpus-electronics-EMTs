Example 3.10 
 
A 100  ÂµF  capacitor  is  charged  from  a  350  V  d.c. 
supply  through  a  series  resistance  of  1  kF.
Determine  the  initial  charging  current  and  the 
current  that  will  flow  50  ms  and  100  ms  after 
connecting  the  supply.  After  what  time  is  the 
capacitor considered to be fully charged?
