There can be two types of singularities of the n-body problem:
collisions of two or more bodies, but for which q(t) (the bodies' positions) remains finite. (In this mathematical sense, a "collision" means that two pointlike bodies have identical positions in space.)
singularities in which a collision does not occur, but q(t) does not remain finite. In this scenario, bodies diverge to infinity in a finite time, while at the same time tending towards zero separation (an imaginary collision occurs "at infinity").
The latter ones are called Painlevé's conjecture (no-collisions singularities). Their existence has been conjectured for n > 3 by Painlevé (see Painlevé conjecture). Examples of this behavior for n = 5 have been constructed by Xia and a heuristic model for n = 4 by Gerver. Donald G. Saari has shown that for 4 or fewer bodies, the set of initial data giving rise to singularities has measure zero.
