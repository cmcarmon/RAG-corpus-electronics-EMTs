This example illustrates a fundamental design principle of op amp circuits: If A is 
very large, then the closed-loop gain is dependent only on the feedback resistors R1 and 
R2.  Therefore,  the  closed-loop  gain  can  be  made  very  accurate  and  stable  since  very 
accurate  and  stable  resistors  can  be  purchased. Effectively,  op  amps  use  feedback  to 
exchange  high  open-loop  gain  for  stable  closed-loop  gain.  Additionally,  the  only 
requirement in making this amplifier work as an ideal amplifier is that A must be large. A 
does not need to a particular value, nor does it need to be linear with input (although, A 
should maintain the same sign for all possible inputs). 
 
10.4 Inverting Amplifier 
 
The block diagram representation of an inverting amplifier is shown in Figure 10.3. Both 
the  input  and  output  can  be  modeled  as  independent  sources  and  superposition  can  be 
applied  to  determine  the  signal  applied  to  the  minus  terminal  of  the  op  amp.  Both  the 
input and feedback signals should be negative before the summation point; however, in 
keeping with the convention, the input side of the summation is positive and the feedback 
side is negative.
