The tracks on each channel are grouped into sectors as illustrated in figure 2-16. Does this sound 
familiar to you? It sounds almost like the format used on disk packs when referring to tracks (or 
cylinders) and sectors. As the drum rotates, the reading or writing occurs when the specified sector of a 
given channel passes under the read/write head for that channel.
