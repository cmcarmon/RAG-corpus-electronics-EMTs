Small-signal analysis is an extremely useful technique that applies to all
physical systems with differentiable characteristics. In essence, it says that if we
operate within a small-signal discipline, the response of any physical system
to small perturbation will be linear! In turn, the effectively linear system is
amenable to linear analysis techniques, such as superposition.
