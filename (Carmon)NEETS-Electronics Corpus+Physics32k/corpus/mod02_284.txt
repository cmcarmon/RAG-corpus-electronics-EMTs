If the value of resistance and reactance cannot simply be added together to find the impedance, or Z, 
how is it determined? Because the current through a resistor is in step with the voltage across it and the 
current in a reactance differs by 90 degrees from the voltage across it, the two are at right angles to each 
other. They can therefore be combined by means of the same method used in the construction of a right-
angle triangle.
