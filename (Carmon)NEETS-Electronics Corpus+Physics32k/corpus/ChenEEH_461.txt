At this point, it is important to note that the ICCR permits a
self-consistent description of nonideal effects via those small-
signal quantities that can (a) be measured quite easily with
standard methods and equipment and (b) also determine the
dynamic (i.e., frequency and large-signal transient) behavior of
the transistor. Moreover, from a circuit simulation and numer-
ical point of view, the ICCR provides the basis of a continuous
description of the transfer current via a single-piece equation if
the charges are modeled continuously differentiable. For Si-
based HBTs, certain extensions of equation 5.17 are required,
which are discussed in SchroÂ¨ter et al. (1993) and Friedrich and
Rein (1999).
