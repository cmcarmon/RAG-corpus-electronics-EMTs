Bode diagram: A graph of the gain magnitude and frequency response of a linear circuit or system, generally
plotted on log-log coordinates. A major advantage of Bode diagrams is that the gain magnitude plot will
look  like  straight  lines  or  be  asymptotic  to  straight  lines.  H.W.  Bode,  a  well-known  Bell  Telephone
Laboratories researcher, published Network Analysis and Feedback Ampliﬁer Design in 1945. The approach,
ﬁrst described there, has been reﬁned by a number of other workers over the past half-century.
