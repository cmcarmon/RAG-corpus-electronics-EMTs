Instrumentation
Standards of performance evolved from recommendations by the American Medical Association in 1950 and
the American Heart Association in 1954 and 1967. These recommendations have been collected and expanded
into an American National Standard, published by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumen-
tation (AAMI) [1991]. The title of the document is “Diagnostic Electrocardiographic Devices.” This document
not only lists all the performance and labeling requirements, but also provides useful information on testing
ECGs and should be consulted by those contemplating construction of an ECG. Only some of the highlights
of the standard will be presented here.
