Here we have noted again that a completely Ô¨Ålled band does not contribute to the current density. The picture

emerging from (22.3) is that of particles (known as 
those of missing electrons. The concentration of holes in the valence band is controlled by adding acceptor-
type impurities (such as boron in silicon), which form local energy levels close to the top of the valence band.
At room temperature these energy levels are occupied by electrons that come from the valence band and leave
