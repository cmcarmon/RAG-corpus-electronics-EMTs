The ﬁrst term in 4.67 computes the incident power, the second
term corresponds to the reﬂected power, and the third term
represents the interference between these two waves. Note that
for a lossless line, since u0 ¼ 0, the interaction term will
vanish, and the power transferred to the load reduces to the
difference between incident and reﬂected contributions.
