This  means  that  we  may  replace  the  circuit  in  Fig.  2.31  with  that  in
Fig.  2.32.  Notice  the  similarity  between  Eqs.  (2.30)  and  (2.40). The
equivalent conductance of parallel resistors is obtained the same way
as  the  equivalent  resistance  of  series  resistors.  In  the  same  manner,
the  equivalent  conductance  of  resistors  in  series  is  obtained  just
the same  way  as  the  resistance  of  resistors  in  parallel.  Thus  the
equivalent conductance 
of N resistors in series (such as shown in
Fig. 2.29) is
