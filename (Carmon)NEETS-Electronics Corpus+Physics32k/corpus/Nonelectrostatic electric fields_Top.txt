Non electrostatic electric fields are very much like the electrostatic electric fields, except that their origin is based on electromagnetic induction i.e. time varying magnetic field through a given region of space induces non-electrostatic electric fields. The striking difference between the two kinds of fields is that we cannot associate electric potential with points in such an electric field and that the work done by the electric force in such a field is not zero over a closed loop.[1]
