For hv > Eg, the quantum efﬁciency Qe is often fairly close to
unity.
Under equilibrium conditions, G ¼ R, where R is the re-
combination rate; that is, the generation of electron-hole pairs
is balanced by different recombination processes that include
direct (band-to-band) radiative recombination, radiative
band-to-impurity recombination, nonradiative recombin-
ation via impurity (trap) levels, Auger recombination, and
surface recombination. These processes (except for the Auger
recombination discussed below) are schematically shown in
Figure 6.13.
