Design Strategies
Design strategies such as lead minimization through component selection, and the reduction of waste resulting
from  rapid  technological  evolution  through  modular  design,  help  to  minimize  the  environmental  impact  of
electronic products. Although at this time no suitable lead-free alternatives exist for electronic interconnections,
designers  can  still  minimize  the  lead  content  of  electronic  designs.  Surface  mount  technology  requires  less
solder than through-hole technology. New interconnection technologies, such as microball grid array and direct
chip attachment, also require less solder. The environmental beneÔ¨Åts increase with the use of these advanced
interconnection technologies.
