In many applications, sharp directivity is desirable although no need exists for added gain. Examine 
the physical disposition of the units shown in figure 4-23. Transmitters 1 and 2 are sending information to 
receivers 1 and 2, respectively, along the paths shown by the solid arrows. The distance between 
transmitter 1 and receiver 1 or between transmitter 2 and receiver 2 is short and does not require high-
power transmission. The antennas of the transmitters propagate well in all directions. However, receiver 1 
picks up some of the signals from transmitter 2, and receiver 2 picks up some of the signals from 
transmitter 1, as shown by the broken arrows. This effect is emphasized if the receiving antennas intercept 
energy equally well in all directions.
