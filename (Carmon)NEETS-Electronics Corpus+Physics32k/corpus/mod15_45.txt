Torque-synchro systems are classified "torque" because they are mainly concerned with the torque or 
turning force required to move light loads such as dials, pointers, or similar indicators. The positioning of 
these devices requires a relatively low amount of torque. Control synchros are used in systems that are 
designed to move heavy loads such as gun directors, radar antennas, and missile launchers.
