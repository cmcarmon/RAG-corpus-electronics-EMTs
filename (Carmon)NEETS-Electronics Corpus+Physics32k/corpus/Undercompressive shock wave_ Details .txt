Ordinary shock waves are stable, that is the speeds of characteristic behind the shock are greater than that of the shock itself, which is greater than the characteristics in front of the shock. The characteristic speed is the speed of small, travelling perturbations. These conditions are necessary for a shock wave to remain and not decay. If the peak of a wave moves faster than at its base, then the wave front becomes self-sharpening and eventually becomes a nearly discontinuous shock, a sharp wave front which remains so when it travels.
A shock wave is undercompressive if these conditions are not fulfilled. A solution exists where a sharp wave front may remain sharp whilst travelling even when perturbations behind the front travel slower than it.
An experiment can be made to show this with travelling liquid steps : a thick film is spread on a thin one. The liquid steps remain sharp when they travel because the spreading is enhanced by the Marangoni effect. Making little perturbations with the tip of a hair, one can see whether shock waves are compressive or undercompressive.
