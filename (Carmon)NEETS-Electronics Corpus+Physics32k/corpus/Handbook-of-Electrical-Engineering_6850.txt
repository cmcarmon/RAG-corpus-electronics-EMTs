not possible to specify accurate statistical models for signals or noise, and so it is of interest to design detection
procedures  that  do  not  rely  heavily  on  such  models.  Of  course,  the  parametrized  models  described  in  the
foregoing  paragraphs  allow  for  uncertainty  in  the  statistics  of  the  observations.  Such  models  are  known  as
parametric models, because the set of possible distributions can be parametrized by a Ô¨Ånite set of real parameters.
While parametric models can be used to describe many types of modeling uncertainty, composite models
in which the set of possible distributions is much broader than a parametric model would allow are sometimed
more realistic in practice. Such models are termed nonparametric models. For example, one might be able to
assume only some very coarse model for the noise, such as that it is symmetrically distributed. A wide variety
of useful and powerful detectors have been developed for signal-detection problems that cannot be parame-
trized.  These  are  basically  of  two  types:  robust  and  nonparametric.  Robust  detectors  are  those  designed  to
perform well despite small, but potentially damaging, nonparametric deviations from a nominal parametric
model,  whereas  nonparametric  detectors  are  designed  to  achieve  constant  false-alarm  probability  over  very
wide classes of noise statistics.
