Autonomy
,  the  extent  to  which  the  vehicle  determines  its  own  position  and  velocity  without  external
aids.  Autonomy  is  important  to  certain  military  vehicles  and  to  civil  vehicles  operating  in  areas  of
inadequate radio-navigation coverage.
 in calculating position and velocity, caused by computational and sensor delays.

coverage
.  Radio  systems  operating  below  100  kHz  can  be  received  beyond  line  of  sight  on
earth; those operating above 100 MHz are conﬁned to line of sight. On other planets, new navigation
aids—perhaps navigation satellites or ground stations—will be installed,
Automation
.  The  vehicle’s  operator  (on-board  crew  or  ground  controller)  receives  a  direct  reading  of
position,  velocity,  and  equipment  status,  usually  without  human  intervention.  The  navigator’s  crew
station disappeared in aircraft in the 1970s. Human navigators are becoming scarce, even on ships, in
the 1990s, because electronic equipment automatically selects stations, calculates waypoint steering, and
accommodates failures.
