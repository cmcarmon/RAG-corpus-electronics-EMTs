Since the series-tuned circuit acts as an inductor above the resonant point, the crystal unit becomes 
equivalent to an inductor and is parallel with the equivalent capacitor C1 (view (B) of figure 2-20). At 
some frequency above the series-resonant point, the crystal unit will act as a parallel-tuned circuit. A 
parallel-tuned circuit has a MAXIMUM impedance at the parallel-resonant frequency and acts inductively 
below parallel resonance (figure 2-21). Therefore, at some frequency, depending upon the cut of the 
crystal, the crystal unit will act as a parallel-tuned circuit.
