(usually  two  leads)  or  in  intensive  care  monitoring  at  the  bedside  (usually  one  or  two  leads)  or  telemetered
within regions of the hospital from patients who are not conÔ¨Åned to bed (one lead). The recording electronics
of  these  ECG  systems  have  followed  the  typical  evolution  of  modern  instrumentation,  e.g.,  vacuum  tubes,
transistors, ICs, and microprocessors.
