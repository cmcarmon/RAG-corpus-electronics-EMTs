The signal to the other channel is amplified and detected with no delay introduced. This channel
includes an attenuating network that introduces the same amount of attenuation as does the delay line in
the delayed video channel. The resulting nondelayed video signal is combined in opposite polarity with
the delayed signal. The amplitude difference, if any, at the comparison point between the two video
signals is amplified; because the signal is bipolar, it is made unipolar. The resultant video signal, which
represents only moving targets, is sent to the indicator system for display.
