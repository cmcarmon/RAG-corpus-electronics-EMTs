The use of the smaller size synchro permits the construction of smaller and more compact 
equipment. The most widely used frequency for airborne equipment is 400 Hz. It is being used 
increasingly in shipboard equipment as well. The newer gun and missile fire-control systems use 400-Hz 
synchros almost exclusively.
