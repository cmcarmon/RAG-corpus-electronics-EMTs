Example 10.2 
 
A logic circuit is to be constructed that will produce 
a logic 1 output whenever two, or more, of its three 
inputs are at logic 1. 
 
Solution 
 
This  circuit  could  be  more  aptly  referred  to  as  a 
majority  vote  circuit.  Its  truth  table  is  shown  in 
Fig.  10.16.  Figure  10.17  shows  the  logic  circuitry 
required.
