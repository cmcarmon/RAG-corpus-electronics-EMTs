Exercise 5.24
(Solution on p. 193.)
One of the ﬁrst analog systems we described was the ampliﬁer (Section 2.6.2). We found that
implementing an ampliﬁer was diﬃcult in analog systems, requiring an op-amp at least. What is
the discrete-time implementation of an ampliﬁer? Is this especially hard or easy?
