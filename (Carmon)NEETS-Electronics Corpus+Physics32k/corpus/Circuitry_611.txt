To  improve  matching  and  prevent  damping  of 
the tuned circuit (which results in a reduction in Q-
factor  and  selectivity)  the  collector  of  TR1
is 
tapped into the tuned circuit rather than connected 
straight  across  it.  Since  the  tuned  circuit  has 
maximum  impedance  at  resonance  (see  page  78), 
maximum  gain  will  occur  at 
resonant 
frequency.  By  using  a  tuned  circuit  with  high-Q 
factor  it  is  possible  to  limit  the  response  of  the 
amplifier  to  a  fairly  narrow  range  of  frequencies. 
The  output  (to  the  next  stage)  is  taken  from  a 
secondary winding, L2, on the main inductor, L1.
