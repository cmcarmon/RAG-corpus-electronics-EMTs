FIGURE 6.3 Flow Diagrams for the Design and Simulation (Horizontal Grey Rectangle) and for the Production, Packaging, Testing, and Use
of MEMS Devices (Vertical Grey Rectangle). Loops for designing and simulation, process design, fabrication and testing, and production and
use are shown by the solid and dashed lines. Figure adapted from Nagel (1999).
