Figure 16.3.12 illustrates the adaptive control process as applied to a motor-speed control
system, which is based on adjustments of the armature resistance. Using all of the data inputs,
the computer computes the optimum value of Ra such that the motor speed is appropriate to
the load. The signal corresponding to the computed value of Ra is in turn used to position the
potentiometer arm of the variable resistance. The actual armature resistance is then controlled by
the position of the potentiometer arm, which in turn may be controlled by a sampled-data version
of the position-control system.
