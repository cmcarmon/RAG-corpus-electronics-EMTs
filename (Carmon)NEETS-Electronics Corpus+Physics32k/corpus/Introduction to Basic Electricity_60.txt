Sheet	resistance	refers	to	the	measurement	of	the	resistance	in	a	thin	sheet	in	a
circuitâ€™s	components.	It	can	be	used	to	describe	the	resistibility	of	different	circuits
and	can	point	out	the	specific	difference	in	circuits	that	vary	in	size.	Especially	in
the	case	of	a	commercial	product,	the	topic	is	covered	for	the	assurance	of	quality.	
You	can	look	at	sheet	resistance	as	a	special	kind	of	resistance	since	it	generates	a
more	specific	value.	Usually,	the	average	resistance	in	a	circuit	is	expressed	in
ohms;	sheet	resistance	is	expressed	in	Ohms	per	square.
In	most	cases,	sheet	resistance	is	used	for	the	analysis	of	circuits	with	uniform
conductivity	or	semi-conductivity.	Typical	applications	are	extended	to	quality
