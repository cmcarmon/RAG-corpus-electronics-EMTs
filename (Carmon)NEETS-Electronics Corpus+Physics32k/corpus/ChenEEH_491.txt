Heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) show excellent
high-frequency behavior and are in many respects superior to
BJTs. Conventionally, HBTs have been fabricated in III–V
materials such as GaAs (Ali and Gupta, 1991); major applica-
tions of those HBTs are power ampliﬁers. More recently, also
SiGe HBTs have started entering into applications that used to
be dominated by III–V semiconductors; however, so far the
majority of those ‘‘HBTs’’ are actually transistors with an
increased drift ﬁeld in the base (Harame et al., 1995) rather
than ‘‘true’’ HBTs (Schu¨ppen et al., 1996) as shown in Fig-
ure 5.6(B).
