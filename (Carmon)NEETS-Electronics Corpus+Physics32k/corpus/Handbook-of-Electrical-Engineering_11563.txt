The visual system has the capability to detect a single photon of light, yet also has a dynamic range that can
respond to intensities many orders of magnitude greater. It can work with high contrast items and with those
of almost no contrast, and across the visible spectrum of colors. Millions of parallel data channels form the
optic  nerve  that  comes  from  an  eye;  each  channel  transmits  an  asynchronous  and  quasi-random  (in  time)
stream of binary pulses. While the temporal coding on any one of these channels is not fast (on the order of
