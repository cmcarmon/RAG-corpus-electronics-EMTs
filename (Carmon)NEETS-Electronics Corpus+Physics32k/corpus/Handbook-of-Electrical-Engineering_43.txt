Composition Resistors. Composition resistors are composed of carbon particles mixed with a binder. This
mixture is molded into a cylindrical shape and hardened by baking. Leads are attached axially to each end, and
the assembly is encapsulated in a protective encapsulation coating. Color bands on the outer surface indicate
the  resistance  value  and  tolerance.  Composition  resistors  are  economical  and  exhibit  low  noise  levels  for
resistances above 1 MW. Composition resistors are usually rated for temperatures in the neighborhood of 70(cid:176)C
for power ranging from 1/8 to 2 W. Composition resistors have end-to-end shunted capacitance that may be
noticed at frequencies in the neighborhood of 100 kHz, especially for resistance values above 0.3 MW.
