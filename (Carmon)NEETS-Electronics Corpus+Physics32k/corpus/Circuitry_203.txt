At  a  particular  frequency  (known  as  the  parallel 
resonant frequency) the reactance of the capacitor, 
XC, will  be  equal  in  magnitude  (but  of  opposite 
sign) to that of the inductor, XL. At resonance, the 
denominator in the formula for impedance becomes 
zero and thus the circuit has an infinite impedance 
at  resonance.  The  supply  current  will  have  a 
minimum value at resonance (zero in the case of a 
perfect parallel resonant circuit).
