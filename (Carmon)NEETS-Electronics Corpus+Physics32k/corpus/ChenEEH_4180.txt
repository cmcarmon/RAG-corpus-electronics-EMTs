. Time division multiplexing (TDM)—synchronous TDM:
Multiple digital signals or analog signals carrying digital
data can be carried on a single transmission path by
interleaving portions of each signal in time. The inter-
leaving interval can be one bit, one octet, or one block of
a ﬁxed size of octets. Each signal or connection path takes
a ﬁxed time slot but use the whole bandwidth of the link.
‘‘Dummy’’ information will be sent on the slot even if
there is no data for the connection. This wastes the
capacity of the transmission bandwidth.
