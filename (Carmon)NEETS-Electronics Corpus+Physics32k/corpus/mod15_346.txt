You have just imagined observing the gyro from space. Now, let's come back to Earth and stand 
right next to the gyro. Look at the gyro in view C. From your viewpoint on Earth, the spinning axis 
appears to make one complete rotation in one day. As you know, the gyro is rigid, and both you and the 
Earth are rotating. The effect of the Earth's rotation on a gyro is sometimes called APPARENT DRIFT, 
APPARENT PRECESSION, or APPARENT ROTATION.
