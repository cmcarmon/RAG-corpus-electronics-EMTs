The  information  needed  to  be  collected  is  inﬂuenced  by  the  target  audience.  The  most  detailed  internal
subsystem information is primarily used by engineers or specialized technicians to troubleshoot detailed failures
or ﬁne tune operation. A subset of less detailed information is used by maintenance staff to determine which
components  or  sub-modules  to  replace  or  repair.  A  further  subset  of  that  information  is  used  by  a  general
troubleshooting staff to determine which subsystem is malfunctioning or which higher level modules to replace.
An even smaller subset of operating status information and only a few major faults are needed by the operator,
with a selection of that data being useful to a central control or maintenance dispatching facility if real time
links are available. A variety of techniques are being used to present this information to the target audience(s)
in ways and at times that are most appropriate.
