The qi is the ith hidden node input of the critic network, and
pi is the corresponding output of the hidden node. The Nh is
the total number of hidden nodes in the critic network, and
n Ã¾ 1 is the total number of inputs into the critic network
including the analog action value u(t ) from the action net-
work. By applying the chain rule, the adaptation of the critic
network is summarized below.
