currents in the moving copper strip by the solid cones and the magnetic Ô¨Åeld by the gray scaled contours. This
modest problem was modeled with 5,664 degrees of freedom (No. of equations) and needed 198 cp seconds
running on a workstation rated at SPECfp92 96.5. However most industrial problems will require many more
degrees  of  freedom,  and  typically  a  non-linear  magnetostatic  problem  with  200,000  equations  needed
75 mintues  and  25  Mbytes  of  RAM  on  the  same  machine.  The  resources  needed  for  transient  non-linear
problems will be far greater.
