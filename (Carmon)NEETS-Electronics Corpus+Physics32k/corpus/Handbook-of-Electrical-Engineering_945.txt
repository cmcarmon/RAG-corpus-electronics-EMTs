Steps Involved in Device Characterization
Device characterization begins with a test chip. Without the proper test chip structures, proper device modeling
cannot be done from measured data. A good test chip for MOS technology would include transistors of varying
geometries, gate oxide capacitance structures, junction diode capacitance structures, and overlap capacitance
structures. This would be a minimal test chip. Additional structures might include ring oscillators and other
circuits for checking the AC performance of the models obtained. It is very important that the transistors be
well designed and their geometries be chosen appropriate for the technology as well as the desired device model.
Although a complete test chip description is beyond the scope of this book, be aware that even perfect device
models cannot correct for a poor test chip.
