the E ﬁeld is the same everywhere between the plates. As the
ﬁgure indicates, the charges on the plates are not uniformly
distributed. They are denser where the ﬂux density is greater.
Now, E ¼ V =d, and so the D ﬁelds (D1 ¼ e1E and D2 ¼ e2E)
are different. The
are given by
and Q2
Q1 ¼ D1A1 ¼ e1VA1=d and Q2 ¼ D2A2 ¼ e2VA2=d, so the
total capacitance (Q1 þ Q2)=V is given by:
