Campbell's theorem, also known as Campbellâ€™s embedding theorem and the Campbell-Magaarrd theorem, is a mathematical theorem that evaluates the asymptotic distribution of random impulses acting with a determined intensity on a damped system. The theorem guarantees that any n-dimensional Riemannian manifold can be locally embedded in an (n + 1)-dimensional Ricci-flat Riemannian manifold.
