If you increase the current through a coil, you increase the ampere-turns. By increasing the ampere-
turns you increase the magnetizing force. At some point, this causes a decrease in the permeability of the
core. With the permeability of the core decreased, the inductance of the coil decreases. As said before, a
decrease in the inductance causes an increase in power through the load. A device that uses this
arrangement is called a SATURABLE-CORE REACTOR or SATURABLE REACTOR.
