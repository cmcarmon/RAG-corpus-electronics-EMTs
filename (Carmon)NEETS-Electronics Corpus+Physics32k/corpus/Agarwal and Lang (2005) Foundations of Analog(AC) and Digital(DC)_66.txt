Engineering is the purposeful use of science. Science provides an understanding
of natural phenomena. Scientific study involves experiment, and scientific laws
are concise statements or equations that explain the experimental data. The
laws of physics can be viewed as a layer of abstraction between the experimental
data and the practitioners who want to use specific phenomena to achieve their
goals, without having to worry about the specifics of the experiments and
the data that inspired the laws. Abstractions are constructed with a particular
set of goals in mind, and they apply when appropriate constraints are met.
For example, Newton’s laws of motion are simple statements that relate the
dynamics of rigid bodies to their masses and external forces. They apply under
certain constraints, for example, when the velocities are much smaller than the
speed of light. Scientific abstractions, or laws such as Newton’s, are simple and
easy to use, and enable us to harness and use the properties of nature.
