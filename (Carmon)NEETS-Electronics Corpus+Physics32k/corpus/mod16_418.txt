In making resistance tests, take into account that other circuits containing resistances and
capacitances may be in parallel with the circuit to be measured. Erroneous conclusions may be drawn
from readings obtained in such cases. Remember, a capacitor blocks the dc flow from the ohmmeter. To
obtain an accurate reading when other parts are connected across the suspected circuit, disconnect one end
of the circuit to be measured from the equipment. For example, many of the resistors in major
components and subassemblies are connected across transformer windings. To obtain a valid resistance
measurement, you must isolate the resistors to be measured from the shunt resistances of the coils of the
transformers.
