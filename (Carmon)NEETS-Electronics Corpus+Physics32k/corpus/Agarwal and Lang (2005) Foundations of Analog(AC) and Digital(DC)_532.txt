As in the Th√©venin derivation, this equation can be interpreted in terms
of a circuit. It states that the terminal current is the sum of two components:
a current source isc and a resistor current vtest/Rt. Hence the Norton equiv-
alent network, Figure 3.76, has a current source in parallel with a resistor.
Examination of either the two equations, Equations 3.121 and 3.115, or the
two figures, Figures 3.56 and 3.76 show that there is a simple relation between
voc and isc. Working from the figures, we can calculate the open-circuit voltage
of each circuit to find
