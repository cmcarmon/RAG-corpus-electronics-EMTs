ports,  external  circuitry  will  normally  be  required 
to  drive  anything  other  than  the  most  modest  of 
typical 
loads.  Figure  16.27

types  of 
medium-  and  high-current  load.  Fig.  16.27(a) 
shows  how  an  NPN  transistor  can  be  used  to 
operate  a 
the  relay 
requires an appreciable operating current (say, 150 
mA,  or  more)  a  plastic  encapsulated  Darlington 
power transistor should be used as shown in Figure 
16.27(b). Alternatively, a power MOSFET may be 
preferred, as shown in Fig. 16.27(c). Such devices 
offer  very  low  values  of  ‘on’  resistance  coupled 
with  a  very  high  ‘off’  resistance.  Furthermore, 
unlike  conventional  bipolar  transistors,  a  power 
FET will impose a negligible load on an I/O port. 
Figure 16.27(d) shows a filament lamp driver based 
on  a  plastic  Darlington  power  transistor.  This 
circuit  will  drive  lamps  rated  at  up  to  24  V,  500 
mA. Finally, where visual indication of the state of 
a relay is desirable it is a simple  matter to add an 
LED indicator to the driver stage, as shown in Fig. 
16.28.
