For particles in a system with periodic boundary conditions two particles can be neighbours even though they are on opposite sides of the system. This occurs often in molecular dynamics simulations, for example, in which clusters form at random locations and sometimes neighbouring atoms cross the periodic boundary. When a cluster straddles the periodic boundary, a naive calculation of the center of mass will be incorrect. A generalized method for calculating the center of mass for periodic systems is to treat each coordinate, x and y and/or z, as if it were on a circle instead of a line. The calculation takes every particle's x coordinate and maps it to an angle,

{\displaystyle \theta _{i}={\frac {x_{i}}{x_{max}}}2\pi }

where xmax is the system size in the x direction and

{\displaystyle x_{i}\in [0,x_{max})}
. From this angle, two new points

{\displaystyle (\xi _{i},\zeta _{i})}
can be generated, which can be weighted by the mass of the particle

In the

and

{\displaystyle \zeta _{i}}
values from all the particles, the averages

{\displaystyle {\overline {\xi }}}
and

{\displaystyle {\overline {\zeta }}}
are calculated. These values are mapped back into a new angle,





θ

{\displaystyle {\overline {\theta }}}
, from which the x coordinate of the center of mass can be obtained:

The process can be repeated for all dimensions of the system to determine the complete center of mass. The utility of the algorithm is that it allows the mathematics to determine where the "best" center of mass is, instead of guessing or using cluster analysis to "unfold" a cluster straddling the periodic boundaries. It must be noted that if both average values are zero,

{\displaystyle ({\overline {\xi }},{\overline {\zeta }})=(0,0)}

{\displaystyle {\overline {\theta }}}
is undefined. This is a correct result, because it only occurs when all particles are exactly evenly spaced. In that condition, their x coordinates are mathematically identical in a periodic system.
