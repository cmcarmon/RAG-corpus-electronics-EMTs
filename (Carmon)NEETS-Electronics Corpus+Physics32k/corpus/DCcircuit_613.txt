Next, we need a failure scenario. Let’s suppose that resistor R2 were to fail shorted. We will
assume that all other components maintain their original values. Because we’ll be analyzing
this circuit qualitatively rather than quantitatively, we won’t be inserting any real numbers
into the table. For any quantity unchanged after the component failure, we’ll use the word
”same” to represent ”no change from before.” For any quantity that has changed as a result
of the failure, we’ll use a down arrow for ”decrease” and an up arrow for ”increase.” As usual,
we start by ﬁlling in the spaces of the table for individual resistances and total voltage, our
”given” values:
