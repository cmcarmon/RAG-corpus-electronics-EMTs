Point defects are located and measured using EIA/TIA-455-59. Test personnel must enter the
appropriate input parameters including the source wavelength, the pulse duration, and the fiber or cable
group index into the OTDR. The nature of fiber point defects depends on the value of each parameter
entered by the end user. The pulse duration usually limits the length of the point defect while other input
parameters, such as the wavelength, can vary its shape.
