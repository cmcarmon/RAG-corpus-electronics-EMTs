Given that the normal length of signatures used varies between k = 16 and k = 32, the probability of aliasing
is minimal and considered acceptable in practice. In MISR, the length of the compactor also depends on the
number  of  outputs  tested.  If  the  number  of  outputs  is  greater  than  the  length  of  the  MISR,  algorithms  or
heuristics exist for combining outputs with EXOR trees before feeding them to the compactor. If the number
of outputs is much smaller, various choices can be evaluated. The amount of aliasing that actually occurs in a
particular  circuit  can  be  computed  by  full  fault  simulation,  that  is,  by  injecting  each  possible  fault  into  a
simulated circuit and computing the resulting signature. Changes in aliasing can be achieved by changing the
polynomial  used  to  deÔ¨Åne  the  compactor.  It  has  been  shown  that  primitive  polynomials,  essential  for  the
generation of exhaustive input generators (see above), also possess better aliasing characteristics.
