On the other hand, not all solutions of Eq. (100.56) are breakaway points. To satisfy as a breakaway point, the
point  must  also  lie  on  the  root  loci,  or  satisfy  Eq.  (100.37). Applying  Eq.  (100.56)  to  the  function  G(s)H(s)
given in Eq. (100.50), we have the equation that the breakaway points must satisfy,
