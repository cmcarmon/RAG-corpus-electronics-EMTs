In particle physics, the hypothetical dilaton particle, and scalar field, appears in theories with extra dimensions when the volume of the compactified dimensions varies. It appears as a radion in Kaluza–Klein theory's compactifications of extra dimensions. A particle of a scalar field Φ, a scalar field that always comes with gravity, and in a dynamical field the resulting dilaton particle parallels the graviton. Furthermore, in Brans–Dicke formulation of general relativity, Newton's constant, or equivalently by natural units the Planck mass. is a constant.
