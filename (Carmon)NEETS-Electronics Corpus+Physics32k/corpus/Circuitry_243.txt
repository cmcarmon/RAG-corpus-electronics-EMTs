Variable capacitance diodes 
 
The capacitance of a reverse-biased diode junction 
will  depend  on  the  width  of  the  depletion  layer 
which,  in  turn,  varies  with  the  reverse  voltage 
applied to the diode. This allows a diode to be used 
as  a  voltage  controlled  capacitor.  Diodes  that  are 
specially  manufactured  to  make  use  of  this  effect 
(and which produce comparatively large changes in 
capacitance for a small change in reverse  voltage) 
are  known  as  variable  capacitance  diodes  (or 
varicaps).  Such diodes are used (often in pairs) to 
provide tuning in radio and TV receivers. A typical 
characteristic  for  a  variable  capacitance  diode  is 
shown  in  Fig.  5.12.  Table  5.3  summarizes  the 
characteristics  of 
common  variable 
capacitance diodes.
