The reduced stress tensor should best (hardly perfectly) describe the observed orientations and senses of movement on diversified fault planes in a rock mass. Therefore, by reviewing the fundamental principle of interpreting paleostress from the reduced stress tensor, an assumption is recognized: every fault slip in the rock mass is induced homogeneously by a common stress tensor. This implies the variation in stress orientation and ratio Î¦ within a rock mass is overlooked yet always present in practical case, due to interaction between discontinuities at any scale.
Hence, the significance of this effect has to be examined to test the validity of the method, by considering the parameter: the difference between the measured slickenside lineation and the theoretical shear stress. The average angular deviation is insignificant when compared with the total of instrumental (measuring tools) and observation (unevenness of fault surfaces and striae) errors in majority of the cases.
In conclusion, the reduced stress tensor method is validated when
sample size is large and representative (homogeneous data sets with a range of fault orientations),
sense of motion of is noted,
minimization of angular difference is emphasized when choosing functions (mentioned in section above), and
rigorous computation takes place.
