In a TDMA system, the radio spectrum is divided into time
slots, and in each slot, only one user is allowed to either transmit
or receive. It can be seen from Figure 7.2 that each user occupies
a cyclically repeating time slot, so a channel may be thought of
as a particular time slot that reoccurs every frame, where several
time slots make up a frame. Since the transmission for any user
is noncontinuous, digital modulation must be used with
TDMA. The transmission from various users is interlaced into
a repeating frame structure as shown in Figure 7.3. Each frame is
made up of a preamble, information bits addressed to various
stations, and trail bits. The function of the preamble is to
provide identiÔ¨Åcation and incidental information and to allow
