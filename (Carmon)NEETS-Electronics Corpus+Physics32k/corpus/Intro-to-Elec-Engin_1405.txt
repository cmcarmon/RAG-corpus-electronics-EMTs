Radio transmission consists of antennas at the source and at the destination. It requires the
signal to be modulated on a high-frequency carrier, which usually is a sinusoid. Driven by an
appropriate carrier, the transmitting antenna launches an electromagnetic wave that propagates
through space without the help of a transmission line. A portion of the radiated power is collected
at the receiving antenna.
