For example, the selective capture of particles by an aligned, thin-walled circular nozzle is given by Belyaev and Levin as:

{\displaystyle c/c_{0}=1+(u_{0}/u-1)\left(1-{\frac {1}{1+\mathrm {Stk} (2+0.617u/u_{0})}}\right)}

where



c


{\displaystyle c}
is particle concentration,



u


{\displaystyle u}
is speed, and the subscript 0 indicates conditions far upstream of the nozzle. The characteristic distance is the diameter of the nozzle. Here the Stokes number is calculated,
