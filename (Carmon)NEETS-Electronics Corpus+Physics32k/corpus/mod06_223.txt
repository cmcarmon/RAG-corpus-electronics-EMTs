The second type of self-biasing to be discussed is GRID-LEAK BIAS. As the name implies, bias
voltage is developed in the grid leg portion of the circuit. Bias voltage in this type of biasing is derived by
allowing the positive input signal to draw grid current through a circuit made up of a resistor and a
capacitor. There are two types of grid-leak bias commonly in use: SHUNT TYPE and SERIES TYPE.
Because shunt type grid-leak biasing is the simplest, we will discuss it first. Figure 1-25 depicts a
simplified triode circuit using the shunt-type grid-leak biasing. Before we begin the explanation of shunt
