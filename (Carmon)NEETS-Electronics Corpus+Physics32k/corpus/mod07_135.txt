Until now, we have mentioned only one application for the diode-rectification, but there are many
more applications that we have not yet discussed. Variations in doping agents, semiconductor materials,
and manufacturing techniques have made it possible to produce diodes that can be used in many different
applications. Examples of these types of diodes are signal diodes, rectifying diodes, Zener diodes (voltage
protection diodes for power supplies), varactors (amplifying and switching diodes), and many more. Only
applications for two of the most commonly used diodes, the signal diode and rectifier diode, will be
presented in this chapter. The other diodes will be explained later on in this module.
