{\displaystyle \displaystyle {\dot {q}}^{1},\,\ldots ,\,{\dot {q}}^{n}}
are called internal components of the velocity vector. Sometimes they are denoted with the use of a separate symbol

and then treated as independent variables. The quantities

are used as internal coordinates of a point of the phase space
