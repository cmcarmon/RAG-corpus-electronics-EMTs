current is reduced to acceptable levels at bandgap energies of about 1.4 eV and above. This phenomenon has
been successfully exploited in the development of room-temperature detector materials, including cadmium
zinc telluride (acronym CZT), cadmium telluride (CdTe), and mercuric iodide (HgI2).
Theory of Operation
Operating principles of room-temperature detectors are similar to those governing the more familiar cryogenic
semiconductor  devices.  Gamma-radiation  is  absorbed  in  the  material  and  generates  electron-hole  pairs  that
move under the inﬂuence of an applied electric ﬁeld to contacts and external electronics for processing and
production of the familiar pulse height spectrum. The process is shown schematically in Fig. 116.14. Funda-
mental to the charge-transfer process is the carrier mobility (µ) and the carrier life time (τ). The product µτE
deﬁnes  a  drift  length  (λ),  which  should  be  long  compared  to  the  inter-contact  dimensions.  Owing  to  the
substantially  higher  average  atomic  number  of  the  room-temperature  detector  materials,  the  probability  of
gamma-ray  absorption  is  much  higher  than  in  silicon  or  germanium  (see  Fig. 116.7).  As  a  result,  room-
temperature detectors provide greater detection efﬁciency per unit volume.
