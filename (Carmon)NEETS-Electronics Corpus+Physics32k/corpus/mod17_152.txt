The final stage of a transmitter is the power amplifier (referred to as the pa). In chapter 3 of NEETS,
Module 1, Introduction to Matter, Energy, and Direct Current, you learned that power is the product of
current and voltage (P = IE). In the power amplifier a large amount of rf current and voltage is made
available for radiation by the antenna.
