applied from anode to cathode, the diode turns on (conducts current).
This minimum turn‐on voltage is known as the forward voltage, and its 
value depends on the type of diode. A typical silicon diode has a forward 
voltage of about 0.6 V to 0.7 V, whereas forward voltages for light‐emitting 
diodes (LEDs) range from about 1.5 V to 4.6 V (depending on the color). 
(Check the ratings on the particular diodes you use in circuits.)
When the diode is forward‐biased, current, known as forward current, 
flows easily across the pn‐junction from anode to cathode. You can 
increase the amount of current flowing through the diode (up to the 
maximum current it can safely handle), but the forward voltage drop 
won’t vary that much.
