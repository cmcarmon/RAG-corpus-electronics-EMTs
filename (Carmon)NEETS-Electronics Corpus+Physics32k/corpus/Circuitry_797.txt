Carry  out  an  AC  analysis  of  the  amplifier  and 
determine  the  voltage  gain  of  the  circuit  (this 
should  be  the  same  as  the  ratio  of  R12  to  R2). 
Check that the voltage gain is what you would have 
expected.  Also  determine  the  maximum  input 
voltage before the output voltage becomes clipped.
