When measuring a component in a circuit, discon-
nect one end of the component from the circuit. This 
eliminates parallel paths, which result in an incorrect re-
sistance reading. The device must be removed from the 
circuit to obtain an accurate reading. Then, the ohmme-
ter leads are connected across the device (Figure 15-14).
Because the primary purpose of an ohmmeter 
is to measure resistance, it can be used to determine 
whether a circuit is open, shorted, or closed. An open	
circuit	has infinite resistance because no current flows
