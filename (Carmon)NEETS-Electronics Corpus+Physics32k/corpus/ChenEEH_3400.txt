To facilitate graphic representation of different types of
faults, circuit diagrams shown in Figure 9.1 are used. The
example is related to the faults on transmission lines and
covers eleven types of most common transmission line ground
and/or phase faults. To facilitate the presentation, multiple
fault types are shown on the same diagram.
