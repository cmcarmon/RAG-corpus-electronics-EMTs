For many reasons, the atria develop a rapid rate called atrial tachycardia or supraventricular tachycardia. A
very rapid atrial rate is designated atrial ﬂutter [Fig. 113.14(4)]. With both atrial tachycardia and ﬂutter, the
atrial contractions are coordinated, although the ventricular pumping capability is reduced owing to inadequate
ﬁlling time. The ventricles are driven at a rapid rate, and cardiac output is low.
