Color CRTs
The Shadow-Mask CRT
Color  CRTs  are  widely  used  in  commercial  television  and  for  computer  displays.  The  shadow-mask  CRT
[Morrell et al., 1974] uses three electron beams deﬂected by one deﬂection coil. The beams traverse a perforated
metal mask before impinging on the selected luminescent screen material, which is usually made of stripes or
dots of red, blue, and green phosphors. The arrangement of the electron optics and of the deﬂection system is
such that the three electron beams converge on the screen after passing through the shadow-mask, each beam
impinging on one color, red, blue, or green, only.
