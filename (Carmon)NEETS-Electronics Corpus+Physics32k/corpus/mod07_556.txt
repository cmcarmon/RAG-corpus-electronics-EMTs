d. DAMAGED RESISTORS OR CAPACITORSâ€”A resistor that is discolored or charred has 
been subjected to an overload. An electrolytic capacitor will show a whitish deposit at the 
seal around the terminals. Check for a short whenever you notice a damaged resistor or a 
damaged capacitor. If there is no short, the trouble may be that the power supply has been 
overloaded in some way. Make a note to replace the part after signal tracing. There is no 
sense in risking a new part until the trouble has been located.
