The basic bridges described up to now determined the resistive and reactive components of the 
unknown impedance; however, the vector bridge indicates the magnitude and phase angle. Typically, 
vector bridges require two null readings. Consider the basic bridge circuit of figure 3-5. The magnitude of 
the unknown impedance (Z X) is determined by the voltages applied across R and ZX and to the bases of 
emitter followers Q1 and Q2, which bias the balanced rectifiers, CR1 and CR2. Resistors A and B are 
equal in value. When R is adjusted to equal ZX, the voltages between points 1 and 2 and between points 1 
and 4 are equal in magnitude, and the vtvm will indicate 0 volts.
