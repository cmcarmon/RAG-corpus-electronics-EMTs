LFV is sought to be extended to all fluid or solid materials, providing that they are electrically conductors. As shown before, the Lorentz force generated by the flow depend linearly on the conductivity of the fluid. Typically, the electrical conductivity of molten metals is of the order of

S

m


{\displaystyle 10^{6}~S/m}
so the Lorentz force is in the range of some mN. However, equally important liquids as glass melts and electrolytic solutions have a conductivity of

giving rise to a Lorentz force of the order of micronewtons or even smaller.
