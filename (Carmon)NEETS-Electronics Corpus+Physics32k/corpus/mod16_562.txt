HIGH RANGE.The high range is designed to test resistance values between 3KΩ and 1MΩ. 
Figure 5-33 shows the signatures that would be displayed for a 3KΩ resistor, a 50KΩ resistor, and a 1MΩ 
resistor using the high range. Resistors that are smaller than 3KΩ will appear to be almost a vertical line. 
A 50KΩ resistor will cause a change in the angle of rotation of 45º, whereas the display for a 1MΩ 
resistor shows only a slight rotation that is very close to a horizontal line. Resistance values higher than
