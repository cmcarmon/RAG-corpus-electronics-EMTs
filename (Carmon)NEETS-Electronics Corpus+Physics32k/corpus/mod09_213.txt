An oscillator must provide amplification. Amplification of signal power occurs from input to output. 
In an oscillator, a portion of the output is fed back to sustain the input, as shown in figure 2-1. Enough 
power must be fed back to the input circuit for the oscillator to drive itself as does a signal generator. To 
cause the oscillator to be self-driven, the feedback signal must also be
