When it is on, a resistance RONn appears between its drain and source. In
contrast, the PFET turns on when its vGS ≤ VTp. VTp is usually negative (for
example, −1 volt). When it is on, a resistance RONp appears between its drain
and source. The drain terminal of the PFET is chosen as the terminal with the
lower voltage. In contrast, the channel terminal of the NFET with the higher
voltage is labeled as the drain.
As an example, an NFET with a threshold voltage VTn = 1 V turns on
when the voltage between its gate and source is raised above 1 V. A PFET with
a threshold voltage VTp = −1 V turns on when the voltage between its gate
and source is lowered below −1 V. In other words, the PFET turns on when
the voltage between its source and gate is raised above 1 V.
A CMOS inverter is shown in Figure 11.17. When the input voltage is high
(vIN = VS), the NFET is ON and the PFET is off, resulting in a low output
voltage. When the input voltage is low (vIN = 0), the NFET turns off and the
PFET turns on, resulting in a high output voltage.
