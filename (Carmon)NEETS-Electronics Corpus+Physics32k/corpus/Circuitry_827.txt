‘PIC16F877’  from  the  list  and  click  on  the  Select 
button.  Next  click  on  File  and  Load  Program.  
Select the file named adc.hex (generated as a result 
of  compiling  the  BASIC  source  code  shown  in 
Table 18.4) and click on Open. This  will load the 
program 
the  PIC’s  program  memory.  
  Click  on  Tools  and  Microcontroller  View  in 
order to open the window shown in Fig. 18.18).  If 
necessary, reposition the windows on the screen so 
that you can see both of them then Select the Rate 
and  Extremely  Fast  before  clicking  on  Simulation 
and Start. The simulation will start immediately.  
  To  set  an  analogue  input  voltage,  click  on  the 
analogue (A) button associated with the RA0/AN0 
pin then use the slider to change the analogue value 
on this pin and click on Accept button to accept the 
value.  The  state  of  the  PORTB  pins  should 
immediately reflect this value. Repeat with several 
different  analogue  input  values  and  at  reduced 
simulation speeds in order to examine the effect of 
each program instruction.
