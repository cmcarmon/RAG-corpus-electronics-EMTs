in the home, ofÔ¨Åce, and factory. For the sake of simplicity, let us consider a single-phase induction
motor with a squirrel-cage rotor and a stator carrying a single-phase winding, connected to a single-
phase ac supply. The primary mmf cannot be rotating, but, in fact, it is pulsating in phase with
the variations in the single-phase primary current. It can be shown, however, that any pulsating
mmf can be resolved in terms of two rotating mmfs of equal magnitude, rotating in synchronism
with the supply frequency but in opposite directions (see Section 12.3). The wave rotating in the
same direction as the rotor is known as the forward-rotating wave, whereas the one rotating in
the opposite direction is the backward-rotating wave. Then the slip S of the machine with respect
to the forward-rotating wave is given by
