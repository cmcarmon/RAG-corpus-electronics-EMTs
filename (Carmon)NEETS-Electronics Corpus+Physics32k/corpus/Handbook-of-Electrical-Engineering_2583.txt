The MOSFET can be understood by contrast with other ﬁeld-effect devices, like the JFET, or junction ﬁeld-
effect transistor, and the MESFET, or metal semiconductor ﬁeld-effect transistor [Hollis and Murphy, 1990].
These other transistors modulate the conductance of a majority-carrier path between two ohmic contacts by
capacitive control of its cross section. (Majority carriers are those in greatest abundance in a ﬁeld-free semi-
conductor, electrons in n-type material and holes in p-type material.) This modulation of the cross section can
take place at any point along the length of the channel, so the gate electrode can be positioned anywhere and
need not extend the entire length of the channel.
