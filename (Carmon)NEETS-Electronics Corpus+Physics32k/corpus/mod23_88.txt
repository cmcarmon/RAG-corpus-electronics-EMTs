Magnetic tape is manufactured to have a specified output signal level (plus or minus some degree of
error). Level errors happen when the actual output signal level either drops or rises to a level outside the
expected range. For example, if a magnetic tape is rated for 10 volts ( +/- 10%), any output signal level
below 9 volts or above 11 volts is a level error. Level errors are caused by an uneven oxide coating on the
magnetic tape. This can come from either the original manufacturing process or from normal wear and
tear.
