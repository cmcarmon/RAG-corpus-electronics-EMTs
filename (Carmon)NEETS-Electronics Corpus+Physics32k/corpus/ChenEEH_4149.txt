In this section, we studied the modulation and demodulation
processes that are applicable to GSM and DECT (and its North
American variant PWT). Since baseband signals are can only
be transmitted over short distances with wires and require very
long antennas to transmit them without wires, the baseband
signals are modulated onto radio frequency carriers. First, we
studied amplitude shift keying (ASK) to determine its prob-
ability of error and methods for demodulation. From ASK, we
studied phase modulation and the speciﬁc form (p=4-
DQPSK) used for PWT. We showed that p=4-DQPSK has
the same shaped error rate curve as ASK, but the signal-
to-noise ratio deﬁnition is different. We then studied MSK, a
form of frequency modulation, as a ﬁrst step toward GMSK,
which is used for DECT and GSM. Based on the literature, the
error performance for GMSK also has the same shaped curve
as ASK with the proper deﬁnition of a correcting factor a. For
GSM where BT ¼ 0:3, a  0:9; for DECT where BT ¼ 0:5,
a  0:97.
