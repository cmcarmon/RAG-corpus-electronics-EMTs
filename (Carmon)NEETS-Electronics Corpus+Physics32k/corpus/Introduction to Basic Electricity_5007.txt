Traces that are too thin are fragile and have higher 
resistance than thick traces, and they handle less cur-
rent. Estimating how much current a trace can handle 
is important. Figure 48-17 shows a table comparing 
trace width and current capacity for a 1-ounce-per-
square-foot copper foil. These values are reasonably 
linear for different trace cross-section areas.
