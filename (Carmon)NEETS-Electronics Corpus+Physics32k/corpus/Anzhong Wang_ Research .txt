Wang's research recently has principally focused on aspects of gravitation, cosmology and astrophysics, using tools from general relativity, superstring theory and M-Theory. His recent work includes investigations of late cosmic acceleration of the universe, cosmology in string/M Theory, thermodynamics of black holes and their formation from gravitational collapse, the Horava-Lifshitz quantum gravity and its applications to cosmology and astrophysics.
