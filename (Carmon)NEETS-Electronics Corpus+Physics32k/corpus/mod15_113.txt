The torque differential transmitter (TDX) and the torque differential receiver (TDR) are 
ELECTRICALLY IDENTICAL. The only difference in their construction is that the receiver (TDR) has a 
damper, which serves the same purposes as the damper in the TR â€” it prevents the rotor from oscillating. 
The real difference in the receiver lies in its application. It provides the mechanical output for a 
differential synchro system usually as the sum or difference of two electrical inputs from synchro 
transmitters. As in the case with the TDX, the TDR addition or subtraction function depends upon how 
the units in the system are connected.
