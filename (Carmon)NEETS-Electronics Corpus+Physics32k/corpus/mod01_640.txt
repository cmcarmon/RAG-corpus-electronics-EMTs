In figure 3-62 (B), R1 has shorted. R1 now has zero ohms of resistance. The total of the resistance of
the circuit is now equal to the resistance of the parallel network of R2  and R 3, or 20 ohms. Circuit current
has increased to 6 amps. All of this current goes through the parallel network (R2,  R 3) and this increase in
current would most likely damage the components.
