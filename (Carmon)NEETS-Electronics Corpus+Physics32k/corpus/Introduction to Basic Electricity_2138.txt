Variations on the Wheatstone bridge can be used 
to measure capacitance, inductance, and impedance. 
Wheatstone bridge circuits are rarely used today to 
measure resistance values. They are now used for de-
signing sensing circuits such as strain gauges for 
transforming a strain applied to a proportional change 
of resistance, widely used in industry; variometers 
to detect changes in air pressure for alerting glider pi-
lots to updrafts or thermals so height can be gained 
allowing for longer flights; and explosimeters for 
sampling the amount of combustible gases in a space.
