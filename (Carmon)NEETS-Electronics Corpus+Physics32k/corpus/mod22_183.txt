A magnetic drum differs from a magnetic disk in that the tracks in which the data is stored are 
assigned to channels located around the circumference of the drum as shown in figure 2-16. That is, the 
channels form circular bands around the drum. The coded representation of data in figure 2-16 is similar 
to that used on 9-track magnetic tape, 8-bit code. The basic functions of the read/write heads are to place 
magnetized spots (those little binary 0's and 1's) on the drum during a writing operation and to sense these 
spots during a reading operation. The read/write heads of a drum perform in a manner similar to the 
read/write heads of a magnetic tape unit or disk drive unit.
