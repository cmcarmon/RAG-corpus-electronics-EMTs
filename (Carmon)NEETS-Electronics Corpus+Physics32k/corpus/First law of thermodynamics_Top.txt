The first law of thermodynamics is a version of the law of conservation of energy, adapted for thermodynamic systems. The law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system is constant; energy can be transformed from one form to another, but can be neither created nor destroyed. The first law is often formulated

{\displaystyle \Delta U=Q-W.}

It states that the change in the internal energy ΔU of a closed system is equal to the amount of heat Q supplied to the system, minus the amount of work W done by the system on its surroundings. An equivalent statement is that perpetual motion machines of the first kind are impossible.
