The replacement project was started on 30 March 2001 and completed on 7 March 2003 with the first day of public operation. The project contract cost Â£11 million.
The current AirRail Link is a cable-propelled double shuttle system. It is built on top of the previous Maglev guideway, slightly shortened by an extension of the railway station concourse to accommodate a low-level bus station. It uses the Cable Liner technology from DCC Doppelmayr Cable Car (DCC), and has two independent rope-hauled parallel tracks and a two-car passenger unit operating on each track.
The Birmingham Airport Link was DCC's first airport system and replaced the temporary bus service that had been operating since 1995. The new system has motivated passengers travelling to the airport to leave their cars at home and use public transportation.
The 585 m-long (1,921 ft) AirRail Link takes travellers from the public transportation interchange to the airport check-in in 90 seconds. It is a dual track shuttle with two stations, that consists of two trains, each of two cars, operating independently at a speed of 36 kilometres per hour (22 mph). The trains operate at a minimum headway of 120 seconds, consisting of a dwell time at each station of 30 seconds and a journey time of 90 seconds. The individual cars carry 27 passengers at 0.33 square metres (3.6 sq ft) per person, thus giving a capacity of 54 passengers per train.
