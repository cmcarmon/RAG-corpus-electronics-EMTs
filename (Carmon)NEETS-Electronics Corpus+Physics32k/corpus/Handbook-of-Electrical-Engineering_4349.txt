Let r1 and r2 be roots of p2(r) = 0 such that r1 < r2. A ray propagating in the core does not necessarily reach
the core-cladding interface or the ﬁber axis. In general, it is conﬁned to an annular cylinder bounded by the
two caustic surfaces deﬁned by r1 and r2. As illustrated in Fig. 42.10, the ﬁeld is oscillatory within this annular
cylinder and evanescent outside it. The ﬁelds obtained as solutions to Eq. (42.25) are
