8. Since 0.707 in decibels is 20 log 0.707 = −3 dB, the break frequency is also called a −3 dB
frequency. Since 0.7072 = 0.5, the break frequency is also called the half-power point. When the
magnitude curve begins to dip after the break frequency, the break frequency is also called the cutoff
frequency.
