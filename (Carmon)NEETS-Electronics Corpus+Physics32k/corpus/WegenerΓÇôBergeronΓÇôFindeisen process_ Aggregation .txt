The process of ice crystals sticking together is called aggregation. This happens when ice crystals are slick or sticky at temperatures of −5 °C (23 °F) and above, because of a coating of water surrounding the crystal. The different sizes and shapes of ice crystals fall at different terminal velocities and commonly collide and stick.
