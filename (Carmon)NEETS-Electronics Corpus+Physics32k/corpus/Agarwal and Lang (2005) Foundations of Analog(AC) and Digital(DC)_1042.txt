Inspection of the amplifier equivalent circuit in Figure 7.55 indicates that the input cur-
rent iB will be zero (and the ideal diode will remain OFF ) as long as vIN < 0.6. Thus
the output vO will remain at VS for vIN < 0.6. This fact is graphed in Figure 7.58 as the
horizontal straight line at voltage VS for vIN < 0.6.
When vIN exceeds 0.6 V by a small amount,7 the ideal diode turns ON, and current
begins to flow through the resistor RI. In this situation, the active region equivalent
circuit in Figure 7.56 results. In the active region, vO is given by
