Transactions scheduling based on locking achieves serializability in two phases. This is known as two-phase
locking. During the Ô¨Årst phase, the growing phase, a transaction can only lock new data items, but it cannot
release any locked ones. During the second phase, the shrinking phase, existing locks can be released, but no
new data item can be locked. The two-phase locking scheme guarantees the serializability of a schedule.
