where there are r distinct roots and q sets of multiple roots (each set has multiplicity ki). Note that r + s = n,
where s  D
i=1ki. Each distinct root contributes a term to yS(t) of the form cie lit, where ci is a constant, while
each set of multiple roots contributes a set of terms to yS(t) of the form (cid:229)
kiâ€“1ci,jt je lit, where ci,j is some constant.
Thus, the zero-input response is given by
