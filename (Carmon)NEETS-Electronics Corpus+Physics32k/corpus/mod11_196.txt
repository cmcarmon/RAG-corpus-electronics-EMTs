The CROSSED-FIELD AMPLIFIER (cfa), commonly known as an AMPLITRON and sometimes 
referred to as a PLATINOTRON, is a broadband microwave amplifier that can also be used as an 
oscillator. The cfa is similar in operation to the magnetron and is capable of providing relatively large 
amounts of power with high efficiency. The bandwidth of the cfa, at any given instant, is approximately 
plus or minus 5 percent of the rated center frequency. Any incoming signals within this bandwidth are 
amplified. Peak power levels of many megawatts and average power levels of tens of kilowatts average 
are, with efficiency ratings in excess of 70 percent, possible with crossed-field amplifiers.
