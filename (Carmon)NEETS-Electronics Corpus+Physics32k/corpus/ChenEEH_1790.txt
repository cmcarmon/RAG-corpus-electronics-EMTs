Bandwidth, as the most prominent QoS parameter, speciﬁes
how much data (maximum or average) are to be transferred in
the networked system (Wolf, 1997). In general, it is not sufﬁ-
cient to specify the rate only in terms of bits, as the QoS
scheme shall be applicable to various networks as well as to
general-purpose end systems. For example, in the context of
protocol processing, issues such as buffer management, timer
management, and the retrieval of control information play an
important role. The costs of these operations are all related to
the number of packets processed (and are mostly independent
of the packet size), emphasizing the importance of a packet-
oriented speciﬁcation of bandwidth. Information about the
packetization can be given by specifying the maximum and
the average packet size and the packet rate.
