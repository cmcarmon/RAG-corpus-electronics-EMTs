Because fluctuations in base current result in 
proportional  fluctuations  in  collector/emitter 
current,  you  can  think  of  the  transistor  as  a 
sort of variable resistor: When you turn the dial 
(by varying the base current), the resistance 
changes,  producing  a  proportionally  varying 
collector/emitter  current.  Thatâ€™s  where  the 
sistor part of the name comes from.
