MERIDIONAL RAYS.â€”Meridional rays can be classified as bound or unbound rays. Bound rays
remain in the core and propagate along the axis of the fiber. Bound rays propagate through the fiber by
total internal reflection. Unbound rays are refracted out of the fiber core. Figure 2-10 shows a possible
path taken by bound and unbound rays in a step-index fiber. The core of the step-index fiber has an index
of refraction n1. The cladding of a step-index has an index of refraction n2, that is lower than n1. Figure
2-10 assumes the core-cladding interface is perfect. However, imperfections at the core-cladding interface
will cause part of the bound rays to be refracted out of the core into the cladding. The light rays refracted
into the cladding will eventually escape from the fiber. In general, meridional rays follow the laws of
reflection and refraction.
