Relationship Between Ter and Spatial Temperature
Distribution Te(u, f)
Consider ﬁrst the special situation when the antenna is sur-
rounded by perfect absorbers, and the entire system is in
thermal equilibrium at the temperature T ¼ Ta, as shown in
Figure 6.7(B). Under this condition, the noise–temperature of
the antenna should be equal to the surrounding temperature.
Consequently, using equation 6.87, the radiation–noise tem-
perature of the antenna can be shown to be the temperature of
the surrounding objects T :
