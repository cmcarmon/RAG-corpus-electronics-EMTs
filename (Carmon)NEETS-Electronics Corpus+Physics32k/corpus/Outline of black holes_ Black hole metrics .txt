Schwarzschild metric – describes the gravitational field outside a spherical, uncharged, non-rotating mass such as a star, planet, or black hole.
Kerr metric – describes the geometry of empty spacetime around an uncharged axially-symmetric black-hole with an event horizon which is topologically a sphere.
Reissner–Nordström metric – static solution to the Einstein-Maxwell field equations, which corresponds to the gravitational field of a charged, non-rotating, spherically symmetric body of mass M.
Kerr-Newman metric – solution of the Einstein–Maxwell equations in general relativity, describing the spacetime geometry in the region surrounding a charged, rotating mass.
