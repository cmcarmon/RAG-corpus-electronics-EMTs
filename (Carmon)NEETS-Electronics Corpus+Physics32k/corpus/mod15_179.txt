There are various methods for zeroing synchros. Some of the more common zeroing methods are the 
voltmeter, the electrical-lock, and the synchro-tester methods. The method used depends upon the 
facilities and tools available and how the synchros are connected in the system. Also, the method for 
zeroing a unit whose rotor or stator is not free to turn may differ from the procedure for zeroing a similar 
unit whose rotor or stator is free to turn.
