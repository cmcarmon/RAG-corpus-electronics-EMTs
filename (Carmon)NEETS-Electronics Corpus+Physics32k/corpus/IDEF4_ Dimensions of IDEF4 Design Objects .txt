IDEF4 uses an object-oriented design method or procedure that is very similar to Rumbaugh’s Object Method Technique and Schlaer/Mellor’s Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOA/OOD) technique. However, there are some crucial differences:
IDEF4 is specifically designed to be compatible with other IDEF methods,
IDEF4 allows one to track the status of design artifacts from domain object through transition to design specification, and
IDEF4 includes a design rationale component.
These extra dimensions are shown in the figure. The edges of the box show the progression of the design from start to finish elaborating each of these dimensions.
