Hidden Markov Models1
Hidden Markov modeling is a probabilistic pattern matching technique which is more robust than DTW at
modeling acoustic variability in speech and more readily extensible to continuous speech recognition. As shown
in Fig. 15.18, hidden Markov models (HMMs) represent speech as a sequence of states, which are assumed to
model intervals of speech with roughly stationary acoustic features. Each state is characterized by an output
probability distribution which models variability in the spectral features or observations associated with that
state. Transition probabilities between states model durational variability in the speech signal. The probabilities,
or  parameters,  of  an  HMM  are  trained  using  observations  (VQ  codewords)  extracted  from  a  representative
sample of speech data. Recognition of an unknown utterance is based on the probability that the speech was
generated by the HMM.
