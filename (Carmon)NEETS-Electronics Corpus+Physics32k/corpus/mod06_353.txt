In view B, the source voltage has been raised to the firing point of 115 volts. This causes the gas to
ionize and 5 milliamperes of current will flow through the tube. Because the tube represents a resistance
(rkp), voltage will be dropped across the tube; in this case, 105 volts. The plate-load resistor (RL) will
drop the remaining 10 volts. The resistance of the tube at this time will be equal to:
