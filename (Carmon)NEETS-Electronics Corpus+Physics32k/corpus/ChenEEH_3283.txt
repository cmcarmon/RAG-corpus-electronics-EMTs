and it turns out to be possible, to continue to use the p–model
for the transmission line and simply modify the circuit pa-
rameters to represent the distributed parameter effects. The
relationship between the sending end voltage, Vs, and current,
Is, to the receiving end voltage and current in a p–model can
be found as:
