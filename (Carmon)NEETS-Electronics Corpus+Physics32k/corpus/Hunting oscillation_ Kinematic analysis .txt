While a qualitative description provides some understanding of the phenomenon, deeper understanding inevitably requires a mathematical analysis of the vehicle dynamics. Even then, the results may be only approximate.
A kinematic description deals with the geometry of motion, without reference to the forces causing it, so the analysis begins with a description of the geometry of a wheel set running on a straight track. Since Newton's Second Law relates forces to accelerations of bodies, the forces acting may then be derived from the kinematics by calculating the accelerations of the components. However, if these forces change the kinematic description (as they do in this case) then the results may only be approximately correct.
