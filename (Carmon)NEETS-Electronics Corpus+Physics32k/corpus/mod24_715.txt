A fiber optic receiver is an electro-optic device that accepts optical signals from an optical fiber and
converts them into electrical signals. A typical fiber optic receiver consists of an optical detector, a
low-noise amplifier, and other circuitry used to produce the output electrical signal (see figure 7-1). The
optical detector converts the incoming optical signal into an electrical signal. The amplifier then amplifies
the electrical signal to a level suitable for further signal processing. The type of other circuitry contained
within the receiver depends on what type of modulation is used and the receiver electrical output
requirements.
