maintaining a lock on the desired track. The signal that
controls the movement of this actuator is derived from
the reﬂected light itself, which carries information about
the  position  of  the  focused  spot.  There  exist  several
mechanisms for extracting the track error signal (TES);
all these methods require some sort of structure on the
disk surface in order to identify the track. In the case of
read-only  disks  (CD,  CD-ROM,  and  video  disk),  the
embossed  pattern  of  data  provides  ample  information
for  tracking  purposes.  In  the  case  of  write-once  and
erasable disks, tracking guides are “carved” on the sub-
strate in the manufacturing process. As mentioned ear-
lier, the two major formats for these tracking guides are pregrooves (for continuous tracking) and sampled-
servo marks (for discrete tracking). A combination of the two schemes, known as continuous/composite format,
is often used in practice. This scheme is depicted in Fig. 80.28 which shows a small section containing ﬁve tracks,
each consisting of the tail end of a groove, synchronization marks, a mirror area used for adjusting focus/track
offsets, a pair of wobble marks for sampled tracking, and header information for sector identiﬁcation.
