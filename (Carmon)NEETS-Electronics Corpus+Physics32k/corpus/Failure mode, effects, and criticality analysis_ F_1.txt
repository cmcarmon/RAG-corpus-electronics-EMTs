Failure effects are determined and entered for each row of the FMECA matrix, considering the criteria identified in the ground rules. Effects are separately described for the local, next higher, and end (system) levels. System level effects may include:
System failure
Degraded operation
System status failure
No immediate effect
The failure effect categories used at various hierarchical levels are tailored by the analyst using engineering judgment.
