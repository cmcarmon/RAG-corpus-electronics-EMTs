Best results are achieved when the instrumentation system is clearly understood, and its effects compensated
for  when  practical.  Lumped  parameter  modeling  of  the  elements  shown  in  Fig. 108.3  provides  a  means  for
determining the contribution each element makes to the overall system behavior. Of particular importance are
the input and output impedances of each element. In addition, the effects of interconnect and environmental
variables  can  also  be  modeled  to  determine  their  inﬂuence  on  the  system.  The  relative  dimensions  of  the
measurement system with respect to the highest frequencies encountered—whether signal or noise—determine
whether  simpliﬁed  circuit  theory  models,  or  generalized  solutions  to  Maxwell's  equations  must  be  used.
Generally, if measurement system dimensions are on the order of 1/20 of the shortest wavelength, simple circuit
theory models can be used. Operation in this regime also allows impedance matching to be largely ignored;

commonly encountered in high-frequency systems. Table 108.3 summarizes several common instruments and
input or output impedance models corresponding to Fig. 108.4. At low frequencies, interconnect can be modeled
by  ignoring  the  very  low  series  resistance  and  inductance  (Zs1,  Zs2)  terms,  and  considering  only  the  shunt
