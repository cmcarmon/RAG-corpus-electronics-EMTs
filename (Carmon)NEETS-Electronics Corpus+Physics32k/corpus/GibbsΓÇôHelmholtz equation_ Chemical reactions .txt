The typical applications are to chemical reactions. The equation reads:

{\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial (\Delta G^{\ominus }/T)}{\partial T}}\right)_{p}=-{\frac {\Delta H}{T^{2}}}}

with ΔG as the change in Gibbs energy and ΔH as the enthalpy change (considered independent of temperature). The o denotes standard pressure (1 bar).
Integrating with respect to T (again p is constant) it becomes:

{\displaystyle {\frac {\Delta G^{\ominus }(T_{2})}{T_{2}}}-{\frac {\Delta G^{\ominus }(T_{1})}{T_{1}}}=\Delta H^{\ominus }(p)\left({\frac {1}{T_{2}}}-{\frac {1}{T_{1}}}\right)}

This equation quickly enables the calculation of the Gibbs free energy change for a chemical reaction at any temperature T2 with knowledge of just the Standard Gibbs free energy change of formation and the Standard enthalpy change of formation for the individual components.
Also, using the reaction isotherm equation, that is

{\displaystyle {\frac {\Delta G^{\ominus }}{T}}=-R\ln K}

which relates the Gibbs energy to a chemical equilibrium constant, the van 't Hoff equation can be derived.
