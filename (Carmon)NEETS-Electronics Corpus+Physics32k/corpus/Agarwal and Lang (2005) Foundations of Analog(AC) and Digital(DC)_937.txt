The iDS curve in Figure 7.10 was measured keeping vGS constant at some
value greater than VT. It turns out that the iDS curves saturate at a different
value for different values of vGS. Thus, as illustrated in Figure 7.11, we get a
different iDS versus vDS curve for each setting of vGS (for example, vGS1, vGS2,
and so on), resulting in a family of iDS versus vDS curves. This family of curves
represents the actual MOSFET characteristics. Notice that the slope of each of
the curves in the triode region also varies somewhat with vGS.
