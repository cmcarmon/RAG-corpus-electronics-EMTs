where VD1 is the diode voltage at ID1. VD0 for silicon is about 0.60 V. rD is estimated from the fact that VD in a
real diode is changing per decade of current by m 2.3 VT. Thus, VD changes about 60 mV for a decade change
of current ID at m = 1. Thus in a 0.1 to 10 mA current change, VD changes about 120 mV, which corresponds
to anrD Â» 120 mV/10 mA = 12 W.
