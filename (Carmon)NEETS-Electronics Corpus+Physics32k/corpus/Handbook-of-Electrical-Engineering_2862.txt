One-part adhesives are easier to work with than two-part adhesives because an additional process step is not
required.  The  user  must  verify  that  the  adhesive  has  sufﬁcient  shelf  life  and  pot  life  for  the  user’s  perceived
process requirements. Both epoxy and acrylic adhesives are available as one- or two-part systems, and must be
cured thermally. Generally, epoxy adhesives are cured by oven-heating, while acrylics may be formulated to be
cured by long-wave UV light or heat.
