The Yukon Time Zone was a former time zone that kept standard time; Yukon Standard Time (YST) was obtained by subtracting nine hours from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) resulting in UTC−9. Yukon Daylight Time (YDT) when observed was eight hours behind UTC. In 1983 the UTC−9-based time zone was restructured and renamed the Alaska Time Zone.
