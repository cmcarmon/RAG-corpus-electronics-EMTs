For vIN = 1 V, 1.1 V and 1.2 V, vO is 6 V, 5 V and 4 V, respectively.
As a further exercise, we will go ahead and confirm that the BJT is indeed in its active
region for the highest input voltage applied. (Remember that the higher the base voltage
the more likely it is that the collector diode in Figure 7.49c is turned ON. Thus, we need
check only for the highest input voltage.)
