In an AM radio, the incoming RF signal is con-
verted to a constant if (intermediate frequency) 
signal. A fixed-tuned IF amplifier is then used to in-
crease the signal to a usable level. The if  amplifier 
is a single-frequency amplifier. Typically, two or 
more IF amplifiers are used to increase the signal to 
the proper level. The sensitivity of a receiver is deter-
mined by its signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio. The higher 
the gain, the better the sensitivity. Figure  38-18 
shows a typical IF amplifier in an AM radio. The IF 
frequency is 455,000 hertz. Figure 38-19 shows an 
IF amplifier in a television receiver. FigureÂ  38-20 
compares the frequencies of radio and television 
receivers.
