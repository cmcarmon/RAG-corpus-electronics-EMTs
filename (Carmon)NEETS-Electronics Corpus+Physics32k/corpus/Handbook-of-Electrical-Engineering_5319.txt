Typical thermoelectric generators employ radioisotope or nuclear reactor or hydrocarbon burner as the heat
source. They are custom-made for space missions as exempliﬁed by the SNAP (systems for nuclear auxiliary
power) series and the RTG (radioisotope thermoelectric generator) used by the Apollo astronauts. Maximum
performance over a large temperature range is achieved by cascading stages. Each stage consists of thermocouples
electrically in series and thermally in parallel. The stages themselves are thermally in series and electrically in parallel.

C. Silicon germanium alloys turn out better
Tellurides and selenides are used for power generation up to 600

performance above this up to 1000
to 10% range can be expected. Whenever small amounts of silent reliable power is needed for long periods of
time, thermoelectrics offer a viable option. Space, underwater, biomedical, and remote terrestrial power such
as cathodic protection of pipelines fall into this category.
