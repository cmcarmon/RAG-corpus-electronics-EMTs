In laying out a printed circuit board, it is best to 
start with a wide ring of 0.100- to 0.248-inch around 
the printed circuit board in order to form a ground. 
This provides large ground areas around the printed 
circuit board mounting holes, which are typically 
 located near the edge of the printed circuit board. 
This setup allows a star washer and a metal screw 
to make a good chassisâ€“ground connection. It also 
means that ground traces only have to go to any board 
edge,  simplifying the layout. If there is any concern 
 regarding ground loops with more than one ground 
current flowing in one conductor, it can be solved by 
cutting the loop.
