Jaro–Winkler similarity uses a prefix scale



p


{\displaystyle p}
which gives more favorable ratings to strings that match from the beginning for a set prefix length



ℓ


{\displaystyle \ell }
. Given two strings




s

1




{\displaystyle s_{1}}
and




s

2




{\displaystyle s_{2}}
, their Jaro–Winkler similarity



s
i

m

w




{\displaystyle sim_{w}}
is:




s
i

m

w


=
s
i

m

j


+
(
ℓ
p
(
1
−
s
i

m

j


)
)
,


{\displaystyle sim_{w}=sim_{j}+(\ell p(1-sim_{j})),}

where:




s
i

m

j




{\displaystyle sim_{j}}
is the Jaro similarity for strings




s

1




{\displaystyle s_{1}}
and




s

2




{\displaystyle s_{2}}





ℓ


{\displaystyle \ell }
is the length of common prefix at the start of the string up to a maximum of four characters




p


{\displaystyle p}
is a constant scaling factor for how much the score is adjusted upwards for having common prefixes.



p


{\displaystyle p}
should not exceed 0.25, otherwise the distance can become larger than 1. The standard value for this constant in Winkler's work is



p
=
0.1


{\displaystyle p=0.1}

The Jaro-Winkler distance




d

w




{\displaystyle d_{w}}
is defined as




d

w


=
1
−
s
i

m

w




{\displaystyle d_{w}=1-sim_{w}}
.
Although often referred to as a distance metric, the Jaro–Winkler distance is not a metric in the mathematical sense of that term because it does not obey the triangle inequality. The Jaro–Winkler distance also does not satisfy that axiom that states that



d
(
x
,
y
)
=
0
↔
x
=
y


{\displaystyle d(x,y)=0\leftrightarrow x=y}
.
