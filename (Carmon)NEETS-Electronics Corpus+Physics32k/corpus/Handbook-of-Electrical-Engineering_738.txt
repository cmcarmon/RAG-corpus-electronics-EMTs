Our immediate problem is to choose the network variables as the state variables in order to formulate the state
  of  the
equations.  If  we  call  the  set  of  instantaneous  values  of  all  the  branch  currents  and  voltages  the 
network, then the knowledge of the instantaneous values of all these variables determines this instantaneous
state. Not all of these instantaneous values are required in order to determine the instantaneous state, however,
because some can be calculated from the others. For example, the instantaneous voltage of a resistor can be
obtained from its instantaneous current through Ohm’s law. The question arises as to the minimum number
of instantaneous values of branch voltages and currents that are sufﬁcient to determine completely the instan-
taneous state of the network.
