There are two major techniques to remove  copper 
from a copper-clad board to form a printed  circuit 
board. The first technique involves using a mild acid 
such as ferric chloride or ammonium  persulfate. 
The other technique uses a  CAD-type program and a 
computer numerical control (CnC) machine to 
remove the copper and is  referred to as a nonchemical 
process. Environmental and safety issues are favoring 
the use of nonchemical copper removal techniques.
