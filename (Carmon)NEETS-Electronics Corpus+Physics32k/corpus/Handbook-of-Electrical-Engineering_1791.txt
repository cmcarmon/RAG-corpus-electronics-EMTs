Two important issues in transform coding are the choice of trans-
formation and the allocation of bits in the quantizer. The most com-
monly used transform is the discrete cosine transform (DCT). In fact,
many of the proposed image and video standards utilize the DCT. The
reasons  for  choosing  a  DCT  include:  its  performance  is  superior  to
the other fast transforms and is very close to the optimal Karhunen-
Loeve transform, it produces real-valued transform coefﬁcients, and
it has good symmetry properties, thus reducing the blocking artifacts
inherent in block-based algorithms. One way to reduce these artifacts
is by using a transform whose basis functions are even, i.e., the DCT,
and another is to use overlapping blocks. For bit allocation, one can
determine the variance of the transform coefﬁcients and then assign
the  bits  so  the  distortion  is  minimized. An  example  of  a  typical  bit
allocation map is shown in Fig. 17.18.
