Starting Methods for Polyphase Induction Motors
When high starting torques are required, a wound-rotor induction motor, with external resistances
inserted in its rotor circuits, can be used. The starting current can be reduced and high values of
starting torque per ampere of starting current can be obtained with rotor-resistance starting. The
external resistances are generally cut out in steps as the machine runs up to speed.
