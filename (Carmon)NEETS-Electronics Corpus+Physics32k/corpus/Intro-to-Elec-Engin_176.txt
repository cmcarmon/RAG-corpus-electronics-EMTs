Replacing the current source with shunt resistance by the Thévenin equivalent, Figure 2.2.3 is
redrawn as Figure 2.2.4, in which one can identify two elementary loops, or independent meshes.
By assigning loop or mesh-current variables I1 and I2, as shown in Figure 2.2.4, both in the
clockwise direction, one can write the KVL equations for the two closed paths (loops) ABDA and
BCDB,
Loop ABDA: I1R1 + (I1 − I2)R2 = V1 − V2
(2.2.5)
Loop BCDB: I2R3 + (I2 − I1)R2 = V2 − V3
(2.2.6)
Notice that current I1 exists in R1 and R2 in the direction indicated; I2 exists in R2 and R3 in the
direction indicated; hence, the net current in R2 is I1− I2 directed from B to D. An examination of
Equations (2.2.5) and (2.2.6) reveals a pattern that will allow loop equations to be written directly
by inspection by following these rules:
