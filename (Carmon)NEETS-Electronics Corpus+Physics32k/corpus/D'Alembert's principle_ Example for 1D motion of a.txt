To illustrate the concept of d'Alembert's principle, let's use a simple model with a weight



W


{\displaystyle W}
, suspended from a wire. The weight is subjected to a gravitational force,



W
=
m
g


{\displaystyle W=mg}
, and a tension force



T


{\displaystyle T}
in the wire. The mass accelerates upward with an acceleration



a


{\displaystyle a}
. Newton's Second Law becomes



T
−
W
=
m
a


{\displaystyle T-W=ma}
or



T
=
W
+
m
a


{\displaystyle T=W+ma}
. As an observer with feet planted firmly on the ground, we see that the force



T


{\displaystyle T}
accelerates the weight,



W


{\displaystyle W}
, but, if we are moving with the wire we don’t see the acceleration, we feel it. The tension in the wire seems to counteract an acceleration “force”



m
a


{\displaystyle ma}
or



(
W

/

g
)
a


{\displaystyle (W/g)a}
.
