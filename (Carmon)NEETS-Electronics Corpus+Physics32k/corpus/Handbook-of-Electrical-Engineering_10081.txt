Methods for directly adjusting control parameters based on the output error ec are generally not available.
This is because the unknown nonlinear plant in Fig. 100.61 lies between the controller and the output error.
Until  such  methods  are  developed,  adaptive  control  of  nonlinear  plants  must  be  performed  using  indirect
methods  [Narendra  and  Parthasarathy,  1990].  Figure 100.62  depicts  a  general  method  of  indirect  adaptive
control using artiÔ¨Åcial neural networks.
