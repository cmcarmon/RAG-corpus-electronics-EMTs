13.2.2 No-load and blocked-rotor tests are conducted
on a three-phase, wye-connected induction motor
with the following results. The line-to-line volt-
age, line current, and total input power for the
no-load test are 220 V, 20 A, and 1000 W; and
for the blocked-rotor test they are 30 V, 50 A, and
1500 W. The stator resistance, as measured on a
dc test, is 0.1  per phase.
