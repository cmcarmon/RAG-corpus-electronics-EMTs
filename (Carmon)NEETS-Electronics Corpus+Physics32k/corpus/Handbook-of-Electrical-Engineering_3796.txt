The parameters g, a, and b are called the propagation, attenuation, and phase constants, respectively, and j =
. When there are no metal or dielectric losses, g is always either purely real or imaginary. When g is real,
1–
Ez and Hz have constant phase and decay exponentially with increasing z. When g is imaginary, Ez and Hz vary
in phase with increasing z but do not decay in amplitude. When this occurs, the ﬁelds are said to be propagating.
When the dielectric is uniform (i.e., homogeneous), Ez and Hz satisfy the scalar wave equation at all points
