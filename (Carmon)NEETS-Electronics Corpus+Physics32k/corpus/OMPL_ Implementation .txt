OMPL is written in C++ but also offers Python bindings. The library includes implementations for a large number of planning algorithms, all of these being implemented on top of the same base functionality. The base functionality OMPL provides for planners is thread safe. Adding new motion planning algorithms to OMPL is easy, thus facilitating comparisons between existing algorithms and evaluations of new ideas.
