HVS 7 -- hyper-velocity star 7, otherwise known as SDSS J113312.12+010824.9 is a rare star that has been accelerated to faster than our Milky Way Galaxy's escape velocity. In 2013 a team under N. Przybilla wrote that the star had a chemically peculiar photosphere, which masked its origins.
The star was first cataloged during the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. It was identified as a hyper-velocity star in 2006.
