where e is the electromotive force across the coil and the negative sign is due to the
sign convention shown in Figure E.12.4.2. Noting that the ï¬‚ux in the magnetic structure
depends on two independent variables, namely, the current i through the coil and the
displacement x of the bar, one can rewrite the equation,
