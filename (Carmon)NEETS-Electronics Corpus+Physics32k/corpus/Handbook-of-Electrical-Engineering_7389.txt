The  preceding  paragraphs  describe  a  number  of  the  requirements  placed  upon  telemetry  systems  by  the
transducers and quantities being measured. Unfortunately, the development of telemetry has not been such as
to  satisfy  all  requirements,  and  in  many  cases  the  telemetry  system  seriously  limits  the  measurement.  A
compromise is therefore required between telemetry capabilities and the requirements of measurement. The
shortcomings and limitations of the telemetry system place restrictions upon measurements above and beyond
those encountered in the laboratory when the telemeter is not used. In the ﬁrst place, an electrical output from
the measuring device is required in order that the measurement may be placed on a radio link. Consequently,
transducers that produce an electrical output on one form or another are necessary. Also, the telemetry system
may not be perfectly stable down to zero frequency (dc), and transducers and methods of measurement must
be  chosen  to  minimize  the  effects  of  drift.  Overmodulating  the  subcarrier,  or  the  time-division  multiplexer,
may also affect adjacent channels, as well as produce erroneous data in its own channel. If various measuring
devices are switched, the switching transients must be minimized, or the accuracy of the telemetry system may
be  impaired.  When  mechanical  commutators  or  time  multiplexers  are  used,  the  measurement  of  the  time
occurrence of the event, such as the impact of cosmic particles or the receipt of a guidance pulse, is made more
difﬁcult and the time ambiguity of the multiplexed system is a serious limitation.
