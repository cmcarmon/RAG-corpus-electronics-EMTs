The Ohnesorge number for a 3 mm diameter rain drop is typically ~0.002. Larger Ohnesorge numbers indicate a greater influence of the viscosity.
This is often used to relate to free surface fluid dynamics such as dispersion of liquids in gases and in spray technology.
In inkjet printing, liquids whose Ohnesorge number is less than 1 and greater than 0.1 are jettable (1<Z<10 where Z is the reciprocal of the Ohnersorge number).
