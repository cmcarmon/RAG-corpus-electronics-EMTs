Figure 102.11 presents a block diagram of a typical SNG system. The RF subsystem has a transmit path and
two independent receive paths. The transmit path consists of an HPA and a frequency agile video exciter which
modulates and upconverts the video signal to the satellite’s RF frequency. A waveguide switch is used to select
transmit  polarization.  Camera  signals  go  simultaneously  to  tape  for  storage  and  for  transmission  over  the
satellite. A  receive  path  is  typically  provided  for  both  receive  polarizations.  Each  path  consists  of  a  transmit
reject  ﬁlter  and  an  LNB  which  downconverts  to  L-band.  The  received  L-band  signal  passes  through  a  video
satellite receiver, from which point it can be routed to various monitor or test points or be routed to a tape
device for recording and storage.
