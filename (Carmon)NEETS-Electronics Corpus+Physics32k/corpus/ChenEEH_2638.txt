The solutions to Maxwell’s equations can be sought directly by
solving related differential equations. Alternatively, they can
be obtained by solving an integral equation derived from
Maxwell’s equations. For example, in the electrostatic case, an
integral equation can be derived using the Green’s function
approach. A Green’s function is a point source response and,
in this case, is the potential produced by a point charge. As an
example, in the capacitance problem, where one is interested in
ﬁnding the total capacitance of a piece of metal, one can
formulate an integral equation to solve for the charge in the
metal. Using the Green’s function approach, one can write, by
the principle of linear superposition, the total potential due to
the charges on the surface of a metallic conductor as:
