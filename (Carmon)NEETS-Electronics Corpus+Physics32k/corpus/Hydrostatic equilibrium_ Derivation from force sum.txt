Newton's laws of motion state that a volume of a fluid that is not in motion or that is in a state of constant velocity must have zero net force on it. This means the sum of the forces in a given direction must be opposed by an equal sum of forces in the opposite direction. This force balance is called a hydrostatic equilibrium.
The fluid can be split into a large number of cuboid volume elements; by considering a single element, the action of the fluid can be derived.
There are 3 forces: the force downwards onto the top of the cuboid from the pressure, P, of the fluid above it is, from the definition of pressure,

p

P

⋅
A
.


{\displaystyle F_{top}=-P_{top}\cdot A.}

Similarly, the force on the volume element from the pressure of the fluid below pushing upwards is

{\displaystyle F_{bottom}=P_{bottom}\cdot A.}

Finally, the weight of the volume element causes a force downwards. If the density is ρ, the volume is V and g the standard gravity, then:





F

w
e
i
g
h
t


=
−
ρ
⋅
g
⋅
V
.


{\displaystyle F_{weight}=-\rho \cdot g\cdot V.}

The volume of this cuboid is equal to the area of the top or bottom, times the height — the formula for finding the volume of a cube.

{\displaystyle F_{weight}=-\rho \cdot g\cdot A\cdot h}

By balancing these forces, the total force on the fluid is

{\displaystyle \sum F=F_{bottom}+F_{top}+F_{weight}=P_{bottom}\cdot A-P_{top}\cdot A-\rho \cdot g\cdot A\cdot h.}

This sum equals zero if the fluid's velocity is constant. Dividing by A,

{\displaystyle P_{top}-P_{bottom}=-\rho \cdot g\cdot h.}

Ptop − Pbottom is a change in pressure, and h is the height of the volume element—a change in the distance above the ground. By saying these changes are infinitesimally small, the equation can be written in differential form.

{\displaystyle dP=-\rho \cdot g\cdot dh.}

Density changes with pressure, and gravity changes with height, so the equation would be:

{\displaystyle dP=-\rho (P)\cdot g(h)\cdot dh.}
