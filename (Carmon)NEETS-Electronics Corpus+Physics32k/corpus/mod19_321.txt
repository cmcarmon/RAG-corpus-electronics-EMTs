EQUIPMENT TECHNICAL MANUALS.Â—Technical manuals carry information essential to the 
proper operation, maintenance, and repair of specific equipment. These manuals may occasionally contain 
errors. In those cases, change notices are provided to correct the manuals. Updates because of equipment 
changes are also provided. These changes must be installed in the technical manuals to maintain accuracy 
and to prevent the loss of man-hours resulting from the use of obsolete data and/or schematics. The  
Guide for User Maintenance of NAVSEA Technical Manuals, NAVSEA S005-AA-GYD-030/TMMP, 
provides information on identifying, ordering, deficiency reporting, and updating technical manuals.
