The topological sector of STS can be recognized as a member of the Witten-type topological field theories. In other words, some objects in STS are of topological character with the Witten index being the most famous example. There are other classes of topological objects. One class of objects is related to instantons, i.e., transient dynamics. Crumpling paper, protein folding, and many other nonlinear dynamical processes in response to quenches, i.e., to external (sudden) changes of parameters, can be recognized as instantonic dynamics. From the mathematical point of view, instantons are families of solutions of deterministic equations of motion,

{\displaystyle {\dot {x}}=F}
, that lead from, say, less stable fixed point of



F


{\displaystyle F}
to a more stable fixed point. Certain matrix elements calculated on instantons are of topological nature. An example of such matrix elements can be defined for a pair of critical points,

{\displaystyle a}
