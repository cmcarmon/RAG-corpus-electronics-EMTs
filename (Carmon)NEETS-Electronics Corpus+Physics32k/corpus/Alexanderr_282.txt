Born near London, Faraday realized his boyhood dream by work-
ing  with  the  great  chemist  Sir  Humphry  Davy  at  the  Royal  Institu-
tion,  where  he  worked  for  54  years.  He  made  several  contributions
in  all  areas  of  physical  science  and  coined  such  words  as  electroly-
sis,  anode,  and  cathode.  His  discovery  of  electromagnetic  induction
in 1831 was a major breakthrough in engineering because it provided
a way of generating electricity. The electric motor and generator oper-
ate  on  this  principle.  The  unit  of  capacitance,  the  farad,  was  named
in his honor.
