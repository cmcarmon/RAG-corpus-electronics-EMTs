An original copy showing a printed circuit board 
(PCB) layout may be copyrighted (Figure 47-5). There-
fore, a PCB design (not including schematic diagrams; 
Figure 47-6) is protected by copyright. However, the 
copyright is weak because the printed circuit board is 
identified as a useful article under Section 101, and the 
industrial design copyright does not protect it in the 
United States.
