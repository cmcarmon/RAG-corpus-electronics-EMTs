For the same output the autotransformer is smaller in size, weighing much less than a two-
winding transformer, and has higher efÔ¨Åciency. An important disadvantage of the autotransformer
is the direct copper connection (i.e., no electrical isolation) between the high- and low-voltage
sides. A type of autotransformer commonly found in laboratories is the variable-ratio autotrans-
former, in which the tapped point b (shown in Figure 11.6.1) is movable. It is known as the variac
(variable ac). Although here, for the sake of simplicity, we have considered only the single-phase
autotransformer, three-phase autotransformers, which are available in practice, can be modeled
on a per-phase basis and also analyzed just as the single-phase case.
