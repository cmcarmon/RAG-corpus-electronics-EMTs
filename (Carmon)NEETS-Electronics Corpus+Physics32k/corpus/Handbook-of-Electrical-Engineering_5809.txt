The short-circuit test circuit arrangement is shown in Fig. 64.8. The objective is to derive equivalent circuit
data from the test data provided in Fig. 64.8. Note that measurements are made in winding “i”, with winding
“j”  shorted,  and  winding  “k”  left  open.  The  short  circuit  impedance,  looking  into  winding  “i”  with  the
transformer so terminated is designated as Zij. The indices i, j, and k, can be 1, 2, or 3.
