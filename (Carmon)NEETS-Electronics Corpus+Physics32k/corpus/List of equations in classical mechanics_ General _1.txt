The previous equations for planar motion can be used here: corollaries of momentum, angular momentum etc. can immediately follow by applying the above definitions. For any object moving in any path in a plane,

{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} ={\mathbf {r} }(t)=r{\mathbf {\hat {e}} }_{r}}

the following general results apply to the particle.
