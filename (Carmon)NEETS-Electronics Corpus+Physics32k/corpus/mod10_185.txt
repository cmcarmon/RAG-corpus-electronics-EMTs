To represent the magnetic field, lines of force are again used to illustrate the energy. Magnetic lines
are not drawn between the rods, nor between high- and low-potential points, as the E lines that were
discussed earlier. Magnetic lines are created by the flow of current rather than the force of voltage. The
magnetic lines of force, therefore, are drawn at right angles to the direction of current flow.
