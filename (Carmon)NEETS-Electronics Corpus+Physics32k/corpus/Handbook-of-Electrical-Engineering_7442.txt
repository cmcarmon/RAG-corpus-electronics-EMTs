It is often overlooked that simulation can be used to support analysis. Many people incorrectly view simu-
lation as a tool to be used only when a system becomes too complex to be analyzed using traditional analysis
techniques.  Used  properly,  simulation  goes  hand  in  hand  with  traditional  techniques  in  that  simulation  can
often be used to guide analysis. A properly developed simulation provides insight into system operation. As an
example,  if  a  system  has  many  parameters,  these  can  be  varied  in  a  way  that  allows  the  most  important
parameters, in terms of system performance, to be identiﬁed. The least important parameters can then often
be  discarded,  with  the  result  being  a  simpler  system  that  is  more  tractable  analytically.  Analysis  also  aids
simulation. The development of an accurate and efﬁcient simulation is often dependent upon a careful analysis
of various portions of the system.
