c) Now, assume that each of the wires connecting the output of INV A to each of the
inverters INV1 through INVn is nonideal as depicted in Figure 10.100. Model each
of the wires using the model shown in Figure 10.101. Assuming that the input of
INV A makes a step transition from 1 to 0, find the rise time at the input of any one
of the inverters INVi driven by INV A.
