In “nested” OS, none of the above functions are standalone. All
of them are, in great part or even totally, performed by OS. In most
cases,  the  reader  may  ﬁnd  in  an  application  area “script(s)”  per-
forming  needed  function(s)  by  calling  necessary  subroutines
within  OS,  but  rather  rarely  a  standalone  block  of  software  per-
forming an independently new function.
