Agreement on standard cable designs is difficult. Cable design choices include jacket materials,
water blocking techniques, and the number of fibers to place within the cable. The cable design chosen
depends on the cable's intended application. There are presently many types of fiber optic cables. Some
fiber optic cables are used in commercial applications, while others are used in military applications.
