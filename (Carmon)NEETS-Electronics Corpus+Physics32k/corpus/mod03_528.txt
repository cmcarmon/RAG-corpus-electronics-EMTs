In general, a relay consists of a magnetic core and its associated coil, contacts, springs, armature, and
the mounting. Figure 3-19 illustrates the construction of a relay. When the coil is energized, the flow of
current through the coil creates a strong magnetic field which pulls the armature downward to contact C1,
completing the circuit from the common terminal to C1. At the same time, the circuit to contact C2, is
opened.
