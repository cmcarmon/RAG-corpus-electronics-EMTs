The coupler is enclosed in an aluminum, airtight, pressurized case. Six mounting feet enable the unit 
to be attached to the mast of a ship at the base of a whip antenna. The coupler is pressurized with dry 
nitrogen to aid internal heat transfer and to prevent corona and arcing. All components of the coupler are 
secured to a chassis that is mounted to the case so that an air duct exists between the chassis plate and the
