where S is the symbol for the input/output relation (the
system). On the other hand, one may think of the physical
system symbolized by S as an interconnection of components.
Engineering experience explains that a particular S is deter-
mined by two factors: the types of components in the system
and the way in which the components are interconnected. This
latter observation on the physical structure of a system gives
rise to the component connection viewpoint.
