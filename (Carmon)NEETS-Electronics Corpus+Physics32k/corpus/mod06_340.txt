You know that great effort is made to produce a perfect vacuum within electron tubes. But, even the
best vacuum pumps and getters cannot remove all of the air molecules. However, the chances of an
electron hitting a molecule in a near-vacuum are very slim because of the great distance between the
molecules, compared to the size of the electron. An electron can pass between two molecules of air inside
the tube as easily as a pea could pass through a circle with a diameter equal to that of the earth!
