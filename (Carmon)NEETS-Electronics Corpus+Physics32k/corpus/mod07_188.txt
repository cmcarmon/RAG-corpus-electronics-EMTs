The CONDUCTION PROCESS in a SEMICONDUCTOR is accomplished by two different types
of current flow: HOLE FLOW and ELECTRON FLOW. Hole flow is very similar to electron flow
except that holes (positive charges) move toward a negative potential and in an opposite direction to that
of the electrons. In an INTRINSIC semiconductor (one which does not contain any impurities), the
number of holes always equals the number of conducting electrons.
