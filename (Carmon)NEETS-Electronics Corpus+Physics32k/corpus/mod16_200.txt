As discussed in NEETS, Module 2, Introduction to Alternating Current and Transformers, the phase
angle of the voltage and current must be considered for accurate ac power measurements. The
measurement of ac power is further complicated by the frequency limitations of various power meters. If
there is no phase angle difference, you can compute ac power in the same manner as dc power; that is, by
determining the effective value of the product of the voltage and current.
