Although overcurrent protection placement in a circuit may determine the relative shock
hazard of that circuit under various conditions, it must be understood that such devices were
never intended to guard against electric shock. Neither fuses nor circuit breakers were de-
signed to open in the event of a person getting shocked; rather, they are intended to open
only under conditions of potential conductor overheating. Overcurrent devices primarily pro-
tect the conductors of a circuit from overtemperature damage (and the ﬁre hazards associated
with overly hot conductors), and secondarily protect speciﬁc pieces of equipment such as loads
and generators (some fast-acting fuses are designed to protect electronic devices particularly
susceptible to current surges). Since the current levels necessary for electric shock or electro-
cution are much lower than the normal current levels of common power loads, a condition of
overcurrent is not indicative of shock occurring. There are other devices designed to detect
certain shock conditions (ground-fault detectors being the most popular), but these devices
strictly serve that one purpose and are uninvolved with protection of the conductors against
overheating.
