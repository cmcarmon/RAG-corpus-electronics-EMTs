In DC Comics' All-Star Superman by Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely, Superman encounters the Ultrasphinx, who asks "What happens when the unstoppable force meets the immovable object?", to which Superman answers "They surrender."
At Wrestlemania III, color commentator Gorilla Monsoon described the match of Andre the Giant vs Hulk Hogan as "The irresistible force meeting the immovable object."
In the film "Imagine Me And You" (2005) the irresistible force paradox is an occurring theme first mentioned by H and last referenced by Heck who compares Rachel's love for Luce as the unstoppable force and himself as the immovable object saying, "What you're feeling is the unstoppable force, which means I have to move."
In Knight Rider, KITT references the paradox when he was faced with the possibility of having a Head-on collision with his prototype version called KARR, who has most of KITT's abilities including a nearly indestructible body.
In DC's film The Dark Knight (2008), The Joker references the irresistible force paradox in both his final scene, as well as his final dialogue between himself and Batman. The Joker attempts to ultimately explain the reason for Batman's inability to shed his Batman identity, saying, "You just couldn't let me go, could you? This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object. You truly are incorruptible, aren't you, huh? You won't kill me out of some misplaced sense of self-righteousness, and I won't kill you because you're just too much fun. I think you and I are destined to do this forever."
