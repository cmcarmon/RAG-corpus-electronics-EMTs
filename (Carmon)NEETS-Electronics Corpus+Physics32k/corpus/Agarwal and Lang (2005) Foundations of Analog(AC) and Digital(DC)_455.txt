Because of this, the number of unknown node voltages in the circuit can be
immediately reduced by one since e1 and e2 can be determined directly from
each other using Equation 3.32. Consequently, the number of independent
statements of KCL needed to determine the unknown node voltages can sim-
ilarly be reduced by one. Thus, Nodes 1 and 2 in Figure 3.20 must together
contribute one statement of KCL to the first part of Step 3 of the node analysis
(namely, writing KCL for each of the nodes that has an unknown node voltage).
Further, this single statement of KCL should not involve i5 since i5 cannot be
determined from the element law of the voltage source in the second part of
Step 3 (namely, using KVL and element laws to obtain the currents directly in
terms of the node voltage differences and element parameters).
