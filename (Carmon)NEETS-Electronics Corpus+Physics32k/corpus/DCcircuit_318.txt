Either way, both sides of the load will be electrically common to the earth, allowing for no
voltage (potential energy) between either side of the load and the ground people stand on. This
technique of temporarily grounding conductors in a de-energized power system is very common
in maintenance work performed on high voltage power distribution systems.
