The computer algorithms used to solve the QP problems are
numerically exempliﬁed in this appendix for the circuit
example C1
introduced in Section 4.3. The algorithms
LMCS-1, LMCS-2, and CSD—introduced in Section 4.5—are
illustrated in Appendices A, B, and C, respectively. Note that in
all cases, the same ﬁnal clock schedule is achieved.
