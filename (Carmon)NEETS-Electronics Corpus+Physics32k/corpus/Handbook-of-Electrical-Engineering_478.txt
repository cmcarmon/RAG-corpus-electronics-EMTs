Two-port networks: Networks that are modeled by specifying two ports, typically input and output ports.
Two-port parameters: A set of four constants, Laplace transforms, or sinusoidal steady-state functions used
in the equations that describe a linear two-port network. Some examples are z, y, h, g, T, and TÂ¢ parameters.
