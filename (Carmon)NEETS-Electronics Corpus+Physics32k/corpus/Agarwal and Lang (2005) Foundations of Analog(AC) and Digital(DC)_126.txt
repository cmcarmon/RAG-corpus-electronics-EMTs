e x a m p l e 1.1 a l i t h i u m - i o n b a t t e r y A Lithium-Ion (Li-Ion)
battery pack for a camcorder is rated as 7.2 V and 5 W-hours. What are its equivalent
ratings in mA-hours and joules?
Since a joule( J) is equivalent to a W-second, 5 W-hours is the same as 5 Ã— 3600 =
18000 J.
Since the battery has a voltage of 7.2 V, the battery rating in ampere-hours is 5/7.2 =
0.69. Equivalently, its rating in mA-hours is 690.
