Schneider and Wagner (1999) found that the Yee algorithm has
a low sampling-density regime that allows complex-valued
numerical wavenumbers. In this regime, spatially decaying
numerical waves can propagate faster than light, causing a
weak, nonphysical signal to appear ahead of the nominal
leading edges of sharply deﬁned pulses. This subsection
reviews the theory underlying this phenomenon as related in
Taﬂove and Hagness (2000).
