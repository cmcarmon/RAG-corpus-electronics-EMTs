The comparator is used to provide a digital output indicating which of two analog input
voltages is larger.
It is a single bit analog-to-digital converter. The comparator is very
similar to an operational ampliﬁer but has a digital true/false output. Since the comparator
is basically an ampliﬁer, the op-amp schematic symbol is used, but to avoid confusion the
symbol C may be inserted inside the op-amp symbol.
