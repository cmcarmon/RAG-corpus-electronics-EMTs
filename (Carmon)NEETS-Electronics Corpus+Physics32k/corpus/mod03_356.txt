When you have obtained a proper replacement fuse, you must make certain it will fit correctly in the
fuseholder. If the fuseholder is corroded, the fuse will not fit properly. In addition, the corrosion can cause
increased resistance or heating. Clean corroded terminals with fine sandpaper so that all corrosion is
removed. Do NOT lubricate the terminals. If the terminals are badly pitted, replace the fuseholder. Be
certain the replacement fuseholder is the correct size and type by checking the parts list in the technical
manual for the equipment.
