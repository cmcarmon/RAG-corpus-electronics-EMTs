Carbon-zinc and alkaline cells are used primarily in portable test equipment, vomâ€™s, flashlights, some
portable radios, and beacon equipment. The carbon-zinc cell provides 1.5 volts and holds its charge for
approximately 1 year in normal service. The alkaline cell provides 1.2 volts and has about twice the
stored energy of the carbon-zinc cell of the same size. It also has a longer life at a higher discharge rate
than the carbon-zinc cell. You should discard both types of batteries at the first indication of weakness.
