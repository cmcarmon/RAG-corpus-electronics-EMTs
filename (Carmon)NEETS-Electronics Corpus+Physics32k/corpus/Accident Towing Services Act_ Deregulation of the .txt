The Minister also commented in the following terms about the deregulation of the trade towing sector provided in the Bill -

"Finally, the Bill removes the regulation of trade towing, which encompasses breakdown, clear away zones and non-accident tows. This is consistent with the position in other major States. The Government has found that there is no case for regulation of this sector as the trade towing market is already highly competitive and consumers are able to make an informed choice of trade towing services. This can be clearly contrasted with the accident towing services market. Further, licensing of trade towing is currently 'as of right', attracting nominal fees, thus ensuring that there is no capacity for the licensing authority to refuse a licence. Deregulation will remove unnecessary costs to trade towing businesses and the initiative demonstrates again that the government is fully committed to removing excessive red tape and unnecessary regulation on business.
