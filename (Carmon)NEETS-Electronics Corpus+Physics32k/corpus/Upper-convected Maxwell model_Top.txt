The upper-convected Maxwell (UCM) model is a generalisation of the Maxwell material for the case of large deformations using the upper-convected time derivative. The model was proposed by James G. Oldroyd. The concept is named after James Clerk Maxwell.
The model can be written as:

η

D



{\displaystyle \mathbf {T} +\lambda {\stackrel {\nabla }{\mathbf {T} }}=2\eta _{0}\mathbf {D} }

where:





T



{\displaystyle \mathbf {T} }
is the stress tensor;




λ


{\displaystyle \lambda }
is the relaxation time;









T



∇






{\displaystyle {\stackrel {\nabla }{\mathbf {T} }}}
is the upper-convected time derivative of stress tensor:

{\displaystyle \eta _{0}}
is material viscosity at steady simple shear;





D
