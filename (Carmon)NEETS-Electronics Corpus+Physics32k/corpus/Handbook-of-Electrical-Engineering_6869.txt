Noise sources are (1) intrinsic, (2) external, or (3) process induced. Intrinsic noise in conductors comes from
thermal  agitation  of  molecularly  bound  ions  and  electrons,  from  microboundaries  of  impurities  and  grains
with varying potential, and from transistor junction areas that become temporarily depleted of electrons/holes.
External electromagnetic interference sources include airport radar, x-rays, power and telephone lines, com-
munications transmissions, gasoline engines and electric motors, computers and other electronic devices; and
also include lightning, cosmic rays, plasmas (charged particles) in space, and solar/stellar radiation (conductors
act as antennas). Reï¬‚ective objects and other macroboundaries cause multiple paths of signals. Process-induced
errors  include  measurement,  quantization,  truncation,  and  signal  generation  errors.  These  also  corrupt  the
signal with noise power and loss of resolution.
