Hydraulic telemeters are generally used in conjunction with hydraulic sensors and hydraulic displays, such
as  pressure  gauges.  They  are  immune  to  all  electrical  and  optical  interference  and  hence  ﬁnd  application  in
unfavorable electrical and optical environments. A typical hydraulic telemeter is used to measure load lifted
and boom angle on a crane. Here a hydraulic piston is activated by the tension of a lifting rope pushed sidewise
by  the  piston  roller. An  increase  in  tension  produced  by  the  load  tends  to  straighten  the  deﬂected  rope  and
press the piston into its cylinder. The change in pressure is communicated through ﬂuid in a tube to a remote
indicator. The hydraulic telemeter measures the boom angle by simply placing a ﬂuid reservoir on the boom,
which when it is raised provides increased pressure through its tube to a second remote indicator. In this way,
with remote indicators, the operator monitors the crane to prevent overloading and/or overturning.
