The counting stability of the step counter is dependent upon the exponential charging rate of 
capacitor C2. As C2 increases to higher steps, the voltage increments are less and less. If the ratio 
becomes too great, the higher steps become almost indiscernible. For this reason, accuracy decreases as 
the ratio increases. When you desire to count by a large number, 24 for example, a 6-to-1 counter and a 4-
to-1 counter are connected in cascade (series). A more stable method of counting 24 would be to use a 
2:1, 3:1, 4:1 counter connected in cascade. Most step counters operate on a ratio of 5 to 1 or less.
