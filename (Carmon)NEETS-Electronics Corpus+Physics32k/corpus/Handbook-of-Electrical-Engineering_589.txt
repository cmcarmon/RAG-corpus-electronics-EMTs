Compression and Intercept Points
For high-frequency circuits distortion is speciﬁed in terms of compression and intercept points. These quantities
are derived from extrapolated small-signal output power levels. The 1 dB compression point is deﬁned as the
value of the fundamental output power for which the power is 1 dB below the extrapolated small-signal value.
The nth-order intercept point (IPn), n ‡ 2, is the output power at which the extrapolated small-signal powers
of the fundamental and the nth harmonic intersect. Let Pin be an input power that is small enough to ensure
small-signal  operation.  If  P1  is  the  output  power  of  the  fundamental,  and  Pn  the  output  power  of  the  nth
harmonic, then the nth-order intercept point is given by IPn =
