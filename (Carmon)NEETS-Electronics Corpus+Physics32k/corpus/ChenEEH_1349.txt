The type of hardware-based cache coherence approach
used depends heavily on the hardware architecture. For a
shared-bus system, it is relatively easy for each cache controller
to monitor, or ‘‘snoop,’’ on all bus transactions. This is the
popular approach used by so-called snoopy protocols such as
MESI, to be described in Section 2.3.1. Under other, more
general, forms of system architecture, it becomes difﬁcult or
wasteful for all cache controllers to monitor all transactions,
therefore, another protocol must be adopted. Directory-based
protocols that maintain a directory of which parts of main
memory are in which caches eliminate the need for a global
broadcast mechanism; these protocols are therefore better
suited for complex system architectures.
