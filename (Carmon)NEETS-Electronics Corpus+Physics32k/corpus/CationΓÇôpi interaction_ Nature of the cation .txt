From electrostatics (Coulomb's law), smaller and more positively charged cations lead to larger electrostatic attraction. Since cation- π interactions are predicted by electrostatics, it follows that cations with larger charge density interact more strongly with π systems.
The following table shows a series of Gibbs free energy of binding between benzene and several cations in the gas phase. For a singly charged species, the gas-phase interaction energy correlates with the ionic radius,

(non-spherical ionic radii are approximate).

This trend supports the idea that coulombic forces play a central role in interaction strength, since for other types of bonding one would expect the larger and more polarizable ions to have greater binding energies.
