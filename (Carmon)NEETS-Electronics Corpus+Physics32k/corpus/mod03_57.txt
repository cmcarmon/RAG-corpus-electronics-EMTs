It is not practical to install an in-circuit meter in every circuit. However, it is possible to install an in-
circuit meter in each critical or representative circuit to monitor the operation of a piece of electrical
equipment. A mere glance at or scan of the in-circuit meters on a control board is often sufficient to tell if
the equipment is working properly.
