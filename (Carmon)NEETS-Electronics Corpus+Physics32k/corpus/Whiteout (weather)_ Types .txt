There are three different forms of a whiteout:
In blizzard conditions, snow already on the ground can become windblown, reducing visibility to near zero.
In snowfall conditions, the volume of snow falling may obscure objects reducing visibility to near zero. An example of this is during lake-effect snow or mountain-effect snow, where the volume of snow can be many times greater than normal snows or blizzards.
Where ground-level thick fog exists in a snow-covered environment, especially on open areas devoid of features.
