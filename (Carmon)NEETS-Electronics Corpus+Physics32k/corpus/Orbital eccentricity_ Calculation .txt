The eccentricity of an orbit can be calculated from the orbital state vectors as the magnitude of the eccentricity vector:




e
=

|

e

{\displaystyle e=\left|\mathbf {e} \right|}

where:
e is the eccentricity vector.
For elliptical orbits it can also be calculated from the periapsis and apoapsis since rp = a(1 − e) and ra = a(1 + e), where a is the semimajor axis.

where:
ra is the radius at apoapsis (i.e., the farthest distance of the orbit to the center of mass of the system, which is a focus of the ellipse).
rp is the radius at periapsis (the closest distance).
The eccentricity of an elliptical orbit can also be used to obtain the ratio of the periapsis to the apoapsis:

For Earth, orbital eccentricity ≈ 0.0167, apoapsis= aphelion = apogee and periapsis= perihelion = perigee relative to sun.
For Earth's annual orbit path, ra/rp ratio = longest_radius / shortest_radius ≈ 1.034 relative to center point of path.
