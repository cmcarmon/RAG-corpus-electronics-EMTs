The ﬁrst electrical communications network was the telegraph. Here the network consisted of telegraph
operators who transmitted the message eﬃciently using Morse code and routed the message so that it took
the shortest possible path to its destination while taking into account internal network failures (downed lines,
drunken operators). From today’s perspective, the fact that this nineteenth century system handled digital
communications is astounding. Morse code, which assigned a sequence of dots and dashes to each letter of
the alphabet, served as the source coding algorithm. The signal set consisted of a short and a long pulse.
Rather than a matched ﬁlter, the receiver was the operator’s ear, and he wrote the message (translating
from received bits to symbols).
