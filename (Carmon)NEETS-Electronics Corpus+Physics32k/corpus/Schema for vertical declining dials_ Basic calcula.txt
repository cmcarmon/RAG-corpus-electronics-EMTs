There are four basic angles that are needed to construct a vertical declining dial, Waugh described them such:
SD- Sub-style distance - this is the angle on the dial plate between the foot of the style and the vertical noon line.
SH- Sub-style height - this defines the slope of the style. It has no effect on the design of the dial plate.
DL- Difference in longitude- in drawing the dial, DL represents the hour/angle (polar angle)Holwell, John (1712). Clavis Horologiae.   when the shadow passes under the style.
AV- Angle to vertical? -this is used to fix a starting point, in the final stage of laying out equal hours with a protractor. With a calculator this can be easily be derived from the SD and DL, when using compass and ruler it is a construction base line. It never appears on the final dial.
The four basic calculation have a certain symmetry.
tan (SD) = sin (D). cot(φ)
sin (SH) = cos (D). cos(φ)
cot (DL) = cot (D). sin(φ)
cot (AV) = sin (D). tan(φ)
