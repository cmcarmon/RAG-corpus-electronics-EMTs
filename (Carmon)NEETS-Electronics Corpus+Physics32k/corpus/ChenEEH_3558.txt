Until
in our discussion, continuous-time and
discrete-time signals have been considered separately. We did
not consider how the signals arise in practice and where they
are linked in some cases. Now we examine a mechanism—
the sampling process—by which a discrete-time signal
is
obtained from a continuous-time signal.
