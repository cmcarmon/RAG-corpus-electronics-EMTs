A contact between a male part (convex) and a female part (concave) is considered when the radii of curvature are close to one another. There is no tightening and the joint slides with no friction therefore, the contact forces are normal to the tangent of the contact surface.
Moreover, bearing pressure is restricted to the case where the charge can be described by a radial force pointing towards the center of the joint.
