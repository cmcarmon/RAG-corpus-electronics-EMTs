Constant False Alarm Rate
The threshold for detection is usually determined to achieve a
desired false alarm rate. The false alarm rate is quite sensitive
to the threshold level. A constant false alarm rate (CFAR) can
be obtained by adjusting the threshold in accordance with
the measured background. There are different schemes for
obtaining CFAR. The cell-average CFAR uses a tapped delay
line to sample the range cells to either side of the test cell. The
number of taps used in the cell-average CFAR might vary
from 16 to 20. Clutter-map CFAR is to divide the radar’s
space into range and azimuth bins. Over several scans, a
moving average of the clutter residue in each range-azimuth
cell is calculated and is used to determine the threshold level.
In the guard-band CFAR scheme, the interference level is
determined by examining the frequency bands adjacent to
the band containing the signal. The threshold is determined
by this interference level. This type of CFAR is effective against
wideband interference but not effective against clutter. The
limiting CFAR scheme is used when the bandwidth of the
interference is much greater than that of the target echo signal,
such as with wideband noise jamming and with impulse jam-
ming. In this scheme, except the wideband interference, signal
plus high amplitude impulse interface is ampliﬁed and then
pass through a limiter. After limiting, the signal and the inter-
ference have the same amplitude. Because the interference has
much wider spectral bandwidth in the frequency domain, the
power distributed to the signal band is much smaller than the
signal. After passing through a band pass ﬁlter matched to
the signal, the signal amplitude is thus much greater than the
interference amplitude.
