A. Surface micromachining involves the buildup of micro-
mechanical structures on the surface of a substrate by depos-
ition, patterning, and etching processes. The key step is the
etching away of a formerly deposited and patterned sacriﬁcial
layer to free the mechanism. This process was ﬁrst demon-
strated almost 40 years ago, when a MOSFET with a cantilever
mechanical gate was produced (Nathanson et al. 1967). The
most common sacriﬁcial material now is silicon dioxide, which
is conveniently dissolved from under a moveable part using
hydroﬂuoric acid. Surface micromachining has been used to
produce an amazing variety of micromechanical devices, some
of which are now in large-scale production. Microaccelerom-
eters and MEMS angle rate sensors are examples.
