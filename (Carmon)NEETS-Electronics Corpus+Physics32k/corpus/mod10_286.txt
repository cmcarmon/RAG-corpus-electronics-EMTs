c. The F layer exists from about 90 to 240 miles. During the daylight hours, the F layer separates 
into two layers, the F1 and F2 layers. The ionization level in these layers is quite high and varies 
widely during the day. At noon, this portion of the atmosphere is closest to the sun and the degree 
of ionization is maximum. Since the atmosphere is rarefied at these heights, recombination occurs 
slowly after sunset. Therefore, a fairly constant ionized layer is always present. The F layers are 
responsible for high-frequency, long distance transmission.
