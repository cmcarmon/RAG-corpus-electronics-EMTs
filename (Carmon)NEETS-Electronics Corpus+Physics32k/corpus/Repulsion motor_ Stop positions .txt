Brush axis parallel to field
If the brush axis is along the direction of the magnetic field, the armature behaves like an electromagnet and a N-pole is formed directly below the N-pole of the stator and a S-pole is formed directly above the S-pole of the stator. The net torque in this condition is zero. Both the N-poles repel each other a nd both the S-poles repel each other. The two repulsion forces are in direct opposition to each other and hence no torque will be developed. This is very fast process in this repulsion motor.
Brush axis at right angles to field
If the brushes are shifted through 90 degrees, so that the magnetic axis is perpendicular to the brush axis, the coils undergoing short circuit change. Apart from the coils undergoing short circuit, the voltage induced in the other coils between the brush terminals is neutralized and the net voltage is zero. Since there is no induced emf, there is no current in the circuit and the net torque developed is, again, zero.
