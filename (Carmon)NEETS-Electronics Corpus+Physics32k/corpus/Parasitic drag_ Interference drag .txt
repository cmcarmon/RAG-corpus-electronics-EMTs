Interference drag results when airflow around one part of an object (such as a fuselage) must occupy the same space as the airflow around another part (such as a wing). The two competing airflows must speed up in order to pass through the restricted area; this speeding-up process requires extra energy and creates turbulence, resulting in a measurable increase in the form drag. This velocity increase is present at all airspeeds, but becomes even more important in the transonic range when the resulting velocity becomes sonic, producing shock waves.
Interference drag plays a role throughout the entire aircraft (e.g., nacelles, pylons, empennage) and its detrimental effect is always kept in mind by designers. Ideally, the pressure distributions on the intersecting bodies should complement each otherâ€™s pressure distribution. If one body locally displays a negative pressure coefficient, the intersecting body should have a positive pressure coefficient. In reality, however, this is not always possible. Particular geometric characteristics on aircraft often show how designers have dealt with the issue of interference drag. A prime example is the wing-body fairing, which smooths the sharp angle at the intersection of the wing and the fuselage. Another example is the junction between the horizontal and vertical tailplane in a T-tail. Often, an additional fairing (acorn) is positioned to reduce the added supervelocities. The position of the nacelle with respect to the wing is a third example of how interference-drag considerations dominate this geometric feature. Interference drag is considered when deciding the lateral and longitudinal placement of nacelles on the wing. If there is little vertical space available between the wing and the nacelle (due to need for ground clearance) the nacelle is usually positioned much more in front of the wing. The NACA area rule is one approach to reducing transonic interference drag.
