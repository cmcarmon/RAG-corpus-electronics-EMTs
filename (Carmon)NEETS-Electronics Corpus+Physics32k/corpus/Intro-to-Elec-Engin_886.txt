of power). The current source is commonly a coil of N turns, carrying a current I known as the
exciting current; the mmf is then said to be NI At.
Figure 11.2.1(a) shows, schematically, a simple magnetic circuit with an mmf ᑣ (= N I )
and magnetic ﬂux φ. Note that the right-hand rule gives the direction of ﬂux for the chosen
direction of current. The concept of a magnetic circuit is useful in estimating the mmf (excitation
ampere-turns) needed for simple electromagnetic structures, or in ﬁnding approximate ﬂux and
ﬂux densities produced by coils wound on ferromagnetic cores. Magnetic circuit analysis follows
the procedures that are used for simple dc electric circuit analysis.
