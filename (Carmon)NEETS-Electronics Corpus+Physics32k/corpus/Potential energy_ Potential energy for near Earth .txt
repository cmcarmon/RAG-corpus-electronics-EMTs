The following function is called the potential energy of a near earth gravity field:




U
(

r

)
=
m
g

h
(

r

)
,


{\displaystyle U(\mathbf {r} )=mg\,h(\mathbf {r} ),}

where m is in kg, g is 9.81 for earth and h is in metres.
In classical physics, gravity exerts a constant downward force F=(0, 0, Fz) on the center of mass of a body moving near the surface of the Earth. The work of gravity on a body moving along a trajectory r(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t)), such as the track of a roller coaster is calculated using its velocity, v=(vx, vy, vz), to obtain

{\displaystyle W=\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}{\boldsymbol {F}}\cdot {\boldsymbol {v}}\mathrm {d} t=\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}F_{z}v_{z}\mathrm {d} t=F_{z}\Delta z.}

where the integral of the vertical component of velocity is the vertical distance. Notice that the work of gravity depends only on the vertical movement of the curve r(t).
