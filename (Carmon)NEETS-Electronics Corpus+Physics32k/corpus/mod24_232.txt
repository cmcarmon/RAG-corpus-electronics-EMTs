Chapter 2 classified optical fibers as either single mode or multimode fibers. Fibers are classified
according to the number of modes that they can propagate. Single mode fibers can propagate only the
fundamental mode. Multimode fibers can propagate hundreds of modes. However, the classification of an
optical fiber depends on more than the number of modes that a fiber can propagate.
