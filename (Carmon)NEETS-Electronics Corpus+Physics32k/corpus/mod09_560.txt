The ability of a smaller value capacitor to quickly discharge to a lower voltage is an advantage when 
the amplitude of the input wave shape is suddenly reduced. However, for normal clamper operation, quick 
discharge time is a disadvantage. This is because one objective of clamping is to keep the output wave 
shape the same as the input wave shape. If the small capacitor allows a relatively large amount of the 
voltage to discharge with each cycle, then distortion occurs in the output wave shape. A larger portion of 
the wave shape then appears on the wrong side of the reference line.
