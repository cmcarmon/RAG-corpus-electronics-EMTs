By varying the resistance of the potentiometer (R1), you control the timing 
cycle, but because this pot is smaller than the pot used in the light chaser 
 circuits, you can’t vary the timing quite as much. The full duration of the 
timing cycle (that is, the time it takes to complete one up‐and‐down pulse on 
pin 3 of the 555 timer IC) is designed to range from about 3 seconds to about 
10 seconds.
