Part of the correct use of an ammeter is the proper use of the range selection switch. If the current to
be measured is larger than the scale of the meter selected, the meter movement will have excessive
current and will be damaged. Therefore, it is important to always start with the highest range when you
use an ammeter. If the current can be measured on several ranges, use the range that results in a reading
near the middle of the scale. Figure 1-24 illustrates these points.
