systems. For linear time-invariant control systems the roots of the characteristic equation determine the stability
of the system. For a stable continuous-data system the roots must all lie in the left half of the s plane. For a
digital control system to be stable, the roots of the characteristic equation must all lie inside the unit circle *z*
= 1 in the z plane. Thus, in the s plane, the imaginary axis is the stability boundary, whereas in the z plane the
stability boundary is the unit circle. The location of the characteristic equation roots with respect to the stability
boundary also determine the relative stability, i.e., the degree of stability, of the system.
