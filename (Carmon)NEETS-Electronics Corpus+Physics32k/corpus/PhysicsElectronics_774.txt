Example: Suppose that the 2-bit binary number AB must be transmitted between
devices in a noisy environment. To reduce undetected errors introduced by the
transmission, an extra bit P is often included to add redundancy to the informa-
tion. Assume that P is set true or false as needed to make an odd number of
true bits in the resulting 3-bit number ABP . When the number is received, logic
circuits are required to generate an error signal E whenever the odd number of
bits condition is not met.
