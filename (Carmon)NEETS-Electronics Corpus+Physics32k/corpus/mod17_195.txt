Figure 2-9 shows a block diagram with waveforms of a typical AM superheterodyne receiver
developed to overcome the disadvantages of earlier type receivers. Letâ€™s assume you are tuning the
receiver. When doing this you are actually changing the frequency to which the rf amplifier is tuned. The
rf carrier comes in from the antenna and is applied to the rf amplifier. The output of the amplifier is an
amplified carrier and is sent to the mixer. The mixer also receives an input from the local oscillator. These
two signals are beat together to obtain the IF through the process of heterodyning. (Heterodyning will be
further discussed later in this chapter and was covered in NEETS, Module 12, Modulation Principles.) At
this time you should note the dotted lines connecting the local oscillator, rf amplifier, and the mixer. This
is used on block diagrams and schematics to indicate GANGED TUNING. Ganged tuning is the process
used to tune two or more circuits with a single control. In our example, when you change the frequency of
the receiver all three stages change by the same amount. There is a fixed difference in frequency between
the local oscillator and the rf amplifier at all times. This difference in frequency is the IF. This fixed
difference and ganged tuning ensures a constant IF over the frequency range of the receiver.
