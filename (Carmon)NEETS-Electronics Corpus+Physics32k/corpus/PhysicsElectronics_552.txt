The MOSFET comes in four basic types, N-channel, P-channel, depletion and enhance-
ment. The conﬁguration of an N-channel, depletion MOSFET is shown in ﬁgure 5.19a. Its
operation is similar to the N-channel JFET discussed previously: a negative voltage placed
on the gate generates a charge depleted region in the N-type material next to the gate,
thereby reducing the area of the conduction channel between the drain and source. How-
ever, the mechanism by which the depletion region is formed is diﬀerent from the JFET. As
the gate is made negative with respect to the source, more positive carriers from the P-type
material are drawn into the N-channel, where they combine with and eliminate the free
negative charges. This action enlarges the depletion region towards the gate, reducing the
area of the N-channel and thereby lowering the conductivity between the drain and source.
For negative applied gate-source voltages the observed eﬀect is much like a JFET, and gm
is also about the same size.
