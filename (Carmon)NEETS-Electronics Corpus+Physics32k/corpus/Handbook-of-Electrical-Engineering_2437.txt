as shown in Fig. 24.4(b). The gate-to-channel bias voltage at the source end is still 
 = –1 V, so the depletion region will be wider at the drain end
bias voltage at the drain end is 
of the channel than at the source end. The channel will thus be narrower at the drain end than at the source
 and, correspondingly, an increase in the
end, and this will result in a decrease in the channel conductance 
 curve that corresponds to the channel conductance will
channel resistance 
be smaller at
