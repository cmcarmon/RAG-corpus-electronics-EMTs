  6.  Maximum power dissipation? Use maximum 
voltage and collector current requirements to 
 determine maximum power requirements  
(P 5 IE). The transistor is a major factor in 
 determining power dissipation in the following 
types of circuits:
	● Input stages, AF, or RF (50 to 200 mW)
	● IF stages and driver stages (200 mW to 1 W)
	● High-power output stages (1 W and higher)
