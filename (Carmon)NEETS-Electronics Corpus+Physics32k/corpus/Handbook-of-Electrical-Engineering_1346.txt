The ﬁnal results of the U.S. DoD standard competition are summarized in Table 15.2 for “quiet” and “ofﬁce”
environments. In the table, the column labeled “FOM” is the overall Figure of Merit used by the DoD Digital
complexity  and
Voice  Processing  Consortium  in  selecting  the  coder.  The  FOM  is  a  unitless  combination  of 
performance components, and is measured with respect to FS-1016. The complexity of a coder is a weighted
combination of memory and processing power required. The performance of a coder is a weighted combination
of four factors: quality (Q—measured via MOS), intelligibility (I—measured via DRT), speaker recognition (R),
and  communicability  (C).  Recognizability  and  communicability  for  each  coder  were  measured  by  tests
