Figure 4-28 shows an RC capacitor-input filter and associated waveforms. Both half-wave and full-
wave rectifiers are used to provide the inputs. The waveform shown in view A of the figure represent the 
unfiltered output from a typical rectifier circuit. Note that the dashed lines in view A indicate the average 
value of output voltage (E avg) for the half-wave rectifier. The average output voltage (E avg) is less than 
half (approximately 0.318) the amplitude of the voltage peaks. The average value of output voltage (Eavg) 
for the full-wave rectifier is greater than half (approximately 0.637), but is still much less than, the peak 
amplitude of the rectifier-output waveform. With no filter circuit connected across the output of the 
rectifier circuit (unfiltered), the waveform has a large value of pulsating component (ripple) as compared 
to the average (or dc) component.
