Pole changing motors are normally used in applications where two speed controls are necessary. Some typical applications are:
Pumps, wherein two speeds can be used to control the output flow
Fans, to get variable air flow output
Crushers
Milling applications
Cranes, where two speeds can be used in hoisting applications: one speed for material movement and the other for positioning the material held in the hoist
