Similar procedures can be extended to a half-wave slot
antenna or, in general, to a rectangular slot antenna of any
arbitrary length. This will allow derivation of the far Ô¨Åelds, as
well as radiation/impedance parameters of a long slot antenna,
by relating to those of the complementary dipole structures in
Section 6.2.1 under Dipole Antenna of Arbitrary Length.
