An important requirement of most amplifiers is that 
the  output  signal  should  be  a  faithful  copy  of  the 
input  signal,  albeit  somewhat  larger  in  amplitude. 
Other  types  of  amplifier  are  non-linear,  in  which 
case  their  input  and  output  waveforms  will  not 
necessarily  be  similar.  In  practice,  the  degree  of 
linearity provided by an amplifier can be affected 
by a number of factors including the amount of bias 
applied  (see  later)  and  the  amplitude  of  the  input 
signal.  
 
It is also worth noting that a linear amplifier will 
become  non-linear  when  the  applied  input  signal 
exceeds  a  threshold  value.  Beyond  this  value  the 
amplifier  is  said  to  be  overdriven  and  the  output 
will  become  increasingly  distorted  if  the  input 
signal is further increased.  
  Amplifiers  are  usually  designed  to  be  operated 
with a particular value of bias supplied to the active 
devices  (i.e.  transistors).  For  linear  operation,  the
