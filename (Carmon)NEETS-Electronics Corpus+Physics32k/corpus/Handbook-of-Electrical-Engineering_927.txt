V is the velocity at which the oxide is moving and P is the hydrostatic pressure. The second equation results
form the incompressibility of the oxide. The varying pressure  P within the oxide leads to mechanical stress,
and the oxidant diffusion constant D0 and the oxide growth rate constant ks are both dependent on this stress.
The oxidant ﬂow and the oxide ﬂow are therefore coupled because the oxide ﬂow depends on the rate at which
oxide is generated at the interface and the rate at which the new oxide is generated depends on the availability
of oxidant, which is controlled by the mechanical stress.
