Signal isolation must be used to pass the signal from the source to the measuring device without a physical connection: it is often used to isolate possible sources of signal perturbations. Also notable is that it is important to isolate the potentially expensive equipment used to process the signal after conditioning from the sensor.
Magnetic or optic isolation can be used. Magnetic isolation transforms the signal from voltage to a magnetic field so the signal can be transmitted without physical connection (for example, using a transformer). Optic isolation modulates an electronic signal and into a signal coded by light transmission (optical encoding), which is then used for input for the next stage of processing.
