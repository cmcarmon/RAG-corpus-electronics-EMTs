Some of these semiconductors, such as GaAs and AlGaAs
or GaN and AlGaN, can be grown as ﬁlms on top of each
other to form heterostructures. Hence, very many different
material combinations with different properties are available
to a semiconductor device designer. As can be seen from Figure
6.2, each silicon atom is located at the center of the tetrahedron
formed by four other silicon atoms. In Si, such an arrangement
is formed by two interpenetrating face-centered cubic sublat-
tices of silicon atoms, shifted with respect to each other by
one fourth of the body diagonal. A diamond crystal (one of
the crystalline modiﬁcations of carbon) has the same crystal
structure, which is traditionally called the diamond crystal
structure (see Figure 6.4). Another important semicon-
ductor—germanium (Ge)—also has
the diamond crystal
structure.
