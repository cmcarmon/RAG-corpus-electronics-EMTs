Carbon resistors are the most common resistors found because they are easy to manufacturer,
inexpensive, and have a tolerance that is adequate for most electrical and electronic applications. Their
prime disadvantage is that they have a tendency to change value as they age. One other disadvantage of
carbon resistors is their limited power handling capacity.
