Some of the energy generated by the radar transmitter is picked up by the echo box by means of the 
directional coupler. This energy causes oscillations (known as RINGING) within the echo box that persist 
for some time after the end of the radar pulse, much in the fashion of an echo that persists in a large room 
after a loud noise. As this echo dies down, a part of it is fed back into the radar receiving system, again by 
means of the directional coupler. The ringing causes a saturating signal to appear on the radar indicator 
(figure 4-6). The longer this ringing extends, the better the performance of the radar.
