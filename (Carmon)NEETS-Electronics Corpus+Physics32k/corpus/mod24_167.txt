Attenuation in an optical fiber is caused by absorption, scattering, and bending losses. Attenuation
is the loss of optical power as light travels along the fiber. Signal attenuation is defined as the ratio of
optical input power (Pi) to the optical output power (Po). Optical input power is the power injected into
the fiber from an optical source. Optical output power is the power received at the fiber end or optical
detector. The following equation defines signal attenuation as a unit of length:
