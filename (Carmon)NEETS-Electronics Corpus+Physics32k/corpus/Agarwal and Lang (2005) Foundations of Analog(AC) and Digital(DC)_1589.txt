Digital circuits form the basis of a large number of battery-powered appliances
used in our day to day life, including cell phones, beepers, digital watches, cal-
culators, and laptop computers. A battery of a given weight and size stores a
fixed amount of energy. The amount of time that the battery will last before
requiring a replacement or a recharge depends on the amount of energy con-
sumed by the device. Similarly, the heat generated by a device depends on
its energy consumption rate, or power dissipation. Thus, both the amount of
energy consumed by a device and the rate of energy consumption are critical
issues in the design of circuits.
