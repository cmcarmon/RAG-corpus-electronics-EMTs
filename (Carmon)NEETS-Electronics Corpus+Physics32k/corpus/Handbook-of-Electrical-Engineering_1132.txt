Analog ﬁlters and hence IIR digital ﬁlters are typically speciﬁed in a slightly different fashion than FIR ﬁlters.
Figure 14.11 illustrates how analog and IIR digital ﬁlters are usually speciﬁed. Notice by comparison to Fig. 14.10
that  the  passband  ripple  in  this  case  never  goes  above  unity,  whereas  in  the  FIR  case  the  passband  ripple  is
speciﬁed about unity.
