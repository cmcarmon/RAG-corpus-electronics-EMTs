(b) If, in addition to the constant potential VB, an alternating or time-varying potential
2 VS sin Ï‰t is impressed across the circuit, discuss the dynamic (ac)
characteristics of the diode in terms of (i) small-signal current and voltage waveforms,
and (ii) large-signal current and voltage waveforms.
