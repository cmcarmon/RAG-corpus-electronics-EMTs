■● Race: Detrimental comments or actions  regarding 
race toward an individual or a group is  considered 
harassment. Employers or  coworkers may not treat 
any employee  differently  because of race and must 
refrain from  making either negative or positive 
comments, using  stereotyped  language, or mak-
ing jokes about race and  ethnicity, as they may 
be viewed as  offensive and therefore harassing. 
Other examples or  prohibited comments and ac-
tions include those  relating to appearance, educa-
tion or intelligence,  inferiority of ability, or race 
comparisons.
