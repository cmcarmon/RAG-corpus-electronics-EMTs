Bit-string physics is a body of theory which supposes that reality can be represented by a process of operations on finite strings of dichotomous symbols, or bits (1's and 0's). Bit-string physics has developed from Frederick Parker-Rhodes' 1964 discovery of the combinatorial hierarchy: four numbers produced from a purely mathematical recursive algorithm that correspond to the relative strengths of the four forces. These strengths are characterized by the strong, weak, electromagnetic (fine-structure constant), and gravitational coupling constants. Other leading contributors in the field include H. Pierre Noyes, Ted Bastin, Clive W. Kilmister, John Amson, Mike Manthey, and David McGoveran.
In a 2001 paper by Noyes, evidence was presented for predictions made by the theory that were later confirmed.
