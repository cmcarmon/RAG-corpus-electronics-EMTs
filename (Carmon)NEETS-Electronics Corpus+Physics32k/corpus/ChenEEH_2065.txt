System behavioral properties can be divided into two major
categories: safety properties and liveness properties (Manna
and Pnueli, 1992). Widely accepted formal deÔ¨Ånitions of safety
and liveness properties were given in (Alpern and Schneider,
1985). A safety property, which is different from the concept
safeness in Petri net literature (Murata, 1999) needs to hold in
every state and in every state sequence. The canonical form of a
safety property is characterized by a temporal formula tuw. A
liveness property, which is different from the concept transi-
tion liveness in Petri net literature (Murata, 1989), needs to
hold in some future state in every state sequence. The canon-
ical form of a liveness property is characterized by a temporal
formula }w.
