A wide variety of MEMS switch designs for high frequencies
has been prototyped. In general, they have very low insertion
losses (when closed) and excellent isolation (when open).
Raytheon has developed a capacitively coupled switch, as
shown in Figure 6.16. Rockwell has produced MEMS metal-
to-metal switches as well as interdigitated capacitors for use in
microwave circuits. The University of Michigan has the highest
frequency MEMS resonators. A device based on a beam with
both ends free (similar to a xylophone key) has exhibited
resonance at 92 MHz. Its vibratory displacement is on the
order of a nanometer. Other designs based on the expansion
and contraction of disc-shaped structures were developed at
the University of Michigan for operation at frequencies ap-
proaching 1 GHz. Few microwave MEMS devices are on the
market now, but this situation will change markedly in the
coming years because of the wireless revolution.
