Consider the two-resistor current divider shown in Figure 2.37. It has
three elements, or branches, and hence six unknown branch variables. To find
these branch variables we again assemble the element laws and the appropriate
applications of KCL and KVL, and then simultaneously solve the resulting
equations. First, the three element laws are
i0 = âˆ’I
v1 = R1i1
v2 = R2i2.
