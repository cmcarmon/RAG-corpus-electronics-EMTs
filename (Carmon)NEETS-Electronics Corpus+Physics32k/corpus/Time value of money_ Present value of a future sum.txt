The present value formula is the core formula for the time value of money; each of the other formulae is derived from this formula. For example, the annuity formula is the sum of a series of present value calculations.
The present value (PV) formula has four variables, each of which can be solved for:




P
V

=




F
V


(
1
+
i

)

n







{\displaystyle PV\ =\ {\frac {FV}{(1+i)^{n}}}}

The cumulative present value of future cash flows can be calculated by summing the contributions of FVt, the value of cash flow at time t

)

t







{\displaystyle PV\ =\ \sum _{t=1}^{n}{\frac {FV_{t}}{(1+i)^{t}}}}

Note that this series can be summed for a given value of n, or when n is ∞. This is a very general formula, which leads to several important special cases given below.
