It has been shown that signal ordering can effectively reduce
the cross talk noise on interconnects. In other words, arranging
signals in an order that does not let a wire Ô¨Åght against its
neighbor, making a transition in the same direction, can
reduce the cross talk noise. For example, two interconnect
layout design methodologies
for minimizing the cross-
coupling capacitance effect in the design of a full-custom
data path have been proposed by Yim and Kyung (1999).
These are the control-signal ordering scheme and the track
assignment algorithm. Figure 8.10 shows how the control
signal for a multiplexer can be ordered to decrease the cross
talk effect.
