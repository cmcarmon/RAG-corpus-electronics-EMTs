Once current is forced through an insulating material, breakdown of that material’s molec-
ular structure has occurred. After breakdown, the material may or may not behave as an in-
sulator any more, the molecular structure having been altered by the breach. There is usually
a localized ”puncture” of the insulating medium where the electrons ﬂowed during breakdown.
Thickness of an insulating material plays a role in determining its breakdown voltage,
otherwise known as dielectric strength. Speciﬁc dielectric strength is sometimes listed in terms
of volts per mil (1/1000 of an inch), or kilovolts per inch (the two units are equivalent), but in
practice it has been found that the relationship between breakdown voltage and thickness is
not exactly linear. An insulator three times as thick has a dielectric strength slightly less than
3 times as much. However, for rough estimation use, volt-per-thickness ratings are ﬁne.
