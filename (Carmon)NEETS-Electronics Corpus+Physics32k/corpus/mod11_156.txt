When no magnetic field exists, heating the cathode results in a uniform and direct movement of the 
field from the cathode to the plate, as illustrated in figure 2-21B. However, as the magnetic field 
surrounding the tube is increased, a single electron is affected, as shown in figure 2-22. In figure 2-22, 
view (A), the magnetic field has been increased to a point where the electron proceeds to the plate in a 
curve rather than a direct path.
