Construction of a JFET begins with a substrate, 
or base, of lightly doped semiconductor material. 
The substrate can be either P- or N-type mate-
rial. The P–N junction in the substrate is made using 
both the growth and diffusion methods (see Chap-
ter 29). The shape of the P–N junction is important. 
Figure 32-1 shows a cross section of the embedded 
region within the substrate. The U-shaped region is 
called the  channel and is flush with the upper surface 
of the substrate. When the channel is made of N-type 
 material in a P-type substrate, an N-channel	JFET is 
formed. When the channel is made of P-type material 
in an N-type substrate, a P-channel	JFET is formed.
