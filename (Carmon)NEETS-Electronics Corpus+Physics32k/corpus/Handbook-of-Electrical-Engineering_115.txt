The maximum voltage induced in a conductor moving in a magnetic ﬁeld is proportional to the number of
magnetic lines of force cut by that conductor. When a conductor moves parallel to the lines of force, it cuts no
lines of force; therefore, no current is generated in the conductor. A conductor that moves at right angles to
the lines of force cuts the maximum number of lines per inch per second, therefore creating a maximum voltage.
The right-hand rule determines direction of the induced electromotive force (emf). The emf is in the direction
in which the axis of a right-hand screw, when turned with the velocity vector, moves through the smallest angle
toward the ﬂux density vector.
