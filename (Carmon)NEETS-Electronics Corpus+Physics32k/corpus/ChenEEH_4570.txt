inverse method or model-following method (Gao and Antsak-
lis, 1991, 1992), eigenstructure assignment (Jiang, 1994), LQC
(Sauter et al., 1998), additive compensation for sensor and
actuator failures (Noura et al., 2000; Theilliol et al., 1998),
reconﬁguration control with parameter identiﬁcation (Rauch,
1995; Bodson and Grosz-Kiewicz, 1997), state-space pole
placement (Jiang and Zhao, 1998, 1999); and (interactive)
multiple model method (IMM) (Maybeck and Stevens, 1991;
Zhang and Li, 1998; Zhang and Jiang, 1999) as shown in Figure
8.2. However, this is rarely the case in practice since all the
systems are inherently nonlinear, and the system dynamics
under failure situations are more likely to be nonlinear and
time varying. The failure situations can be further categorized
into anticipated and unanticipated faults where the anticipated
ones are referred to as the known faults based on the prior
knowledge of the system or possibly the history of system
behavior, and the unanticipated ones are the unexpected fail-
ure situations, which have to be identiﬁed online. In general,
the recognition and accommodation of the anticipated failures
are considered relatively easier to solve because of the avail-
ability of the prior information and sufﬁcient time for the
development of solutions (i.e., off-line). The details of the
systematic procedure of the proper failure isolation and ac-
commodation for anticipated faults, such as the generation of
residuals, fault signature identiﬁcation, and the selection logic
