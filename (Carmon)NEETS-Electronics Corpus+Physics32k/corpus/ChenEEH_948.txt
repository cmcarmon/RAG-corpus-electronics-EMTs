where L1 is a lower triangular matrix. The Cholesky decom-
position is computationally more efÔ¨Åcient than a general LU
decomposition in that the Cholesky decomposition requires
about half of the computation time of a general LU decom-
position. Finally, the Cholesky decomposition has useful prop-
erties related to issues of numerical stability and accuracy. (An
in-depth treatment of this subject is discussed in Golub and
Loan [1996] and Forsythe and Moler [1967].)
