In Newton's theory of gravitation, Poisson's equation reads




Δ
U
=

G
ρ



{\displaystyle \Delta U=4\pi G\rho \,}

where



U


{\displaystyle U}
is the gravitational potential,



G


{\displaystyle G}
is the gravitational constant and



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
is the mass density. The weak equivalence principle motivates a geometric version of the equation of motion for a point particle in the potential

where

{\displaystyle m_{t}}
is the inertial mass and

{\displaystyle m_{g}}
the gravitational mass. Since, according to the weak equivalence principle
