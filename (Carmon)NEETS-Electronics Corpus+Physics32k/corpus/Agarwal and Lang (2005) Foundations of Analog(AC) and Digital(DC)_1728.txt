Since ω◦, ωd, and α are directly related to the roots of the characteristic
equation, s1 and s2 (see Equations 12.60, 12.61, and 12.62), it should also be
clear at this point why s1 and s2 are called the natural frequencies of the system.
Equation 12.60 indicates that α, ωd, and ω◦ respectively, form the two sides
and hypotenuse of a right triangle. In fact, this is part of a more comprehensive
picture of the location in the complex plane of the roots of the characteristic
equation. These locations, given by Equations 12.61 and 12.62, are shown in
Figure 12.17. Note that as R varies so do α and ωd; ω◦, however, remains
constant so that s1 and s2 remain the constant distance ω◦ from the complex-
plane origin for the case of under-damped dynamics.
