, and other computer-dependent technologies are fully utilized, elec-
tronic systems may constitute more than 20% of the value of a car. Much of the added computing power will
be used for new technology for smart cars and smart roads, or ITS (intelligent transportation systems). The
term refers to a varied assortment of electronics that provide real-time information on accidents, congestion,
routing, and roadside services to drivers and trafﬁc controllers. ITS encompass devices that would make vehicles
more autonomous: collision-avoidance systems and lane-tracking technology that alert drivers to impending
disaster or allow a car to drive itself. ITS also includes interfaces between personal trafﬁc and mass transpor-
tation,  particularly  when  rail  trafﬁc  mixes  with  cars  and  at  rail  crossings,  whether  or  not  such  crossings  are
protected by gates. Railroads and mass transit vehicles have many of the same internal subsystems as cars do,
and also additional subsystems, for which cars may soon have analogous functions. The electrical and electronic
systems and controls account for 15 to 30% of the cost of the vehicle.
