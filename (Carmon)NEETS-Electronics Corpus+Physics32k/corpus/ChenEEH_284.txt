Many analog circuits such as ﬁlters, sample-and-hold amp-
liﬁers, and switched-capacitor networks employ a resistor or a
conductance that is bandwidth-limited by a capacitance or
inductance. Just as the reactance of the inductor or capacitor
limits the bandwidth of the input signal, it also affects the
noise bandwidth. In the case of an RC circuit, the rms noise
voltage is expressed as:
