Fields have two measures: a ﬁeld force and a ﬁeld ﬂux. The ﬁeld force is the amount of
”push” that a ﬁeld exerts over a certain distance. The ﬁeld ﬂux is the total quantity, or effect,
of the ﬁeld through space. Field force and ﬂux are roughly analogous to voltage (”push”) and
current (ﬂow) through a conductor, respectively, although ﬁeld ﬂux can exist in totally empty
space (without the motion of particles such as electrons) whereas current can only take place
where there are free electrons to move. Field ﬂux can be opposed in space, just as the ﬂow
of electrons can be opposed by resistance. The amount of ﬁeld ﬂux that will develop in space
is proportional to the amount of ﬁeld force applied, divided by the amount of opposition to
ﬂux. Just as the type of conducting material dictates that conductor’s speciﬁc resistance to
electric current, the type of insulating material separating two conductors dictates the speciﬁc
opposition to ﬁeld ﬂux.
