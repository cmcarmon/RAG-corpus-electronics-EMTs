Free carrier concentration is the concentration of free carriers in a doped semiconductor. It is similar to the carrier concentration in a metal and for the purposes of calculating currents or drift velocities can be used in the same way. Free carriers are electrons (or holes) which have been introduced directly into the conduction band (or valence band) by doping and are not promoted thermally. For this reason electrons (holes) will not act as double carriers by leaving behind holes (electrons) in the other band. In other words, charge carriers are particles/electrons that are free to move (carry the charge). They get charged at the battery/cell, and then flow throughout the circuit, giving energy to any components in the way, then when out of charge and towards the end of the circuit, they get re-charged by the battery/cell.
