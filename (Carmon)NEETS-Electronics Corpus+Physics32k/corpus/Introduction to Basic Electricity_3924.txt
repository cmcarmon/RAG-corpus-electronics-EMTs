For amplifiers greater than 10 watts, it is diffi-
cult and expensive to match NPN and PNP transis-
tors to ensure that they have the same characteristics. 
 FigureÂ 38-10 shows a circuit that uses two NPN tran-
sistors for the output-power transistors. The power 
transistors are driven by lower-power NPN and PNP 
transistors, and the upper set of transistors is con-
nected in a Darlington configuration. The lower set of 
transistors uses a PNP transistor and an NPN transis-
tor. Operating as a single unit, they respond like a PNP 
transistor. This type of amplifier is called a quasi-
complementary amplifier. It operates like a com-
plementary amplifier but does not require high-power 
complementary output transistors.
