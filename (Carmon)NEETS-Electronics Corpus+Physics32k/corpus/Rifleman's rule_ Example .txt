Assume a rifle is being fired that shoots with the bullet drop table given in Table 1. This means that the rifle sight setting for any range from 0 to 500 meters is available. The sight adjustment procedure can be followed step-by-step.
1. Determine the slant range to the target.
Assume that a range finder is available that determines that the target is exactly 300 meters distance.
2. Determine the elevation angle of the target.
Assume that an angle measurement tool is used that measures the target to be at an angle of

∘




{\displaystyle 20^{\circ }}
with respect to horizontal.
3. Apply the rifleman's rule to determine the equivalent horizontal range.

{\displaystyle R_{H}=300{\mbox{ meters}}\cos(20^{\circ })=282{\mbox{ meters}}}

4. Use the bullet drop table to determine the bullet drop over that equivalent horizontal range.
Linear interpolation can be used to estimate the bullet drop as follows:

{\displaystyle {\mbox{bullet drop}}={\frac {-11.0\cdot (282-200)+-2.9\cdot (300-282)}{300-200}}=-9.5{\mbox{ cm}}}

5. Compute the bore angle correction that is to be applied to the sight.

6. Adjust the bore angle by the angle correction.
The gun sight is adjusted up by 0.94 mil or 3.2' in order to compensate for the bullet drop. The gunsights are usually adjustable in unit of ​1⁄2 minutes, ​1⁄4 minutes of angle or 0.1 milliradians.
