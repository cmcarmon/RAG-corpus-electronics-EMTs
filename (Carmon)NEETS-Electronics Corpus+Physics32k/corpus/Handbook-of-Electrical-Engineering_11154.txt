In addition to problems due to hydrostatic pressure differ-
ences between the chamber and the dome, catheters introduce
pressure  errors  as  a  result  of  the  dynamic  properties  of  the
catheter, ﬂuid, dome, and diaphragm. These properties as well
as air bubbles in the catheter, or obstructions due to clotted
blood or other materials, introduce resonances and damping.
These  problems  can  be  minimized  by  utilizing  miniature
pressure  transducers  fabricated  using  microelectronic  semi-
conductor technology that are located at the tip of a catheter
rather than at the end that is external to the body. A general
arrangement for such a pressure transducer is shown in Fig. 114.2. As with the disposable sensors, strain gauges
are  integrated  into  the  diaphragm  of  the  transducer  such  that  they  detect  very  small  deﬂections  of  this  dia-
phragm. Because of the small size, small diaphragm displacement, and lack of a catheter with a ﬂuid column,
these sensors have a much broader frequency response, give a clearer signal, and do not have any hydrostatic
pressure error.
