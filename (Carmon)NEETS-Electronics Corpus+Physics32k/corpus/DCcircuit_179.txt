If we try to apply Ohm’s Law to ﬁnd the resistance of this lamp circuit with the voltage
and current values plotted above, we arrive at several different values. We could say that the
resistance here is nonlinear, increasing with increasing current and voltage. The nonlinearity
is caused by the effects of high temperature on the metal wire of the lamp ﬁlament.
