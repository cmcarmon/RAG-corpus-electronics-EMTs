Total losses for transformer performance are made up of no-
load losses and load losses. No-load losses are primarily
hysteresis and eddy-current loss in the core. This loss is inde-
pendent of load and exists whenever the transformer is con-
nected to the system. The no-load loss is a function of the
voltage of the system. The core’s eddy-current loss is propor-
tional to the square of the system frequency, and the hysteresis
loss is proportional to the frequency. Load losses consist of I 2R
loss in the windings, stray losses in the windings, and struc-
tural clamps and ﬁttings. These losses are caused by the load
current. On large well-designed transformers, the total rated
losses are on the order of 0.3 to 0.5% of the rated kVA of the
transformer. The cost per kilovoltampere is different for load
factors
and no-load losses and depends on a number of
