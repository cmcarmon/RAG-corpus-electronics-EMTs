In the cases when the above-mentioned relaying schemes are
not sufﬁciently effective, a differential scheme may be used to
protect high-voltage (HV) transmission lines. In this type of
relaying, the measurements from two (or multiple) ends of a
transmission line are compared. Transmitting the measure-
ment from one end to the other enables the comparison. The
decision to trip is made once the comparison indicates a
signiﬁcant difference between the measurements taken at the
transmission line end(s).
