Figure 3-9(A) shows one wafer of a wafer switch and its schematic symbol. Contact 1 is the point at
which current enters the wafer. It is always connected to the movable portion of the wafer. With the wafer
in the position shown, contact 1 is connected to both contact 5 and 6 through the movable portion. If the
movable portion was rotated slightly clockwise, contact 1 would only be connected to contact 5. This
arrangement is known as MAKE BEFORE BREAK because the switch makes a contact before breaking
the old contact.
