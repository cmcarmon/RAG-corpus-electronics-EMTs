Many sizes and form factors of receivers are manufactured. Portable personal types include pocket-sized or
hand-held  models  with  picture  sizes  of  2  to  4  in.  diagonal  for  monochrome  and  5  to  6  in.  for  color.  Large
screen sizes are available in monochrome where low cost and light weight are prime requirements. However,
except where portability is important, the majority of television program viewing is in color. The 19- and 27-
in. sizes dominate the market.
