where f1 is called the mark (binary 1) frequency and f2 is called the space (binary 0) frequency. The other type
is  continuous-phase  FSK.  The  continuous-phase  FSK  signal  is  generated  by  feeding  the  data  signal  into  a
frequency modulator, as shown in Fig. 69.6(b). This FSK signal is represented by
