When  applying  the  reduced-rank  approximation  of  a  matrix  as  speciﬁed  by  relationship  (14.103),  it  is
desirable that the gap between the so-called signal-level singular values and noise-level singular values be large
(i.e., sq – sq+1 >> 0). If this is true, then the issues of nonuniqueness and continuity of mapping do not arise.
Unfortunately, in many challenging applications, this gap is often small, and one must carefully examine the
consequences of this fact on the underlying problem being addressed. For example, in modeling empirical data
as a sum of exponentials, this gap is typically small, which in turn leads to potential undesirable algorithmic
sensitivities. We will examine the exponential modeling problem in a later subsection.
