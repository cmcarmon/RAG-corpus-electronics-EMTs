The concepts and advantages of ASCII are identical to those of EBCDIC. The important difference 
between the two coding systems lies in the 8-bit combinations assigned to represent the various 
alphabetic, numeric, and special characters. When using ASCII 8-bit code, you will notice the selection of 
bit patterns used in the positions differs from those used in EBCDIC. For example, let's look at the 
characters DP3 in both EBCDIC and ASCII to see how they compare.
