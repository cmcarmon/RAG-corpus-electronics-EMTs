The diode was introduced in the previous sections as a nonlinear device that is used in rectiﬁers and limiters.
These  are  applications  that  depend  on  the  nonlinear  nature  of  the  diode.  Typical  electronic  systems  are
composed  not  only  of  diodes  but  also  of  other  nonlinear  devices  such  as  transistors  (Section III).  In  analog
applications transistors are used to amplify weak signals (ampliﬁers) and to drive large loads (output stages).
For such situations it is desirable that the output be an ampliﬁed true reproduction of the input signal; therefore,
the transistors must operate as linear devices. However, the inherent nonlinearity of transistors results in an
output which is a “distorted” version of the input.
