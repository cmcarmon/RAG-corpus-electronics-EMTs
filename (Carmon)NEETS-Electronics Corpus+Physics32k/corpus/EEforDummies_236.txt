The shape of a circuit does matter for circuits involving high‐frequency 
 signals, such as radio‐frequency (RF) and microwave circuits. The layout, or 
placement of circuit components, must be designed with care to reduce noise 
and other undesired AC signals. Additionally, the proximity of bypass capaci-
tors (which you find out about in Chapter 7) to other circuit components can 
make a difference in the performance of many circuits.
