FIGURE 80.30  Thermomagnetic  recording  process.  (a)  The  Ô¨Åeld  of  the  electromagnet  helps  reverse  the  direction  of
magnetization in the area heated by the focused laser beam. (b) Lorentz micrograph of domains written thermomagnetically.
The  various  tracks  shown  here  were  written  at  different  laser  powers,  with  power  level  decreasing  from  top  to  bottom.
