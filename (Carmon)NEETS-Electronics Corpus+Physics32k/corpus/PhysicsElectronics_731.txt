We describe the basic AND, NAND, OR or NOR gates as being satisﬁed when the inputs
are such that a change in any one will change the output. A satisﬁed AND or NOR gate
has a true output, whereas a satisﬁed NAND or OR gate has a false output. We sometimes
identify the input logic variables A, B, C, etc. with an n-bit number ABC . . ..
