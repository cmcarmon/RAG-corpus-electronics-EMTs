For single mode fibers, a mode filter is used to eliminate the second-order mode from propagating
along the fiber. The propagation of the second-order mode will affect attenuation measurements. Fiber
attenuation caused by the second-order mode depends on the operating wavelength, the fiber bend radius
and length.
