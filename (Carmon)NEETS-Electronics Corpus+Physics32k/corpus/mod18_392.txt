unwanted echoes) and displays only moving target signals. Clutter is the appearance on a radar indicator
of confusing, unwanted echoes which interfere with the clear display of desired echoes. Clutter is the
result of echoes from land, water, weather, and so forth. The unwanted echoes can consist of GROUND
CLUTTER (echoes from surrounding land masses), SEA CLUTTER (echoes from the irregular surface of
the sea), or echoes from the clouds and rain. The problem is to find the desired echo in the midst of the
clutter. To do this, the mti system must be able to distinguish between fixed and moving targets and then
must eliminate only the fixed targets. This is accomplished by phase detection and pulse-to-pulse
comparison.
