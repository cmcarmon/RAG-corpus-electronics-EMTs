and  TR1’s  base  voltage  will  rise  exponentially 
from  2VCC  towards  +VCC. However,  TR1’s  base 
voltage  will  not  rise  much  above  0  V  because,  as 
soon as it reaches +0.7 V (sufficient to cause base 
current  to  flow),  TR1  will  begin  to  conduct.  As 
TR1  begins  to  turn  on,  its  collector  voltage  will 
rapidly fall from +VCC 0 V. This fall in voltage is 
transferred  to  the  base  of  TR2  via  C1 and,  as  a 
consequence,  TR2  will  turn  off.  C1 will  then 
charge  via  R3 and  TR2’s  base  voltage  will  rise 
exponentially from 2VCC towards +VCC. As before, 
TR2’s  base  voltage  will  not  rise  much  above  0  V 
because, as soon as it reaches +0.7 V (sufficient to 
cause  base  current  to  flow),  TR2  will  start  to 
conduct. The cycle is then repeated indefinitely. 
  The time for which the collector voltage of TR2 
is low and TRl is high (T1) will be determined by 
the time constant, R4 × C1. Similarly, the time for 
which the collector voltage of TR1 is low and TR2 
is  high  (T2)  will  be  determined  by  the  time 
constant, R3 × C1. 
  The following approximate relationships apply: 
 
T1 = 0.7 C2 R4 and  T2 = 0.7 C1 R3
Since one complete cycle of the output occurs in a 
time, T = T1 + T2, the periodic time of the output is 
given by: 
 
T = 0.7 (C2 R4 + C1 R3)
