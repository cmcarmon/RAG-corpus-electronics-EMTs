Before discussing the experimental evidence regarding these other sources of gravity, we need first to discuss Bondi's distinctions between different possible types of mass: (1) active mass (




m

a




{\displaystyle m_{a}}
) is the mass which acts as the source of a gravitational field; (2) passive mass (




m

p




{\displaystyle m_{p}}
) is the mass which reacts to a gravitational field; (3) inertial mass (




m

i




{\displaystyle m_{i}}
) is the mass which reacts to acceleration.





m

p




{\displaystyle m_{p}}
is the same as what we have earlier termed gravitational mass (




m

g




{\displaystyle m_{g}}
) in our discussion of the equivalence principle in the Basic propositions section.
In Newtonian theory,
The third law of action and reaction dictates that




m

a




{\displaystyle m_{a}}
and




m

p




{\displaystyle m_{p}}
must be the same.
On the other hand, whether




m

p




{\displaystyle m_{p}}
and




m

i




{\displaystyle m_{i}}
are equal is an empirical result.
In general relativity,
The equality of




m

p




{\displaystyle m_{p}}
and




m

i




{\displaystyle m_{i}}
is dictated by the equivalence principle.
There is no "action and reaction" principle dictating any necessary relationship between




m

a




{\displaystyle m_{a}}
and




m

p




{\displaystyle m_{p}}
.
