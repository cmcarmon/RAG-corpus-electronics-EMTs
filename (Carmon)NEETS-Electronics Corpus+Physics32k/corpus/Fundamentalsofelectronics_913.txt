As with the repetition code, we must question whether our (7,4) code’s error correction capability com-
pensates for the increased error probability due to the necessitated reduction in bit energy. Figure 6.23 shows
that if the signal-to-noise ratio is large enough channel coding yields a smaller error probability. Because the
bit stream emerging from the source decoder is segmented into four-bit blocks, the fair way of comparing
coded and uncoded transmission is to compute the probability of block error: the probability that any bit
in a block remains in error despite error correction and regardless of whether the error occurs in the data
or in coding buts. Clearly, our (7,4) channel code does yield smaller error rates, and is worth the additional
systems required to make it work.
Note that our (7,4) code has the length and number of data bits that perfectly ﬁts correcting single bit
errors. This pleasant property arises because the number of error patterns that can be corrected, 2N−K − 1,
equals the codeword length N. Codes that have 2N−K − 1 = N are known as Hamming codes, and the
following table (Table 6.4) provides the parameters of these codes. Hamming codes are the simplest single-bit
error correction codes, and the generator/parity check matrix formalism for channel coding and decoding
works for them.
