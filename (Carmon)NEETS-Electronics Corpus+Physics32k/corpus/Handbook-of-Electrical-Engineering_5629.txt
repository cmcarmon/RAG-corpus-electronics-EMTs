These  G-2  equations  are  simultaneously  solved  for  G-2  ddijs,  then  these  are  substituted  in  dPk  and  dPn
equations to calculate the partial derivatives of Pk and Pn with respect to dkn to see if Eqs. (61.75) for i =k and
i =n are satisÔ¨Åed. Then the process is repeated for the remaining pairs.
