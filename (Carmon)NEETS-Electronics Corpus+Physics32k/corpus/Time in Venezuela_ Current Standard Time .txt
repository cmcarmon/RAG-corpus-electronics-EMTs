In December 2007, Hugo Chávez changed, via decree, the official meridian to meridian 67° 30' W, the same used between 1912 and 1965. As result, the standard time was UTC−04:30 , half an hour behind the previous time which eventually led to an increase in energy consumption.
On 15 April 2016, President Nicolás Maduro announced that Venezuela would abandon Chávez's time change due to the shortage of electricity (the country's hydroelectric power has been hit by low water levels: prolonged drought caused by El Niño) in Venezuela, with a return to UTC−04:00 slated to begin on 1 May 2016 03:00:00.
