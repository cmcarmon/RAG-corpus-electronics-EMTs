Compensation for the voltage generated by the reference junction is typically performed by
a special circuit designed to measure temperature there and produce a corresponding voltage
to counter the reference junction’s effects. At this point you may wonder, ”If we have to re-
sort to some other form of temperature measurement just to overcome an idiosyncrasy with
thermocouples, then why bother using thermocouples to measure temperature at all? Why
not just use this other form of temperature measurement, whatever it may be, to do the job?”
The answer is this: because the other forms of temperature measurement used for reference
junction compensation are not as robust or versatile as a thermocouple junction, but do the
job of measuring room temperature at the reference junction site quite well. For example, the
thermocouple measurement junction may be inserted into the 1800 degree (F) ﬂue of a foundry
holding furnace, while the reference junction sits a hundred feet away in a metal cabinet at
ambient temperature, having its temperature measured by a device that could never survive
the heat or corrosive atmosphere of the furnace.
