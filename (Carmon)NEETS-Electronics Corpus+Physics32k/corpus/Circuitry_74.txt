The value marked on the body of a resistor is not its 
exact resistance. Some minor variation in resistance 
value is inevitable due to production tolerance. For 
example,  a  resistor  marked  100  $ and  produced 
within a tolerance of ±10% will have a value which 
falls  within  the  range  90  $ to  110  $. A similar 
component  with a tolerance of ±1%  would have a 
value  that  falls  within  the  range  99  $ to  101  $.
Thus, where accuracy is important it is essential to 
use close tolerance components. 
  Resistors are available in several series of fixed 
decade values, the number of values provided with 
each  series  being  governed  by 
tolerance 
involved.  In  order  to  cover  the  full  range  of 
resistance  values  using  resistors  having  a  ±20%
tolerance  it  will  be  necessary  to  provide  six  basic 
values (known as the E6  series. More values will 
be required in the series which offers a tolerance of 
±10%  and  consequently  the  E12  series  provides 
twelve basic values. The E24 series for resistors of 
±5%  tolerance  provides  no  fewer  than  24  basic
