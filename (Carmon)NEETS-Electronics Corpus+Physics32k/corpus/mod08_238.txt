Figure 2-14 and the other circuits you have been shown use capacitors to couple the signal in to and
out of the circuit (C1 and C4 in figure 2-14). As you remember from chapter 1, there are also other
methods of coupling signals from one stage to another. Transformer coupling is the most common
method used to couple rf amplifiers. Transformer coupling has many advantages over RC coupling for rf
amplifiers; for example, transformer coupling uses fewer components than capacitive coupling. It can also
provide a means of increasing the gain of the stage by using a step-up transformer for voltage gain. If a
current gain is required, a step-down transformer can be used.
