Born  in Albany,  New  York,  Henry  graduated  from Albany Acad-
emy and taught philosophy at Princeton University from 1832 to 1846.
He was the ﬁrst secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. He conducted
several experiments on electromagnetism and developed powerful elec-
tromagnets that could lift objects weighing thousands of pounds. Inter-
estingly,  Joseph  Henry  discovered  electromagnetic  induction  before
Faraday  but  failed  to  publish  his  ﬁndings.  The  unit  of  inductance, the
henry, was named after him.
