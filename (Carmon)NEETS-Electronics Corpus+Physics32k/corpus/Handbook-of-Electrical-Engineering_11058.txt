Stimulating Coils
Air-cored coils are used because all known ferromagnetic materials saturate at the high ﬂux densities used with
eddy-current stimulation. Two types of coils are used: (1) annular and (2) coplanar, sometimes called ﬁgure
eight,  osculating,  or  butterﬂy.  Most  coils  are  annular  in  shape  and  the  radius  is  chosen  on  the  basis  of  the
distance to the target tissue to be stimulated.
