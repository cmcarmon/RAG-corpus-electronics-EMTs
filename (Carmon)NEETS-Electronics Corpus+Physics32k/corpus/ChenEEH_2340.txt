A rectangular waveguide is among the most commonly used
waveguides. This is due to its manifacturing simplicity, low
cost, and low-loss operation up to 100 GHz. Rectangular wave-
guides are also capable of handling very high-power micro-
wave signals, and they are suitable for operations in outdoor
environments. Because these waveguides are made of metals
such as brass, copper, silver, or iron, they are heavy. Their
