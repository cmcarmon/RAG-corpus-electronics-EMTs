In quantum mechanics, the Wigner 3-j symbols, also called 3-jm symbols, are an alternative to Clebschâ€“Gordan coefficients for the purpose of adding angular momenta. While the two approaches address exactly the same physical problem, the 3-j symbols do so more symmetrically, and thus have greater and simpler symmetry properties than the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.
