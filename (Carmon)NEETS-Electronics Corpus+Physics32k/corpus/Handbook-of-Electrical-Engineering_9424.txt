The physical replication of hardware is perhaps the most common form of fault tolerance used in systems. As
semiconductor components have become smaller and less expensive, the concept of hardware redundancy has
passive
become more common and more practical. There are three basic forms of hardware redundancy. First, 
techniques use the concept of fault masking to hide the occurrence of faults and prevent the faults from resulting
. Passive approaches are designed to achieve fault tolerance without requiring any action on the part
in 
of the system or an operator. Passive techniques, in their most basic form, do not provide for the detection of
faults  but  simply  mask  the  faults.  An  example  of  a  passive  approach  is  triple  modular  redundancy  (TMR),
which  is  illustrated  in  Fig.  93.1.  In  the  TMR  system  three  identical  units  perform  identical  functions,  and  a
majority vote is performed on the output.
