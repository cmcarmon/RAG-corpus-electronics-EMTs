Flags are widely used in digital systems to indicate a change of state and all microprocessors have a set of
ﬂags  which,  among  other  things,  are  used  in  deciding  whether  a  program  branch  should  or  should  not  be
made.  Thus  the  8086  family  of  microprocessors  [Intel,  1989],  for  example,  has  a  group  of  nine  ﬂags—three
control  ﬂags  used  to  control  particular  modes  of  operation  of  the  processor  and  six  status  ﬂags  indicating
whether  certain  conditions  have  resulted  from  the  most  recent  arithmetic  or  logical  instruction:  zero,  carry,
auxiliary carry, overﬂow, sign and parity. For convenience, although they all act independently, these ﬂags are
grouped together into what is known as the ﬂag register or program status word register.
