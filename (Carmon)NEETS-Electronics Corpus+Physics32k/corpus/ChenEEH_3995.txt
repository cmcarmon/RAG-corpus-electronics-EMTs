The retiming was Ô¨Årst proposed by Leiserson et al. (1983). It
is equivalent to moving around the delays in the DFG such
that the total number of delays in any loop remains unaltered.
The retiming can be applied to a single-rate DFG to reduce
the iteration period in a programmable multiprocessor imple-
