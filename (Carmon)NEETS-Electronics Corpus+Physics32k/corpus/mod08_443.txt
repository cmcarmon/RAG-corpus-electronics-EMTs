During the first half cycle, the flux aids in the left core and opposes in the right core, as shown in
figure 3-37, view (A). During the second half cycle, the flux opposes in the left core and aids in the right
core, as shown in view (B). Regardless of the amount of load flux or polarity of the load voltage, there is
no net effect of load flux on control flux.
