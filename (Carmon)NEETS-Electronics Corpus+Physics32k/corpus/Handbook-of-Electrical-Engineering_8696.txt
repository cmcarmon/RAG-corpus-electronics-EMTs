Linker: A computer program which takes one or more object ﬁles, assembles them into blocks which are to
ﬁt in particular blocks in memory, and resolves all external (and possibly internal) references to other
segments of a program and to libraries of precompiled subroutines. The output of the linker is a single
ﬁle called an executable image which has all addresses and references resolved and which the operating
system can load and run on request.
