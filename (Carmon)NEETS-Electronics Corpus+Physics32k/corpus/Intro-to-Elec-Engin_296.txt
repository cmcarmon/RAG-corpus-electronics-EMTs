which results are printed, plotted, or reported to PROBE, TMAX is the maximum time increment
between computed values, and UIC is a keyword that causes PSpice to use initial conditions
speciﬁed for inductors and capacitors in the element statements. In case of omission, TSTART
defaults to zero and TMAX to (TSTOP − TSTART)/50. If UIC is omitted, PSpice computes
initial conditions by assuming that the circuit is dc steady state prior to t = 0. Let us present an
illustrative example.
