signal, STB. When the central processor is ready for the data it selects the port by setting the correct address
bits on the device select inputs. This enables the 3S output buffers and data is routed to the processor data bus
via  the  DO  lines.  This  device  also  includes  a  service  request  ﬂip-ﬂop  to  generate  an  interrupt  signal  to  the
processor when the data is ready. In the alternative mode of use, with the mode input at 1, the device select
logic routes data from the processor, now connected to the DI inputs, so the 8212 acts as an output port. The
data is immediately available to the peripheral unit on the DO lines, as the 3S output buffers are permanently
enabled. A more sophisticated range of input and output facilities is provided by most microprocessor manu-
facturers in the form of programmable input/output ports or peripheral interfaces. These are special registers
with appropriate buffers and additional built-in control and status registers to facilitate proper system operation.
The majority of input/output devices use 3S bidirectional buffers which switch to the high-impedance state
when not enabled. Some input/output ports, however, such as the 8051 family of microcontrollers and deriv-
atives, are provided with quasi-bidirectional ports. In this construction, each port pin has an internal pull-up
transistor, as shown in Fig. 81.36. For the port pin to be operative as an input the port latch must contain a 1,
so that the output FET driver is turned off. (All port latches in the 8051 are set by the reset function.) Under
this condition, the pin voltage is pulled high but can be taken low by an external signal when required. These
inputs can, therefore, be driven in a normal way by TTL and MOS circuits and can also cope with open-collector
or open-drain circuits using the pull-up transistors as load resistors.
