Conducting its first flight in January 1958, the XKD4R-1 was tested extensively by the United States Navy, launches usually being conducted from McDonnell F3H Demon fighters. Although satisfactory, the RP-70 was not produced; instead, the improved RP-76 was developed, flying in 1959 and being produced for both the U.S. Air Force and Navy, becoming the AQM-38 in 1962.
