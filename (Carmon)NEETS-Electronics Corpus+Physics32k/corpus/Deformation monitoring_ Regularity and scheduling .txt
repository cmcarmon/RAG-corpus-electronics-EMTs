The monitoring regularity and time interval of the measurements must be considered depending on the application and object to be monitored. Objects can undergo both rapid, high frequency movement and slow, gradual movement. For example, a bridge might oscillates with a period of a few seconds due to the influence of traffic and wind and also be shifting gradually due to tectonic changes.
Regularity: ranges from a days, weeks or years for manual monitoring and continuous for automatic monitoring systems.
Measurement interval: ranges from fractions of a second to hours.
