Einstein's constant or Einstein's gravitational constant, denoted κ (kappa), is the coupling constant appearing in the Einstein field equation which can be written:





G

α
γ


=
κ

T

α
γ





{\displaystyle G^{\alpha \gamma }=\kappa T^{\alpha \gamma }~}

where Gαγ is the Einstein tensor and Tαγ is the stress–energy tensor.
This equation relates to the curvature of space and time, telling that stress–energy is what causes the disturbance of spacetime, thus gravitation. Einstein used Newton's law of universal gravitation in his field equations, and the constant of κ is directly proportional to Newton's gravitational constant G:

{\displaystyle \kappa ={\frac {8\pi G}{c^{2}}}\approx 1.866\times 10^{-26}{\rm {\ m\ kg^{-1}}}}

The above is for the stress-energy tensor in units of mass density (i.e., mass per volume). Writing Einstein's constant depends on how the stress–energy tensor is defined, so an alternative choice for T with units of energy density (i.e., energy per volume) yields
