Cleanliness is essential for efficient, effective soldering. Solder will not adhere to dirty, greasy, or 
oxidized surfaces. Heated metals tend to oxidize rapidly. This is the reason the oxides, scale, and dirt 
must be removed by chemical or mechanical means. Grease or oil films can be removed with a suitable 
solvent. Connections to be soldered should be cleaned just prior to the actual soldering operation.
