Industrial ecology is an emerging Ô¨Åeld that views manufacturing and other industrial activity including forestry,
agriculture, mining, and other extractive sectors, as an integral component of global natural systems. In doing
so, it takes a systems view of design and manufacturing activities so as to reduce or, more desirably, eliminate
the environmental impacts of materials, manufacturing processes, technologies, and products across their life
cycles, including use and disposal. It incorporates, among other things, research involving energy supply and
use, new materials, new technologies and technological systems, basic sciences, economics, law, management,
and social sciences.
