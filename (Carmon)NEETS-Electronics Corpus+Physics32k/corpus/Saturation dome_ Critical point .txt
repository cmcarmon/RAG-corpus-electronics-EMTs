The point at the very top of the dome is called the critical point. This point is where the saturated liquid and saturated vapor lines meet. Past this point, it is impossible for a liquidâ€“vapor transformation to occur. It is also where the critical temperature and critical pressure meet. Beyond this point, it is also impossible to distinguish between the liquid and vapor phases.
