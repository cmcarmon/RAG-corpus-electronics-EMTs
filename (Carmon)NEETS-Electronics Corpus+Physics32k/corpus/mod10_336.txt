The 27-day sunspot cycle causes variations in the ionization density of the layers on a day-to-day 
basis. The fluctuations in the F2 layer are greater than for any other layer. For this reason, precise 
predictions on a day-to-day basis of the critical frequency of the F2 layer are not possible. In calculating 
frequencies for long-distance communications, allowances for the fluctuations of the F2 layer must be 
made.
