To embark on determination of relay settings, the following
data have to be made available for an overcurrent relay either
through a calculation or through simple selection of design
options: time dial, tap (pick-up setting), and operating char-
acteristic type; current transformer ratio for each relay loca-
tion; and extreme (minimum and maximum) short circuit
values for fault currents. The mentioned data applied to the
relaying system shown in Figure 9.10 are provided in Table 9.1.
The values are determined only for relays R2 and R3 as an
example. Similar approaches will yield corresponding values
for relay R1.
