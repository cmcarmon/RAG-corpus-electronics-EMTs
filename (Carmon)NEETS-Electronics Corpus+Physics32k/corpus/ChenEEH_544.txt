At high doping levels, however, the lifetimes decrease faster
than the inverse doping concentration. The reason is that a
different recombination mechanism, called Auger recombin-
ation, becomes important. In an Auger process, an electron
and a hole recombine without involving trap levels, and the
released energy (of the order of the energy gap) is transferred
to another carrier (a hole in p-type material and an electron in
n-type material). Auger recombination is the inverse of impact
ionization, where energetic carriers cause the generation of
electron-hole pairs. Since two electrons (in n-type material)
or two holes (in p-type material) are involved in the Auger
recombination process, the recombination lifetime associated
with this process is inversely proportional to the square of the
majority carrier concentration; that is:
