As  observed  by  Bucher  and  Hayes  [1980],  supercomputer  I/O  can  be  characterized  almost  entirely  by
sequential I/O. Typically, computation parameters are moved in bulk from disk to in-memory data structures,
and  results  are  periodically  written  back  to  disk.  These  workloads  demand  large  bandwidth  and  minimum
latency, but are characterized by low throughput. Contrast this with transaction processing, which is charac-
terized by enormous numbers of random accesses, relatively small units of work, and a demand for moderate
latency with very high throughput.
