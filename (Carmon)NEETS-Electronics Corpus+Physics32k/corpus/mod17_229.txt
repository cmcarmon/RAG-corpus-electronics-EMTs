You might draw the conclusion that an agc network is not necessary when the receiver is operating
on a single station. However, this is not true; atmospheric conditions may cause the signal strength to vary
(fade in and out), or the antenna may receive components of the signal which have traveled along
different paths. For example, one component may travel directly from the antenna, and another may have
been reflected from a distant object. The two signals will sometimes be in phase and at other times be out
of phase, thus tending to reinforce or cancel each other. The result is a variation in signal strength at the
receiver antenna. This variation in signal strength is often referred to as FADING. The effect of fading in
the output signal voltage of an rf stage is best demonstrated by the following example: An rf amplifier
connected to a receiving antenna has a voltage gain of 100. If the antenna receives an input signal of 10
microvolts, the output voltage is computed as follows:
