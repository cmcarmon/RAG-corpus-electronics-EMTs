The fact that a compass needle always aligns itself in a particular direction, regardless of its location
on earth, indicates that the earth is a huge natural magnet. The distribution of the magnetic force about the
earth is the same as that which might be produced by a giant bar magnet running through the center of the
earth (fig. 1-10). The magnetic axis of the earth is located about 15º��IURP�LWV�JHRJUDSKLFDO�D[LV�WKHUHE\
locating the magnetic poles some distance from the geographical poles. The ability of the north pole of
the compass needle to point toward the north geographical pole is due to the presence of the magnetic
pole nearby. This magnetic pole is named the magnetic North Pole. However, in actuality, it must have
the polarity of a south magnetic pole since it attracts the north pole of a compass needle. The reason for
this conflict in terminology can be traced to the early users of the compass. Knowing little about magnetic
effects, they called the end of the compass needle that pointed towards the north geographical pole, the
north pole of a compass. With our present knowledge of magnetism, we know the north pole of a compass
needle (a small bar magnet) can be attracted only by an unlike magnetic pole, that is, a pole of south
magnetic polarity.
