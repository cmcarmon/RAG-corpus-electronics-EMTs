Figure 3.25: Comparing the ﬁrst, simpler, ﬁgure with the slightly more complicated second ﬁgure, we
see two diﬀerences. First of all, more circuits (all those containing linear elements in fact) have equivalent
circuits that contain equivalents. Secondly, the terminal and source variables are now complex amplitudes,
which carries the implicit assumption that the voltages and currents are single complex exponentials, all
having the same frequency.
