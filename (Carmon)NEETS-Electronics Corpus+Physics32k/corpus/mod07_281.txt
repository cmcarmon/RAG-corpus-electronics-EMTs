Zener diodes of various sorts are used for many purposes, but their most widespread use is as voltage 
regulators. Once the breakdown voltage of a Zener diode is reached, the voltage across the diode remains 
almost constant regardless of the supply voltage. Therefore they hold the voltage across the load at a 
constant level. This characteristic makes Zener diodes ideal voltage regulators, and they are found in 
almost all solid-state circuits in this capacity.
