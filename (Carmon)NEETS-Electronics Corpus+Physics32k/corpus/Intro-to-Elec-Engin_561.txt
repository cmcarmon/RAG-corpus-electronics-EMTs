stops being incremented again. The value of the counter becomes the binary code for the analog
voltage Vin, since the number of clock pulses passing through the control logic gate for a time t
is proportional to the analog signal Vin. Dual-ramp A/D converters can provide accuracy at low
cost, even though the process is slow because a double clock pulse count is an inherent part of
the process.
