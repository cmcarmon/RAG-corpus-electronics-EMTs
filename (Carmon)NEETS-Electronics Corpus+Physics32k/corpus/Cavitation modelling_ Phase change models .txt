Phase change models represent the mass transfer between the phases. In cavitation, pressure is responsible for the mass transfer between liquid and vapor phases. This is in contrast to boiling, in which the temperature causes the phase change. There are two general categories of phase change models used for cavitation: the barotropic models and equilibrium models. This section will briefly discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each type.
