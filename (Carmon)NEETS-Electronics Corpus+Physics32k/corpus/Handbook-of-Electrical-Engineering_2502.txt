Modern ampliﬁers abound in the form of integrated circuits (ICs), which contain transistors, diodes, and other
structures  diffused  into  single-crystal  dice. As  an  introduction  to  these  ICs,  it  is  convenient  to  examine  sing-
transistor ampliﬁers, which in fact are also widely used in their own right as discrete circuits — and indeed much
more complicated discrete signal-conditioning circuits are frequently found following sensors of various sorts.
There are two basic forms of transistor, the bipolar family and the ﬁeld-effect family, and both appear in ICs.
They  differ  in  their  modes  of  operation  but  may  be  incorporated  into  circuits  in  quite  similar  ways.  To
understand  elementary  circuits,  there  is  no  need  to  become  too  familiar  with  the  physics  of  transistors,  but
some basic facts about their electrical properties must be known.
