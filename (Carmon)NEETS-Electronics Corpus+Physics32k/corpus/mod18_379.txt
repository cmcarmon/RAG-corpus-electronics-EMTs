The performance efficiency of radar receivers is often greatly decreased by interference from one or
more of several possible sources. Weather and sea return are the most common of these interference
sources, especially for radar systems that operate above 3,000 megahertz. Unfavorable weather conditions
can completely mask all radar returns and render the system useless. Electromagnetic interference from
external sources, such as the deliberate interference by an enemy, called jamming or electronic counter
measures (ECM), can also render a radar system useless. Many special circuits have been designed to
help the radar receiver counteract the effects of external interference. These circuits are called VIDEO
ENHANCEMENT FEATURES, ANTIJAMMING CIRCUITS, or ELECTRONIC COUNTER-
COUNTERMEASURES (ECCM) CIRCUITS. This section will discuss, in general terms, some of the
more common video enhancement features associated with radar receivers.
