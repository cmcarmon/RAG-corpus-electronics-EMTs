The key to understanding the Growth and Underinvestment Archetype is in the delay in investment. This delay causes the second balancing loop to have longer cycle times than the first balancing loop. That in turn has the following effect:
Since the second balancing loop has a shorter loop cycle, it causes the current state to be reduced, which in turn decreases the slowing action. This happens before an investment is made, in effect reducing the perceived need for investment.
In effect, the first and second reinforcing loop act together as a reinforcing loop to restrict growth.
If it were not for the delay, the whole system would work optimally thanks to timely investments.
