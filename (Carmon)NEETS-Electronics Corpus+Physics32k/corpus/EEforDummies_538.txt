Creating N‐types and P‐types
A pure semiconductor can be altered to change its electrical properties. The 
exact explanation of this process, which is called doping (relax; it has nothing to 
do with steroids), involves some fascinating physics that I won’t go into it here. 
But the bottom line is this: Doping creates variants of semiconductor materials 
that (depending on the specific type of doping) either have more electrons or 
fewer electrons than the pure semiconductor material. These variants follow:
