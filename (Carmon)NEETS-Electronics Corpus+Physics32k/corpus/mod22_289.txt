Programs written in procedure-oriented languages, unlike those in symbolic languages, may be used 
with a number of different computer makes and models. This feature greatly reduces reprogramming 
expenses when changing from one computer system to another. Other advantages to procedure-oriented 
languages are (1) they are easier to learn than symbolic languages; (2) they require less time to write; (3) 
they provide better documentation; and (4) they are easier to maintain. However, there are some 
disadvantages of procedure-oriented languages. They require more space in memory, and they process 
data at a slower rate than symbolic languages.
