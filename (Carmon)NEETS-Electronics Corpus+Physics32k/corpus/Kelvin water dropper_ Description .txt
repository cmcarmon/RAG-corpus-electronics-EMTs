A typical setup is shown in Fig. 1. A reservoir of water or other conducting liquid (top, green) is connected to two hoses that release two falling streams of drops, which land in two buckets or containers (bottom, blue and red). Each stream passes (without touching) through a metal ring or open cylinder which is electrically connected to the opposite receiving container; the left ring (blue) is connected to the right bucket, while the right ring (red) is connected to the left bucket. The containers must be electrically insulated from each other and from electrical ground. Similarly, the rings must be electrically isolated from each other and their environment. It is necessary for the streams to break into separate droplets before reaching the containers. Typically, the containers are made of metal and the rings are connected to them by wires.
The simple construction makes this device popular in physics education as a laboratory experiment for students.
