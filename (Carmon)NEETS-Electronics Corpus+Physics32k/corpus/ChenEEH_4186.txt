congestion problems will be reduced. Any error detected re-
quires retransmission of the entire message. If the message is a
megabytes ﬁle, the whole ﬁle will need to be retransmitted. No
overlap of transmission is possible. Message switching is gen-
erally not suitable for the interactive trafﬁc due to a long delay.
