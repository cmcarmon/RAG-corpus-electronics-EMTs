Next, we will attempt to answer the following question: What is the rela-
tionship between the amplifier output vO and its input vIN? This relationship
will describe the gain of the amplifier. Notice here an advantage of the satura-
tion discipline
our constraint that the circuit inputs will be chosen so that
the MOSFET is always in saturation allows us to focus on the saturation region
of operation of the MOSFET and ignore its triode and cutoff region operation.
We will begin by formulating the output voltage vO as a function of the
input voltage vIN. Any of the methods described in Chapters 2 and 3 can be
used to analyze this circuit. We will use the node method here. The ground
node is marked in the circuit in Figure 7.20, and so are the node voltages vO,
vIN, and VS. Since the current into the MOSFET gate is zero, the node with
voltage vO is the only interesting node in the circuit. Writing the node equation,
we get
