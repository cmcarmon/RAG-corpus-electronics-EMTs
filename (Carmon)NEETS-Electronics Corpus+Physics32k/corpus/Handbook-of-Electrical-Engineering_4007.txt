FIGURE  39.14 Cross-sectional  view  of  a  microwave  bipolar  transistor  (BJT).  The  cross-hatched  areas  indicate  metal
electrodes. The electrode pattern on the surface is interdigitated with the base electrodes connected together at one end and
the emitter electrodes connected together at the other end. Due to the interdigitated structure, there will always be one more
base electrode than the number of emitter electrodes. The n+, p, nâ€“, and nc
+ designations indicate the impurity doping type
and relative concentration level. This device has the collector electrode on the bottom of the device.
