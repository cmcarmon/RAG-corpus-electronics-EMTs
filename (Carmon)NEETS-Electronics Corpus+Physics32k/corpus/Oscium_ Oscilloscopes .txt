Oscium produces a series of oscilloscopes that work with both a smartphone and a tablet. The original oscilloscope was the iMSO-104, a mixed signal oscilloscope that was released in 2011. The iMSO-104 supports one channel of analog and four digital channels, and its capabilities include triggering, running measurements, the ability to freeze the display, screen shot, data capture, e-mail, and configuration saving. In 2013 they released the iMSO-204, which added a second analog channel, and increased its processing rate from 12MSPS to 50MSPS, and its memory from 240 to 1000 points. In 2017, they released the iMSO-204x which added a universal platform support (iOS, Android, PC, Mac) to the oscilloscope line.
