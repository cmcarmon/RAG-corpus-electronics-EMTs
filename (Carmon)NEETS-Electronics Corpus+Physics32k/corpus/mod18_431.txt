plane. The coils (N-S) which produce a horizontal field are called the VERTICAL DEFLECTION COILS 
and the coils (E-W) which produce a vertical field are called the HORIZONTAL DEFLECTION COILS. 
This may be more clearly understood if you recall that an electron beam will be deflected at right angles
