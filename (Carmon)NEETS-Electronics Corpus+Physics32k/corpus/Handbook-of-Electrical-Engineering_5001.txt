Other  causes  of  extrinsic  breakdown  are  associated  with  particular  defects  in  the  dielectric  or  with  the
environmental conditions under which the dielectric material is employed. For example, some dielectrics may
contain gas-ﬁlled cavities that are inherent with the porous structure of the dielectric or that may be inadvert-
ently  introduced  either  during  the  manufacturing  process  or  created  under  load  cycling.  If  the  operating
electrical ﬁeld is sufﬁciently elevated to cause the gas within the cavities to undergo discharge, the dielectric
will  be  subjected  to  both  physical  and  chemical  degradation  by  the  partial  discharges;  should  the  discharge
process be sustained over a sufﬁciently long period, breakdown will eventually ensue.
