The simplest SAW transducers are single-phase bidirectional transducers. Because of their symmetrical nature,
SAW energy is launched equally in both directions from the transducer. In a two- transducer conﬁguration,
half the energy (3 dB) is lost at the transmitter, and reciprocally, only half the energy can be received at the
receiver. This yields a net 6-dB loss in a ﬁlter. However, by adding nonsymmetry into the transducer, either by
electrical multiphases or nonsymmetry in reﬂection and regeneration, energy can be unidirectionally directed
yielding a theoretical minimum 0-dB loss.
