The testing of MEMS devices is intrinsically more complex
than the testing of ICs because of the integrated electronic and
mechanical characters of MEMS. That is, both the electronic
and the micromechanical aspects of a chip with moving parts
have to be tested at some point in the prototype and mass
production stages. For ICs, testing involves only electronic
inputs and outputs although temperature, radiation, and
other effects are also of interest. For MEMS, the inputs can
also be vibrations and other accelerations or particular condi-
tions of pressure, humidity, and chemical vapor composition,
among many other ambient parameters. The production of the
required input conditions for the operational testing of diverse
MEMS devices is complex and costly as is the measurement of
‘‘cross’’ sensitivities (e.g., the inﬂuence of unavoidable tem-
perature and humidity variations on chemical sensors). Only
limited testing of MEMS can be done at the wafer level. Testing
of fully packaged devices is usually needed. The ability of
MEMS to withstand aging of the sensitive components can
be problematic to determine in a testing laboratory. The cali-
bration of MEMS sensors, to obtain their quantitative input–
output relationships, is another important and nontrivial part
of their testing. Setting up the correct environments for MEMS
calibration and determining their conditions independent of
the MEMS to be calibrated are also challenging. Testing and
calibration of MEMS are frequently done in the same experi-
mental arrangements.
