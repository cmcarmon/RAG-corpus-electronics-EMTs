MOSFET Ampliﬁers
Because the same small-signal equivalent circuits apply to both the JFET and the MOSFETs, all
the equations developed for the JFET ampliﬁers hold good for the MOSFET ampliﬁers, so long
as gm and ro are computed properly. For the depletion MOSFET the equations for gm and ro, given
by Equations (7.4.4) and (7.4.5), are the same as for the JFET. For the enhancement MOSFET,
they are given by Equations (7.4.9) and (7.4.10).
