13.2   What  frequency  corresponds  to  the  13  m 
 
13.3   A signal in a cable propagates at two-thirds 
of  the  speed  of  light.  If  an  RF  signal  at  50 
 
MHz  is  fed  to  the  cable,  determine  the 
 
 
wavelength in the cable. 
13.4   An  AM  broadcast  receiver  has  an  IF  of  
470 kHz. If the receiver is to be tuned over 
 
the  medium  wave  broadcast  band  from  
 
550 kHz to 1.6 MHz, determine the required 
 
 
local oscillator tuning range. 
13.5   The data shown in Table 13.4 was obtained 
during an  experiment  on  an  IF  bandpass 
 
filter.  Plot 
 
response 
 
characteristic and use it to determine the IF 
frequency,  bandwidth  and  Q-factor  of  the 
 
 
filter. 
13.6  Refer  to  the  IF  amplifier/AM  demodulator 
circuit  shown  in  Fig.  13.17.  Identify  the 
 
 
component(s) that provide: 
(a)  a tuned collector load for TR1
 
(b)  base bias for TR1
(c)  coupling of the signal from the IF
