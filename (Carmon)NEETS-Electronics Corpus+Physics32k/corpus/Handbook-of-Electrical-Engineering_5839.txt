The secondary feeders form a mesh or grid that is supplied by transformers at the node points. The multiple
supply assures higher reliability and better load sharing. The loads are connected directly to the low-voltage
grid,  without  any  protection  equipment.  The  network  is  protected  by  fuses  and  network  protector  circuit
breakers  installed  at  the  secondary  transformers. A  short  circuit  blows  the  fuses  and  limits  the  current.  The
network protectors automatically open on reverse current and reclose when the voltage on the primary feeder
is restored after a fault.
