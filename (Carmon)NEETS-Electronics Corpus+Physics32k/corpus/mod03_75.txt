The first problem is solved by the use of hairsprings attached to each end of the coil as shown in
figure 1-7. These hairsprings can also be used to make the electrical connections to the coil. With the use
of hairsprings, the coil will return to its initial position when there is no current. The springs will also tend
to resist the movement of the coil when there is current through the coil. When the attraction between the
magnetic fields (from the permanent magnet and the coil) is exactly equal to the force of the hairsprings,
the coil will stop moving toward the magnet.
