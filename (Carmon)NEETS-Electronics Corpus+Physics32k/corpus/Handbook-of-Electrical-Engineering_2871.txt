• poor or inconsistent solder paste quality
• inappropriate solder pad design/shape/size/trace connections
• substrate artwork or production problems, e.g., mismatch of copper and mask, warped substrate
• solder paste deposition problems, e.g., wrong volume or location
• component lead problems, e.g., poor coplanarity or poor tinning of leads
• placement errors, e.g., part rotation or X–Y offsets
• reﬂow proﬁle, e.g., preheat ramp too fast or too slow; wrong temperatures created on substrate
• board handling problems, e.g., boards getting jostled prior to reﬂow.
