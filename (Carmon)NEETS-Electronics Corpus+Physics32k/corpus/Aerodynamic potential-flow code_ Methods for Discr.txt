constant strength - simple, large number of panels required
linear varying strength - reasonable answer, little difficulty in creating well-posed problems
quadratic varying strength - accurate, more difficult to create a well-posed problem
Some techniques are commonly used to model surfaces.
Body Thickness by line sources
Body Lift by line doublets
Wing Thickness by constant source panels
Wing Lift by constant pressure panels
Wing-Body Interface by constant pressure panels
