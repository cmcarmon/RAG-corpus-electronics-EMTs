choose an appropriate capacitor. The lower the frequency range, the 
higher the capacitor you should choose. (Assume that R1 and R2 will 
be somewhere in the 10 kΩ to 1 MΩ range.) For many low‐frequency 
applications, capacitor values of between 0.1 μF and 10 μF work well. For 
higher‐frequency applications, choose a capacitor in the range of 0.01 μF 
to 0.001 μF.
