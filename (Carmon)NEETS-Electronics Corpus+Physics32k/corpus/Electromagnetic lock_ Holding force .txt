A magnetic lock has a metal plate surrounded by a coil of wire that can be magnetized. The number of coils determines the holding force which characterizes the lock:
Micro Size: 275 lbf (1,220 N) holding force.
Mini Size: 650 lbf (2,900 N) holding force
Midi Size: 800 lbf (3,600 N) holding force
Standard Size: 1,200 lbf (5,300 N) holding force.
Shear Lock: 2,000 lbf (8,900 N) holding force
The standard size electromagnetic lock is used as a gate lock.
