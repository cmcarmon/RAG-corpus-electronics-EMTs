Magnetic pick-up responds to the movement of a toothed ferrous disk. 
The  pulse  repetition  frequency  of  the  output  is  proportional  to  the 
angular velocity. 
Turbine  rotor driven  by  fluid.  Turbine  interrupts infra-red  beam. Pulse 
repetition frequency of output is proportional to flow rate.
