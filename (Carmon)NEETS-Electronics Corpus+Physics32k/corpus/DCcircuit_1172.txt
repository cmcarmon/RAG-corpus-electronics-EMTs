These ampacity ratings are given for copper conductors in ”free air” (maximum typical
air circulation), as opposed to wires placed in conduit or wire trays. As you will notice, the
table fails to specify ampacities for small wire sizes. This is because the NEC concerns itself
primarily with power wiring (large currents, big wires) rather than with wires common to
low-current electronic work.
