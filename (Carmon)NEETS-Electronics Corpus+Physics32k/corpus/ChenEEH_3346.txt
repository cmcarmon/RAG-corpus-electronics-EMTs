The computation of the generator electrical power output Pe
for the fault-on system in Figure 7.15 requires a little more
work. Looking from the generator terminal bus, the effective
Thevenin voltage is 1ï¬€0[x=( x
Next, the effective Thevenin reactance is the parallel equivalent
of reactance x and the reactance x=2, which is x=3. Therefore,
the electrical power Pe during the fault-on period is given by:
