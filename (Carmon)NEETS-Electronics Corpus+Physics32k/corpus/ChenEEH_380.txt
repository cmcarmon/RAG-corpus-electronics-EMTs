1 Since the signal level that an op-amp can handle without distortion is
ﬁnite and the circuits generate noise, dynamic range is limited. To maximize
dynamic range, the ﬁrst- and second-order blocks in equation 4.7 are cascaded
in Figure 4.4 in the order of increasing Q values, and the gain constants are
chosen such that the signal level throughout the cascade stays constant.
