Electromagnetic radiation is quantized in particles called photons, the particle aspect of its wave–particle duality. Photons are best explained by quantum mechanics. Although photons are zero-rest mass particles, they have the properties of energy and momentum, and thus exhibit the property of mass as they travel at light speed. The photon exhibits the properties of a massive particle as follows:




p
=



h
λ



=
M
c
,


{\displaystyle p={\dfrac {h}{\lambda }}=Mc,}

where p is momentum, h is Planck's constant, λ is wavelength, M is relativistic mass of the particle, and c is speed of light in vacuum. This expression shows the wave–particle duality.

{\displaystyle E=Mc^{2}=pc}

is the mass-energy relationship where E is the energy. Then

{\displaystyle p={\dfrac {E}{c}}}

So the mass of the particle of which the photon exhibits the properties, satisfies the equations

{\displaystyle M=p/c={\dfrac {h}{c\lambda }}.}

The generation of radiation pressure results from the momentum property of photons, specifically, changing the momentum when incident radiation strikes a surface. The surface exerts a force on the photons in changing their momentum by Newton's Second Law. A reactive force is applied to the body by Newton's Third Law.
The orientation of a reflector determines the component of momentum normal to its surface, and also affects the frontal area of the surface facing the energy source. Each factor contributes a cosine function, reducing the pressure on the surface. The pressure experienced by a perfectly reflecting planar surface is then:
