One variation of the typical rectiﬁer is the Cockroft-
Walton circuit used to obtain high voltages without the
necessity of providing a high-voltage transformer. The
circuit in Fig. 5.8 multiplies the peak secondary voltage
by a factor of six. The steady-state voltage level at each
ﬁlter  capacitor  node  is  shown  in  the  ﬁgure.  Adding
additional stages increases the load voltage further. As
in  other  rectiﬁer  circuits,  the  value  of  the  capacitors
will  determine  the  amount  of  ripple  in  the  output
waveform for given load resistance values. In general,
the capacitors in a lower voltage stage should be larger
than in the next highest voltage stage.
