Synthetic Apertures
In applications such as air- and space-based radar, size and weight constraints prohibit the use of very large
antennas. For instance, if the L-band (23.5-cm wavelength) radar imaging system on the Seasat satellite (800-km
altitude,  launched  in  1978)  had  a  minimum  resolution  speciﬁcation  of  23.5 m,  then,  using  the  Rayleigh
resolution  criteria,  the  aperture  would  need  to  be  8  km  long.  In  order  to  attain  the  desired  resolution,  an
aperture is “synthesized” from data collected with a physically small (10 m) antenna traversing an 8-km ﬂight
