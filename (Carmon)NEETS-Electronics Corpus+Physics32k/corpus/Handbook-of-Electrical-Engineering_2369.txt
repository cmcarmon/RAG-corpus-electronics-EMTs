FEDAS (Field Effect Device Analysis System) is a two-dimensional device simulator that simulates MOSFETs,
JFETs, and MESFETs by considering only those carriers that form the channel. The Poisson equation is solved
everywhere except in the oxide region. Instead of carrying the potential calculation within the oxide region,
the  potential  at  the  semiconductor-oxide  interface  is  calculated  by  assuming  a  mixed  boundary  condition.
FEDAS uses FDM to solve the set of linear equations. A three-dimensional variation of FEDAS is available for
the simulation of small geometry MOSFETs.
