One of the most common mistakes made by beginning electronics students in their application
of Ohm’s Laws is mixing the contexts of voltage, current, and resistance. In other words, a
student might mistakenly use a value for I through one resistor and the value for E across a
set of interconnected resistors, thinking that they’ll arrive at the resistance of that one resistor.
Not so! Remember this important rule: The variables used in Ohm’s Law equations must be
common to the same two points in the circuit under consideration. I cannot overemphasize
this rule. This is especially important in series-parallel combination circuits where nearby
components may have different values for both voltage drop and current.
