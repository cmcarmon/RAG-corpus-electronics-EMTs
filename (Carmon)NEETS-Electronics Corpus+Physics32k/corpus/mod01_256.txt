Use the example colors shown in figure 1-31. Since red is the color of the first band, the first
significant digit is 2. The second band is violet, therefore the second significant digit is 7. The third band
is orange, which indicates that the number formed as a result of reading the first two bands is multiplied
by 1000. In this case 27  x 1000 = 27,000 ohms. The last band on the resistor indicates the tolerance; that
is, the manufacturer's allowable ohmic deviation above and below the numerical value indicated by the
resistor's color code. In this example, the color silver indicates a tolerance of 10 percent. In other words,
