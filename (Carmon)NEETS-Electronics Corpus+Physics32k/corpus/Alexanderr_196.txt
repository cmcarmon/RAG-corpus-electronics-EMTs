to the passive sign convention, the circuit in Fig. 4.35(a) is
supplying power. Of course, the resistors in Fig. 4.35(a) cannot
supply power (they absorb power); it is the dependent source
that supplies the power. This is an example of how a
dependent source and resistors could be used to simulate
negative resistance.
