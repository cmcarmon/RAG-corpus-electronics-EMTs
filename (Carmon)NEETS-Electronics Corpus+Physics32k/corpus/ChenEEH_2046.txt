Petri nets are an excellent formal model for studying concur-
rent and distributed systems and have been widely applied in
many different areas of computer science and other disciplines
(Murata, 1989). There have been over 8000 publications on
Petri nets (refer to Website http://www.daimi.au.dk/PetriNets/).
Since Carl Adam Petri originally developed Petri nets in 1962,
Petri nets have evolved through four generations: the ﬁrst-
generation low-level Petri nets primarily used for modeling
system control (Reisig, 1985a), the second-generation high-
level Petri nets for describing both system data and control
(Jensen and Rozenberg, 1991), the third-generation hierar-
chical Petri nets for abstracting system structures (He and
Lee, 1991; He, 1996; Jensen, 1992), and the fourth-generation
object-oriented Petri nets for supporting modern system de-
velopment approaches (Agha, 2001). Petri nets have also been
extended in many different ways to study speciﬁc system
properties, such as performance, reliability, and schedulability.
