Magnetic stones such as those found by the ancient Greeks are considered to be NATURAL
MAGNETS. These stones had the ability to attract small pieces of iron in a manner similar to the magnets
which are common today. However, the magnetic properties attributed to the stones were products of
nature and not the result of the efforts of man. The Greeks called these substances magnetite.
