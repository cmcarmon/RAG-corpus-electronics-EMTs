Five prototypes were built:
Aérotrain 01 was a 1/2 scale (10.11 m, 2.6 t) prototype. It was originally propelled by a three-bladed reversible-pitch propeller powered by a 260 horsepower (190 kW) aircraft engine, which was later replaced by a Turboméca Marboré jet engine. The air cushion is maintained by two 50 horsepower (37 kW) compressors. It had places for four passengers and two crew.
Aérotrain 02 (shown in picture) was another sub-scale prototype, seating two crew. It was powered by a Pratt & Whitney JT12 turbojet.
Aérotrain S44 was a full-size passenger-carrying car intended for suburban commuter service at speeds of 200 km/h (in particular links between city centres and airports). It was equipped with a Linear Induction Motor (linear motor) propulsion system supplied by Merlin-Gérin.
Aérotrain I80 was a full-size passenger-carrying car for intercity service. It was 25.6 m long, 3.2 m wide, 3.3 m high, had a mass of 11.25 t empty, and had 80 passenger seats. In its original configuration (as I80-250 for 250 km/h), it was propelled by twin Turboméca Turmo III E3 turboshaft (1,610 horsepower (1,200 kW) each) powering a ducted propeller, 2.3 m in diameter, with seven blades of variable pitch. A Turboméca Turmastazou 14 turboshaft engine powered the air compressors (six horizontal for the support and six vertical for guidance). Braking was typically provided by reverse thrust of the propeller, and in emergencies by a friction brake on the central rail. External noise was 90-95 dBA at 65 yards (59 m). I80-250 was later rebuilt for 350 km/h and re-designated as the I-80 HV (Haute Vitesse = high speed). The main change was the new propulsion system, a JT8D turbofan from Pratt & Whitney mounted on top. I-80 HV established the world speed record for overland air cushion vehicles on 5 March 1974 with a mean speed of 417.6 km/h (259.5 mph) and a peak speed of 430.4 km/h (267.4 mph).
UTACV was a prototype built by Rohr Industries for the US DOT's TACV program, built under the Bertin Aérotrain licence in the USA.
