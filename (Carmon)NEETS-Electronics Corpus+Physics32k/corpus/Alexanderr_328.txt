7.1
Now  that  we  have  considered  the  three  passive  elements  (resistors,
capacitors,  and  inductors)  and  one  active  element  (the  op  amp)  indi-
vidually, we are prepared to consider circuits that contain various com-
binations  of  two  or  three  of  the  passive  elements.  In  this  chapter,  we
shall examine two types of simple circuits: a circuit comprising a resis-
tor  and  capacitor  and  a  circuit  comprising  a  resistor  and  an  inductor.
These  are  called  RC and  RL circuits,  respectively. As  simple  as  these
circuits  are,  they  Ô¨Ånd  continual  applications  in  electronics,  communi-
cations, and control systems, as we shall see.
