As far as smart sensor technology is concerned, in fact, all the synergistic responses and effects between the
electric and nonelectric phenomena just discussed can be judiciously adopted. Considering the state-of-the-
art  technology  and  practical  considerations,  however,  the  existing  smart  sensors  are  limited  to  the  aforesaid
versions. Future trends could, however, include other possible electric to nonelectric synergistic responses.
