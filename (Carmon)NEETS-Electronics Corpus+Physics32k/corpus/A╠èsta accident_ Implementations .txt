Scanet was replaced by Global System for Mobile Communications â€“ Railway (GSM-R) in 2007. The system, delivered by Nokia Siemens Networks, was on time and on budget, and made Norway one of the first countries to fully implement the system throughout Europe. After GSM-R was fully implemented on 1 November, Scanet was gradually closed. The new system has been characterised as simpler to use and giving better audio quality than Scanet.
