Large  hydrostatic  piezoresistance  Ph  coefÔ¨Åcients  (two  orders  of  magnitude  larger  than  those  of  silicon  and
germanium)  have  been  observed  in  this  class  of  polycrystalline  semiconductors  [Sauer  et al.,  1959].  PTCR
compositions  are  synthesized  by  donor  doping  ferroelectric  barium  titanate  BaTiO3,  (Ba,Sr)TiO3,  or
(Ba,Pb)TiO3  with  a  trivalent  element  (e.g.,  yttrium)  or  a  pentavalent  element  (e.g.,  niobium).  Below  the
ferroelectric transition temperature Tc, Schottky barriers between the conductive ceramic grains are neutralized
by the spontaneous polarization Ps associated with the ferroelectric phase transition. Above Tc the barrier height
increases rapidly with temperature (hence the electrical resistivity) because of the disappearance of Ps and the
decrease of the paraelectric state dielectric constant. Analytic expressions that permit the computation of barrier
heights under different elastic and thermal boundary conditions have been developed [Amin, 1989].
