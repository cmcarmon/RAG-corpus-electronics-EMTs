forms the signature of the schema), and thus a reference of this
variable in another schema needs to be preﬁxed by its schema
name followed by a period (i.e., Name.var). A variable name can
be a simple name (deﬁning the old value), a name with a prime0
(deﬁning the new value of the same name without the prime), a
name with a question mark ? (an input from the external
environment), or a name with an exclamation point ! (an
output to the external environment). If a schema includes
both the name of a schema S and its primed version S0, the
following notation is used: DS when the value of some variable
deﬁned in S has been changed by the required processing or JS
when nothing in S is changed by the required processing.
