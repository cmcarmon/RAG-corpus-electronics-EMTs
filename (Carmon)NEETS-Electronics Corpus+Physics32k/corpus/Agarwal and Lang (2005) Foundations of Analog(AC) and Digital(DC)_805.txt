Figure 6.5b shows the linear subcircuit formed when the switch is in the ON state. We
can obtain the desired current i1a for the ON-state circuit by using the current divider
relation from Equation 2.84. The current divider relation states that when two resistors
are connected in parallel, the current through one of the resistors is equal to the total
current through the two resistors multiplied by a factor, which is made up of the opposite
resistance divided by the sum of the two resistances. Accordingly, (when the switch is
in the ON state):
