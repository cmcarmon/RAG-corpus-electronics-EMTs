Child safety locks are built into the rear doors of most cars to prevent rear seat passengers from opening the doors both during transit and while the vehicle is stationary; vehicles have been built with this feature since the early 1980s. They provide the vehicle driver with a simple, safe & secure method to prevent unauthorized exit from the car. Although called a child lock it is equally effective for adult passengers.
The lock is typically engaged via a small switch on the edge of the door that is only accessible when the door is open. Some cars implement the child lock control as a rotary mechanism which can only be operated with a key. This design ensures the child lock remains in its intended state, it is invaluable for older children or adults that may tamper with the lock when the door is open. Once the door is closed, control of these two mechanical type child locks is completely inaccessible to the passengers. In some newer models the child lock can be activated electronically from the driver position via a Door control unit, (Volvo V40 owners manual).
When the child lock is engaged, the interior handle is rendered useless, usually just moving freely without unlatching the door. In this state a passenger simply cannot open the door, nor can he or she disable the lock, and is effectively locked in. The door can only be opened by someone lifting the outside handle, either a second person or by the passenger opening the window and reaching the outside handle.
