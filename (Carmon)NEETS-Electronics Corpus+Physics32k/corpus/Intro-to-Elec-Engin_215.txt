By expressing the sinusoidal excitation as the sum of two exponentials, as in Equation
(3.1.18), the method developed to Ô¨Ånd the response to exponential excitations can easily be
extended with the principle of superposition to obtain the forced response to sinusoidal excitation,
as illustrated in the following example.
