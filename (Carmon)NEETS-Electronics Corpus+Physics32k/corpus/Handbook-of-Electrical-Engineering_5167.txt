Electro-optic Smart Materials
Typically potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP) exhibits electro-optic behavior. Synthetic materials that have
the ability to alter their refractive index (and hence the optical transmission and reï¬‚ection characteristics) in
the presence of an electric stimulus can be comprehended as viable smart sensor applications.
