Time is required for a voltage or current to change in amplitude. The interval of time needed for the 
voltage to go from 0 to 100 percent (or from 100 to 0 percent) of its maximum value is called the 
TRANSIENT INTERVAL. The two types of transient intervals are RISE TIME and FALL TIME. Rise 
time is more accurately defined as the time required for the voltage to build up from 10 percent to 90 
percent of the maximum amplitude point. Fall time is the time required for the voltage to drop from 90 
percent to 10 percent of the maximum amplitude point.
