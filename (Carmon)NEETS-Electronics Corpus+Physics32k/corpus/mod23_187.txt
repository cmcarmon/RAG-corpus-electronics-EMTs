Another job of a tape reeling system is to make sure the magnetic tape is protected from damage 
during operation. To do this, tape reeling systems use tape guides. Tape guides come in two designs, fixed 
and rotary. Both of these are shown in figure 4-6. Each type of tape guide has its drawbacks. Fixed tape 
guides produce a lot more friction, and rotary tape guides are more likely to cause errors because of their 
moving parts.
