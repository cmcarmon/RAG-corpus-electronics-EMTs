The distance relays may be further subdivided into categories depending upon the shape of their protection
characteristics. The most commonly used relays have a directional distance, or a mho characteristic. The two
characteristics are shown in Fig. 61.45. The directional impedance relay consists of two functions, a directional
detection function and a distance measurement function. The mho characteristic is inherently directional, as
the mho circle, by relay design, passes through the origin of the RX plane. Figure 61.45 also shows the multiple
zones of the step distance protection.
