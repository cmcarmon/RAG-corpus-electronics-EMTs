Another tradeoff involves the choice of FM waveform. Here the use of a triangular waveform is undesirable
because the Doppler frequency averages out and Doppler compensation is then required. Thus the sawtooth
version is chosen, but because of the large frequency deviation desired, the difÔ¨Åculty of linearizing the frequency
sweep is made greater. In fact many components must be extremely wideband, and this generally increases cost
and may adversely affect performance. On the other hand, the difference frequency (Fb) and/or the intermediate
frequency (FIF) will be higher and thus further from the carrier, so the phase noise will be lower. After discussing
the other tradeoffs, Piper chose 60 MHz for the beat frequency.
