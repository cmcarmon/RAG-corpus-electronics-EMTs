Later work showed that letting
 improves the perceived quality of the reconstructed speech
by shaping the spectrum of the quantization noise to match the speech spectrum, as well as improving noisy-
channel  performance  [Gibson,  1984].  To  produce  high-quality,  highly  intelligible  speech,  it  is  necessary  that
the quantizer and predictor parameters be adaptive to compensate for nonstationarities in the speech waveform.
