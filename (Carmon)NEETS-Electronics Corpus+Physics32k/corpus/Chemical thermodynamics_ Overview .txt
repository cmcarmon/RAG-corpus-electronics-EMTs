The primary objective of chemical thermodynamics is the establishment of a criterion for the determination of the feasibility or spontaneity of a given transformation. In this manner, chemical thermodynamics is typically used to predict the energy exchanges that occur in the following processes:
Chemical reactions
Phase changes
The formation of solutions
The following state functions are of primary concern in chemical thermodynamics:
Internal energy (U)
Enthalpy (H)
Entropy (S)
Gibbs free energy (G)
Most identities in chemical thermodynamics arise from application of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, particularly the law of conservation of energy, to these state functions.
The 3 laws of thermodynamics:
The energy of the universe is constant.
In any spontaneous process, there is always an increase in entropy of the universe
The entropy of a perfect crystal(well ordered) at 0 Kelvin is zero
