You might be wondering what trigonometry has to 
do with electronics. It’s just that a familiarity with 
some  basic 
to 
developing an understanding  of signal,  waveforms 
and  AC  circuits.  Indeed,  the  most  fundamental 
waveform used in AC circuits is the sine wave and 
this wave is a trigonometric function.  
 
Basic trigonometrical ratios 
 
Trigonometrical  ratios  are  to  do  with  the  way  in 
which we measure angles. Take a look at the right-
angled triangle shown in Fig. A8.14. This triangle 
has three sides; a, b, and c. The angle that we are 
interested in (we have used the Greek symbol 8 to 
denote  this  angle)  is  adjacent  to  side  a and  is 
opposite to side b. The third side of the triangle (the 
hypotenuse) is the longest side of the triangle.  
 
In  Fig.  A8.14,  the  theorem  of  Pythagoras  states 
that  ‘the  square  on  the  hypotenuse  is  equal  to  the 
sum of the squares on the other two sides’. Writing 
this as an equation we arrive at: 
 
c2 = a2 + b2
where c is the hypotenuse and a and b are the other 
two sides. 
  Taking square roots of both sides of the equation 
we can see that:
