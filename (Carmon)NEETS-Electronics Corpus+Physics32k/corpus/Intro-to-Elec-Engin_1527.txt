Digital transmission by FSK is a nonlinear modulation method that is appropriate for channels
that lack the phase stability needed to perform carrier-phase estimation. Figure 15.3.19 shows
the functions of a coherent FSK system in which the transmitted signal sFSK(t) is generated by
frequency modulation of a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). The digital signal d(t) has a polar
format with amplitudes ±1, corresponding to binary digits 1 and 0, respectively. Modulation keys
the VCO’s angular frequency between two values, such that
