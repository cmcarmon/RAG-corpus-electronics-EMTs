In the heat of war, radio engineering was transformed into electronics. Electronics became a technology
to  harness  the  most  advanced  and  subtle  knowledge  of  the  very  parts  of  matter  itself,  manipulating
electrons and electromagnetic waves in an effort not simply to communicate, but to detect, control, and
even as some saw it, think. The tremendous pressures of wartime development forged a new relationship
between engineers and physical scientists. More and more the realms and tasks of both overlapped and
advances in electronics made use of the latest ﬁndings, theories, and techniques of physicists and chemists,
while scientiﬁc discovery came to rely progressively more on the instrumentation created by engineers.
This merging of science and technology was one of the war’s greatest legacies and has continued to shape
our times.
