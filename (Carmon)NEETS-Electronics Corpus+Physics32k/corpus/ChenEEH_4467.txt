The feed-forward complementary ﬁlter to combine pc and
pm to estimate p is shown in Figure 4.4. In this ﬁgure, all
signals are illustrated in continuous time to clearly show the
integrals involved. Both the INS and the ﬁlter would typically
be implemented via computer in discrete-time representation.
The analysis that follows will also be performed in discrete
time. This feed-forward complementary ﬁlter implementation
has several useful features in addition to those previously
noted. First, the inputs to the ﬁlter H(s) are stationary sto-
chastic quantities unaffected by p, v, or a. In typical INS
applications, this independence is not true. Second, in the
discrete-time implementation, the INS update rate can be
much higher that the rate at which the position measurements
are made. For Kalman ﬁlter implementations, this fact signiﬁ-
cantly reduces the computational load because the time propa-
gation and measurement updates of the estimation error
covariance matrices, which are the most computationally ex-
pensive portion of the algorithm, occur at the lower rate of the
position measurement.
