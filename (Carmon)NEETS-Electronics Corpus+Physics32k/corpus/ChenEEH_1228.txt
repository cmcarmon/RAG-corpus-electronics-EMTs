The existing net ordering formulations to minimize noise
are no longer valid with presence of inductive noise, and
shield insertion is needed to minimize inductive noise (He
and Lepak, 2000). He and Lepak (2000) formulate two simul-
taneous shield insertion and net ordering (SINO) problems:
(1) the optimal SINO/NF problem to ﬁnd a min-area SINO
solution that is free of capacitive and inductive noise and
(2) the optimal SINO/NB problem to ﬁnd a min-area SINO
solution that is free of capacitive noise and is under the given
inductive noise bound. They claimed that this work was the
ﬁrst presenting an in-depth study on the simultaneous shield
insertion and net ordering problem to minimize both capaci-
tive and inductive noises. The drawbacks of this work are the
consideration for having the same wire lengths and the con-
sideration that the appropriate sensitivity matrix is given a
priori. In addition, this matrix required an overhead, and He
and Lepak (2000) did not mention the complexity or how to
build this matrix. They developed four approximate algorithms
