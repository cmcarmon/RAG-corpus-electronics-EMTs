Conclusion
The worldwide market for 1996 CRTs is at a yearly level of 50 million units compared to 38 million units in
1991 [Stanford Resources, 1992]. High resolution color CRTs are the mainstream of this growth because there
is progressive symbiosis between multimedia and high resolution color television with the upcoming of digital
television and the development of the Internet. The growth of this market is presently foreseen by the electron
tube community up to 100 million units yearly. It is now obvious that the competitive technologies have still
to progress to be able to replace the CRT in many applications and that this progress is much slower than the
sometimes optimistic predictions of the scientiÔ¨Åc and industrial community.
