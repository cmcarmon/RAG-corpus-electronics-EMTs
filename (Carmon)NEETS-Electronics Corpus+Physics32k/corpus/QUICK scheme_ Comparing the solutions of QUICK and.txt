From the below graph we can see that the QUICK scheme is more accurate than the upwind scheme. In the QUICK scheme we face the problems of undershoot and overshoot due to which some errors occur. These overshoots and undershoots should be considered while interpreting solutions. False diffusion errors will be minimized with the QUICK scheme when compared with other schemes.
