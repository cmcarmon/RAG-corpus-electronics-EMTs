A step-type voltage regulator is basically an autotransformer
with a common winding and a tapped (stepped) series
winding. A reversing switch enables the series winding to be
connected for either raising or lowering of the line voltage. The
number of steps depends on the percentage of increments in
voltage regulation desired per step. Typically, step voltage
regulators have 16 steps of 5/8% per step, for a total regulation
range of 10%.
