Hart's inversor is one of two mechanisms that provides a perfect straight line motion without sliding guides.
They were invented and published by Harry Hart in 1874â€“5.
Hart's first inversor is based on an antiparallelogram. The addition of fixed points and a driving arm make it a 6-bar linkage.
It can be used to convert rotary motion to a perfect straight line by fixing a point on one short link and driving a point on another link in a circular arc.
Hart's second inversor, also known as "Hart's A-frame", is less flexible in its dimensions, but has the useful property that the motion perpendicularly bisects the fixed base points.
