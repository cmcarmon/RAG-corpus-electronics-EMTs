been developed (IMEC, n.d.). Publications have focused on
their use to generate a single near optimal solution in the
entire search space. Their use in this new Pareto curve context
is illustrated on a binary tree predictive coder (BTPC) used
in offset image compression. Another demonstrator based
on a digital audio broadcast (DAB) receiver is discussed by
Brockmeyer et al. (1999) and Brockmeyer et al. (2000). Both
demonstrators consist of several pages of real code containing
multiple loops and arrays (in the range of 10 to 20) and a large
number of memory access instructions (100 to 200).
