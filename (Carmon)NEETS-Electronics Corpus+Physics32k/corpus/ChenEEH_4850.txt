provide a graphical user interface along with some expanded
simulation capabilities. To ease system implementation, the
Real-Time Workshop tool box can be used to generate C
code from a Simulink block diagram. Mathworks has a con-
tinuing effort to increase the efÔ¨Åciency of code generation to
improve the speed of processing and to reduce the size of
the compiled program (an important feature for embedded
processors).
