Drawbar horsepower (dbhp) is the power a railway locomotive has available to haul a train or an agricultural tractor to pull an implement. This is a measured figure rather than a calculated one. A special railway car called a dynamometer car coupled behind the locomotive keeps a continuous record of the drawbar pull exerted, and the speed. From these, the power generated can be calculated. To determine the maximum power available, a controllable load is required; it is normally a second locomotive with its brakes applied, in addition to a static load.
If the drawbar force (



F


{\displaystyle F}
) is measured in pounds-force (lbf) and speed (



v


{\displaystyle v}
) is measured in miles per hour (mph), then the drawbar power (



P


{\displaystyle P}
) in horsepower (hp) is:

{\displaystyle P/{\rm {hp}}={(F/{\rm {lbf}})(v/{\rm {mph}}) \over 375}}

Example: How much power is needed to pull a drawbar load of 2,025 pounds-force at 5 miles per hour?

{\displaystyle P/{\rm {hp}}={{2025\times 5} \over 375}=27}

The constant 375 is because 1 hp = 375 lbf⋅mph. If other units are used, the constant is different. When using coherent SI units (watts, newtons, and metres per second), no constant is needed, and the formula becomes

This formula may also be used to calculate the horsepower of a jet engine, using the speed of the jet and the thrust required to maintain that speed.
Example: How much power is generated with a thrust of 4,000 pounds at 400 miles per hour?
