Material Dispersion
In material dispersion, the velocity variation is caused by some property of the medium. In glass, it is caused
by the wavelength dependence of refractive index. For a given pulse, the resulting pulse spread per unit length
is the difference between the travel times of the slowest and fastest wavelengths in the pulse. It is given by
