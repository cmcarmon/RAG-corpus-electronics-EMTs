or  
 
C = 10 × 1049 F = 10 nF 
 
In  practice,  any  value  equal  or  less  than  10  nF 
would  be  adequate.  A  very  small  value  (say  less 
than 1 nF) will, however, generate pulses of a very 
narrow width. 
 
Example 3.14 
 
A circuit  is  required  to  produce  a  triangular 
waveform from a square wave of frequency 1 kHz. 
Devise  a  suitable  C–R  arrangement  and  specify 
suitable values. 
 
Solution 
 
This time we require an integrating circuit like that 
shown in Fig. 3.33. In order that the circuit operates 
effectively  as  an  integrator,  we  need  to  make  the 
time  constant,  C × R, very  much  less  than  the 
periodic time of the input waveform (1 ms).    
  Assuming that we choose a medium value for R
of, say, 10 kF, the minimum value which we could 
allow  C to  have  would  be  that  which  satisfies  the 
equation: 
 
C × R = 10 t 
 
where R = l0 kF and t = 1 ms. Thus
