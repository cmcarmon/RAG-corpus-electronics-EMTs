The partial differentiation of the displacement vector with respect to the material coordinates yields the material displacement gradient tensor ∇XU. Thus we have:

where F is the deformation gradient tensor.
Similarly, the partial differentiation of the displacement vector with respect to the spatial coordinates yields the spatial displacement gradient tensor ∇xU. Thus we have,
