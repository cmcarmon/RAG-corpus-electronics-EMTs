Reflections were contained in the speech about the responsibilities owed by industry participants to vulnerable road accident victims -

"The roles performed in the accident towing industry are positions of considerable responsibility and the safety, trust and convenience of those involved in road accidents are imperative. The probity check will, for example, help to protect crash victims who are in a vulnerable state and who may get a lift home in a tow truck from the unacceptable risk of falling prey to a driver who has previously committed a serious criminal offence. It will also help protect accident victims from having their motor vehicle or possessions being mistreated at the depot by operators or depot managers."
