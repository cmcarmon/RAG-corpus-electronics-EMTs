such as Fortran, rapid random-access storage of large arrays of
numbers, and computational speeds that were orders of mag-
nitude faster than possible with mechanical calculators. In this
period, the principal computational approaches for Maxwellâ€™s
equations included the high-frequency asymptotic methods of
Keller (1962) as well as Kouyoumjian and Pathak (1974) and
the integral equation techniques of Harrington (1968).
