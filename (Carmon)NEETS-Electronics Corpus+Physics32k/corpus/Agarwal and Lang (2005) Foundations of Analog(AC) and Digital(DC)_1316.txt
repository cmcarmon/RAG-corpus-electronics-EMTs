4. u(t) and δ(t) are commonly used to represent the unit step function and the unit impulse function,
respectively. Sometimes, the following notation is also used: u0(t) to represent a unit impulse at
time t = 0. The notation un(t) is used to represent the function that results from differentiating the
impulse n times, and the notation u−n(t) represents the function that results from integrating the
impulse n times. Thus u−1(t) represents the unit step at time t = 0, u−2(t) the ramp, and u1(t)
the doublet at time t = 0.
