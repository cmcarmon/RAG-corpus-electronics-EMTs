Now that the right value for R has been calculated, we’re still left with a problem of meter
range. On the left side of the scale we have ”inﬁnity” and on the right side we have zero.
Besides being ”backwards” from the scales of voltmeters and ammeters, this scale is strange
because it goes from nothing to everything, rather than from nothing to a ﬁnite value (such as
10 volts, 1 amp, etc.). One might pause to wonder, ”what does middle-of-scale represent? What
ﬁgure lies exactly between zero and inﬁnity?” Inﬁnity is more than just a very big amount:
it is an incalculable quantity, larger than any deﬁnite number ever could be. If half-scale
indication on any other type of meter represents 1/2 of the full-scale range value, then what is
half of inﬁnity on an ohmmeter scale?
