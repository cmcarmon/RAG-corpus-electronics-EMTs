Such a procedure, namely a relaxation scheme, wherein one
integrates each of the component differential equations by
separately iterating through the connection equations to
obtain the solution of the overall system, was implemented
over 30 years ago at the Marshall Space Flight Center (Prasad
and Reiss, 1970; Trauboth and Prasad, 1970; Saeks, 1969). The
feasibility of the scheme was veriﬁed, and signiﬁcant computer
memory savings resulted. The key to this approach of the
numerical analysis of a large-scale system is that numerical
routines are applied to the decoupled composite component
differential equations rather than an overall equation for the
entire system. Thus, the complexity of the numerical compu-
tations is determined by the complexity of the largest compo-
nent in the system. In contrast, if the numerical procedures are
applied directly to a set of differential equations characterizing
the entire system, the complexity of the numerical computa-
tions is determined by the complexity of the entire system (the
sum of the complexities of all the components).
