where  the  subscripts  in  Eq. (74.11a)  refer  to  transmit  (t)  and  receive  (r).  Lower  case  terms  are  the  actual
quantities in watts, meters, etc. and the capitalized terms in Eq. (74.11b) correspond to the decibel (dB) versions
of the parenthesized quantities in Eq. (74.11a). For example, EIRP = P + G = 101logp + 101logg decibels relative
to 1 W (dBW) and the expression (C/N) should be interpreted as 10logc â€“ 10logn. The uplink and downlink
equations have identical form with the appropriate quantities substituted in Eq. (74.11). The relevant quantities
are described below.
