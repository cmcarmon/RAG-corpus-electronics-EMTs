Three basic types of LC oscillators are the Hartley	
oscillator, the colpitts	oscillator, and the clapp	
oscillator. Figure 39-2 and Figure 39-3 show the two 
basic types of Hartley oscillator. The tapped inductor 
in the tank circuit identifies these circuits as Hartley  
oscillators. The disadvantage of the series-fed		Hartley	
oscillator (Figure 39-2) is that DC  current flows 
through a portion of the tank circuit. The  shunt-fed	
Hartley	 oscillator (Figure 39-3)  overcomes the 
 problem of DC current in the tank  circuit by using a 
coupling capacitor in the feedback line.
