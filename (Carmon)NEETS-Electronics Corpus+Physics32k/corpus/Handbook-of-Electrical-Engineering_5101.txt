unidirectional TE-TM mode converter type, the common point is the conversion or coupling process between
the  TE  and  TM  modes  of  the  waveguide.  Although  very  good  results  have  been  obtained  in  some  speciÔ¨Åc
characteristics, for example, 60-dB isolation [Wolfe et al., 1990], the waveguide optical isolator is still very much
in the research and development stage.
