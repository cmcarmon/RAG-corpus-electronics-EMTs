An important point to remember when dealing with multi-unit tubes is that each unit is capable of
operating as a separate tube. But, how it operates, either as a single tube or as a multi-unit tube, is
determined by the external circuit wiring. When you analyze the schematic of a circuit, simply treat each
portion of a multi-unit tube as a single tube, as shown in figure 2-2.
