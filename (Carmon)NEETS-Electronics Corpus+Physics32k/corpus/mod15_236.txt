A SYNCHRO ROTOR is composed of either a single coil of wire wound on a laminated core or a 
group of coils wound in slots in a laminated core. The laminated core is rigidly mounted on a shaft that is 
free to turn inside the stator. Two slip rings are mounted on one end of the shaft to supply excitation 
voltage to the rotor. There are two common types of synchro rotors - the salient-pole rotor and the drum 
or wound rotor.
