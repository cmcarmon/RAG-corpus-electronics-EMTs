The law of the completeness of the parts of the system
Any working system must have 4 parts: the engine, the transmission, the working unit (working organ) and the control element (organ of steering). The engine generates the needed energy, the transmission guides this energy to the working unit, which ensures contact with outside world (processed object), and the control element makes the system adaptable.
The law of energy conductivity of the system
As every technical system is a transformer of energy, this energy should circulate freely and efficiently through its 4 main parts (engine, transmission, working element and control element). The transfer of energy can be by substance, field, or substance-field.
The law of harmonizing the rhythms of parts of the system
The frequencies of vibration, or the periodicity of parts and movements of the system should be in synchronization with each other.
