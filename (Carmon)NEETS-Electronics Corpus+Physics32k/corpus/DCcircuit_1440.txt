Therefore, a transient circuit’s time constant will be dependent upon the resistance of the
circuit. Of course, it is also dependent upon the size (storage capacity) of the reactive compo-
nent, but since the relationship of resistance to time constant is the issue of this section, we’ll
focus on the effects of resistance alone. A circuit’s time constant will be less (faster discharging
rate) if the resistance value is such that it maximizes power dissipation (rate of energy trans-
fer into heat). For a capacitive circuit where stored energy manifests itself in the form of a
voltage, this means the resistor must have a low resistance value so as to maximize current
for any given amount of voltage (given voltage times high current equals high power). For
an inductive circuit where stored energy manifests itself in the form of a current, this means
the resistor must have a high resistance value so as to maximize voltage drop for any given
amount of current (given current times high voltage equals high power).
