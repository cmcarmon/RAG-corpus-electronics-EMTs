Should you care about soldering when you plan to use solderless bread-
boards for your circuit construction projects? The answer is yes. Almost 
every electronics project involves a certain amount of soldering. For 
instance, you may purchase components (such as potentiometers, switches, 
and microphones) that don’t come with leads — in which case, you have to 
solder two or more wires to their terminals to create leads so you can con-
nect them to your breadboard.
