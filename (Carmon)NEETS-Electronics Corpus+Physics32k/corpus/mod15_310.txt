Figure 3-4 is another view of the same gyroscope. Its far end is still balanced on the pivot. Gravity is 
pulling down on the gyro. If the gyro rotor is turning in the direction shown by the arrow, the near end of 
the frame (axis) will move to the left. If the rotor were turning in the opposite direction, the frame would 
move to the right. Note that in each of these examples the direction of movement was displaced from the 
applied force (gravity) by 90ยบ. The axis stays horizontal, but the gyroscope responds to the force of 
gravity by rotating around the pivot.
