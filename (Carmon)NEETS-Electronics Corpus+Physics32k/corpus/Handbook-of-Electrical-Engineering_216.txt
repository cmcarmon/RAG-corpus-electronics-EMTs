What Are Controlled Sources?
By source we mean a voltage or current source in the usual sense. By controlled we mean that the strength of
such a source is controlled by some circuit variable(s) elsewhere in the circuit. Figure 2.10 illustrates a simple
circuit  containing  an  (independent)  current  source,  is ,  two  resistors,  and  a  controlled  voltage  source,  whose
magnitude is controlled by the current i1. Thus, i1 determines two voltages in the circuit, the voltage across R1
via Ohm’s law and the controlled voltage source via some unspeciﬁed effect.
