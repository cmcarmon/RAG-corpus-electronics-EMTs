When nearly full speed is obtained, a centrifugal device (the starting switch) cuts out the starting
winding. The motor then runs as a plain single-phase induction motor. Since the auxiliary winding is only
a light winding, the motor does not develop sufficient torque to start heavy loads. Split-phase motors,
therefore, come only in small sizes.
