 Figure 2-10(C) shows that when switch S2 is closed (source voltage ES removed from the circuit), the 
flux that has been established around the inductor (L) collapses through the windings. This induces a 
voltage eL in the inductor that has a polarity opposite to ES and is essentially equal to ES in magnitude. 
The induced voltage causes decay current (id) to flow in resistor R in the same direction in which current 
was flowing originally (when S1 was closed). A voltage (eR) that is initially equal to source voltage (ES) is 
developed across R. The voltage across the resistor (eR) rapidly falls to zero as the voltage across the 
inductor (eL) falls to zero due to the collapsing flux.
