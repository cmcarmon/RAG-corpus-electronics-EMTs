Magnetostrictive Smart Materials
Materials with a high degree of magnetostriction are deployed in modern intelligent structures. Typically, the
amount of strain inducible with intelligent materials in the current state of the art is 2000 ppm. These are alloys
made  with  iron  and  rare  earth  materials  such  as  terbium  (Te),  dysprosium  (Dy),  and  niobium  (Nb).  A
commercially known material of this category is Terfenol [Reed, 1988]. Magnetostrictive transducers for smart
applications have also been developed with a certain class of metallic glass materials.
