Two very important two-ports are the T and 
 networks shown in Fig. 9.1. Because we encounter these two
geometrical forms often in two-port analyses, it is useful to determine the conditions under which these two
-parameter
networks  are  equivalent.  In  order  to  determine  the  equivalence  relationship,  we  will  examine 
equations for the T network and the
