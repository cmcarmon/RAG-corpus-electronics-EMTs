DIPs are designed to be through‐hole mounted onto a printed circuit board 
(PCB), with the pins extending through holes in the board and soldered on 
the other side. You can solder DIP pins directly onto a circuit board or use 
sockets designed to hold the chip without bending the pins. You solder the 
socket connections into your circuit, and then insert the chip into the socket. 
DIPs also fit nicely into the contact holes of solderless breadboards (which I 
cover in Chapter 15), making it easy to prototype a circuit.
