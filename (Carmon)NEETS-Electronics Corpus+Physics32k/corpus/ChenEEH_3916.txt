3. The equivalence of ^ssMAP to ^ssms(x) is not restricted
to the case of Gaussian a posteriori pdf. In fact, if the
cost function is symmetric and nondecreasing and if
the a posteriori pdf is symmetric and unimodal and
satisﬁes lims!1 J (s, x)fSjX (sjx) ¼ 0, then the resulting
Bayesian estimation (e.g., MAP estimate) is equivalent
to ^ssMS(x).
