Aircraft design standards specify a maximum amount of Pitot-static system error. The error in indicated altitude must not be excessive because it is important for pilots to know their altitude with reasonable accuracy for the purpose of traffic separation. US Federal Aviation Regulations, Part 23, §23.1325(e) includes the following requirement for the static pressure system:
The system error, in indicated pressure altitude, ..., may not exceed ±30 feet per 100 knot speed for the [operating speed range for the aircraft].
The error in indicated airspeed must also not be excessive. Part 23, §23.1323(b) includes the following requirement for the airspeed indicating system:
The system error, including position error, ..., may not exceed three percent of the calibrated airspeed or five knots, whichever is greater, throughout the [operating speed range for the aircraft].
