The first single was "They Prefer Blondes" bw "Take a Ride with Me". The second was "Never Said I Loved You" / "So Hard to Bear. Both singles were released on the SOLO label. Later with Kensington Forest which was a Banshees incarnation of sorts, he produced another single called "Movinâ€™ On" bw "Bells". This was released on the Bay Sound label in 1967.
