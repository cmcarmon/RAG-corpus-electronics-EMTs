To  introduce  the  context  and  use  of  controlled  sources  we  will  consider  a  circuit  model  for  the  bipolar
junction transistor (BJT). In Fig. 2.11 we show the standard symbol for an npn BJT with base (B), emitter (E),
and collector (C) identiﬁed, and voltage and current variables deﬁned. We have shown the common emitter
conﬁguration,  with  the  emitter  terminal  shared  to  make  input  and  output  terminals.  The  base  current,  iB ,
ideally depends upon the base-emitter voltage, vBE , by the relationship
