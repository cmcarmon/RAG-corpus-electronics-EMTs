where k is the ﬂuid thermal conductivity, l the length (in the ﬂow direction) of the surface, Re the Reynolds
number (equal to the product of velocity, density, and length divided by the ﬂuid viscosity), and Pr the Prandtl
number (equal to the product of speciﬁc heat and viscosity divided by the thermal conductivity of the ﬂuid).
Inserting  the  various  parameters  associated  with  the  Re  and  Pr  in  Eq.  (33.16),  the  laminar  heat  transfer
coefﬁcient is found to be directly proportional to the square root of ﬂuid velocity and inversely proportional
to the square root of the length. Furthermore, increases in the thermal conductivity of the ﬂuid and in the Pr,
as  are  encountered  in  replacing  air  with  a  liquid  coolant,  can  be  expected  to  result  in  higher  heat  transfer
coefﬁcients.  In  studies  of  low-velocity  convective  air  cooling  of  simulated  integrated  circuit  packages,  h  has
been  found  to  depend  somewhat  more  strongly  on  Re  than  suggested  in  Eq.  (33.16),  and  to  display  an  Re
exponent of 0.54-0.72 [Buller and Kilburn, 1981; Sparrow et al., 1982; Wirtz and Dykshoorn, 1984].
