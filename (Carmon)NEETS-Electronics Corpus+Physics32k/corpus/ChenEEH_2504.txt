in which ZL and Zi are in general complex quantities. The Z0
represents the characteristic impedance of the stub line or the
main transmission line that, for a microstrip line, can be
calculated at low frequency by knowing the line width, the
substrate thickness, and the dielectric constant. Calculating Z0
of a waveguide also requires knowledge of the frequency be-
cause waveguides are very dispersive (frequency dependent).
Equation 7.2 clearly illustrates the important fact that imped-
ance transformation on a transmission line is only possible if
the line is mismatched (Z0 6Â¼ ZL). Examples of short-circuited
and open-ended transmission lines with an electrical length
smaller than l=4 are shown in Figure 7.4. Also shown is their
possible realization in a microstrip circuit as well as the equiva-
lent network.
