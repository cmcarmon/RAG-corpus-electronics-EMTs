In Chapters 3 through 12, you find out how these  different 
electronic components manipulate current and work together to 
make useful things happen. Most of those chapters include simple experi-
ments designed to show you firsthand what each component can do. 
Chapter 17 contains more involved projects, each of which involves many 
components working together as a team to make something useful (or just 
fun) happen. In this chapter, you find out what you need to build these 
 experimental circuits and projects.
