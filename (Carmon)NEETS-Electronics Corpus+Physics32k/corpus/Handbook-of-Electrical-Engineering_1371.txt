This presentation is organized as follows. In the second section the speech enhancement problem is formu-
lated and commonly used models and performance measures are presented. In the next section signal estimation
for improving perceptual aspects of the noisy signal is discussed. In the fourth section source coding techniques
for noisy signals are summarized, and the last section deals with recognition of noisy speech signals. Due to
the  limited  number  of  references  (10)  allowed  in  this  publication,  tutorial  papers  are  mainly  referenced.
Appropriate credit will be given by pointing to the tutorial papers which reference the original papers.
