 
4.17  The graph shown in Fig. 4.31 was obtained 
during  measurements  on  a  high-Q  filter. 
 
Determine the following parameters for the 
 
filter: 
 
(a)  resonant frequency 
 
 
(b) bandwidth 
(c) Q-factor. 
 
4.18   The circuit shown in Fig. 4.32 is fed from a  
2  V  constant  voltage  source.  At  what 
 
 
frequency  will  the  supply  current  be  a 
minimum  and  what  will  the  current  be  at 
 
this  frequency?  What  current  will  flow  in 
 
the inductor and capacitor at this frequency? 
 
Identify the component shown in Fig. 4.33. 
4.19 
 
Explain  how  this  component  operates  and 
state a typical application for it.
