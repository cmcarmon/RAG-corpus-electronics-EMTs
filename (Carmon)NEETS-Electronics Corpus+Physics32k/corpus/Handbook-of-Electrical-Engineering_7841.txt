Recording by Magnetic Field Modulation
Another method of thermomagnetic recording is based on magnetic ﬁeld modulation (MFM) and is depicted
schematically in Fig. 80.31(a). Here the laser power may be kept constant while the information signal is used
to modulate the magnetic ﬁeld. Photomicrographs of typical domain patterns recorded in the MFM scheme
are  shown  in  Fig. 80.31(b).  Crescent-shaped  domains  are  the  hallmark  of  the  ﬁeld  modulation  technique.  If
one assumes (using a much simpliﬁed model) that the magnetization aligns itself with the applied ﬁeld within
