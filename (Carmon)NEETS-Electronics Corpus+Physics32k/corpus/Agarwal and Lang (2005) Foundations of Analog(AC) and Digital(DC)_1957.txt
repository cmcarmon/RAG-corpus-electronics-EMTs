but increases with increasing frequency. This effect is readily observable if one
tries to build a 2:1 divider at the input of an oscilloscope by using two one-
megohm resistors for R1 and R2. (Such a divider circuit might be used in a
scope probe, for example.) Two problems will arise. The input resistance of
the scope will change the desired attenuation at low frequencies, and the scope
input capacitance will cause the attenuation to change with frequency, as can
be seen from Equation 13.120.
