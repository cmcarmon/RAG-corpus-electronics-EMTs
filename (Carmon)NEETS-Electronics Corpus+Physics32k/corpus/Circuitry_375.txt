where  RE is  the  value  of  collector  or  drain  load 
resistance. 
  Figure 7.36 shows a load line superimposed on a 
set of output characteristics for a bipolar transistor 
operating in common-emitter mode. The quiescent 
point  (or  operating  point)  is  the  point  on  the  load 
line  that  corresponds  to  the  conditions  that  exist 
when no-signal is applied to the stage. In Fig. 7.36, 
the  base  bias  current  is  set  at  20  ÂµA  so  that  the 
quiescent  point  effectively  sits  roughly  halfway 
along  the  load  line.  This  position  ensures  that  the 
collector voltage can swing both positively (above) 
and negatively (below) its quiescent value (VCQ).
