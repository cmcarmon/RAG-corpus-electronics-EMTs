Next, let us consider heat ï¬‚ow from an enclosure with a heating system to the outside of
the enclosure, depending upon the temperature difference T between the inside and outside of
the enclosure. The heat capacity of the enclosure is analogous to capacitance, in the sense that
the enclosure retains part of the heat produced by the heating system. One can then infer the
analogy between electrical and thermal systems given in Table 1.5.3.
