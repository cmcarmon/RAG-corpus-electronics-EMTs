Introduction
Many times we want to model the behavior of an electric network at only
two terminals as shown in Fig. 3.49. Here, only V1 and I1, not voltages and
currents internal to the circuit, need to be described. To produce the model
for a linear circuit, we use Thévenin’s or Norton’s theorem to simplify the
network as viewed from the selected terminals. We deﬁne the pair of termi-
nals shown in Fig. 3.49 as a port, where the current, I1, entering one terminal
equals the current leaving the other terminal.
