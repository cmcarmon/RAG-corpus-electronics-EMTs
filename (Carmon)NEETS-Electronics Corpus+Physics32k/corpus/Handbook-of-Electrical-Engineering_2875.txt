The ﬂuxes are an integral part of the solder paste, and are discussed further in Section 26.11. RMA, water
soluble,  and  no-clean  ﬂux/pastes  are  available.  An  issue  directly  related  to  ﬂuxes,  cleaning  and  ﬁne-pitch
components (25 mil pitch and less) is reﬂowing in an inert environment. Inert gas blanketing the oven markedly
reduces the development of oxides in the elevated temperatures present. Oxide reduction needs are greater with
the smaller metal balls in paste designed for ﬁne-pitch parts because there is more surface area on which oxides
can form. No-clean ﬂuxes are not as active as other ﬂuxes and therefore have a lesser ability to reduce the oxides
formed on both the paste metal and substrate metallizations. Inerting the oven tends to solve these problems.
However, it brings with it control issues that must be considered.
