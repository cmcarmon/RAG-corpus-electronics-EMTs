The cost to clean up after an asteroid or comet impact would cost billions to trillions of dollars, depending on the location impacted. An impact in New York City (the 16th most populated city in the world) could cost billions of dollars in financial losses, and it could take years for the financial sector (i.e. stock market) to recover. However, the probability of such a naturally specifically aimed impact would be exceedingly low.
