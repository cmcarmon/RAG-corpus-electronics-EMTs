Hand tools should always be kept clean, in good 
working condition, and free of rust. Using or storing 
the tools in a damp environment creates rust. The for-
mation of rust can be prevented or kept to a minimum 
by occasionally spraying tools with an oil product or 
wiping tools with an oily rag. When rust does form, 
it can be removed easily with fine steel wool or a fine 
abrasive.
