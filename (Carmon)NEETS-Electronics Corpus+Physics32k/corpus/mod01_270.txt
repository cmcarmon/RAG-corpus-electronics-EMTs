In equipment such as the Navyâ€™s complex computers, the reliability level is very significant. For
example, in a piece of equipment containing 10,000 orange fifth-band resistors, no more than one resistor
will fail during 1,000 hours of operation. This is very good reliability. More information on resistors is
contained in NEETS Module 19.
