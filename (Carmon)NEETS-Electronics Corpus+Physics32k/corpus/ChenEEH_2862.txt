Noise is the chief limiting factor of the sensitivity of a receiver.
If the receiver itself were perfect and did not generate any
excess noise, there would still exist noise generated by the
thermal motion of the conduction electrons. This noise is
called thermal noise. The thermal noise power is proportional
to the temperature T (degrees Kelvin) and the receiver band-
width Bn (hertz) and is given by:
