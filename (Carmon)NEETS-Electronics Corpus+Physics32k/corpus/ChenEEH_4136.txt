When GMSK was Ô¨Årst proposed (Murota and Hirade, 1981),
the modulator was based on using frequency modulation
(FM), illustrated by Figure 4.12. Since newer integrated circuits
are available that enable an I and Q modulator to be easily
constructed, a more modern method to generate the GSMK
signal is shown in Figure 4.13.
