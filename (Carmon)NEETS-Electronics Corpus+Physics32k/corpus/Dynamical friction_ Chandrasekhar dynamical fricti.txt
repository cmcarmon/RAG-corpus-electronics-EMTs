The full Chandrasekhar dynamical friction formula for the change in velocity of the object involves integrating over the phase space density of the field of matter and is far from transparent. The Chandrasekhar dynamical friction formula reads as

where




G


{\displaystyle G}
is the gravitational constant




M


{\displaystyle M}
is the mass under consideration




m


{\displaystyle m}
is the mass of each star in the star distribution






v

M





{\displaystyle {v_{M}}}
is the velocity of the object under consideration, in a frame where the center of gravity of the matter field is initially at rest






Ln


(
Λ
)


{\displaystyle {\mbox{Ln}}(\Lambda )}
