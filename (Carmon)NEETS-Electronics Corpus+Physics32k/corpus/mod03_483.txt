Figure 3-9(B) is an illustration of the entire switch and its schematic symbol. Since the switch has
two wafers mechanically connected by the shaft of the switch, the shaft rotates the movable portion of
both wafers at the same time. This is represented on the schematic symbol by the dotted line connecting
the two wafers.
