Figure 3-25 shows the basic method we use to convert a frequency-shift rf signal into a signal that 
controls the dc loop of a tty. The frequency shifts of the af output from the receiver are converted into dc 
pulses by the af discriminator. The dc pulses are then fed into the keyer. The keyer opens and closes the 
dc loop of the tty according to the mark and space characters received.
