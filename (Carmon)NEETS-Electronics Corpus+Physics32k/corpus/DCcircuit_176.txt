This is just one example of ”nonlinearity” in electric circuits. It is by no means the only
example. A ”linear” function in mathematics is one that tracks a straight line when plotted on
a graph. The simpliﬁed version of the lamp circuit with a constant ﬁlament resistance of 3 Ω
generates a plot like this:
