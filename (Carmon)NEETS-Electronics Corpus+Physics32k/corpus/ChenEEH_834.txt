Plenty of good literature is available on digital hardware
description languages, especially on VHDL, and on synthesis
algorithms that exploit such languages as a means for specify-
ing the functionality of digital components and systems.
Continuous
time modeling, however, and mixed-signal
or multinature modeling are not yet covered sufﬁciently. In
Cellier (1991), the reader will ﬁnd a comprehensive discussion
of this domain. An introduction to underlying numerical
