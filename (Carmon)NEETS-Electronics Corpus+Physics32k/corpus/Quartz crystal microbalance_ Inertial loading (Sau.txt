The frequency shift induced by a thin sample which is rigidly coupled to the crystal (such as a thin film), is described by the Sauerbrey equation. The stress is governed by inertia, which implies σ = -ω2u0mF, where u0 is the amplitude of oscillation and mF is the (average) mass per unit area. Inserting this result into the small-load-approximation one finds

{\displaystyle {\frac {\Delta f^{*}}{f_{f}}}\approx {\frac {i}{\pi Z_{q}}}{\frac {-\omega ^{2}u_{0}m_{\%\mathrm {F} }}{i\omega u_{0}}}=-{\frac {2\,f}{Z_{q}}}m_{\mathrm {F} }}

If the density of the film is known, one can convert from mass per unit area, mF, to thickness, dF. The thickness thus derived is also called the Sauerbrey thickness to show that it was derived by applying the Sauerbrey equation to the frequency shift. The shift in bandwidth is zero if the Sauerbrey equation holds. Checking for the bandwidth therefore amounts to checking the applicability of the Sauerbrey equation.
The Sauerbrey equation was first derived by G. Sauerbrey in 1959 and correlates changes in the oscillation frequency of a piezoelectric crystal with mass deposited on it. He simultaneously developed a method for measuring the resonance frequency and its changes by using the crystal as the frequency-determining component of an oscillator circuit. His method continues to be used as the primary tool in quartz crystal microbalance experiments for conversion of frequency to mass.
Because the film is treated as an extension of thickness, Sauerbrey’s equation only applies to systems in which (a) the deposited mass has the same acoustic properties as the crystal and (b) the frequency change is small (Δf / f < 0.05).
If the change in frequency is greater than 5%, that is, Δf / f > 0.05, the Z-match method must be used to determine the change in mass. The formula for the Z-match method is:

kF is the wave vector inside the film and dF its thickness. Inserting kF = 2·π·f /cF = 2·π·f·ρF / ZF as well as dF = mF / ρF yields
