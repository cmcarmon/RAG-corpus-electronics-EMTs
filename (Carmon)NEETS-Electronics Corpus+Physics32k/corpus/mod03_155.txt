move. The movement of the plates is opposed by a spring attached to the plates. A pointer that indicates
the value of the voltage is attached to these movable plates. As the voltage increases, the plates develop
more torque. To develop sufficient torque, the plates must be large and closely spaced. A very high
voltage is necessary to provide movement, therefore, electrostatic voltmeters are used only for HIGH
VOLTAGE measurement.
