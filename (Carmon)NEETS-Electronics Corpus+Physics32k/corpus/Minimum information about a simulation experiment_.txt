All information necessary to obtain the desired numerical results must be provided.
All post-processing steps applied on the raw numerical results of simulation steps in order to generate the final results have to be described in detail. That includes the identification of data to process, the order in which changes were applied, and also the nature of changes.
If the expected insights depend on the relation between different results, such as a plot of one against another, the results to be compared have to be specified.
