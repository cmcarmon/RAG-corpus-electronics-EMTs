The Thévenin resistance seen by the inductor for t > 0 is found by considering the circuit for
t > 0 while setting all ideal sources to zero, as shown in Figure E3.2.3(b).
The time constant of the inductor current is τ = L/RTh = 5/10 = 0.5 s. The steady-
state value of the inductor current for t > 0, iL,ss(t ), is found by replacing the inductor by
a short circuit (since the sources are both dc) in the circuit for t > 0, as shown in Figure
E3.2.3(c).
