Now look at the input signal from the transformer secondary. For ease of explanation, we will
consider only three points of the ac sine wave input: point b, the maximum negative excursion; point c,
the maximum positive excursion; and point d, the zero reference or null point of the signal. At time b, the
input signal at the grid will be at its most negative value (-3 volts). This will cause the grid to go to -9
volts (-6 volts + -3 volts). This is shown at time b on the grid voltage waveform. The increased negative
voltage on the control grid will decrease the electrostatic attraction between the plate and the cathode.
Conduction through the tube (Ip) will decrease. Assume that it drops to .5 milliamperes.
