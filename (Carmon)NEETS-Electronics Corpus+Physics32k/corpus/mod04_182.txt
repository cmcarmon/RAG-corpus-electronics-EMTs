The properties of a solder joint are different from those of the original solder. The solder is converted 
to a new and different alloy through the solvent action. Two metals soldered together behave like one 
solid metal. It is unlike two metals bolted, wired, or otherwise physically attached. These types of 
connections are still two pieces of metal. They are not even in direct contact due to an insulating film of 
oxide on the surfaces of the metals.
