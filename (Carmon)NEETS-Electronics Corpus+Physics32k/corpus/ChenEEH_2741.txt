Here, for the Courant factor ﬁxed at S ¼ 0:5, three different
grid sampling densities Nl are examined: Nl ¼ 5 points per
l0, Nl ¼ 10, and Nl ¼ 20. We see that ~vvp < c and is a func-
tion of both f and Nl. The ~vvp is maximum for waves propa-
gating obliquely within the grid (f ¼ 45) and is minimum
for waves propagating along either grid axis (f ¼ 0, 90).
