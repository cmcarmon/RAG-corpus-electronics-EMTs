f o l l o w e r c i r c u i t Let us derive the valid operating ranges for the source
follower circuit shown earlier in Figure 7.24, and repeated here in Figure 7.39 for
convenience. Assume that VS = 10 V.
Recall that the valid input voltage range is defined as the range of input voltages for
which the MOSFET operates under the saturation discipline. Two conditions must be
met for the MOSFET to remain in saturation:
