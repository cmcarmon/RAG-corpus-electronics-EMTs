Each LCR circuit responds to resonant frequency differently than it does to any other frequency. 
Because of this, an LCR circuit has the ability to separate frequencies. For example, suppose the TV or 
radio station you want to see or hear is broadcasting at the resonant frequency. The LC "tuner" in your set 
can divide the frequencies, picking out the resonant frequency and rejecting the other frequencies. Thus, 
the tuner selects the station you want and rejects all other stations. If you decide to select another station, 
you can change the frequency by tuning the resonant circuit to the desired frequency.
