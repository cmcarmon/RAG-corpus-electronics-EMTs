Once we deﬁne current as the movement of charge, we expect cur-
rent to have an associated direction of ﬂow. As mentioned earlier, the
direction of current ﬂow is conventionally taken as the direction of pos-
itive charge movement. Based on this convention, a current of 5 A may
be  represented  positively  or  negatively  as  shown  in  Fig.  1.5.  In  other
A ﬂowing  in  one  direction  as  shown
words,  a  negative  current  of 
in Fig. 1.5(b) is the same as a current of 
A ﬂowing in the opposite
direction.
