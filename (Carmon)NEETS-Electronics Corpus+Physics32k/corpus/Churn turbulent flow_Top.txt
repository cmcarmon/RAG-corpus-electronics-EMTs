Churn turbulent flow is a two-phase gas/liquid flow regime characterized by a highly-agitated flow where gas bubbles are sufficient in numbers to both interact with each other and, while interacting, coalesce to form larger distorted bubbles with unique shapes and behaviors in the system. This flow regime is created when there is a large gas fraction in a system with a high gas and low liquid velocity. It is an important flow regime to understand and model because of its predictive value in nuclear reactor vessel boiling flow.
