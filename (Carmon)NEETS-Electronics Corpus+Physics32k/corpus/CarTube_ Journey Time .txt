CarTube would permit direct travel without interchanging, replacing the stop-start model of current transportation with a fluid, and integrated network. The primary network, controlled by the system, will flow at a steady speed of 50 mph.
According to PLPâ€™s research, CarTube will typically double transport capacity for the same investment as conventional mass transport and reduce travel time by 75%. A journey from Heathrow from the City will take 16 minutes.
