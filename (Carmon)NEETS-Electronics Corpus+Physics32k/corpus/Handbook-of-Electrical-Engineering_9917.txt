As an illustrative example, the constant-damping ratio line for z = 0.5 is shown in Fig. 100.25. The intersect
of the z = 0.5 line and the root locus corresponds to K = 0.38. Let us assume that we want to keep the relative
damping at approximately 0.5 but the gain K should be increased tenfold. The following cascade controller is
applied to the system [Evans, 1948]:
