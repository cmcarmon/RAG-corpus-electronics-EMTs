Punched cards, paper tape, and magnetic tape are examples of sequential-access storage media. 
When operating in a sequential environment, a particular record can be read only by first reading all the 
records that come before it in the file. When you store a file on tape, the 125th record cannot be read until 
the 124 records in front of it are read. The records are read in sequence. You cannot read just any record 
at random. This is also true when reading punched cards or paper tape.
