Take,  for  example,  an  oil  pipeline  in  which  a  motor  is  pumping  oil  from  one  location  and  oil  pressure  is
being measured at a second location. The pressure reading is telemetered to a station where a decision can be
made to reduce the speed of the pump motor when the pressure is too high, or a valve may be opened at still
another  location  to  cause  the  oil  ﬂow  in  another  path.  The  decision-making  element  may  be  human,  an
experienced pipeline dispatcher, or an automatic controller. Human or automatic device—either one telemeters
a command to the control points.
