. NG ¼ (P, T ; F) is a net graph, with:
. P a ﬁnite set of nodes, called places;
. T a ﬁnite set of nodes, called transitions, disjoint from
P (P \ T ¼ 1); and
. F  (P  T ) [ (T  P) a set of directed edges called
arcs, known as the ﬂow relation.
. Sig ¼ (S, O) is a Boolean signature, where S is a set of
sorts and O is a set of operators deﬁned in the Annex A of
ISO/IEC (2002).
. V is an S-indexed set of variables, disjoint from O.
. H ¼ (SH, OH) is a many-sorted algebra for the signature
Sig, deﬁned earlier in this list:
. Type: P ! SH is a function that assigns types to places.
. AN¼ (A, TC) is a pair of net annotations.
. A: F ! TERM (O [ V ) such that for all (p, t), (t, p)
2 F and all bindings a, Vala(A(p, t )), Vala(A(t0, p))
2 mType(p). TERM(O [ V ), a, Vala and mType(p) are
deﬁned in Annex A of ISO/IEC (2002). A is a function
that annotates each arc with a term that when evaluated
(for some binding) results in a multiset over the asso-
ciated place’s type.
. TC: T ! TERM(O [ V )Bool is a function that anno-
tates transitions with Boolean expressions.
. M0: P ! [p2P mType(p)
such that 8p 2 P, M0(p) 2
mType(p) is the initial marking function that associates
a multiset of tokens (of the correct type) with each
place.
