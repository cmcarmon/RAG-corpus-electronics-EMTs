Mobility Support
The advent of wireless and cellular networks has also enhanced
multimedia applications with mobility. Cellular systems have a
large coverage area and hence permit high mobility. Another
emerging network is IEEE 802.11x wireless LAN (Crow et al.,
1997), which can operate at speeds exceeding 54 Mbps. Wire-
less LANs (WLAN) typically cover a smaller area and have
limited mobility. Their main advantage, however, is that they
work in the ISM band (no licensing required, thus eliminating
signiÔ¨Åcant investments into license purchase) and are relatively
easy to set up; moreover, there is a vast availability of cheap
WLAN products in the market that cost much less.
