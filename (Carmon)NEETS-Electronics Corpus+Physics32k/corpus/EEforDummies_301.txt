You can apply this concept of equivalent resistance to help you select resis­
tors for a specific circuit need. For example, suppose you need a 25 kΩ resis­
tor, but cannot find a standard resistor with that value. You can combine two 
standards resistors — a 22 kΩ resistor and a 3.3 kΩ resistor — in series to get 
25.3 kΩ of resistance. That’s less than 2% different from the 25 kΩ you seek — 
well within typical resistor tolerance levels (which are 5%–10%).
