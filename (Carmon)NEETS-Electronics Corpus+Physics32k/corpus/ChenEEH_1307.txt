Serial Port and Parallel Port
In general, there are two types of communication ports in a
computer: serial ports and parallel ports. A serial port is an
interface through which peripherals can be connected as a
communication channel using a serial (bit-stream) protocol.
Usually, a serial mouse is connected to COMI (communication
port 1). The most common type of serial port is a 25-pin D-
type connector carrying RS-232 signals. Smaller connectors
(e.g., 9-pin D-type) carrying a subset of RS-232 are often
used on personal computers. The serial port is usually con-
nected to an integrated circuit called a UART that handles the
conversion between serial and parallel data.
