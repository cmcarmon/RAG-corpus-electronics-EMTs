Dynamic skew errors are caused by either the magnetic tape transport or the magnetic tape itself. If
the tape transport guides are worn or sticking, the magnetic tape won’t properly pass over the magnetic
heads. It’ll drift and pass the magnetic head at an angle (like a car skidding on an icy road). If the
magnetic tape itself is warped or isn’t uniform across its width it, too, will cause dynamic skew.
