The important observation here from Figure 9.22 is that in the process
of inverting its channel, and turning itself on, the MOSFET actually forms a
parallel-plate capacitor between its gate and channel. This is emphasized in
Figure 9.23, which shows the electric field E in the silicon dioxide emanating
from the positive charge on the gate and terminating on the negative charge in
the channel. Comparing this figure to Figure 9.11 leads to the realization (from
Equation 9.4) that the gate-to-channel capacitance is approximately
