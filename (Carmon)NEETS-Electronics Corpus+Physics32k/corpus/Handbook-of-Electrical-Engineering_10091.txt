After controller outputs are computed, the weights of the controller are adjusted N times before the next
sample time. The value of N can be selected based on time constraints or convergence properties of the neural
controller and observers. If N is large, the neural observers are inaccurate; and if a large prediction horizon is
used, the adaptation of controller parameters may cause performance to deteriorate.
