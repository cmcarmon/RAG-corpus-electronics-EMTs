The Maxwell equal area rule can also be derived from an assumption of equal chemical potential μ of coexisting liquid and vapour phases. On the isotherm shown in the above plot, points a and c are the only pair of points which fulfill the equilibrium condition of having equal pressure, temperature and chemical potential. It follows that systems with volumes intermediate between these two points will consist of a mixture of the pure liquid and gas with specific volumes equal to the pure liquid and gas phases at points a and c.
The van der Waals equation may be solved for VG and VL as functions of the temperature and the vapor pressure pV. Since:

{\displaystyle p=-\left({\frac {\partial A}{\partial V}}\right)_{T,N}}

where A is the Helmholtz free energy, it follows that the equal area rule can be expressed as:

{\displaystyle p_{V}={\frac {A(V_{L},T,N)-A(V_{G},T,N)}{V_{G}-V_{L}}}}

Since the gas and liquid volumes are functions of pV and T only, this equation is then solved numerically to obtain pV as a function of temperature (and number of particles N), which may then be used to determine the gas and liquid volumes.

A pseudo-3D plot of the locus of liquid and vapor volumes versus temperature and pressure is shown in the accompanying figure. One sees that the two locii meet at the critical point (1,1,1) smoothly. An isotherm of the van der Waals fluid taken at T r = 0.90 is also shown where the intersections of the isotherm with the loci illustrate the construct's requirement that the two areas (red and blue, shown) are equal.
