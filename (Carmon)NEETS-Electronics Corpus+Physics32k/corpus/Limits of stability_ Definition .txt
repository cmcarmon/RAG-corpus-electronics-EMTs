"Limits of Stability (LoS) are defined as the points at which the center of gravity (CoG) approach's the limits of the base of support (BoS) and a correction strategy is required to return the center of mass (CoM) to within the BoS." In other words, LoS is the amount of maximum excursion an individual is able to intentionally cover in any direction without losing his/her balance or taking a step. The normal sway angle in the antero-posterior direction and medio-lateral direction is approximately 12.5° and 16° respectively. This area of stable swaying is often referred to as the 'Cone of Stability'. The limits of this cone of stability keep changing constantly depending on the task being performed.
Once the CoG moves outside the BoS, the individual must step or grasp an external device in-order to maintain his balance and refrain himself from falling.
These stability limits are perceived rather than the physiological, i.e. it is the readiness of the subject to change their COG position.
