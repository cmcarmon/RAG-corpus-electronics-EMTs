We consider the case where Alice and Bob try to determine if they both have the same string. That is, we are trying to determine if x is equal to y. It is easy to prove that the equality problem (EQ) will always require you to communicate n bits in the worst case if you want to be absolutely sure x and y are equal. Consider the simple case of x and y being 3 bits. The equality function in this case can be represented by the matrix below. The rows representing all the possibilities of x, the columns those of y.
As you can see, the function only evaluates to 1 when x equals y (i.e., on the diagonal). It is also fairly easy to see how communicating a single bit divides your possibilities in half. If you know that the first bit of y is 1, you only need to consider half of the columns (where y can equal 100, 101, 110, or 111).
