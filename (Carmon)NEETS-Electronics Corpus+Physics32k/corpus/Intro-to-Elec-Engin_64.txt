Batteries and ac outlets are the familiar electric sources. These are voltage sources. An ideal
voltage source is one whose terminal voltage v is a speciﬁed function of time, regardless of the
current i through the source. An ideal battery has a constant voltage V with respect to time, as
shown in Figure 1.1.5(a). It is known as a dc source, because i = I is a direct current. Figure
1.1.5(b) shows the symbol and time variation for a sinusoidal voltage source with v = Vm cos ωt.
The positive sign on the source symbol indicates instantaneous polarity of the terminal at the
higher potential whenever cos ωt is positive. A sinusoidal source is generally termed an ac source
because such a voltage source tends to produce an alternating current.
