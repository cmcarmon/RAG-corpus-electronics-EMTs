The  emitter  resistor  RE  was  included  for  biasing  reasons
(although  there  are  other  bias  circuits  that  omit  it),  but  for
signal  ampliﬁcation  purposes  it  must  be  shunted  by  a  high-
value capacitor CE so that the signal current can ﬂow down to ground without producing a signal voltage drop
leading to negative feedback (as did the bias current). The value of CE must be much greater than is apparent
at ﬁrst sight, and this point will be developed later; for the present, it will be assumed that it is large enough
to constitute a short circuit at all the signal frequencies of interest. So, for ac signals RE is short-circuited and
only RC acts as a load. This implies that a signal or ac load line comes into operation with a slope of –1/R C, as
shown in Fig. 24.30.
