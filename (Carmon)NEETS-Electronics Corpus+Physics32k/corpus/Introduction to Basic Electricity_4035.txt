Blocking	oscillators and multivibrators are 
relaxation oscillators. Figure 39-14 shows a blocking 
oscillator circuit. The reason for the name is that the 
transistor is easily driven into the blocking (cutoff) 
mode. The blocking condition is determined by the 
discharge from capacitor C1. Capacitor C1 is charged 
through the emitter-base junction of  transistor Q1. 
However, once capacitor C1 is charged, the only 
 discharge path is through resistor R1. The RC time 
 constant of resistor R1 and capacitor C1  determines 
how long the transistor is blocked, or cut off, and 
also  determines the oscillator frequency. A long time 
 constant produces a low frequency; a short time 
 constant produces a high frequency.
