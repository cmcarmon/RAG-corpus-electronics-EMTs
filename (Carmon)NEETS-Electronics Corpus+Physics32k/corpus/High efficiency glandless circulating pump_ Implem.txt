These types of pumps are used primarily in heating and air conditioning systems within both residential and commercial buildings such as offices and apartment complexes. The pump is the central component of these systems and accounts for most of the electricity usage within the system, making its design key to an increase in efficiency and decrease in energy consumption. Although the pump can be installed both inside and outside of buildings, many precautions must be taken in order to protect the pump from unfavorable weather conditions. These pumps are fairly simple to integrate into systems that follow the old standard since each pump is able to increase its efficiency by changing its design internally, meaning it will still fit into older systems without any problems requiring special adapters.
