Switches are used in bridge circuits to control the application of operating power to the bridge and to 
complete the detector circuit. Frequently, the two switching functions are combined into a single key, 
called a bridge key, so that the operating power is applied to the bridge prior to the detector circuit. This 
sequence reduces the effects of inductance and capacitance during the process of measurement.
