At the end of this first quarter-cycle the alternating voltage stops increasing in the positive direction 
and starts to decrease. It is still a positive voltage, but to the capacitor the decrease in voltage means that 
the plate which has just accumulated an excess of electrons must lose some electrons. The current flow, 
therefore, must reverse its direction. Part (B) of the figure shows the current curve to be below the zero 
line (negative current direction) during the second quarter-cycle (90ยบ  to 180ยบ).
