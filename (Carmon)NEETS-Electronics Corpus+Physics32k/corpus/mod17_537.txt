AUTOMATIC TRACKING.â€”In automatic tracking, the equipment generates antenna pointing 
information by comparing the direction of the antenna axis with the direction from which an actual 
satellite signal is received. Automatic tracking systems track the apparent position of a satellite. The 
direction of arrival of the radio signal and the real position of the satellite is not required. The automatic 
tracking system uses a servomechanism to move the antenna. Once the satellite has been located, the 
servomechanism generates its own pointing data. This eliminates the requirement for continuous data 
input and computation.
