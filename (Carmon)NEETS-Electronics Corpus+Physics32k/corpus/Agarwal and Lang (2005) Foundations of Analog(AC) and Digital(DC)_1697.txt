Thus, the total energy wT is constant in time. This is the case because there
are no resistors in the circuit that could dissipate the energy. Note too that
the energy completely exchanges between the two elements since both wE
and wM periodically go to zero. This behavior is also identical to that of many
other lossless second-order mechanical oscillators in which kinetic and potential
energies are repetitively exchanged. To illustrate this, Figure 12.8 shows the wE,
wM, and wT for the special case of iL(0) ≡ 0. Note that the energies exchange
at the frequency 2ω◦ because both iL and vC go to zero twice during the period
2π/ω◦.
