In MCV control, we deﬁne a class of admissible controllers,
and then the cost variance is minimized within that class of
controllers. Deﬁne V1(t , x; k) ¼ E{J (t, x(t), k)jx(t) ¼ x} and
V2(t , x; k) ¼ E{J 2(t, x(t), k)jx(t ) ¼ x}. A function M is an
admissible mean cost criterion if there exists an admissible
control law k such that:
