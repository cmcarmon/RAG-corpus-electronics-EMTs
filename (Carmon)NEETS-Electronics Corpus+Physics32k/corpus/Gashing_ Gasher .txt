The process is similar to that outlined for the universal milling machine except a gashing angle is not used. When gashing spur gears, racks, or bevel gears the cutter is plunged into the workpiece and then moved linearly in the proper direction. If a helical gear is being roughed out, then the table rotates and moves along the vertical axis to interpolate the helical path.
The two most common cutting tools are formed milling cutters and cutters with indexable carbide inserts. For very large gears a cutter might be replaced with two slitting cutters that cut triangular slugs from the blank.
