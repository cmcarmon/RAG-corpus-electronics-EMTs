If DC voltage is applied to a transformer, noth-
ing occurs in the secondary once the magnetic field 
is established. A changing current in the primary 
winding is necessary to induce a voltage in the 
secondary winding. A transformer can be used to 
isolate the secondary from any DC voltage in the 
primary (Figure 27-6).
