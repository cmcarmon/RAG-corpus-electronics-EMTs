Obviously, the simple synchro transmitter-receiver system discussed so far could not handle a job of 
this sort. A different type of synchro is needed, one which can accept two signals simultaneously, add or 
subtract the signals, and furnish an output proportional to their sum or difference. This is where the 
SYNCHRO DIFFERENTIAL enters the picture. A differential can perform all of these functions.
