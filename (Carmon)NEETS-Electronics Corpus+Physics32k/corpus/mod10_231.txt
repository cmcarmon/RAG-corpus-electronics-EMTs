Since each successive E field is generated with a polarity that is opposite the preceding E field (that 
is, the lines of force are opposite), an oscillating electric field is produced along the path of travel. When 
an electric field oscillates, a magnetic field having an intensity that varies directly with that of the E field 
is produced. The variations in magnetic field intensity, in turn, produce another E field. Thus, the two 
varying fields sustain each other, resulting in electromagnetic wave propagation.
