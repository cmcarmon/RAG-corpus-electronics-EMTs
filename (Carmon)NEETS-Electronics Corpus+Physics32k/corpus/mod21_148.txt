To make the CATH ACT test, allow the tube under test to warm up, press button number 2 (fig. 2-1),
and note the reading of scale number 2 on meter M301. Note also the numerical scale reading on M301.
Next, lock down the CATH ACT button (fig. 2-2), wait for about 1.5 minutes, then press button number 2
(fig. 2-1) again and note the numerical and number 2 scale readings on meter M301. The tube should be
replaced if the numerical reading on M301 differs from the first reading by more than 10 percent or if the
reading is in the red area on the number 2 scale.
