The picture you want to transmit is mounted on a cylindrical scanning drum. This drum rotates at a 
constant speed and at the same time moves longitudinally along a shaft. Light from an exciter lamp 
illuminates a small segment of the moving picture and is reflected by the picture through an aperture to a 
phototube. During picture transmission, the light crosses every segment of the picture as the drum slowly 
spirals past the fixed lighted area.
