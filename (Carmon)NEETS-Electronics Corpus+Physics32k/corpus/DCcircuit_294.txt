With water sprinkled on my ﬁngers to simulate sweat, I was able to measure a hand-to-
hand resistance of only 17,000 ohms (17 kΩ). Bear in mind this is only with one ﬁnger of each
hand contacting a thin metal wire. Recalculating the voltage required to cause a current of 20
milliamps, we obtain this ﬁgure:
