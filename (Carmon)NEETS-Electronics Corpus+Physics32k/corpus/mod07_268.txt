When a PN-junction diode is reverse biased, the majority carriers (holes in the P-material and 
electrons in the N-material) move away from the junction. The barrier or depletion region becomes wider, 
as illustrated in figure 3-1, (view A, view B, view C) and majority carrier current flow becomes very 
difficult across the high resistance of the wide depletion region. The presence of minority carriers causes 
a small leakage current that remains nearly constant for all reverse voltages up to a certain value. Once 
this value has been exceeded, there is a sudden increase in the reverse current. The voltage at which the 
sudden increase in current occurs is called the BREAKDOWN VOLTAGE. At breakdown, the reverse 
current increases very rapidly with a slight increase in the reverse voltage. Any diode can be reverse 
biased to the point of breakdown, but not every diode can safely dissipate the power associated with 
breakdown. A Zener diode is a PN junction designed to operate in the reverse-bias breakdown region.
