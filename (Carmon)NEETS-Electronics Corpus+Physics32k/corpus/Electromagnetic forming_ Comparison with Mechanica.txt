Electromagnetic forming has a number of advantages and disadvantages compared to conventional mechanical forming techniques.
Some of the advantages are;
Improved formability (the amount of stretch available without tearing)
Wrinkling can be greatly suppressed
Forming can be combined with joining and assembling with dissimilar components including glass, plastic, composites and other metals.
Close tolerances are possible as springback can be significantly reduced.
Single sided dies are sufficient which can reduce tooling costs
Lubricants are reduced or are unnecessary, so forming can be used in clean room conditions
Mechanical contact with the workpiece is not required, this avoids surface contamination and tooling marks. As a result, a surface finish can be applied to the workpiece before forming.
The principle disadvantages are;
Non conductive materials cannot be formed directly, but can be formed using a conductive drive plate
The high voltages and currents involved require careful safety considerations
