Imagine using a tire pressure gauge that took so great a volume of air to operate that it
would deﬂate any tire it was connected to. The amount of air consumed by the pressure gauge
in the act of measurement is analogous to the current taken by the voltmeter movement to
move the needle. The less air a pressure gauge requires to operate, the less it will deﬂate the
tire under test. The less current drawn by a voltmeter to actuate the needle, the less it will
burden the circuit under test.
