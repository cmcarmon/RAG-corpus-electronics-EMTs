In order to adapt to the limitations of the power available, the cost requirements, and the widely varying
operating  requirements,  small  motors  are  available  in  a  great  variety  of  designs.  Some  of  the  small  motors
require electronics in order to start and operate, while others can start and run directly connected to the supply
line.
