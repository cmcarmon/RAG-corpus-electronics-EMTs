Thermal radiation occurs through a vacuum or any transparent medium (solid or fluid). It is the transfer of energy by means of photons in electromagnetic waves governed by the same laws.
Thermal radiation is energy emitted by matter as electromagnetic waves, due to the pool of thermal energy in all matter with a temperature above absolute zero. Thermal radiation propagates without the presence of matter through the vacuum of space.
Thermal radiation is a direct result of the random movements of atoms and molecules in matter. Since these atoms and molecules are composed of charged particles (protons and electrons), their movement results in the emission of electromagnetic radiation, which carries energy away from the surface.
The Stefan-Boltzmann equation, which describes the rate of transfer of radiant energy, is as follows for an object in a vacuum :

{\displaystyle Q=\epsilon \sigma T^{4}.}

For radiative transfer between two objects, the equation is as follows:

{\displaystyle Q=\epsilon \sigma (T_{a}^{4}-T_{b}^{4}),}

where Q is the heat flux, ε is the emissivity (unity for a black body), σ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature (in kelvins or degrees Rankine). Radiation is typically only important for very hot objects, or for objects with a large temperature difference.
Radiation from the sun, or solar radiation, can be harvested for heat and power. Unlike conductive and convective forms of heat transfer, thermal radiation can be concentrated in a small spot by using reflecting mirrors, which is exploited in concentrating solar power generation. For example, the sunlight reflected from mirrors heats the PS10 solar power tower and during the day it can heat water to 285 °C (545 °F).
