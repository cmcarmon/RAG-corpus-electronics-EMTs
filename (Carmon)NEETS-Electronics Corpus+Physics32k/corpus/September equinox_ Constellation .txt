The point where the Sun crosses the celestial equator southwards is called the first point of Libra. However, due to the precession of the equinoxes, this point is no longer in the constellation Libra, but rather in Virgo.
The September equinox passed from Libra into Virgo in year âˆ’729, will pass into Leo in year 2439.
