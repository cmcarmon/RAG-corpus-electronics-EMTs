The lossless line approximation is the least accurate model; it is often used on short lines when the inductance of the line is much greater than its resistance. For this approximation, the voltage and current are identical at the sending and receiving ends.

The characteristic impedance is pure real, which means resistive for that impedance. And it is often called surge impedance for a lossless line. When lossless line is terminated by surge impedance, there is no voltage drop. Because though the phase angles of voltage and current are rotated, the magnitudes of voltage and current remain constant along the length of the line. For load > SIL, the voltage will drop from sending end and the line will “consume” VARs. For load < SIL, the voltage will increase from sending end, and the line will “generate” VARs.
