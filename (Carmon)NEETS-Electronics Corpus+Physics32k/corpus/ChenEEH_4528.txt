This chapter, adapted from Liberty and Saeks (1973, 1974),
contains a particular viewpoint on the mathematical modeling
of systems that focuses on an explicit algebraic description of
system connection information. The resulting system repre-
sentation is called the component connection model. The
component connection approach to system modeling provides
useful ways to tackle a variety of system problems and has
signiﬁcant conceptual value. The general applicability of this
viewpoint to some of these system problems is presented here
at a conceptual level. Readers interested in speciﬁc examples
illustrating the component connection model should ﬁrst refer
to Decarlo and Saeks (1981). Additional references are pro-
vided on speciﬁc applications of the component connection
philosophy to system problems. Readers with a clear under-
standing of the general concept of function should have no
difﬁculty comprehending the material in this section.
