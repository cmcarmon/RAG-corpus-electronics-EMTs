current. You can easily find 4 Ω, 8 Ω, 16 Ω, and 32 Ω speakers. It’s impor-
tant to select a speaker that matches the minimum impedance rating of 
the amplifier you’re using to drive the speaker. (You can find that rating 
in the datasheet for the amplifier on your supplier’s website.) If the 
speaker impedance is too high, you won’t get as much volume out of the 
speaker as you could. If the speaker impedance is too low, you may over-
heat your amplifier.
