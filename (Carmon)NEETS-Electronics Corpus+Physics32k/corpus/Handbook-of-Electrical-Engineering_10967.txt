Strength/duration relationships derived from the myelinated nerve model: current thresholds and charge
thresholds for single-pulse monophasic and for single-cycle biphasic stimuli with initial cathodal phase, point electrode 2
mm distant from 20 mm ﬁber. Threshold current refers to the peak of the stimulus waveform. Charge refers to a single phase
for  biphasic  stimuli.  (Source:  J.  P.  Reilly, V.  T.  Freeman,  and W.  D.  Larkin, “Sensory  effects  of  transient  electrical  stimula-
