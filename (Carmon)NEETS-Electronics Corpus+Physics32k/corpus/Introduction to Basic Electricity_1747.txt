As stated earlier, current flows from a point with an 
excess of electrons to a point with a deficiency of 
electrons. The path that the current follows is called 
an electric	circuit. All electric circuits consist of a 
voltage source, a load, and a conductor. The volt-
age source establishes a difference of potential that 
forces the current to flow. The source can be a bat-
tery, a generator, or another of the devices described 
in Chapter 12: Voltage. The load consists of some 
type of resistance to current flow. The resistance may 
be high or low, depending on the purpose of the cir-
cuit. The current in the circuit flows through a con-
ductor from the source to the load. The conductor 
must give up electrons easily. Copper is used for most 
conductors.
