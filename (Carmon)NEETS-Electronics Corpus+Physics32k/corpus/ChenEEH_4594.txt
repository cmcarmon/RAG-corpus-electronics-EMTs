where p(m) and t (m) are the network input vector and desired
output vector at time-step m, respectively. The k is the current
time-step, and j represents the length of the time-shifting data
window, which is a design parameter. This parameter has to be
decided based on the system computational capability, sam-
pling rate, and the performance requirement. In addition, the
maximum number of the effective control signal searching
iterations is another important design parameter in real-time
applications. The number has to be within an allowable range
according to the system computational capacity in the online
situation. For gradient descent-type of optimization algo-
rithms, a time-varying learning rate can be used to possibly
reduce the searching time.
