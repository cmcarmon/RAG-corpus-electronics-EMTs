The ”water level indicator” (LI) is nothing more than a pressure gauge measuring the air
pressure in the pneumatic signal line. This air pressure, being a signal, is in turn a represen-
tation of the water level in the tank. Any variation of level in the tank can be represented by
an appropriate variation in the pressure of the pneumatic signal. Aside from certain practical
