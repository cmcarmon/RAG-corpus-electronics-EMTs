Never solder a circuit with power flowing through it! Make sure the battery 
or other power supply is disconnected before you apply your soldering iron 
to components. If your iron has an adjustable temperature control, dial up 
the recommended setting for the solder you’re using. And if your soldering 
iron accidentally goes belly‐up, stand back and let it fall. If you try to grab it, 
Murphy’s Law says you’ll grab the hot end.
