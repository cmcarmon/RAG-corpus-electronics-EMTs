Humidity combines with heat to create a more uncomfortable apparent temperature. By using table 
1-38 you can figure the apparent temperature caused by various combinations of air temperature and 
humidity. Remember, in heat waves the apparent temperatures may run 15 to 30 degrees higher in more 
humid areas.
