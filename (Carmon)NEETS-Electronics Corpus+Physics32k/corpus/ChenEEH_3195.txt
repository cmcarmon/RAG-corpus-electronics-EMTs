The use of resistive or semiconducting glazed porcelain insu-
lators, in place of normal porcelain insulators for contami-
nated locations (RG) is a well-known practice that was ﬁrst
tried more than 50 years ago. The semiconducting glaze offers
a lower resistance than the normal insulating glaze and pro-
motes a steady current (less than 1 mA) at the nominal oper-
ating voltage. This current ensures a more linear voltage
distribution, and the resulting I 2R heating keeps the surface
warm, ensuring that large areas of the insulator are dry. This
combination of factors signiﬁcantly reduces dry-band dis-
charges and improves the contamination performance. The
ability to curtail discharges in the presence of wet contamin-
ation is shown schematically in Figure 5.8.
