The capacitor shown in figure 3-22 is a tubular capacitor. Because this type of capacitor always has a
paper dielectric, the type code is omitted. To read the code, hold the capacitor so the band closest to the end
is on the left side; then read left to right. The last two bands (the fifth and sixth bands from the left) represent
the voltage rating of the capacitor. This means that if a capacitor is coded red, red, red, yellow, yellow,
yellow, it has the following digit values:
