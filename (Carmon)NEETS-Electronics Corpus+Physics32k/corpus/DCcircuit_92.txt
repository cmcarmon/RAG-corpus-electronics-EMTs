When electrons move against the opposition of resistance, ”friction” is generated. Just like
mechanical friction, the friction produced by electrons ﬂowing against a resistance manifests
itself in the form of heat. The concentrated resistance of a lamp’s ﬁlament results in a relatively
large amount of heat energy dissipated at that ﬁlament. This heat energy is enough to cause
the ﬁlament to glow white-hot, producing light, whereas the wires connecting the lamp to the
battery (which have much lower resistance) hardly even get warm while conducting the same
amount of current.
