When components are purchased directly to order/ship, the SFI Detail Code may be used as a technical account.
The spare part manufacturer may have its own numbering system. For a shipping company it is often convenient to establish a spare part numbering system comprising the SFI Detail Code + consecutive numbers:
731.001 - Starting air compressor
731.001.001 - HP cylinder
731.001.002 - LP cylinder
731.001.003 - HP cylinder cover
731.001.004 - LP cylinder cover
