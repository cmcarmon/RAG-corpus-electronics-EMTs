In the preceding sections of this chapter, we used the node method to analyze
the behavior of various second-order circuits. This form of analysis directly yields
the node voltages within a circuit expressed as functions of time. However, as
noted earlier, we are often more interested in the circuit states than we are in
the node voltages. In this case, we must use the node voltages to determine the
states, and this takes additional effort. As we shall see shortly, there exists an
alternative method of analysis that is particularly useful when the circuit states
are of primary interest. We will refer to this method as state-variable analysis.
Its principal advantage is that it offers a more direct way to obtain the equations
which govern state evolution, and hence a more direct way to determine the
states themselves. Of course, to determine the node voltages from the results
of a state-variable analysis also requires additional effort. Thus, when both the
states and node voltages are of interest, there may be no best choice of analysis.
The first step of a state-variable analysis is to derive the differential equations
that explicitly govern the evolution of the circuit states. The second step is to
solve these state equations for the states as functions of time. The states may
then be used to determine any other branch variables of interest. Here, we
will focus only on the first step since the solution of the differential equations
that are the state equations may be executed using the same method employed
earlier in this chapter, or the method developed in Section 12.10.
