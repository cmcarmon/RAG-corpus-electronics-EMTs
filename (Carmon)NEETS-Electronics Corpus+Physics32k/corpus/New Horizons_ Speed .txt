New Horizons has been called "the fastest spacecraft ever launched" because it left Earth at 16.26 kilometers per second (58,536 km/h; 36,373 mph), faster than any other spacecraft to date. It is also the first spacecraft launched directly into a solar escape trajectory, which requires an approximate speed while near Earth of 16.5 km/s (59,000 km/h; 37,000 mph), plus additional delta-v to cover air and gravity drag, all to be provided by the launch vehicle.
However, it is not the fastest spacecraft to leave the Solar System. As of January 2018, this record is held by Voyager 1, traveling at 16.985 km/s (61,146 km/h; 37,994 mph) relative to the Sun. Voyager 1 attained greater hyperbolic excess velocity from gravitational slingshots by Jupiter and Saturn than New Horizons. When New Horizons reaches the distance of 100 AU, it will be travelling at about 13 km/s (47,000 km/h; 29,000 mph), around 4 km/s (14,000 km/h; 8,900 mph) slower than Voyager 1 at that distance. Other spacecraft, such as the Helios probes, can also be measured as the fastest objects, because of their orbital speed relative to the Sun at perihelion: 68.7 km/s (247,000 km/h; 154,000 mph) for Helios-B. Because they remain in solar orbit, their specific orbital energy relative to the Sun is lower than New Horizons and other artificial objects escaping the Solar System.
New Horizons' Star 48B third stage is also on a hyperbolic escape trajectory from the Solar System, and reached Jupiter before the New Horizons spacecraft. The Star 48B was expected to cross Pluto's orbit on October 15, 2015. Because it is not in controlled flight, it did not receive the correct gravity assist, and passed within 200 million km (120 million mi) of Pluto. The Centaur second stage did not achieve solar escape velocity, and is in heliocentric orbit.
