S/N = signal-to-noise ratio.
Smin = the minimum detectable target-signal power that, with a given probability of success, the radar
can be said to detect, acquire, or track in the presence of its own thermal noise or some external
interference. Since all these factors (including the target return itself) are generally noiselike,
the criterion for a detection can be described only by some form of probability distribution
with an associated probability of detection PD and a probability that, in the absence of a target
signal, one or more noise or interference samples will be mistaken for the target of interest.
