A third effect of emitter degeneration is a decrease in the effective pole time constant, TpCE , as well as an
increase  in  the  effective  zero  time  constant,  TzCE ,  which  can  be  conÔ¨Årmed  by  reinvestigating  Eqs.  (28.18)
through (28.21) for the case of Re replaced by the resistance sum (Re + REE). The use of an emitter degeneration
resistance therefore promotes an increased 3-dB circuit bandwidth. Unfortunately, it also yields a diminished
circuit  gain-bandwidth  product;  that  is,  a  given  emitter  degeneration  resistance  causes  a  degradation  in  the
low  frequency  gain  magnitude  that  is  larger  than  the  corresponding  bandwidth  increase  promoted  by  this
resistance. This deterioration of circuit gain-bandwidth product is a property of all negative feedback circuits
[Choma, 1984].
