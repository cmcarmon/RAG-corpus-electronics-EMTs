Once the piston is completely removed, you will be able to see multiple seals on different parts that are connected to the piston rod . First of all, you need to examine the piston rod to see if there is any damage. If the shaft of the rod is bent or if the cylinder bore has scratches, then get them repaired at a professional repair shop. If the damage is permanent, then you can order or manufacture a new piston rod for your hydraulic cylinder. Piston seals can get damaged, be distorted, or worn. Such damaged seals can cause leakage of hydraulic fluid from the cylinder leading to lower overall pressure or inability to hold pressure. When such events occur, you know that these seals need to be replaced.
