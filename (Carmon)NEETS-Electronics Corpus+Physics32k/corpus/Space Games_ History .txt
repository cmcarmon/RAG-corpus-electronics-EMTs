The Space Games came about as a result of the Atmosphere Dolphin FreeFly License Program ran through Olav ZIpser's First School of Modern SkyFlying. Zipser used a constant speed and direction measuring device (space balls) around which high speed precision freefly athletes could train and be tested to fly to the same standard. This provided the testing ground for the research and development of freeflying, and opened up the possibility for a number of human flight air games and competitions.
The 1st Space Games was held at Skydive America Palm Beach, Pahokee, Florida in 1997.
The most recent and 16th Space Games was held at Skydive Sport Center Tortuga, Arezzo, Italy in 2006.
