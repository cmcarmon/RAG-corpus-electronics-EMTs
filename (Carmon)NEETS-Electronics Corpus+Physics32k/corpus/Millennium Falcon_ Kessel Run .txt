In the initial film, Solo brags that the Falcon made the Kessel Run in "less than twelve parsecs". As the parsec is a unit of distance, not time, different explanations have been provided. In the fourth draft of the script, Kenobi "reacts to Soloâ€™s stupid attempt to impress them with obvious misinformation". In the Expanded Universe, the Kessel Run is a pathway from Kessel past the Maw Black Hole Cluster: used by smugglers to transport precious Glitterstim spice; and Solo's bragging refers to his ability to move the ship closer to the Maw's black holes and therefore shorten the distance traveled. On the Star Wars DVD audio commentary, Lucas comments that, in the Star Wars universe, traveling through hyperspace requires careful navigation to avoid stars, planets, asteroids, and other obstacles, and that because no long-distance journey can be made in a straight line, the "fastest" ship is the one that can plot the "most direct course", thereby traveling the least distance.
The novelization changes the line to "twelve Standard Time Units".
