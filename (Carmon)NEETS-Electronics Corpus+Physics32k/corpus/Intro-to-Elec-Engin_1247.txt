*13.2.22 A three-phase, four-pole, 220-V, 60-Hz induction
machine with a per-phase resistance of 0.5  is
operating at rated voltage as a generator at a slip
of −0.04, delivering 12 A of line current and a
total output of 4000 W. The constant losses from
a no-load run as a motor are given to be 220 W,
of which 70 W represents friction and windage
losses. Calculate the efﬁciency of the induction
generator.
