Slew  rate  is  the  rate  of  change  of  output  voltage 
with time, when a rectangular step input voltage is 
applied (as shown in Fig. 8.4). The slew rate of an 
operational amplifier is the rate of change of output 
voltage  with  time  in  response  to  a  perfect  step-
function input. Hence:
