National Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors
The National Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors
 (NTRS) is an almost 200-page volume distributed by the
Semiconductor  Industry  Association  (SIA).  Focused  on  mainstream  leading  edge  technology,  the  roadmap
provides  a  common  vision  for  the  industry.  It  enables  a  degree  of  cooperative  precompetitive  research  and
development among the ﬁercely competitive semiconductor device manufacturers. It is a dynamic document
which will be revised and reissued to reﬂect learning on an as-needed basis.
