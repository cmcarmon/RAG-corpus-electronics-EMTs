. The currents used in this expression
i
where 
km
are  understood  to  be  the  currents  that  would  be  measured  in  the  branches  attached  to  the  node,  and  their
values include a magnitude and an algebraic sign. If the measurement convention is oriented for the case where
currents are entering the node, then the actual current in a branch has a positive or negative sign, depending
on whether the current is truly ï¬‚owing toward the node in question.
