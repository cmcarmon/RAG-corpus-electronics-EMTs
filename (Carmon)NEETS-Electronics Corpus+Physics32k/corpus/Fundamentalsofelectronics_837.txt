• Variability of the Noise Term — We quantify variability by the spectral height of the white noise
• Probability Distribution of the Noise Term — The value of the noise terms relative to the
signal terms and the probability of their occurrence directly aﬀect the likelihood that a receiver error
will occur. For the white noise we have been considering, the underlying distributions are Gaussian.
Deriving the following expression for the probability the receiver makes an error on any bit transmission
is complicated but can be found in other modules: here22 and here23.
