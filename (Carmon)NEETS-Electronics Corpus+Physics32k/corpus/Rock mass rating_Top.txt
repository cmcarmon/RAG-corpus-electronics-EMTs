The Rock Mass Rating (RMR) System is a geomechanical classification system for rocks, developed by Z. T. Bieniawski [1] between 1972 and 1973. It combines the most significant geologic parameters of influence and represents them with one overall comprehensive index of rock mass quality, which is used for the design and construction of excavations in rock, such as tunnels, mines, slopes and foundations.
