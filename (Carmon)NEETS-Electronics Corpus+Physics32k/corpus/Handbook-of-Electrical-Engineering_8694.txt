Disassembler: A computer program which can take an executable image and convert it back into assembly code.
Such  a  reconstruction  will  be  true  to  the  machine  language  but  normally  loses  much  of  the  convenience
factors, such as macros and name equivalencies, that an original assembly language program may contain.
Executable image: A program in pure machine code and including all of the necessary header information
that allows an operating system to load it and start running it. Since it can be run directly, it is executable.
Since it represents the original HLL or assembly program it is an image.
