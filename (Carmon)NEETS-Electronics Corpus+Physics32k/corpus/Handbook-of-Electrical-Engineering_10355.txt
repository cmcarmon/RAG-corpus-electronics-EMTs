Audio
The use of commercial broadcast audio transmission via satellite began in the late 1970s with National Public
Radio and Mutual Broadcasting using Western Unionâ€™s WESTAR I satellite. The main application was to send
high-quality audio to radio broadcast stations to transmit programming information. This type of system makes
use of single channel per carrier (SCPC) satellite transmission, where each satellite channel corresponds to one
audio channel. The entire satellite channel is FM modulated. Pre-emphasis is used over the channel to provide
additional noise reduction. A variation of this technique, called multiple channel per carrier (MCPC), can be
used to transmit multiple channels over a single satellite carrier. Figure 102.12 is a block diagram of the MCPC
system.
