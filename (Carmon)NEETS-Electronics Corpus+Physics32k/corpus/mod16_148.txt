Point-to-point voltage measurement charts, usually found in equipment technical manuals, contain
the normal operating voltages found in the various stages of the equipment. These voltages are usually
measured between indicated points and ground unless otherwise stated. When you begin recording
voltage measurements, it is a smart and safe practice to set the voltmeter on the highest range before
measuring. This ensures that excessive voltages existing in the circuit will not cause overloading of the
meter.
