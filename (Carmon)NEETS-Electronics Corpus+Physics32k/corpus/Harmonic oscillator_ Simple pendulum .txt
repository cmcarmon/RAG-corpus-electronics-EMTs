Assuming no damping, the differential equation governing a simple pendulum of length



ℓ


{\displaystyle \ell }
, where



g


{\displaystyle g}
is the local acceleration of gravity, is

sin

θ
=
0.


{\displaystyle {\frac {d^{2}\theta }{dt^{2}}}+{\frac {g}{\ell }}\sin \theta =0.}

If the maximum displacement of the pendulum is small, we can use the approximation



sin

θ
≈

{\displaystyle \sin \theta \approx \theta }
and instead consider the equation

{\displaystyle {\frac {d^{2}\theta }{dt^{2}}}+{\frac {g}{\ell }}\theta =0.}

The solution to this equation is given by:

{\displaystyle \theta (t)=\theta _{0}\cos \left({\sqrt {g \over \ell }}t\right)}

where
