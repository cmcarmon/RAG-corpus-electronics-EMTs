Small-diameter copper wires are terminated with solderless, preinsulated copper terminal lugs. As 
shown in figure 2-19, the insulation is part of the terminal lug. It extends beyond the barrel so that it 
covers a portion of the wire insulation. This makes the use of spaghetti or heat-shrinkable tubing 
unnecessary. Preinsulated terminal lugs also have an insulation support (a metal reinforcing sleeve)
