The New Shepard is launched vertically from West Texas and then performs a powered flight for about 110 s and to an altitude of 40 km (130,000 ft). The craft's momentum carries it upward in unpowered flight as the vehicle slows, culminating at an altitude of about 100 km (330,000 ft). After reaching apogee the vehicle would perform a descent and restart its main engines a few tens of seconds before vertical landing, close to its launch site. The total mission duration is planned to be 10 minutes.
The crewed variant would feature a separate crew module that could separate close to peak altitude, and the propulsion module would perform a powered landing while the crew module would land under parachutes. The crew module can also separate in case of vehicle malfunction or other emergency using solid propellant separation boosters and perform a parachute landing.
New Shepard is in the midst of a two-year long test program. Uncrewed flights began in 2015 and will continue into 2017. Blue Origin has plans to test the vehicle with "test passengers" for the first time in early 2018, and commercial flights are slated to begin shortly after.
