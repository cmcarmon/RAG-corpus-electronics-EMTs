Thus at local noon or midnight, latitude can be calculated by simple arithmetic. Tables of declination, the angle
of the sun or star above the earth’s equatorial plane, were part of the ancient navigator’s proprietary lore. The
declination  of  the  sun  was  ﬁrst  publicly  tabulated  in  the  ﬁfteenth  century  in  Spain.  When  time  became
measurable at sea, with a chronometer in the nineteenth century and by radio in the twentieth century, off-
meridian observations of the elevation of two or more celestial bodies were possible at any known time of night
(cloud  cover  permitting).  These  ﬁxes  were  hand-calculated  using  logarithms,  then  plotted  on  charts.  In  the
1930s, hand-held sextants were built that measured the elevation of celestial bodies from an aircraft using a
bubble-level reference instead of the horizon. The accuracy of celestial ﬁxes was 3–10 miles at sea and 5–20 miles
in the air, limited by the uncertainty in the horizon and the inability to make precise angular measurements
on a pitching, rolling vehicle. Kayton (1990) reviews the history of celestial navigation at sea and in the air.
