BSIM2. The BSIM2 model was developed to address the shortcomings of the BSIM model. This was basically
an extension of the BSIM model, removing certain parameters that had very little effect, ﬁxing fundamental
problems such as currents varying the wrong way as a function of certain parameters, adding more unphysical
ﬁtting parameters, and adding parameters to allow ﬁtting Gds . BSIM2 does ﬁt better than BSIM, but with more
than twice as many parameters as BSIM, it should. However, it does not address the crucial problem of ﬁtting
large geometry variations. Its major strengths over BSIM are ﬁtting the subthreshold region better, and ﬁtting
Gds  better.  Most  of  the  other  shortcomings  of  BSIM  are  also  present  in  BSIM2,  and  the  large  number  of
parameters in BSIM2 makes it a real chore to use in device characterization.
