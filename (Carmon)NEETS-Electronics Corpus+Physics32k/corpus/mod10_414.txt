The principal advantage of the shielded pair is that the conductors are balanced to ground; that is, the
capacitance between the wires is uniform throughout the length of the line. This balance is due to the
uniform spacing of the grounded shield that surrounds the wires along their entire length. The braided
copper shield isolates the conductors from stray magnetic fields.
