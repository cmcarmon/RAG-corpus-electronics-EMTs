At frequencies in the lf and mf regions of the frequency spectrum, single-layered, universal, spiral,
and other types of windings are used. When size is a factor, the more compact windings are preferred to
the single-layered type of coil. At frequencies below 500 kilohertz, the single-layered type is too large for
practical use; therefore, the more compact types are used exclusively.
