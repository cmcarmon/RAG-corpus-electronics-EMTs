When more than one loop or circuit is present, the ﬂux produced by the current in one
loop may link another loop, thereby inducing a current in that loop. Such loops are said to
be mutually coupled, and there exists a mutual inductance between such loops. The mutual
inductance between two circuits is deﬁned as the ﬂux linkage produced in one circuit by a current
of 1 ampere in the other circuit. Let us now consider a pair of mutually coupled inductors, as
shown in Figure 1.2.9. The self-inductances L11 and L22 of inductors 1 and 2, respectively, are
given by
