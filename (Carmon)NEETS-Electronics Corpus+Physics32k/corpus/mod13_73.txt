Thus, in subtraction the minuend is always found in array Z and the subtrahend in either row X or
column Y. If the subtrahend is in row X, then the remainder will be in column Y. Conversely, if the
subtrahend is in column Y, then the difference will be in row X. For example, to subtract 8 from 15, find
8 in either the X row or Y column. Find where this row or column intersects with a value of 15 for Z; then
move to the remaining row or column to find the difference.
