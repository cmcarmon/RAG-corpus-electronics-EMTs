To minimize the latency caused by copying into and out of buffers, the IBM I/O system uses little buffering
between  the  device  and  memory.1  In  a  high-performance  environment,  devices  spend  a  good  deal  of  time
waiting for the pathway’s resources to become free. These resources are used for time periods related to disk
transfer  speeds,  measured  in  milliseconds.  One  possible  method  for  improving  utilization  is  to  support  dis-
connect/reconnect. A subchannel can connect to a device, issue a seek, disconnect to free the channel path for
other requests, and reconnect later to perform the transfer when the seek is completed. Unfortunately, not all
reconnects can be serviced immediately, because the control units are busy servicing other devices. These RPS
misses (to be described in more detail in the next section) are a major source of delay in heavily utilized IBM
storage subsystems [Buzen and Shum, 1987]. Performance can be further improved by providing multiple paths
between  memory  and  devices.  To  this  purpose,  IBM’s  high-end  systems  support  dynamic  path  reconnect,  a
