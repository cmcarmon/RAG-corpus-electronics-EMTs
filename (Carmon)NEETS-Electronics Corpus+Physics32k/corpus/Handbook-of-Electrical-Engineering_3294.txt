The output power is usually speciﬁed in milliwatts per milliamp current obtained in a given measurement
situation,  e.g.,  into  a  ﬁber  or  with  a  0.5  numerical  aperture  large  area  detector.  Other  parameters  are  peak
wavelength, wavelength band (usually full width half max), and temperature characteristics.
