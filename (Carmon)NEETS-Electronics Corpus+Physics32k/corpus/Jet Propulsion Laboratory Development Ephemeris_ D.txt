Because the ephemeris is a tabulation at regularly-spaced time intervals, interpolation would be necessary if coordinates for non-tabulated times were desired. The ephemeris data are distributed in the form of a file of numerical coefficients for Chebyshev polynomials. The polynomials are curves fit to the tabulated coordinates over a range of dates; solving the polynomials allows recovery (calculation) of the positions, velocities and accelerations throughout the range of dates directly, interpolation occurring automatically with the use of the time argument. The file consists of coefficients covering a number of intervals of time, enough intervals to span the dates covered by the original numerical integration. The ephemerides are now available via World Wide Web and FTP in the form of data files containing the Chebyshev coefficients, along with source code to recover positions and velocities.
Evaluation of the Chebyshev polynomials can recover planetary and lunar coordinates to high precision relative to the original numerical integration. DE405 recovery for the inner planets is about 0.001 arcseconds (equivalent to about 1 km at the distance of Mars); for the outer planets it is generally about 0.1 arcseconds. The 'reduced accuracy' DE406 ephemeris gives an interpolating precision (relative to the full ephemeris values) no worse than 25 metres for any planet and no worse than 1 metre for the moon.
Note that these precision numbers are for the interpolated values relative original tabulated coordinates. The overall precision and accuracy of interpolated values for describing the actual motions of the planets will be a function of both the precision of the ephemeris tabulated coordinates and the precision of the interpolation.
