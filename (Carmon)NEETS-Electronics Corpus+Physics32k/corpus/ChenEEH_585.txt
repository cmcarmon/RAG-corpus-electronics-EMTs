The resistance of low-voltage MOSFETs is dominated by the
resistance of the channel and neck regions. Higher voltage
MOSFETs, however, have thicker drift regions with low
doping. The resistance is then dominated by the drift region.
This limits the application of MOSFETs at higher voltage
levels. The Iâ€“V characteristics of the power MOSFET are
shown in Figure 7.12(B). Increasing the gate voltage raises
the saturation current level as given by:
