The handbook stresses fundamental theory behind profes-
sional applications. In order to do so, it is reinforced with
frequent examples. Extensive development of
theory and
details of proofs have been omitted. The reader is assumed to
have a certain degree of sophistication and experience. How-
ever, brief reviews of theories, principles, and mathematics of
some subject areas are given. These reviews have been done
concisely with perception. The handbook is not a textbook
replacement, but rather a reinforcement and reminder of ma-
terial learned as a student. Therefore, important advancement
and traditional as well as innovative practices are included.
