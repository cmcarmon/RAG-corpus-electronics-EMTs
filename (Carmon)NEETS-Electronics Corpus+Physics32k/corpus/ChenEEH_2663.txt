To achieve an efﬁcient solution through iteration, it is crit-
ical to reduce the number of iterations and/or to reduce the
operation count for computing the matrix–vector product.
The ﬁrst can be achieved by preconditioning, and the second
can be achieved by using fast Fourier transform (Borup and
Gandhi, 1984; Zwamborn and van der Berg, 1994; Gan and
Chew, 1995; Wang and Jin, 1988), the adaptive integral
method (Wang et al., 1988), the fast multipole method
(Rokhlin, 1990; Coifman et al., 1993; Lu and Chew, 1993),
and the multilevel fast multipole algorithm (Song and Chew,
1993; Dembart and Yip, 1995; Song et al., 1997).
