You have probably already realized that the negative bias also reduces plate current flow. (Negative
charge on grid-less plate current, right?) The trick here is for the circuit designer to choose a bias and an
input signal that, when added together, do not allow the grid to become positive nor to become negative
enough to stop plate current.
