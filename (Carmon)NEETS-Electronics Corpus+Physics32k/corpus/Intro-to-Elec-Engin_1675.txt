Noting that the denominator of Equation (13) is the same as the left side of Equation (7),
it follows that the damping ratio and the natural frequency will have the same values as
found in part (b). The oscillatory dynamic behavior can be described with the two ﬁgures
of merit ξ and ωn, along with percent maximum overshoot and settling time.
