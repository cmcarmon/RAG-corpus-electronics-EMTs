Berenger (1994) provided the seminal insight that a non-
physical PML could be implemented at the outer boundary of
an FDTD grid to completely absorb outgoing waves regardless
of their frequency, angle of incidence, and polarization. The key
was to exploit additional degrees of freedom arising from a
novel split-ﬁeld formulation of Maxwell’s equations. Here,
each ﬁeld vector component is split into two orthogonal com-
ponents, and the 12 resulting ﬁeld components are expressed as
satisfying two coupled ﬁrst-order partial differential equations.
By choosing loss parameters consistent with a dispersionless
medium, a perfectly matched planar interface is derived.
