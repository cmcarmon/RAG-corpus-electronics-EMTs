Note how that at any given point in time, the capacitor’s current is proportional to the rate-
of-change, or slope of the capacitor’s voltage plot. When the voltage plot line is rising quickly
(steep slope), the current will likewise be great. Where the voltage plot has a mild slope, the
current is small. At one place in the voltage plot where it levels off (zero slope, representing a
period of time when the potentiometer wasn’t moving), the current falls to zero.
