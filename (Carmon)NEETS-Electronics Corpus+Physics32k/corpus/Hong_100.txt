The internal circuitry in an op amp is designed to give two basic characteristics: 
(1) very high impedance at the input terminals, and (2) very high differential gain from 
the input to the output. In fact, an ideal op amp has infinite input impedance and infinite 
differential  gain.  For  practical  op  amps,  the  differential  gain  exceeds  105  and  input
