The drag equation may be derived to within a multiplicative constant by the method of dimensional analysis. If a moving fluid meets an object, it exerts a force on the object. Suppose that the variables involved – under some conditions – are the:
speed u,
fluid density ρ,
viscosity ν of the fluid,
size of the body, expressed in terms of its frontal area A, and
drag force FD.
Using the algorithm of the Buckingham π theorem, these five variables can be reduced to two dimensionless parameters:
drag coefficient CD and
Reynolds number Re.
Alternatively, the dimensionless parameters via direct manipulation of the variables.
That this is so becomes apparent when the drag force FD is expressed as part of a function of the other variables in the problem:





f

,

u
,

A
,

ρ
,

ν
)

=

0.



{\displaystyle f_{a}(F_{D},\,u,\,A,\,\rho ,\,\nu )\,=\,0.\,}

This rather odd form of expression is used because it does not assume a one-to-one relationship. Here, fa is some (as-yet-unknown) function that takes five arguments. Now the right-hand side is zero in any system of units; so it should be possible to express the relationship described by fa in terms of only dimensionless groups.
There are many ways of combining the five arguments of fa to form dimensionless groups, but the Buckingham π theorem states that there will be two such groups. The most appropriate are the Reynolds number, given by

ν




{\displaystyle \mathrm {Re} \,=\,{\frac {u\,{\sqrt {A}}}{\nu }}}

and the drag coefficient, given by

.


{\displaystyle C_{D}\,=\,{\frac {F_{D}}{{\frac {1}{2}}\,\rho \,A\,u^{2}}}.}

Thus the function of five variables may be replaced by another function of only two variables:

=

{\displaystyle f_{b}\left({\frac {F_{D}}{{\frac {1}{2}}\,\rho \,A\,u^{2}}},\,{\frac {u\,{\sqrt {A}}}{\nu }}\right)\,=\,0.}

where fb is some function of two arguments. The original law is then reduced to a law involving only these two numbers.
Because the only unknown in the above equation is the drag force FD, it is possible to express it as







F

ρ

(

{\displaystyle {\frac {F_{D}}{{\frac {1}{2}}\,\rho \,A\,u^{2}}}\,=\,f_{c}\left({\frac {u\,{\sqrt {A}}}{\nu }}\right)}

or

{\displaystyle F_{D}\,=\,{\tfrac {1}{2}}\,\rho \,A\,u^{2}\,f_{c}(R_{e}),\,}
and with




C

D



=

c


(

)
.


{\displaystyle C_{D}\,=\,f_{c}(R_{e}).}

Thus the force is simply ½ ρ A u2 times some (as-yet-unknown) function fc of the Reynolds number Re – a considerably simpler system than the original five-argument function given above.
Dimensional analysis thus makes a very complex problem (trying to determine the behavior of a function of five variables) a much simpler one: the determination of the drag as a function of only one variable, the Reynolds number.
The analysis also gives other information for free, so to speak. The analysis shows that, other things being equal, the drag force will be proportional to the density of the fluid. This kind of information often proves to be extremely valuable, especially in the early stages of a research project.
