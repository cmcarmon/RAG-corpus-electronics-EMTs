Oskar Klein and Walter Gordon proposed the Kleinâ€“Gordon equation to describe quantum particles in the framework of relativity. Another important contribution by Gordon was to the theory of the Dirac equation, where he introduced the Gordon Decomposition of the current into its center of mass and spin contributions, and so helped explain the
