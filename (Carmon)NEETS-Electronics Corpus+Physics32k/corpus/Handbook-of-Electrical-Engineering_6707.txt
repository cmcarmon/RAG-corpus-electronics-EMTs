The motivation for FPNs is that since link transmission is becoming more reliable, extensive error checking
and ﬂow control are not needed across individual links; an end-to-end check should be sufﬁcient. Meanwhile,
the savings in processing due to not processing at the network layer can be applied to frame processing, which
allows interconnection of the switches at higher line speeds.
