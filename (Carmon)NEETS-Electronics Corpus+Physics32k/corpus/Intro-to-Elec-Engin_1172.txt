In the steady-state theory of the synchronous machine, with known terminal bus voltage Vt
and a given synchronous reactance Xs, the six operating variables are P, Q, δ, φ, Ia, and Ef. The
synchronous machine is said to have two degrees of freedom, because the selection of any two,
such as φ and Ia, P and Q, or δ and Ef, determines the operating point and establishes the other
four quantities.
