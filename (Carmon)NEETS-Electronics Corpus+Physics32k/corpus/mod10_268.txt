The ground wave is actually composed of two separate component waves. These are known as the 
SURFACE WAVE and the SPACE WAVE (fig. 2-11). The determining factor in whether a ground wave 
component is classified as a space wave or a surface wave is simple. A surface wave travels along the 
surface of the Earth. A space wave travels over the surface.
