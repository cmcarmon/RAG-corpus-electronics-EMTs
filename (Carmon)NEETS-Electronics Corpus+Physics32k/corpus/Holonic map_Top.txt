A holonic map is a fractal map of perceptions represented as holons, forming a holarchy of perceptual information. Within a holonic map each object of perception, colloquially referred to as a 'thought' or a 'thing', is represented by a holon, which can contain other holons.
The holonic map is able to store and communicate subjective and inter-subjective information, and therefore by function of the human nervous system abstractions of 'objective' information. Any perceptual object of attention can potentially be represented as a holon within a holonic map.
