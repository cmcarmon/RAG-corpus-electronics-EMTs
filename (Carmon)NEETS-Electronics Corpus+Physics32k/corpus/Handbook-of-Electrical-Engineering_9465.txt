In the past, ﬁle processing techniques were used to design information systems. These systems usually consist
of a set of ﬁles and a collection of application programs. Permanent records are stored in the ﬁles, and application
programs are used to update and query the ﬁles. The application programs were in general developed individ-
ually to meet the needs of different groups of users. In many cases, this approach leads to a duplication of data
among the ﬁles of different users. Also, the lack of coordination between ﬁles belonging to different users often
leads to a lack of data consistency. In addition, changes to the underlying data requirements usually necessitate
major changes to existing application programs. Among other major problems that arise with the use of ﬁle
processing  techniques  are  lack  of  data  sharing,  reduced  programming  productivity,  and  increased  program
maintenance. Because of their inherent difﬁculties and lack of ﬂexibility, ﬁle processing techniques have lost a
great deal of their popularity and are being replaced by
