So how much current does it take to hurt the average human being? Not 
much. Table 13-1 summarizes some estimates of just how much — or how 
little — DC and 60‐Hz (hertz) AC current it takes to affect the human body. 
Remember that a milliamp (mA) is one one‐thousandth of an amp (or 0.001 A). 
Please note that these are estimates (no one has performed experiments on 
real humans to derive these figures), and that each person is affected differ-
ently depending on age, body chemistry, health status, and other factors.
