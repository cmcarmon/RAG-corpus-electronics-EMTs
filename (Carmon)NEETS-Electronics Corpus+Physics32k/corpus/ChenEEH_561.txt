Away from the junction in the drift region, current ﬂow is
dominated by majority carriers under the inﬂuence of an
electric ﬁeld. This causes a resistive voltage drop. During on-
state current ﬂow, when injected minority carrier density
exceeds background doping concentration, the device is said
to be conducting in high-level injection. The current ﬂow in
high-level injection is given by:
