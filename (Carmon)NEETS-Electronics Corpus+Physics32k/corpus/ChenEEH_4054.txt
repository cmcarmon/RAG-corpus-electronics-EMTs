A random process X(t) is said to be stationary in the strict
sense if none of its statistics is affected by a shift in time origin.
A random process is said to be wide-sense stationary (WSS) if
two of its statistics (mean and autocorrelation function) do
not vary with shift in time origin. Therefore, a random process
is WSS if:
