Figure 6.44 shows a situation similar to that in Figure 5.7, but for concreteness,
replaces the first logic gate with an inverter I and the second with a buffer B.
Like the inverter, the buffer has a single input and a single output. It performs
the identity function, that is it simply copies the input value to its output. This
time around, we will focus on the conditions at the buffer. Assume that both
our logic gates adhere to a static discipline with the following voltage levels:
