Pack slip happens when the tape is loosely wound on the reel and is exposed to excessive vibration
or too much heat. This causes the tape to shift (side-to-side), causing steps in the tape pack. When a tape
reel with pack slip is used, the magnetic tape will unwind unevenly and rub against the sides of the tape
reel or the recorderâ€™s tape guides. This can damage the magnetic tape and cause oxide shedding. Figure
2-3 shows an example of pack slip.
