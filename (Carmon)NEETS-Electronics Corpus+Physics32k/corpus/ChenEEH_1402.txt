One feature of DISC is that the instructions are intercon-
nected using a ﬁxed bus structure. Luk, Shirazi, and Cheung
also proposed methods (1996) and tools (1998, 2000) for run-
time reconﬁgurable designs. An advantage of their approach is
that the reconﬁgurable designs produced are not conﬁned to a
speciﬁc bus structure.
