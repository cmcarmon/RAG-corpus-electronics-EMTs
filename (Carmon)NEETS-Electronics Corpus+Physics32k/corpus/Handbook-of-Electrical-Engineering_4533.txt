Can use either subdomain or entire-domain bases. 
Use of latter is generally conﬁned to bodies of 
rotation. Former is usually of low order, with 
piecewise linear or sinusoidal being the maximum 
variation used.
Pointwise matching is commonly employed, using 
a delta function. For wires, pulse, linear, and 
sinusoidal testing is also used. Linear and 
sinusoidal testing is also used for surfaces.
Sampling needed depends on the nature of the 
integral operator L(s,s¢). An important 
consideration whenever the ﬁeld integrals cannot 
be evaluated in closed form.
