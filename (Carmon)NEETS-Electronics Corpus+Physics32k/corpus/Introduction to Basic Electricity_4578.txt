Figure 45-4 shows the 10 NAND gates required 
for decoding a 4-bit BCD number to its approximate 
output (one decimal digit). When all the inputs to a 
NAND gate are 1, its output is 0. All other outputs 
from the NAND gates in the decoder are 1s. Rather 
than draw all the logic gates each time the circuit is 
used, the symbol shown in Figure 45-5 is used.
