While most mechanical meter movements are based on electromagnetism (electron ﬂow
through a conductor creating a perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld), a few are based on electrostatics:
that is, the attractive or repulsive force generated by electric charges across space. This is
the same phenomenon exhibited by certain materials (such as wax and wool) when rubbed
together. If a voltage is applied between two conductive surfaces across an air gap, there will be
a physical force attracting the two surfaces together capable of moving some kind of indicating
mechanism. That physical force is directly proportional to the voltage applied between the
plates, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the plates. The force
is also irrespective of polarity, making this a polarity-insensitive type of meter movement:
