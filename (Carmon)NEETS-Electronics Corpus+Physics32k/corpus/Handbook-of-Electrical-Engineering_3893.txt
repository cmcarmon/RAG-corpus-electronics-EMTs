The constant path length and high gain make the parabolic antenna popular at many wavelengths including
microwave  and  visible.  More  than  one  reﬂecting  surface  is  allowed  in  the  design.  The  surfaces  are  typically
conical  sections  and  may  be  designed  to  reduce  a  particular  distortion  or  to  provide  better  functionality.
Compound designs often allow the active elements to be more accessible and eliminate long transmission lines.
A two-bounce reﬂector with a parabolic primary and a hyperbolic secondary is known as a Cassegrain system.
In all reﬂector systems it is important to account for the blockage (“shadow” of the feed, secondary reﬂector,
and support structures) as well as the spillover (radiation propagating past the intended reﬂecting surface).
