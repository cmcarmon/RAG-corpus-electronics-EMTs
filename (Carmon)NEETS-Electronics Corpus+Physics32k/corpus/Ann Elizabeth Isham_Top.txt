Ann Elizabeth Isham (January 25, 1862 â€“ April 15, 1912) was a passenger aboard the RMS Titanic. She was one of four female first-class passengers to die when the ship sunk. Her death was probably due in part because she did not want to leave behind her Great Dane; a woman was reportedly sighted in the water with her arms frozen around a dog.
