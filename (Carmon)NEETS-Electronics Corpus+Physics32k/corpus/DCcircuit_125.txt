To be able to make meaningful statements about these quantities in circuits, we need to be
able to describe their quantities in the same way that we might quantify mass, temperature,
volume, length, or any other kind of physical quantity. For mass we might use the units of
”kilogram” or ”gram.” For temperature we might use degrees Fahrenheit or degrees Celsius.
Here are the standard units of measurement for electrical current, voltage, and resistance:
