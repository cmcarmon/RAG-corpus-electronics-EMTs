The second-generation ﬁxed-point processor TMS32020, introduced in 1985 by TI, was quickly followed by
an improved C-MOS version TMS320C25 [Chassaing and Horning, 1990] in 1986. Features of the TMS320C25
include 544 (16-bit) words of on-chip data RAM, separate program and data memory spaces (each 64 K words),
and an instruction cycle time of 100 ns, enabling the TMS320C25 to execute 10 MIPS. A faster version, TI’s
ﬁxed-point TMS320C50 processor, is available with an instruction cycle time of 35 ns.
