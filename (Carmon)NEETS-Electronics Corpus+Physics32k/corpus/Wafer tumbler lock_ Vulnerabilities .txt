Most wafer tumbler locks with low tolerances can be opened with a set of jigglers or try-out keys (see picture on right). These sets of keys are designed with the most common patterns of key available. The key is inserted into the lock like a normal key, and a turning force is applied whilst the key is rocked back and forth until the lock opens.
