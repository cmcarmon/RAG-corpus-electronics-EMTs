A rate gyro (sometimes called a rate-of-turn gyro) consists of a spinning rotor mounted in a single 
gimbal, as shown in figure 3-13. A gyro mounted in this manner has one degree of freedom; that is, it is 
free to tilt in only one direction. The rotor in a rate gyro is restrained from precessing by some means, 
usually a spring arrangement. This is done to limit precession and to return the rotor to a neutral position 
when there is no angular change taking place. Remember, the amount of precession of a gyro is 
proportional to the force that causes the precession.
