The right hand rule is in widespread use in physics. A list of physical quantities whose directions are related by the right-hand rule is given below. (Some of these are related only indirectly to cross products, and use the second form.)
For a rotating object, if the right-hand fingers follow the curve of a point on the object, then the thumb points along the axis of rotation in the direction of the angular velocity vector.
A torque, the force that causes it, and the position of the point of application of the force.
A magnetic field, the position of the point where it is determined, and the electric current (or change in electric flux) that causes it.
A magnetic field in a coil of wire and the electric current in the wire.
The force of a magnetic field on a charged particle, the magnetic field itself, and the velocity of the object.
The vorticity at any point in the field of flow of a fluid.
The induced current from motion in a magnetic field (known as Fleming's right-hand rule).
The x, y and z unit vectors in a Cartesian coordinate system can be chosen to follow the right-hand rule. Right-handed coordinate systems are often used in rigid body and kinematics.
