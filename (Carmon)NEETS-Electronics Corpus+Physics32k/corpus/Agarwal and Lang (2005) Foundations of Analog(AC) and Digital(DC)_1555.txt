(Hint: The total delay from the input of INV A to the output of INV B is the sum
of the following two quantities: (1) the propagation delay of INV A driving the wire
segment of length l/2 and a capacitance CGS corresponding to the gate capacitance
of the buffer, and (2) the propagation delay of the buffer driving the second wire
segment of length l/2 and a capacitance CGS corresponding to the gate capacitance
of INV B. Remember, the buffer has zero delay when it is driving zero output
capacitance.)
Figure 10.103 shows a circuit in which nâˆ’ 1 buffers are introduced between INV A
and INV B. INV A and each of the buffers drives a segment of wire of length l/n.
Compute the propagation delay between the input of INV A and the input of INV B
for this case.
