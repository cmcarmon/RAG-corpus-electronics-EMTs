The  bandwidth  of  an  amplifier  is  usually  taken  as 
the difference between the upper and lower cut-off 
frequencies (i.e. f2 I f1 in Figs 7.10 and 7.11). The 
bandwidth  of  an  amplifier  must  be  sufficient  to 
accommodate  the  range  of  frequencies  present 
within  the  signals  that  it  is  to  be  presented  with.
