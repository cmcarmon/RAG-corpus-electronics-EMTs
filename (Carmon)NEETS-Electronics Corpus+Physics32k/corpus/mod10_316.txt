Normally, the major loss of energy is because of the spreading out of the wavefront as it travels away 
from the transmitter. As the distance increases, the area of the wavefront spreads out, much like the beam 
of a flashlight. This means the amount of energy contained within any unit of area on the wavefront will 
decrease as distance increases. By the time the energy arrives at the receiving antenna, the wavefront is so 
spread out that the receiving antenna extends into only a very small fraction of the wavefront. This is 
illustrated in figure 2-22.
