amount consumed. An important advantage of the SALICIDE
process is that the entire junction area up to the sidewall spacer
is used for contact formation, which translates into low contact
resistance. The channel doping proﬁle typically consists of the
threshold adjust and punchthrough stop implants. The gate
electrode is very heavily doped to avoid polysilicon depletion.
The MOSFET continues to maintain its dominance in
today’s digital
from
MOSFET scaling, several structural and material changes are
required. These include new gate dielectric materials to reach
equivalent SiO2 thicknesses less than 1 nm, new doping tech-
nologies that provide ultra-low resistance and ultra-shallow
junctions, as well as metal gate electrodes that do not suffer
from depletion effects.
