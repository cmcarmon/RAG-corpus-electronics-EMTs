Example: The variable resistor in the circuit in ﬁgure 6.21 provides a DC oﬀset
to the output voltage; a circuit of this type is often used to provide a zero output
for some speciﬁc but nonzero input signal. What range of input voltage V0 can
be zeroed out by this circuit?
The current ﬂowing from the input to the output is
