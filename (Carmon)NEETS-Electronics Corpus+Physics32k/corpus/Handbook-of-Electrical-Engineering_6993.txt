6. Trigonometric polynomials. All periodic bandlimited signals can be expressed as trigonometric poly-
nomials (i.e., a Fourier series with a Ô¨Ånite number of terms). If the series has M terms, then the signal
has M degrees of freedom which can be determined from M samples taken within a single period.
