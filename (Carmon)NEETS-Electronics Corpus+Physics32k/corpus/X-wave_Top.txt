In physics, X-waves are localized solutions of the wave equation that travel at a constant velocity in a given direction. X-waves can be sound, electromagnetic, or gravitational waves. They are built as a non-monochromatic superposition of Bessel beams. Ideal X-waves carry infinite energy, but finite-energy realizations have been observed in various frameworks. Electromagnetic X-waves travel faster than the speed of light, and X-wave pulses can have superluminal phase and group velocity.
In optics, X-waves solution have been reported within a quantum mechanical formulation.
