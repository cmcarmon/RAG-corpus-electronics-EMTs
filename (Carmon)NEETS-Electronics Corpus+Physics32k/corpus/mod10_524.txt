A nonresonant line is either infinitely long or terminated in its characteristic impedance. Since no
reflections occur, all the energy traveling down the line is absorbed by the load which terminates the line.
Since no standing waves are present, this type of line is sometimes spoken of as a FLAT line. In addition,
because the load impedance of such a line is equal to Z0, no special tuning devices are required to effect a
maximum power transfer; hence, the line is also called an UNTUNED line.
