Q is really very simple to understand if you think back to the tuned-circuit principles just covered. 
Inductance and capacitance are in all tuners. Resistance is an impurity that causes losses. Therefore, 
components that provide the reactance with a minimum of resistance are "purer" (more perfect) than those 
with higher resistance. The actual measure of this purity, merit, or quality must include the two basic 
quantities, X and R.
