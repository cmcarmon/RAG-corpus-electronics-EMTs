The problem of two fixed centers conserves energy; in other words, the total energy E is a constant of motion. The potential energy is given by

{\displaystyle V(\mathbf {r} )=-{\frac {\mu _{1}}{r_{1}}}-{\frac {\mu _{2}}{r_{2}}}}

where r represents the particle's position, and r1 and r2 are the distances between the particle and the centers of force; μ1 and μ2 are constants that measure the strength of the first and second forces, respectively. The total energy equals sum of this potential energy with the particle's kinetic energy

{\displaystyle E={\frac {1}{2m}}\left|\mathbf {p} \right|^{2}+V(\mathbf {r} )}

where m and p are the particle's mass and linear momentum, respectively.
The particle's linear and angular momentum are not conserved in Euler's problem, since the two centers of force act like external forces upon the particle, which may yield a net force and torque on the particle. Nevertheless, Euler's problem has a second constant of motion

where 2a is the separation of the two centers of force, θ1 and θ2 are the angles of the lines connecting the particle to the centers of force, with respect to the line connecting the centers. This second constant of motion was identified by E. T. Whittaker in his work on analytical mechanics, and generalized to n dimensions by Coulson and Joseph in 1967. In the Coulson–Joseph form, the constant of motion is written

{\displaystyle B=\left|\mathbf {L} \right|^{2}+a^{2}\left|\mathbf {p} \right|^{2}-2a\left[\mu _{1}\cos \theta _{1}+\mu _{2}\cos \theta _{2}\right]}

This constant of motion corresponds to the total angular momentum |L|2 in the limit when the two centers of force converge to a single point (a → 0), and proportional to the Laplace–Runge–Lenz vector A in the limit when one of the centers goes to infinity (a → ∞ while x − a remains finite).
