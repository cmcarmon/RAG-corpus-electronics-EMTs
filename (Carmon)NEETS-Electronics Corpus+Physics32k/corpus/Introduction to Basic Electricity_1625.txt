surface-mount	resistors are ideal for small cir‑
cuit applications. A thin film of carbon or metal alloy 
is deposited on a ceramic base or substrate. Contact 
from the resistive element to the printed circuit board 
is via metal end caps, or terminals, resulting in zero 
lead length. In application, these end caps are soldered 
directly to the circuit board conductive trace using an 
automated soldering process. The lack of long leads 
to solder into the printed circuit board yields several 
advantages. Among them are lightweight, smaller 
printed circuit board sizes and the use of automated 
assembly processes. Surface‑mount resistors are avail‑
able in both thick and thin films. They are available 
from 0 ohms to 10 megohms at tolerance of 65%
