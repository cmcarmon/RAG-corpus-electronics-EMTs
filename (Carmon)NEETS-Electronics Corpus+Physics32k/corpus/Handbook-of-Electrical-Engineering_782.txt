The magnitude response functions of the three-pole Butterworth ﬁlter and the three-pole type 1 Chebyshev
ﬁlter are compared in Fig. 10.8 with the 3-dB bandwidth of both ﬁlters equal to 2 rad. Note that the transition
from passband to stopband is sharper in the Chebyshev ﬁlter; however, the Chebyshev ﬁlter does have the 3-
dB ripple over the passband.
