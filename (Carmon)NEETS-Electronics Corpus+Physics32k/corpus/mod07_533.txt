You may already know how a transformer functions to increase or decrease voltages. You may also 
have learned that a transformer secondary may provide one or several ac voltage outputs which may be 
greater or less than the input voltage. When voltages are stepped up, current is decreased; when voltages 
are stepped down, current is increased.
