The SR model is a better approximation of MOSFET behavior than the
S model. In fact, it is easy to see that the SR model reduces to the S model if
RON is zero. However, the SR model still is a gross simplification of MOSFET
behavior. In particular, although the MOSFET displays resistive behavior when
vDS (cid:2) vGS − VT, the resistance RON is not fixed. Rather, it is a function of
vGS. Furthermore, when vDS is comparable to, or greater than, vGS − VT, the
drain-to-source behavior is not resistive at all, rather it is that of a current source.
However, the fixed resistance model is much simpler and suffices for analyzing
some aspects of digital circuits because the gate voltage is bimodal
low or
high. When the voltage is low, the MOSFET turns off, and when the voltage
is high, the drain-source connection offers a resistance RON related to the gate
voltage. Since there is only one value for the gate voltage when the input is high
(for example VS), and accordingly, one value for the resistance RON, we can
use this value for RON in our model. In summary, the SR model is valid only
when vDS (cid:2) vGS − VT, and when there is only one value for the gate voltage
when the input is high (for example vGS = VS). Chapter 7 will discuss more
comprehensive models for the MOSFET that are valid across a wider range of
values for vGS and vDS.
