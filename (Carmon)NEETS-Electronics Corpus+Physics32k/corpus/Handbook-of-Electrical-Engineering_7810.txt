The latency is half the revolution period of the disk, since a randomly selected sector is, on the average, halfway
along the track from the point where the head initially lands. Thus for a disk rotating at 1200 rpm tl = 25 ms,
while at 3600 rpm tl  . 8.3 ms. The seek time, on the other hand, is independent of the rotation speed, but is
determined by the traveling distance of the head during an average seek, as well as by the mechanism of head
actuation. It can be shown that the average length of travel in a random seek is one third of the full stroke. (In
our notation the full stroke is rmax â€“ rmin.) In magnetic disk drives where the head/actuator assembly is relatively
light-weight  (a  typical Winchester  head  weighs  about  5  grams)  the  acceleration  and  deceleration  periods  are
short, and seek times are typically around 10 ms in small drives (i.e., 5.25 and 3.5 in.). In optical disk systems,
