electronic components in circuit. It can be made easily and cheaply using parts from the supply system. 
Figure 1-42 is a schematic of an octopus that uses either a 6.3-volt filament transformer or an audio 
oscillator for input power. The benefits of in circuit  troubleshooting with an octopus are (1) reduced 
maintenance time, (2) less chance of damage from soldering-iron heat, and (3) a visual display of the 
component's condition.
