This list of Solar System objects most distant from the Sun in 2015 is a list of bodies orbiting the Sun by their approximate distance from the Sun in the Earth year 2015 (as opposed to those with the greatest calculated aphelion in their orbit), and discovered by that year. An exception is made for objects announced later but found by 2015, but other objects would be reported elsewhere. The meaning of in 2015 for this list, means most distant objects known in that year of that year without precovered objects; e.g. an historical list.
V774104 was announced in November 2015. It was heralded by many news outlets as "the most distant Solar System object", surpassing Eris (not counting space probes and long-period comets).
Another very distant body is Sedna, discovered in November 2003. Although it takes over 10,000 years to orbit, it will slowly get closer over the next 60 years to its perihelion.
Because all these objects are moving, the list changes significantly over time. In particular, some objects are in-bound and some are out-bound. It is hard to see comets at the longer distances. It is usually their big comas that allow them to be detected more easily when they get heated by the Sun.
