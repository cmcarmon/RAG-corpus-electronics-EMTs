electrical energy out of it.
Large capacitors can retain a charge for long periods of time — even 
after you remove power.
To discharge a capacitor, you short out its terminals through an insu-
lated bleeder jumper (as shown in Figure 16-11), which is simply a wire 
with a large (1 MΩ or 2 MΩ) resistor attached. The resistor prevents the 
capacitor from shorting out, which would make it unusable.
