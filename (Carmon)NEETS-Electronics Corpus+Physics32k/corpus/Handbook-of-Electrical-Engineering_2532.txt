Example 2
Using the biasing values for R1, R2, and RE already obtained in Example 1, calculate the value of RC to give a
terminal voltage gain of –150. Then determine the input resistance Rin if hfe for the transistor is 10% higher
than hFE.
Solution. Because IQ = 1 mA, gm . 3921 = 39 mA/V. Hence Av . –gmRC or –150 . –39 R C, giving
