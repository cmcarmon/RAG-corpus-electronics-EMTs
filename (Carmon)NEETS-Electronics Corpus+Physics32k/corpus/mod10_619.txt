In some overland communications, such as in vehicular installations, antenna heights are limited to 3 
meters (10 feet) or less. In such instances vertical polarization results in a stronger receiver signal than 
does horizontal polarization at frequencies up to about 50 megahertz. From approximately 50 to 100 
megahertz, vertical polarization results in a slightly stronger signal than does horizontal polarization with 
antennas at the same height. Above 100 megahertz, the difference in signal strength is negligible.
