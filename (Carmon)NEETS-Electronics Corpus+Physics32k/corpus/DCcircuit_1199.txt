If the load in the above circuit will not tolerate less than 220 volts, given a source voltage
of 230 volts, then we’d better be sure that the wiring doesn’t drop more than 10 volts along the
way. Counting both the supply and return conductors of this circuit, this leaves a maximum
tolerable drop of 5 volts along the length of each wire. Using Ohm’s Law (R=E/I), we can
determine the maximum allowable resistance for each piece of wire:
