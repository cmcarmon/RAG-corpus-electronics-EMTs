GRW says that particles can undergo spontaneous wave-function collapses. For individual particles, these collapses happen probabilistically and will occur at a given rate with high probability but not with certainty; groups of particles behave in a statistically regular way, however. Since experimental physics has not already detected an unexpected spontaneous collapse, it can be argued that GRW collapses happen extremely rarely. Giancarlo Ghirardi, Alberto Rimini, and Tullio Weber suggest that the rate of spontaneous collapse for an individual particle is on the order of once every hundred million years.
