Step 3 is the same as step 2, except that we are getting the width encroachment instead of the length.
In Step 1 the value of THETA that ﬁts the high Vg s  portion of the wide-long device linear region curve was
found. Because the channel length of a long transistor is very large, the source and drain series resistances have
almost no effect here, but for a short-channel device, the series resistance will also affect the high Vg s  portion
of the linear region curve. Therefore, in step 4 we ﬁx THETA from step 1 and use RS and RD to ﬁt the wide-
short device in the linear region, high Vg s  portion of the curve.
