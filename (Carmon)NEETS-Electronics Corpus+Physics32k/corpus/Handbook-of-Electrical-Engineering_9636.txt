Operating  systems  are  large,  complex  pieces  of  software.  They  must  handle  asynchronous  events  such  as
interrupts  from  I/O  devices,  control  hardware  memory  management  units  (MMUs)  to  implement  virtual
memory,  support  multiple  simultaneous  users,  implement  complex  network  protocols,  and  much  more.  As
with any software of this magnitude, an operating system is logically divided into smaller pieces. The structure
of a typical modern operating system is depicted in Fig. 96.4.
