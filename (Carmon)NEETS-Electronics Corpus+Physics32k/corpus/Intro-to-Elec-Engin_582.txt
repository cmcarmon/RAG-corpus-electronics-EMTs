Organization
There are two principal components: hardware and software. The former refers to physical
components such as memory unit (MU), arithmetic and logic unit (ALU), control unit (CU),
input/output (I/O) devices, etc.; whereas the latter refers to the programs (collections of ordered
instructions) that direct the hardware operations.
