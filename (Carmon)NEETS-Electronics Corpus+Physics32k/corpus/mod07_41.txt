As the applications of solid-state devices mount, the need for knowledge of these devices becomes
increasingly important. Personnel in the Navy today will have to understand solid-state devices if they are
to become proficient in the repair and maintenance of electronic equipment. Therefore, our objective in
this module is to provide a broad coverage of solid-state devices and, as a broad application, power
supplies. We will begin our discussion with some background information on the development of the
semiconductor. We will then proceed to the semiconductor diode, the transistor, special devices and,
finally, solid-state power supplies.
