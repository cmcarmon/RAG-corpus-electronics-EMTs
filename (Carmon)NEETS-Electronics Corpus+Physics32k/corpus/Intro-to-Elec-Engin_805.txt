When blockage occurs to the biological signals that stimulate the heart to beat, the application
of electric pacemaker pulses forcing the heart to beat at a higher rate is very helpful. A demand
pacemaker is particularly helpful to the patient with partial blockage, in which case an electric
pulse to the heart muscle is only applied when a beat does not occur within a predetermined time
interval.
