The above equations are written in SI units (short SI) suppressing that the unit D (darcy) for the absolute permeability is defined in non-SI units. That is way there are no unit-related constants. The petroleum industry don't use the SI units. Instead they use a special version of SI units that we will call Applied SI units, or they use another set of units called Field units which has its origin from USA and UK. Temperature is not included in the equations, so we can use the factor-label method (also called unit-factor method) which says that if we have a variable/parameter with unit H, we multiply this variable/parameter by a conversion constant C and then the variable gets the unit G that we want. This means that we apply the transformation H*C = G, and the non-SI effect of the definition of permeability is included in the conversion factor C for permeability. The transformation H*C = G apply for every spatial dimension so we concentrate on the main terms, neglecting the signs, and then complete the parenthesis with the gravity term. Before we start conversion, we notice that both the original (single phase) the flow equation of Darcy and the generalized (or extended) multiphase flow equations of Muskat et al. are using reservoir velocity (volume flux), volume rate and densities. The units of these quantities are given a prefix r (or R) in order to distinguish them from their counterparts at standard surface conditions which gets a prefix s (or S). This is especially important when we convert the equations to Field units. The reason for going into details in the seemingly simple topic of unit conversion, is that many people make mistakes when doing unit conversions.
Now we are ready to start the conversion work. First we take the flux version of the equation and rewrite it as

{\displaystyle 1={\frac {K\nabla _{\gamma }P_{a}}{\mu _{a}u{_{a}}}}}
where a = w, o, g
We want to place the composite conversion factor together with the permeability parameter. Here we note that our equation is written in SI units, and that the group of variables/parameters (hereafter called parameters for short) on the right hand side constitute a dimensionless group. Now we convert each parameter and collect these conversions into a single conversion constant. Now we note that our list with conversion constants (the C's) goes from applied unit to SI units, and this very common for such conversion lists. We therefore assume that our parameters are entered in applied units and convert them (back) to SI units.

where a = w, o, g
Notice that we have removed relative permeability which is a dimensionless parameter. This composite conversion factor is called Darcy's constant for the flux formulated equation, and it is

Since our parameter group is dimensionless in base SI units, we don't need to include the SI units in the units for our composite conversion factor as you can see in the second table. Next we take the rate version of the equation and rewrite it as

The pressure gradient and the gravity term are identical for the flux and the rate equations, and will therefore be discussed only once. The task here is to have a gravity term that is consistent with the applied units ("H-units") for the pressure gradient. We must therefore place our conversion factor together with the gravity parameters. We write "the parenthesis" in SI units as

This is it for the analytical equations, but when the programmer transform the flow equation into a finite difference equation and further into a numerical algorithm, they are eager to minimize the number of computational operations. Here is an example with two constants that can be reduced to one by the fusion

Conversion of units is a fairly rare activity, even for technical professionals, but that is also the reason why people forget how to do it correctly.
