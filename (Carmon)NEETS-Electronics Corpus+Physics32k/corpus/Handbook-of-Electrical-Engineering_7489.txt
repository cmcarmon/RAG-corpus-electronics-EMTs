Semi-analytic simulation: A numerical analysis technique that can be used to efﬁciently determine the symbol
error rate of digital communication systems. It can be applied whenever one can analytically determine
the probability of demodulation error given a particular transmitted data pattern. Although this technique
can  only  be  applied  to  a  restricted  class  of  systems,  in  these  cases  it  is  far  more  efﬁcient,  in  terms  of
computer execution time, than Monte Carlo simulations.
