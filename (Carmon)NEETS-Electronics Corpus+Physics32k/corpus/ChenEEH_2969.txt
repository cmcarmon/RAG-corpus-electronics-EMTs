High Electron Mobility Transistor
Also known as a modulation-doped Ô¨Åeld effect transistor
(MODFET), the high electron mobility transistor (HEMT)
structure is similar to that of a typical MOSFET, with the
difference being the inclusion of a heterojunction formed by
growing an additional layer of AlGaAs under the gate contact,
as shown in Figure 11.7. This results in very high electron
mobilities and consequently much higher fT and fmax for a
given feature size. HEMT devices typically exhibit much better
noise performance than MESFET devices and are used well
into the millimeter-wave frequency range.
