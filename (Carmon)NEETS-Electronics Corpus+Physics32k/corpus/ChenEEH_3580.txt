information are originally continuous in time, which is usually
the case, and they occupy a limited range of frequencies, it is
possible to transform continuous-time signals into discrete-
time signals without losing any signiÔ¨Åcant information. By
interpolation, the discrete-time signal can be mapped back
into the original continuous-time signal.
