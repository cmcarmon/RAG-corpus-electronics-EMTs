FIGURE  30.39 AC  power  supplies  using  HF
switching (PWM or resonant) dc-to-dc converter
as an input stage. HF transformer isolated dc-to-
dc converters can be used to reduce the size and
weight  of  the  power  supply.  Sinusoidal  voltage
output can be obtained using the modulation in
the output inverter stage or in the dc-to-dc con-
verter.
