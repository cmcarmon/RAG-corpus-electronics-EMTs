Antenna
The radar antenna function is to ﬁrst provide spatial directivity to the transmitted EM wave and then to intercept
the scattering of that wave from a target. Most radar antennas may be categorized as mechanically scanning or
electronically  scanning.  Mechanically  scanned  reﬂector  antennas  are  used  in  applications  where  rapid  beam
scanning is not required. Electronic scanning antennas include phased arrays and frequency scanned antennas.

Phased array beams can be steered to any point in their ﬁeld-of-view, typically within 10 to 100 
on the latency of the beam steering subsystem and the switching time of the phase shifters. Phased arrays are
desirable in multiple function radars since they can interleave search operations with multiple target tracks.
