MEDIUM 1 RANGE.The medium 1 range is designed to test for resistance values between 50Ω 
and 10KΩ. Figure 5-31 shows the signatures for a 50Ω resistor, a 1KΩ resistor, and a 10KΩ resistor 
using the medium 1 range. Resistors that are smaller than 50Ω display a signature that is almost a vertical 
line. A 1KΩ resistor causes a change in the angle of rotation of 45º, whereas the display of a 10KΩ 
resistor shows only a slight rotation. Resistance values under test higher than 10KΩ produce a signature 
with such a small rotation angle that it almost appears to be a horizontal line.
