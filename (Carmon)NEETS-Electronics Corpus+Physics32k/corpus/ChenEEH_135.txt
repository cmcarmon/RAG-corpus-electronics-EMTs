Note that the last column in the table shows that the right-
hand side of equation 3.9 approaches zero with each iteration,
indicating that the ﬁnal value is being reached and the iter-
ations can be stopped when the value is sufﬁciently close to
zero. Also note that with each iteration, the change in the
solution is becoming smaller, indicating that one is getting
closer to the exact solution. Since the circuit is nonlinear, the
Jacobian must be computed for each iteration and is usually
the most expensive portion of the entire solution method. If a
better initial guess is made, such as v0 ¼ 1:0
T ,
then the NR method will converge to the ﬁnal value in fewer
iterations.
