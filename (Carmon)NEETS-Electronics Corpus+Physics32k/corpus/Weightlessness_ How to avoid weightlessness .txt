Weightlessness is in contrast with current human experiences in which a non-uniform force is acting, such as:
standing on the ground, sitting in a chair on the ground, etc., where gravity is countered by the support force of the ground,
flying in a plane, where a support force is transmitted from the lift the wings provide (special trajectories which form an exception are described below),
during atmospheric reentry, or during the use of a parachute, when atmospheric drag decelerates a vehicle,
during an orbital maneuver in a spacecraft, or during the launch phase, when rocket engines provide thrust.
In cases where an object is not weightless, as in the above examples, a force acts non-uniformly on the object in question. Aero-dynamic lift, drag, and thrust are all non-uniform forces (they are applied at a point or surface, rather than acting on the entire mass of an object), and thus create the phenomenon of weight. This non-uniform force may also be transmitted to an object at the point of contact with a second object, such as the contact between the surface of the Earth and one's feet, or between a parachute harness and one's body.
