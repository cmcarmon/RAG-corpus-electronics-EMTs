To make fiber geometry measurements, the input end of the fiber is overfilled and any cladding
power stripped out. The output end of the fiber is prepared and viewed with a video camera. Generally the
fiber is less than 10 m in length. An objective lens magnifies the output image (typically 20 Â· ) going to a
video camera. The image from the video camera is displayed on a video monitor and is also sent to the
computer for digital analysis.
