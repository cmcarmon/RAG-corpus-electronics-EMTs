The idea of maintaining a fixed direction in space is simple to illustrate. When any object is spinning 
rapidly, it tends to keep its axis pointed always in the same direction. A toy top is a good example. As 
long as the top is spinning fast, it stays balanced on its point. Because of this gyro action, the spinning top 
resists the tendency of gravity to change the direction of its axis. You can think of many more examples. 
A bicycle is easier to balance at high speed than when it is barely moving. At high speed, the bicycle 
wheels act as gyros, and tend to keep their axes (axles) parallel to the ground.
