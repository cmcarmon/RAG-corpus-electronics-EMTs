Most logic gates are built using diodes and transistors, which I discuss in 
Chapters 9 and 10. Inside each logic gate is a circuit that arranges these 
components in just the right way, so that when you apply input voltages (or 
currents) representing a specific combination of input bits, you get an output 
voltage (or current) that represents the appropriate output bit. The circuitry
