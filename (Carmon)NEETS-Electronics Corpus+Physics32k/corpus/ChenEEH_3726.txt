Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming (DP) has a rich and varied history in
mathematics (Silverman and Morgan, 1990; Bellman, 1957).
DP as we discuss it here is actually a special class of DP
problems that is concerned with discrete sequential decisions.
Let us ﬁrst view DP in a general framework. Consider a
‘‘grid’’ in the plane where discrete points or nodes of interest
are, for convenience, indexed by ordered pairs of non-negative
integers as though they are points in the ﬁrst quadrant of the
Cartesian plane. The basic problem is to ﬁnd a ‘‘shortest
distance’’ or ‘‘least cost’’ path through the grid that begins at
a designated original node, (0,0), and ends at a designated
terminal node, (I, J). A path from node (i0, j0) to node
(iN , jN ) is an ordered set of nodes (index pairs) of the form
(i0, j0), (i1, j1), (i2, j2), (i3, j3), . . . , (iN , jN ), where the inter-
mediate (ik, jk) pairs are not, in general, restricted.
