The best protection against shock from a live circuit is resistance, and resistance can be
added to the body through the use of insulated tools, gloves, boots, and other gear. Current in
a circuit is a function of available voltage divided by the total resistance in the path of the ﬂow.
As we will investigate in greater detail later in this book, resistances have an additive effect
when they’re stacked up so that there’s only one path for electrons to ﬂow:
