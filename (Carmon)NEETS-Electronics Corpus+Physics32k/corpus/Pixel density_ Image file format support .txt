The following table show how pixel density is supported by often used image file formats. In the second column, length refers to horizontal and vertical size in inches, centimeters et cetera, whereas pixel refers only to the number of pixels found along the horizontal and vertical dimension. The cell colors used do not indicate how feature-rich a certain image file format is, but what density support can be expected of a certain image file format. Often-used image file formats that do not support pixel density are added for counter-example purposes.
Even though image manipulation software can optionally set density for some image file formats, not many other software uses density information when displaying images. Web browsers, for example, ignore any density information. Named pixel densities is used mainly for browsers and mobile apps. As the table shows, support for density information in image file formats varies enormously and should be used with great care in a controlled context.
* Support in SVG differs. The standard supports the floats pixelUnitToMillimeterX, pixelUnitToMillimeterY, screenPixelToMillimeterX and screenPixelToMillimeterY for use in CSS2. Inkscape SVG supports density for PNG export only inkscape:export-xdpi and inkscape:export-ydpi. Adobe stores it even differently.
