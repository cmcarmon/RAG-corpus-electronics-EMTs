A GYRO ERECTION SYSTEM must be capable of sensing the difference between the present 
rotor position and the desired rotor position, and must apply forces that will cause the gyro to precess 
toward the desired position. The mercury erection system discussed in this chapter is only one of several 
possible types of gyro erection systems.
