Both types of synchro rotors have their coils wound on laminated cores that are rigidly mounted on a 
shaft. To enable the excitation voltage to be applied to the rotor winding, two slip rings are mounted on 
one end of the shaft and insulated from the shaft to prevent shorting. An insulated terminal board, 
mounted on the end of the cylindrical frame, houses the brushes, which ride on the slip rings. These 
brushes provide continuous electrical contact to the rotor during its rotation. Also mounted on the rotor 
shaft are low-friction ball bearings, which permit the rotor to turn easily.
