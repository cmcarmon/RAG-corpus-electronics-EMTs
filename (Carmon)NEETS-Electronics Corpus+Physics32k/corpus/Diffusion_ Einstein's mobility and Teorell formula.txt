The Einstein relation (kinetic theory) connects the diffusion coefficient and the mobility (the ratio of the particle's terminal drift velocity to an applied force)




D

T
,


{\displaystyle D=\mu \,k_{\text{B}}T,}

where D is the diffusion constant, μ is the "mobility", kB is Boltzmann's constant, T is the absolute temperature.
Below, to combine in the same formula the chemical potential μ and the mobility, we use for mobility the notation





m




{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {m}}}
.
The mobility—based approach was further applied by T. Teorell. In 1935, he studied the diffusion of ions through a membrane. He formulated the essence of his approach in the formula:
the flux is equal to mobility × concentration × force per gram-ion.
This is the so-called Teorell formula. The term "gram-ion" ("gram-particle") is used for a quantity of a substance that contains Avogadro's number of ions (particles). The common modern term is mole.
The force under isothermal conditions consists of two parts:

{\displaystyle -RT{\frac {1}{n}}\,\nabla n=-RT\,\nabla (\ln(n/n^{\text{eq}}))}
.
Electrostatic force caused by electric potential gradient:



q

∇
φ


{\displaystyle q\,\nabla \varphi }
.
Here R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, n is the concentration, the equilibrium concentration is marked by a superscript "eq", q is the charge and φ is the electric potential.
The simple but crucial difference between the Teorell formula and the Onsager laws is the concentration factor in the Teorell expression for the flux. In the Einstein–Teorell approach, If for the finite force the concentration tends to zero then the flux also tends to zero, whereas the Onsager equations violate this simple and physically obvious rule.
The general formulation of the Teorell formula for non-perfect systems under isothermal conditions is

{\displaystyle \mathbf {J} ={\mathfrak {m}}\exp \left({\frac {\mu -\mu _{0}}{RT}}\right)(-\nabla \mu +({\text{external force per mole}})),}

where μ is the chemical potential, μ0 is the standard value of the chemical potential. The expression

{\displaystyle a=\exp \left({\frac {\mu -\mu _{0}}{RT}}\right)}
is the so-called activity. It measures the "effective concentration" of a species in a non-ideal mixture. In this notation, the Teorell formula for the flux has a very simple form
