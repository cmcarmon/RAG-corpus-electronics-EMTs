This Wikipedia series on orders of magnitude does not have a range of shorter distances
To help compare different orders of magnitude this section lists lengths shorter than 10−23 m (10 ym).
1.6 × 10−11 yoctometres (1.6 × 10−35 metres) – the Planck length (Measures of distance shorter than this are considered nonsensical and do not make any physical sense, according to current theories of physics).
1 ym – 1 yoctometre, the smallest named subdivision of the metre in the SI base unit of length, one septillionth of a metre.
1 ym – length of a neutrino.
