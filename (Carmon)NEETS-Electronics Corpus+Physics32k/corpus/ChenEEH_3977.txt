vectors of a and b are ~dda3 ¼ (0, 1, 0)t and ~ddb3 ¼ (1, 0, 0)t ,
respectively. On the other hand, the true dependence vector
of c is (0, 0:1)t . If all dependence vectors are plotted in the
index space J 3, a 3-D DG is yielded in Figure 7.2(A). Each
node represents a data ﬂow graph (DFG) of multiplication and
addition as shown in Figure 7.2(B), respectively.
