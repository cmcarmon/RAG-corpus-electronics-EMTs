Basic Magnetic Disk System Architecture
We will review here the basic terminology of magnetic disk devices and controllers and then examine the disk
subsystems  of  three  manufacturers  (IBM,  Cray,  and  DEC).  Throughout  this  section  we  are  concerned  with
technologies that support random access, rather than sequential access (e.g., magnetic tape). A more detailed
discussion,  focusing  on  the  structure  of  small  dimension  disk  drives,  can  be  found  in Vasudeva  [1988].  The
spindle consists of a collection of platters. Platters are metal disks
basic concepts are illustrated in Fig. 80.11. A
