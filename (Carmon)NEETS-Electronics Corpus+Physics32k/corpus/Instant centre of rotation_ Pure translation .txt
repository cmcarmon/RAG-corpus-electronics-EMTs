If the displacement between two positions is a pure translation, then the perpendicular bisectors of the segments A1B1 and A2B2 form parallel lines. These lines are considered to intersect at a point on the line at infinity, thus the pole of this planar displacement is said to "lie at infinity" in the direction of the perpendicular bisectors.
In the limit, pure translation becomes planar movement with point velocity vectors that are parallel. In this case, the instant centre is said to lie at infinity in the direction perpendicular to the velocity vectors.
