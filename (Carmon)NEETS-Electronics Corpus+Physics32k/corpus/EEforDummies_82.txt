If you take a copper wire and arrange it in a closed loop by twisting the ends 
together, do you think the free electrons will flow? Well, the electrons might 
dance around a bit, because they’re so easy to move. But unless a force 
pushes the electrons one way or another, you won’t get current to flow.
