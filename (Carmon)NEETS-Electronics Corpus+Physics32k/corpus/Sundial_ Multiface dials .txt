A common type of multiple dial has sundials on every face of a Platonic solid (regular polyhedron), usually a cube.
Extremely ornate sundials can be composed in this way, by applying a sundial to every surface of a solid object.
In some cases, the sundials are formed as hollows in a solid object, e.g., a cylindrical hollow aligned with the Earth's rotational axis (in which the edges play the role of styles) or a spherical hollow in the ancient tradition of the hemisphaerium or the antiboreum. (See the History section above.) In some cases, these multiface dials are small enough to sit on a desk, whereas in others, they are large stone monuments.
A Polyhedral's dial faces can be designed to give the time for different time-zones simultaneously.
