On 29 January 1900, a government ordinance limited the speed of vehicles inside settlements to the velocity of a hand-cantering horse. In 1935, the speed limit inside settlements was set at 35 km/h (22 mph). Vehicles with two or more trailers were limited to 35 km/h, while trucks and buses were limited to 50 km/h (31 mph). However, public buses could ask for an exception.
A law in 1950 limited the speed in thick fog to 25 km/h (16 mph) and at level crossings to 15 km/h (9.3 mph). An ordinance introduced in 1953 specified places where speed needs to be slow, i.e. under 15 km/h: along processions, at pedestrian crossings, while the driver is entering the road, near buses or trams, near work places, while the road is oily or while pedestrian traffic is dense.
A law in 1960 limited the speed inside settlements between 5 a.m. and 11 p.m. to 50 km/h (31 mph). Buses and trucks over 3,500 kg (7,700 lb) were limited outside settlements to 80 km/h (50 mph). Also, in 1966, motorcycles were limited to 80 km/h. Long-distance buses were freed from limits. Towed automobiles were limited to 50 km/h.
Speed limits were abolished on motorways (d√°lnice), even for trucks and motorcycles, in 1971. Furthermore, in 1976, all of the 50 km/h limits were increased to 60 km/h (37 mph). The special limits for motorcycles, trucks and buses were repealed. The ordinance in 1979 was the first to limit speeds outside of settlements. Cars were limited to 90 km/h (56 mph) and 110 km/h (68 mph) on motorways, long-distance buses to 90 km/h, motorcycles and trucks under 6,000 kg (13,000 lb) to 80 km/h (50 mph), trucks over 6000 kg and buses to 70 km/h (43 mph). The limit of 60 km/h (only between 5 a.m. and 11 p.m.) was kept for roads inside settlements.
A limit of 90 km/h (56 mph) and 110 km/h (68 mph) on motorways was established in 1989 for vehicles under 3500 kg and for buses. Furthermore, motorcycles were limited to 90 km/h and all other motor vehicles were limited to 80 km/h (50 mph). The speed inside settlements was limited 60 km/h (37 mph) and 80 km/h on motorways, including at night. Specially signed pedestrian zones and house zones was introduced with a 20 km/h (12 mph) limit.
Ordinance No. 223/1997 Sb., which took effect on October 1, 1997, reduced the settlement limit to 50 km/h (31 mph) and increased the motorway limit to 130 km/h (81 mph), including for motorcycles.
