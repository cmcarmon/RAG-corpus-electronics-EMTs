• Governor. This is to control the mechanical power input Pin. The control is via a feedback loop where
the speed of the rotor is constantly monitored. For instance, if this speed falls behind the synchronous
speed, the input is insufﬁcient and has to be increased. This is done by opening up the valve to increase
the steam for turbogenerators or the ﬂow of water through the penstock for hydrogenerators. Governors
are mechanical systems and therefore have some signiﬁcant time lags (many seconds) compared to other
electromagnetic phenomena associated with the machine. If the time duration of interest is short, the
effect of governor can be ignored in the study; that is, Pin is treated as a constant.
