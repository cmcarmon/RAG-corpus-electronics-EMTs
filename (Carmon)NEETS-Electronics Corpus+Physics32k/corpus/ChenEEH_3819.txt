Histogram Equalization
By looking at Figure 4.11(A), one notices that the image is too
dark. This can be conﬁrmed by the image’s histogram in Figure
4.11(B), where one can see that the most frequent gray levels
have low values. To enhance the appearance of the image, one
would need to re-map the image’s gray levels so that they
become more uniformly distributed. Ideally, one would need
to apply a transformation that would make the histogram of
the image look uniform. If FU (u) ¼
u
0 pU (x)dx is the distri-
bution function of the image, then this transformation would
