forward  characteristics  with  low  forward  voltage 
drop. Rectifier diodes need to be able to cope with 
high  values of reverse voltage and large  values of 
forward current, consistency of characteristics is of 
secondary  importance  in  such  applications.  Table 
5.1  summarizes 
the  characteristics  of  some 
common semiconductor diodes whilst a selection of 
diodes are shown in Fig. 5.9.
