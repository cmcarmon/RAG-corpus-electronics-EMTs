The IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems also publishes circuit design articles. Unlike the IEEE Journal
of Solid-State Circuits, this journal addresses passive and active, discrete component circuits, as well as integrated
circuits and systems, and it features theoretic research that underpins circuit design strategies.
