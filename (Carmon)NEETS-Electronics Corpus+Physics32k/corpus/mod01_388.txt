Figure 2-9 shows the makeup of a lead-acid battery. The container houses the separate cells. Most 
containers are hard rubber, plastic, or some other material that is resistant to the electrolyte and 
mechanical shock and will withstand extreme temperatures. The container (battery case) is vented through 
vent plugs to allow the gases that form within the cells to escape. The plates in the battery are the 
cathodes and anodes that were discussed earlier. In figure 2-10 the negative plate group is the cathode of 
the individual cells and the positive plate group is the anode. As shown in the figure, the plates are 
interlaced with a terminal attached to each plate group. The terminals of the individual cells are connected 
together by link connectors as shown in figure 2-9. The cells are connected in series in the battery and the
