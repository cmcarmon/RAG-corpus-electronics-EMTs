If the signal in question is a constant whose value we seek, as is the case sometimes in simple
measurement systems, the measurement accuracy will be enhanced by a low-pass ﬁlter with the
smallest bandwidth B. Low-pass ﬁltering, in a sense, carries out the operation of averaging, since
a constant corresponds to the average value (or dc component) and since noise usually has zero
average value. However, some noise will get through the ﬁlter and cause the processed signal
z(t) to ﬂuctuate about the true value x, as shown in Figure 14.3.11. Allowing any sample to fall
somewhere between x − ε and x + ε, the rms error G is deﬁned by
