Semiconductor diodes 
 
When a junction is formed between N-type and Pâ€“ 
type  semiconductor  materials,  the  resulting  device 
is  called  a  diode.  This  component  offers  an 
extremely  low  resistance  to  current  flow  in  one 
direction  and  an  extremely  high  resistance  to 
current flow in the other. This characteristic allows 
the  diode  to  be  used  in  applications  that  require  a 
circuit  to  behave  differently  according  to  the 
direction of current flowing in it. 
  An ideal diode would pass an infinite current in 
one  direction  and  no  current  at  all  in  the  other 
direction.  In  addition,  the  diode  would  start  to 
conduct current when the smallest of voltages was 
present. In practice, a small voltage must be applied 
before conduction takes place. Furthermore a small 
leakage current will flow in the reverse direction.
This leakage current is usually a very small fraction 
of the current that flows in the forward direction.
