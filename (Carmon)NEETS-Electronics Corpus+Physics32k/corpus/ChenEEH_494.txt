transistors have a much lower performance than their npn
counterparts. Lateral pnp transistors usually are quite slow
(fT around 0.2 to 1 GHz) and consume signiÔ¨Åcant space on a
chip. Vertical pnp transistors can be about a factor of 10 faster
than LPNPs but suffer often from a large collector series resist-
ance and associated high-current effects already at quite low
collector current densities.
