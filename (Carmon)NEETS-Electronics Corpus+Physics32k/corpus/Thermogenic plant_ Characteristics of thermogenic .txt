Most thermogenic plants tend to be rather large. This is because the smaller plants do not have enough space to create a considerable amount of heat. Large plants, on the other hand, have a lot of mass to create and retain heat.
Thermogenic plants are also protogynous. This means that the female part of the plant matures before the male part of the same plant. This reduces inbreeding considerably. The only way the plant could get fertilized is from receiving pollen from different plants. This is why thermogenic plants release pungent odors to attract flies.
