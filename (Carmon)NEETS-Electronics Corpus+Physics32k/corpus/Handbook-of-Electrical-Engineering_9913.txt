Root Loci of Digital Control Systems
The root locus analysis presented in the preceding subsections can be applied to digital control systems without
modifying  the  basic  principles.  For  a  linear  time-invariant  digital  control  system,  the  transfer  functions  are
expressed  in  terms  of  the  z-transform  rather  than  the  Laplace  transform.  The  relationship  between  the  z-
transform variable z and the Laplace transform variable s is
