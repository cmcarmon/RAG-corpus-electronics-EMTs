For an electron to become detectable, a photon must first interact with it, and this interaction will inevitably change the path of that electron. It is also possible for other, less direct means of measurement to affect the electron. It is necessary to distinguish clearly between the measured value of a quantity and the value resulting from the measurement process. In particular, a measurement of momentum is non-repeatable in short intervals of time. A formula (one-dimensional for simplicity) relating involved quantities, due to Niels Bohr (1928) is given by

{\displaystyle |v'_{x}-v_{x}|\Delta p_{x}\approx \hbar /\Delta t,}

where
Δpx is uncertainty in measured value of momentum,
Δt is duration of measurement,
vx is velocity of particle before measurement,
v 'x  is velocity of particle after measurement,
ħ is the reduced Planck constant.
The measured momentum of the electron is then related to vx, whereas its momentum after the measurement is related to v′x. This is a best-case scenario.
