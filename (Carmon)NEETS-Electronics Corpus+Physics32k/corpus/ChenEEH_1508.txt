Process management in UNIX uses two key data structures,
the process table and the user structure. The former is always
in memory, but the latter can be swapped or paged out.
Process creation is done by duplicating the process table
entry and then the memory image. Scheduling is done using
a priority-based algorithm that favors interactive users.
