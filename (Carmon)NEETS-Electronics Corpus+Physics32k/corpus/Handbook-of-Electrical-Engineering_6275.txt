When the power output of a TV transmitter is discussed, the visual section is the primary consideration.
Output power refers to the peak power of the visual section of the transmitter (peak of sync). The FCC-licensed
ERP is equal to the transmitter power output minus feedline losses times the power gain of the antenna.
