Three basic reference planes are used to describe location.
The sagittal plane is a plane parallel to the sagittal suture. All other sagittal planes (referred to as parasagittal planes) are parallel to it. It is also known as a "longitudinal plane". The plane is a Y-Z plane, perpendicular to the ground.
The median plane or midsagittal plane is in the midline of the body, and divides the body into left and right (sinister and dexter) portions.  This passes through the head, spinal cord, navel and, in animals, the tail.  The median plane can also refer to the midsagittal plane of other structures, such as a digit.
The frontal plane or coronal plane divides the body into dorsal and ventral (back and front, or posterior and anterior) portions. For post-embryonic humans a coronal plane is vertical and a transverse plane is horizontal, but for embryos and quadrupeds a coronal plane is horizontal and a transverse plane is vertical. A longitudinal plane is any plane perpendicular to the transverse plane. The coronal plane and the sagittal plane are examples of longitudinal planes.
A transverse plane, also known as a cross-section, divides the body into cranial and caudal (head and tail) portions.
In human anatomy
A transverse (also known as horizontal) plane is an X-Z plane, parallel to the ground, which (in humans) separates the superior from the inferior or, put another way, the head from the feet.
A coronal (also known as frontal) plane is a X-Y plane, perpendicular to the ground, which (in humans) separates the anterior from the posterior, the front from the back, the ventral from the dorsal.
