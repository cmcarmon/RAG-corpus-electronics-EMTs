In a fiber, the propagation constant of a plane wave is a function of the wave's wavelength and mode.
The change in the propagation constant for different waves is called dispersion. The change in the
propagation constant for different wavelengths is called chromatic dispersion. The change in propagation
constant for different modes is called modal dispersion. These dispersions cause the light pulse to spread
as it goes down the fiber (fig. 2-16). Some dispersion occurs in all types of fibers. Dispersion is discussed
later in this chapter.
