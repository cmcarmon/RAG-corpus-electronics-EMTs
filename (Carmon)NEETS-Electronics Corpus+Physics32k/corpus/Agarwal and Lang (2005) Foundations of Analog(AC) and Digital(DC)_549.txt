Thus if R5 is replaced by a voltmeter, the circuit can be used to find an unknown
resistor, say R3, in terms of three known resistors. Make one of the resistors, say R1,
a decade box with known resistance values and adjust until the voltmeter reads zero.
The value of R3 is then given by Equation 3.131.
