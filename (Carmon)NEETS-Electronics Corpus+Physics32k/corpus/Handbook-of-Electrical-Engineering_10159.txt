Resolved Motion Control
So far we have discussed the methods to achieve desired joint motion. In practice, the desired motion is speciÔ¨Åed
in terms of hand motions. Resolved motion control methods such as resolved motion rate control (RMRC) and
resolved motion acceleration control have been suggested [papers by Whitney and Luh et al. in Brady et al., 1982].
In  these  methods,  the  joint  motions  are  coordinated  to  achieve  coordinated  hand  motion  along  any  world
coordinate axis. Given the relationship between the position and orientation of the hand, x(t), and the joint
coordinates q(t) as
