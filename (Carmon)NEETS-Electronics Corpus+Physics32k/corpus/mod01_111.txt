The field about a charged body is generally represented by lines which are referred to as
ELECTROSTATIC LINES OF FORCE. These lines are imaginary and are used merely to represent the
direction and strength of the field. To avoid confusion, the lines of force exerted by a positive charge are
always shown leaving the charge, and for a negative charge they are shown entering. Figure 1-7 illustrates
the use of lines to represent the field about charged bodies.
