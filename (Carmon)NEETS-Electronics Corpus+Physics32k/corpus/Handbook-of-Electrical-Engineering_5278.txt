Advantages of PV include demonstrated low operation and maintenance costs, no moving parts, silent and
simple  operation,  almost  unlimited  lifetime  if  properly  cared  for,  no  recurring  fuel  costs,  modularity,  and
minimal environmental effects. The disadvantages are its cost, need for large collector areas due to the diluteness
of insolation, and the diurnal and seasonal variability of the output.
