The second method, which may be used when controlled sources are present in the network, requires the
computation of both the Th√©venin equivalent voltage (the open-circuit voltage at the terminals of the network)
and  the  Norton  equivalent  current  (the  current  through  the  short-circuited  terminals  of  the  network).  The
equivalent impedance is the ratio of these two quantities
