The normal speed range is from 110 to 25,000 rpm. At speeds below 600 rpm, "flicker" becomes a
problem because the human eye cannot retain successive images long enough to create the illusion of
continuous motion. The life of the strobotron lamp is approximately 250 hours if used at flashing speeds
of less than 5,000 rpm, or 100 hours if used at higher speeds.
