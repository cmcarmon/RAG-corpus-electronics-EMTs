In view A of figure 3-7, the circuit to be tested has an applied voltage of 100 millivolts and a
resistance of 100 ohms. The current normally flowing in this circuit is 1 milliampere. In view B, an
ammeter that requires 1 milliampere for full-scale deflection and that has an internal resistance of 100
ohms has been inserted. Since 1 milliampere of current flow is shown in view A, you might naturally
assume that with the meter inserted into the circuit, a full-scale deflection will occur. You might also
assume that the 1 milliampere of circuit current will be measured. However, neither of these assumptions
is correct. With the ammeter inserted into the circuit, as shown in view B, the total resistance of the circuit
is 200 ohms. With an applied voltage of 100 millivolts, applying Ohmâ€™s law shows the actual current
(Icircuit) to be 0.5 milliampere.
