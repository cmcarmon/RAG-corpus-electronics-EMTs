It is noteworthy that in recent years, popularity of the client/server architecture has increased. This archi-
tecture is practically a derivative of shared-nothing case. In this model, clientsâ€™ nodes access data through one
or more servers. This approach derives its strength from an attractive price/performance ratio, a high level of
scalability, and the ease with which additional remote hosts can be integrated into the system. Another driving
force of the client/server approach is the current trend toward corporate downsizing.
