When the modulating signal is applied to the base of Q2, the emitter-to-base bias varies at the
modulation rate. This causes the collector voltage of Q2 to vary at the same modulating rate. When the
collector voltage increases, output capacitance CCE decreases; when the collector voltage decreases, CCE
increases. An increase in collector voltage has the effect of spreading the plates of CCE farther apart by
increasing the width of the barrier. A decrease of collector voltage reduces the width of the pn junction
and has the same effect as pushing the capacitor plates together to provide more capacitance.
