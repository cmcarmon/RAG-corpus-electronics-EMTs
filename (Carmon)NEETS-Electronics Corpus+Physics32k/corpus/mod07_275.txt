View B of figure 3-2 is an energy diagram of a reverse-biased Zener diode. The energy bands of the 
P and N materials are naturally at different levels, but reverse bias causes the valence band of the P 
material to overlap the energy level of the conduction band in the N material. Under this condition, the 
valence electrons of the P material can cross the extremely thin junction region at the overlap point 
without acquiring any additional energy. This action is called tunneling. When the breakdown point of the 
PN junction is reached, large numbers of minority carriers "tunnel" across the junction to form the current 
that occurs at breakdown. The tunneling phenomenon only takes place in heavily doped diodes such as 
Zener diodes.
