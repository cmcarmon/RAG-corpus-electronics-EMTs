For both massive and massless particles in a box, the states of a particle are enumerated by a set of quantum numbers [nx, ny, nz]. The magnitude of the momentum is given by

{\displaystyle p={\frac {h}{2L}}{\sqrt {n_{x}^{2}+n_{y}^{2}+n_{z}^{2}}}\qquad \qquad n_{x},n_{y},n_{z}=1,2,3,\ldots }

where h is Planck's constant and L is the length of a side of the box. Each possible state of a particle can be thought of as a point on a 3-dimensional grid of positive integers. The distance from the origin to any point will be

Suppose each set of quantum numbers specify f states where f is the number of internal degrees of freedom of the particle that can be altered by collision. For example, a spin 1/2 particle would have f=2, one for each spin state. For large values of n, the number of states with magnitude of momentum less than or equal to p from the above equation is approximately

{\displaystyle g=\left({\frac {f}{8}}\right){\frac {4}{3}}\pi n^{3}={\frac {4\pi f}{3}}\left({\frac {Lp}{h}}\right)^{3}}

which is just f times the volume of a sphere of radius n divided by eight since only the octant with positive ni is considered. Using a continuum approximation, the number of states with magnitude of momentum between p and p+dp is therefore

where V=L3 is the volume of the box. Notice that in using this continuum approximation, the ability to characterize the low-energy states is lost, including the ground state where ni=1. For most cases this will not be a problem, but when considering Bose–Einstein condensation, in which a large portion of the gas is in or near the ground state, the ability to deal with low energy states becomes important.
Without using the continuum approximation, the number of particles with energy εi is given by
