The logic elements can be anything from relays with their slow on and off switching action to modern off-
the-shelf integrated circuit (IC) transistor switches with their extremely fast switching action. Modern ICs exist
in  various  technologies  and  circuit  conÔ¨Ågurations  such  as  transistor-transistor  logic  (TTL),  complementary
metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS), emitter-coupled logic (ECL), and integrated injection logic (I2L), just to
name a few.
