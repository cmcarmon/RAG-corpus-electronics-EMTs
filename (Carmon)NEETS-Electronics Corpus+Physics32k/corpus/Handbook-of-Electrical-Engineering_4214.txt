Perturbations  in  the  illumination  due  to  the  mechanical  and  electrical  sources  distort  the  illumination
function  and  constrain  performance  in  these  areas.  Mechanical  illumination  error  sources  include  antenna
shape deformation due to sag and thermal effects as well as manufacturing defects. Electrical illumination error
is of particular concern in phased arrays where sources include beam steering computational error and phase
shifter quantization. Control of both the mechanical and electrical perturbation errors is the key to both low
sidelobes and highly accurate angle measurements. Control denotes that either tolerances are closely held and
maintained or that there must be some means for monitoring and correction. Phased arrays are attractive for
low sidelobe applications since they can provide element-level phase and amplitude control.
