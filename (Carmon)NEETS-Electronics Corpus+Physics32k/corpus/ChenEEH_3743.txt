Such problems arise when the test or reference sequence, or
both, are modeled by stochastic process(es) so that the search
costs are random variables whose values depend on the out-
come(s) of the stochastic process(es) to be matched. Given
random test and reference sequences, the search costs can only
be modeled as random variables. Once realizations of the test
and reference sequences are available, however, the search can
proceed as in the deterministic case with costs determined
‘‘online.’’ Such a modiﬁed search procedure, called the Viterbi
algorithm (Viterbi, 1967), plays a key role in the training and
decoding of the HMM, to which we now turn.
