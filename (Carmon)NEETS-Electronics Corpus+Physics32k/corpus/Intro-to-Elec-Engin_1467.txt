image response is suppressed by using the antenna and other RF-tuned circuits as a ﬁlter. By
limiting the bandwidth of the RF ampliﬁer to the range Bc < BRF < 2fIF, where Bc is the
bandwidth of the AM radio signal (10 kHz), the radio signal transmitted at the image frequency
= fLO + fIF) is rejected. A similar behavior occurs when f LO is lower than fc. Figure 15.2.21

illustrates the AM station and image frequencies for a high-side and a low-side local oscillator,
whereas Figure 15.2.22 depicts the frequency response characteristics of IF and RF ampliﬁers for
the case fLO > fc.
