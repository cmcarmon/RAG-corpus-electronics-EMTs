These expressions generalize the results (3.3) we obtained for resistor circuits. We have derived a fundamental
result: Only the real part of impedance contributes to long-term power dissipation. Of the circuit
elements, only the resistor dissipates power. Capacitors and inductors dissipate no power in the long term.
It is important to realize that these statements apply only for sinusoidal sources. If you turn on a constant
voltage source in an RC-circuit, charging the capacitor does consume power.
