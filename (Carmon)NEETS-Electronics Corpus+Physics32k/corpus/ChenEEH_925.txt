yields a consistent linear system with the same number of
variables as equations where the matrix T
is the matrix
Tnbr with the rightmost column deleted. The most efÔ¨Åcient
way to solve the system characterized by equation 4.40 with
the highest accuracy is by back substitution (only addition/
subtraction operations are necessary). In the software imple-
mentation of this algorithm discussed in this work, tcd is
