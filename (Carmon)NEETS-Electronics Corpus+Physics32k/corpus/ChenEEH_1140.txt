The operation can be understood with reference to the sche-
matic shown in Figure 6.13. Each picture element of the DMD
has three operational levels. The lowest is electronic. It con-
tains the CMOS electronics that control the operation of the
device by applying voltages that produce electrostatic forces on
the movable elements. The second layer is mechanical. It has
the torsional hinges that allow the mirror to be tipped 10
degrees one way or the other. The top layer is optical, consist-
ing of the aluminized mirrors that reﬂect the light falling on it
either into a beam dump or else through a projection system
onto the screen. The light originates in a xenon arc lamp and
then passes through a rotating red–green–blue ﬁlter that cycles
at 60 Hz. During each color phase of each cycle, the mirrors tilt
to pass light to the screen for no time, some time, or all of the
time. This serves to adjust the relative brightness of each color
during each cycle.
