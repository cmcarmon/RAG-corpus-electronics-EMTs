One way to understand an equation more fully is to understand what it is normalized to, which gives you an idea of the scales of interest. The time, position, and electric potential are normalized to t',x', and




ϕ
′



{\displaystyle \phi '}

The time scale for the Hasegawa–Mima equation is the inverse ion gyrofrequency:

{\displaystyle t'=\omega _{ci}t,\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \omega _{ci}={\frac {eZB}{m_{i}c}}.}

From the large magnetic field assumption the normalized time is very small. However, it is still large enough to get information out of it.
The distance scale is the gyroradius based on the sound speed:

{\displaystyle x'={\frac {x}{\rho _{s}}},\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \rho _{s}^{2}\equiv {\frac {T_{e}}{m_{i}\omega _{ci}^{2}}}.}

If you transform to k-space, it is clear that when k, the wavenumber, is much larger than one, the terms that make the Hasegawa–Mima equation differ from the equation derived from Navier-Stokes equation in a two dimensional incompressible flow become much smaller than the rest.
From the distance and time scales we can determine the scale for velocities. This turns out to be the sound speed. The Hasegawa–Mima equation, shows us the dynamics of fast moving sounds as opposed to the slower dynamics such as flows that are captured in the MHD equations. The motion is even faster than the sound speed given that the time scales are much smaller than the time normalization.
The potential is normalized to:





ϕ

{\displaystyle \phi '={\frac {e\phi }{T_{e}}}.}

Since the electrons fit a Maxwellian and the quasineutrality condition holds, this normalized potential is small, but similar order to the normalized time derivative.

{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{\omega _{ci}}}{\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}\left(\rho _{s}^{2}\nabla ^{2}{\frac {e\phi }{T_{e}}}-{\frac {e\phi }{T_{e}}}\right)-\left[\left(\rho _{s}\nabla {\frac {e\phi }{T_{e}}}\times \mathbf {\hat {z}} \right)\cdot \rho _{s}\nabla \right]\left[\rho _{s}^{2}\nabla ^{2}{\frac {e\phi }{T_{e}}}-\ln \left({\frac {n_{0}}{\omega _{ci}}}\right)\right]=0.}

Although the time derivative divided by the cyclotron frequency is much smaller than unity, and the normalized electric potential is much smaller than unity, as long as the gradient is on the order of one, both terms are comparable to the nonlinear term. The unperturbed density gradient can also be just as small as the normalized electric potential and be comparable to the other terms.
