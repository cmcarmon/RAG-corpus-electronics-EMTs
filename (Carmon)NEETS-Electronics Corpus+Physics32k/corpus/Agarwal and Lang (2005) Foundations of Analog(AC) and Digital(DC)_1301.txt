It is also interesting to note that the circuits shown in Figures 9.31 through
9.34 perform either integration or differentiation of the source current or voltage
as it produces the branch voltages or currents, respectively. Thus, if viewed in
this way each circuit is an integrator or differentiator. We will make use of this
capability of capacitors and inductors in future chapters as we build filters and
other signal processing circuits.
