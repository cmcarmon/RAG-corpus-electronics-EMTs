Another demonstrated application of integrated optics in the telecommunications area is in coherent com-
munication systems. These systems require both phase modulators and polarization controllers. Current optical
Ô¨Åber transmission systems rely on intensity modulated data transmission schemes. Coherent communication
systems are attractive because of the promise of higher bit rates, wavelength division multiplexing capability,
and greater noise immunity. In coherent communication systems the information is coded by varying either
the phase or frequency of the optical carrier with a phase modulator. At the receiver, a polarization controller
is used to ensure a good signal-to-noise ratio in the heterodyne detection system.
