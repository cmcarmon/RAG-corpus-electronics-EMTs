If the output voltage tries to increase, the sample volt-
age also increases. This increases the bias voltage on the 
base of transistor Q2. The emitter voltage of transistor Q2 
is held constant by zener diode D1. This results in tran-
sistor Q2 conducting more and increasing the current 
through resistor R2. In turn, the voltage on the collector 
of transistor Q2 and the base of transistor Q1 decreases. 
This decreases the forward bias of transistor Q1, causing 
it to conduct less. When transistor Q1 conducts less, less 
current flows. This causes a smaller voltage drop across 
the load and cancels the increase in voltage.
