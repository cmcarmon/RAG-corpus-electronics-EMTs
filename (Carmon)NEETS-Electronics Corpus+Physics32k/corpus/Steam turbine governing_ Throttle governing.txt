Low initial cost and simple mechanism makes throttle governing the most apt method for small steam turbines. The mechanism is illustrated in figure 1. The valve is actuated by using a centrifugal governor which consists of flying balls attached to the arm of the sleeve. A geared mechanism connects the turbine shaft to the rotating shaft on which the sleeve reciprocates axially. With a reduction in the load the turbine shaft speed increases and brings about the movement of the flying balls away from the sleeve axis. This results in an axial movement of the sleeve followed by the activation of a lever, which in turn actuates the main stop valve to a partially opened position to control the flow rate.
