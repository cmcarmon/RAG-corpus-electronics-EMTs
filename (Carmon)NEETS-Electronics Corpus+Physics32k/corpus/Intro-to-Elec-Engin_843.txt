where E is the energy in joules that is transferred during the interval, and P is the average value
of the real-power component in joules per second. Note that the reactive-power component does
not contribute to the energy that is dissipated in the load. The energy associated with the reactive
power component is transferred between the electric ﬁelds (which result from the application of
the sinusoidal voltage between the phase conductors and ground) and the magnetic ﬁelds (which
result from the ﬂow of sinusoidal current through the phase conductors).
