To summarize, we use transmission lines for high-frequency wireline signal communication.
In wireline
communication, we have a direct, physical connection—a circuit—between transmitter and receiver. When
we select the transmission line characteristics and the transmission frequency so that we operate in the high-
frequency regime, signals are not ﬁltered as they propagate along the transmission line: The characteristic
impedance is real-valued—the transmission line’s equivalent impedance is a resistor—and all the signal’s
