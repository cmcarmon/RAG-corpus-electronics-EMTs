You have seen how a series peaking coil isolates the output capacitance of an amplifier from the
input capacitance of the next stage. You have also seen how a shunt peaking coil will counteract the
effects of the total capacitance of an amplifier. If these two techniques are used together, the combination
is more effective than the use of either one alone. The use of both series and shunt peaking coils is known
as COMBINATION PEAKING. An amplifier circuit with combination peaking is shown in figure 2-8. In
figure 2-8 the peaking coils are L1 and L2. L1 is a shunt peaking coil, and L2 is a series peaking coil.
