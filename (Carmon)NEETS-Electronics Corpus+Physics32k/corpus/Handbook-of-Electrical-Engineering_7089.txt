Video compression methods exploit the correlation in both space and time of the sequence of images to improve
compression.  There  is  a  very  high  correlation  between  successive  frames  of  a  video  signal,  and  this  can  be
exploited along with methods similar to those used for coding images to achieve compression ratios up to 200:1
for high-quality lossy compression. Standards for full-motion video and audio compression are being developed
by the Moving Pictures Experts Group (MPEG). Applications of video compression techniques include video-
conferencing, multimedia CD-ROMs, and high-deÔ¨Ånition TV.
