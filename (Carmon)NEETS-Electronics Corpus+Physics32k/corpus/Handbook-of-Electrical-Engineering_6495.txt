Various levels of compression complexity can be used, depending on the ultimate bit rate and quality required.
Each degree of complexity removes different types of redundancy from the video image. The image is broken

  8.  By  comparing  different  blocks  and  transmitting  only  the  differences
into  blocks  of  pixels,  typically  8 
(DPCM), factors of 2 reduction in bit rate can be obtained. No degradation of quality need result. Much of
the information within each block is imperceptible to the viewer. Vector quantization (VQ) or discrete-cosine
transform (DCT) techniques can be used to eliminate bits corresponding to these imperceptible details. This
intraframe coding can result in a factor of 20 reduction in the bit rate, although the evaluation of image quality
becomes subjective. Finally, stationary images or moving objects need not require constant retransmission of
every detail. Motion compression techniques have been developed to eliminate these interframe redundancies.
Combinations  of  these  techniques  have  resulted  in  coders  that  convert  NTSC-like  video  (100 Mbps  uncom-
pressed) into a few megabits per second and HDTV images (1 Gbps uncompressed) into less than 20 Mbps.
