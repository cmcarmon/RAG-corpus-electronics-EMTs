In a collision with a coefficient of restitution e, the change in kinetic energy can be written as

where vrel is the relative velocity of the bodies before collision.
For typical applications in nuclear physics, where one particle's mass is much larger than the other the reduced mass can be approximated as the smaller mass of the system. The limit of the reduced mass formula as one mass goes to infinity is the smaller mass, thus this approximation is used to ease calculations, especially when the larger particle's exact mass is not known.
