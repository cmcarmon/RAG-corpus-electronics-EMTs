Once a system design has been formulated, each link is analyzed to determine its viability. Link
analysis involves calculating each link's power budget and risetime budget. Calculating a power budget
involves identifying all of the sources of loss in the fiber optic link. These losses and an additional safety
margin are then compared to the difference between the transmitter output power and the receiver
sensitivity. The difference between the transmitter output power and the receiver sensitivity is referred to
as the available power. If the sources of loss plus the safety margin are less than the available power in
the link, the design is viable.
