The barometric formula depends only on the height of the fluid chamber, and not on its width or length. Given a large enough height, any pressure may be attained. This feature of hydrostatics has been called the hydrostatic paradox. As expressed by W. H. Besant,
Any quantity of liquid, however small, may be made to support any weight, however large.
The Dutch scientist Simon Stevin was the first to explain the paradox mathematically. In 1916 Richard Glazebrook mentioned the hydrostatic paradox as he described an arrangement he attributed to Pascal: a heavy weight W rests on a board with area A resting on a fluid bladder connected to a vertical tube with cross-sectional area α. Pouring water of weight w down the tube will eventually raise the heavy weight. Balance of forces leads to the equation

.


{\displaystyle W={\frac {wA}{\alpha }}.}

Glazebrook says, "By making the area of the board considerable and that of the tube small, a large weight W can be supported by a small weight w of water. This fact is sometimes described as the hydrostatic paradox."
Demonstrations of the hydrostatic paradox are used in teaching the phenomenon.
