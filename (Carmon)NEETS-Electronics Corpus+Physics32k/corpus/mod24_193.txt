There are two different types of dispersion in optical fibers. The types are intramodal and intermodal
dispersion. Intramodal, or chromatic, dispersion occurs in all types of fibers. Intermodal, or modal,
dispersion occurs only in multimode fibers. Each type of dispersion mechanism leads to pulse spreading.
As a pulse spreads, energy is overlapped. This condition is shown in figure 2-24. The spreading of the
optical pulse as it travels along the fiber limits the information capacity of the fiber.
