Another type of rate gyro (often used in inertial navigation equipment) is the floated gyro unit. This 
unit generally uses a restraint known as a torsion bar. The advantage of the torsion bar over the spring is 
that the torsion bar needs no lever arm to exert torque. The torsion bar is mounted along the output axis 
(fig. 3-17), and produces restraining torque in either direction by twisting instead of pulling. Also, there is 
no gimbal bearing friction to cause interference with gyro operation.
