Be careful with your units of measurement when you add  resistance values. 
For example, suppose you connect the following resistors in series: 1.2 k立, 
680 立, and 470 立. (Refer to Figure 5足13.) Before you add the resistances, you 
need to convert the values to the same units, for instance, ohms. In this case, 
the total resistance, Rseries, is calculated as follows:
