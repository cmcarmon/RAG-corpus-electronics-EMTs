Examples of message switching protocols that have been used to build message switching systems are Simple
Mail  Transfer  Protocol  (SMTP)  and  the  International  Telegraph  and  Telephone  Consultative  Committee
(CCITT)  X.400  series.  The  former  is  much  more  widely  deployed,  while  the  latter  has  signiÔ¨Åcantly  broader
capabilities,  but  its  deployment  is  plagued  by  having  two  incompatible  versions  (1984  and  1988)  and  other
problems. Many commercial vendors offer message switching services based on either one of the above protocols
or a proprietary protocol.
