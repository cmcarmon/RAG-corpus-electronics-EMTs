Achieving acceptable levels of software quality has been one of the most troublesome areas of software engi-
neering  since  the  industry  began.  It  has  been  so  difﬁcult  to  achieve  error-free  software  that,  historically,  the
cost of ﬁnding and ﬁxing 
 has been the most time-consuming and expensive aspect of large-scale software
development.
