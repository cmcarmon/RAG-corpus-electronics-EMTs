In the parasitic array in figure 4-31, view A, the parasitic and driven elements are spaced 1/4 
wavelength apart. The radiated signal coming from the driven element strikes the parasitic element after 
1/4 cycle. The voltage developed in the parasitic element is 180 degrees out of phase with that of the 
driven element. This is because of the distance traveled (90 degrees) and because the induced current lags 
the inducing flux by 90 degrees (90 + 90 = 180 degrees). The magnetic field set up by the parasitic 
element induces a voltage in the driven element 1/4 cycle later because the spacing between the elements 
is 1/4 wavelength. This induced voltage is in phase with that in the driven element and causes an increase 
in radiation in the direction indicated in figure 4-31, view A. Since the direction of the radiated energy is 
stronger in the direction away from the parasitic element (toward the driven element), the parasitic 
element is called a reflector. The radiation pattern as it would appear if you were looking down on the 
antenna is shown in view B. The pattern as it would look if viewed from the ends of the elements is 
shown in view C.
