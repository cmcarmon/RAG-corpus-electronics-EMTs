much less than 0.6 V indicates that the transistor is 
not being supplied with a base bias and, while this 
may be normal for a switching transistor in the ‘off’ 
state, it is indicative of a circuit fault in the case of 
a linear small-signal amplifier stage. In the case of 
oscillators  and  medium/high  power  r.f.  amplifiers 
operating in Class C little or no bias will usually be 
present and, furthermore, the presence of r.f. drive 
during  measurement  can  produce  some  very 
misleading  results.  In  such  cases  it  is  probably 
worth  removing  a  transistor  suspected  of  being 
defective and testing it out of circuit.
