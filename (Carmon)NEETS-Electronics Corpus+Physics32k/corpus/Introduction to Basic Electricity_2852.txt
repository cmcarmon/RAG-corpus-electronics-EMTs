Thus the turns ratio of a step-up transformer is  always 
greater than 1.
EXamPlE:	 A transformer has 400 turns on the pri-
mary and 1200 turns on the secondary. If 120 volts of 
AC current are applied across the primary, what volt-
age is induced into the secondary?
Given
 ES 5 ?
 EP 5 120 V
 NS 5 1200 turns
 NP 5 400 turns
