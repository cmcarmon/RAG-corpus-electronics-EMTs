DYNAMIC MICROPHONE.â€”A cross section of the DYNAMIC or MOVING-COIL 
MICROPHONE is shown in figure 1-35. A coil of fine wire is mounted on the back of the diaphragm and 
located in the magnetic field of a permanent magnet. When sound waves strike the diaphragm, the coil 
moves back and forth cutting the magnetic lines of force. This induces a voltage into the coil that is an 
electrical reproduction of the sound waves.
