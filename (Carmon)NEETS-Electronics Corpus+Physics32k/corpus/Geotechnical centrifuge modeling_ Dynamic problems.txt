For dynamic problems where gravity and accelerations are important, all accelerations must scale as gravity is scaled, i.e.





a

∗


=

g

∗


=


1

L

∗






{\displaystyle a^{*}=g^{*}={\frac {1}{L^{*}}}}

Since acceleration has units of





L

T

2






{\displaystyle {\frac {L}{T^{2}}}}
, it is required that





a

∗


=



L

∗



T

∗
2






{\displaystyle a^{*}={\frac {L^{*}}{T^{*2}}}}

Hence it is required that :





1

L

∗




=



L

∗



T

∗
2






{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{L^{*}}}={\frac {L^{*}}{T^{*2}}}}
, or





T

∗


=

L

∗





{\displaystyle T^{*}=L^{*}\,}

Frequency has units of inverse of time, velocity has units of length per time, so for dynamic problems we also obtain





f

∗


=


1

L

∗






{\displaystyle f^{*}={\frac {1}{L{*}}}}






v

∗


=



L

∗



T

∗




=
1


{\displaystyle v^{*}={\frac {L^{*}}{T{*}}}=1}
