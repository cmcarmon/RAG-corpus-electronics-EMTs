of assumed states can also be applied with other diode models and analysis methods.
To illustrate,
let us use the diode model comprising the ideal diode and both the
0.6-volt source and the resistor Rd shown in Figure 16.9 (see Chapter 4.4.1 for details)
to re-analyze the half-wave rectifier circuit of Figure 16.7.
