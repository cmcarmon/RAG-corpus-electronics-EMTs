However, V 0 in equation 1.2 is the voltage of each wire to
ground, whereas V in equation 1.1 is the voltage between the
two wires. In the three-phase system, the voltage in each wire is
1208 out of phase with each other. Thus, the voltage V between
V 0. Hence,
any two wires of the three-phase system is
