To  determine  the  temperature  differences  encountered  in  the  ï¬‚ow  of  heat  within  electronic  systems,  it  is
necessary  to  recognize  several  different  heat  transfer  mechanisms  and  their  governing  relations.  In  a  typical
system,  heat  removal  from  the  active  regions  of  the  chip(s)  requires  the  use  of  several  mechanisms,  some
operating in series and others in parallel, to transport the generated heat to the coolant.
