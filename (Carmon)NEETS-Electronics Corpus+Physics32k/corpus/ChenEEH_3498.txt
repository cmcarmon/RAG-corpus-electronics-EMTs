The Section ends with a chapter that addresses issues related
to implementation of signal processing algorithms. It is con-
cerned with application-speciÔ¨Åc VLSI architecture, including
programmable digital signal processors, and dedicated signal
processors implemented with VLSI technology. It also provides
a good survey of recent development in VLSI signal processing
technologies.
