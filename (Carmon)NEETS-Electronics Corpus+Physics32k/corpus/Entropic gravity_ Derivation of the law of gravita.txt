The law of gravitation is derived from classical statistical mechanics applied to the holographic principle, that states that the description of a volume of space can be thought of as



N


{\displaystyle N}
bits of binary information, encoded on a boundary to that region, a closed surface of area



A


{\displaystyle A}
. The information is evenly distributed on the surface with each bit requiring an area equal to




ℓ


P



2




{\displaystyle \ell _{\mathrm {P} }^{2}}
, the so-called Planck area, from which



N


{\displaystyle N}
can thus be computed:




N
=
A

/


ℓ


P



2




{\displaystyle N=A/\ell _{\mathrm {P} }^{2}}

where




ℓ


P





{\displaystyle \ell _{\mathrm {P} }}
is the Planck length and



ℏ


{\displaystyle \hbar }
is the reduced Planck constant. The Planck length is defined as:





ℓ


P



=




ℏ
G


c

3







{\displaystyle \ell _{\mathrm {P} }={\sqrt {\frac {\hbar G}{c^{3}}}}}

where



G


{\displaystyle G}
is the universal gravitational constant. When substituted in the equation for



N


{\displaystyle N}
we find:




N
=



A

c

ℏ
G





{\displaystyle N={\frac {Ac^{3}}{\hbar G}}}

The statistical equipartition theorem defines the temperature



T


{\displaystyle T}
of a system with



N


{\displaystyle N}
degrees of freedom in terms of its energy



E


{\displaystyle E}
such that:




E
=


1
2


N

k

B


T


{\displaystyle E={\frac {1}{2}}Nk_{\text{B}}T}

is where




k

B




{\displaystyle k_{\text{B}}}
is the Boltzmann constant. This is the equivalent energy for a mass



M


{\displaystyle M}
according to:




E
=
M

c

{\displaystyle E=Mc^{2}}
.
The effective temperature experienced due to a uniform acceleration in a vacuum field according to the Unruh effect is:




T
=



ℏ
a

π
c

k

B







{\displaystyle T={\frac {\hbar a}{2\pi ck_{\text{B}}}}}
,
where



a


{\displaystyle a}
is that acceleration, which for a mass



m


{\displaystyle m}
would be attributed to a force



F


{\displaystyle F}
according to Newton's second law of motion:




F
=
m
a


{\displaystyle F=ma}
.
Taking the holographic screen to be a sphere of radius



r


{\displaystyle r}
, the surface area would be given by:




A
=
4
π

r

2




{\displaystyle A=4\pi r^{2}}
.
From algebraic substitution of these into the above relations, one derives from first principles Newton's law of universal gravitation:




F
=
G



m
M


r

2






{\displaystyle F=G{\frac {mM}{r^{2}}}}
.
