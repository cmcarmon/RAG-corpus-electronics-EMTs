Integrated Circuits
Monolithic ICs are fabricated on single chips of silicon or dice (the singular being die). This means that the
active and passive structures on the chips are manufactured all at the same time, so it is easy to ensure that a
large number of such structures are identical, or bear some ﬁxed ratio to one another, but it is more difﬁcult
to establish precise values for such sets of structures. For example, a set of transistors may all exhibit almost
the  same  values  of  hFE,  but  the  actual  numerical  value  of  hFE  may  be  subject  to  wider  tolerances.  Similarly,
many  pairs  of  resistors  may  bear  a  ratio  n:1  to  each  other,  but  the  actual  values  of  these  resistors  are  more
difﬁcult to deﬁne. So, in IC design, it is very desirable to exploit the close similarity of devices (or close ratios)
rather  than  depend  upon  their  having  predictable  absolute  values.  This  approach  has  led  to  two  ubiquitous
circuit conﬁgurations, both of which depend upon device similarity: the long-tailed pair or difference ampliﬁer
(often called the differential ampliﬁer), and the current mirror. This section will treat both, and the former is
best introduced by considering the degenerate common-emitter stage.
