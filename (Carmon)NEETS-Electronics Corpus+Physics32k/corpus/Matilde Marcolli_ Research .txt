Marcolli's research work has covered different areas of mathematics and theoretical physics: gauge theory and low-dimensional topology, algebraic-geometric structures in quantum field theory, noncommutative geometry with applications to number theory and to physics models, especially related to particle physics, quantum gravity and cosmology, and to the quantum Hall effect. She has collaborated with several other mathematicians and physicists, among them Yuri I. Manin and Alain Connes. Ten graduate students obtained their PhD under her supervision between 2006 and 2010.
