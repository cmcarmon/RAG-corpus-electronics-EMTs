If the average bit energy is Eb and both symbols are equiprobable, then the distance between the elements
of the signal set is 2Eb. It is well-known from the theory of communications systems that the greater the distance
between the elements of the signal set, the better the noise performance of a modulation scheme [1]. The noise
