Any number of elements can be variously connected; if we
consider on such a network an input port and an output port,
we will have a general two-port. This two-port has four vari-
ables, V1, V2, I1, and I2, as in Figure 4.3. Any two can be
selected as independent variables, and the other two will be
dependent variables. For instance, we can consider both cur-
rents as independent variables, which will make the voltages
dependent variables. To couple them in a most general form,
we can write the following:
