Transconductance is a measure of the change in plate current to a change in grid voltage, with plate
voltage held constant. The unit for conductance is the mho (siemens), pronounced "moe."
Transconductance is normally expressed in either micromhos or millimhos. Mathematically,
transconductance is expressed by the formula:
