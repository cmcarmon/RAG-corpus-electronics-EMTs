The increasing demand on data communication system capacity and ﬂexibility is dictating the development
of  a  system  without  the  numerous  limitations  of  current  systems.  Current  communication  systems  require
rather rigid protocols, message formatting, and addressing. The need for a more ﬂexible and capable system
has led to the initial work to develop an Aeronautical Telecommunications Network (ATN). The characteristics
envisaged for the ATN are the initiation, transport, and application of virtually any type of digital message in
an apparently seamless method between virtually any two end systems. The ATN is expected to be a continually
evolving system.
