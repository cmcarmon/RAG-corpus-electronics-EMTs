A common misunderstanding is that while a signal exists in both the time and frequency domains, a single
formula expressing a signal must contain only time or frequency: Both cannot be present simultaneously.
This situation mirrors what happens with complex amplitudes in circuits: As we reveal how communications
systems work and are designed, we will deﬁne signals entirely in the frequency domain without explicitly ﬁnd-
ing their time domain variants. This idea is shown in Section 4.6, where we deﬁne Fourier series coeﬃcients
according to letter to be transmitted. Thus, a signal, though most familiarly deﬁned in the time-domain,
really can be deﬁned equally as well (and sometimes more easily) in the frequency domain. For example,
impedances depend on frequency and the time variable cannot appear.
