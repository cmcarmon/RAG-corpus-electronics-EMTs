LAN is a communication network that supports variety of
devices within a small area. The small area could be a single
building or a campus. MAN is the communication network
that spans a larger geographic area than LAN and could be an
area consisting of a few blocks of buildings or even a large
metropolitan area. The characteristics of LAN are high data
rate, short distance, low error rate, shared medium, and single
organization ownership (typically).
