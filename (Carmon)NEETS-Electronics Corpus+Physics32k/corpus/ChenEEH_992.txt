With advances in CMOS technology, the potential packing
densities increase as the feature size of the MOS devices
shrinks, as shown in Figure 5.1. These increases and decreases
validate what Gordon Moore once said in the 1960s: the
number of transistors that can be integrated on a single die
would grow exponentially with time (Moore, 1965). The
example that amazingly proved his visionary prediction is
best illustrated by tracking the historical evolution of inte-
grated circuit (IC) design in the company he founded in
1972, Intel, and by using the trends in memory evolution.
Such observations are evident in Figure 5.2. Figure 5.2(A)
shows the trend in the IC logic complexity evolution for Intel
processors in the last two decades, whereas Figure 5.2(B) shows
the memory integration density as a function of time.
