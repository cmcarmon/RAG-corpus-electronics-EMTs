Prior to the middle 17th century, scientists thought that light required no time at all to pass from the
source to the observer. Then in 1675, Ole Roemer, a Danish astronomer, discovered that light travels
approximately 186,000 miles per second in space. At this velocity, a light beam can circle the earth 7 1/2
times in one second.
