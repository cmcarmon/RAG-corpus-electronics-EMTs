Microprocessors are well suited as the controller for such tasks because of their cost and ﬂexibility. Sufﬁcient
numbers  of  processors  may  be  used  to  allow  real-time  data  acquisition.  Because  the  microprocessor  is  pro-
grammable, sensors may be added, removed, or rearranged without major system impact. Finally, because the
microprocessor  is  a  computational  device,  calculations  may  be  performed  on  the  recorded  data  to  produce
useful information, such as calculating speed from distance and time. In the next section we will examine the
components of one such system, the retail point-of-sale terminal [Hordeski, 1984].
