At T2 the input signal changes from +25 volts to −25 volts. The input is now SERIES OPPOSING 
with the +23 volts across C1. This leaves an output voltage of −2 volts (−25 plus +23 volts). The cathode 
of D1 is negative with respect to the anode and D1 conducts. From T2 to T3, C1 quickly charges through 
D1 from +23 volts to +25 volts; the output voltage changes from −2 volts to 0 volts.
