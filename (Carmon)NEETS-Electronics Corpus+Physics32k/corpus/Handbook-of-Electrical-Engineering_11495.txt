Classiﬁcation/Reimbursement (e.g., ICD, DRG, SNOMED, CPT, DSM, RCS, UMLS)
ICDs were originally used for public health morbidity statistics; now in the United States they are primarily
used for reimbursement. Its structure is numbered classiﬁcation of diseases grouped by anatomical areas. The
DRGs facilitate the deﬁnition of case-mix for hospital reimbursement. Its structure is multi-axial: severity of
illness,  prognosis,  treatment  difﬁculty,  need  for  intervention,  and  resource  intensity.  SNOMED  provides
description of pathological tests related to patient identiﬁcation. It has four axes: function (primary symptoms),
etiology  (cause  of  disease),  morphology  (description  of  disease  form),  and  topology  (area  of  body).  CPT  is
primarily used for reimbursement and utilization review. It derives codes from specialty nomenclatures divided
into chapters: systemic (medicine, anesthesia, etc.), topological (cardiovascular, lymphatic, etc.), and technological
