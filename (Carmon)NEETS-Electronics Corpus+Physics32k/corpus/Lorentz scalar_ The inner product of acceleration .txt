Therefore, we can regard acceleration in spacetime as simply a rotation of the 4-velocity. The inner product of the acceleration and the velocity is a Lorentz scalar and is zero. This rotation is simply an expression of energy conservation:

{\displaystyle {dE \over d\tau }=\mathbf {F} \cdot {\mathbf {v} }}

where



E


{\displaystyle E}
is the energy of a particle and




F



{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} }
is the 3-force on the particle.
