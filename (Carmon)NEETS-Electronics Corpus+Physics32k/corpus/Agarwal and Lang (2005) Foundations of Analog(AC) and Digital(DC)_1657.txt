e x e r c i s e 11.1 An inverter built using an NMOS transistor and a resistor RL
drives a capacitance CL. The power supply voltage is VS and the on resistance of the
MOSFET is RON. The threshold voltage for the MOSFET is VT. Assume that logical
0’s are represented using 0 V and logical 1’s using VS volts.
