where V1 and V2 are the input voltages (note that all 
of  the  resistors  used  in  the  circuit  have  the  same 
value).  Typical  input  and  output  waveforms  for  a 
summing  amplifier  are  shown  in  Fig.  8.20.  A 
typical  application  is  that  of  ‘mixing’  two  input 
signals to produce an output voltage that is the sum 
of the two.
