Analysis of nonlinear circuits is more difﬁcult than the an-
alysis of linear circuits. Various tools have been used to under-
stand and capture nonlinear circuit behavior. Some approaches
employ quantitative (numerical) techniques and the use of
circuit simulators for ﬁnding the distribution of a circuit’s
currents and voltages for a variety of waveforms supplied by
sources. Other tools employ qualitative analyses methods, such
as those dealing with the theory for establishing the number of
dc operating points a circuit may possess or dealing with the
analysis of stability of a circuit’s operating point.
