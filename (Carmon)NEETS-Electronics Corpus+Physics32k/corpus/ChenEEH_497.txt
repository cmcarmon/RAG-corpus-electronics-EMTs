In 1873, the British engineer Willoughby Smith discovered
that the resistivity of selenium, a semiconductor material, is
very sensitive to light. In 1875, Werner von Siemens invented a
selenium photometer, and, in 1878, Alexander Graham Bell
used this device for a wireless telephone communication
system. The discovery of a bipolar junction transistor by the
American scientists John Bardeen, Walter Houser Brattain, and
William Bradford Shockley in 1947 led to a revolution in
electronics, and, soon after, semiconductor devices largely re-
placed electronic tubes.
