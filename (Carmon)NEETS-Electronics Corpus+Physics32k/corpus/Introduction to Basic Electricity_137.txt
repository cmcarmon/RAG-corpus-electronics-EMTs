A	conflict	regarding	electromagnetism	is	that,	despite	agreeing	to	Albert	Einsteinâ€™s
Special	Relativity,	it	goes	against	some	of	the	rules	of	mechanics;	it	is	only
dependent	on	the	electromagnetic	permeability	of	0	space.	It	follows	that	in	the
case	of	moving	frames,	the	electromagnetic	field	is	subjected	to	transformation	to
include	space.
Moreover,	all	electromagnetic	phenomena	are	covered	under	quantum	mechanics.
This	makes	the	electromagnetic	field	of	a	circuit	accountable	for	the	physical
phenomena	that	are	observable,	especially	magnetism	and	electricity.
