cients, where the more likely values are represented with a
smaller number of bits and the less likely values are represented
with a larger number of bits, we can effectively obtain a reduc-
tion on the number of bits used. It is well known from infor-
mation theory (Thomas and Joy, 1991) that, by properly
choosing a code, one can encode a source using a number of
bits arbitrarily close to its entropy, deÔ¨Åned as:
