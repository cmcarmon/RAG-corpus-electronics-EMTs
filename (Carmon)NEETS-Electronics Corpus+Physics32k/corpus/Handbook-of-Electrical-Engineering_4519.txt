Differential-Equation Model
A  DE  MoM  model,  being  based  on  the  deﬁning  Maxwell’s  equations,  requires  intrinsically  less  analytical
manipulation than does derivation of an IE model. Numerical implementation of a DE model, however, can
differ signiﬁcantly from that used for an IE formulation in a number of ways for several reasons:
