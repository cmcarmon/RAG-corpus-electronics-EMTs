In Bode analysis complex conjugate poles or zeros are always treated as pairs in the corresponding quadratic
form [(s/wn)2 + (2z/wn)s + 1].1 For quadratic terms in stable, minimum phase systems, the damping ratio z
(Greek letter zeta) is within the range 0 < z < 1. Quadratic terms cannot always be adequately represented by
straight  line  approximations.  This  is  especially  true  for  lightly  damped  systems  (small  z).  The  traditional
approach was to draw a preliminary representation of the contribution. This consists of a straight line of 0 dB
from dc up to the breakpoint at wn followed by a straight line of slope –40 dB/decade beyond the breakpoint,
depending on whether the plot refers to a pair of poles or a pair of zeros. Then, referring to a family of curves
as  shown  in  Fig.  11.5,  the  preliminary  representation  was  improved  based  on  the  value  of  z.  The  phase
contribution of the quadratic term was similarly constructed. Note that Fig. 11.5 presents frequency response
contributions for a quadratic pair of poles. For zeros in the corresponding locations, both the magnitude and
phase curves would be negated. Digital computer applications programs render this procedure unnecessary for
purposes of constructing frequency response curves. Knowledge of the technique is still valuable, however, in
the qualitative and quantitative interpretation of frequency response curves. Localized peaking in the gain curve
is  a  reﬂection  of  the  existence  of  resonance  in  a  system.  The  height  of  such  a  peak  (and  the  corresponding
value of z) is a direct indication of the degree of resonance.
