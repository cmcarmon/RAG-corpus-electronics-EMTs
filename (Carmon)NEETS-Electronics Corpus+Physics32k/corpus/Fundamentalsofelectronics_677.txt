Figure 5.22: The noisy input signal is sectioned into length-48 frames, each of which is ﬁltered using
frequency-domain techniques. Each ﬁltered section is added to other outputs that overlap to create the
signal equivalent to having ﬁltered the entire input. The sinusoidal component of the signal is shown as
the red dashed line.
