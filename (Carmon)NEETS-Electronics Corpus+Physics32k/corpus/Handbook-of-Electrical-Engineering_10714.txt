Position-location  and  position-reporting  systems  monitor  the  state  vectors  of  many  vehicles  and  usually
display the data in a control room or dispatch center. Some vehicles derive their state vector from the ranging

avoidance algorithms. The table also lists the U.S. NASA and military spacecraft-tracking networks (STDN and
SCN). Tracking and reporting systems have long been in use at marine ports, for airplane trafﬁc control and
for  space  vehicles.  They  are  increasingly  being  installed  in  ﬁre  trucks,  police  cars,  ambulances,  and  delivery-
