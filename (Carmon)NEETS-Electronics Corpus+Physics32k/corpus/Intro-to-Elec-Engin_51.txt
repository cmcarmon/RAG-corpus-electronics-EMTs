Conductors and Insulators
In order to put charge in motion so that it becomes an electric current, one must provide a path
through which it can ﬂow easily by the movement of electrons. Materials through which charge
ﬂows readily are called conductors. Examples include most metals, such as silver, gold, copper,
and aluminum. Copper is used extensively for the conductive paths on electric circuit boards and
for the fabrication of electrical wires.
