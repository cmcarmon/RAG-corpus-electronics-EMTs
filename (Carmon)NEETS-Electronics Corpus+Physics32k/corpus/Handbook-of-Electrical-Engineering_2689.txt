In addition to the drawing commands, often a layout system provides tools for minimizing the overall area
of the layout (i.e., size of the chip). Today a VLSI chip consists of a lot of individual cells, with each one laid
out separately. A cell can be an inverter, a NAND gate, a multiplier, a memory unit, etc. The designer can make
the layout of a cell and then store it in a ﬁle called the 
 Later, each time the designer wants to design
a  circuit  that  requires  the  stored  cell,  he  or  she  simply  copies  the  layout  from  the  cell  library. A  layout  may

consist of many cells. Most of the layout systems provide routines, called 
routines, for placing the cells and then interconnecting them with wires in such a way that minimizes the layout
area.  As  an  example,  Fig. 25.8  presents  the  placement  of  three  cells.  The  area  between  the  cells  is  used  for
routing. The entire routing surface is divided into a set of rectangular routing areas called channels. The sides

of each channel consist of a set of terminals. A wire that connects the terminals with the same
net. The router ﬁnds a location for the wire segments of each net within the channel. The following sections
classify various types of placement and routing techniques and provide an overview of the main steps of some
of these techniques.
