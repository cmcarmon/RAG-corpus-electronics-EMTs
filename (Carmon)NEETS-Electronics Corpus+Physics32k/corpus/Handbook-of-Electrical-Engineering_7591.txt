heat  dissipation  problems  in  high-density  chips.  Also  a  noteworthy  feature  of  CMOS  digital  circuits  is  the
absence of components other than FETs. This attribute, which is shared by PMOS and NMOS, accounts for
the much higher function/chip area density than is possible with TTL or ECL. During the time the output of
a CMOS gate is switching there will be current ﬂow from VDD to VSS, partly due to the charging of junction
capacitances and partly because the path between VDD and VSS closes momentarily as the FETs turn on and off.
This  causes  the  dc  supply  current  to  increase  in  proportion  to  the  switching  frequency  in  a  CMOS  circuit.
Manufacturers specify that the supply voltage for standard CMOS can range over 3 V £ VDD – VSS £ 18 V, but
switching speeds are slower at the lower voltages, mainly due to the increased resistances of the “on” transistors.
The output switches between low and high when the input is midway between VDD and VSS, and the output
logical 1 level will be VDD and the logical 0 level VSS [Fig. 79.13(c)]. If CMOS is operated with VDD = 5 V and
VSS = 0 V, the VDD and VSS levels will be almost compatible with TTL except that the TTL totem-pole output
high of 3.4 V is marginal as a logical 1 for CMOS. To alleviate this, when CMOS is driven with TTL a 3.3-kW
pull-up resistor between the TTL output and the common VCC, VDD supply terminal should be used. This raises
VOH of the TTL output to 5 V.
