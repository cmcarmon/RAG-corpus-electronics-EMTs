It is very economically infeasible to have one dedicated phys-
ical link between any two computers on a network. Network-
ing nodes and the transmission facility must be shared.
Multiplexing allows for a physical link to be shared by mul-
tiple users to fully use the link and reduce the number of input/
output (I/O) ports required for a computer. Switching tech-
niques avoid a creation of the mesh or complete topology
where two computers are directly connected in a network.
Direct connection increase the cost of I/O ports on each
computer and transmission links. Multiplexing is also very
inï¬‚exible without the use of switching if the direct link be-
tween two computers is broken.
