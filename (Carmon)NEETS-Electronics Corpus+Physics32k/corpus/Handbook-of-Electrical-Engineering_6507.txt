A  variety  of  more  complicated  receiver  designs  can  reduce  the
noise  current  appreciably  [Kasper,  1988].  The  example  shown  in

the voltage developed by the signal current at the FET input. Input
capacitance becomes a limitation by shunting high-frequency com-
ponents of signal current. High-frequency signals are then reduced
with respect to the noise generated in the FET, resulting in poor high-
frequency  performance.  Various  impedance  matching  techniques
have  been  proposed  to  maximize  the  CNR  for  speciÔ¨Åc  frequency
ranges.
