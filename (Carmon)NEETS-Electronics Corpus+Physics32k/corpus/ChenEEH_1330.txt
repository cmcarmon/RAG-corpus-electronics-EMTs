. A modem is a device that connects two computers to-
gether over a telephone line by converting the computerâ€™s
data into an audio signal and vice versa. Modems operate
at data rates from 28,800 bps to 57600 bps. Most of them
are full duplex although some networks might still need
to support half-duplex modems. There is also another
device known as cable modem that converts the digital
signal into analog, which can be transmitted through
coaxial cable.
