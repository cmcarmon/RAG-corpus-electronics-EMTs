Point-of-Sale Terminal
The function of a point-of-sale (POS) terminal is characteristic of the applications under the category of data
collection.  The  microprocessor  is  not  being  used  for  intensive  computations,  nor  for  controlling  a  complex
process, but rather to collect data, perform some processing, and then pass the results on to a central collector.
The cost and ï¬‚exibility of the microprocessor make it an excellent choice over special-purpose hardware.
