System reliability may be viewed from two perspectives: short-term reliability and long-term reliability. The
system  operator  is  primarily  concerned  with  real-time  security  aspects  in  the  short  term,  that  is,  supplying
steady, uninterrupted service under existing operating conditions and as they occur over the next few minutes,
hours,  days,  or  months.  The  transmission  planning  engineer,  however,  is  concerned  not  only  with  security
aspects in the short term but also adequacy and security aspects in the long term, as many as 25 or more years
into the future.
