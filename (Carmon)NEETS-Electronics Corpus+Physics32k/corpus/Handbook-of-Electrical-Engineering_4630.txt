 is the reference distance used in deﬁning the source level. Equation
where 
(46.5) has a number of useful consequences: (1) the receiving and transmitting beam patterns of a reciprocal
S
transducer are identical, (2) a transducer cannot be simultaneously ﬂat as a receiver and transmitter since 
w
has an additional factor of 
, and (3) Eq. (46.5) provides the basis for the three-transducer reciprocity calibration
technique  whereby  an  absolute  calibration  of  a  hydrophone  or  microphone  can  be  obtained  from  purely
electrical measurements.
