Meters are either SELF-EXCITED or EXTERNALLY EXCITED. Self-excited meters operate from
their own power sources. Externally excited meters get their power from the circuit to which they are
connected. Most common meters (voltmeters, ammeters, and ohmmeters) that you use in your work
operate on the electromagnetic principle. All measuring instruments must have some form of indicating
device, usually a meter, to be of any use to you. The most basic indicating device used in instruments that
measure current and voltage operates by using the interaction between the magnetic fields associated with
current flow in the circuit. Before continuing, you might want to review the properties of magnetism and
electromagnetism in NEETS, Module 1, Introduction to Matter, Energy, and Direct Current.
