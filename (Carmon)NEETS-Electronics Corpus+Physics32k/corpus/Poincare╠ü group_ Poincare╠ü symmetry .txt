Poincaré symmetry is the full symmetry of special relativity. It includes:
translations (displacements) in time and space (P), forming the abelian Lie group of translations on space-time;
rotations in space, forming the non-Abelian Lie group of three-dimensional rotations (J);
boosts, transformations connecting two uniformly moving bodies (K).
The last two symmetries, J and K, together make the Lorentz group (see also Lorentz invariance); the semi-direct product of the translations group and the Lorentz group then produce the Poincaré group. Objects which are invariant under this group are then said to possess Poincaré invariance or relativistic invariance.
