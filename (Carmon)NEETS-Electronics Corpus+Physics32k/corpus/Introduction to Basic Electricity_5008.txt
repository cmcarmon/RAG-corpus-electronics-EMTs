Traces that are placed close together may short out and 
can electrically short to each other. The traces can also act 
as antennas and capacitors. High-speed digital lines next 
to high-impedance analog lines will cause problems. Long 
traces have the same problems as long wires. They pick 
up noise and have noticeable impedance. Even though a 
digital design only runs at 1 MHz, the changing state will 
cause transients in the GHz range.
