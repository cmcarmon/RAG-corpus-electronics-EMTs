In mathematics a rotating body is commonly represented by a vector along the axis of rotation. The length of the vector gives the speed of rotation and the direction of the axis gives the direction of rotation according to the right-hand rule: right fingers curled in the direction of rotation and the right thumb pointing in the positive direction of the axis. This allows some easy calculations using the vector cross product. Note that no part of the body is moving in the direction of the axis arrow, which takes some getting used to. By coincidence, if your thumb points north the earth rotates according to the right-hand rule. This causes the sun and stars to appear to revolve according to the left-hand rule.
