The collision between trains 608 and 653 happened on kilometer 8.055 at 17:42 (some sources says at 17:44). The speed of the steam train 608 was about 55 km/h, train 653 about 60 km/h. Both drivers braked, but it was too late.
The train 608 driver and fireman survived almost unhurt, because the locomotive's construction, especially its long boiler, saved them. The first car (mail) was seriously damaged and derailed. The next car (freight) collided with and demolished the mail car in front of it. The third car (first passenger) was almost totally demolished by the fourth (service) car. The fifth car ran up on the fourth from behind. The remaining seven cars sustained little or no damage.
Train 653 experienced much worse damage. Its first railcar was lifted on top of the forward part of train 608's steam locomotive. The first passenger car crashed into the locomotive's side, and next three passenger cars collided with it and were totally crushed. The rearmost railcar cut loose and stayed on the track.
In order to prevent a boiler explosion, the steam machine driver and fireman dumped their firebox on the ground. The hot coals and ashes ignited diesel fuel leaking from the first railcar, and the train burst into flame.
