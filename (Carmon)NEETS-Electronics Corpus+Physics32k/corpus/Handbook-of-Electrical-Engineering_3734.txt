Yet another solution to the saturation problem of ferrite heads is to use thin-ﬁlm heads. Thin-ﬁlm heads
are made of Permalloy and are therefore metallic, but the ﬁlms are made sufﬁciently thin that they are thinner
than  the  skin  depth  and,  consequently,  the  heads  operate  well  at  high  frequencies. A  diagram  of  a  thin-ﬁlm
head is shown in Fig. 36.13. It consists of a bottom yoke of Permalloy, some insulating layers, a spiral conductor,
and a top yoke of Permalloy, which is joined to the bottom yoke at the back gap but separated from it by a
thin insulator at the recording gap. These thin-ﬁlm heads are made using photolithography and microfabrica-
tion techniques similar to those used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices. The thin pole tips of these
heads  actually  sharpen  the  head  ﬁeld  function  and,  consequently,  the  pulse  shape  produced  by  an  isolated
transition,  although  at  the  expense  of  some  undershoot,  as  illustrated  in  Fig. 36.14.  Because  thin-ﬁlm  heads
are made by photolithographic techniques, they can be made extremely small and to have low inductance. This,
too, helps extend the frequency of operation.
