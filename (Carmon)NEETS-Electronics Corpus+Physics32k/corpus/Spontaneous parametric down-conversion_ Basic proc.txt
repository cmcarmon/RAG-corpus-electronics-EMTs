A nonlinear crystal is used to split photon beams into pairs of photons that, in accordance with the law of conservation of energy and law of conservation of momentum, have combined energies and momenta equal to the energy and momentum of the original photon and crystal lattice, are phase-matched in the frequency domain, and have correlated polarizations. The state of the crystal is unchanged by the process. If the photons share the same polarization it is deemed Type I correlation; if they have perpendicular polarizations it is deemed Type II. There is no polarization correlation between successive photon sets.
The conversion efficiency of SPDC is typically very low, on the order of 1 pair per 106 incoming photons for PPLN in waveguides.  However, if one half of the pair (the "signal") is detected at any time then its partner (the "idler") is known to be present. The output of a Type I down converter is a squeezed vacuum that contains only even photon number terms. The output of the Type II down converter is a two-mode squeezed vacuum.
