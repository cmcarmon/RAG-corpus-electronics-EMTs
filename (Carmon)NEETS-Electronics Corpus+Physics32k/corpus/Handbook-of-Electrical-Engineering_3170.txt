Power supplies are used in many industrial and aerospace applications and also in consumer products. Some
of the requirements of power supplies are small size, light weight, low cost, and high power conversion efﬁciency.
In  addition  to  these,  some  power  supplies  require  the  following:  electrical  isolation  between  the  source  and
load, low harmonic distortion for the input and output waveforms, and high power factor (PF) if the source
is ac voltage. Some special power supplies require controlled direction of power ﬂow.
