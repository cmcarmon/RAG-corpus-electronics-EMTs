A variety of VLSI CAD systems are commercially available that perform all or some of the levels of abstraction
A layout-editor is software
of design. Most of these systems support a 
that  provides  commands  for  drawing  lines  and  boxes,  copying  objects,  moving  objects,  erasing  unwanted
objects, and so on. The output of such an editor is a design ﬁle that describes the layout. Usually, the design
ﬁle  is  represented  in  a  standard  format,  called  Caltech  Intermediate  Form  (CIF),  which  is  accepted  by  the
fabrication industry.
