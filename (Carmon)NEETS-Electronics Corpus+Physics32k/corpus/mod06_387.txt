8. The Aquadag Coatingâ€”in the CRT, this coating performs the same function as the suppressor
grid in conventional tubes; namely, eliminating the effects of secondary emission. In
conventional tubes, the suppressor grid is negatively charged and repels secondary emission
electrons back to the plate. In the CRT, the aquadag is positively charged and attracts secondary
emission away from the screen.
