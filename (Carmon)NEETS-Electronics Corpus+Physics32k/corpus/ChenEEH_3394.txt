It may seem that ideally the ACE in B would be zero and that
in A it would precisely match the load change; however, this is
not practical or particularly necessary. Instead, the ACE is
integrated over time, and this signal is used to determine the
generator set points. Integrating the error ensures that the
actual energy exchange between areas is precisely maintained
over time. Since the control center must calculate the ACE
after gathering data from the system, the set point controls are
discrete. In North America, the AGC signals are fed to the units
typically, about once every 2â€“4 sec. In many parts of the world,
such frequent adjustment is considered excessive, and supple-
mentary control signals are sent over much less frequent time
intervals. In each country, regulating agencies determine the
required performance of the AGC so that utilities do not
