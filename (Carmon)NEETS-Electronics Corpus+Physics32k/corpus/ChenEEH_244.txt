Figure 1.5 shows the practical VRM load model (processor
model). The packaging capacitor is the parasitic capacitor
inside the microprocessor package. There are several decoup-
ling capacitors near and around the microprocessors to reduce
noise and maintain voltage regulation. Bulk capacitors are VRM
output capacitors. In very high-speed and high-current systems,
physical capacitors can no longer be simpliÔ¨Åed as ideal capaci-
