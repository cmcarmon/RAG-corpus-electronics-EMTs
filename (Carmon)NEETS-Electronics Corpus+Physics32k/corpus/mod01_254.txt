The color of the first band indicates the value of the first significant digit. The color of the second
band indicates the value of the second significant digit. The third color band represents a decimal
multiplier by which the first two digits must be multiplied to obtain the resistance value of the resistor.
The colors for the bands and their corresponding values are shown in Table 1-1.
