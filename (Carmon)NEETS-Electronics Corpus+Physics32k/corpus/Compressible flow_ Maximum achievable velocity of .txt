Ultimately, because of the energy conservation law, a gas is limited to a certain maximum velocity based on its energy content. The maximum velocity, Vmax, that a gas can attain is:





V

m
a
x


=


2

c

p



T

t






{\displaystyle V_{max}={\sqrt {2c_{p}T_{t}}}}

where cp is the specific heat of the gas and Tt is the stagnation temperature of the flow.
