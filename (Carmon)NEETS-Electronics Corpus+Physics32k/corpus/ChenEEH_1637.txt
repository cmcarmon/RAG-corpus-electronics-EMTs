As far as the symbol encoding is concerned, the standard
speciﬁes the use of either Huffman or arithmetic encoding.
Realizing the fact that image data applications are computa-
tion intensive and performing the Huffman encoding for each
block of 8  8 pixels might not be practical in most situations,
the specs provide standard Huffman encoding tables for lumi-
nance (Y) and for chrominance (U and V) data. The experi-
mentally proven code tables based on the average statistics of a
large number of video images with 8 bits per pixel depth yield
satisfactory results in most practical situations. For the dc
encoding, the difference of each block’s dc coefﬁcient with
the previous one is encoded. This code is then output in two
successive bunches: one for the size of this code and the
succeeding one for the most signiﬁcant bits of the exact code.
Since ac coefﬁcients normally contain many zeros scattered
between nonzero coefﬁcients, the technique to encode ac coef-
ﬁcients takes into account the run of zeros between current
and upcoming ac coefﬁcients.
