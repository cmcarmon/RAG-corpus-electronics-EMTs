Mean Active Maintenance Down Time is associated with Planned Maintenance System support philosophy. This is average amount of time while the system is not 100% operational because of diagnostic testing that requires down time.
For example, an automobile that requires 1 day of maintenance every 90 days has a Mean Active Maintenance Down Time of just over 1%.
This is separate from the type of down time associated with repair activities.
