The signiﬁcant digits in a real-world measurement are typically reﬂective of the accuracy of
that measurement. For example, if we were to say that a car weighs 3,000 pounds, we probably
don’t mean that the car in question weighs exactly 3,000 pounds, but that we’ve rounded its
weight to a value more convenient to say and remember. That rounded ﬁgure of 3,000 has only
one signiﬁcant digit: the ”3” in front – the zeros merely serve as placeholders. However, if we
were to say that the car weighed 3,005 pounds, the fact that the weight is not rounded to the
nearest thousand pounds tells us that the two zeros in the middle aren’t just placeholders, but
that all four digits of the number ”3,005” are signiﬁcant to its representative accuracy. Thus,
the number ”3,005” is said to have four signiﬁcant ﬁgures.
