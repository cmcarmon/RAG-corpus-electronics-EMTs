Various reflected and refracted components of the propagated wave create effects of reinforcement 
and cancellation. At certain distant points from the transmitter, some of the wave components meet in 
space. Reception at these points is either impaired or improved. If the different components arrive at a 
given point in the same phase, they add, making a stronger signal available. If they arrive out of phase, 
they cancel, reducing the signal strength.
