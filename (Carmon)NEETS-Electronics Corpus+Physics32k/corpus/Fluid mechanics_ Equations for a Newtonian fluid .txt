The constant of proportionality between the viscous stress tensor and the velocity gradient is known as the viscosity. A simple equation to describe incompressible Newtonian fluid behaviour is




τ
=
−
μ



d
v


d
y





{\displaystyle \tau =-\mu {\frac {dv}{dy}}}

where




τ


{\displaystyle \tau }
is the shear stress exerted by the fluid ("drag")




μ


{\displaystyle \mu }
is the fluid viscosity – a constant of proportionality







d
v


d
y





{\displaystyle {\frac {dv}{dy}}}
is the velocity gradient perpendicular to the direction of shear.
For a Newtonian fluid, the viscosity, by definition, depends only on temperature and pressure, not on the forces acting upon it. If the fluid is incompressible the equation governing the viscous stress (in Cartesian coordinates) is

{\displaystyle \tau _{ij}=\mu \left({\frac {\partial v_{i}}{\partial x_{j}}}+{\frac {\partial v_{j}}{\partial x_{i}}}\right)}

where

If the fluid is not incompressible the general form for the viscous stress in a Newtonian fluid is

{\displaystyle \tau _{ij}=\mu \left({\frac {\partial v_{i}}{\partial x_{j}}}+{\frac {\partial v_{j}}{\partial x_{i}}}-{\frac {2}{3}}\delta _{ij}\nabla \cdot \mathbf {v} \right)+\kappa \delta _{ij}\nabla \cdot \mathbf {v} }

where



κ


{\displaystyle \kappa }
is the second viscosity coefficient (or bulk viscosity). If a fluid does not obey this relation, it is termed a non-Newtonian fluid, of which there are several types. Non-Newtonian fluids can be either plastic, Bingham plastic, pseudoplastic, dilatant, thixotropic, rheopectic, viscoelastic.
In some applications another rough broad division among fluids is made: ideal and non-ideal fluids. An Ideal fluid is non-viscous and offers no resistance whatsoever to a shearing force. An ideal fluid really does not exist, but in some calculations, the assumption is justifiable. One example of this is the flow far from solid surfaces. In many cases the viscous effects are concentrated near the solid boundaries (such as in boundary layers) while in regions of the flow field far away from the boundaries the viscous effects can be neglected and the fluid there is treated as it were inviscid (ideal flow). When the viscosity is negleted, the term containing the viscous stress tensor

in the Navier–Stokes equation vanishes. The equation reduced in this form is called the Euler equation.
