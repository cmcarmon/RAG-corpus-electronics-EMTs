Now, when S1 is closed and S2 is opened, we have two subcircuits operating. The first
circuit is a series RL circuit identical to the original circuit. The second circuit is an RC
circuit in which the capacitor discharges through the load resistor RL. Depending on the
exact values of the charging and discharging capacitor time constants, we might obtain
the waveform shown in Figure 12.49 at the output port. The waveform in the figure
assumes that RLC (cid:9) t0, where t0 is the time interval for which S2 is open.
