The E and D fields are related by the permittivity of the material, ε.
For linear, homogeneous, isotropic materials E and D are proportional and constant throughout the region, there is no position dependence: For inhomogeneous materials, there is a position dependence throughout the material:





D
(
r
)

=
ε

E
(
r
)



{\displaystyle \mathbf {D(r)} =\varepsilon \mathbf {E(r)} }

For anisotropic materials the E and D fields are not parallel, and so E and D are related by the permittivity tensor (a 2nd order tensor field), in component form:





D

=

ε

i
j



E

{\displaystyle D_{i}=\varepsilon _{ij}E_{j}}

For non-linear media, E and D are not proportional. Materials can have varying extents of linearity, homogeneity and isotropy.
