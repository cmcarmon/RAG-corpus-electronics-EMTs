Since certain fundamental characteristics indicate the condition of semiconductors, test equipment is
available that allows you to test these characteristics with the semiconductors in or out of their circuits.
Crystal-rectifier testers normally allow you to test only the forward-to-reverse current ratio of the crystal.
Transistor testers, however, allow you to measure several characteristics, such as the collector leakage
current (Ic), collector to base current gain ( b ), and the four-terminal network parameters. The most useful
test characteristic is determined by the type of circuit in which the transistor will be used. Thus, the
alternating-current beta measurement is preferred for ac amplifier or oscillator applications; and for
switching-circuit applications, a direct-current beta measurement may prove more useful.
