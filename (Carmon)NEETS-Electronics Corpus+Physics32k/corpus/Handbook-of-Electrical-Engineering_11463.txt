Silicon Drift Detectors
Silicon drift detectors were ﬁrst proposed by Gatti and Rehak [32] as an alternative to silicon strip detectors in
high-energy physics experiments. The primary motivation was to signiﬁcantly reduce the number of readout
channels. Drift detectors have subsequently been adapted for X-ray spectroscopy. These detectors are usually
fabricated on n-type silicon wafers with holes collected to either a p+ contact on the back side of the detector,
or to concentric annular p+ contacts on the front side. The detector is depleted from both sides. The reverse
bias applied to the p+ annular rings is varied in such a way that electrons are collected radially in a potential
energy trough to an n+ anode at the center of the detector on the front side.
