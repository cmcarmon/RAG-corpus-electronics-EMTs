Although space waves suffer little ground attenuation, they nevertheless are susceptible to fading. 
This is because space waves actually follow two paths of different lengths (direct path and ground 
reflected path) to the receiving site and, therefore, may arrive in or out of phase. If these two component 
waves are received in phase, the result is a reinforced or stronger signal. Likewise, if they are received out 
of phase, they tend to cancel one another, which results in a weak or fading signal.
