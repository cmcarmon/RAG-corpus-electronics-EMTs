A dependent source will also complicate the node analysis previously described
when its element law does not easily relate its branch current to its branch
voltage. In this case, it will again not be possible to complete Step 3, and so it is
again necessary to modify the node analysis slightly. Since there are four types
of dependent sources, and the branch currents and voltages that control them
can appear through or across many different types of elements, it is impractical
to treat each case separately in its most efficient manner. As a compromise,
we present here a single method that treats all cases of dependent sources, and
illustrate how this method can be made more efficient in a few illustrative cases.
We will illustrate the method using the circuit in Figure 3.23, which contains a
dependent current source, whose current is some function of a branch variable
i as shown in the figure.
