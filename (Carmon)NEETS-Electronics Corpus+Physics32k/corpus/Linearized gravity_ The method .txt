In linearized gravity the metric tensor,



g


{\displaystyle g}
, of spacetime is treated as a sum of an exact solution of Einstein's equations (often Minkowski spacetime) and a perturbation



h


{\displaystyle h}
.




g

=
η
+
h


{\displaystyle g\,=\eta +h}

where



η


{\displaystyle \eta }
is the nondynamical background metric that is being perturbed about, and



h


{\displaystyle h}
represents the deviation of the true metric (



g


{\displaystyle g}
) from flat spacetime.
The perturbation is treated using the methods of perturbation theory, "linearized" by ignoring all terms of order higher than one (quadratic in



h


{\displaystyle h}
, cubic in



h


{\displaystyle h}
etc...) in the perturbation.
