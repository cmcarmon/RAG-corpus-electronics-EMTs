Plasma with a magnetic field strong enough to influence the motion of the charged particles is said to be magnetized. A common quantitative criterion is that a particle on average completes at least one gyration around the magnetic field before making a collision, i.e.,

{\displaystyle \omega _{\mathrm {ce} }/v_{\mathrm {coll} }>1}

{\displaystyle \omega _{\mathrm {ce} }}
is the "electron gyrofrequency" and

{\displaystyle v_{\mathrm {coll} }}
is the "electron collision rate". It is often the case that the electrons are magnetized while the ions are not. Magnetized plasmas are anisotropic, meaning that their properties in the direction parallel to the magnetic field are different from those perpendicular to it. While electric fields in plasmas are usually small due to the high conductivity, the electric field associated with a plasma moving in a magnetic field is given by

B



{\displaystyle \mathbf {E} =-v\times \mathbf {B} }
(where




E



{\displaystyle \mathbf {E} }
is the electric field,




v



{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} }
is the velocity, and




B



{\displaystyle \mathbf {B} }
is the magnetic field), and is not affected by Debye shielding.
