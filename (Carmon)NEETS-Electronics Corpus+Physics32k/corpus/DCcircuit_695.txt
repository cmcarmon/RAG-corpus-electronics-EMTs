A Ô¨Ånal, and ingenious, solution to the problem of voltmeter loading is that of the potentio-
metric or null-balance instrument. It requires no advanced (electronic) circuitry or sensitive
devices like transistors or vacuum tubes, but it does require greater technician involvement
and skill. In a potentiometric instrument, a precision adjustable voltage source is compared
against the measured voltage, and a sensitive device called a null detector is used to indi-
cate when the two voltages are equal. In some circuit designs, a precision potentiometer is
used to provide the adjustable voltage, hence the label potentiometric. When the voltages are
equal, there will be zero current drawn from the circuit under test, and thus the measured
voltage should be unaffected. It is easy to show how this works with our last example, the
high-resistance voltage divider circuit:
