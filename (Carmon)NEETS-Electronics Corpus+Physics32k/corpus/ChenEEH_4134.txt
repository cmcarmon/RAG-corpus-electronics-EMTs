The relationship between the premodulation ﬁlter band-
width B and the bit period T deﬁnes the bandwidth of the
system. If B > 1=T , then the waveform is essentially minimal
shift keying. When B < 1=T , the intersymbol
interference
occurs because the signal cannot react to its next position in
the symbol time. However, intersymbol interference can be
traded for bandwidth reduction if the system has sufﬁcient
