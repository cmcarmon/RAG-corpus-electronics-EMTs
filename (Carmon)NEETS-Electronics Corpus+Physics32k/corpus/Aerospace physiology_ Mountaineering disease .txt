One type of hypoxia related syndrome is mountaineering disease. A non-acclimated person that stays for a significant amount of time at a high altitude can develop high erythrocytes and hematocrit. Pulmonary arterial pressure will increase even if the person is acclimated, presenting dilatation of the right side of the heart. Peripheral arterial pressure is decreased, leading to congestive cardiac insufficiency, and death if exposure is long enough. These effects are produced by a decrease of erythrocytes, which causes a significant increase of viscosity in blood. This causes diminished blood flow in tissues, so oxygen distribution decreases. The vasoconstriction of the pulmonary arterioles is caused by hypoxia in the right portion of the heart. Arteriole spasms include the major part of the blood flow through the pulmonary vessels, producing a short circuit in the blood flow giving less oxygen in blood. The person will recover if there is an administration of oxygen or if s/he is taken to low altitudes.
Mountaineering disease and pulmonary edema are most common in those who climb rapidly to a high altitude.This illness starts from a few hours up to two or three days after ascension to a high altitude. There exist two cases: acute cerebral edema and acute pulmonary edema. The first one is caused by the vasodilatation of the cerebral blood vessels produced by the hypoxia; the second one is caused by the vasoconstriction of the pulmonary arterioles, caused by the hypoxia.
