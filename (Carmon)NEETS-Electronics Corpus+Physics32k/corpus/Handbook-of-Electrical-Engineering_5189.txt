Another domain of smart material application is in self-induced morphologies in the infrastructure of the
material with self-adaptive adjustments to the surroundings. Examples of this category include materials usable
over a wide range of temperatures (as in space shuttles), with a smart adaptibility to transform according to
the environment. Similarly, in radar stealth applications, the target skin could offer variable electromagnetic
absorption over a broad band of radar frequencies.
