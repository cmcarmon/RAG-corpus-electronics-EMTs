So what can we do? We know the voltage of the source (9 volts) applied across the series
combination of R1, R2, and R3, and we know the resistances of each resistor, but since those
quantities aren’t in the same context, we can’t use Ohm’s Law to determine the circuit current.
If only we knew what the total resistance was for the circuit: then we could calculate total
current with our ﬁgure for total voltage (I=E/R).
