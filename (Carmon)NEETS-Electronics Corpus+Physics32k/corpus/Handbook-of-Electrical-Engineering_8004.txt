All processors require an external clock, typically a crystal. The processor internal circuits run at this speed,
but external devices usually use a submultiple of this rate, the bus clock, which is usually 2 to 4 times slower.
The advertised clock rate is usually the external clock rate, not the bus cycle speed.
