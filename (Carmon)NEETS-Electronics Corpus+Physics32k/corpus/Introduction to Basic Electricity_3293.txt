If EGS is increased too much, the thin insulating 
layer ruptures, ruining the device. The insulating 
layer is so sensitive that it can be  damaged by a 
static charge that has built up on the leads of the 
device. Electrostatic charges on fingers can be 
transferred to the MOSFETâ€™s leads when handling 
or mounting the device.
