Note that to perform control ï¬‚ow checking, each block must
have three embedded signatures: the current block signature
and the signatures of the two possible blocks following the
branch instruction at the end of the block (see Figure 8.12).
These three signatures must be sent to the WD (via the buffer)
whenever fetched by the processor irrespective of their position
in the block and of the counter value.
