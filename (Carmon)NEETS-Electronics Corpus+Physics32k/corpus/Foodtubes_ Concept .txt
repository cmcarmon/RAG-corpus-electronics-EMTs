The concept for Foodtubes was initially developed by Noel Hodson, a professional project planner and project manager. Hodson chose pipelines as his method because pipelines are believed to be the most efficient minimum weight vehicles (MWVs), because there is little to no vehicle weight. MWVs succeed in keeping the vehicle's curb weight at the least possible value, where curb weight is the weight of a vehicle with all necessary operating equipment and fuel. The vehicle is defined as the container used to transport freight. Using pipeline capsules, most of the weight in the capsules would come from the freight itself, whereas in current systems using trucks, most of the weight comes from the vehicle.
