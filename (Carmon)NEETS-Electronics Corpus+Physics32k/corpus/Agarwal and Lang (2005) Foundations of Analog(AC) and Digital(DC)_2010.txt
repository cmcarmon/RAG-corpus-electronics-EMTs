1. Those of you taken aback by the sudden reappearance of Q (introduced in Section 12.4.1,
Equation 12.65) take heart from the fact that we will have a lot more to say about Q from a
frequency point of view in Section 14.2. For now,
it suffices to understand that for a high Q
resonant circuit the value of the damping factor Î± is small, and therefore the natural response of
the circuit will last for a long time.
