Polyethylene (PE) is perhaps one of the most common solid dielectrics, which is extensively used as a solid
dielectric extruded insulant in power and communication cables. Linear PE is classiﬁed as a low- (0.910–0.925),
medium- (0.926–0.940), or high- (0.941–0.965) density polymer (cf. Table 55.2). Since PE is essentially a long-
chain hydrocarbon material in which the repeat unit is –CH2–CH2–, a low-density PE necessarily implies a high
degree of branching. Decreased branching increases the crystallinity as molecules undergo internal folding, which
leads  to  improved  stiffness,  tear  strength,  hardness,  and  chemical  resistance.  Cross  linking  of  PE  produces  a
thermosetting polymer with a superior temperature rating, improved tensile strength, and an enhanced resistance
to partial discharges. Most of the PE used on extruded cables is of the cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) type.
Ethylene-propylene  rubber  (EPR)  is  an  amorphous  elastomer,  which  is  synthesized  from  ethylene  and
propylene. As an extrudent on cables its composition has ﬁller contents up to 50%, comprising primarily clay,
with smaller amounts of added silicate and carbon black. The dielectric losses are appreciably enhanced by the
ﬁllers,  and,  consequently,  EPR  is  not  suitable  for  extra-high-voltage  applications,  with  its  use  being  usually
conﬁned to lower and intermediate voltages (£138 kV) and also where high cable ﬂexibility due to its rubber
properties may be additionally desired.
