counter at the time of testing. The change of 
400 Hz is the information frequency change brought about by
the change in strain or temperature measured by the sensor. It is this information frequency change that the
discriminators isolate as a dc voltage change, which is proportional to the measured strain and is recorded on
the oscillograph.
