ODU's Climate Change and Sea Level Rise Initiative (CCSLRI) has facilitated research and education in all aspects of climate change and alleged resulting sea level rise. Because of Old Dominion's unique location there is special emphasis on adaptation to increased flooding because of sea level rise. There are many other aspects of climate change affecting coastal cities such as public health or disaster preparedness that the initiative also addressed.
