The typical trackball has an X and Y optical encoder that generates a pulse for each 0.76 mm of incremental
motion of the ball. This means that the pulse train may range from 10 to 2500 pulses per second (pps), depending
on how fast the ball is rotated. This is much more rapid than required for satisfactory updates, which need not
be greater than about 100 times per second. This can easily be accomodated by the RS-232 protocol using an
eight-bit  word.  Thus,  the  trackball  is  an  excellent  alternative  for  the  mouse,  and  is  rapidly  returning  to  a
preferred position as an input device.
