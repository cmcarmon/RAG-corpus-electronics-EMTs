On the left side is an impedance, and on the right side is the
sum of two impedances, indicating that the elements will be in
series L0
0. All three transform-
ations are summarized in Figure 4.20 for easy understanding.
As an example, we will take the third order maximally ﬂat ﬁlter
from Table 4.2 and its realization in Figure 4.21(A). We then
transform it into a band-pass ﬁlter with center frequency
v0 ¼ 1 rad/s and with the bandwidth D ¼ 0:1 rad/s. The
transformed band-pass ﬁlter is in Figure 4.21(B) and its amp-
litude response in Figure 4.22. Using equations from section
4.5, the band-pass ﬁlter can be transformed to any impedance
level and any center frequency with a bandwidth equal to one
tenth of the center frequency.
