Resistance has units of ohms, denoted by â„¦, named for the German electrical scientist Georg Ohm5. Some-
times, the v-i relation for the resistor is written i = Gv, with G, the conductance, equal to 1
R. Conductance
has units of Siemens (S), and is named for the German electronics industrialist Werner von Siemens6.
