If the electrolyte is spilled or splashed on the skin or eyes, IMMEDIATELY flush the skin or eyes 
with large quantities of fresh water for a minimum of 15 minutes. If the electrolyte is in the eyes, be sure 
the upper and lower eyelids are pulled out sufficiently to allow the fresh water to flush under the eyelids. 
The medical department should be notified as soon as possible and informed of the type of electrolyte and 
the location of the accident.
