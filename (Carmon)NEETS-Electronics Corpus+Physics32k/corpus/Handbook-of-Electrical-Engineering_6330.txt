Four  data  streams  are  asynchronously  multiplexed  to  form  the  information  to  be  transmitted  (G).  These
four  signals  consist  of  the  coded  differential  video,  the  motion  detector  parameters,  the  digital  audio  signal
(using Dolby Labsâ€™ AC-3 digital audio), and the synchronizing signals. Other information can be multiplexed,
including various control signals that may be needed by cable operators.
