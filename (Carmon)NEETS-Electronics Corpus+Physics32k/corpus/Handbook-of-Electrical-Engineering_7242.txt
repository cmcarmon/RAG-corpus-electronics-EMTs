Estimates of the cost to rewire range from $200 to $1000 per change. In fact, a survey by KPMG Peat Marwick2
quoted that the average relocation cost for just rewiring a LAN station averages $300 per node. But those are
just the direct costs; the time to effect the wired change is a signiﬁcant problem as well. Moves, for example,
often take weeks or longer to coordinate in addition to the time to actually make the physical wiring change.
Most of the research respondents were asked what proportion of their company’s staff was involved in some
kind of a move involving wiring or rewiring. The majority of the respondents, almost 80%, had some type of
relocation or addition of personnel over the last year surveyed. Their responses ranged from as few as 20% per
year up to as much as 200% annually. Furthermore, according to the KPMG Peat Marwick study, the average
company  moves  its  employees  approximately  50%  annually.  Telecommunications  consultant  Richard  Kuehn
states that data terminals are moved as often as 1.5 to 3 times per year. The combined problems of the actual
hard  relocation  costs,  however,  are  just  the  beginning.  Soft,  or  hidden,  costs  further  exacerbate  the  cabling
dilemma.
