A homeokinetic approach to complex systems has been applied to ecological psychology, anthropology, geology,  law, motor control, bioenergetics, and political science.
It has also been applied to social physics where a homeokinetics analysis shows that one must account for flow variables such as the flow of energy, of materials, of action, reproduction rate, and value-in-exchange.
