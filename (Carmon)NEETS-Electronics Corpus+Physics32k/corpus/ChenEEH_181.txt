Networks
always have
z12 ¼ z21. In addition, z11 and z22 will have the same poles
as z12 ¼ z21. Both z11 and z22 can have additional poles
(called private poles), as we will
the
network components are only L and C, then z11 and z22
must satisfy the conditions on LC impedances discussed pre-
viously.
