F I G U R E 4.44 Nonlinear resistor
voltage regulator. Parts (b) and (c)
show the DC and the incremental
subcircuits, respectively. The sub-
circuits are derived according to
the discussion preceding this
example. For more discussion of
DC and incremental subcircuits,
see Section 8.2.1 in Chapter 8.
