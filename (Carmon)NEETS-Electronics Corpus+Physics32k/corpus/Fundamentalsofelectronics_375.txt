Thus, the Fourier series for the half-wave rectiﬁed sinusoid has non-zero terms for its average,
fundamental, and even harmonics. The expression for the complex series coeﬃcients concisely
represents this structure. Because the signal is real-valued, conjugate symmetry applies to the
coeﬃcients; we need only specify ck for k ≥ 0.
