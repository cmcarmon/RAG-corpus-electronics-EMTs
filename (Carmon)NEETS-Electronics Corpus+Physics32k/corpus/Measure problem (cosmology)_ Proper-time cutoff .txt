The proper-time cutoff measure considers the probability



P
(
ϕ
,
t
)


{\displaystyle P(\phi ,t)}
of finding a given scalar field



ϕ


{\displaystyle \phi }
at a given proper time



t


{\displaystyle t}
. During inflation, the region around a point grows like




e

3
H
Δ
t




{\displaystyle e^{3H\Delta t}}
in a small proper-time interval



Δ
t


{\displaystyle \Delta t}
.
This measure has the advantage of being stationary in the sense that probabilities remain the same over time in the limit of large



t


{\displaystyle t}
. However, it suffers from the youngness paradox, which has the effect of making it exponentially more probable that we'd be in regions of high temperature, in conflict with what we observe.
