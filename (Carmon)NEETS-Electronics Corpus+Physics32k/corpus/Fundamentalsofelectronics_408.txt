calculations entirely in the frequency domain. Using Fourier series, we can calculate how any linear circuit
will respond to a periodic input.
4.8 Derivation of the Fourier Transform14
Fourier series clearly open the frequency domain as an interesting and useful way of determining how circuits
and systems respond to periodic input signals. Can we use similar techniques for non-periodic signals? What
is the response of the ﬁlter to a single pulse? Addressing these issues requires us to ﬁnd the Fourier spectrum
of all signals, both periodic and non-periodic ones. We need a deﬁnition for the Fourier spectrum of a signal,
periodic or not. This spectrum is calculated by what is known as the Fourier transform.
