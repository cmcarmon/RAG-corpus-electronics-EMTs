Gauss's theorem can be interpreted in terms of the lines of force of the field as follows:
The flow field through the surface is the number of field lines penetrating the surface. This takes into account the direction of – field lines penetrating the surface considered with a minus sign in the opposite direction. Force lines begin or end only on charges (start on the positive end to the negative), or may even go to infinity. The number of lines of force emanating from the charge (starting it) anyway, the magnitude of this charge (the charge is defined in the model). (For all the negative charges of the same, only the charge is equal to minus the number of its member (it ends) lines. On the basis of these two provisions of the Gauss theorem is evident in the statement: the number of lines emanating from a closed surface is equal to the total number of charges inside it – that is, the number of lines that appear within it. Of course, meant keeping signs, in particular, the line, which began within the surface on the positive charge can end on a negative charge and within it (if there is), then it does not give a contribution to the flux through this surface, as, or even before it not reach, or be released, and then enters back (or, in general, the surface intersects an even number of times equal to the forward and the opposite direction) that gives zero contribution to the flow in the summation with the correct sign..The same can be said about the lines begin and end outside the given surface – for the same reason, they also give a zero contribution to flow through it. .
