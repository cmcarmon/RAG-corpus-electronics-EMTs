Because the manifold pressure sensor is located upstream
from the idle valve actuator (after the throttle plate), it cannot
measure the pressure changes caused by the idle valve actuator.
Thus, a state observer is necessary. Moreover, since the torque
disturbance appears in the system state equations, it must also
be estimated to estimate the intake manifold pressure accu-
