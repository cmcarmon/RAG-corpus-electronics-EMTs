Low-frequency transmitting installations are characterized by their large physical size and by their 
high construction and maintenance costs. Another disadvantage is low-frequency signal reception being 
seriously hampered by atmospheric noise, particularly at low geographical latitudes. Over the years, 
propagation factors peculiar to the low-frequency band have resulted in their continued use for radio 
communications. Low-frequency waves are not so seriously affected during periods of ionospheric 
disturbance when communications at the high frequencies are disrupted. Because of this, the Navy has a 
particular interest in the application of low frequencies at northern latitudes.
