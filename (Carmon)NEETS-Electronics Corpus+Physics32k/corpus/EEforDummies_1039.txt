Preparing your parts and tools
Before you start randomly sticking things into your breadboard, you should 
make sure that you have everything you need. Check the parts list — the list 
of electronic ingredients you need to build your circuit — and set aside the 
components you need. Gather essential tools, such as needle‐nose pliers, 
wire cutters, and a wire stripper (see Figure 15-3).
