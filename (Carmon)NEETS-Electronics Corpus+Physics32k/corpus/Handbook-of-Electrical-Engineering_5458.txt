The  ﬁrst  commercial  high-voltage  direct-current  (HVDC)  power  transmission  system  was  commissioned  in
1954, with an interconnection between the island of Gotland and the Swedish mainland. It was an undersea
cable, 96 km long, with ratings of 100 kV and 20 MW. There are now more than 50 systems operating throughout
the  world,  and  several  more  are  in  the  planning,  design,  and  construction  stages.  HVDC  transmission  has
become acceptable as an economical and reliable method of power transmission and interconnection. It offers
advantages over alternating current (ac) for long-distance power transmission and as asynchronous intercon-
nection between two ac systems and offers the ability to precisely control the power ﬂow without inadvertent
loop ﬂows in an interconnected ac system. Table 61.4 lists the HVDC projects to date (1995), their ratings, year
commissioned  (or  the  expected  year  of  commissioning),  and  other  details.  The  largest  system  in  operation,
Itaipu HVDC transmission, consists of two –600-kV, 3150-MW-rated bipoles, transmitting a total of 6300 MW
power from the Itaipu generating station to the Ibiuna (formerly Sao Roque) converter station in southeastern
Brazil over a distance of 800 km.
