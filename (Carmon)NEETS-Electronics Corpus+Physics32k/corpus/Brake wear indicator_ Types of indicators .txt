There are different types of wear indicators for brake pads:
Ocular inspection: A cut is made in the pad material to the depth where it shall be replaced. Requires manual inspection of the pads.
Mechanical: A metal plate is designed to scratch the brake disk causing a noise when the pad has worn down to the desired level. Some cars, such as the 2004 Honda Civic, use a plate that has been tuned specifically to sound like fingernails on a chalkboard, in order to manipulate the owner into replacing the worn brake pads as soon as possible.
Electrical: A metal body is embedded in the pad material that comes in contact with the rotor when the desired wear level is reached. This will light an indicator in the instrument cluster.
Position sensor: A sensor that measures the position of the brake mechanics and indicates to the driver when the desired position has been achieved.
Of the alternatives above the first three are simple and cheap since their lifetime coincides with the service life of the brake pad. The last one is more expensive since the sensors needs to be designed to survive the designed service life of the vehicle. This means that the last alternative is usually only seen on heavy duty vehicles.
The idea is that in all cases alert the driver and/or owner of the vehicle that it is time to replace the brake pads to ensure that the traffic safety is preserved for the vehicle.
