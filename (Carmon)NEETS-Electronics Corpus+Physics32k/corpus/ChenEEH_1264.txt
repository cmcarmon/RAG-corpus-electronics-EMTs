Random-access memory (RAM) allows storage location to be
accessed in any order and access time to be ﬁxed regardless of
the accessed location. Unlike sequential access memory (e.g.,
magnetic tape), for which data access can only start from the
beginning and the address is searched sequentially, RAM can
access any address in a constant time. For example, if the access
time of a RAM is stated to be 60 ns, any address location inside
that RAM can be accessed within that time. RAM is, therefore,
much faster to read from and write to than other storage
devices such as hard disks, ﬂoppy disks, and magnetic tapes.
However, the stored information in RAM is volatile. RAM
loses all of its contents as soon as the power to the system is
turned off. There are two types of RAM: static (SRAM) and
dynamic (DRAM). It is worth noting that the terms static and
dynamic do not refer to mechanical movement in storage
device; instead, they refer to the need to refresh the contents.
In DRAM, the stored contents have a tendency to decay over-
time. Thus, periodic recharging (refreshing) is needed to
maintain the content correctness. SRAM, on the other hand,
does not require refreshing. A typical refresh rate is 15 ms.
