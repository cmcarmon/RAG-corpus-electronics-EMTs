This section analyzes circuits from a filter point of view. Let us begin with a
detailed analysis of a simple RC circuit with a view towards using it as a filter. To
illustrate the concept of filtering, let us find the voltage across the capacitor in the
simple RC circuit of Figure 13.31a, assuming that vi = Vi cos(ωt). In particular,
we wish to find the amplitude of the output signal as the frequency ω of the
input signal is changed.
