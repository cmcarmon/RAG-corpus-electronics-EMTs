The schematic symbols of the basic gates and the logic truth tables are shown in Ô¨Ågure 7.1.
The open circle is used to indicate the NOT or negation function and can be replaced
by an inverter in any circuit. A signal is negated if it passes through the circle. Any logic
operation can be formed from NAND or NOR gates or a combination of both. We also
commonly have gates with more than two inputs. Inverter gates can be formed by applying
the same logic signal to both inputs of an NOR or NAND gate.
