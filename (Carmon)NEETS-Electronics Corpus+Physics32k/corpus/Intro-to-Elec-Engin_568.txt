Magnetic tapes are ideal devices for storing vast quantities of information inexpensively.
However, the access time is slow because the entire tape must be read sequentially. The most
commonly used tapes are ½-in wide, 2400 or 3600 ft long, and contained in a long 10½-in reel.
Tape densities of 200, 556, 800, 1600, 6250, and 12,500 bits per inch (BPI) are standard.
