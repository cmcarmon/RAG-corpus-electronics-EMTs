In 1924, French physicist Louis de Broglie postulated that matter exhibits a wave-like nature given by:




λ
=


h
p


,


{\displaystyle \lambda ={\frac {h}{p}},}

where λ is the particle wavelength, h is Planck's constant, and p is the particle momentum. From this, it follows that interference effects between particles of matter will occur. This forms the basis of the Kapitza–Dirac effect. Specifically, Kapitza–Dirac scattering operates in the Raman–Nath regime. This is to say that the interaction time of the particle with the light field is sufficiently short in duration such that the motion of the particles with respect to the light field can be neglected. Mathematically, this means the kinetic energy term of the interaction Hamiltonian can be neglected. This approximation holds if the interaction time is less than the inverse of the recoil frequency of the particle,

. This is analogous to the thin lens approximation in optics. A coherent beam of particles incident on a standing wave of electromagnetic radiation (typically light) will be diffracted according to the equation:

{\displaystyle n\lambda =2d\sin \Theta ,}

where n is an integer, λ is the de Broglie wavelength of the incident particles, d is the spacing of the grating and θ is the angle of incidence. This matter wave diffraction is analogous to optical diffraction of light through a diffraction grating. Another incidence of this effect is the diffraction of ultra-cold (and therefore almost stationary) atoms by an optical lattice that is pulsed on for a very short duration. The application of an optical lattice transfers momentum from the photons creating the optical lattice onto the atoms. This momentum transfer is a two-photon process meaning that the atoms acquire momentum in multiples of 2ħk, where k is the wavevector of the electromagnetic The recoil frequency of the atom as can be expressed by:
