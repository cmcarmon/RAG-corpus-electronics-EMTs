Peripheral Readers
A  peripheral  reader  provides  a  communication  interface  between  a  larger  system  and  a  smart  card.  Using
standard interfaces, the reader is usually coupled to a control system that will send commands to the reader.
A peripheral reader can be integrated into a larger peripheral, such as payphones, a vending machine, or a card
personalization device.
