Nowadays, some European cars include some in-vehicle systems that supports driversâ€™ compliance with the speed limit, known as Intelligent Speed Adaptation (or ISA). ISA supports drivers in complying with the speed limit in various part of the network, while speed limiters for heavy good vehicles and coaches only limit the maximum speed. Those systems have positive effects on speed behaviour and imply large safety effects, while negative side effects are few documented. Speed-limiting device such as ISA are considered useful by 25% of European car drivers.
