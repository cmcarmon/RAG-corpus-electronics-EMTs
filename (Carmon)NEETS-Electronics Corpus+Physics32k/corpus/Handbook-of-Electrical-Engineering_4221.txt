Radar Performance Prediction
Radar Line-of-Sight
With the exception of over-the-horizon (OTH) radar systems, which exploit either sky-wave bounce or ground-
wave  propagation  modes  and  sporadic  ducting  effects  at  higher  frequencies,  surface  and  airborne  platform
radar  operation  is  limited  to  the  refraction-constrained  line  of  sight.  Atmospheric  refraction  effects  can  be
closely approximated by setting the earthâ€™s radius to 4/3 its nominal value in estimating horizon-limited range.
The  resulting  line-of-sight  range  is  depicted  in  Fig. 41.3  for  a  surface-based  radar,  an  airborne  surveillance
radar, and a space-based radar.
