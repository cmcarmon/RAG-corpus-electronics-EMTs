Reflection is complete when an rf line is terminated in a short circuit, but the effect on voltage and
current differs from the effect obtained in an open-ended line. Voltage is reflected in opposite phase,
while current is reflected in phase. Again look at the series of diagrams in figure 3-27. The left column
represents current, and the right column shows voltage changes on the shorted line. The standard
representation of standing waves on a shorted line is shown in figure 3-30; the voltage is a solid line, and
