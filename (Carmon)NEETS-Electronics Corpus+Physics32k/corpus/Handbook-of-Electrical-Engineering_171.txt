Under  short-circuit  conditions  the  fuse  operates  and  fully  opens  the  circuit  in  less  than  0.01  s.  At  50  or
60 Hz, this represents operation within the Ô¨Årst half cycle. The current waveform let-through by the fuse is the
shaded, almost triangular, portion shown in Fig. 1.34(a). This depicts a fraction of the current that would have
been let through into the circuit had a fuse not been installed.
