Commercial or passenger aircraft are usually designed for optimum performance at their cruise speed or VC. Combustion engines have an optimum efficiency level for fuel consumption and power output. Generally, piston engines are most efficient between idle speed and 25% short of full throttle.
With aircraft, other factors affecting optimum cruise altitude include payload, center of gravity, air temperature, humidity, and speed. This altitude is usually where the higher ground speeds, the increase in aerodynamic drag power, and the decrease in engine thrust and efficiency at higher altitudes are balanced.
Typical cruising airspeed -for a long-distance commercial passenger aircraft- is approximately 475 – 500 knots (878 – 926 km/h; 546 – 575 mph).
