The basic principles just developed apply equally well to the atoms of more complex elements. In
atoms containing two or more electrons, the electrons interact with each other and the exact path of any
one electron is very difficult to predict. However, each electron lies in a specific energy band and the
orbits will be considered as an average of the electronâ€™s position.
