Hot electrons transfer energy into thermal vibrations of the
crystal lattice. Such vibrations can be modeled as harmonic
oscillations with a certain frequency, vl. The energy levels of a
harmonic oscillator are equidistant with the energy difference
between the levels equal to El ¼ hvl. Hence, the scattering
process for a hot electron can be represented as follows. The
electron accelerates in the electric ﬁeld until it gains enough
energy to excite lattice vibrations:
