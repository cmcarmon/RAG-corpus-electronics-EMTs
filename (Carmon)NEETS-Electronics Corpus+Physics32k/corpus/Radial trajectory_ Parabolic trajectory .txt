{\displaystyle t(x)={\sqrt {\frac {2x^{3}}{9\mu }}}}

where t is the time from or until the time at which the two masses, if they were point masses, would coincide, and x is the separation.
This equation applies only to radial parabolic trajectories, for general parabolic trajectories see Barker's equation.
