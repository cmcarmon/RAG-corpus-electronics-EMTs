circuits. These units can be of the step-down or step-up
conÔ¨Åguration. A step-down is designed to decrease the incom-
ing voltage to a lower level more suitable for distribution.
Power transformers of this type are frequently located in sub-
stations or at large industrial consumer locations. Transform-
ers that perform this reduction in voltage from a primary
feeder to the utilization level are referred to as distribution
transformers. A step-up transformer takes the input voltage
and raises it to a higher lever suitable for transmission. Ameri-
can National Standards Institute (ANSI) standards require the
nameplate to indicate the transformer is suitable for this type
of operation. A generator step-up transformer is an example of
this type of power transformer. The majority of these type
power transformers are three-phase units.
