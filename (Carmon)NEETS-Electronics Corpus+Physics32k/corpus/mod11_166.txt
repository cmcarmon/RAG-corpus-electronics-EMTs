The output of a magnetron is reduced by the bombardment of the filament by electrons which travel 
in loops, shown in figure 2-22, views (B) and (C). This action causes an increase of filament temperature 
under conditions of a strong magnetic field and high plate voltage and sometimes results in unstable 
operation of the tube. The effects of filament bombardment can be reduced by operating the filament at a 
reduced voltage. In some cases, the plate voltage and field strength are also reduced to prevent destructive 
filament bombardment.
