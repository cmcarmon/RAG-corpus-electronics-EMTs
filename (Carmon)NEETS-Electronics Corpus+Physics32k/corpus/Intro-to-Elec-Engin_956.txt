11.5.1 A one-line diagram of a three-phase distribution
system is given in Figure P11.5.1. Determine
the line-to-line voltage at the sending end of the
high-voltage feeder when the transformer deliv-
ers rated load at 240 V (line-to-line) and 0.8
lagging power factor. Neglect the exciting current
of the transformer.
