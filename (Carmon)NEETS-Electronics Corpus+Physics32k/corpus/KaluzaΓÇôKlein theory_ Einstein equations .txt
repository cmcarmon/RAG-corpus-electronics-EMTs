The equations governing ordinary gravity in free space can be obtained from an action, by applying the variational principle to a certain action. Let M be a (pseudo-)Riemannian manifold, which may be taken as the spacetime of general relativity. If g is the metric on this manifold, one defines the action S(g) as




S

g
)

∫

{\displaystyle S(g)=\int _{M}R(g)\mathrm {vol} (g)\,}

where R(g) is the scalar curvature and vol(g) is the volume element. By applying the variational principle to the action

{\displaystyle {\frac {\delta S(g)}{\delta g}}=0}

one obtains precisely the Einstein equations for free space:
