Inserting a low reluctance material in front of the 
magnetic field can bend flux lines. Low-reluctance 
materials are called magnetic	shields. An example 
is the material called Mu-metal. The magnetic shield 
is placed around the item to be protected. Electronic 
equipment, especially oscilloscopes, requires shielding 
from magnetic flux lines.
