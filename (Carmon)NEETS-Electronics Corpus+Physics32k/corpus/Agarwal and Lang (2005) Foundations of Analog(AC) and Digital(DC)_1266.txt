Figure 9.17 shows the possible capacitor combinations that use up to three capacitors. To
determine their equivalent capacitances, use the series combination result from Equation
9.39 and/or the parallel combination result from Equation 9.42. This yields the equivalent
capacitances of: (A) 1 µF, (B) 2 µF, (C) 0.5 µF, (D) 3 µF, (E) 1.5 µF, (F) 0.667 µF, and
(G) 0.333 µF.
