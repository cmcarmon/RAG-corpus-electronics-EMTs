In pure sinusoidal modeling applications, the concept of forward and backward prediction is often used.
The data matrix arising from a forward-backward modeling will then have a block Toeplitz-Hankel structure.
This in turn gives rise to the signal restoration task of Ô¨Ånding a matrix of block Toeplitz-Hankel structure
that most closely approximates a given matrix. The results of Theorem 10 can be trivially extended to treat
this case.
