This tuning system, like others, is based on the old-fashioned radio tuning principle, in which one brackets
a resonance by manual back-and-forth actuation of a tuning device while seeking an optimum quantitative
or qualitative measure of the signal. In both traditional manual tuning and in other automated resonance-
tracking systems, the tuning adjustments usually vary the frequencies, but in this case, one does not have
the option of frequency tuning because the frequency of oscillation of the magnetron is not adjustable and
is nominally constant.
