Object-Oriented Programming
In languages that support object-oriented programming, classes (i.e., types) of objects are deÔ¨Åned by specifying
(1) the variables that each object will own as instance variables and (2) operations, called methods, applicable
to the objects of the class. As a difference in style, these methods are not invoked like functions or procedures,
but are sent to an object as a message. The expression [window moveTo : x : y] is an example of a message in
the programming language Objective C, a dialect of C. Here the object window, which may represent a window
on the screen, is instructed to apply to itself the method moveTo using the parameters x and y.
