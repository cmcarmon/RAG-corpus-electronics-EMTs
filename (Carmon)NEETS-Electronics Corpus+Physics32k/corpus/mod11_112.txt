The resonator potential also causes the resonant cavity to begin oscillating at its natural frequency 
when the tube is energized. These oscillations cause an electrostatic field across the grid gap of the cavity 
that changes direction at the frequency of the cavity. The changing electrostatic field affects the electrons 
in the beam as they pass through the grid gap. Some are accelerated and some are decelerated, depending 
upon the polarity of the electrostatic field as they pass through the gap. Figure 2-10, view (A), illustrates 
the three possible ways an electron can be affected as it passes through the gap (velocity increasing, 
decreasing, or remaining constant). Since the resonant cavity is oscillating, the grid potential is an 
alternating voltage that causes the electrostatic field between the grids to follow a sine-wave curve as 
shown in figure 2-10, view (B). As a result, the velocity of the electrons passing through the gap is 
affected uniformly as a function of that sine wave. The amount of velocity change is dependent on the 
strength and polarity of the grid voltage.
