according  to  the  voltage,  at  any  instant,  of  the 
modulating  signal.  In  the  latter  case,  the  carrier 
frequency is varied in accordance with the voltage, 
at any instant, of the modulating signal. 
  Figure  13.7  shows  the  effect  of  amplitude  and 
frequency modulating a sinusoidal carrier (note that 
the  modulating  signal 
this  case,  also 
sinusoidal).  In  practice,  many  more  cycles  of  the 
RF  carrier  would  occur  in  the  time-span  of  one 
cycle of the modulating signal.
