Some metals are better conductors of electricity than others. Silver, copper, gold, and aluminum are
materials with many free electrons and make good conductors. Silver is the best conductor, followed by
copper, gold, and aluminum. Copper is used more often than silver because of cost. Aluminum is used
where weight is a major consideration, such as in high-tension power lines, with long spans between
supports. Gold is used where oxidation or corrosion is a consideration and a good conductivity is
