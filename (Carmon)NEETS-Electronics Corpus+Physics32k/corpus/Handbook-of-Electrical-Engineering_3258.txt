Most  lasers  deliver  a  beam  that  contains  only  a  narrow  range  of  wavelengths,  and  thus  the  beam  can  be
considered monochromatic for all practical purposes. Conventional light sources, in contrast, emit light over
much of the visible and infrared spectrum. For most applications, the range of wavelengths emitted by lasers
is narrow enough to make life easier for designers by avoiding the need for achromatic optics and simplifying
the task of understanding the interactions between laser beam and target. For some applications in spectroscopy
and  communications,  however,  that  range  of  wavelengths  is  not  narrow  enough,  and  special  line-narrowing
options may be required.
