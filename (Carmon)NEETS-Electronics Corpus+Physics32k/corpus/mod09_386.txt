Now that all the components and voltages have been described for the stable state, let us see how the 
circuit operates (see figure 3-13). Assume that a negative pulse is applied at the input terminal. C2 
couples this voltage change to the base of Q1 and starts Q1 conducting. Q1 quickly saturates, and its 
collector voltage immediately rises to ground potential. This sharp voltage increase is coupled through C1 
to the base of Q2, causing Q2 to cut off; the collector voltage of Q2 immediately drops to VCC. The 
voltage divider formed by R5 and R3 then holds the base of Q1 negative, and Q1 is locked in saturation.
