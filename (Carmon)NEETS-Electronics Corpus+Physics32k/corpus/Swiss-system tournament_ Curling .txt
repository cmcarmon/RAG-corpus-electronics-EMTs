Curling uses a variation called the Schenkel system.
Like a Swiss tournament, the Schenkel ensures that after the first round teams will play against teams with similar levels of success so far. That means that after the first round the pairs for the second round would be first-ranked team against the second, third against fourth, and so on.
In a true Swiss-style tournament all teams play in one group. However, in a curling arena there are a limited number of curling sheets available at any one time. Therefore, the teams are usually divided into groups, and the groups are rearranged after a round or two.
The criteria used for ranking are, in order:
points won (2 points for victory in a game, 1 point for a tie, none for a loss)
total ends won so far
total stone-points scored
stone ratio (stone-points scored minus stone-points conceded)
