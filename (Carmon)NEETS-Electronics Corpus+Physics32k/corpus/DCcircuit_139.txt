For American automobiles, engine power is rated in a unit called ”horsepower,” invented
initially as a way for steam engine manufacturers to quantify the working ability of their
machines in terms of the most common power source of their day: horses. One horsepower is
deﬁned in British units as 550 ft-lbs of work per second of time. The power of a car’s engine
won’t indicate how tall of a hill it can climb or how much weight it can tow, but it will indicate
how fast it can climb a speciﬁc hill or tow a speciﬁc weight.
