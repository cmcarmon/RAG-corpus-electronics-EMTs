The team has established a baseline design concept that serves as a common conÔ¨Åguration for inves-
tigations. A full-scale craft of this design would have a maximum cruise speed of Mach 2.4, only marginally
faster  than  the Anglo-French  Concorde  supersonic  transport.  However,  the  HSCT  would  have  double
the capacity of the Concorde, and it would operate at an affordable ticket price.
