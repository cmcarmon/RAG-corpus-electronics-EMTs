The most widely used electromechanical device is a rotating machine, which utilizes the magnetic
Ô¨Åeld to store energy. The main purpose of most rotating machines is to convert electromechanical
energy, i.e., to convert energy between electrical and mechanical systems, either for electric power
generation (as in generators or sources) or for the production of mechanical power to perform
useful tasks (as in motors or sinks). Rotating machines range in size and capacity from small motors
that consume only a fraction of a watt to large generators that produce several hundred megawatts.
In spite of the wide variety of types, sizes, and methods of construction, all such machines operate
on the same principle, namely, the tendency of two magnets to align themselves.
