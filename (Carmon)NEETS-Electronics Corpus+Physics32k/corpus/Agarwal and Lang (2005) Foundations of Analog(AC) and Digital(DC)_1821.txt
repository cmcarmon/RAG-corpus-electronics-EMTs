First, we replace each capacitor by an independent voltage source having
a voltage equal to the corresponding capacitor state. Additionally, we replace
each inductor by an independent current source having a current equal to the
corresponding inductor state. Second, we analyze the new circuit, which now
contains only sources and resistors, to find the capacitor currents and inductor
voltages. This analysis may be carried out using the node method developed
in Chapter 3. It results in expressions that depend on the independent sources
within the new circuit, namely the original independent sources and the sources
representing the circuit states. Finally, we substitute the expressions for the
capacitor currents and inductor voltages into equations of the form of Equations
12.249 and 12.250. This yields the desired state equations.
