The price of a new vehicle with a manual transmission tends to be lower than the same vehicle with an automatic transmission.
Most new vehicles are available with manual or automatic transmissions. There is often a difference in cost between the two. Manual transmissions generally cost less than automatic transmissions. For example, the base price of a Chevrolet Cruze 2LT with a manual transmission is $22,120, while the base price of the automatic is $23,405â€”a difference of $1,285.
