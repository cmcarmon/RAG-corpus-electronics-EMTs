If you have a complicated circuit design or just want to understand more 
about how a particular circuit will behave when powered up, you can use 
a circuit simulator. This software program uses computer‐based models of 
circuit components to predict the behavior of real circuits. You tell it what 
components and power supplies you’re using and how they should be wired, 
and the software tells you whatever you want to know about the operation of 
the circuit: the current through any component, voltage drops across compo­
nents, circuit response across various frequencies, and so forth.
