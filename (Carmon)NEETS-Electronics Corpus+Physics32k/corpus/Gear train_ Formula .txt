The teeth on gears are designed so the gears can roll on each other smoothly (without slipping or jamming). In order for two gears to roll on each other smoothly, they must be designed so the velocity at the point of contact of the two pitch circles (represented by v) is the same for each gear.
Mathematically, if the input gear GA has the radius rA and angular velocity




ω

A





{\displaystyle \omega _{A}\!}
, and meshes with output gear GB of radius rB and angular velocity




ω

B





{\displaystyle \omega _{B}\!}
, then:




v

{\displaystyle v=r_{A}\omega _{A}=r_{B}\omega _{B},\!}

The number of teeth on a gear is proportional to the radius of its pitch circle, which means the ratios of the gears' angular velocities, radii, and number of teeth are equal. Where NA is the number of teeth on the input gear and NB is the number of teeth on the output gear, the following equation is formed:

{\displaystyle {\frac {\omega _{A}}{\omega _{B}}}={\frac {r_{B}}{r_{A}}}={\frac {N_{B}}{N_{A}}}.}

This shows that a simple gear train with two gears has the gear ratio R given by:

{\displaystyle R={\frac {\omega _{A}}{\omega _{B}}}={\frac {N_{B}}{N_{A}}}.}

This equation shows that if the number of teeth on the output gear GB is larger than the number of teeth on the input gear GA, then the input gear GA must rotate faster than the output gear GB.
