First order LTI systems are characterized by the differential equation

{\displaystyle {\tau }{dV \over dt}+V=f(t)}

where τ represents the exponential decay constant and V is a function of time t

{\displaystyle V=V(t).}

The right-hand side is the forcing function f(t) describing an external driving function of time, which can be regarded as the system input, to which V(t) is the response, or system output. Classical examples for f(t) are:

where A is the amplitude of the forcing function, f is the frequency in Hertz, and ω = 2π f is the frequency in radians per second.
