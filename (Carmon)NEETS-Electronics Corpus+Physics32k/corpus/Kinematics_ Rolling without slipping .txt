An object that rolls against a surface without slipping obeys the condition that the velocity of its center of mass is equal to the cross product of its angular velocity with a vector from the point of contact to the center of mass:






v


G


(
t
)
=

Ω

×


r


G

/

O


.


{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {v}}_{G}(t)={\boldsymbol {\Omega }}\times {\boldsymbol {r}}_{G/O}.}

For the case of an object that does not tip or turn, this reduces to



v
=
r
ω


{\displaystyle v=r\omega }
.
