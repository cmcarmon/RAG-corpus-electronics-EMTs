There are three major speech-related conferences each year, namely, International Conference on Acoustics, Speech
and Signal Processing (ICASSP), International Conference on Spoken Language Processing (ICSLP), and European
Conference on Speech Communication and Technology (EUROSPEECH). Besides this, Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency (DARPA) conducts workshops on Broadcast News Transcription (transcription of live television
broadcasts)  and  Switchboard  (conversations  between  individuals  over  the  telephone)  tasks.  Also,  there  are
several conferences addressing speciÔ¨Åc issues such as phonetic sciences, robust methods for speech recognition
in adverse conditions, etc. Journals related to speech include IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing,
IEEE  Transactions  on  Signal  Processing,  Computer  and  Speech  Language,  Speech  Communications  and  IEEE
Transactions on Information Theory. Additional details on the statistical techniques used in speech recognition
can be found in several books [23, 25, 32]. A good review of current techniques can also be found in [6].
