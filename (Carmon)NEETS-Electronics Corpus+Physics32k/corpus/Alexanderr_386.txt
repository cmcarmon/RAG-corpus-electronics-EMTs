The  gasoline  engine  of  an  automobile  requires  that  the  fuel-air
mixture  in  each  cylinder  be  ignited  at  proper  times.  This  is  achieved
by  means  of  a  spark  plug  (Fig.  7.78),  which  essentially  consists  of  a
pair of electrodes separated by an air gap. By creating a large voltage
(thousands  of  volts)  between  the  electrodes,  a  spark  is  formed  across
the  air  gap,  thereby  igniting  the  fuel.  But  how  can  such  a  large  volt-
age be obtained from the car battery, which supplies only 12 V? This
is achieved by means of an inductor (the spark coil) L. Since the volt-
age across the inductor is 
large by cre-

switch in Fig. 7.78 is closed, the current through the inductor increases

Again, the time taken for the inductor to charge is ﬁve times the time
