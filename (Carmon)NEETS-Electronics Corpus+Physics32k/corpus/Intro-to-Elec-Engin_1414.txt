Generally speaking, in most of the communication systems the transmitting and receiving
antennas (reciprocal elements) face each other directly such that their large main lobes point
toward each other, and the received-power output will be maximum. When scaled such that
the maximum intensity is unity, the radiation-intensity pattern is commonly called the radiation
pattern. In many problems in practice, the radiation pattern occurs with one dominant main
lobe, and as such, instead of considering the full three-dimensional picture, the behavior may
adequately and conveniently be described in two orthogonal planes containing the maximum of
the main lobe. These are known as principal-plane patterns in terms of angles θ and φ. Figure
15.1.9 illustrates one such pattern in polar and linear angle plots as a function of θ. The angular
separation between points on the radiation pattern that are 3 dB down from the maximum is called
