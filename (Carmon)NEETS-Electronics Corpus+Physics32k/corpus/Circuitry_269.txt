where  RID is  the  change  in  drain  current  resulting 
from a corresponding change in gate-source voltage 
(RVGS).  The  units  of  forward  transfer  conductance 
are Siemens (S). 
  Forward  transfer  conductance  (gfs) varies  with 
drain  current  collector  current.  For  most  small 
signal  devices,  gfs  is  quoted  for  values  of  drain 
current between 1mA and 10 mA.  Itâ€™s also worth 
noting  that  most  FET  parameters  (particularly 
forward  transfer  conductance)  are  liable  to  wide 
variation  from  one  device  to  the  next.  It  is, 
therefore, important to design circuits on the basis 
of  the  minimum  value  for  gfs  in  order  to  ensure
