13.2.16 The synchronous speed of a wound-rotor induc-
tion motor is 900 r/min. Under a blocked-rotor
condition, the input power to the motor is 45 kW
at 193.6 A. The stator resistance per phase is 0.2
, and the ratio of effective stator turns to effec-
tive rotor turns is 2. The stator and rotor are both
wye-connected. Neglect the effect of the core-
loss and magnetizing impedances. Calculate:
(a) The value in ohms of the rotor resistance per
