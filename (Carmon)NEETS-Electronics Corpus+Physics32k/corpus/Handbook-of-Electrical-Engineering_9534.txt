If a transaction fails for whatever reason after (partially committed) or (active) while updating the database,
it  may  be  necessary  to  bring  the  database  to  its  previous  (original)  state  by  undoing  the  transaction.  This
operation is called roll-back. A roll-back operation requires some information about the changes made on the
data items during a transaction. Such information is usually kept outside the database in a system log. Generally,
roll-back operations are part of the techniques used to recover from transaction failures.
Database Security
A  database  needs  to  be  protected  against  unauthorized  access.  It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  DBA  to  create
account numbers and passwords for legitimate users. The DBA can also specify the type of privileges a particular
account has. In relational databases, this includes the privilege to create base relations, create views, alter relations
by adding or dropping a column, and delete relations. The DBA can also revoke privileges that were granted
previously. In SQL, the command GRANT is used to grant privileges and the REVOKE command to revoke
privileges that have been granted.
