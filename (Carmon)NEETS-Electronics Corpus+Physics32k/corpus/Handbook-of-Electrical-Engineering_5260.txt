The head is produced by building a dam across a river, which forms the upper-level reservoir. In the case of
low  head,  the  water  forming  the  reservoir  is  fed  to  the  turbine  through  the  intake  channel  or  the  turbine  is
tubes or tunnels are used
integrated in the dam. The latter arrangement is shown in Fig. 59.11(A). 
for  medium-  [Fig.  59.11(B)]  and  high-head  plants  (Fig.  59.12).  The  spillway  regulates  the  excess  water  by
opening gates at the bottom of the dam or permitting overﬂow on the spillway section of the dam. The water
discharged from the turbine ﬂows to the lower or tail water reservoir, which is usually a continuation of the
original water channel.
