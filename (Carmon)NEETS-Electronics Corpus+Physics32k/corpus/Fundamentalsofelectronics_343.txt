Solution to Exercise 3.15 (p. 61)
To ﬁnd the equivalent resistance, we need to ﬁnd the current ﬂowing through the voltage source. This current
equals the current we have just found plus the current ﬂowing through the other vertical 1 Ω resistor. This
current equals e1
vin.
1
Thus, the equivalent resistance is 13
11

Not necessarily, especially if we desire individual knobs for adjusting the gain and the cutoﬀ frequency.
