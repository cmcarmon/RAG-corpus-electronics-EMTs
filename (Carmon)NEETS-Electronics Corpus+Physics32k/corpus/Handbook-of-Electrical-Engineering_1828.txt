where each function on the right-hand side is a univariate function of the respective independent variable, if
and only if s(x,t) in Eq. (17.3) is also product separable. In beamforming, Si(ki) in Eq. (17.6) would be the far-
Ô¨Åeld beam pattern of a linear array along the xi-axis. For example, the normalized beam pattern of a uniformly
weighted (shaded) linear array of length L is
