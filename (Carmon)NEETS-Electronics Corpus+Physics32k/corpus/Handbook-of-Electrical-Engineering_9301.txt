Programming methodology is concerned with the problem of producing and managing large software projects.
It relates to programming as the theory of style relates to writing prose. Abiding by its rules does not, in itself,
guarantee success, but ignoring them usually creates chaos. Many useful books have been written on the subject
and there is a wealth of primary literature. Some of these books, that themselves contain numerous pointers
to the primary literature, are listed at the end of this section.
