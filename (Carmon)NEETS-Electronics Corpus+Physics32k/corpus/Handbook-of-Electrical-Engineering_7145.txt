The degradation to a digital link from interference follows a form similar to that of Eq. (74.16) in terms of
eb /no where the lower case quantities refer to numerical ratios. For a link that is subject to a given additive white
noise-like interference power expressed as a ratio of desired signal power to interference power, c/i, and assuming
digital modulation with m bits per symbol,
