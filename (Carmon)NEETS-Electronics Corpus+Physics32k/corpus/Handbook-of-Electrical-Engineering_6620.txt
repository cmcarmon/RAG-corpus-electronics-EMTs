Since the mid-1980s the idea of the 
 (ISDN) has become reality. In ISDN
voice services with supplementary features and data services with a bit rate of up to 64 kbit/s are integrated in
one  network.  For  voice  communication  and  many  text  and  data  applications  the  64-kbit/s  ISDN  will  be

sufÔ¨Åcient. Although it is minor as yet, there exists already a growing demand for 
with bit rates from some megabits per second up to approximately 130 Mbit/s [Wiest, 1990] (e.g., high-speed
data communication, video communication, high-resolution graphics).
