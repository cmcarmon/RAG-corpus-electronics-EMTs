Full-wave rectifiers 
 
Unfortunately,  the  half-wave  rectifier  circuit  is 
relatively inefficient as conduction takes place only 
on  alternate  half-cycles.  A  better 
rectifier 
arrangement would make use of both positive and 
negative  half-cycles.  These  full-wave  rectifier 
circuits  offer  a  considerable  improvement  over 
their  half-wave  counterparts.  They  are  not  only 
more efficient but are significantly less demanding 
in 
smoothing 
components.  There  are  two  basic  forms  of  full-
wave  rectifier;  the  bi-phase  type  and  the  bridge 
rectifier type.
