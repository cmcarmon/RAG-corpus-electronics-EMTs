Photovoltaics
PV refers to the direct conversion of insolation (incident solar radiation) to electricity. A PV cell (also known
 junction diode with the junction positioned very close
as a solar cell) is simply a large-area semiconductor 
to the top surface. Typically, a metallic grid structure on the top and a sheet structure in the bottom collect
the minority carriers crossing the junction and serve as terminals. The minority carriers are generated by the
incident photons with energies greater than or equal to the energy gap of the semiconductor material.
