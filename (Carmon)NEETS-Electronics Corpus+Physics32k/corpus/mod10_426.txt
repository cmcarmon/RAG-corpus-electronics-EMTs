The installation of a complete waveguide transmission system is somewhat more difficult than the
installation of other types of transmission lines. The radius of bends in the waveguide must measure
greater than two wavelengths at the operating frequency of the equipment to avoid excessive attenuation.
The cross section must remain uniform around the bend. These requirements hamper installation in
confined spaces. If the waveguide is dented, or if solder is permitted to run inside the joints, the
attenuation of the line is greatly increased. Dents and obstructions in the waveguide also reduce its
breakdown voltage, thus limiting the waveguideâ€™s power-handling capability because of possible arc over.
Great care must be exercised during installation; one or two carelessly made joints can seriously inhibit
the advantage of using the waveguide.
