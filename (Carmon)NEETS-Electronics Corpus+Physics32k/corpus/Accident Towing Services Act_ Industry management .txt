Part 3 of the Accident Towing Services Act makes provision for an accreditation scheme for management participants in the accident towing industry. A person must not conduct an accident towing service business or be the manager of an accident towing depot unless the person holds an accredtitation issued by VicRoads. Part 3 contains provisions relating to the mechanics of these schemes including VicRoads' powers to issue accreditation. The Part also contains a scheme which seeks to regulate character requirements as part of the accreditation process particularly through the specification of a range of criminal offences which, if they form part of an applicant's background, can result in mandatory or discretionary refusal of accreditation by VicRoads. The Part also enables VicRoads to attach conditions to an accreditation. In addition, the Part confers power on the Minister to set service standards to be met by holders of accreditation. The standards may cover matters such as complaints handling and the provision of information to VicRoads relating to complaints.
The Part also contains power for VicRoads to take disciplinary action against an accredited person if VicRoads is satisfied that the person has contravened the Act, committed a listed offence, contravened a condition of a tow truck licence or an accreditation or if the action is appropriate having regard to the objective of accreditation. The disciplinary action that may be taken by VicRoads includes suspension or cancellation of accreditation, a direction that the person must undergo training or at the giving of a warning.
The Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal is given power by the Act to review decisions made by VicRoads under Part 3 including in relation to refusal of accreditation and cancellation.
