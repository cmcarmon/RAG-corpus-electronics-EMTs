trip (overreaching/underreaching): The
transfer trip solution offers higher security than de-
pendability. A failure to receive the channel signal
results in a failure to trip for internal faults. The trans-
fer trip systems require extra logic for internal-trip
operation at a local terminal when the remote terminal
breaker is open or for a ‘‘weak infeed’’ when the fault
contribution is too low to send a trip signal. This is not
a problem with blocking and unblocking systems.
