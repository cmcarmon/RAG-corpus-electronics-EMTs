The word magnet is derived from magnetite, the 
name of a mineral found in Magnesia, a part of Asia 
Minor. This mineral is a natural magnet. Another 
type of magnet is the artificial	magnet. This mag-
net is created by rubbing a piece of soft iron with a 
piece of magnetite. A third type of magnet is the 
 electromagnet created by current flowing through 
a coil of wire.
