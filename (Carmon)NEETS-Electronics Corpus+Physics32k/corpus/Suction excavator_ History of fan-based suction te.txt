The RSP GmbH have been making suction excavators and stationary suction units since 1993. Since 2000, RSP developed a new suction principle, the ESE Series. These vehicles work with the internationally patented suction principle which guarantees the highest degree of gravity separation, lowest contamination of the filters and thus consistently high suction performance.
Since 1998, the MTS Mobile Tiefbau Saugsysteme GmbH is making another type of suction excavator. It is said to have a new designed air flow principle, and thus a considerably improved suction performance.
(Gully emptiers and the old type of suction street cleaner vehicle that could only pick up loose debris have been around for much longer.)
