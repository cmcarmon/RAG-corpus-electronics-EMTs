high-level synthesis techniques. Of course, a designer can
also overcome noise by using new materials in interconnect,
including Ô¨Åber optics or electromagnetic transmission and
three-dimensional interconnects that use multiple levels of
active devices. New packaging methodologies can also be
used to reduce noise (Sematech, 2001).
