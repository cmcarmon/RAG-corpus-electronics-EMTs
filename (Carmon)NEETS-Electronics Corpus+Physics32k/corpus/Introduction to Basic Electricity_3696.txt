The output voltage can be adjusted accurately by 
varying potentiometer R4. To increase the output 
voltage of the regulator, the wiper of potentiometer 
R4 is moved in the more negative direction. This de-
creases the sample voltage on the base of transistor Q2, 
 decreasing the forward bias. This results in transistor 
Q2 conducting less, causing the collector voltage of 
transistor Q2 and the base of transistor Q1 to increase. 
This increases the forward bias on transistor Q1, caus-
ing it to conduct more. More current flows through 
the load, which increases the voltage out.
