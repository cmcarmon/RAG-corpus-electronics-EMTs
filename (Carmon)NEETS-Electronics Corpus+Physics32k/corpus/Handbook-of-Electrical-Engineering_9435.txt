Perhaps the simplest form of a code is the parity code. The basic concept of parity is very straightforward,
but there are variations on the fundamental idea. Single-bit parity codes require the addition of an extra bit to
a binary word such that the resulting code word has either an even number of 1s or an odd number of 1s. If
odd parity.
the extra bit results in the total number of 1s in the code word being odd, the code is referred to as 
If the resulting number of 1s in the code word is even, the code is called 
If a code word with odd
parity experiences a change in one of its bits, the parity will become even. Likewise, if a code word with even
parity  encounters  a  single-bit  change,  the  parity  will  become  odd.  Consequently,  a  single-bit  error  can  be
detected by checking the number of ls in the code words. The single-bit parity code (either odd or even) has
a distance of 2, therefore allowing any single-bit error to be detected but not corrected. Figure 93.4 illustrates
the use of parity coding in a simple memory application.
