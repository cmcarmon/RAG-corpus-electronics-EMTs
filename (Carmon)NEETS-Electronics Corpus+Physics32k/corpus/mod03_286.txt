An electrical unit is built with great care to ensure that each separate electrical circuit is fully
insulated from all the others. This is done so that the current in a circuit will follow its intended path.
Once the unit is placed into service, however, many things can happen to alter the original circuitry. Some
of the changes can cause serious problems if they are not detected and corrected. While circuit protection
devices cannot correct an abnormal current condition, they can indicate that an abnormal condition exists
and protect personnel and circuits from that condition. In this chapter, you will learn what circuit
conditions require protection devices and the types of protection devices used.
