An ohmmeter (which contains its own batteries) is excellent for use in a continuity test. Normally,
continuity tests are performed in circuits where the resistance is very low, such as the resistance of a
copper conductor. An open is indicated in these circuits by a very high or infinite resistance between two
continuously connected points.
