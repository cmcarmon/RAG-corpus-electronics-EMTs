Here  f  denotes  the  distribution  function  (number  of  electrons  per  unit  volume  of  the  phase  space,  i.e., f  =
dn/d 3rd 3p), v is electron velocity, p is momentum, and (¶f /¶t)coll is the “collision integral” describing the change
of f caused by collision processes described earlier. For the purpose of semiconductor modeling, Eq. (22.10)
can be solved directly using various numerical techniques, including the method of moments (hydrodynamic
modeling) or Monte Carlo approach. The drift-diffusion equation (22.9) follows from (22.10) as a special case.
For  even  shorter  devices  quantum  effects  become  important  and  device  modeling  may  involve  quantum
transport theory [Ferry, 1991].
