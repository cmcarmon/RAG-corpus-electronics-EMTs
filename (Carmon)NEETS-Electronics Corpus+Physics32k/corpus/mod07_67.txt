The universe, as we know it today, is divided into two parts: matter and energy. Matter, which is our
main concern at this time, is anything that occupies space and has weight. Rocks, water, air, automobiles,
clothing, and even our own bodies are good examples of matter. From this, we can conclude that matter
may be found in any one of three states: SOLIDS, LIQUIDS, and GASES. All matter is composed of
either an element or combination of elements. As you know, an element is a substance that cannot be
reduced to a simpler form by chemical means. Examples of elements with which you are in contact
everyday are iron, gold, silver, copper, and oxygen. At present, there are over 100 known elements of
which all matter is composed.
