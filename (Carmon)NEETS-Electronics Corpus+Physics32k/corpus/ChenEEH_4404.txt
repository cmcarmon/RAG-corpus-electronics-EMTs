of the system that gives the maximum gain of the system to
a vector of sinusoids in the worst possible direction and
worst possible frequency. If G(s) is proper and stable, then
kGk1 ¼ sup
ss{G(jv)} is ﬁnite. Another popular measure of
a system is the H2 norm. One interpretation of the H2 norm is
as the gain from a white noise input with unit variance to the
power of the output. The power is deﬁned as:
