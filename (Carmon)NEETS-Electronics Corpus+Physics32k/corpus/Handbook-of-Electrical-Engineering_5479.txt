Noncharacteristic Harmonics.
In addition to the harmonics described above, converters also generate other
harmonics  due  to  “nonideal”  conditions  of  converter  operation.  Examples  of  the  nonideal  conditions  are
converter  ac  bus  voltage  imbalance,  perturbation  of  valve  ﬁring  pulses,  distortion  of  ac  bus  voltages,  and
unbalanced converter transformer impedances. Harmonics generated due to these causes are called nonchar-
acteristic  harmonics.  These  are  usually  smaller  in  magnitude  compared  to  characteristic  harmonics  but  can
create problems if resonances exist in the ac system at these frequencies. In several instances additional ﬁlters
were installed at the converter ac bus to reduce levels of these harmonics ﬂowing into the ac system.
