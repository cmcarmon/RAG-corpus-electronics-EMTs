Notice that we obtain a voltage gain greater than unity if gmRL > 1. Thus, the circuit in
Figure 7.6 behaves as an amplifier for properly chosen values of RL. In other words, the
circuit produces an amplified version of vI at its output vO. Section 7.4 will introduce
a physical device that behaves as a voltage-controlled current source and develops an
amplifier based on that device.
iO versus iI Next, let us determine iO versus iI. Substituting vI = iIRI and vO = iORL
in Equation 7.1, we can write
