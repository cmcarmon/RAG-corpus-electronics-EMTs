The mobility term used in the previous equations differs from
the bulk mobility due to additional scattering mechanisms
associated with the surface, including interface charge scatter-
ing, coulombic scattering, and surface roughness scattering.
These mechanisms tend to lower the carrier mobility in the
channel. These mechanisms also tend to exhibit a dependence
on the vertical electric ﬁeld, Ey. At low ﬁelds, interface and
coulombic scattering are the dominant mechanisms. At high
ﬁelds, the surface roughness scattering dominates. Since the
vertical ﬁeld varies along the channel, mobility also varies. The
dependence on the vertical ﬁeld is generally expressed as:
