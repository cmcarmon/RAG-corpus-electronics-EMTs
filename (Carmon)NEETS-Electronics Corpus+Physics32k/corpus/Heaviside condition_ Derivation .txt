The transmission function of a transmission line is defined in terms of its input and output voltages when correctly terminated (that is, with no reflections) as







V


i
n




V


o
u
t





=

e

γ
x




{\displaystyle {\frac {V_{\mathrm {in} }}{V_{\mathrm {out} }}}=e^{\gamma x}}

where



x


{\displaystyle x}
represents distance from the transmitter in meters and




γ
=
α
+
j
β



{\displaystyle \gamma =\alpha +j\beta \,}

are the secondary line constants, α being the attenuation in nepers per metre and β being the phase change constant in radians per metre. For no distortion, α is required to be independent of the angular frequency ω, while β must be proportional to ω. This requirement for proportionality to frequency is due to the relationship between the velocity, v, and phase constant, β being given by,




v
=


ω
β




{\displaystyle v={\frac {\omega }{\beta }}}

and the requirement that phase velocity, v, be constant at all frequencies.
The relationship between the primary and secondary line constants is given by

{\displaystyle \gamma ^{2}=(\alpha +j\beta )^{2}=(R+j\omega L)(G+j\omega C)\,}

which has to be of the form




(
A

)

{\displaystyle \scriptstyle (A+j\omega B)^{2}}
in order to meet the distortionless condition. The only way this can be so is if




(

{\displaystyle \scriptstyle (R+j\omega L)}
and




(
G
+
j
ω
C
)



{\displaystyle \scriptstyle (G+j\omega C)}
differ by no more than a real constant factor. Since both have a real and imaginary part, the real and imaginary parts must independently be related by the same factor, so that;

{\displaystyle {\frac {R}{G}}={\frac {j\omega L}{j\omega C}}}

and the Heaviside condition is proved.
