Sometimes, only a single weight and cable is used. Such an arrangement is colloquially named a "yo-weight." When the final stage is a solid rocket, the stage may continue to thrust slightly even after spacecraft release. This is from residual fuel and insulation in the motor casing, outgassing even without significant combustion. In a few cases, the spent stage has rammed the payload. By using one weight without a matching counterpart, the stage eventually tumbles. The tumbling motion prevents residual thrust from accumulating in a single direction; instead, the stage's exhaust averages out to a much lower value over a wide range of directions.
In March 2009, a left-over yo weight caused a scare when it came too close to the International Space Station.
