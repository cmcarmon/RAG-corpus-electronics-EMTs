In reservation TDMA, on the other hand, voice call requests are serviced by the assignment (reservation) of
a logical channel for inbound voice trafﬁc. Although various means are implemented to avoid collisions on the
satellite link, the time needed to reserve capacity on an inbound carrier may be lengthy, depending on trafﬁc
conditions. Therefore, call setup times are not as predictable as they are with the poll/response access scheme.
The VSAT  design  is  ideally  suited  for  digital  compressed  voice.  Coding  rates  of  32,  16,  and  9.6  kbps  and
lower can presently be achieved, depending on the compression technique employed. There are two classes of
digitizing voice signals: waveform coding and vocoding. In waveform coding, the analog voice curve is coded
and then reproduced by modeling its physical shape. Data rates are relatively high, i.e., higher than 9.6 kbps.
Vocoding attempts to reproduce the analog voice curve by abstractly “identifying” the type and shape of the
curve. Only a set of parameters is transmitted, describing the nature of the curve. Achieved data rates can be
as low as 1.2 kbps.
