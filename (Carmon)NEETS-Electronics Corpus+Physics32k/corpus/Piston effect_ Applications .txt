The piston effect has to be considered by building designers in relation to smoke movement within an elevator shaft. A moving elevator car forces the air in front of it out of the shaft and pulls air into the shaft behind it with the effect most apparent in elevator systems with a fast moving car in a single shaft. This means that in a fire a moving elevator may push smoke into lower floors.
The piston effect is used in tunnel ventilation. In railway tunnels, the train pushes out the air in front of it toward the closest ventilation shaft in front, and sucks air into the tunnel from the closest ventilation shaft behind it. The piston effect can also assist ventilation in road vehicle tunnels.
In underground rapid transit systems, the piston effect contributes to ventilation and in some cases provides enough air movement to make mechanical ventilation unnecessary. At wider stations with multiple tracks, air quality remains the same and can even improve when mechanical ventilation is disabled. At narrow platforms with a single tunnel, however, air quality worsens when relying on the piston effect alone for ventilation. This still allows for potential energy savings by taking advantage of the piston effect rather than mechanical ventilation where possible.
