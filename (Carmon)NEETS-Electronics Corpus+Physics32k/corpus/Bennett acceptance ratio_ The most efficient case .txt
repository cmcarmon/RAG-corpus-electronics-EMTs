Bennett explores which specific expression for ΔF is the most efficient, in the sense of yielding the smallest standard error for a given simulation time. He shows that the optimal choice is to take




f
(
x
)
≡


1

1
+

e

x







{\displaystyle f(x)\equiv {\frac {1}{1+e^{x}}}}
, which is essentially the Fermi–Dirac distribution (satisfying indeed the detailed balance condition).




C
≈
Δ
F


{\displaystyle C\approx \Delta F}
. This value, of course, is not known (it is exactly what one is trying to compute), but it can be approximately chosen in a self-consistent manner.
Some assumptions needed for the efficiency are the following:
The densities of the two super states (in their common configuration space) should have a large overlap. Otherwise, a chain of super states between A and B may be needed, such that the overlap of each two consecutive super states is adequate.
The sample size should be large. In particular, as successive states are correlated, the simulation time should be much larger than the correlation time.
The cost of simulating both ensembles should be approximately equal - and then, in fact, the system is sampled roughly equally in both super states. Otherwise, the optimal expression for C is modified, and the sampling should devote equal times (rather than equal number of time steps) to the two ensembles.
