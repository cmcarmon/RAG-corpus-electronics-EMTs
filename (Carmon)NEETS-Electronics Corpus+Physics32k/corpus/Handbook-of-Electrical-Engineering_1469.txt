The basic acoustic unit modeled by the HMM can be either a word or a subword unit. For small recognition
vocabularies,  the  lexicon  typically  consists  of  whole-word  models  similar  to  the  model  shown  in  Fig. 15.18.
The number of states in such a model can either be ﬁxed or be made to depend on word duration. For larger
vocabularies,  words  are  more  often  deﬁned  in  the  lexicon  as  concatenations  of  phone  or  triphone  models.
Triphones are phone models with left and right context speciﬁed [Lee, 1988]; they are used to model acoustic
variability which results from the coarticulation of adjacent speech sounds.
