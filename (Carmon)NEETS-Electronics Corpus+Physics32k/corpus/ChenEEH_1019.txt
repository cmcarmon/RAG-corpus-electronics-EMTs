For certain logic styles, however, RSSA or glitching can be an
important source of signal activity. Glitching refers to spuri-
ous and unwanted transitions that occur before a node settles
down to its Ô¨Ånal steady-state value that occurs due to partially
resolved functions. Glitching often arises when paths with
unbalanced propagation delays converge at the same point in
the circuit. Because glitching can cause a node to make several
