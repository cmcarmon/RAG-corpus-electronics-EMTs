Note that this is considerably larger than the gain for a common-mode input signal; that is, the difference
stage ampliﬁes difference signals well but largely rejects common-mode signals. This common-mode rejection
property is very useful, for often, small signals appear across leads, both of which may contain identical electrical
noise.  So,  the  difference  stage  tends  to  reject  the  noise  while  still  amplifying  the  signal.  Furthermore,  the
difference stage has the advantage that it needs no coupling or bypass capacitors and so will amplify frequencies
down to zero (dc). Also, it is very stable biaswise and lends itself perfectly to realization on a monolithic IC.
To make the above derivation valid, the long-tail resistance RX should be as large as possible so that most of
the signal current enters the emitter of  Q2. However, RX must also carry the quiescent current, which would
produce a very high quiescent voltage drop and so require a very high value of VC C – . To overcome this, another
transistor structure may be used within a conﬁguration known as a current mirror.
