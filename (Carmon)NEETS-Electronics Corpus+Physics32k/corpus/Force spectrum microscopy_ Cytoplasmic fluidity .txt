Directed oscillation of tracer particles using optical tweezers resulted in displacement that was nearly synchronized with applied force, suggesting that the cytoplasm is materially closer to an elastic solid. This is in stark contrast to previous hypothesis that the cytoplasm is a viscoelastic fluid in which large molecules can freely diffuse. Interestingly, in ATP-depleted cells, in which non-muscle myosin II are inactivated, FSM experiments reveal that tracer particles cease to oscillate as if the cytoplasm had solidified. Myosin IIs are motor proteins that bind and tugs on actin filaments through ATP hydrolysis. This further corroborates the finding that in nutrient-starved bacteria, the cytoplasm transitions into a glasslike substance. Thus, ATP-hydrolysis by motor proteins appear to be critical to sustain cytoplasmic fluidity, which is crucial to vessicle transport and diffusive motion in the cytoskeleton.
