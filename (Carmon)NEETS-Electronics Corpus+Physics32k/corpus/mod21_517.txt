TIME-DOMAIN REFLECTOMETRY is a testing and measurement technique that has found 
increasing usefulness in testing transmission lines (both metallic and fiber-optic), cables, strip lines, 
connectors, and other wideband systems or components. Basically, time-domain reflectometry is an 
extension of an earlier technique in which reflections from an electrical pulse were monitored to locate 
faults and to determine the characteristics of power transmission lines. You can compare time-domain 
reflectometry to a closed-loop radar system in which the transmitted signal, a very fast step pulse, is fed 
into the system and the reflections resulting from discontinuities or impedance deviations in the system 
are monitored on a crt.
