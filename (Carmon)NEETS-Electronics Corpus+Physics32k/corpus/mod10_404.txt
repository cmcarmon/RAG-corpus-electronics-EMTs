All transmission lines have two ends (see figure 3-1). The end of a two-wire transmission line
connected to a source is ordinarily called the INPUT END or the GENERATOR END. Other names
given to this end are TRANSMITTER END, SENDING END, and SOURCE. The other end of the line is
called the OUTPUT END or RECEIVING END. Other names given to the output end are LOAD END
and SINK.
