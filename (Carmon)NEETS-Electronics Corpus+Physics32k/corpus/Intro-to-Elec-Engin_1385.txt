Signal multipath occurs with electromagnetic wave propagation via sky wave in the HF
range. When the transmitted signal reaches the receiver through multiple propagation paths with
different delays, signal fading may result. Both atmospheric noise and thermal noise become the
additive noise at high frequencies. It is possible to have ionospheric scatter propagation in the
frequency range of 30 to 60 MHz, and tropospheric scattering in the range of 40 to 300 MHz; but
relatively large antennas are needed with a large amount of transmitted power, because of large
signal propagation losses.
