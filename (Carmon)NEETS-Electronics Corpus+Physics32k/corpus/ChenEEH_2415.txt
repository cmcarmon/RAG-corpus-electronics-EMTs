Figure 6.7(A) shows the noise-equivalent circuit model of an
antenna. Like an ohmic resistance, the input resistance of the
antenna, Rin is associated with a noise source vna, with equiva-
lent noise temperature Tea (Pozar, 1998). Unlike an ohmic
resistance, however, Tea is not the physical temperature of the
antenna. The vna consists of two parts, vnL and vnr , with noise
temperatures, Ta and Ter , respectively associated with the loss
resistance Rloss and radiation resistance Rrad of the antenna.
The vnL is generated due to the thermal process in the antenna
itself, and therefore Ta is equal to the physical temperature of
