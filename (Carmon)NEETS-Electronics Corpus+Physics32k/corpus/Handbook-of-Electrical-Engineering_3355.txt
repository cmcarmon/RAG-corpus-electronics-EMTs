Light  modulation  is  realized  via  the  electro-optic  effect,  i.e.,  inducing  a  small  change  in  the  waveguide
refractive index by applying an electric ﬁeld within the waveguide. On an atomic scale the applied electric ﬁeld
causes slight changes in the basic crystal unit cell dimensions, which changes the crystal’s refractive index. The
magnitude of this change depends on the orientation of the applied electric ﬁeld and the optical polarization.
As a result, only certain crystallographic orientations are useful for device fabrication and devices are typically
polarization dependent. The electro-optic coefﬁcients of LiNbO3 are among the highest (30.8 pm/V) of any
inorganic material, making the material very attractive for integrated optic applications.
