Our method of applying node analysis to a circuit containing dependent
sources begins by assuming that we know the value of each dependent source.
This assumption allows us to treat each dependent source as an independent
source, and carry out a node analysis of the circuit as described in the previ-
ous subsections. For example, in the case of a dependent current source (see
Figure 3.23), we replace the dependent source with an independent current
source with some assumed current, say I (see Figure 3.24), and carry out our
usual five-step node analysis. As part of this analysis we solve for the branch
variables that control the dependent sources in terms of the assumed source
values.
