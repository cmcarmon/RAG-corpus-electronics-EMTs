Disadvantages of Individual Phase Control.  With distorted ac bus voltages, the ﬁring pulses will be unequally
spaced, thus generating noncharacteristic harmonics in ac current. This in turn will further distort the ac bus
voltage. This process could lead to harmonic instability, particularly with ac systems of low short-circuit capacity
(high-impedance  system).  Control  system  ﬁlters  were  tried  to  solve  this  problem.  However,  the  ﬁlters  could
increase the potential for commutation failures and also reduce the speed of control system response for faults
or disturbances in the ac system.
