molecule dispersed in an inert binder, or simply a good charge-transporting polymer (e.g., polyvinylcarbazole).
Since most polymer transport materials are essentially hole-transport materials, this requires that the PC surface
charge produced in Step 1 be negative. The CTL must be transparent at the imaging wavelength.
