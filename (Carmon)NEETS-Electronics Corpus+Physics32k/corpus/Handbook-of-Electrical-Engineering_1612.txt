It will be useful to present brieﬂy this bound.
The Rao-Cramèr bound gives a theoretical minimum for the variance of any estimate. More speciﬁcally, let
(xn) be  the  estimate  of  a  scalar  parameter  q  given  the  observation  vector  xn.  Let  f (x n*q)  be  given,  twice
q^
continuously differentiable with respect to q, and satisfy also some other mild regularity conditions. Then,
