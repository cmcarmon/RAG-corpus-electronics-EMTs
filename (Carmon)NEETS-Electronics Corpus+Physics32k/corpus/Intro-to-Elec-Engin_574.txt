a. For the binary input 100, switches controlled by B0, ¯B1, and ¯B2 will be closed. A path
is then produced between the output Vo and point 4, where the voltage is equal to Vref/2.
The analog output voltage is therefore Vref /2.
b. For the binary input 010, switches controlled by ¯B0, B1, and ¯B2 will be closed. A path
exists between Vo and point 6, where the voltage is equal to Vref /4. The analog output
voltage is thus Vref /4.
