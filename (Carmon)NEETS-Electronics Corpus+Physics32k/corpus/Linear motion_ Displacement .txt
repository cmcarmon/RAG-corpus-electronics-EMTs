The motion in which all the particles of a body move through the same distance in the same time is called translatory motion. There are two types of translatory motions: rectilinear motion; curvilinear motion. Since linear motion is a motion in a single dimension, the distance traveled by an object in particular direction is the same as displacement. The SI unit of displacement is the metre. If





x

1




{\displaystyle \,x_{1}}
is the initial position of an object and





x

2




{\displaystyle \,x_{2}}
is the final position, then mathematically the displacement is given by:




Δ
x
=

x

2


−

x

1




{\displaystyle \Delta x=x_{2}-x_{1}}

The equivalent of displacement in rotational motion is the angular displacement



θ


{\displaystyle \theta }
measured in radian. The displacement of an object cannot be greater than the distance because it is also a distance but the shortest one. Consider a person travelling to work daily. Overall displacement when he returns home is zero, since the person ends up back where he started, but the distance travelled is clearly not zero.
