A newer control ﬂow technique is the extended structural
integrity
(Mahmood and McCluskey,
1988), which extends the checking capabilities of SIC to
check run-time computed procedure calls and interrupt
handlers. The nodes of the CFG are encoded by successive
numbers, and the reference information is extracted in the
form of a stored reference signature database in which the
valid successors of each signature are given in a sparse matrix
format. The ﬁrst and last nodes of a procedure are tagged by
special ﬂags, SOP start of procedure (SOP) and end of proced-
ure (EOP). If an SOP signature is received (procedure call),
