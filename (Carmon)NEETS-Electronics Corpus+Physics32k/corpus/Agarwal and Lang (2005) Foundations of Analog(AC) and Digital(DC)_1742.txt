The preceding discussion suggests yet another interpretation for Q. From
Equation 12.77 it is apparent that the energy stored in the circuit during an
−2αt. From Equations 12.73 and 12.77
oscillation cycle is approximately wT(0)e
−2αt/C
it is also apparent that the average value of v 2
during that same cycle. Therefore the energy dissipated in the resistor during
−2αt/RCωd. Division of the stored energy
the cycle is approximately 2πwT(0)e
by the dissipated energy leads to the conclusion that
