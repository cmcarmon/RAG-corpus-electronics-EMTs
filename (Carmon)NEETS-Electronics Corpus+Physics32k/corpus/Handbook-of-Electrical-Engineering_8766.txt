Vendors and Assemblers follow the same blueprints; thus the 
resulting parts are guaranteed to ﬁt together.
Design interacts with production. Prototypes are made and 
discarded. Production workers are asked to give suggestions for 
improvement or on how to reduce costs.
Changes in implementation rarely affect the design as interfaces 
are separated from implementation. Thus, the materials may 
change, but not the need for the parts themselves.
New cars are evolutionary improvement to existing base 
technology, plus specializations that improve over last year’s 
model.
