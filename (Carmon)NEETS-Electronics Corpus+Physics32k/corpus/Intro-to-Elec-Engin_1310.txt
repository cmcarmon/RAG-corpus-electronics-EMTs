so that the equalized output signal is then z(t ) = Kx(t − td ), i.e., undistorted, regardless of the
distortion in y(t). For example, for correcting electrical and acoustical frequency distortion, audio
equalizers in high-ﬁdelity systems are used to adjust the amplitude ratio over several frequency
bands. Sometimes, as in audio systems, phase equalization is not that critical since the human
ear is not that sensitive to delay distortion. However, human vision is quite sensitive to delay
distortion. Equalizers are also applied whenever energy storage in a transducer, or some other
part of a signal-processing system, causes linear distortion.
