Although the brain consists of about 10l4 neurons, the EEG reï¬‚ects the electrical activity of the outer layer,
the  cortex,  which  is  the  seat  of  consciousness.  The  type  of  electrical  activity  depends  on  the  location  of  the
electrodes and the level of alertness. The frequency and amplitude are profoundly affected by alertness, drows-
iness,  sleep,  hyperventilation,  anesthesia,  the  presence  of  a  tumor,  head  injury,  and  epilepsy.  The  clinical
correlation between cerebral disorders and the voltage and frequency spectra is well ahead of the physiological
explanations for the waveforms.
