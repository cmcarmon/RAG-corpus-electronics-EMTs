In atomic physics, the Land√© interval rule states that if the spin-orbit interactions of an electron are weak, the energy levels of each (i.e. the spin and orbit) are split. Subsequently, each have a different angular momentum. The rule states that as a result of this, the frequency interval between successive energy levels is proportional to the larger of their total angular momentum values (J).
