Here k bits (one input frame) are shifted in each time, and concurrently n bits (the output frame) are shifted
out, where n > k. Thus, every k-bit input frame produces an n-bit output frame. Redundancy is provided in
the output, since n > k. Also, there is memory in the coder, since the output frame depends on the previous
K input frames where K > 1. The code rate is R = k/n, which is 3/4 in this illustration. The constraint length,
K,  is  the  number  of  input  frames  that  are  held  in  the  kK  bit  shift  register.  Depending  on  the  particular
convolutional code that is to be generated, data from the kK stages of the shift register are added (modulo 2)
and used to set the bits in the n-stage output register.
