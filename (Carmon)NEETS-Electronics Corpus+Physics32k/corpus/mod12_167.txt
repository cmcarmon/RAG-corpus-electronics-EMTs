If the signal to be transmitted contains voice frequencies only, and fidelity is of minor importance, 
the bandwidth requirement is much smaller. A baritone voice includes frequencies of approximately 100 
to 350 hertz, or 250 hertz. Intelligible voice communications can be carried out as long as the 
communications system retains audio frequencies up to several thousand hertz. Comparing the conditions
