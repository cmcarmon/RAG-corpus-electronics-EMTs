Costs to rewire rise enormously with the age and complexity of the building. The majority of high-rise ofﬁce
space  in  large  metropolitan  areas  presents  major  problems  and  expense  for  tenants  trying  to  install,  add,  or
move  network  wiring.  Buildings  more  than  30  or  40  year  old,  with  designs  and  construction  that  did  not
consider today’s electronic ofﬁce, poorly accommodate communications wiring. If asbestos insulation exists in
the  building,  as  it  does  even  in  many  pre–health-safety  regulated  buildings,  rewiring  costs  can  take  on  huge
proportions.
