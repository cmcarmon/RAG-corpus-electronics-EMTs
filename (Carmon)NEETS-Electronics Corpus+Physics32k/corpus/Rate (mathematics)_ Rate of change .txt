Consider the case where the numerator



f


{\displaystyle f}
of a rate is a function



f
(
a
)


{\displaystyle f(a)}
where



a


{\displaystyle a}
happens to be the denominator of the rate



δ
f

/

δ
a


{\displaystyle \delta f/\delta a}
. A rate of change of



f


{\displaystyle f}
with respect to



a


{\displaystyle a}
(where



a


{\displaystyle a}
is incremented by



h


{\displaystyle h}
) can be formally defined in two ways:










Average rate of change





=



f
(
a
+
h
)
−
f
(
a
)

h








Instantaneous rate of change





=

lim

h
→
0





f
(
a
+
h
)
−
f
(
a
)

h








{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\mbox{Average rate of change}}&={\frac {f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}}\\{\mbox{Instantaneous rate of change}}&=\lim _{h\to 0}{\frac {f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}}\end{aligned}}}

where f(x) is the function with respect to x over the interval from a to a+h. An instantaneous rate of change is equivalent to a derivative.
An example to contrast the differences between the unit rates are average and instantaneous definitions: the speed of a car can be calculated:
An average rate can be calculated using the total distance travelled between a and b, divided by the travel time
An instantaneous rate can be determined by viewing a speedometer.
However these two formulas do not directly apply where either the range or the domain of



f
(
)


{\displaystyle f()}
is a set of integers or where there is no given formula (function) for finding the numerator of the ratio from its denominator.
