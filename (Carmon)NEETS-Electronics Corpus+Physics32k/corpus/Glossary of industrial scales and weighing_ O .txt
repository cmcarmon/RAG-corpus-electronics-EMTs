Office of Weights and Measures (OWM)
A government office that partnered with the National Conference on Weights and Measures (NCWM) to promote uniformity in weights-and-measures laws, regulations, metrology tests and standards, in order to achieve equity between buyers and sellers. It was a division of the US Coast and Geodetic Survey, until it separated to become today's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
ohm

The unit of electrical resistance, measured as the resistance through which a current of one ampere will flow when a voltage of one volt is applied.

Ohm's law

The relationship between current, voltage and resistance. Current varies directly with voltage, and inversely with resistance (I = E/R, where I = Current, E = Voltage and R = Resistance).

original equipment manufacturer (OEM)

A manufacturer who produces equipment that another manufacturer can use or include in its product.

output
The signal (voltage, current, pressure, etc.) produced by a load cell. Where the output is directly proportional to excitation, the signal must be expressed in terms such as Volts per Volt, Millivolts per Volt, or Volts per Ampere, etc., of excitation.
output, rated
The algebraic difference between the outputs at no-load and at rated load.
overload rating, safe
The maximum load which can be applied without producing a permanent shift in performance characteristics (beyond those specified), expressed in percent of rated capacity.
overload rating, ultimate
The maximum load which can be applied without producing a structural failure, expressed in percent of rated capacity.
