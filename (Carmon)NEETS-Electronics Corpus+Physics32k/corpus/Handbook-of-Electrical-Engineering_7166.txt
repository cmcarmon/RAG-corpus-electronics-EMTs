The  satellite antennas  typically  are  offset-fed  paraboloids.  Typical  sizes  are  constrained  by  launch  vehicles
and have ranged from less than 1 m to more than 5 m for some applications. The INTELSAT VI satellite used
a 3.2 m antenna at 4 GHz. Ku-band satellites may use a diameter D > 2 m (i.e., D > 80 l). Multiple feeds in
the focal region each produce a narrow  component beam whose beamwidth is »65l/D and whose directions
are established by the displacement of the feeds from the focal point. These beams are combined to produce a
shaped  beam  with  relatively  high  gain  over  a  geographical  region.  Multiple  beams  are  also  used  to  reuse
frequencies on the satellite. Figure 74.2 suggests that a satellite may have several beams for frequency reuse. In
that case, the carriers occupying the same frequencies must be isolated from each other by either polarization
orthogonality or antenna sidelobe suppression. As long as the sidelobes of one beam do not radiate strongly
in the direction of another, both may use the same frequency band to increase the satellite’s capacity.
