Deviation in frequency is usually expressed in kilohertz. It is equal to the difference between the 
carrier frequency and either the highest or lowest frequency reached by the carrier in its excursions with 
modulation. There is no modulation percentage in the usual sense. With suitable circuit design, the 
frequency deviation may be made as large as desired without encountering any adverse effects that are 
equivalent to the overmodulation in amplitude-modulation transmissions. However, the maximum 
permissible frequency deviation is determined by the width of the band assigned for station operation.
