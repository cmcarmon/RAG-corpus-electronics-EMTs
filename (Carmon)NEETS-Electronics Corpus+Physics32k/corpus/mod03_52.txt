As you recall, the current in a dc circuit with 6 volts across a 6-ohm resistor is 1 ampere. The
@(UPPERCASE A) in figure 1-1 is the symbol for an ammeter. An ammeter is a device that measures
current. The name "ammeter" comes from the fact that it is a meter used to measure current (in amperes),
and thus is called an AMpere METER, or AMMETER. The ammeter in figure 1-1 is measuring a current
of 1 ampere with the voltage and resistance values given.
