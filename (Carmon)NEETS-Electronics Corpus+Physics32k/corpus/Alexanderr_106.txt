As  mentioned,  the  types  of  meters  we  have  discussed  are  known
as  analog meters  and  are  based  on  the  d’Arsonval  meter  movement.
Another type of meter, called a digital meter, is based on active circuit
elements such as op amps. For example, a digital multimeter displays
measurements  of  dc  or  ac  voltage,  current,  and  resistance  as  discrete
numbers, instead of using a pointer deﬂection on a continuous scale as
in an analog multimeter. Digital meters are what you would most likely
use  in  a  modern  lab.  However,  the  design  of  digital  meters  is  beyond
the scope of this book.
