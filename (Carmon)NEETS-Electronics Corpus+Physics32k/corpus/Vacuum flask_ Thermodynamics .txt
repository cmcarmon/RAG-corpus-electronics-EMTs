The rate of heat (energy) loss through a vacuum flask can be analyzed thermodynamically, starting from the second TdS relation:

{\displaystyle T_{surr}\Delta S=c_{p}\left(T_{b'}-T_{c}\right)}

Where
Tsurr is the temperature of the surrounding air
∆S is the change in specific entropy of stainless steel
cp is the specific heat capacity of stainless steel
Tc is the temperature of the liquid contained within the flask
Tb' is the temperature of the outside surface of the vacuum flask's inner wall

{\displaystyle Q'_{0}=A_{in}\epsilon _{s.s.}\sigma \left[\left(T_{c}+{\frac {T_{surr}\Delta S}{c_{p}}}\right)^{4}-T_{surr}^{4}\right]}

Where
Q'0 is the rate of heat transfer by radiation through the vacuum portion of the flask
Ain is the surface area of the outside of the inner wall of the flask
εs.s. is the emissivity of stainless steel
σ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant
Assuming that the outer surface of the inner wall and the inner surface of the outer wall of the vacuum flask are coated with polished silver to minimize heat loss due to radiation, we can say that the rate of heat absorption by the inner surface of the outer wall is equal to the absorptivity of polished silver times the heat radiated by the outer surface of the inner wall,

We must also consider the rate of heat loss through the lid of the vacuum flask (assuming it is made of polypropylene, a common plastic) where there is no vacuum inside the material. In this area, the three heat transfer modes of conduction, convection, and radiation are present. Therefore, the rate of heat loss through the lid is,

Where
k is the thermal conductivity of air
h is the convective heat transfer coefficient of free air
εp.p is the emissivity of polypropylene
Alid is the outer surface area of the lid
cpp.p. is the specific heat capacity of polypropylene
∆Sp.p. is the specific entropy of polypropylene
∆x is the distance over which conduction across the temperature gradient takes place
Now we have an expression for the total rate of heat loss, which is the sum of the rate of heat loss through the walls of the vacuum flask and the rate of heat loss through the lid,
