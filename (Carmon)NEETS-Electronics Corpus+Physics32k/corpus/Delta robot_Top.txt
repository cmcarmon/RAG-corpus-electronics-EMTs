A delta robot is a type of parallel robot. It consists of three arms connected to universal joints at the base. The key design feature is the use of parallelograms in the arms, which maintains the orientation of the end effector. By contrast, a Stewart platform can change the orientation of its end effector.
Delta robots have popular usage in picking and packaging in factories because they can be quite fast, some executing up to 300 picks per minute.
