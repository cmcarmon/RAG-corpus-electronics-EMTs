illustrated in figure 3-12; a two-pole generator must rotate at four times the speed of an eight-pole
generator to produce the same frequency of generated voltage. The frequency of any ac generator in hertz
(Hz), which is the number of cycles per second, is related to the number of poles and the speed of
rotation, as expressed by the equation
