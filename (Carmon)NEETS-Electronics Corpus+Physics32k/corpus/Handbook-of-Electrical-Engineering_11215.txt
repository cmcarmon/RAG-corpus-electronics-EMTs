Frequency Analysis of the EEG
In general, the EEG contains information regarding changes in the electrical potential of the brain obtained
from a given set of recording electrodes. These data include the characteristic waveform with its variation in
amplitude, frequency, phase, etc. and the occurrence of brief electrical patterns, such as spindles. Any analysis
procedure cannot simultaneously provide information regarding all of these variables. Consequently, the selec-
tion of any analytic technique will emphasize changes in one particular variable at the expense of the others.
This  observation  is  extremely  important  if  one  is  to  properly  interpret  the  results  obtained  by  any  analytic
technique. In this chapter, special attention is given to frequency analysis of the EEG.
