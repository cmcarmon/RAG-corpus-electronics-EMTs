A bridge rectifier is a type of full-wave rectifier be-
cause it operates on both half-cycles of the input sine 
wave. The advantage of the bridge rectifier is that the 
circuit does not require a center-tapped secondary. 
This circuit does not require a transformer to operate. 
A transformer is used only to step up or step down the 
voltage or provide isolation.
