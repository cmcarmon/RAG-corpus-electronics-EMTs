Because the unit of the ”horsepower” doesn’t coincide exactly with speed in revolutions per
minute multiplied by torque in pound-feet, we can’t say that horsepower equals ST. However,
they are proportional to one another. As the mathematical product of ST changes, the value
for horsepower will change by the same proportion.
