In the overhead throwing motion the body is a kinetic chain, and the efficiency of the kinetic chain determines the quality of the throw (velocity and accuracy of the projectile). The thrower uses muscle segments throughout the whole body to transfer potential energy from the lower extremities to the upper extremities where it is then transformed into kinetic energy as the projectile is released.
