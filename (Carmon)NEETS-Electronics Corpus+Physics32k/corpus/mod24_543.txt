The discussion on field measurements is limited to optical fiber and optical connection properties.
Optical fiber and optical connection field measurements evaluate only the transmission properties affected
by component or system installation or repair. Because optical fiber geometrical properties, such as core
and cladding diameter and numerical aperture, are not expected to change, there is no need to remeasure
these properties. The optical fiber properties that are likely to change include fiber attenuation (loss) and
bandwidth. Bandwidth changes in the field tend to be beneficial, so field bandwidth measurement is
generally not performed. If field bandwidth measurements are required, they are essentially the same as
laboratory measurements so they will not be repeated. The optical connection properties that are likely to
change are connection insertion loss and reflectance and return loss.
