▶✓ Value: Component values are sometimes shown for passive parts, such 
as resistors and capacitors, that don’t go by conventional part numbers. 
For example, when indicating a resistor, the value (in ohms) could be 
marked beside the resistor symbol or the reference ID. Most often, you’ll 
see just the value without a label for the unit of measurement (ohms, 
microfarads, and so on). Normally resistor values are assumed to be in 
ohms, and capacitor values are assumed to be in microfarads.
