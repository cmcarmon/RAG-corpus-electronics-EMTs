A  typical  overhead  single-phase  three-wire  120/240-V  secondary  system  is  shown  in  Fig.  65.3.  The  three
distribution transformers are mounted on separate primary feeder poles and supplied from different phases.
Each transformer supplies 6 to 12 houses. The transformers are protected by fuses. The secondary feeders and
the service drops are not protected individually. The secondary feeder uses insulated No. 1/0 or 4/0 aluminum
conductors. The average secondary length is from 200 to 600 ft. The typical load is from 15 to 30 W/ft.
