Mathematical physicist Frank Tipler generalizes Teilhard's term Omega Point to describe what he maintains is the ultimate fate of the universe required by the laws of physics: roughly, Tipler argues that quantum mechanics is inconsistent unless the future of every point in spacetime contains an intelligent observer to collapse the wavefunction, and that the only way for this to happen is if the Universe is closed (that is, it will collapse to a single point) and yet contains observers with a "God-like" ability to perform an unbounded series of observations in finite time. However, scientists such as Lawrence Krauss have stated that Tipler's reasoning is erroneous on multiple levels, possibly to the point of being nonsensical pseudoscience. Tipler (1994) has summarized his hypothesis as follows:
The universe has finite spatial size and the topology of a three-sphere;
There are no event horizons, implying the future c-boundary is a point, called the Omega Point;
Sentient life must eventually engulf the entire universe and control it;
The amount of information processed between now and the Omega Point is infinite;
The amount of information stored in the universe asymptotically goes to infinity as the Omega Point is approached.
