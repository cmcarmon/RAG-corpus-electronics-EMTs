Reliability and Availability
Being a shared resource, the LAN should have a high degree of reliability and availability. The media should
not  be  a  single  point  of  failure,  and  no  individual  station  should  be  able  to  prevent—maliciously  or  other-
wise—the delivery of service to other stations. LANs are designed to withstand both transient and permanent
failures of the media and stations.
