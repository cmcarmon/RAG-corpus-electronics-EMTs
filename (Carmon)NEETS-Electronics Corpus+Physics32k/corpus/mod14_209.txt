If the statement "Today is payday" is FALSE, then the statement "Today is NOT payday" must be
TRUE. This is called the COMPLEMENT of the original statement. In the case of computer math,
complement is defined as the opposite or negative form of the original statement or variable. If today
were payday, then the statement "Today is not payday" would be FALSE. The complement is shown by
placing a bar, or VINCULUM, over the statement symbol (in this case, P ). This variable is spoken as
NOT P. Table 2-1 shows this concept and the relationship with logic states and logic levels.
