Being positive about capacitor polarity
Some larger‐value electrolytic capacitors (1 μF and up) are polarized — 
meaning that the positive terminal must be kept at a higher voltage than the 
negative terminal, so it matters which way you insert the capacitor into your 
circuit. Polarized capacitors are designed for use in DC circuits.
