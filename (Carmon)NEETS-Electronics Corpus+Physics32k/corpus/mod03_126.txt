For higher current ranges (above 50 amperes) ammeters that use external shunts are used. The
external shunt resistor serves the same purpose as the internal shunt resistor. The external shunt is
connected in series with the circuit to be measured and in parallel with the ammeter. This shunts
(bypasses) the ammeter so only a portion of the current goes through the meter. Each external shunt will
be marked with the maximum current value that the ammeter will measure when that shunt is used. Figure
1-23 shows an ammeter that is designed to use external shunts and a dâ€™Arsonval meter movement. Figure
1-23(A) shows the internal construction of the meter and the way in which the external shunt is connected
to the meter and to the circuit being measured. Figure 1-23(C) shows some typical external shunts.
