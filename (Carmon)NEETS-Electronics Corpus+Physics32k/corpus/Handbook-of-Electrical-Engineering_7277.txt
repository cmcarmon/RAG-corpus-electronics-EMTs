As the penetration of personal computers nears a one-to-one relationship with phones in the ofﬁce workplace,
the limitations of separate voice and data networks will become even more evident. If these problems are not
addressed,  an  organization’s  ﬂexibility  in  redeploying “people  assets”  and  ultimately  competitiveness  will  be
seriously hindered. The time it takes to move/add/change equipment and reconﬁgure communications wires
will be the limiting factor in rapidly reorganizing workgroups and responding to new assignments. Wireless
LANs  will  become  an  attractive  solution  in  the  ofﬁce  of  the  1990s,  interconnecting  personal  computers  and
offering data communications capabilities without the need for elaborate cabling methodologies. The obvious
and inherent ﬂexibility offered by wireless LANs is the obvious primary beneﬁt. However, the ability to retrieve
that investment, never retrievable until now, clearly presents a signiﬁcant economical beneﬁt.
