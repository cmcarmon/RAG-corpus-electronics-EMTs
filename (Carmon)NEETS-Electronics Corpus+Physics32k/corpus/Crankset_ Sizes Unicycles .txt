Unicycle cranks vary in length to accommodate different unicycle wheel sizes, and different unicycling disciplines. As almost all unicycles are ungeared, crank length is a major factor in determining how much force is transmitted to the wheel. Larger wheel diameters (26" to 36") require longer cranks , as do disciplines such as Mountain Unicycling, Trials, Street, and Flatland. These unicycles and disciplines commonly use cranks lengths greater than 125mm. For indoor unicycling such as freestyle or hockey, shorter cranks give a smoother pedaling motion and enable tighter turns without the pedal hitting the floor. Crank lengths of 100mm are common, although some riders use cranks as short as 79mm.
As there is no chainwheel on a unicycle, both right and left cranks are identical, except for the pedal attachment thread in the left-hand crank, which is reverse threaded.
