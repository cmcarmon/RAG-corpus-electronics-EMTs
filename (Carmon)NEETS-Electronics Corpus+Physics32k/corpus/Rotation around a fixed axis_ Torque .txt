Torque




τ



{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}}
is the twisting effect of a force F applied to a rotating object which is at position r from its axis of rotation. Mathematically,





τ

=

r

×

F

,


{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}=\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {F} ,}

where × denotes the cross product. A net torque acting upon an object will produce an angular acceleration of the object according to





τ

=
I

α

,


{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}=I{\boldsymbol {\alpha }},}

just as F = ma in linear dynamics.
The work done by a torque acting on an object equals the magnitude of the torque times the angle through which the torque is applied:




W
=
τ
θ
.



{\displaystyle W=\tau \theta .\!}

The power of a torque is equal to the work done by the torque per unit time, hence:




P
=
τ
ω
.



{\displaystyle P=\tau \omega .\!}
