As you can see in figure 3-13, the output signal is 180 degrees out of phase with the input signal. The
feedback signal is a portion of the output signal and, therefore, also 180 degrees out of phase with the
input signal. Whenever the input signal goes positive, the output signal and the feedback signal go
negative. The result of this is that the inverting input to the operational amplifier is always very close to 0
volts with this configuration. In fact, with the noninverting input grounded, the voltage at the inverting
input to the operational amplifier is so small compared to other voltages in the circuit that it is considered
to be VIRTUAL GROUND. (Remember, in a closed-loop operation the inverting and noninverting inputs
are at the same potential.)
