For the assignment of terminal variables shown in Figure 1.32,
v = âˆ’5 V.
Notice the distinction between terminal variables and element properties in this
example. The source voltage of 5 V is an element property, while v is a terminal variable
that we have defined. Similarly, the polarity markings inside the circle are a property of
the source, while the polarity markings outside the circle representing the source relate
to the terminal variable v. When possible, we attempt to write the element values inside
the element symbol, while the terminal variables are written outside.
