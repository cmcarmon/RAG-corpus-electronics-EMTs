It doesn’t matter which test lead is placed on what side of the resistor, 
because resistors don’t care about polarity.
Take care not to let your fingers touch the metal tips of the test leads 
or the leads of the resistor. If you touch them, you add the resistance of 
your body into the reading, producing an inaccurate result.
