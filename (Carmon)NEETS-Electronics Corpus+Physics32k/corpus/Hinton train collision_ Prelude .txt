On the morning of February 8, 1986, Via Rail's No. 4 train, the combined Super Continental and Skeena, was travelling from Jasper east to Edmonton on its transcontinental journey. It consisted of 14 units in the following order:
FP7 Diesel locomotive number 6566
F9 Diesel locomotive number 6633
Baggage car
Coach
Dome car number 513
Sleeping car
Sleeping car
FP9 Diesel locomotive number 6300 (inoperative)
Steam generator car
Baggage car
Coach
Lounge car
Sleeping car
Steam generator car
The unusual make up of the train was the result of two separate trains being coupled together in Jasper. The first 2 locomotives and 5 cars had originated in Vancouver, and the second section consisting of 1 locomotive and 5 cars had originated in Prince Rupert. The last car, a steam generator, was added in Jasper on its way to Edmonton for maintenance. One hundred and fifteen people were on board the train; 94 passengers, 14 stewards and seven crew.
Canadian National Railway's westbound train No. 413 consisted of three locomotives, EMD GP38-2W number 5586, and two EMD SD40 numbers 5062 and 5104, followed by a high-speed spreader, 35 cylindrical hoppers loaded with grain, seven bulkhead flat cars loaded with large pipes, 45 hoppers loaded with sulphur, 20 loaded tank cars, six more grain cars, and a caboose; a total consist of 3 locomotives 115 cars. It was 6,124 feet (1,867 m) long and weighed 12,804 short tons (11,432 long tons; 11,616 t). On the lead locomotive were engineer John Edward (Jack) Hudson, aged 48, and brakeman Mark Edwards, aged 25. On the caboose, conductor Wayne "Smitty" Smith, aged 33.
The freight train left Edson at 6:40 am, and took the siding at Medicine Lodge to allow two eastbound trains to pass. It departed Medicine Lodge at 8:02 am and reached Hargwen at 8:20 am, where a section of double track started. The train dispatcher at Edmonton had lined the dual control switch (DCS) so that the train was lined up onto the north track. At the same time, the Super Continental stopped at Hinton, and left five minutes late.
At 8:29 am, the dispatcher lined the DCS at Dalehurst, where the section of double track ended, to allow the Super Continental to take the south track. This turnout configuration at Dalehurst would have caused the absolute (home) signal at the control point to display a stop indication. The double-aspect approach signal 13,600 feet (4.1 km) east of Dalehurst showed an approach indication, yellow over red (meaning prepare to stop at the next signal while reducing speed to 30 miles per hour (48 km/h)). As the train approached this signal, the throttle was in the 8th notch with the train speed at 59 miles per hour (95 km/h), 9 miles per hour (14 km/h) faster than the 50 miles per hour (80 km/h) limit on this stretch of track. The engineer made no attempt to slow down after passing the approach signal.
Further west, there was an absolute three-aspect signal, 490 feet (150 m) east of the switch at Dalehurst that showed three solid-red lamps, indicating a stop. The freight still did not slow down, instead running through the DCS and entering the section of single track occupied by the Super Continental. Had the Super Continental been even a minute early, it would have been past the DCS at this point, but it was not. Seconds after the freight ran through the switch, at 8:40 am, the two trains collided.
