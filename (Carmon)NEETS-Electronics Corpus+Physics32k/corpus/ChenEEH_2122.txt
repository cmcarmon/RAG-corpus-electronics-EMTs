Electromagnetics is fundamental in electrical and electronic
engineering. Electromagnetic theory based on Maxwell’s equa-
tions establishes the basic principle of electrical and electronic
circuits over the entire frequency spectrum from dc to optics.
It is the basis of Kirchhoff ’s current and voltage laws for low-
frequency circuits and Snell’s law of reﬂection in optics. For
low-frequency applications, the physics of electricity and mag-
netism are uncoupled. Coulomb’s law for electric ﬁeld and
potential and Ampere’s law for magnetic ﬁeld govern the
physical principles. Infrared and optical applications are usu-
ally described in the content of photonics or optics as separate
subjects. This section emphasizes the engineering applications
of electromagnetic ﬁeld theory that relate directly to the
coupling of space and time-dependent vector electric and
magnetic ﬁelds, and, therefore, most of the subjects focus on
microwave and millimeter-wave regimes. The eleven chapters
in this section cover a broad area of applied electromagnetics,
including fundamental electromagnetic ﬁeld theory, guided
waves, antennas and radiation, microwave components,
numerical methods, and radar and inverse scattering.
