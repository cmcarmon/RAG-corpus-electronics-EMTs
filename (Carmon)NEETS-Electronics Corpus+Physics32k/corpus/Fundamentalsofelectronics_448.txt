Figure 4.15: The ideal frequency response of the vocal tract as it produces the sounds “oh” and “ee”
are shown on the top left and top right, respectively. The spectral peaks are known as formants, and
are numbered consecutively from low to high frequency. The bottom plots show speech waveforms
corresponding to these sounds.
