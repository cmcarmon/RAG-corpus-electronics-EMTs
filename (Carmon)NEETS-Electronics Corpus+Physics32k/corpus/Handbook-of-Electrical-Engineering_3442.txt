More  generally,  however,  thermal  design  in  the  1990s  is  aimed  at  preventing  thermally  induced  physical
failures, through reduction of the temperature rise above ambient and minimization of temperature variations
within the packaging structure(s). The use of many low-temperature materials and the structural complexity
of chip packages and printed circuit boards has increased the risk of catastrophic failures associated with the
vaporization of organic materials, the melting of solders, and thermal-stress fracture of leads, joints, and seals,
as well as the fatigue-induced delamination and fracture or creep-induced deformation of encapsulants and
