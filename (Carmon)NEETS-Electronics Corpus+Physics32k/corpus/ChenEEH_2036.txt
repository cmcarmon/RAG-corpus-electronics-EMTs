The plots in Figure 8.20 clearly show the signiﬁcant improve-
ments in coverage of the hybrid checksum test with respect to
both the mantissa and the ﬂoating point checksum tests. For
the low false alarm case, the mantissa checksum test has supe-
rior coverage compared to the ﬂoating point checksum test.
An important point to be noted that is not apparent from the
plots of Figure 8.20 is that the mantissa checksum test detects
100% of all multiplication errors for both matrix multipli-
cation and LU decomposition.
