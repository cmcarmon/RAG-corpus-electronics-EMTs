as parameters. For real devices, m is usually slightly larger than
one due to recombination loss and nonabrupt doping proﬁles,
for example. A typical characteristic is shown in Figure 5.3
where the various bias regions are indicated. At very low
forward bias recombination dominates and results in m ¼ 2.
At high-current densities and high injection, respectively,
