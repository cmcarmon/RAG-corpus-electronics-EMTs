Multilayer perceptrons are a layered arrangement of nonlinear PEs as shown in Fig. 20.2. The layer that receives
. The layers that do
the input is called the 
. A layered network with just the input and
not have direct access to the external world are called 
output layers is called the 
weight,
which is adapted during learning.
