EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE.â€”Temperature changes affect the resistance of materials in
different ways. In some materials an increase in temperature causes an increase in resistance, whereas in
others, an increase in temperature causes a decrease in resistance. The amount of change of resistance per
unit change in temperature is known as the TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENT. If for an increase in
temperature the resistance of a material increases, it is said to have a POSITIVE TEMPERATURE
COEFFICIENT. A material whose resistance decreases with an increase in temperature has a
NEGATIVE TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENT. Most conductors used in electronic applications have a
positive temperature coefficient. However, carbon, a frequently used material, is a substance having a
negative temperature coefficient. Several materials, such as the alloys constantan and manganin, are
considered to have a ZERO TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENT because their resistance remains relatively
constant for changes in temperature.
