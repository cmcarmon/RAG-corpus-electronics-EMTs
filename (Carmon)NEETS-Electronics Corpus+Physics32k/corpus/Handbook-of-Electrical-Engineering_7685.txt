Nonvolatile Programmable Memories
A few nonvolatile memories are programmable just once. These have
 in series with
arrays of diodes or transistors with fuses or 
each  semiconductor  cross  point.  Aluminum,  titanium,  tungsten,
platinum silicide, and polysilicon have all been successfully used as
fuse technology (see Fig. 80.5).
