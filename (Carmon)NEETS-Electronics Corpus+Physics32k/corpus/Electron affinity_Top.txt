In chemistry and atomic physics, the electron affinity of an atom or molecule is defined as the amount of energy released or spent when an electron is added to a neutral atom or molecule in the gaseous state to form a negative ion.

X + e− → X− + energy

In solid state physics, the electron affinity for a surface is defined somewhat differently (see below).
