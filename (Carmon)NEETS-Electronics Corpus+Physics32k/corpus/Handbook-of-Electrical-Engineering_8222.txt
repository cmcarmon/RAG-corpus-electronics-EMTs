The sustain electrodes shown in Fig. 83.31 are made of a conductive transparent material such as tin oxide.
Unfortunately, the resistance is orders of magnitude too high. To correct this problem, narrow bus electrodes
of high conductivity materials, such as silver or chrome-copper-chrome, are placed over the tin oxide to reduce
the electrode resistance to values on the order of 100 ohms.
