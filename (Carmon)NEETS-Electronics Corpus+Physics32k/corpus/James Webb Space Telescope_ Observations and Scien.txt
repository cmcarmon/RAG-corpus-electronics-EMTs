JWST observing time will be allocated through a Director's Discretionary Early Release Science (DD-ERS) Program, a Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) Program, and a General Observers (GO) Program. The GTO Program provides guaranteed observing time for scientists who developed hardware and software components for the observatory. The GO Program provides all astronomers the opportunity to apply for observing time. GO programs will be selected through peer review by a Time Allocation Committee (TAC), similar to the proposal review process used for the Hubble Space Telescope. JWST observing time is expected to be highly oversubscribed, meaning that the number of submitted GO proposals will be much larger than the number that can be approved in any observing cycle.
