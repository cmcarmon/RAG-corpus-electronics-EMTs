The rest of this chapter is organized as follows. We discuss
various FD and FT techniques at various levels of application,
down from the circuit up to the application level. For each of
these discussions, we present various important work in that
area and then give a more detailed discussion of work done in
our group. In Section 8.2, we present FD and FT techniques for
arithmetic circuits, whereas in Section 8.3, we explain methods
for Ô¨Åeld-programmable gate arrays that can be considered a mix
