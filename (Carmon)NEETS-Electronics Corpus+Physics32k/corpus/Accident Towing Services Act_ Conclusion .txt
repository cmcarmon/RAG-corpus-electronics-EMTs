The Minister concluded his speech in support of the Accident Towing Services Bill by observing that -

""This Bill establishes Victoria's first stand-alone Accident Towing Services Act and provides a modern and secure platform for better performance in the towing industry. It continues and improves on a proven regulatory framework which has brought criminal and undesirable practices in the industry under control, and which has also protected crash victims and helped enable road accidents scenes to be cleared safely and efficiently in the interests of road safety and congestion management. The Bill also seeks to improve the performance of the industry by introducing a targeted accreditation scheme to ensure that complaints systems are introduced, thereby encouraging accident towing participants to become more focused on providing better customer service. The Bill also enables VicRoads to determine whether service quality is an issue that should be addressed, and to enforce the regulatory framework more effectively. Accreditation is introduced with minimal compliance costs to the industry and modest increased monitoring costs for Government.
