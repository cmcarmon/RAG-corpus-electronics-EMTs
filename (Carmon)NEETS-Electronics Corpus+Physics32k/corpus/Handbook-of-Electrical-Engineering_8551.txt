Microprogram Development
Microassemblers
The ﬁrst level of speciﬁcation of microinstructions is, just like its counterpart at the machine level, the assembler.
Although the process and philosophy is exactly the same, it is traditionally called a microassembler. A microas-
sembler is a software program (it is not relevant to know in which language it is written) whose function is to
translate a source program into the binary code equivalent. Obviously, to write a source program, a language
has to be designed. At assembly level, languages are usually very close to the hardware structure, and the objects
deﬁned  are  microregisters,  gate  level  controls,  and  paths.  Operations  are  the  microoperations  (sometimes
slightly more sophisticated with a microassembler with macrofacilities).
