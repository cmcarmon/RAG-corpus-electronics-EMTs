IFM/CW may be compared with pulse compression radar if both use a wide bandwidth. Pulse compression
employs  a “long”  pulse  (i.e.,  relatively  long  for  a  pulse  radar)  with  a  large  frequency  deviation  or “chirp.” A
long  pulse  is  often  used  when  a  transmitter  is  peak-power  limited,  because  the  longer  pulse  produces  more
