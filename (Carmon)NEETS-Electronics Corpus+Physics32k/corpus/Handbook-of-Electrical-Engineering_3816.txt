Waveguide Losses
There  are  two  mechanisms  that  cause  losses  in  waveguides:  dielectric  losses  and  metal  losses.  In  both  cases,
these losses cause the amplitudes of the propagating modes to decay as exp(- a z), where a is the attenuation
constant,  measured  in  units  of  nepers/meter.  Typically,  the  attenuation  constant  is  considered  as  the  sum  of
