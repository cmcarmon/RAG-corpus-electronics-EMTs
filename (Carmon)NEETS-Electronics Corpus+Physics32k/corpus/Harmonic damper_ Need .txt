The need for a damper will depend on the age of the engine design, its manufacture, strength of components, usable powerband, rev range and, most importantly, the quality of the engine's tune. The engine's tune especially in computer controlled applications can have a dramatic effect on durability, the aggressiveness of the tune puts the engine at risk of detonation which can be catastrophic to all rotating assembly components. Modern (roughly 1988+) DOHC, SOHC flat 4, I4, flat 6, I6, V6, flat 8, and flat-plane V8 have no need for this device. With or without the presence of a damper, a crankshaft will act as a torsional spring to some extent. Impulses applied to the crankshaft by the connecting rods will "wind" this spring, which will respond (as a springâ€“mass system) by unwinding and re-winding in the opposite direction. This crankshaft winding will usually be damped out naturally. However, at certain crankshaft rotational speeds, such winding can overlap with the crankshaft's natural resonant frequency, thereby increasing the frequency's amplitude and possibly leading to crankshaft damage.
