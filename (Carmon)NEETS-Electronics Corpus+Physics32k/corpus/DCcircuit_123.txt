The force motivating electrons to ”ﬂow” in a circuit is called voltage. Voltage is a speciﬁc
measure of potential energy that is always relative between two points. When we speak of a
certain amount of voltage being present in a circuit, we are referring to the measurement of
how much potential energy exists to move electrons from one particular point in that circuit to
another particular point. Without reference to two particular points, the term ”voltage” has no
meaning.
