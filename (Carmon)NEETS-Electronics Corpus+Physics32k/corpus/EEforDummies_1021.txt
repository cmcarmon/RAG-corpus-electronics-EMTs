shopped around for the best deals on resistors and other components. Now 
you’re ready to get down to business and build some light‐flashing, 
noisemaking circuits. So how do you transform an unassuming 
two‐dimensional circuit diagram into a real, live, working 
(maybe even moving) electronic circuit?
