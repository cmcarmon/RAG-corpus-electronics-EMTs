The fact that the ﬁeld of MEMS largely grew out of the IC
industry has been noted often. There is no doubt that the use
of fabrication processes and associated equipment developed
initially for semiconductor industry has given the MEMS
industry the impetus needed to overcome the massive infra-
structure requirements. Less discussed is the additional fact
that the ﬁeld of MEMS has gone far beyond the materials and
processes used for IC production. The situation is indicated
schematically in Figure 6.4. Less than ten materials, notably
silicon and its oxide and nitride, and a similar number of
processes, such as lithography and ion implantation, are gen-
erally employed to make ICs. The set of materials for IC
devices has expanded to include, for example, both low and
high dielectric constant materials. However, compared to
MEMS a relatively small number of materials and processes
are employed now to make IC chips.
