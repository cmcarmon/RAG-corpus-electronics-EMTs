A regular point of



F


{\displaystyle F}
is a point



(

u

,

)


{\displaystyle (\mathbf {u} ,\lambda )}
at which the Jacobian of



F


{\displaystyle F}
is full rank



(

{\displaystyle (n)}
.
Near a regular point the solution component is an isolated curve passing through the regular point (the implicit function theorem). In the figure above the point

{\displaystyle (\mathbf {u} _{0},\lambda _{0})}
is a regular point.
