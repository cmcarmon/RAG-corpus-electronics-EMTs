Magnetism is the most common method of pro-
ducing electrical energy today. If a wire is passed 
through a magnetic field, voltage is produced as long 
as there is motion between the magnetic field and the 
conductor. A device based on this principle is called 
a  generator (Figure 12-2). A generator can produce 
either direct current or alternating current, depending 
on how it is wired. When electrons flow in only one 
direction, the current is called direct	current	(Dc). 
When electrons flow in one direction and then in the 
opposite direction, the current is called alternating	
current	(ac). A generator may be powered by steam 
from nuclear power or coal, water, wind, or gasoline or 
diesel engines. The schematic symbol for a DC genera-
tor and an AC generator is shown in Figure 12-3. The 
second most common method of producing electrical 
energy today is by the use of a chemical cell. The cell
