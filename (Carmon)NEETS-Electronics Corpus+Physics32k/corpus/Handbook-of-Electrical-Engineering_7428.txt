The  transmitters  usually  radiate  from  the  resonant  elements  themselves,  avoiding  elaborate  antennas  that
might be required for longer distance transmission; the receivers use simple dipole or commercial TV antennas.
Thus, industrial radio telemetry has become a carefully engineered blend of the borrowed and the new.
