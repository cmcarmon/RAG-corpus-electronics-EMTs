A bandpass filter passes a narrow band of frequencies through a circuit and attenuates all other 
frequencies that are higher or lower than the desired band of frequencies. This is shown in figure 1-19 
where the greatest current exists at the center frequency (fr). Frequencies below resonance (f1) and 
frequencies above resonance (f2) drop off rapidly and are rejected.
