The back-off algorithm uses the delay of 0 to 2 time units for
the ﬁrst 11 attempts and 0 to 1023 time units for 12 to 16
attempts. The transmitting station gives up when it reaches the
16th attempt. This is the last-in ﬁrst-out unfair algorithm and
requires imposing the minimum frame size for the purpose of
collision detection. In principle, the minimum frame size is
based on the signal propagation delay on the network and is
different between baseband and broadband networks. The
baseband network uses digital signaling, and there is only
one channel used for the transmission, while the broadband
network uses analog signaling, and it can have more than one
channel. One channel is used for transmitting, and another
channel can be used for receiving. The baseband network has
two times the propagation delay between the farthest stations
in the network, and the broadband network has four times the
propagation delay from the station to the headend, with two
stations close to each other and as far as possible from the
‘‘headend.’’ The delay is the minimum transmission time and
can be converted into the minimum frame size.
