The frequency response of filters often deals with gain and frequency values that 
vary over many orders of magnitude. Therefore, it is often more convenient to describe 
these quantities using a logarithmic scale. The conventional scale used to describe gain is 
the decibel (dB) scale. For a linear gain A, the gain in dB is,
