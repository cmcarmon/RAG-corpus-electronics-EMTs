To illustrate the typical behavior of second-order circuits, and to moti-
vate their study, consider the behavior of the two cascaded inverters shown in
Figure 12.1. Given a square-wave input to the first inverter at vIN1, we expect
to see a square-wave output at vOUT1 and vIN2, as illustrated in Figure 12.2.
However, in Chapter 9 we saw that the presence of the parasitic MOSFET
gate capacitance in the second inverter results in the slower output waveform
