are turned on sequentially by pulsing the LEDs and thus create a full matrix of light beams without requiring
each  of  them  to  be  on  continuously.  This  system  does  not  reduce  the  screen  transmissivity  as  there  is  no
obstruction of the screen output, but it is limited in resolution to the number of LED detector pairs that can
be placed on the periphery of the screen.
