Bode plots were originated and named for H. W. Bode, 
who used the plots for studying amplifier feedback. 
The original plots required semilog graph paper. Two 
graphs were required: one for gain in decibels plotted 
against frequency on the log scale and the other for 
phase shift in degrees plotted against frequency on the 
log scale. The arrival of computer simulations such as 
National Instrumentâ€™s Multisim has resulted in greater 
utilization of Bode plotters.
