Peter D. Jarvis is an Australian physicist notable for his work on applications of group theory to physical problems, particularly supersymmetry in the genetic code. He has also applied classical invariant theory to problems of quantum physics (entanglement measures for mixed state systems), and also to phylogenetic reconstruction (entanglement measures, including distance measures, for taxonomic pattern frequencies).
