From the example of the dielectric sphere and equation 2.44, it
can be seen that the permittivity function is an expression of
the fact that an applied E ﬁeld induces dipole moments inside
material objects. There are two common physical mechanisms
for the creation of these induced dipole moments inside
matter. The ﬁrst is the rotation of existing permanently polar-
ized subregions (‘‘dipoles’’) inside the material into partial
alignment with the applied ﬁeld through the torque of equa-
tion 2.28. These subregions can be individual molecules, as in
the polar molecules of water, or domains consisting of thou-
sands of atoms, as in ferroelectric ceramics. The second mech-
anism is the creation of dipoles by charge separation in initially
nonpolar atoms or molecules. In this case, the electron clouds
are pulled in one direction by the E-ﬁeld, while the positive
nuclei are pushed in the opposite direction. Lorrain and Cor-
son (1970), Clemmow (1973), and Bunget and Popescu (1984)
provide excellent introductions to the subject of the physics of
dielectrics. Work by von Hippel (1995) is the standard engi-
neering reference on dielectric materials.
