Insulators are materials that do not allow charge to move easily. Examples include glass,
plastic, ceramics, and rubber. Electric current cannot be made to ﬂow through an insulator, since
a charge has great difﬁculty moving through it. One sees insulating (or dielectric) materials often
wrapped around the center conducting core of a wire.
