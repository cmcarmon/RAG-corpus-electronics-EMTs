Reaction Time (RT): the time taken by an individual to start shifting his center of gravity (COG) from the static position after the cue, measured in seconds
Movement Velocity (MVL): the average speed at which the COG shifts
EndPoint Excursions (EPE): the distance willingly covered by the subject in his very first attempt towards the target, expressed as a percentage
Maximum Excursions (MXE): the amount of distance the subject actually covered or moved his COG
Directional Control (DCL): a comparison between the amount of movement demonstrated in the desired direction, i.e. towards the target, to the amount of external movement in the opposite direction of the target, expressed as a percentage
