An audio amplifier has been described as an amplifier with a frequency response from 15 Hz to 20 
kHz. The frequency response of an amplifier can be shown graphically with a frequency response curve. 
Figure 1-22 is the ideal frequency response curve for an audio amplifier. This curve is practically "flat" 
from 15 Hz to 20 kHz. This means that the gain of the amplifier is equal between 15 Hz and 20 kHz. 
Above 20 kHz or below 15 Hz the gain decreases or "drops off" quite rapidly. The frequency response of 
an amplifier is determined by the components in the circuit.
