ASAP and ALAP scheduling algorithms order computational units based on data dependencies. List scheduling
is based on ASAP and ALAP scheduling, but considers additional, more-global constraints, such as maximum
number of control steps. Force-directed scheduling computes the probabilities of computational units being
assigned to control steps and attempts to evenly distribute computation activity among all control steps. Control
step  splitting  starts  with  all  computational  units  assigned  to  one  control  step  and  generates  a  schedule  by
splitting the computational units into multiple control steps. Control step merging starts with all computational
units assigned to individual control steps and generates a schedule by merging or combining units and steps
