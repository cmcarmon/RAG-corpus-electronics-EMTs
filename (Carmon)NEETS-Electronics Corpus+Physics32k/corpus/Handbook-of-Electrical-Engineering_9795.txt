When  time-variable  systems  are  encountered,  the  option  of  using  high-order  differential  or  difference
equations versus sets of ﬁrst-order state equations is still open. The system coefﬁcients  ai(t), bj(t) and/or the
matrices A(t), B(t), C(t), and D(t) will now be time-varying. Transfer function approaches lose most of their
utility in time-varying cases and are seldom used. With nonlinear systems all the options relating to the order
and number of differential or difference equation still apply.
