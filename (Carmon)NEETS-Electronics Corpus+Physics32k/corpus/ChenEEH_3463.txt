Generators need to be protected from the internal faults as
well as the abnormal operating conditions. Since generators
consist of two parts, namely the stator and the rotor, protec-
tion of both is required. The stator is protected from both
phase and ground faults, while the rotor is protected against
ground faults and loss of Ô¨Åeld excitation. Due to the particular
conditions required for the synchronous machine to operate,
a number of operating conditions that represent either a
power system disturbance or operational hazard need to be
avoided. The conditions associated with network disturbances
are overvoltage or undervoltage, unbalanced currents, network
