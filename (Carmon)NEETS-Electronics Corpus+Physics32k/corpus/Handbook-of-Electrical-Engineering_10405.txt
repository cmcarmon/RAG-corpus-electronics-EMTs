h. Displays  and  workstations.  High-resolution  displays  combined  with  programmable  workstations  and
software  lead  to  ﬂexible  node  functions  and  consequently  to  ﬂexible  architectures.  A  C3  workstation
could, in principle, support any of a number of C3I functions; a relocation of operators may be the only
requirement to physically relocate a command node. Numerous decision aids are now being included
within workstations and with their more comprehensive capability are now often described as decision
support systems (DSS). Man-machine interface (MMI), as a result, grows in importance.
