The IEEE 802.5 Token Passing Ring protocol uses the ring
topology where repeaters are connected via a transmission
medium to form a closed path. Data are transmitted serially
bit by bit through the transmission media, and they regenerate
the bits at each repeater before they are sent to the next
repeater on the ring. Data are transmitted in packets. A re-
peater should perform the packet reception, transmission, and
removal functions. A repeater can be one of three states: listen,
transmit, and bypass states. A user station is connected to the
repeater and contains the MAPs, which is summarized below:
