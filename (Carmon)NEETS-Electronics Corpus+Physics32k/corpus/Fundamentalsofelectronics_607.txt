Figure 5.12: The initial decomposition of a length-8 DFT into the terms using even- and odd-indexed
inputs marks the Ô¨Årst phase of developing the FFT algorithm. When these half-length transforms are
successively decomposed, we are left with the diagram shown in the bottom panel that depicts the
length-8 FFT computation.
