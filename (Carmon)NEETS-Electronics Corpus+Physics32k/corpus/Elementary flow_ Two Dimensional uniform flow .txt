y




{\displaystyle \mathbf {V_{0}} =v_{0}cos(\theta _{0})\mathbf {e} _{x}+v_{0}sin(\theta _{0})\mathbf {e} _{y}}

This flow is incompressible because the velocity is constant, the first derivatives of the velocity components are zero, and the total divergence is zero:



∇
⋅

v

=
0


{\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf {v} =0}

Given the circulation is always zero the flow is also irrotational, we can derive this from the Kelvin's circulation theorem and from the explicit computation of the Vorticity:

∂

=

{\displaystyle \omega _{z}=\partial v_{x}/\partial y-\partial v_{y}/\partial x=0}

Being incompressible and two dimensional this flow is constructed from a stream function

{\displaystyle v_{x}=-\partial \psi /\partial y}






v

{\displaystyle v_{y}=\partial \psi /\partial x}

{\displaystyle \psi =-v_{0}sin(\theta _{0})x+v_{0}cos(\theta _{0})y}

And in cilyndrical coordinates:

{\displaystyle v_{r}=-1/r\partial \psi /\partial \theta }

{\displaystyle \psi =-v_{0}rsin(\theta -\theta _{0})}

As usual the stream function is defined up to a constant value which here we take as zero. We can also confirm that the flow is irrotational from

ψ
=

{\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}\psi =0}

Being irrotational, The potential function is instead:

{\displaystyle v_{x}=-\partial \phi /\partial x}






v

y
