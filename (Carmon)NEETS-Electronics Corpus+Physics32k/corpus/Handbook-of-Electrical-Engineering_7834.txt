(a) Push-pull sensor for tracking on grooves. (b) Calculated distribution of light intensity at the detector
plane when the disk is in focus and the beam is centered on track. (c) Calculated intensity distribution at the detector plane
with  disk  in  focus  but  the  beam  centered  on  the  groove  edge.  (d)  Same  as  (c)  except  for  the  spot  being  focused  on  the
opposite edge of the groove.
