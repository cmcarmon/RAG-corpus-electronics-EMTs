Bottom-up  IC  design  is  also  hierarchical,  with  the  designer  completing  detailed  layout  of  a  speciÔ¨Åc  logic
function  (e.g.,  a  binary  adder),  placing  that  detailed  layout  (a cell)  in  a  library  of  physical  designs  and  then
reusing  that  library  cell  when  other  instantiations  of  the  cell  are  required  elsewhere  in  the  IC.  Figure 25.29
illustrates this cell-based approach, with cells of common height but varying width placed in rows between the
power and ground lines. The straight power and ground lines shown in Fig. 25.29 allow tight packing of adjacent
rows.
