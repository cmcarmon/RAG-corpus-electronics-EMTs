There has been signiﬁcant interest and publicity regarding wireless in-building communications lately, both
for data and voice. Throughout the 1980s, we have seen the development of a signiﬁcant range of in-building

increasingly  are  having  to  face  signiﬁcant  time,  cost,  and  logistical  problems  associated  with  the  installation,
movement, and management of computing and communications equipment in dynamic ofﬁce environments.
