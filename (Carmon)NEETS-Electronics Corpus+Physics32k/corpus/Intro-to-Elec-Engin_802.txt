As with ECL, the logic swing is small, thereby implying vulnerability to noise. While MOS can
be made compatible with TTL, IIL voltage ranges are incompatible with other families. The IIL
is used inside LSI blocks, with interfacing circuits provided at the inputs and outputs to make the
blocks externally compatible with TTL.
