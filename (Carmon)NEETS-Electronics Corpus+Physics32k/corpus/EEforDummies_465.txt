The induction coil, or inductor, stores electrical energy 
in a magnetic field and shapes electrical signals in 
a different way than does a capacitor. Whether 
operating alone, in special pairs known as trans-
formers, or as part of a team along with capacitors 
and resistors, inductors are at the heart of many 
modern‚Äêday conveniences you might not want to 
live without, including radio systems, television, 
and the electric power transmission network.
