An electrochemical sensor that determines the amount of a substance by means of
an  oxidation-reduction  reaction  involving  that  substance.  Electrons  are  transferred  as  a  part  of  the
reaction, so that the electrical current through the sensor is related to the amount of the substance seen
by the sensor.
