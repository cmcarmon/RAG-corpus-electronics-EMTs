To provide direct access to any word in the main memory in a short and ﬁxed amount of time, a distinct
address number is associated with each word location. A given word is accessed by specifying its address and
issuing a control command that starts the storage or retrieval process. The number of bits in a word is called
the  word  length  of  the  computer.  Word  lengths  vary  from  16  to  64  bits.  Small  machines  such  as  personal
computers  or  workstations,  may  have  only  a  few  million  words  in  the  main  memory,  while  larger  machines
have tens of millions of words. The time required to access a word for reading or writing is less than 100 ns.
Although primary memory is essential, it tends to be expensive and volatile. Thus cheaper, more permanent,
magnetic  media  secondary  storage  is  used  for  ﬁles  of  information  that  contain  programs  and  data.  A  wide
selection of suitable devices is available, including magnetic disks, drums, diskettes, and tapes.
