In the application of the principle of virtual work it is often convenient to obtain virtual displacements from the velocities of the system. For the n particle system, let the velocity of each particle Pi be Vi, then the virtual displacement δri can also be written in the form

{\displaystyle \delta \mathbf {r} _{i}=\sum _{j=1}^{m}{\frac {\partial \mathbf {V} _{i}}{\partial {\dot {q}}_{j}}}\delta q_{j},\quad i=1,\ldots ,n.}

This means that the generalized force, Qj, can also be determined as
