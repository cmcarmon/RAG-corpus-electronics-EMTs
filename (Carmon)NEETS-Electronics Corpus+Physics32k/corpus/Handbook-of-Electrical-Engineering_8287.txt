The  state  of  the  LFSR  is  denoted  by  the  binary  state  of  its  cells.  In  Fig. 85.6,  the  next  state  of  each  cell  is

determined by the implementation given by its polynomial and can be summarized as follows: 
s
 at each clock cycle. If the LFSR is initialized in a
i
0
nonzero state, it cycles through a sequence of states and eventually comes back to the initial state, following
the functionality of the next-state rules implemented by its polynomial description. An LFSR that goes through
primitive polynomial (see theory of Galois ﬁelds
all possible 2
for the deﬁnition of primitive), and such polynomials can be found from tables [Bardell et al., 1987].
