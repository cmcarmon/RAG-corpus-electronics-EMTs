The  quantization  process  is  necessary  because  all  information  to  be  processed  using  computers  must  be
represented  by  numbers.  The  quantization  process  can  be  thought  of  as  one  where  the  input  energy  to  the
transducer is represented by a ﬁnite number of energy values. If the energy at a particular pixel location does
not  take  on  one  of  the  ﬁnite  energy  values,  it  is  assigned  to  the  closest  value.  For  instance,  suppose  that  we
 that only energy values of 10, 20, 50, and 110 will be represented (the units are of no concern
assume 
in this example). Suppose at one pixel an energy of 23.5 was observed by the transducer. The A/D converter
would then assign this pixel the energy value of 20 (the closest one). Notice that the quantization process makes
mistakes; this error in assignment is known as
