inverted polarity by asserting an additional signal line that
indicates bus inversion (Stan and Burleson, 1995). The
number can be used to reduce the weight (the number of
ones or zeros) of the binary numbers if the bus-inversion
decision is made when the weight is more than half of the
bus width. The bus-invert method is as follows:
