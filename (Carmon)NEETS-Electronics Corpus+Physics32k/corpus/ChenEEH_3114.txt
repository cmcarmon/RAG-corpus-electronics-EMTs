ticular speed–torque characteristics. Classes A through D are
common squirrel cage designs. Typical torque–slip curves are
shown in Figure 4.21. The motor designs differ mainly in the
design of the rotor bars. As explained, by increasing the rotor
resistance, the starting torque is increased and the slip at pull-out
is reduced. By changing the rotor reactance, the starting current
can be regulated. Class A machines have rotors with large bar
cross sections, which give large starting currents, high efﬁciency,
and relatively low starting torque. A class D motor, on the other
hand, will have a smaller bar cross section and, therefore, has
high starting torque, lower efﬁciency, and lower starting current.
