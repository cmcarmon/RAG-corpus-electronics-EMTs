Photo-actuation in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) has been demonstrated in proof-of-concept experiments., Instead of a typical substrate, a specialized cantilever is placed on top of the liquid-insulator-photoconductor stack. As light is shined on the photoconductor, the capillary force from the drop on the cantilever changes with the contact angle, and deflects the beam. This wireless actuation can be used as a substitute for complex circuit-based systems currently used for optical addressing and control of autonomous wireless sensors
