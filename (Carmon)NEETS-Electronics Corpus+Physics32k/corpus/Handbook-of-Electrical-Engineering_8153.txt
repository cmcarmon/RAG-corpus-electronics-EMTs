The Electromagnetic Deﬂection System
An  electromagnetic  deﬂection  coil  is  composed  of  two  perpendicular  windings  generating  electromagnetic
ﬁelds perpendicular to the trajectory of the electron beam in the vertical and horizontal planes. Figure 83.22
shows  the  principle  of  electromagnetic  deﬂection  where  a  ﬁeld  of  length  l  is  applied  perpendicularly  to  the
electron beam accelerated at VB. The beam, assuming the ﬁeld intensity is uniform and of length l, is deﬂected
onto a circular path of radius r. The corresponding angle of deﬂection is q such as:
