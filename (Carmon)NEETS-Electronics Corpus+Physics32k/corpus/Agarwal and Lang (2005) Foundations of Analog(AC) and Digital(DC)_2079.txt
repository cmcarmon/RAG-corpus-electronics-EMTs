(cid:1) Using Q as the common parameter, the time-domain step response of
a circuit can be visualized from the circuit’s frequency response, and vice
versa. For example, a ‘‘peaky’’ gain versus frequency plot implies ringing in
the step response, while the absence of peakiness implies a quick decay of
the step response.
