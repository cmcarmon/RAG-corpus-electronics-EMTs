If the test leads are open-circuited, no current flows in coil a. However, current flows internally
through coil b, and deflects the pointer to infinity, which indicates a resistance too large to measure.
When a resistance such as Rx is connected between the test leads, current also flows in coil a, tending to
move the pointer clockwise. At the same time, coil b still tends to move the pointer counterclockwise.
Therefore, the moving element, composed of both coils and the pointer, comes to rest in a position at
which the two forces are balanced. This position depends upon the value of the external resistance, which
controls the relative amount of current in coil a. Because changes in voltage affect both coil a and coil b
in the same proportion, the position of the moving system is independent of the voltage. If the test leads
are short-circuited, the pointer rests at zero because the current in coil a is relatively large. The instrument
is not damaged under these circumstances because the current is limited by R3.
