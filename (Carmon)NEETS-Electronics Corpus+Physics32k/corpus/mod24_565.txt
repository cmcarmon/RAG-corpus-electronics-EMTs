Point defects exhibiting gain in one direction will exhibit an exaggerated loss in the opposite
direction. Figure 5-17 shows the apparent loss shown by the OTDR for the same point defect shown in
figure 5-16 when measured in the opposite direction. Bidirectional measurements are conducted to cancel
the effects of backscatter coefficient variations. Bidirectional averaging combines the two values to
identify the true signal loss. Bidirectional averaging is possible only if test personnel have access to both
ends of the test sample.
