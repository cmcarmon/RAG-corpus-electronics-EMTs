The basic telemetry system consists of three building blocks. These are (1) input transducer, (2) the trans-
mitter, and (3) the receiving station. Transducers convert the measured physical quantity into a usable form
for transmission. The conversion of the desired information into a form capable of being transmitted to the
receiver  is  a  function  of  the  type  of  transducer  employed.  Transducers  convert  the  physical  quantities  to  be
