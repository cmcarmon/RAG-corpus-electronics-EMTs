Because a battery cannot produce an inÔ¨Ånite amount of current, a model for the behavior
of a battery is to put an internal resistance in series with an ideal voltage source (zero
resistance). Real-life EMFs can always be approximated with ideal EMFs and appropriate
combinations of other circuit elements.
