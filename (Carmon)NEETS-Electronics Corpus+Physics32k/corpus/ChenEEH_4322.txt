It is commonly known with real numbers that multiplication
distributes over addition, and both additive and multiplicative
inverses exist. In the case where a multiplicative inverse does
not exist, but properties 1 through 6 hold (such as with inte-
gers), then the set does not form a Ô¨Åeld but is categorized as a
commutative ring. If property 2 also does not hold, then the
correct terminology is a ring.
