where Ia is now the armature current input. Under steady-state conditions, volt–ampere charac-
teristic curves are of interest for dc generators, and speed–torque characteristics are of interest
for dc motors. Depending on the method of excitation of the ﬁeld windings, a wide variety of
operating characteristics can be obtained. These possibilities make the dc machine both versatile
and adaptable for control. More about dc machines is presented in Section 13.4.
