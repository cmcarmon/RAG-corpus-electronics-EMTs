During  decoding,  the  acoustic  models  to  be  used  for  a  given  observation  string  are  chosen  based  on  the
current acoustic context â€” that is, by pouring the data down the decision tree until a terminal node is reached
and using the models at that terminal node to compute the likelihood of the data.
