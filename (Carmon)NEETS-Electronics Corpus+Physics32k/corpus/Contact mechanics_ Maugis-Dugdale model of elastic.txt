Further improvement to the Tabor idea was provided by Maugis who represented the surface force in terms of a Dugdale cohesive zone approximation such that the work of adhesion is given by




Δ
γ
=

σ

0




h

0




{\displaystyle \Delta \gamma =\sigma _{0}~h_{0}}

where




σ

0




{\displaystyle \sigma _{0}}
is the maximum force predicted by the Lennard-Jones potential and




h

0




{\displaystyle h_{0}}
is the maximum separation obtained by matching the areas under the Dugdale and Lennard-Jones curves (see adjacent figure). This means that the attractive force is constant for




z

z

h

{\displaystyle z_{0}\leq z\leq z_{0}+h_{0}}
. There is not further penetration in compression. Perfect contact occurs in an area of radius



a


{\displaystyle a}
and adhesive forces of magnitude




σ

{\displaystyle \sigma _{0}}
extend to an area of radius



c

a


{\displaystyle c>a}
. In the region



a

{\displaystyle a<r<c}
, the two surfaces are separated by a distance



h

{\displaystyle h(r)}
with

{\displaystyle h(a)=0}
and



h

=

{\displaystyle h(c)=h_{0}}
. The ratio



m


{\displaystyle m}
is defined as




m
:=

{\displaystyle m:={\cfrac {c}{a}}}
.
In the Maugis-Dugdale theory, the surface traction distribution is divided into two parts - one due to the Hertz contact pressure and the other from the Dugdale adhesive stress. Hertz contact is assumed in the region

{\displaystyle -a<r<a}

In addition, Maugis proposed a parameter

{\displaystyle \lambda }

to match the Lennard-Jones potential, which leads to

This equation can be solved to obtain values of

{\displaystyle \lambda }
. For large values of

{\displaystyle \lambda }

the DMT model is retrieved.
