∼= 0.7 V, which is the threshold voltage VT. Supposing that RB is chosen so as to drive
where vBE
the transistor into saturation such that IB sat = 50 µA, the operating point switches to point ➁ on
the collector–emitter characteristic, when the transistor is said to be saturated, or simply on. In
this saturated state V CE sat = Vsat, which is typically 0.2 to 0.3 V, depending on iB. The collector
current in saturation is given by
