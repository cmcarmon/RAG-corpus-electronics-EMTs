The major advantage of this type modulation circuit over frequency modulation is that this circuit
uses a crystal-controlled oscillator to maintain a stable carrier frequency. In fm the oscillator cannot be
crystal controlled because it is actually required to vary in frequency. That means that an fm oscillator
will require a complex automatic frequency control (afc) system. An afc system ensures that the oscillator
stays on the same carrier frequency and achieves a high degree of stability. The afc circuit will be covered
in a later module.
