and the inductor voltage
Since at steady state, i is constant, 
v ⫽ 0.
When the switch suddenly opens, a large voltage is developed
across the inductor (due to the rapidly collapsing ﬁeld) causing a spark
or arc in the air gap. The spark continues until the energy stored in the
inductor is dissipated in the spark discharge. In laboratories, when one
is working with inductive circuits, this same effect causes a very nasty
shock, and one must exercise caution.
