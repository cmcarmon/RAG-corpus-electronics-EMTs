The popularity of disk storage devices is largely because of their direct-access capabilities. Most 
every system (micro, mini, and mainframe) will have disk capability. Magnetic disks resemble 
phonograph records (round platters), coated with a magnetizable recording material (iron oxide), but their 
similarities end there. Magnetic disks come in many different sizes and storage capacities. They range 
from 3 inches to 4 feet in diameter and can store from 2.5 million to 600 million characters (bytes) of 
data. They can be portable in that they are removable, or they can be permanently mounted in the storage 
devices called disk drive units or disk drives. They can be made of rigid metal (hard disks) or flexible 
plastic (floppy disks or diskettes) as shown in figure 2-6.
