A large variety of possible types of RAMs for use as main
memories has been proposed in the literature; research on
RAM technology is still very active, as demonstrated by the
results presented at International Solid-State Circuits (ISSCC)
and Custom Integrated Circuit (CICC) conferences. Summary
articles are available by Comerford and Watson (1992), Prince
(1994), Oshima et al. (1997), and Lawton (1999). The general
organization depends on the number of ports, but usually
single-port structures are encountered in the large density
memories. These structures will also be a restriction here.
Most other distinguishing characteristics are related to the
circuit design (and the technological issues) of the RAM cell,
the decoder, and the auxiliary R/W devices. In this subsection,
only the general principles are discussed.
