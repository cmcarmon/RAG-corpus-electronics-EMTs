These statements are cited from
1) Protons fuse
2) One proton is transmuted into one neutron forming Deuterium (releasing one positron and an electron-neutrino).
3) Deuterium fuses with another proton (which also releases gamma-rays)
4) Two of the resulting Helium_3 nuclei fuse
5) An Alpha particle (Helium_4) forms with the energetic release of two protons to complete the process.
A fun quote by Arthur Eddington:
"I am aware that many critics consider the stars are not hot enough. The critics lay themselves open to an obvious retort; we tell them to go and find a hotter place."
