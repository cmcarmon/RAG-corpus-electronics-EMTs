A common type of diode test set is a combination ohmmeter-ammeter. You can make measurements
of forward resistance, back resistance, and reverse current with this equipment. You can determine the
condition of the rectifier under test by comparing its actual values with typical values obtained from test
information furnished with the test set or from the manufacturer’s data sheets. Comparing the diode’s back
and forward resistance at a specified voltage provides you with a rough indication of the rectifying
property of a diode. A typical back-to-forward resistance ratio is on the order of 10 to 1, and a forward-
resistance value of 50 to 80 ohms is common.
