In a single dwell Cam mechanism, there are three motion functions that follow each other and then repeat: a dwell, a rise, and a return function. It is sometimes desired to use a Rise function such that its acceleration does not become zero at its end. To maintain continuity of acceleration, the return function should begin with a same non-zero acceleration that matches the end of the rise function. There are a number of functions that can provide these motion requirements. A double-harmonic function is a common example used for single dwell.
