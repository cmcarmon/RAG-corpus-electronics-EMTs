A string of symbols representing the phonemes is called
phonemic transcription. When the transcription also includes
diacritical marks on the phonemic symbols that indicate
allophonic variations, then the result is a phonetic transcrip-
tion. Although the term phonetic transcription is commonly
used, speech processing engineers tend to think about speech
more at the level of phonemic transcriptions even though
allophonic variations are inherently modeled in many systems.
