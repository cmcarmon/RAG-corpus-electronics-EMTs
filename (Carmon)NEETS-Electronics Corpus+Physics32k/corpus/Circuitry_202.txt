Z
where Z is the impedance of the circuit (in ohms), 
and  XL and  XC are  the  reactances  of  the  inductor 
and  capacitor  respectively  (both  expressed 
in 
ohms). 
  The phase angle (between the supply voltage and 
current) will be +0/2 rad (i.e. +90°) when XL > XC
(above resonance) or @0/2 rad (or @90°) when XC >
XL (below resonance). 
  At  a  particular  frequency  (known  as  the  series 
resonant frequency) the reactance of the capacitor, 
XC, will  be  equal  in  magnitude  (but  of  opposite 
sign)  to  that  of  the  inductor,  XL. Due  to  this 
effective  cancellation  of 
the 
impedance  of  the  series  resonant  circuit  will  be 
zero  at  resonance.  The  supply  current  will  have  a 
maximum value at resonance (infinite in the case of 
a perfect  series  resonant  circuit  supplied  from  an 
ideal voltage source!). 
  The impedance of the parallel circuit in Fig. 4.14
