d > Aa, as the rotor angle decelerates past upost
from time t ¼ t1, the deceleration area will become equal to
the accelaration area at some intermediate value of u between
at some time of t ¼ t2. For time t > t2, the
upost
s
speed v falls below vs, and the rotor angle u starts to decrease
back toward upost
. The alternating scenarios of rotor angle
acceleration and deceleration will continue before the angle
swings are damped out eventually by the rotor damping effects
that have been ignored thus far. Therefore, we say that the
system is transient stable whenever Amax
