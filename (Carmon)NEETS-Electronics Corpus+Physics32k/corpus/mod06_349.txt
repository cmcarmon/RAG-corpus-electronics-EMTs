Generally, when gas-filled tubes are in the state of ionization, they are illuminated internally by a
soft, blue glow. This glow is brightest in the space between the electrodes and of lesser intensity
throughout the remainder of the tube envelope. This glow is normal and must not be confused with the
glow present in high-vacuum tubes when gases are present. A high-vacuum tube with a bluish glow is
gassy and should be replaced. The ionization of these gases will distort the output of the tube and may
cause the tube to operate with much higher plate current than it can carry safely.
