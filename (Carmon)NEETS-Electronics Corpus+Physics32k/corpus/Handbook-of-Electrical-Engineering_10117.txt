Gantry Conﬁguration
The gantry conﬁguration is geometrically equiva-
lent  to  the  Cartesian  conﬁguration,  but  is  sus-
pended from an overhead crane and typically can
be  moved  over  a  large  workspace.  It  consists  of
three  linear  joints  (PPP),  and  is  illustrated  in
Fig. 101.11. In terms of work envelope, it will have
a rectangular volume that sweeps out most of the
inner area of the gantry system, with a height lim-
ited  by  the  length  of  the  vertical  mast,  and  the
headroom above the gantry system. One consid-
eration  in  the  selection  of  a  gantry  robot  is  the
z
 axis. A
type of vertical linkage employed in the 
monomast  design  is  more  rigid,  yielding  tighter
tolerances  for  repeatability  and  accuracy,  but
requires signiﬁcant headroom above the gantry to
z
 axis motion. On the other
have a large range of 
hand,  a  telescoping  linkage  will  require  signiﬁ-
cantly less headroom but is less rigid, with corre-
sponding reduction in repeatability and accuracy.
Other  robot  conﬁgurations  can  be  mounted  on
gantry systems, thus gaining many of the advan-
tages of this geometry.
