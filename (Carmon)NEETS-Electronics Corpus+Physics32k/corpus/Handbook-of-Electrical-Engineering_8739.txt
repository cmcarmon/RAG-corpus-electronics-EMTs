One of the reasons procedural HLLs fail to fully hide all details of an abstraction is that they typically have weak
models of data. Data is allowed to ﬂow across many boundaries, which leads to problems with encapsulation. In
FORTRAN, BASIC, Pascal, and C, for example, access to any data is given freely through globals, parameter passing,
and ﬁles. This is called coupling and can have disastrous implications if not carefully controlled.
