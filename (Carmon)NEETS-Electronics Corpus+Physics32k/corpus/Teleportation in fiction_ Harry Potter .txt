In the Harry Potter book series by J. K. Rowling, there are several methods of teleportation, all of them magical. Apparation and Disapparation allow the wizard to disappear in one location and appear in another location. If the wizard is not sufficiently skilled, he can splinch himself, meaning to leave part of himself behind. A skilled wizard can also take somebody with him while apparating. Because of the risk associated with apparation, a wizard must be of age and licensed in order to apparate; however, many wizards choose not to, as it is very dangerous. Unlicensed, untalented or unwilling wizards can use Floo powder, dust that is sprinkled over a fireplace enabling a connection to another fireplace, and Portkeys, enchanted objects that transport themselves and anyone holding them to a predetermined place at a predetermined time.
