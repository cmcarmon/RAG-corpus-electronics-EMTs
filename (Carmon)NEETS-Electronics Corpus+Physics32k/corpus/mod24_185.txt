If the size of the defect is greater than one-tenth of the wavelength of light, the scattering mechanism
is called Mie scattering. Mie scattering, caused by these large defects in the fiber core, scatters light out of
the fiber core. However, in commercial fibers, the effects of Mie scattering are insignificant. Optical
fibers are manufactured with very few large defects.
