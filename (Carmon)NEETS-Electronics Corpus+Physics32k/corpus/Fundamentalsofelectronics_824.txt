From our work in Fourier series, we know that this signal’s spectrum contains odd-harmonics of the
fundamental, which here equals 1
. Thus, strictly speaking, the signal’s bandwidth is inﬁnite. In practical
2T
terms, we use the 90%-power bandwidth to assess the eﬀective range of frequencies consumed by the signal.
The ﬁrst and third harmonics contain that fraction of the total power, meaning that the eﬀective bandwidth
of our baseband signal is 3
. Thus, a digital
2T
communications signal requires more bandwidth than the datarate: a 1 Mbps baseband system requires a
bandwidth of at least 1.5 MHz. Listen carefully when someone describes the transmission bandwidth of
digital communication systems: Did they say “megabits” or “megahertz?”
