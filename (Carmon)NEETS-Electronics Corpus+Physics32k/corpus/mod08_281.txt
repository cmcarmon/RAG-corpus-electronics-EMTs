As in chapter 2, the circuits shown in this chapter are intended to present particular concepts to you.
Therefore, the circuits may be incomplete or not practical for use in an actual piece of electronic
equipment. You should keep in mind the fact that this text is intended to teach certain facts about
amplifiers, and in order to simplify the illustrations used, complete operational circuits are not always
shown.
