One of the most important and familiar results of relativity is that the relativistic mass of the electron increases by





m

r
e
l


=



m

1
−
(

v

/

c

)

2







{\displaystyle m_{rel}={\frac {m_{e}}{\sqrt {1-(v_{e}/c)^{2}}}}}

where





m

e


,

v

e

c



{\displaystyle \displaystyle m_{e},v_{e},c}
are the electron rest mass, velocity of the electron, and speed of light respectively. The figure at the right illustrates the relativistic effects on the mass of an electron as a function of its velocity.
This has an immediate implication on the Bohr radius (





a

0





{\displaystyle \displaystyle a_{0}}
) which is given by





a

0


=


ℏ


m

e


c
α





{\displaystyle a_{0}={\frac {\hbar }{m_{e}c\alpha }}}

where



ℏ


{\displaystyle \hbar }
is the reduced Planck's constant and α is the fine-structure constant (a relativistic correction for the Bohr model).
Arnold Sommerfeld calculated that, for a 1s electron of a hydrogen atom with an orbiting radius of 0.0529 nm, α ≈ 1/137. That is to say, the fine-structure constant shows the electron traveling at nearly 1/137 the speed of light. One can extend this to a larger element by using the expression v ≈ Zc/137 for a 1s electron where v is its radial velocity. For gold with (Z = 79) the 1s electron will be going (α = 0.58c) 58% of the speed of light. Plugging this in for v/c for the relativistic mass one finds that mrel = 1.22me and in turn putting this in for the Bohr radius above one finds that the radius shrinks by 22%.
If one substitutes in the relativistic mass into the equation for the Bohr radius it can be written





a

m

{\displaystyle a_{rel}={\frac {\hbar {\sqrt {1-(v_{e}/c)^{2}}}}{m_{e}c\alpha }}}


It follows that

{\displaystyle {\frac {a_{rel}}{a_{0}}}={\sqrt {1-(v_{e}/c)^{2}}}}

At right, the above ratio of the relativistic and nonrelativistic Bohr radii has been plotted as a function of the electron velocity. Notice how the relativistic model shows the radius decreasing with increasing velocity.
When the Bohr treatment is extended to hydrogenic-like atoms using the Quantum Rule, the Bohr radius becomes

{\displaystyle r={\frac {n^{2}\hbar ^{2}4\pi \epsilon _{0}}{m_{e}Ze^{2}}}}

where



n


{\displaystyle n}
is the principal quantum number and Z is an integer for the atomic number. From quantum mechanics the angular momentum is given as



m

v

e


r

{\displaystyle mv_{e}r=n\hbar }
. Substituting into the equation above and solving for

{\displaystyle v}
gives

{\displaystyle v_{e}={\frac {Ze^{2}}{n\hbar 4\pi \epsilon _{0}}}}

From this point atomic units can be used to simplify the expression into





v

e


=


Z
n




{\displaystyle v_{e}={\frac {Z}{n}}}

Substituting this into the expression for the Bohr ratio mentioned above gives

(

)


2






{\displaystyle {\frac {a_{rel}}{a_{0}}}={\sqrt {1-\left({\frac {Z}{nc}}\right)^{2}}}}

At this point one can see that for a low value of



n


{\displaystyle n}
and a high value of



Z


{\displaystyle Z}
that

{\displaystyle {\frac {a_{rel}}{a_{0}}}<1}
. This fits with intuition: electrons with lower principal quantum numbers will have a higher probability density of being nearer to the nucleus. A nucleus with a large charge will cause an electron to have a high velocity. A higher electron velocity means an increased electron relativistic mass, as a result the electrons will be near the nucleus more of the time and thereby contract the radius for small principal quantum numbers.
