state-space models. Several packages of tools for state-space design were created and reached maturity in the
late 1970s. These packages were usually written in FORTRAN and made use of a question-and-answer interface.
Some of the better packages made use of standard numerical libraries such as EISPACK and LINPACK, but
many made use of home-grown algorithms with sometimes dubious numerical properties.
