In the past, information processing systems migrated from
computing centers via desktops and laptops into embedded
systems, which are a well-hidden part of not only transporta-
tion or production systems but even of devices for entertain-
ment and leisure usage. These embedded systems derive their
functionality from a cooperation of components that operate
either time-continuously or event-discretely. In addition,
embedded systems are products from different engineering
disciplines, such as mechanical, electrical, and computer en-
gineering. Examples of such systems are not only robots or
automotive engine control units, for instance, and can be part
of a scuba diverâ€™s equipment, as will be shown subsequently.
