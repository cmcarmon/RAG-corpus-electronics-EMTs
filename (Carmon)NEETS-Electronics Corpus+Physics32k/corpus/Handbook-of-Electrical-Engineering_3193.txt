Single-Ended Resonant Converters. They are referred to as quasi-resonant converters (QRCs) since the voltage
(or  current)  waveforms  are  quasi-sinusoidal  in  nature.  The  QRCs  can  operate  with  zero-current  switching
(ZCS) or ZVS or both. All the QRC conﬁgurations can be generated by replacing the conventional switches by
the resonant switches shown in Figs. 30.28 and 30.29. A number of conﬁgurations are realizable. Basic principles
of ZCS and ZVS are explained brieﬂy below.
