1602 – Galileo Galilei conducts experiments on pendulum motion.
1604 – Galileo Galilei conducts experiments with inclined planes and induces the law of falling objects.
1607 – Galileo Galilei arrives a mathematical formulation of the law of falling objects based on his earlier experiments.
1608 – Galileo Galilei discovers the parabolic arc of projectiles through experiment.
1609 – Johannes Kepler describes the motion of planets around the Sun, now known as Kepler's laws of planetary motion.
1640 – Ismaël Bullialdus suggests an inverse-square gravitational force law.
1665 – Isaac Newton introduces an inverse-square universal law of gravitation uniting terrestrial and celestial theories of motion and uses it to predict the orbit of the Moon and the parabolic arc of projectiles.
1684 – Isaac Newton proves that planets moving under an inverse-square force law will obey Kepler's laws
1686 – Isaac Newton uses a fixed length pendulum with weights of varying composition to test the weak equivalence principle to 1 part in 1000
