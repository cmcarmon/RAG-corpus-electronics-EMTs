The circuit in Figure 1.4 was proposed to model the original circuit, and
to help determine such quantities as the current flowing through the lightbulb
and the power dissipated in it. In this case, the signal representations in the
lumped-parameter circuit were chosen naturally. The quantities of interest in
the physical circuit, namely its voltages and currents, were represented by the
same voltages and currents in the circuit model. This is an example of native
signal representation.
