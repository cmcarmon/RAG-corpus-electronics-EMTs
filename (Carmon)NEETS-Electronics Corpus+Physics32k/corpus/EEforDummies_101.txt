Imagine applying a constant electric current to a pair of speakers without 
using anything to control, or “shape,” the current. What would you hear? 
Guaranteed it wouldn’t be music! By using the proper combination of 
electronics assembled in just the right way, you can control the way each 
speaker diaphragm vibrates, producing recognizable sounds such as speech 
or music. There’s so much more you can do with electric current when you 
know how to control the flow of electrons.
