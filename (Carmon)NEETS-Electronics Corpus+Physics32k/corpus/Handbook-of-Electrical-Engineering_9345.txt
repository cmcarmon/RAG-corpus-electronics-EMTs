Computer graphics encompasses a wide variety of applications. It has expanded its scope from the mundane
business/presentation graphics to placing desktop publishing at everyone’s ﬁngertips. Highly interactive real-
time systems are used in ﬂight simulators where the display represents changes in the scene or landscape. In
engineering, computer-aided design (CAD) systems allow users to create, store, manipulate, and test objects
and  designs.  Fully  integrated  systems  allow  standard  component  parts  libraries  to  be  incorporated  into  a
product. Product design and drafting information is fed into manufacturing operations via numerical control
interfaces. Other engineering applications that make extensive use of graphics include very large scale integration
(VLSI) and solid modeling.
