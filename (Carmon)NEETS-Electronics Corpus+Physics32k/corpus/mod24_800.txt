RZ coding uses only half the bit duration for data transmission. In RZ encoding, a half period optical
pulse present in the first half of the bit duration represents a binary 1. While an optical pulse is present in
the first half of the bit duration, the light level returns to zero during the second half. A binary 0 is
represented by the absence of an optical pulse during the entire bit duration. Because RZ coding uses only
half the bit duration for data transmission, it requires twice the bandwidth of NRZ coding. Loss of timing
can occur if long strings of 0s are present.
