The cells in an automotive battery are contained within the same hard rubber housing,
connected together with thick, lead bars instead of wires. The electrodes and electrolyte solu-
tions for each cell are contained in separate, partitioned sections of the battery case. In large
batteries, the electrodes commonly take the shape of thin metal grids or plates, and are often
referred to as plates instead of electrodes.
