Apparently when the grid voltage reached +12 volts at time e, the plate current reached saturation.
Maximum plate current (at saturation) results in maximum voltage across RL and minimum plate voltage.
Any grid voltage higher than +12 volts cannot cause further changes in the output. Therefore, between
time e and time f, the plate voltage remains at +100 volts and the waveform is distorted. This is also
AMPLITUDE DISTORTION.
