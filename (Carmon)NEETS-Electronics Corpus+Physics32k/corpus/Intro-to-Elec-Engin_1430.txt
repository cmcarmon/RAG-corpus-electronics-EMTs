Commercial television broadcasting is allocated frequencies that fall in the VHF and UHF
bands. Table 15.2.1 lists the television channel allocations in the United States, with the channel
bandwidth of 6 MHz. In contrast to radio broadcasting, television signal-transmission standards
vary from country to country. The U.S. standard is set by the National Television Systems Com-
mittee (NTSC). Commercial television broadcasting began as black-and-white (monochrome)
picture transmission in London in 1936 by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). Although
color television was demonstrated a few years later, due to the high cost of color television
receivers, color television signal transmission was slow in its development. With the advent of
the transistor and microelectronic components, the cost of color television receivers decreased
signiÔ¨Åcantly, and by the middle 1960s, color television broadcasting was widely used by the
industry. The NTSC color system is compatible with monochrome receivers, so that the older
monochrome receivers still function receiving black-and-white images out of the transmitted
color signal.
