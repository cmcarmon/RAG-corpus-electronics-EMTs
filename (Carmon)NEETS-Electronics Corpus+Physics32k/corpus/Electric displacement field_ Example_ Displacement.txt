Consider an infinite parallel plate capacitor placed in space (or in a medium) with no free charges present except on the capacitor. In SI units, the charge density on the plates is equal to the value of the D field between the plates. This follows directly from Gauss's law, by integrating over a small rectangular box straddling one plate of the capacitor:

{\displaystyle \oint _{A}\mathbf {D} \cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {A} =Q_{\text{free}}}

On the sides of the box, dA is perpendicular to the field, so the integral over this section is zero. For the space inside the capacitor where the fields of the two plates add,

A




{\displaystyle |\mathbf {D} |={\frac {Q_{\text{free}}}{A}}}
,
where A is surface area of the top face of the box and Qfree / A is the free surface charge density on the positive plate. Outside the capacitor, the fields of the two plates cancel each other and |E| = |D| = 0. If the space between the capacitor plates is filled with a linear homogeneous isotropic dielectric with permittivity ε, and the charge Qfree is kept constant, the total electric field E between the plates will be smaller than D by a factor of ε: |E| = Qfree / (εA). Alternatively, if the voltage and E are kept constant, the stored charges will increase by a factor of ε.
If the distance d between the plates of a finite parallel plate capacitor is much smaller than its lateral dimensions we can approximate it using the infinite case and obtain its capacitance as

{\displaystyle C={\frac {Q_{\text{free}}}{V}}\approx {\frac {Q_{\text{free}}}{|\mathbf {E} |d}}={\frac {A}{d}}\varepsilon ,}

where V is the potential difference sustained between the two plates. The partial cancellation of fields in the dielectric allows a larger amount of free charge to dwell on the two plates of the capacitor per unit potential drop than would be possible if the plates were separated by vacuum.
