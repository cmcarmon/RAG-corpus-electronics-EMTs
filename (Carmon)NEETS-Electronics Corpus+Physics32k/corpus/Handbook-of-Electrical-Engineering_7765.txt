The magnetic tape reel is usually 1‚ÅÑ2 inch or 1 inch wide and has lengths of 600, 1200, and 2400 feet. Most
reels can store data at rates from 800 bits per inch (bpi) up to 6250 bpi. The reel-to-reel magnetic tape reader
is  generally  bulkier  and  more  expensive  than  the  cartridge  readers  due  to  the  complicated  pneumatic  drive
mechanisms, but it provides a large data storage capacity with high access speeds [Wiehler, 1974]. An example
of a typical magnetic tape drive with the reel-to-reel arrangement is shown in Fig. 80.16.
