Core GGH (or CPM) algorithm which defines the evolution of the cellular level structures can easily be integrated with intracellular signaling dynamics, reaction diffusion dynamics and rule based model to account for the processes which happen at lower (or higher) time scale. Open source software Bionetsolver can be used to integrate intracellular dynamics with CPM algorithm.
