Arbitrary Wire Antennas
An arbitrary wire antenna can be considered as a sum of small current dipole elements. The vector potential
for each of these elements can be determined in the same way as for the short dipole. The total vector potential
is then the sum over all these inﬁnitesimal contributions and the resulting E in the far ﬁeld can be found to be
