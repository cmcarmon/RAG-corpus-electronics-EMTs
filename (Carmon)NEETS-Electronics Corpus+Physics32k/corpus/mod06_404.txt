Radioactive material is added to a tube to aid in ionization. The radioactive material emits relatively
slowly moving particles. This should not worry you because the glass envelope is thick enough to keep
these particles inside the tube. Therefore, proper handling is nothing more than ensuring that the envelope
remains unbroken. If these tubes are broken and the radioactive material is exposed, or escapes from the
confines of the electron tube, the radioactive material becomes a potential hazard.
