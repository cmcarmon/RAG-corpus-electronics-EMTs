You may also see the symbol for signal ground used to represent a zero‐volt 
reference point for signals (information‐carrying waveforms) carried by two 
wires. One wire is connected to this reference point and the other wire car-
ries a varying voltage representing the signal. Again, in many schematics, the 
symbol for earth ground is used instead.
