Fiber-Optic-Based Sensors
The  ﬁeld  of  sensing  technology  has  been  revolutionized  in  the  past  decade  by  the  entry  of  ﬁber  optics.  The
properties  of  ﬁber  optics  that  have  made  the  technology  suitable  for  communications  are  responsible  for  it
being successful as a sensor as well. Fiber-optic sensors are of two types, namely, extrinsic and intrinsic. In the
extrinsic type, the ﬁber itself acts only as a transmitter and does no part of the sensing. In an intrinsic type,
however,  the  ﬁber  acts  as  a  sensor  by  using  one  of  its  intrinsic  properties,  such  as  induced  birefringence  or
electrochromatism, to detect a phenomenon or quantify a measurement. Relevant to smart systems, the use of
ﬁber optics in conjunction with optical (sensors) is based on changes in optical effects such as refractive index,
optical absorption, luminescence, and chromic properties due to alterations in the environment in which the
ﬁber is imbedded. Such alterations refer to strain or other elastic characteristics and thermal and/or electro-
magnetic properties [Claus, 1991]. Surfaces located with smart ﬁber sensors are known as smart skins.
