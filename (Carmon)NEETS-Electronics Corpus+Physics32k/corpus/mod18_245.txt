The two types of modulators are the LINE-PULSING MODULATOR and the HARD-TUBE
MODULATOR. (A hard tube is a high-vacuum electron tube.) The line-pulsing modulator stores energy
and forms pulses in the same circuit element. This element is usually the pulse-forming network. The
hard-tube modulator forms the pulse in the driver; the pulse is then amplified and applied to the
modulator. The hard tube modulator has been replaced by the line-pulsed modulator in most cases. This is
because the hard-tube modulator has lower efficiency, its circuits are more complex, a higher power
supply voltage is required, and it is more sensitive to voltage changes.
