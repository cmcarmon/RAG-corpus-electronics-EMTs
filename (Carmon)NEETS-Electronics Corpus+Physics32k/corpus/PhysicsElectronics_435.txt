The circuits we have encountered so far are passive and dissipate power. Even a transformer
that is capable of giving a voltage gain to a circuit is not an active element. Active elements
in a circuit increase the power by controlling or modulating the ï¬‚ow of energy or power from
an additional power supply into the circuit.
