There are many different ways in which video amplifiers can be built. The particular configuration of
a video amplifier depends upon the equipment in which the video amplifier is used. The circuit shown in
figure 2-10 is only one of many possible video-amplifier circuits. Rather than reading about what each
component does in this circuit, you can see how well you have learned about video amplifiers by
answering the following questions. You should have no problem identifying the purpose of the
components because similar circuits have been explained to you earlier in the text.
