Both the limiter and quadrature grids must be positive at the same time to have plate current. You
can see how much conduction time occurs for each cycle of the input by overlaying the current
waveforms in views (B) and  (D), as shown in view (E). The times when both grids are positive are
shown by the shaded area of view (E). These plate current pulses are shown for operation at resonance in
view (F).
