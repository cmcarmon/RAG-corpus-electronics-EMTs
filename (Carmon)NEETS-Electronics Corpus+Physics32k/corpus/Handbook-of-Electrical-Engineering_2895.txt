Other  problems  that  may  contribute  to  defective  solder  joints
include poor solder mask adhesion, and unequal solder land areas
at opposite ends of passive parts, which creates unequal moments
as the paste liquiﬁes and develops surface tension. Wrong solder
paste volumes, whether too much or too little, will create defects,
as will board shake in placement machines and coplanarity prob-
lems in IC components. Many of these problems should be covered
and compensated for during the design process and the qualiﬁca-
tion of SMT production equipment.
