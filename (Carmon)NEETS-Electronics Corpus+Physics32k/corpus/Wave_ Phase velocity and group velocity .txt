There are two velocities that are associated with waves, the phase velocity and the group velocity. To understand them, one must consider several types of waveform. For simplification, examination is restricted to one dimension.

The most basic wave (a form of plane wave) may be expressed in the form:




ψ
(
x
,
t
)
=
A

e

i

(

k
x
−
ω
t

)




,


{\displaystyle \psi (x,t)=Ae^{i\left(kx-\omega t\right)}\ ,}

which can be related to the usual sine and cosine forms using Euler's formula. Rewriting the argument,



k

=

(
x

v
t
)


{\displaystyle kx-\omega t=\left({\frac {2\pi }{\lambda }}\right)(x-vt)}
, makes clear that this expression describes a vibration of wavelength

{\displaystyle \lambda ={\frac {2\pi }{k}}}
traveling in the x-direction with a constant phase velocity

{\displaystyle v_{p}={\frac {\omega }{k}}\,}
.
The other type of wave to be considered is one with localized structure described by an envelope, which may be expressed mathematically as, for example:




ψ

,


{\displaystyle \psi (x,t)=\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }\ dk_{1}\ A(k_{1})\ e^{i\left(k_{1}x-\omega t\right)}\ ,}

where now A(k1) (the integral is the inverse Fourier transform of A(k1)) is a function exhibiting a sharp peak in a region of wave vectors Δk surrounding the point k1 = k. In exponential form:




A

,


{\displaystyle A=A_{o}(k_{1})e^{i\alpha (k_{1})}\ ,}

with Ao the magnitude of A. For example, a common choice for Ao is a Gaussian wave packet:

,


{\displaystyle A_{o}(k_{1})=N\ e^{-\sigma ^{2}(k_{1}-k)^{2}/2}\ ,}

where σ determines the spread of k1-values about k, and N is the amplitude of the wave.
The exponential function inside the integral for ψ oscillates rapidly with its argument, say φ(k1), and where it varies rapidly, the exponentials cancel each other out, interfere destructively, contributing little to ψ. However, an exception occurs at the location where the argument φ of the exponential varies slowly. (This observation is the basis for the method of stationary phase for evaluation of such integrals.) The condition for φ to vary slowly is that its rate of change with k1 be small; this rate of variation is:

{\displaystyle \left.{\frac {d\varphi }{dk_{1}}}\right|_{k_{1}=k}=x-t\left.{\frac {d\omega }{dk_{1}}}\right|_{k_{1}=k}+\left.{\frac {d\alpha }{dk_{1}}}\right|_{k_{1}=k}\ ,}

where the evaluation is made at k1 = k because A(k1) is centered there. This result shows that the position x where the phase changes slowly, the position where ψ is appreciable, moves with time at a speed called the group velocity:





v

g


=



d
ω


d
k




.


{\displaystyle v_{g}={\frac {d\omega }{dk}}\ .}

The group velocity therefore depends upon the dispersion relation connecting ω and k. For example, in quantum mechanics the energy of a particle represented as a wave packet is E = ħω = (ħk)2/(2m). Consequently, for that wave situation, the group velocity is





v

g


=



ℏ
k

m



,


{\displaystyle v_{g}={\frac {\hbar k}{m}}\ ,}

showing that the velocity of a localized particle in quantum mechanics is its group velocity. Because the group velocity varies with k, the shape of the wave packet broadens with time, and the particle becomes less localized. In other words, the velocity of the constituent waves of the wave packet travel at a rate that varies with their wavelength, so some move faster than others, and they cannot maintain the same interference pattern as the wave propagates.
