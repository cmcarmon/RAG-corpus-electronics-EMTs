In the circuit shown, the negative terminal of the 
voltage source is connected to the N-type material. 
This forces electrons away from the terminal, toward 
the Pâ€“N junction. The free electrons that accumulate 
on the P side of the junction are attracted by the posi-
tive terminal. This action cancels the negative charge 
on the P side; the barrier voltage is eliminated, and a 
current is able to flow. Current flow occurs only if the 
external voltage is greater than the barrier voltage.
