Power factor (PF): The ratio of effective series resistance to impedance of a capacitor, expressed as a percentage.
Quality factor (Q): The ratio of the reactance to its equivalent series resistance.
Reactance  (X): Opposition  to  the  ï¬‚ow  of  alternating  current.  Capacitive  reactance  (Xc)  is  the  opposition
