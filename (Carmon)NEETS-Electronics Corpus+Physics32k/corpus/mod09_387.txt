The one-shot multivibrator has now been turned on by applying a pulse at the input. It will turn itself 
off after a period of time. To see how it does this, look at figure 3-13 again. Q1 is held in saturation by the 
negative voltage applied through R3 to its base, so the circuit cannot be turned off here. Notice that the 
base of Q2 is connected to C1. The positive charge on C1 keeps Q2 cutoff. Remember that a positive 
voltage change (essentially a pulse) was coupled from the collector of Q1 when it began conducting to the 
base of Q2, placing Q2 in cutoff. When the collector of Q1 switches from -VCC volts to 0 volts, the charge 
on C1 acts like a battery with its negative terminal on the collector of Q1, and its positive terminal 
connected to the base of Q2. This voltage is what cuts off Q2. C1 will now begin to discharge through Q1 
to ground, back through âˆ’VCC, through R2 to the other side of C1. The time required for C1 to discharge 
depends on the RC time constant of C1 and R2. Figure 3-14 is a timing diagram that shows the negative 
input pulse and the resultant waveforms that you would expect to see for this circuit description.
