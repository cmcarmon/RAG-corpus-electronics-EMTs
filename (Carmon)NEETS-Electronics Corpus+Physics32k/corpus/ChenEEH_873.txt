ures 4.6(A) and 4.6(B), the permissible ranges of the clock
skew for both local data paths, R1?R2 and R2?R3, are lightly
shaded under each circuit diagram. As shown in Figure 4.6, the
target clock period for this circuit is TCP ¼ 8:5 ns.
The zero clock skew points (skew ¼ 0) are indicated in
Figure 4.6(A)—zero skew is achieved by delivering the clock
signal to each of the registers R1, R2 and R3 with the same
delay t (symbolically illustrated by the buffers connected to the
clock terminals of the registers). Observe that while the zero
clock skew points fall within the respective permissible ranges,
these zero clock skew points are dangerously close to the lower
and upper bounds of the permissible range for R1?R2 and
R2?R3, respectively. A situation could be foreseen in which,
for example, the local data path R2?R3 has a longer than
expected delay (longer than 8 ns), thereby causing the upper
bound of the permissible range for R2?R3 to decrease below
the zero clock skew point. In this scenario, a setup violation
will occur on the local data path R2?R3.
