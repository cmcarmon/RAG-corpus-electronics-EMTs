Another  application  for  biomedical  sensors  is  in  patient  monitoring.  Sensors  represent  the  front  end  of
critical care monitors used in the intensive care unit and in the operating and recovery rooms. Measurements
cover a wide range of biomedical variables such as continuous recordings of blood pressure and transcutaneous
measurement of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the blood. The performance of these instruments is
strongly dependent on biomedical sensors. Patient monitoring can also be carried out in the various clinical
units  of  the  hospital.  Devices  such  as  ambulatory  cardiac  monitors  that  allow  patients  to  be  observed  while
they are free to move around if they desire are becoming important in clinical care in “step-down” units for
patients who have completed their stay in the intensive care unit. Patient monitoring has even made its way
into the home. Home cardiorespiratory monitors are thought to have some potential value in identifying infants
at risk of sudden infant death.
