A decrease in collector current allows the magnetic field of L1 to collapse. The collapsing field of L1 
induces a negative voltage into the secondary which is coupled through C2 and makes the base of Q1 
more negative. This, again, is regenerative action; it continues until Q1 is driven into cutoff.
