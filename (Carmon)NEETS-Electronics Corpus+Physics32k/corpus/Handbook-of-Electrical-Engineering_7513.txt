IC Logic Families and Subfamilies
The integrated circuit logic families actually consist of several subfamilies of ICs that differ in various perfor-
mance characteristics. The TTL logic family has been the most widely used family type for applications that
employ  small-scale  integration  (SSI)  or  medium-scale  integration  (MSI)  integrated  circuits.  Lower  power
consumption and higher levels of integration are the principal advantages of the CMOS family. The ECL family
is  generally  used  in  applications  that  require  high-speed  switching  logic.  Today,  the  most  common  device
numbering system used in the TTL and CMOS families has a preﬁx of 54 (generally used in military applications
(cid:176)
C) and 74 (generally used in industrial/commercial
and having an operating temperature range of –55 to 125
(cid:176)
C). Table 79.2 identiﬁes various logic families
applications and having an operating temperature range of 0 to 70
and subfamilies.
