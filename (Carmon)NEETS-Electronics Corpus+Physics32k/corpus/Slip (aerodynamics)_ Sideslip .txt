The sideslip also uses aileron and opposite rudder. In this case it is entered by lowering a wing and applying exactly enough opposite rudder so the airplane does not turn (maintaining the same heading), while maintaining safe airspeed with pitch or power. Compared to Forward-slip, less rudder is used: just enough to stop the change in the heading.
In the sideslip condition, the airplane's longitudinal axis remains parallel to the original flightpath, but the airplane no longer flies straight along its original track. Now, the horizontal component of lift forces the airplane to move sideways toward the low wing. This is the still-air, headwind or tailwind scenario. In case of crosswind, if the wing is lowered into the wind, the wind may push the airplane downwind and airplane may fly the original track. This is the sideslip approach technique used by many pilots in crosswind conditions [sideslip without slipping]. Other method is the crab-technique in which nose is pointed into the wind and the resulting drift keeps the airplane on the desired track. Wings are maintained level all the time.
A sideslip may be used exclusively to remain lined up with a runway centerline while on approach in a crosswind or be employed in the final moments of a crosswind landing. To commence sideslipping, the pilot rolls the airplane toward the wind to maintain runway centerline position while maintaining heading on the centerline with the rudder. Sideslip causes one main landing gear to touch down first, followed by the second main gear. This allows the wheels to be constantly aligned with the track, thus avoiding any side load at touchdown.
The sideslip method for crosswind landings is not suitable for long-winged and low-sitting aircraft such as gliders, where instead a crab angle (heading into the wind) is maintained until a moment before touchdown.
Aircraft manufacturer Airbus recommends sideslip approach only in low crosswind conditions.
