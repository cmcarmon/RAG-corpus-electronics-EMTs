Occasionally, the trace will actually be located off the CRT (up or down or to the left or right)
because of the orientation of the deflection plates. When pushed, the BEAM FINDER (figure 6-16) pulls
the beam onto the screen so that you can use the horizontal and vertical POSITION controls to center the
spot.
