Klystrode: An  ampliﬁer  device  for  UHF-TV  signals  that  combines  aspects  of  a  tetrode  (grid  modulation)
with a klystron (velocity modulation of an electron beam). The result is a more efﬁcient, less expensive
device for many applications. (Klystrode is a trademark of EIMAC, a division of Varian Associates.) The
term Inductive Output Tube (IOT) is a generic name for this class of device.
