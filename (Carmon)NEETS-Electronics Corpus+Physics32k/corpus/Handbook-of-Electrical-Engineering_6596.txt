A token-ring architecture is not especially attractive for a high-speed optical network (where S ~ B is above
1 Gb/s) because of the cost of high-speed repeater optoelectronics at each station and the packet-processing
delay. In addition, at high bit rates, the packet time may be much shorter than the propagation time around
the  ring,  unless  a  packet  contains  an  impractically  large  number  of  bits.  EfÔ¨Åcient  use  of  the  ring  with  short
packets may call for multiple tokens, which can lead to complex protocols. Increasing the number of bits per
packet increases the packet time but places added burden on the high-speed buffer at each station.
