pulses of amplitude A are 0 and A, whereas those associated with polar pulses (of amplitudes ±A)
are A and −A. It is, of course, better for the receiver if the ratio of the pulse-caused voltage to the
noise rms voltage is the largest possible at the time of measurement. Figure 15.3.8 shows PCM
reconstruction circuits for unipolar, polar, and Manchester waveforms. The following notation is
used:
