The advantages of radial tires over bias ply tires:
Flexible sidewalls
Reduced fuel consumption due to less rolling resistance
A softer ride because of the layout of the tire's plies and because of the flex of the sidewalls more stable contact with the road service.
Steel Belted â€“ Results in tougher overall construction
Longer Tread Life
Wider Footprint
Less ground compaction and damage
Reduction in tire replacement due to less heat generated by the tire.
Reduced machine maintenance costs.
