Once the required excess velocity v∞ (sometimes called characteristic velocity) is determined, the injection velocity at periapsis for a hyperbola is:





v

p

r

v

{\displaystyle v_{p}={\sqrt {2\mu /r_{p}+v_{\infty }^{2}}}\,}

The excess velocity vector for a hyperbola is displaced from the periapsis tangent by a characteristic angle, therefore the periapsis injection burn must lead the planetary departure point by the same angle:

{\displaystyle \delta =\arcsin(1/e)\,}

The geometric equation for eccentricity of an ellipse cannot be used for a hyperbola. But the eccentricity can be calculated from dynamics formulations as:




e

ϵ

h

μ

,


{\displaystyle e={\sqrt {1+{\frac {2\epsilon h^{2}}{\mu ^{2}}}}},}

where h is the specific angular momentum as given above in the Orbital flight section, calculated at the periapsis:




h
=

r

p



v

p


,



{\displaystyle h=r_{p}v_{p},\,}

and ε is the specific energy:

{\displaystyle \epsilon =v^{2}/2-\mu /r\,}

Also, the equations for r and v given in Orbital flight depend on the semi-major axis, and thus are unusable for an escape trajectory. But setting radius at periapsis equal to the r equation at zero anomaly gives an alternate expression for the semi-latus rectum:




p
=

r

p


(

e
)
,



{\displaystyle p=r_{p}(1+e),\,}

which gives a more general equation for radius versus anomaly which is usable at any eccentricity:




r
=




r

1

e
)


(

)






{\displaystyle r={\frac {r_{p}(1+e)}{(1+e\cos \nu )}}\,}

Substituting the alternate expression for p also gives an alternate expression for a (which is defined for a hyperbola, but no longer represents the semi-major axis). This gives an equation for velocity versus radius which is likewise usable at any eccentricity:




v

{\displaystyle v={\sqrt {\mu \left({\frac {2}{r}}-{\frac {(1-e^{2})}{r_{p}(1+e)}}\right)}}\,}

The equations for flight path angle and anomaly versus time given in Orbital flight are also usable for hyperbolic trajectories.
