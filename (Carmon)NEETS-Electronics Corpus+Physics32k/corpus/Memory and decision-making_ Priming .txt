The priming effect is another key aspect of how memory influences decisions. Priming activates a certain memory node that results in easier accessibility later on. A recent study examined the impact of playing certain types of music in a store that sells wine. German wines were sold at a higher rate when German music was played, and French wines sold better when French music was played. This effect resulted in a quarter of the variance in wine sales. Priming increases the accessibility of a memory and may be the reason we chose one alternative over the other.
