Transmission Media
The transmission medium is a physical transmission path
between two devices. A transmission medium could be a
guided hard-wired medium (e.g., the twisted pair cable used
in the telephone network), a coaxial cable used by CATV, or
optical ﬁber. It could be an unguided medium through atmos-
phere, such as microwave, laser, or infrared. Most LANs use
the guided transmission medium in a building. The unguided
medium would be used when there is a need to connect two
LANs in different buildings and when the digging of the
ground between two buildings is very difﬁcult. Until recently,
wireless LAN using microwave radio at the same building or
nearby buildings has become a very popular way to connect
portable devices together in the network with the data rate up
to 10 Mbps.
