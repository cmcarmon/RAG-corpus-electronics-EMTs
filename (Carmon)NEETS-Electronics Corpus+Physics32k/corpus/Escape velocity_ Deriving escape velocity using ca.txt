Let G be the gravitational constant and let M be the mass of the earth (or other gravitating body) and m be the mass of the escaping body or projectile. At a distance r from the centre of gravitation the body feels an attractive force




F

.


{\displaystyle F=G{\frac {Mm}{r^{2}}}.}

The work needed to move the body over a small distance dr against this force is therefore given by

{\displaystyle dW=Fdr=-G{\frac {Mm}{r^{2}}}\,dr,}

where the minus sign indicates the force acts in the opposite sense of

{\displaystyle dr}

The total work needed to move the body from the surface r0 of the gravitating body to infinity is then

{\displaystyle W=\int _{r_{0}}^{\infty }-G{\frac {Mm}{r^{2}}}\,dr=-G{\frac {Mm}{r_{0}}}=-mgr_{0}.}

This is the minimal required kinetic energy to be able to reach infinity, so the escape velocity v0 satisfies
