cannot “disappear” when you apply parallel/series combining rules, circuit simpliﬁcations such as current
and voltage divider should not be applied in most cases. Analysis of circuits containing dependent sources
essentially requires use of formal methods, like the node method (Section 3.15). Using the node method for
such circuits is not diﬃcult, with node voltages deﬁned across the source treated as if they were known (as
with independent sources). Consider the circuit shown on the top in Figure 3.39.
