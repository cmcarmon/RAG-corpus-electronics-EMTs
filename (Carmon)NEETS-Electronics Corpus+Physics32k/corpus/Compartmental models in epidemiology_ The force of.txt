Note that in the above model the function:




F
=
β
I
,


{\displaystyle F=\beta I,}

models the transition rate from the compartment of susceptible individuals to the compartment of infectious individuals, so that it is called the force of infection. However, for large classes of communicable diseases it is more realistic to consider a force of infection that does not depend on the absolute number of infectious subjects, but on their fraction (with respect to the total constant population



N


{\displaystyle N}
):




F
=
β


I
N


.


{\displaystyle F=\beta {\frac {I}{N}}.}

Capasso and, afterwards, other authors have proposed nonlinear forces of infection to model more realistically the contagion process.
