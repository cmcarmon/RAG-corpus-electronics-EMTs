In Riemannian geometry, two Riemannian metrics



g


{\displaystyle g}
and



h


{\displaystyle h}
on a smooth manifold



M


{\displaystyle M}
are called conformally equivalent if



g
=
u
h


{\displaystyle g=uh}
for some positive function



u


{\displaystyle u}
on



M


{\displaystyle M}
. The function



u


{\displaystyle u}
is called the conformal factor.
A diffeomorphism between two Riemannian manifolds is called a conformal map if the pulled back metric is conformally equivalent to the original one. For example, stereographic projection of a sphere onto the plane augmented with a point at infinity is a conformal map.
One can also define a conformal structure on a smooth manifold, as a class of conformally equivalent Riemannian metrics.
