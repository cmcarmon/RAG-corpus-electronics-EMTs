function	as	desired.	When	an	electric	supply	can	perform	its	function	by	distributing
electricity	to	the	opening	of	a	circuit,	the	electric	current	will	keep	on	flowing;	its	flow	can
be	uncontrollable,	which	can	destroy	a	system’s	integrity.	Usually,	without	the	opposition,
a	circuit	ends	up	taking	too	much	load.
The	term	for	this	opposing	material	is	resistance;	it	goes	hand	in	hand	with	the	term
conductance.	And,	as	mentioned	in	the	first	chapter,	it	is	the	representation	of	the	current
flow	in	a	circuit.
