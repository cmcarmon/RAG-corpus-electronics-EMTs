The correction is small for objects at the poles of the ecliptic. Elsewhere, it is approximately an annual sine curve, and the highest amplitude occurs on the ecliptic. The maximum correction corresponds to the time in which light travels the distance from the barycentre to the Earth, i.e. Â±8.3 min (500 s, 0.0058 days).
