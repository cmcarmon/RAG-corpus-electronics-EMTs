Ultrasonic flowmeters were first introduced into industrial markets in 1963 by Tokyo Keiki (now Tokimec) in Japan. Custody transfer measurements have been around for a long time, and over the past ten years, Coriolis and ultrasonic meters have become the flowmeters of choice for custody transfer in the oil and gas industry.
Ultrasonic meters provide volumetric flow rate. They typically use the transit-time method, where sounds waves transmitted in the direction of fluid flow travel faster than those travelling upstream. The transit time difference is proportional to fluid velocity. Ultrasonic flow meters have negligible pressure drop if recommended installation is followed, have high turndown capability, and can handle a wide range of applications. Crude oil production, transportation, and processing are typical applications for this technology.
The use of ultrasonic flowmeters is continuing to grow for custody transfer. Unlike PD and turbine meters, ultrasonic flowmeters do not have moving parts. Pressure drop is much reduced with an ultrasonic meter when compared to PD, turbine, and DP meters. Installation of ultrasonic meters is relatively straightforward, and maintenance requirements are low.
In June 1998, The American Gas Association published a standard called AGA-9. This standard lays out the criteria for the use of Ultrasonic flowmeters for Custody Transfer of Natural Gas.
