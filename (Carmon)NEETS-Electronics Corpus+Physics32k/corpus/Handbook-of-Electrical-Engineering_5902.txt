The  pulsating  voltage  waveform  generated  by  the  simple  dc
machine usually cannot meet the requirement of practical applica-
tions. An improvement can be made with more pairs of conductors.
These conductors are placed in slots that are made equidistant on the
rotor surface. Each pair of conductors can generate a voltage wave-
form similar to the one in Fig. 66.8, but there are time shifts among
these waveforms due to the spatial displacement among the conduc-
tor  pairs.  For  instance,  when  an  individual  voltage  is  minimum
(zero), other voltages are not. If these voltage waveforms are added,
the result is a near constant voltage waveform. This improvement of
the dc waveform requires many pairs of the copper segments and a
pair of brushes.
