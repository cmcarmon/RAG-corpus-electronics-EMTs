A  C3  system  can  be  visualized  as  shown  in  Fig. 103.1.  Within  the  constraints  imposed  by  organization,
doctrine, 
and the skills of the personnel of the military unit, the commander plans and controls his forces. At
a basic level, command and control is a resource allocation problem, which often must be solved under much
tighter time horizons and subject to greater uncertainty levels than exist in civil applications.
