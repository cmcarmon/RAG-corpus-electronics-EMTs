between  the  devices,  the  outputs  of  any  inactive 
devices  are  placed  in  a  high-impedance  state  in 
which the voltage at the output can safely take any 
value  within  the  logic  range  without  causing 
damage  to  the  inactive  device.  Modern  high-
impedance  instruments  will  usually  produce  a 
misleading 
such 
circumstances and this can sometimes be confused 
with nodes that are actually pulsing.
