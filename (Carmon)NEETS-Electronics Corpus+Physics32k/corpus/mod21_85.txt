Capacitance is that property of a circuit that produces an electrostatic field when two conducting
bodies separated by a dielectric material have a potential applied to them. Capacitors are made by
compressing an insulating material (dielectric) between two conductors (plates). The farad is the basic
measurement of capacitance. It is dependent upon the area of the plates, the distance between the plates,
and the type of dielectric used. Electrically, the farad is a measure of 1 coulomb of potential charged by 1
volt. A coulomb (the amount of current flow maintained at 1 ampere that passes a given point of a circuit
in 1 second) is a large charge. Most capacitors are measured in millionths of a farad (microfarad),
expressed as Âµ F, or in one-millionth of a microfarad (picofarad), expressed as pF.
