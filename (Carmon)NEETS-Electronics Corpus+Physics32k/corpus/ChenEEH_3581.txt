As a result, the current technological trend is to sample and
quantize the signals as early as possible so that most of the
operations are performed in the digital domain. The sampling
process consists of transforming a continuous signal into a
discrete signal (a sequence). This transformation is necessary
because digital machines are suitable to manipulate sequences
of quantized numbers at high speed. Therefore, quantization
