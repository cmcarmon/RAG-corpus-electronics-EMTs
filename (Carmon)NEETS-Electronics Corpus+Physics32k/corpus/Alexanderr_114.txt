2.77 Suppose your circuit laboratory has the following
standard commercially available resistors in large
quantities:
1.8 ⍀    20 ⍀    300 ⍀    24 k⍀    56 k⍀
Using series and parallel combinations and a
minimum number of available resistors, how would
you obtain the following resistances for an electronic
circuit design?
