J-K bistables 
 
J-K  bistables  have  two  clocked  inputs  (J  and  K), 
two  direct 
inputs  (PRESET  and  CLEAR),  a 
CLOCK  (CK)  input,  and  outputs  (Q  and  Q).  As 
with  R-S  bistables, 
are 
complementary  (i.e.  when  one  is  0  the  other  is  1, 
and  vice  versa).  Similarly,  the  PRESET  and 
CLEAR inputs are invariably both active low (i.e. a
