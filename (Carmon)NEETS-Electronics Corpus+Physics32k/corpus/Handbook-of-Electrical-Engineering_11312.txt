Design
An ICD system consists of three main components: the programmer, the leads, and the pulse generator. The
programmer provides a link to the ICD after it has been implanted and is similar to the pacemaker programmer.
The  leads  deliver  the  energy  from  the  ICD  to  the  heart  for  deÔ¨Åbrillation,  as  well  as  provide  for  pacing  and
sensing capabilities. The ICD pulse generator is an ever-evolving technology capable of delivering sophisticated
cardiac rhythm management to the patient and diagnostics to the physician. As technology advances, ICDs will
become smaller, more reliable, and more versatile.
