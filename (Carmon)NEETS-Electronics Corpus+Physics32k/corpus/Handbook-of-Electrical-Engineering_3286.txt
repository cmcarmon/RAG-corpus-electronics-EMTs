Fluorescent Lamp
A ï¬‚uorescent source is a container (transparent envelope) in which a gas is excited by either a dc discharge or
an  RF  excitation.  The  excitation  causes  the  electrons  of  the  gas  to  move  to  higher  energy  orbits,  raising  the
atoms  to  a  higher  excited  state. When  the  atoms  relax  to  lower  states  they  give  off  energy,  and  some  of  this
energy can be light. The wavelength of the light is characteristically related to the energy levels of the excited
states of the gas involved. Typically a number of different wavelengths are associated with a particular gas.
