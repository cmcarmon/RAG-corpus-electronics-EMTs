To help compare different distances, this section lists lengths starting at 1012 m (1 Tm or 1 billion km or 6.7 astronomical units).
1.079 Tm – 7.2 AU – One light-hour
1.23 Tm – 8.2 AU – Diameter of Antares
1.4 Tm – 9.5 AU – Distance between Saturn and the Sun
1.98 Tm – 13.2 AU – Revised estimated diameter of VY Canis Majoris. The newly improved measurement was 30% lower than the previous 2007 estimate.
2.0 Tm – 13.4 AU – Diameter of one of the largest known stars, KY Cygni
2.4 Tm – 15.9 AU – Estimated diameter of UY Scuti, the largest known star as of 2013
2.9 Tm – 19.4 AU – Previous estimated diameter of VY Canis Majoris, as of 2007. The size was revised in 2012 through improved measurement techniques. (see above)
2.9 Tm – 19.4 AU – Distance between Uranus and the Sun
4.4 Tm – 29.4 AU – Perihelion distance of Pluto
4.5 Tm – 30.1 AU – Distance between Neptune and the Sun
4.5 Tm – 30.1 AU – Inner radius of the Kuiper belt
5.7 Tm – 38.1 AU – Perihelion distance of Eris
7.3 Tm – 48.8 AU – Aphelion distance of Pluto
7.5 Tm – 50.1 AU – Outer radius of the Kuiper Belt, inner boundary of the Oort Cloud
