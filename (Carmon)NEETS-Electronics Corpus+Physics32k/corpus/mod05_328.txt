Now, if the rotor is rotated by some outside force (a twist of your hand, or something), the push-pull
along the line in figure 4-10, view A, is disturbed. Look at the fields as shown in figure 4-10, view B. At
this instant the south pole on the rotor is being attracted by the left-hand pole. The north rotor pole is
being attracted to the right-hand pole. All of this is a result of the rotor being rotated 90ยบ  by the outside
force. The pull that now exists between the two fields becomes a rotary force, turning the rotor toward
magnetic correspondence with the stator. Because the two fields continuously alternate, they will never
actually line up, and the rotor will continue to turn once started. It remains for us to learn practical
methods of getting the rotor to start.
