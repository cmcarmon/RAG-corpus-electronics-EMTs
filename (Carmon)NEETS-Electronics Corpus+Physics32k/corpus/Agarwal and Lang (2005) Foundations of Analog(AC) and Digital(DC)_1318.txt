Equation 9.85 shows that the voltage source supplies the current CV◦/T during
the period 0 ≤ t ≤ T as it ramps up the capacitor voltage from 0 V to V◦; note
that δ(t; T ) = 1/T during that period. In ramping up the capacitor voltage to
V◦, the source delivers the charge CV◦ in accordance with Equation 9.8. This
can be verified by integrating i over 0 ≤ t ≤ T.
Now consider the circuit behavior described by Equations 9.84 and 9.85
in the limit T → 0. In this case, V becomes the discontinuous voltage step
described by Equations 9.79 and 9.80, and i becomes
