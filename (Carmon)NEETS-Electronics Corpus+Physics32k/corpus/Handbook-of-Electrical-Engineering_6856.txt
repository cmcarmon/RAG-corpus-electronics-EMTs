The most commonly used sequential detection procedure is the sequential probability ratio test, which operates
by recursive comparison of the likelihood ratio (73.3) to two thresholds. In this detector, if the likelihood ratio
for a given number of samples exceeds the larger of the two thresholds, then the signal’s presence is announced
and the test terminates. Alternatively, if the likelihood ratio falls below the smaller of the two thresholds, the
signal’s absence is announced and the test terminates. However, if neither of the two thresholds is crossed, then
another measurement is taken and the test is repeated.
