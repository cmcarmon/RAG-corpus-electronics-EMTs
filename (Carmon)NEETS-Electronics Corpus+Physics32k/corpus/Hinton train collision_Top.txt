The Hinton train collision was a railway accident that occurred on February 8, 1986. Twenty-three people were killed in a collision between a Canadian National Railway freight train and a Via Rail passenger train. It was the deadliest Canadian rail disaster since the Dugald accident of 1947 which killed thirty-one people, and would not be surpassed until the Lac-MÃ©gantic rail disaster in 2013 which killed forty-seven. It was surmised that the accident was a result of the crew of the freight train becoming incapacitated, and the resulting investigations revealed serious flaws in CN's employee practices.
