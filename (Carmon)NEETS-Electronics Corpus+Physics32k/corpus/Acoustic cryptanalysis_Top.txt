Acoustic cryptanalysis is a type of side channel attack that exploits sounds emitted by computers or other devices.
Most of the modern acoustic cryptanalysis focuses on the sounds produced by computer keyboards and internal computer components, but historically it has also been applied to impact printers, and electromechanical deciphering machines.
