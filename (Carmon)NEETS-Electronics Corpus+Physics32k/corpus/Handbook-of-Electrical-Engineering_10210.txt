feature  information,  analyzing  such  information,  and  comparing  to  known  patterns  previously  trained  into
the system. As documented by Nurre and Hall [1989], various techniques for three-dimensional measurements
have also been developed by many researchers. Primary factors to be considered in the design or application
of a vision system include the resolution and Ô¨Åeld of view of the camera, the type of camera, lighting require-
ments, and the required throughput of the vision system.
