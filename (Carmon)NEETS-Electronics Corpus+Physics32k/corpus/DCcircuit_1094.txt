The nomenclature for lead oxides can be confusing. The term,
lead oxide can refer to either Pb(II)O or Pb(IV)O2, and the
correct compound can be determined usually from context.
Other synonyms for Pb(IV)O2 are:
lead dioxide, lead perox-
ide, plumbic oxide, lead oxide brown, and lead superoxide. The
term, lead peroxide is particularly confusing, as it implies a
compound of lead (II) with two oxygen atoms, Pb(II)O2, which
apparently does not exist. Unfortunately, the term lead perox-
ide has persisted in industrial literature. In this section, lead
dioxide will be used to refer to Pb(IV)O2, and lead oxide will re-
fer to Pb(II)O. The oxidation states will not be shown usually.
