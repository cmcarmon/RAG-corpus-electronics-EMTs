Let us now compute the magnitude of the propagation delay. We use the switch
resistor capacitor (SRC) model of the MOSFET introduced in Section 9.3.1 to
determine this delay. Recall that we augmented the SR model of the MOSFET
with a gate-to-source capacitor and created the SRC MOSFET model shown
in Figure 10.17.
