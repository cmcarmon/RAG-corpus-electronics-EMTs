When the load resistance increases, the load cur-
rent decreases, which should increase the voltage 
across the load resistance. But the zener diode opposes 
any change by conducting more current. The sum of  
the zener current and the load current through the 
 series resistor remains constant. This action maintains 
the same voltage across the series resistor.
