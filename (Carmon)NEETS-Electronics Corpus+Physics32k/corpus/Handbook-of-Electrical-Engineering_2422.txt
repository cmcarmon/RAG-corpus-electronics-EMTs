Summary and Future Trends
Computer simulation of semiconductor processing has become a widely accepted technique to reduce the high
cost and long turnaround time of fabrication trials. Physically based models of the classic process steps have
been established and widely applied, while new processes such as chemical-mechanical polishing are begetting
a new generation of models to simulate them. The increasing speed of computers and the improving under-
standing  of  fabrication  processes,  compared  to  the  increasing  cost  of  experiments  in  a  multibillion  dollar
fabrication line, will continue to drive the development and reÔ¨Ånement of accurate process simulation tools.
