You usually find multiple logic gates sold in integrated circuits, such as an 
IC containing four two‐input NAND gates (called a quad 2‐input NAND gate), 
as shown in Figure 11-2. The package sports pins that connect to each gate’s 
inputs and output, as well as other pins that connect a power supply to the 
circuitry. Look on the website of the IC’s manufacturer for a datasheet that 
tells you which pins are inputs, outputs, V+ (voltage), and ground. (A data-
sheet is like a user’s manual; it provides technical specifications and perfor-
mance information about the chip.)
