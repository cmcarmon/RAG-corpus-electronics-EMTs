The Lyman limit is the short-wavelength end of the hydrogen Lyman series, at 91.2 nm (912 Ã…). It corresponds to the energy required for an electron in the hydrogen ground state to escape from the electric potential barrier that originally confined it, thus creating a hydrogen ion. This energy is equivalent to the Rydberg constant.
