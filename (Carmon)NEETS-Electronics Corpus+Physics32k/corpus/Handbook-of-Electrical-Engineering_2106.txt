Estimation/Localization
The second function of underwater acoustic signal processing estimates the parameters that localize the position
of  the  detected  object.  The  source  position  is  estimated  in  range,  bearing,  and  depth,  typically  from  the
underlying parameter of time delay associated with the acoustic wavefront. The statistical uncertainty of the
positional  estimates  is  important.  Knowledge  of  the  ﬁrst  order  probability  density  function  or  its  ﬁrst-  and
second-order moments, the mean (expected value) and the variance, are vital to understanding the expected
performance of the processing system. In the passive case, the ability to estimate range is extremely limited by
the  geometry  of  the  measurements;  indeed,  the  variance  of  passive  range  estimates  can  be  extremely  large,
especially when the true range to the acoustic source is long when compared with the aperture length of the
receiving array. Figure 19.16 depicts direct path passive ranging uncertainty from a collinear array with sensors
clustered so as to minimize the bearing and uncertainty region. Beyond the direct path, multipath signals can
be processed to estimate source depth covertly. Range estimation accuracy is not difﬁcult with the active sonar,
but active sonar is not covert, which for some applications can be important.
