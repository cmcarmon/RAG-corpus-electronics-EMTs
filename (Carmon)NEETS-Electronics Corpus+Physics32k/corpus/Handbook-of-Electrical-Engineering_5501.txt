For illustration purposes, we consider the circuit of Fig. 61.20, where the link has an impedance of R + jX,
and it is assumed that V1 > V2 and V1 leads V2. The corresponding phasor diagram for zero R and lagging load
current I is shown in Fig. 61.21. The approximate relationship between the scalar voltage difference between
two nodes in a network and the ï¬‚ow of reactive power Q can be shown to be [Weedy, 1972]
