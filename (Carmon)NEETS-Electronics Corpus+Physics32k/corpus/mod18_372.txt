The most critical stage of the IF section is the input (first stage). The quality of this stage determines
the noise figure of the receiver and the performance of the entire receiving system with respect to
detection of small objects at long ranges. Gain and bandwidth are not the only considerations in the
design of the first IF stage. A consideration perhaps of more importance is noise generation. Noise
generation in this stage must be low. Noise generated in the input IF stage will be amplified by
succeeding stages and may exceed the echo signal in strength.
