A is known as the sinusoid’s amplitude, and determines the sinusoid’s size. The amplitude conveys the
sinusoid’s physical units (volts, lumens, etc). The frequency f has units of Hz (Hertz) or s−1, and determines
how rapidly the sinusoid oscillates per unit time. The temporal variable t always has units of seconds, and
thus the frequency determines how many oscillations/second the sinusoid has. AM radio stations have carrier
frequencies of about 1 MHz (one mega-hertz or 106 Hz), while FM stations have carrier frequencies of about
100 MHz. Frequency can also be expressed by the symbol ω, which has units of radians/second. Clearly,
ω = 2πf.
In communications, we most often express frequency in Hertz. Finally, φ is the phase, and
determines the sine wave’s behavior at the origin (t = 0). It has units of radians, but we can express it in
degrees, realizing that in computations we must convert from degrees to radians. Note that if φ = − π
2 , the
sinusoid corresponds to a sine function, having a zero value at the origin.
