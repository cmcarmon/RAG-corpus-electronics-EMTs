where v0 ¼ V
Kt F is the no-load speed. There are two mechanisms
for speed control. As the armature voltage increases while the
ﬁeld current holds constant, the velocity v0 increases. A number
of parallel curves are obtained of vm versus Ia. If If is increased
(and therefore F), both terms of v0 and Ra=Kt F decrease.
