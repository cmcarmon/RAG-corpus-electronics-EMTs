Internal pressure can be expressed in terms of temperature, pressure and their mutual dependence:

{\displaystyle \pi _{T}=T\left({\frac {\partial p}{\partial T}}\right)_{V}-p}

This equation is known as the thermodynamic equation of state for it expresses pressure in terms of thermodynamic properties of the system.
