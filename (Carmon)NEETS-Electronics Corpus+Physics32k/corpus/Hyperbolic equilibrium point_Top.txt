In the study of dynamical systems, a hyperbolic equilibrium point or hyperbolic fixed point is a fixed point that does not have any center manifolds. Near a hyperbolic point the orbits of a two-dimensional, non-dissipative system resemble hyperbolas. This fails to hold in general. Strogatz notes that "hyperbolic is an unfortunate name—it sounds like it should mean 'saddle point'—but it has become standard." Several properties hold about a neighborhood of a hyperbolic point, notably

A stable manifold and an unstable manifold exist,
Shadowing occurs,
The dynamics on the invariant set can be represented via symbolic dynamics,
A natural measure can be defined,
The system is structurally stable.
