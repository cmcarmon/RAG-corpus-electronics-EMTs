planar). As mentioned, a homogeneous plane wave pro-
pagates with real direction angles in space, with a direction
of propagation described by a real unit vector. By a suitable
rotation of coordinate axis, the direction of propagation may
be assumed to be along the z-axis. Furthermore, the plane
wave can always be represented as a sum of two separate
plane waves, one with the electric ﬁeld polarized in the x
direction and the other polarized in the y direction. Consider-
ing the wave polarized in the x direction, the ﬁelds are as
follows:
