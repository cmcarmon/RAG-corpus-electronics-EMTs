PROGRAMMED TRACKING.â€”In programmed tracking the known orbital parameters of the 
satellite are fed into computation equipment to generate antenna pointing angles. The antenna pointing 
angles are fed as commands to the antenna positioning servomechanisms. (You may want to review 
servos in NEETS, Module 15, Principles of Synchros, Servos, and Gyros.) These point the antenna in the 
required direction. The amount of data and computations involved in using programmed tracking is 
extensive. These are a result of the antenna mount flexing and atmospheric and ionospheric bending of 
radio waves. Because of these uncertainties, programmed tracking is not used extensively.
