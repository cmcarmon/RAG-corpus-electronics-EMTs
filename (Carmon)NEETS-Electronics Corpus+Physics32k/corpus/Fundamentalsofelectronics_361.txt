Because this signal is real-valued, we ﬁnd that the coeﬃcients do indeed have conjugate symmetry: ck = c−k
Because of this property, we do not need to plot the spectrum for negative k; it can easily be found from the
spectrum for positive k. The magnitude of a real-valued signal’s spectrum has even symmetry,
the angle has odd symmetry.
