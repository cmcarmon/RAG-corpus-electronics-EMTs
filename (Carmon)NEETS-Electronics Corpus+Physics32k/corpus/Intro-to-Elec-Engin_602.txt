Data Transmission and Modems
Data can be transferred between two stations in either serial or parallel transmission. Parallel
data transmission, in which a group of bits moves over several lines at the same time, is used when
the two stations are close to each other (usually within a few meters), as in a computer–printer
conﬁguration. Serial data transmission, in which a stream of bits moves one by one over a single
line, is used over a long distance. Serial data transfer can be either asynchronous or synchronous.
Asynchronous data communication is most commonly applied in low-speed terminals and small
computers. Large-scale integration (LSI) devices known as UARTs (universal asynchronous re-
ceivers/transmitters) are commercially available for asynchronous data transfer. Synchronous data
communication is used for transferring large amounts of data at high speed. USARTs (universal
synchronous/asynchronous receivers/transmitters) are commercially available LSI devices.
