Using the heat-mass transfer analogy, a mass transfer St equivalent can be found using the Sherwood number and Schmidt number in place of the Nusselt number and Prandtl number, respectively.

{\displaystyle h_{m}}
is defined based on a concentration difference (kg s−1 m−2);




u


{\displaystyle u}
is the velocity of the fluid

{\displaystyle \rho _{m}}
is the component density of the species in flux.
