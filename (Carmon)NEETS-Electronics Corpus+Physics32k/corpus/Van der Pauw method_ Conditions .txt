There are five conditions that must be satisfied to use this technique:
1. The sample must have a flat shape of uniform thickness
2. The sample must not have any isolated holes
3. The sample must be homogeneous and isotropic
4. All four contacts must be located at the edges of the sample
5. The area of contact of any individual contact should be at least an order of magnitude smaller than the area of the entire sample.
