Metal oxides excel at catalyzing gas phase reactions by photo activation, as well as thermal activation of the catalyst. Oxidation of hydrocarbons, alcohols, carbon monoxide, and ammonia have all been shown to occur when stimulated with light of greater energy than the band gap of the metal oxide. Homophasic and heterophasic light induced oxygen isotope exchange has also been observed over TiO2 and ZnO. Homophasic isotope exchange is the production of 216O18O(g) from 16O2 (g) and 18O2 (g). Heterophasic isotope exchange is the chemisorption of an oxygen isotope to the lattice of the metal oxide, and replacement of one of the oxygens in the gas phase with the lattice oxygen as shown in the following reaction.
18O2 (g) + 16Olat â†’ 16O18O(g) + 18Olat
