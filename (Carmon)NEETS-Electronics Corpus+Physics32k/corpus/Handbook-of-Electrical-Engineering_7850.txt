FIGURE 80.33 Differential detection scheme utilizes a polarizing beam splitter and two photodetectors in order to convert
the  rotation  of  polarization  to  an  electronic  signal.  Eœœ  and  E^  are  the  reﬂected  components  of  polarization;  they  are,
respectively, parallel and perpendicular to the direction of incident polarization. The diagram in (b) shows the orientation
of the PBS axes relative to the polarization vectors.
