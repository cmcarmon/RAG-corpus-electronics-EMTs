Figure 3.6: The circuit shown in the top two ﬁgures is perhaps the simplest circuit that performs a
signal processing function. On the bottom is the block diagram that corresponds to the circuit. The
input is provided by the voltage source vin and the output is the voltage vout across the resistor label R2.
As shown in the middle, we analyze the circuit—understand what it accomplishes—by deﬁning currents
and voltages for all circuit elements, and then solving the circuit and element equations.
