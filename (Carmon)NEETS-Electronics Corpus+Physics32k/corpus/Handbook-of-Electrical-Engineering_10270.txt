Emphasis on Communications
An  ever-increasing  portion  of  avionics  is  dedicated  to  communications.  Much  of  the  increase  comes  in  the
form of digital communications for either data transfer or digitized voice. Military aircraft typically use digital
communications for security. Civil aircraft use digital communications to transfer data for improved efﬁciency
of operations and RF spectrum utilization. Both types of aircraft are focusing more on enhanced communica-
tions to fulﬁll the requirements for better operational capability.
