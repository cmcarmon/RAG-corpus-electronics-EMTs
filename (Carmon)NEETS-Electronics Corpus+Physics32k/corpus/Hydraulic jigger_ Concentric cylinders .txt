Some applications, such as cranes, needed to lift both heavy and light (empty hook) weights. Loaded, heavy, lifts were made by the conventional cylinder, its diameter sized according to the maximum capacity. However even a light load on such a piston would still consume the same quantity of high-pressure water, which was charged for by consumption. To reduce this effect, compound pistons were used: two concentric pistons. When unloaded, the smaller central piston would move first. Only if this was held down by the load, the larger outer piston would also begin to move, lifting both pistons and the full load together.
