An issue many people can identify with is feature overload. The advent of cheap microprocessors has turned
design upside-down. Designers can add additional features for very little additional increased manufacturing
cost.  Competition  spurs  even  more  features  until  even  the  simplest  of  consumer  items  come  with  thick
instruction manuals. Naturally, consumers become frustrated with features that are difﬁcult to use.
