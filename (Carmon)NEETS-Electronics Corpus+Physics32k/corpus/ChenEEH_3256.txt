Because most loads lag and the line reactance is much greater
than the line resistance, switching shunt capacitors across a
line will increase the voltage by reducing the inductive vars
drawn. If so much capacitance is switched across the line that
the current becomes leading, the method is not cost-effective
because the vars begin to rise again. Shunt capacitors are only
useful with lagging load power factors.
