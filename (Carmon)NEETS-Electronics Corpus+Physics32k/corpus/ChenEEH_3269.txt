. Series impedances: Because the transformer core has a
ﬁnite permeability, some of the magnetic ﬂux ﬂows out-
side the core. This leakage ﬂux will not link the primary
and secondary windings. Thus, the voltage at the input
sees not only the voltage that links the primary and
secondary windings but also a voltage drop caused by
this leakage inductance. Similarly, the ﬁnite winding re-
sistance causes an additional voltage drop to be seen at
the terminals.
