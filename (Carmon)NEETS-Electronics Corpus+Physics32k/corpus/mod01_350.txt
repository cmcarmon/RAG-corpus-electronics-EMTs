The construction of a common type of dry cell is shown in figure 2-4. These dry cells are also 
referred to as Leclanche' cells. The internal parts of the cell are located in a cylindrical zinc container. 
This zinc container serves as the negative electrode (cathode) of the cell. The container is lined with a 
nonconducting material, such as blotting paper, to separate the zinc from the paste. A carbon electrode is 
located in the center, and it serves as the positive terminal (anode) of the cell. The paste is a mixture of 
several substances such as ammonium chloride, powdered coke, ground carbon, manganese dioxide, zinc 
chloride, graphite, and water.
