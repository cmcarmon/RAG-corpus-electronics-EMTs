Gain functions motivated by different perceptual aspects have been used. One of the most popular functions
results from linear minimum MSE (MMSE) estimation of each spectral component of the clean signal given
the  corresponding  spectral  component  of  the  noisy  signal.  In  this  case,  the  value  of  the  gain  function  for  a
given spectral component constitutes the ratio of the variances of the clean and noisy spectral components.
The variance of the clean spectral component is obtained by subtracting an assumed known variance of the
noise spectral component from the variance of the noisy spectral component. The resulting variance is guar-
anteed to be positive by the nulling process mentioned above. The variances of the spectral components of the
noise process are normally estimated from silence portions of the noisy signal.
