Requirements  on  linearity  can  be  derived  by  considering  the  number  and  spectral  distribution  of  the
distortion  products  generated  by  the  nonlinear  mixing  between  carriers  in  the  multichannel  signal.  Second-

channels. This results in as many as 50 second-order products within a single channel, in a 60-channel AM-
VSB system with the standard U.S. frequency plan. Similarly, for third-order distortion, products result from
mixing among all combinations of three channels. However, since the number of combinations of three channels
is much larger than for two, up to 1130 third-order products can interfere with one channel. The cable industry
