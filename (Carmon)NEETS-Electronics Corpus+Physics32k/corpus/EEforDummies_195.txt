Say you substitute a 9‐volt battery for the 6‐volt battery pack. Now you 
supply more voltage to the circuit, so you can expect to push more current 
through it and deliver more energy to the resistor and the LED. Because the 
LED receives more electrical energy to convert into light energy, it will shine 
more brightly. (There are limits to how much voltage and current you can 
supply to an LED before it breaks down and no longer works. You find out 
more about this subject in Chapter 9.)
