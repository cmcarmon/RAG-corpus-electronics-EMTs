Impedances are complex numbers in general. They are also frequency
dependent. Figure 13.9 plots the magnitude of the impedances of an inductor,
a capacitor, and a resistor as a function of frequency. The curves in the figure
reinforce the following intuition developed in Chapter 10 and summarized in
Section 10.8:
