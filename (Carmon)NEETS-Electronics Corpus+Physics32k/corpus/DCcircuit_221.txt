If using a Microsoft operating system such as DOS or Windows, a couple of text editors are
readily available with the system. In DOS, there is the old Edit text editing program, which
may be invoked by typing edit at the command prompt. In Windows (3.x/95/98/NT/Me/2k/XP),
the Notepad text editor is your stock choice. Many other text editing programs are available,
and some are even free. I happen to use a free text editor called Vim, and run it under both
Windows 95 and Linux operating systems. It matters little which editor you use, so don’t worry
if the screenshots in this section don’t look like yours; the important information here is what
you type, not which editor you happen to use.
