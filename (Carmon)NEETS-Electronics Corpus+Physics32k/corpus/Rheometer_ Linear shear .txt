One example of a linear shear rheometer is the Goodyer linear skin rheometer, which is used to test cosmetic cream formulations, and for medical research purposes to quantify the elastic properties of tissue. The device works by attaching a linear probe to the surface of the tissue under test, a controlled cyclical force is applied, and the resultant shear force measured using a load cell. Displacement is measured using an LVDT. Thus the basic stressâ€“strain parameters are captured and analysed to derive the dynamic spring rate of the tissue under tests.
