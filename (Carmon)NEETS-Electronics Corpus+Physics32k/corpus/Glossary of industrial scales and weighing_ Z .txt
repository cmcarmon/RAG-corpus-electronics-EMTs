Zener diode

A semiconductor diode which is used in the reverse biased condition. It exhibits a nondestructive breakdown at a predetermined reverse voltage, so an increase in current flow through the diode will not result in increased voltage drop across it, while operating in this breakdown region. It is used in voltage regulation circuits and in intrinsic safety barriers, as a device to limit voltage.

zero balance
The output signal of the load cell with rated excitation and with no load applied, normally expressed in percent of rated output.
zero function
By pressing the tare key, the scale display returns to zero.
zero range
This is the range in which the scale can be zeroed. A selection of 1.9% means that the scale will zero off any weight within + or âˆ’ 1.9% of the calibrated zero point.
zero return
The difference in zero balance, which is measured 1) immediately before rated load application of specified duration, 2) after removal of the load, and 3) when the output has stabilized.
zero shift, permanent
A permanent change in no-load output.
zero stability
The degree to which the load cell is able to maintain its zero balance, with all environmental conditions and other variables remaining constant.
zero-track band
Automatically zeroes off the scale within the specified range, and is most often used to zero off the buildup of water, ice, and snow on a scale.
