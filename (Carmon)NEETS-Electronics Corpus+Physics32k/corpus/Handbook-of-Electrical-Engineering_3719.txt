Just a decade ago, essentially all recording media consisted of ﬁne acicular magnetic particles embedded in
a  polymer  and  coated  onto  either  ﬂexible  substrates  such  as  mylar  for  ﬂoppy  disks  and  tapes  or  onto  rigid
aluminum-alloy substrates for rigid disks. Today, although such particulate media are still widely used for tape
and ﬂoppy disks, thin-ﬁlm media have almost entirely taken over the rigid disk business, and metal-evaporated
thin-ﬁlm media has been introduced into the tape marketplace. Furthermore, many new particle types have
been introduced.
