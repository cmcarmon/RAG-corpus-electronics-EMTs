CONTROL TRANSFORMER (CT)Â—A type of synchro that compares two signals: the electrical signal 
applied to its stator and the mechanical signal applied to its rotor. The output is an electrical voltage, 
which is taken from the rotor winding and is used to control a power-amplifying device. The phase and 
amplitude of the output voltage depends on the angular position of the rotor with respect to the 
magnetic field of the stator [15].
