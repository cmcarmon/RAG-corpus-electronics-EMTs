Boiler
Two types of boilers are used in modern power plants: subcritical water-tube drum-type and supercritical once-
through type. The former operates around 2500 psi, which is under the water critical pressure of 3208.2 psi.

F
The latter operates above that pressure, at around 3500 psi. The superheated steam temperature is about 1000
(cid:176)
C) because of turbine temperature limitations.
