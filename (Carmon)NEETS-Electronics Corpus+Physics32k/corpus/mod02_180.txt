In explaining the charge and discharge cycles of an RC series circuit, the time interval from time t0
(time zero, when the switch is first closed) to time t1 (time one, when the capacitor reaches full charge or
discharge potential) will be used. (Note that switches S1 and S2 move at the same time and can never both
be closed at the same time.)
