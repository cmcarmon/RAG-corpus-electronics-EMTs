which is known as Ohm’s law, published in 1827. R is known as the resistance of the resistor
with the SI unit of ohms (), and G is the reciprocal of resistance called conductance, with the SI
unit of siemens (S). The circuit symbols of ﬁxed and variable resistors are shown in Figure 1.2.1,
along with an illustration of Ohm’s law. Most resistors used in practice are good approximations
to linear resistors for large ranges of current, and their i–v characteristic (current versus voltage
plot) is a straight line.
