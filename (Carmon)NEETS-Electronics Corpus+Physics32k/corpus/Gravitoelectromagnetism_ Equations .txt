According to general relativity, the gravitational field produced by a rotating object (or any rotating mass–energy) can, in a particular limiting case, be described by equations that have the same form as in classical electromagnetism. Starting from the basic equation of general relativity, the Einstein field equation, and assuming a weak gravitational field or reasonably flat spacetime, the gravitational analogs to Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism, called the "GEM equations", can be derived. GEM equations compared to Maxwell's equations in SI units are:
where:
Eg is the static gravitational field (conventional gravity, also called gravitoelectric in analogous usage) in m⋅s−2;
E is the electric field;
Bg is the gravitomagnetic field in s−1;
B is the magnetic field;
ρg is mass density in kg⋅m−3;
ρ is charge density:
Jg is mass current density or mass flux (Jg = ρgvρ, where vρ is the velocity of the mass flow generating the gravitomagnetic field) in kg⋅m−2⋅s−1;
J is electric current density;
G is the gravitational constant in m3⋅kg−1⋅s−2;
ε0 is the vacuum permittivity;
c is the speed of propagation of gravity (which is equal to the speed of light according to general relativity) in m⋅s−1.
