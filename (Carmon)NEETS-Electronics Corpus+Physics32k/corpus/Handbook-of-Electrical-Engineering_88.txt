Electrolytic Capacitors
Electrolytic  capacitors  provide  high  capacitance  in  a  tolerable  size;  however,  they  do  have  drawbacks.  Low
temperatures reduce performance, while high temperatures dry them out. The electrolytes themselves can leak
and  corrode  the  equipment.  Repeated  surges  above  the  rated  working  voltage,  excessive  ripple  currents,  and
high operating temperature reduce performance and shorten capacitor life.
