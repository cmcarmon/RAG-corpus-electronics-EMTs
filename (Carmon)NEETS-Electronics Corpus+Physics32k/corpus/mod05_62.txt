In small generators, the effects of armature reaction are reduced by actually mechanically shifting the 
position of the brushes. The practice of shifting the brush position for each current variation is not 
practiced except in small generators. In larger generators, other means are taken to eliminate armature 
reaction. COMPENSATING WINDINGS or INTERPOLES are used for this purpose (fig. 1-9). The 
compensating windings consist of a series of coils embedded in slots in the pole faces. These coils are 
connected in series with the armature. The series-connected compensating windings produce a magnetic 
field, which varies directly with armature current. Because the compensating windings are wound to 
produce a field that opposes the magnetic field of the armature, they tend to cancel the effects of the 
armature magnetic field. The neutral plane will remain stationary and in its original position for all values 
of armature current. Because of this, once the brushes have been set correctly, they do not have to be 
moved again.
