radar passes each target, its position is reported to the radar
processor. After consecutive scans and reports, the targetsâ€™
positions can be smoothed, and their future locations can be
predicted. A surveillance radar that develops tracks on targets
is sometimes called a track-while-scan (TWS) radar. In a
modern radar, the target detection and tracking can be auto-
matically processed by a data processor called automatic de-
tection and tracking (ADS). An ADS system can perform the
functions of target detection, track initiation, track association,
track update, track smoothing, and track termination.
