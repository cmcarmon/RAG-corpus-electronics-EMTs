The electrostatic potential or voltage between two points is defined as the energy (work) required to move a small charge through an electric field between the two points, divided by the size of the charge. If there is an electric field directed from point




b



{\displaystyle \mathbf {b} }
to point




a



{\displaystyle \mathbf {a} }
then it will exert a force on a charge moving from




a



{\displaystyle \mathbf {a} }
to




b



{\displaystyle \mathbf {b} }
. Work will have to be done on the charge by a force to make it move to




b



{\displaystyle \mathbf {b} }
against the opposing force of the electric field. Thus the electrostatic potential energy of the charge will increase. So the potential at point




b



{\displaystyle \mathbf {b} }
is higher than at point




a



{\displaystyle \mathbf {a} }
. The electric field




E



{\displaystyle \mathbf {E} }
at any point is the gradient (rate of change) of the electrostatic potential



V


{\displaystyle V}
:




∇
V
=

E




{\displaystyle \nabla V=\mathbf {E} \,}

Since there can be no electric field inside a conductive object to exert force on charges



(

E

=
0
)



{\displaystyle (\mathbf {E} =0)\,}
, within a conductive object the gradient of the potential is zero




∇
V
=

0




{\displaystyle \nabla V=\mathbf {0} \,}

Another way of saying this is that in electrostatics, electrostatic induction ensures that the potential (voltage) throughout a conductive object is constant.
