The speed of sound



c



{\displaystyle c\,}
(i.e., the longitudinal motion of wavefronts) is related to frequency



f



{\displaystyle f\,}
and wavelength



λ



{\displaystyle \lambda \,}
of a wave by



c
=
f
⋅
λ


{\displaystyle c=f\cdot \lambda }
.
This is different from the particle velocity



u



{\displaystyle u\,}
, which refers to the motion of molecules in the medium due to the sound, and relates the plane wave pressure



p



{\displaystyle p\,}
to the fluid density



ρ



{\displaystyle \rho \,}
and sound speed



c



{\displaystyle c\,}
by



p
=
c
⋅
u
⋅
ρ


{\displaystyle p=c\cdot u\cdot \rho }
.
The product of



c


{\displaystyle c}
and



ρ



{\displaystyle \rho \,}
from the above formula is known as the characteristic acoustic impedance. The acoustic power (energy per second) crossing unit area is known as the intensity of the wave and for a plane wave the average intensity is given by



I

(

{\displaystyle I=q^{2}/(\rho c)\,}
, where



q



{\displaystyle q\,}
is the root mean square acoustic pressure.
At 1 kHz, the wavelength in water is about 1.5 m. Sometimes the term "sound velocity" is used but this is incorrect as the quantity is a scalar.
The large impedance contrast between air and water (the ratio is about 3600) and the scale of surface roughness means that the sea surface behaves as an almost perfect reflector of sound at frequencies below 1 kHz. Sound speed in water exceeds that in air by a factor of 4.4 and the density ratio is about 820.
