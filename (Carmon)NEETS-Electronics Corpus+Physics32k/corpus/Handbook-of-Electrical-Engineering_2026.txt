It is important to note that for speech presented at
a  constant  level,  a  linear  (no  compression)  hearing
aid can be tuned to do as well as a hearing aid with
compression. However, if parameters like signal and
background  noise  levels  change  dynamically,  com-
pression aids, in particular those with two bands or
more, should have an advantage.
