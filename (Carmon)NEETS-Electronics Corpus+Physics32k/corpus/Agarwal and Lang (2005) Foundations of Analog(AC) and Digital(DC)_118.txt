Are there other additional practical considerations in addition to the con-
straints imposed by the lumped matter discipline? For example, are we justified
in neglecting contact potentials, and lumping all battery effects in V? Can we
neglect all resistance associated with the wires, and lump all the resistive effects
in a series connected resistor? Does the voltage V change when the resistors
are connected and current flows? Some of these issues will be addressed in
Sections 1.6 and 1.7.
