The Chinese are said to have been aware of some of the effects of magnetism as early as 2600 B.C.
They observed that stones similar to magnetite, when freely suspended, had a tendency to assume a nearly
north and south direction. Because of the directional quality of these stones, they were later referred to as
lodestones or leading stones.
