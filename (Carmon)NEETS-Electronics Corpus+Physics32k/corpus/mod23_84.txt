During recording and playback, the oxide particles on the tape can flake off and stick to the
recorderâ€™s guides, rollers, and heads. After collecting for awhile, the oxide deposits (now oxide lumps)
break loose and stick to the magnetic tape. As the tape with the lumps passes over the head, the lumps get
between the tape and the head and lift the tape away from the head. This causes the signal dropouts.
Although oxide lumps cause most signal dropouts, remember that any contaminate (such as dust, lint or
oil) that gets between the tape and the head can cause signal dropouts.
