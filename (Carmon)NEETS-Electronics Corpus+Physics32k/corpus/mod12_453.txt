The RATIO DETECTOR uses a double-tuned transformer to convert the instantaneous frequency
variations of the fm input signal to instantaneous amplitude variations. These amplitude variations are
then rectified to provide a dc output voltage which varies in amplitude and polarity with the input signal
frequency. This detector demodulates fm signals and suppresses amplitude noise without the need of
limiter stages.
