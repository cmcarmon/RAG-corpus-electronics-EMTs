Transmission-line discontinuities may be represented by
lumped elements of circuit. Figure 7.5
a combination of
presents a class of typical microstrip line discontinuities and
its equivalent network parameters. Resistive elements may
be included (series resistance and/or shunt conductance) to
represent radiation and leakage as well as ohmic effects.
Closed-form analytical formulas on the basis of quasistatic or
simpliﬁed models are provided in Gupta (1996) and Itoh
(1987). These useful tools allow approximate calculations of
the lumped-element parameters for some commonly used
discontinuities. Accurate parameter extractions using ﬁeld
theory-based full-wave techniques are preferred for higher
frequency design. Figure 7.6 gives extracted lumped-element
values from a self-calibrated method of moments (MoM)
(Zhu and Wu, 1999) for asymmetrical microstrip gap and
step discontinuities.
