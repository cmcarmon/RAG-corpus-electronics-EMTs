The parameters of the equivalent circuit of an induction machine can be obtained from the
no-load (in which the motor is allowed to run on no load) and blocked-rotor (in which the rotor
of the induction motor is blocked so that the slip is equal to unity) tests. These tests correspond
to the no-load and short-circuit tests on the transformer, and are very similar in detail.
