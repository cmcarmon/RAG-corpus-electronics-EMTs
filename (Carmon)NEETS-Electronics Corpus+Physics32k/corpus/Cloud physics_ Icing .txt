Another vital property is the icing characteristic of various cloud genus types at various altitudes, which can have great impact on the safety of flying. The methodologies used to determine these characteristics include using CloudSat data for the analysis and retrieval of icing conditions, the location of clouds using cloud geometric and reflectivity data, the identification of cloud types using cloud classification data, and finding vertical temperature distribution along the CloudSat track (GFS).
The range of temperatures that can give rise to icing conditions is defined according to cloud types and altitude levels:
Low-level stratocumulus and stratus can cause icing at a temperature range of 0 to -10 째C.
For mid-level altocumulus and altostratus, the range is 0 to -20 째C.
Vertical or multi-level cumulus, cumulonimbus, and nimbostatus, create icing at a range of 0 to -25 째C.
High-level cirrus, cirrocumulus, and cirrostratus generally cause no icing because they are made mostly of ice crystals colder than -25 째C.
