At  high  signal  frequencies,  the  capacitors  in  the  small  signal  equivalent  circuit  of  Fig.  28.14(b)  produce  a
third-order voltage gain frequency response whose analytical formulation is algebraically cumbersome [Singhal
and Vlach, 1977; Haley, 1988]. However, because the poles produced by these capacitors are real, lie in the left
half complex frequency plane, and generally have widely separated frequency values, the dominant pole approx-
imation  provides  an  adequate  estimate  of  high  frequency  common  emitter  ampliﬁer  response  in  the  usable
passband of the ampliﬁer. Accordingly, the high frequency voltage gain, say A v CE(s), of the common emitter
ampliﬁer can be approximated as
