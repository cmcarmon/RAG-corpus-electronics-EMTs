DIN 70020 is a German DIN standard for measuring road vehicle horsepower. Similar to SAE net power rating, and unlike SAE gross power , DIN testing measures the engine as installed in the vehicle, with cooling system, charging system and stock exhaust system all connected. DIN 70020 is often seen abbreviated as "PS", derived from the German word for horsepower Pferdest√§rke. DIN hp is measured at the engine's output shaft, usually expressed in metric horsepower rather than mechanical horsepower.
