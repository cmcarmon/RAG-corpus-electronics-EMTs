Now redraw the circuit using equivalent resistance RA 
and RB, and determine the total series resistance for the 
redrawn circuit. See Figure 13-27.
Given  
RT  5 ? 
R1  5 10 V 
RA 5 26.7 V 
R4  5 68 V
RB  5 33.3 V
The circuit shown in Figure 13‑26 could be replaced 
with a single resistor of 138 ohms. (Figure 13‑28).
