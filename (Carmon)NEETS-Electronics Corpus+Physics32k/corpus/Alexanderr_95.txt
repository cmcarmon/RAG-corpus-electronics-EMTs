2.8.1 Lighting Systems
Lighting systems, such as in a house or on a Christmas tree, often con-
sist  of  N lamps  connected  either  in  parallel  or  in  series,  as  shown  in
Fig. 2.55. Each lamp is modeled as a resistor. Assuming that all the lamps
is  the  power-line  voltage,  the  voltage  across  each
are  identical  and 
lamp is 
for the series connec-
tion.  The  series  connection  is  easy  to  manufacture  but  is  seldom  used
in practice, for at least two reasons. First, it is less reliable; when a lamp
fails, all the lamps go out. Second, it is harder to maintain; when a lamp
is bad, one must test all the lamps one by one to detect the faulty one.
