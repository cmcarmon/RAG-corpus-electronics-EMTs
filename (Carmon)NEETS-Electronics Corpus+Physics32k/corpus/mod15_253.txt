The TORQUE DIFFERENTIAL TRANSMITTER (TDX) has one electrical input to the stator 
and one mechanical input to the rotor. The TDX either adds or subtracts these inputs, depending upon 
how it is connected in the system, and provides an electrical output from its rotor proportional to the sum 
of or difference between the two signals.
