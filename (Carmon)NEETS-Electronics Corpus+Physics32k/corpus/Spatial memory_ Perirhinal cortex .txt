The perirhinal cortex is associated with both spatial reference and spatial working memory. It processes relational information of environmental cues and locations.
Lesions in the perirhinal cortex account for deficits in reference memory and working memory, and increase the rate of forgetting of information during training trials of the Morris water maze. This accounts for the impairment in the initial acquisition of the task. Lesions also cause impairment on an object location task and reduce habituation to a novel environment.
