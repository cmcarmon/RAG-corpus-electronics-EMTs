Step 2 in signal detection process consists of comparing the
z(T) to a threshold level l in block 2 of Figure 3.1 to estimate
which signal, s1(t ) or s2(t ), has been transmitted. The ﬁltering
operation in block 1 does not depend on the decision criterion
in block 2. Thus, the choice of how best to implement block
1 can be independent of the particular decision choice of the
threshold setting, l. After a received waveform, r(t), is trans-
formed to z(T), the actual shape of the waveform is no longer
important. The signal energy (not its shape) is the important
parameter in the detection process. Thus, the detection analy-
sis for baseband signals is the same as that for bandpass
signals. The ﬁnal step in block II is to make the detection.
