Bandwidth is normally given in units of megahertz-kilometers (MHz-km). Converting the - 3 dB
fiber bandwidth to a unit length assists in the analysis and comparison of optical fiber performance. For
long lengths of fiber (>1km), the method for normalization is to multiply the length times the measured
bandwidth.
