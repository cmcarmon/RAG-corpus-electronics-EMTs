• Load Factor (LF). Each logic family has a reference gate, each of whose inputs is deﬁned to be a unit
load in both the HIGH and the LOW conditions. The respective ratios of the input currents IIH and IIL
of a given input to the corresponding IIH and IIL of the reference gate deﬁne the HIGH and LOW load
factors of that input.
