Charge carriers:  Units of electrical charge that when moving produce current ﬂow. In a semiconductor two
types  of  charge  carriers  exist:  electrons  and  holes.  Electrons  carry  unit  negative  charge  and  have  an
effective mass that is determined by the shape of the conduction band in energy-momentum space. The
effective mass of an electron in a semiconductor is generally signiﬁcantly less than an electron in free
space. Holes have unit positive charge. Holes have an effective mass that is determined by the shape of
the valence band in energy-momentum space. The effective mass of a hole is generally signiﬁcantly larger
than that for an electron. For this reason electrons generally move much faster than holes when an electric
ﬁeld is applied to the semiconductor.
