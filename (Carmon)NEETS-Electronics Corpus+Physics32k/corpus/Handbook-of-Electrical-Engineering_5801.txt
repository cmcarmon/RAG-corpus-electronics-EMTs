Transformers are frequently used in three-phase connections. For three identical three-winding transformers,
nine windings must be accounted for. The three sets of windings may be individually connected in wye or delta
in any combination. The symmetrical component transformation can be used to produce the sequence equiv-
alent circuits shown in Fig. 64.7 which are essentially the circuits of Fig. 64.3 with Rc and Xm neglected.
