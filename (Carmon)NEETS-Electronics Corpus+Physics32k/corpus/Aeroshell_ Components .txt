The aeroshell consists of two main components: the heat shield, or forebody, which is located at the front of the aeroshell, and the back shell, which is located at the back of the aeroshell. The heat shield of the aeroshell faces flow during a spacecraft's atmospheric penetration, allowing it to absorb the high aerodynamic heat caused from the entry. The backshell acts as a finalizer for the encapsulation of the payload. The backshell contains the parachute, electronics and batteries that control pyrotechnic devices, a Litton LN-200 Inertial Measurement Unit, Rocket Assisted Descent rockets, and the Transverse Impulse Rocket System. The parachute is located at the apex of the back shell and slows the spacecraft during entry, descent, and landing. The pyrotechnic control system releases devices such as nuts, rockets, and the parachute mortor. The Inertial Measurement Unit reports the orientation of the back shell while it is swaying underneath the parachute. Rocket Assisted Descent rockets provide approximately one ton of force within 2 seconds, assisting in the descent of the spacecraft vehicle. The Transverse Impulse Rocket System provides horizontal force to the back shell which helps orient it to a more vertical position during the main Rocket Assisted Descent rocket burn.
