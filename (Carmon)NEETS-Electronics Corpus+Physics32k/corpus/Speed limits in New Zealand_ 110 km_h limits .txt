The default maximum speed limit on the open road in New Zealand is 100 km/h (62 mph). The Land Transport (Setting of Speed Limits) Rule 2017, which came into force on 24 August 2017, added a provision to set speed limits of 110 km/h (68 mph) on selected motorways and expressways. To be considered for a 110 km/h limit, the road must be a dual carriageway, with two lanes in each direction, a median barrier, no at-grade intersections, and no corners rated for a speed below 110 km/h. Vehicles subject to a lower maximum speed, such as heavy trucks and towing vehicles, are still subject to that lower limit.
The first two roads with a 110 km/h speed limit were gazetted on 28 November 2017, with the speed limits coming into force on 11 December 2017. These roads are:
SH 1 Waikato Expressway, from around 1.3 km south of the Tamahere interchange (SH 21) to the end of the expressway at the Cambridge South interchange.
SH 2 Tauranga Eastern Link, from the Domain Road interchange to the end of the motorway at the Paengaroa roundabout (SH 33)
