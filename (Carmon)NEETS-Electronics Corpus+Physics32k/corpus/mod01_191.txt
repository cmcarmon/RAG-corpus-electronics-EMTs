Thermocouples have somewhat greater power capacities than crystals, but their capacity is still very
small if compared to some other sources. The thermoelectric voltage in a thermocouple depends mainly
on the difference in temperature between the hot and cold junctions. Consequently, they are widely used
to measure temperature, and as heat-sensing devices in automatic temperature control equipment.
Thermocouples generally can be subjected to much greater temperatures than ordinary thermometers,
such as the mercury or alcohol types.
