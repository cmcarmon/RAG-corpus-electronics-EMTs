In astrodynamics, the characteristic energy (




C

3




{\displaystyle C_{3}}
) is a measure of the excess specific energy over that required to just barely escape from a massive body. The units are length2 time−2, i.e. velocity squared or twice the energy per mass.
Every object in a 2-body ballistic trajectory has a constant specific orbital energy

{\displaystyle \epsilon }
equal to the sum of its kinetic and potential energy:

r


{\displaystyle r}
is the radial distance from its center. As an object in an escape trajectory moves outward, its kinetic energy decreases as its potential energy (which is always negative) increases, maintaining a constant sum.
Note that C3 is twice the specific orbital energy

of the escaping object.
