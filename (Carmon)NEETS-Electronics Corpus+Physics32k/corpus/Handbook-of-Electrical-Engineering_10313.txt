Because of the low altitude of the orbit, LEO systems use multiple satellites to provide coverage over a regional
area or over the entire globe. Satellites operating at a low orbit are less costly due to the reduced launch costs
and reduced weight. However, a low orbit requires the use of multiple satellites since the low altitude of the
system provides smaller beam coverage. Since these satellites are not geostationary, ground stations must track
an LEO satellite as it passes overhead.
