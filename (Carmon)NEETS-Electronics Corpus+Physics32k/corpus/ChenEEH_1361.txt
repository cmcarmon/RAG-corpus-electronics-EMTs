This section provides an overview of three methods for parallel
programming (Foster, 1995). The ﬁrst two are based on
extending existing sequential
languages, C and FORTRAN.
The third method, MPI, consists of a library for managing
communication in parallel programs and is largely language-
independent.
Compositional C11, or CC þ þ, consists of six new key-
words in addition to all of the existing ones in C þ þ (Chandy
and Kesselman, 1993). Each new keyword supports a basic
abstraction for parallel programming: speciﬁcation of sequen-
tial code execution in a ‘‘processor object’’, linking together
processor objects, speciﬁcation and synchronization of pro-
gram threads for concurrent execution on one or more pro-
cessor objects, control of interleave execution of threads in the
same processor object, and transfer of data structure between
processor objects. These abstractions provide the means for
