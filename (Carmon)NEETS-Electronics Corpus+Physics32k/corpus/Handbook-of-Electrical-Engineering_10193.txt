Material  handling  applications  are  typically  unsophisticated  with  minimal  control  requirements.  Two-  to
four-degrees-of-freedom robots may be sufÔ¨Åcient in many tasks. More sophisticated operations such as pallet-
izing  may  require  up  to  six  degrees  of  freedom  with  stricter  control  requirements  and  more  programming
features.  Various  criteria  that  have  proved  to  contribute  to  the  success  of  material  handling  and  machine
load/unload applications can be found in Groover et al. [1986]. In addition, excellent examples and case studies
on robotic loading/unloading are given in the text by Asfahl [1992].
