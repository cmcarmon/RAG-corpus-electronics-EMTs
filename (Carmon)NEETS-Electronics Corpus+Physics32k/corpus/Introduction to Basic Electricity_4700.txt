The accumulator is the register most often used 
in the microprocessor. It is used to receive or store 
data from memory or an I/O device. It also works 
closely with the arithmetic logic unit. The number of 
bits in the accumulator determines the microproces-
sorâ€™s word size. In an 8-bit microprocessor, the word 
size is 8 bits.
