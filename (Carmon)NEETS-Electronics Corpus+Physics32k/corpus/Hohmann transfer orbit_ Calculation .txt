For a small body orbiting another much larger body, such as a satellite orbiting Earth, the total energy of the smaller body is the sum of its kinetic energy and potential energy, and this total energy also equals half the potential at the average distance

{\displaystyle E={\frac {mv^{2}}{2}}-{\frac {GMm}{r}}={\frac {-GMm}{2a}}.}

{\displaystyle v^{2}=\mu \left({\frac {2}{r}}-{\frac {1}{a}}\right),}

where:

{\displaystyle v}

M


{\displaystyle \mu =GM}
is the standard gravitational parameter of the primary body, assuming

is not significantly bigger than

{\displaystyle M}

r


{\displaystyle r}
is the distance of the orbiting body from the primary focus,




a


{\displaystyle a}
is the semi-major axis of the body's orbit.
Therefore, the delta-v required for the Hohmann transfer can be computed as follows, under the assumption of instantaneous impulses:

{\displaystyle \Delta v_{2}={\sqrt {\frac {\mu }{r_{2}}}}\left(1-{\sqrt {\frac {2r_{1}}{r_{1}+r_{2}}}}\right),}

to leave the elliptical orbit at

{\displaystyle r_{1}}
and




r

{\displaystyle r_{2}}
corresponds to the periapsis distance (apoapsis distance) of the Hohmann elliptical transfer orbit. Typically,



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }
is given in units of m3/s2, as such be sure to use meters, not kilometers, for

In application to traveling from one celestial body to another it is crucial to start maneuver at the time when the two bodies are properly aligned. Considering the target angular velocity being
