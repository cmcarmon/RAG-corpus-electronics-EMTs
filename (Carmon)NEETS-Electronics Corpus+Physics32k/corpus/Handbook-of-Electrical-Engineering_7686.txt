Most nonvolatile cells rely on trapped charge stored on a ﬂoating
gate  in  an  FET.  These  can  be  rewritten  many  times.  The  trapped
charge is subject to very long term leakage, on the order of ten years.
The  number  of  times  the  cell  may  be  rewritten  is  limited  by  pro-
gramming  stress-induced  degradation  of  the  dielectric.  Charge
avalanche injec-
reaches the ﬂoating gate either by 
tion
 from a region near the drain. Both phenomena are induced by
over-voltage  conditions  and  hence  the  degradation  after  repeated
erase/write  cycles.  Commercially  available  chips  typically  promise
100 to 100,000 write cycles. Erasure of charge from the ﬂoating gate
may  be  by  tunneling  or  by  exposure  to  ultraviolet  light. Asperities
on the polysilicon gate and silicon-rich oxide have both been shown
to enhance charging and discharging of the gate. The nomenclature
used  is  not  entirely  consistent  throughout  the  industry.  However,
EPROM  is  generally  used  to  describe  cells  which  are  electronically
written but UV erased. EEPROM is used to describe cells which are
electronically both written and erased.
