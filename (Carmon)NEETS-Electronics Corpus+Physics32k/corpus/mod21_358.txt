An air-mounted bolometer provides a power sensitivity 100 or more times greater than that provided 
by static calorimetric devices. Additional sensitivity may be obtained by mounting the element within an 
evacuated envelope to eliminate convective heat loss. The small size of bolometer elements is associated 
with small thermal mass and short thermal time constants. The thermal time constant varies directly with 
the volume-to-area ratio of the element for a particular shape and composition. Typical time is up to 0.1
