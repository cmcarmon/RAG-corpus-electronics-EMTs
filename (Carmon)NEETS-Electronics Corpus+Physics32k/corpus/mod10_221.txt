As the generator potential decreases back to zero, the potential of the antenna begins to discharge. 
During the discharging process, the electrostatic field collapses and the direction of current flow reverses, 
as shown in view D. When the current again begins to flow, an associated magnetic field is generated. 
Eventually, the electrostatic field completely collapses, the generator potential reverses, and current is 
maximum, as shown in view E. As charges collect at each end of the antenna, an electrostatic field is 
produced and current flow decreases. This causes the magnetic field to begin collapsing. The collapsing 
magnetic field produces more current flow, a greater accumulation of charge, and a greater electrostatic 
field. The antenna gradually reaches the condition shown in view F, where current is zero and the 
collected charges are maximum.
