A sudden change in the load of the generator, e.g., from P1 to P2, will cause the rotor to slow down so that
the  power  angle d  is  increased  to  supply  the  additional  power  to  the  load.  However,  the  deceleration  of  the
rotor cannot stop instantaneously. Hence, although at d2 the developed power is sufÔ¨Åcient to supply the load,
the rotor will overshoot d2 until a large enough opposite torque is built up to stop deceleration. Now the excess
energy will start accelerating the rotor to decrease d. Depending on the inertia and damping, these oscillations
will die out or the machine will become unstable and lose its synchronism to drop out of the system. This is
the basic transient operation of a synchronous generator. Note that during this operation it may be possible
for d to become larger than 90o and the machine still stay stable. Thus d  = 90o is not the transient stability limit.
