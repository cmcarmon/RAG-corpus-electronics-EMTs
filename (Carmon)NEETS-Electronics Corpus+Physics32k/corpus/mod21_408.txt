The reaction type derives its name from the fact that it is adjusted until a marked reaction occurs in 
the circuit being measured. For example, the wavemeter is loosely coupled to an oscillator, and the 
resonant circuit of the meter is adjusted until it is in resonance with the oscillator frequency. The setting 
of the wavemeter dial is made by observing the output current of the oscillator. At resonance, the 
wavemeter circuit takes energy from the oscillator, causing the current to dip sharply. The frequency of 
the oscillator is then determined from the calibrated dial of the wavemeter.
