The expansion of the universe is parametrized by a dimensionless scale factor



a
=
a
(
t
)


{\displaystyle a=a(t)}
(with time



t


{\displaystyle t}
counted from the birth of the universe), defined relative to the present day, so




a

0


=
a
(

t

0


)
=
1


{\displaystyle a_{0}=a(t_{0})=1}
; the usual convention in cosmology is that subscript 0 denotes present-day values, so




t

0




{\displaystyle t_{0}}
is the current age of the universe. The scale factor is related to the observed redshift

{\displaystyle z}
of the light emitted at time

{\displaystyle {1 \over a(t_{\mathrm {em} })}=1+z.}

The expansion rate is described by the time-dependent Hubble parameter,



H
(
t
)


{\displaystyle H(t)}
, defined as




H
(
t
)
≡




a
˙


a


,


{\displaystyle H(t)\equiv {\frac {\dot {a}}{a}},}

where






a

{\displaystyle {\dot {a}}}
is the time-derivative of the scale factor. The first Friedmann equation gives the expansion rate in terms of the matter+radiation density



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
, the curvature



k


{\displaystyle k}

Λ


{\displaystyle \Lambda }

, and the gravitational constant

{\displaystyle h\equiv H_{0}/(100\;\mathrm {km\;s^{-1}\;Mpc^{-1}} )}
is the reduced Hubble constant. If the cosmological constant were actually zero, the critical density would also mark the dividing line between eventual recollapse of the universe to a Big Crunch, or unlimited expansion. For the Lambda-CDM model with a positive cosmological constant (as observed), the universe is predicted to expand forever regardless of whether the total density is slightly above or below the critical density; though other outcomes are possible in extended models where the dark energy is not constant but actually time-dependent.
It is standard to define the present-day density parameter

{\displaystyle \Omega _{x}\equiv {\frac {\rho _{x}(t=t_{0})}{\rho _{\mathrm {crit} }}}={\frac {8\pi G\rho _{x}(t=t_{0})}{3H_{0}^{2}}}}

where the subscript x is one of "b" for baryons, "c" for cold dark matter, "rad" for radiation (photons plus relativistic neutrinos), and "DE" or "Λ" for dark energy.
Since the densities of various species scale as different powers of



a


{\displaystyle a}
, e.g.

{\displaystyle a^{-3}}
for matter etc., the Friedmann equation can be conveniently rewritten in terms of the various density parameters as

where w is the equation of state of dark energy, and assuming negligible neutrino mass (significant neutrino mass requires a more complex equation). The various



Ω


{\displaystyle \Omega }
parameters add up to 1 by construction. In the general case this is integrated by computer to give the expansion history a(t) and also observable distance-redshift relations for any chosen values of the cosmological parameters, which can then be compared with observations such as supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations.
In the minimal 6-parameter Lambda-CDM model, it is assumed that curvature
