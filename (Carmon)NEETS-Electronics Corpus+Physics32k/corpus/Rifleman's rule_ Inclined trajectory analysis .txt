The situation of shooting on an incline is illustrated in Figure 4.

Figure 4 illustrates both the horizontal shooting situation and the inclined shooting situation. When shooting on an incline with a rifle that has been zeroed at




R

H




{\displaystyle R_{H}}
, the bullet will impact along the incline as if it were zeroed at a longer range




R

S




{\displaystyle R_{S}}
. Observe that if the rifleman does not make a range adjustment, his rifle will appear to hit above its intended aim point. In fact, riflemen often report their rifle "shoots high" when they engage a target on an incline and they have not applied the rifleman's rule.
Equation 6 is the exact form of the rifleman's equation. It is derived from Equation 11 in Trajectory.

{\displaystyle R_{S}=R_{H}\,(1-\tan(\delta \theta )\tan(\alpha ))\sec(\alpha )\,}
(Equation 6)
The complete derivation of Equation 6 is given below. Equation 6 is valid for all

{\displaystyle \delta \theta }
,

{\displaystyle \alpha }
, and

{\displaystyle R_{H}}
. For small

{\displaystyle \delta \theta }

{\displaystyle 1-\tan(\delta \theta )\tan(\alpha )\approx 1}
. This means we can approximate

as shown in Equation 7.

{\displaystyle R_{S}\approx R_{H}\sec(\alpha )\,}
(Equation 7)
Since the

{\displaystyle \sec(\alpha )\geq 1\,}
, we can see that a bullet fired up an incline with a rifle that was zeroed at




R

H




{\displaystyle R_{H}}
will impact the incline at a distance




R

R

H




{\displaystyle R_{S}>R_{H}}
. If the rifleman wishes to adjust his rifle to strike a target at a distance




R

H




{\displaystyle R_{H}}
instead of




R

S




{\displaystyle R_{S}}
along an incline, he needs to adjust the bore angle of his rifle so that the bullet will strike the target at




R

H




{\displaystyle R_{H}}
. This requires adjusting the rifle to a horizontal zero distance setting of

{\displaystyle R_{Zero}=R_{H}\cos(\alpha )}

{\displaystyle R_{S}=R_{Zero}\sec(\alpha )=\left(R_{H}\cos(\alpha )\right)\sec(\alpha )=R_{H}}
(Equation 8)
This completes the demonstration of the rifleman's rule that is seen in routine practice. Slight variations in the rule do exist.
