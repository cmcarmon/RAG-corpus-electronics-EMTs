Electrolytic capacitors are manufactured by an electrochemical formation of an oxide ﬁlm on a metal surface.
The metal on which the oxide ﬁlm is formed serves as the anode or positive terminal of the capacitor; the oxide
ﬁlm is the dielectric, and the cathode or negative terminal is either a conducting liquid or a gel.
