As stated above, a grounded quarter-wave antenna will resonate at the same frequency as an 
ungrounded half-wave antenna. This is because ground has high conductivity and acts as an electrical 
mirror image. This characteristic provides the missing half of the antenna, as shown in the bottom part of 
figure 4-18. In other words, the grounded quarter-wave antenna acts as if another quarter-wave were 
actually down in the earth.
