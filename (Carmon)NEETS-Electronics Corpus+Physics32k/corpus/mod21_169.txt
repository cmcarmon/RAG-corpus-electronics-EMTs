Laboratory transistor test sets are used in experimental work to test all characteristics of transistors.
For maintenance and repair, however, it is not necessary to check all of the transistor parameters. A check
of two or three performance characteristics is usually sufficient to determine whether a transistor needs to
be replaced. Two of the most important parameters used for transistor testing are the transistor current
gain (beta) and the collector leakage or reverse current (Ic).
