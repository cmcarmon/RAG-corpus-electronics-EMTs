When working with a team, ideas can go in two 
distinct directions. Ideas can expand outward with a 
broad list of ideas, and this is referred to as divergent 
thinking. Ideas can also be focused narrowly inward to 
evaluate and eliminate in order to select an idea, and 
this is referred to as convergent thinking.
