The technology has increased storage density by more than a factor of 1,000,000 over the past 35 years since
it  was  ﬁrst  used  in  a  disk  format  for  computer  data  storage;  however,  fundamental  limits,  set  by  superpara-
magnetism, are estimated yet to be a factor of more than 1,000 from where we are today. Furthermore, recent
product announcements and developments in research labs suggest that the rate of progress is likely to accelerate.
Storage densities of over 5 Gbit/in.2 are likely by the end of this decade and densities of 100 Gbit/in.2 appear
likely in the early twenty-ﬁrst century.
