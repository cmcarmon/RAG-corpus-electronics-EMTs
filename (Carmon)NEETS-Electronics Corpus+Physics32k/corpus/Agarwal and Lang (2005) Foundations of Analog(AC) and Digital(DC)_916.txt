p r o b l e m 6.7 Consider a family of logic gates that operates under the static dis-
cipline with the following voltage thresholds: VOL = 0.5 V, VIL = 0.9 V, VOH = 4.5
V, and VIH = 4 V. Using the switch-resistor MOSFET model, design a 2-input NAND
gate satisfying the static discipline for the four voltage thresholds using three n-channel
MOSFETs as illustrated in Figure 6.66 (the MOSFET with its gate connected to a volt-
age VA and drain connected to the power supply VS serves as the pullup). VA is chosen
such that VA > VS + VT. The MOSFETs have Rn = 1 k and VT = 1.8 V. Recall,
RON = Rn(L/W). Assume VS = 5 V. Further assume that the area of the NAND gate is
given by the sum of the areas of the three MOSFETs. Assume that the area of a device
is L × W. The NAND gate should take as little area as possible with minimum size for
L or W being 0.5 µm. What is the total area of the NAND gate?

Remember that a NAND gate can be implemented as a circuit
with two n-channel MOSFETs and a pullup resistor RL. Let us call it the NAND cir-
cuit shown in Figure 6.67. These NAND circuits are used by Penny-Wise Computer
Corporation in their computer boards. In one ill-fated shipment of computer boards,
the outputs of a pair of NAND circuits get shorted accidentally resulting in the effective
Circuit X shown in Figure 6.67.
