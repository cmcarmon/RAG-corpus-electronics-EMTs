Portal features an Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device or the ASHPD or simply the portal gun. The ASHPD shoots Portals, or linked gateways illustrated as Orange and Blue holes on flat surfaces. Portals effectively function as holes in space. Portals have a unique effect on the laws of physics, allowing the player to fling themselves out of one portal by jumping into its twin from a great height. Infinite hallways and bottomless fall loops are also possible. Teleportation from a great distance is theoretically possible, but not possible during normal gameplay due to material emancipation grids (also called "fizzlers") that clear out any open portals when you pass through them, however, this system is circumvented in Portal 2, where the main character can see the moon through a break in the ceiling. The walls that are capable with portals are covered with a processed form of moon rocks, so the main character shoots a portal onto the floor, then onto the moon, and the vacuum began to suck everything through the portal into space. While the portals themselves appear to acts as faster than light travel (As they are technically wormholes), the wormhole source - when shot from the portal gun - is still bounded by the speed of light. This becomes apparent by the portal taking a short period of time before opening up when shot at the moon. Unlike the 'square head with teeth' portals of Narbacular Drop (on which the gameplay of Portal is based) - Portal uses oval form portals.
