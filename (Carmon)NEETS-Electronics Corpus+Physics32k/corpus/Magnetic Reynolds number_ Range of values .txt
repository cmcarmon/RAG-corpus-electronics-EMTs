For the Earth,

is estimated to be of order 103 . Dissipation is more significant, but a magnetic field is supported by motion in the liquid iron outer core. There are other bodies in the solar system that have working dynamos, e.g. Jupiter, Saturn, and others that do not, e.g. Mercury and the Moon.
The human length scale is very small so that typically
