Mass flux appears in some equations in hydrodynamics, in particular the continuity equation:




∇
⋅



j




m



+



∂
ρ


∂
t



=
0


{\displaystyle \nabla \cdot {\mathbf {j} }_{\rm {m}}+{\frac {\partial \rho }{\partial t}}=0}

which is a statement of the mass conservation of fluid. In hydrodynamics, mass can only flow from one place to another.
Molar flux occurs in Fick's first law of diffusion:




∇
⋅



j




n



=
−
∇
⋅
D
∇
n


{\displaystyle \nabla \cdot {\mathbf {j} }_{\rm {n}}=-\nabla \cdot D\nabla n}

where D is the diffusion coefficient.
