Here, matrix [G2] corresponds to the Green’s function relating
an interior point in the object to an exterior point outside the
object, [G1] corresponds to the Green’s function associated
with two interior points, [t] is a diagonal matrix with elements
being the contrast of the object’s dielectric constant with
respect to the surroundings, [Ei] lists the incident ﬁeld in N
cells, [Es] lists the measured scattered ﬁeld outside the object,
and [I] is an identity matrix. The nonlinear relation between
[t] and [Es] is apparent in equation 10.67. For solving this
nonlinear algebraic equation, ﬁrst take the variation or differ-
ential of equation 10.67 to yield:
