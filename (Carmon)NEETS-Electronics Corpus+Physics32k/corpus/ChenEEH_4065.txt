process, we convert the analog signal in a corresponding se-
quence of samples that are usually spaced uniformly in time.
The sampling process can be implemented in several ways, the
most popular being the sample-and-hold operation. In this
operation, a switch and storage mechanism (such as a transis-
tor and a capacitor, or shutter and a ﬁlm strip) form a
sequence of samples of the continuous input waveform. The
output of the sampling process is called pulse amplitude
modulation (PAM) because the successive output intervals
can be described as a sequence of pulses with amplitudes
derived from the input waveform samples. The analog wave-
form can be approximately retrieved from a PAM waveform by
simple low-pass ﬁltering, provided we choose the sampling
rate properly. The ideal form of sampling is called instantan-
eous sampling.
