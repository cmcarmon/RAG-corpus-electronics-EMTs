Nottale's latest theoretical prediction of the fine-structure constant at the Z0 scale is:
α−1(mZ) = 128.92
By comparison, a recent experimental measure gives:
α−1(mZ) = 128.91 ± 0.02
At low energy, the theoretical fine-structure constant prediction is:
α−1 = 137.01 ± 0.035;
which is within the range of the experimental precision:
α−1 = 137.036
