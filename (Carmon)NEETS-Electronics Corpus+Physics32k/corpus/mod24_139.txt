MODES.â€”A set of guided electromagnetic waves is called the modes of an optical fiber. Maxwell's
equations describe electromagnetic waves or modes as having two components. The two components are
the electric field, E(x, y, z), and the magnetic field, H(x, y, z). The electric field, E, and the magnetic
field, H, are at right angles to each other. Modes traveling in an optical fiber are said to be transverse. The
transverse modes, shown in figure 2-17, propagate along the axis of the fiber. The mode field patterns
shown in figure 2-17 are said to be transverse electric (TE). In TE modes, the electric field is
perpendicular to the direction of propagation. The magnetic field is in the direction of propagation.
Another type of transverse mode is the transverse magnetic (TM) mode. TM modes are opposite to TE
modes. In TM modes, the magnetic field is perpendicular to the direction of propagation. The electric
field is in the direction of propagation. Figure 2-17 shows only TE modes.
