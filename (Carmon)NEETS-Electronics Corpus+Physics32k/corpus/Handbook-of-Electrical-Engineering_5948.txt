Single Phase Induction Motors
To produce rotation, a multi-phase stator winding is often used in an AC motor, supplied from a symmetric
and balanced system of currents. The magnetomotive force of these windings interacts with the magnetic ﬁeld
of the rotor (induced or applied) to produce a torque. In three-phase induction motors, the rotor ﬁeld is created
by currents that are induced due to the relative speed of the rotor and the synchronously rotating stator ﬁeld.
In  an  induction  motor  that  is  supplied  by  a  single-phase  stator  current,  it  is  not  as  clear  how  a  rotating
magnetomotive force can be created and a torque be produced. Two different concepts will be used to generate
torque.
