Figure 11.4 shows the magnitude and phase curves for a zero term of the form (s/wz + 1) and a pole term
of the form 1/(s/wp + 1). Exact plots of the magnitude and phase curves are shown as dashed lines. Straight
line approximations to these curves are shown as solid lines. Note that the straight line approximations are so
good that they obscure the exact curves at most frequencies. For this reason, some of the curves in this and
later ﬁgures have been displaced slightly to enhance clarity. The greatest error between the exact and approximate
magnitude curves is –3 dB. The approximation for phase is always within 7(cid:176) of the exact curve and usually
much closer. The approximations for magnitude consist of two straight lines. The points of intersection between
these two lines (w = wz for the zero term and w = wp for the pole) are breakpoints of the curves. Breakpoints
of Bode gain curves always correspond to locations of poles or zeros in the transfer function.
