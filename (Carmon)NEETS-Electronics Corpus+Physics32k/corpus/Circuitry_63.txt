Practical investigation  
 
Objective 
 
To 
resistance in a circuit and the current flowing in it. 
 
Components and test equipment 
Breadboard,  digital  or  analogue  meter  with  d.c. 
current ranges, 9 V d.c. power source (either a 9V 
battery or an a.c. mains adapter with a 9 V 400 mA 
output),  test  leads,  resistors  of  100  <, 220  <,
330 <, 470 <, 680 < and 1k <, connecting  wire.
