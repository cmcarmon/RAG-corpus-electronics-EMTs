principal grid axes f Â¼ 0, 90.
In the present example
wherein S Â¼ 0:5, this lossless propagation regime exists for
Nl  3. Figure 9.6 also graphs the percent velocity error for
lossless wave propagation along the grid diagonal f Â¼ 45.
This lossless regime exists for Nl  2 for S Â¼ 0:5. As Nl  10,
we see that the numerical phaseâ€“velocity error at each wave-
propagation angle diminishes as the inverse square of Nl.
This is indicative of the second-order-accurate nature of the
Yee algorithm.
