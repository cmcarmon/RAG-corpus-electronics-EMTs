The DTFT of a signal is a complex function that can be
expressed as jX(e jv)jef(v). Here jX(e jv)j is the magnitude,
and f(v) is the phase of the DTFT. The magnitude jX(e jv)j
can be viewed as a measure of the strength of the signal content
at different frequencies, and f(v) represents the phase of the
frequency components.
