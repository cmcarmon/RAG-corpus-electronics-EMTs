The ﬁlter as shown in Fig. 29.20 is inverting. For a noninverting realization, simply take the output from
the middle ampliﬁer rather than the right one. This same conﬁguration can be used for a three-operational-
ampliﬁer low-pass ﬁlter by putting the input into the summing junction of the middle ampliﬁer and taking
the output from the left operational ampliﬁer. Note that  Q may be changed in this circuit by varying r1 and
that this will not alter w
0 can be adjusted by varying c1 or c2 and this will not change Q. If only
variable resistors are to be used, the ﬁlter can be tuned by setting w
0 using any of the resistors other than r1
and then setting Q using r1.
