superimposed  or  ‘modulated’  onto  the  carrier. 
Modulation  is  the  name  given  to  the  process  of 
changing  a  particular  property  of  the  carrier  wave 
in  sympathy  with  the  instantaneous  voltage  (or 
current) a signal. 
  The  most 
commonly  used  methods  of 
modulation  are  amplitude  modulation  (AM)  and 
frequency  modulation  (FM).  In  the  former  case, 
the  carrier  amplitude  (its  peak  voltage)  varies
