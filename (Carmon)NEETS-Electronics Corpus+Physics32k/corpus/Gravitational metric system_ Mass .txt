The hyl, metric slug (mug), or TME (German: technische Masseneinheit, technical mass unit), is the mass that accelerates at 1 m/s2 under a force of 1 kgf. The hyl has also been used as the unit of mass in a metre–gram-force–second (mgfs) system.
1 TME
= 1 kp / 1 m/s2 = 1 kp⋅s2/m = 9.80665 kg
1 hyl
= 1 kp⋅s2/m = 9.80665 kg or
1 hyl (alternate definition – mgfs)
= 1 p⋅s2/m = 9.80665 g
