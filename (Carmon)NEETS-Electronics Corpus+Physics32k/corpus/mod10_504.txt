As each capacitor is discharged to zero, the next inductor effectively becomes a new source of
voltage. The amplitude of each of these voltages is equal to E/2, but the polarity is the opposite of the
battery at the input end of the line. The collapsing field around each inductor, in turn, produces a voltage
that forces the current to continue flowing in the same direction, adding to the current from the source to
make it 2I. This action continues until all the capacitors are discharged (view E).
