Sufﬁcient statistics is a concept deﬁned in reference to a par-
ticular parameter (or signal) to be estimated. Roughly speak-
ing, a sufﬁcient statistic is a function of the set of observations
that contains all the information possibly obtainable for the
estimation of a particular parameter. Given a parameter u to be
estimated, assume that x is the vector consisting of the ob-
served variables. A statistic T (x) is said to be a sufﬁcient
statistic if the probability distribution of X given T (x) ¼ t is
independent of u. In essence, if T (x) is a sufﬁcient statistic,
then all the information regarding estimation of u that can be
extracted from the observation is contained in T (x). The
Fisher factorization theorem stated below is sometimes used
as a deﬁnition for the sufﬁcient statistic.
