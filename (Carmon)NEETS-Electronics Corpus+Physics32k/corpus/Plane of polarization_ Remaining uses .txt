There is at least one context in which the ambiguity of the "plane of polarization" does no harm. In an optically chiral medium — that is, one in which the "plane of polarization" gradually rotates as the wave propagates — the choice of definition does not affect the existence or direction ("handedness") of the rotation.
There is also a context in which the original definition might still suggest itself. In a non-magnetic non-chiral crystal of the biaxial class (in which there is no ordinary refraction, but both refractions violate Snell's law), there are three mutually perpendicular planes for which the speed of light is isotropic within the plane provided that the electric vectors are normal to the plane. That context naturally draws attention to a plane normal to the vibrations as envisaged by Fresnel, and that plane is indeed the plane of polarization as defined by Malus.
In most contexts, however, the concept of a "plane of polarization" distinct from a plane containing the electric "vibrations" has arguably become redundant, and has certainly become a source of confusion.
