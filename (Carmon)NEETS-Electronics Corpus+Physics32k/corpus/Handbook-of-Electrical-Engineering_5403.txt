The other avenue of converter development is in the creation of monolithic interconnected modules. These
devices are fabricated in semiconductor layers grown on semi-insulating substrates (or an isolation layer on a
conducting substrate), using processing to isolate mesas into individual cells and then to connect the cells in
series to produce a higher-voltage, lower-current circuit. This greatly simpliﬁes the balance-of-system design
and assembly because the converter size is limited only by dimensions of available substrates rather than current
handling capability for the single high-ﬂux device. The use of a semi-insulating substrate in the design may
also  provide  the  simplest  method  for  optical  and  thermal  control  by  incorporating  a  back  surface  reﬂector.
This option is essentially precluded in other converter designs because of excessive free-carrier absorption losses
in the relatively thick substrate.
