Notice that the power has increased just as we might have suspected, but it increased quite
a bit more than the current. Why is this? Because power is a function of voltage multiplied
by current, and both voltage and current doubled from their previous values, the power will
increase by a factor of 2 x 2, or 4. You can check this by dividing 432 watts by 108 watts and
seeing that the ratio between them is indeed 4.
