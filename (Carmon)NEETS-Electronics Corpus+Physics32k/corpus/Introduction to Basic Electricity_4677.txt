The instruction register stores the instruction 
word to be decoded. The word is decoded by the in-
struction decoder, which sends the appropriate logic 
signal to the control pulse generator. The control pulse 
generator produces a pulse when the appropriate clock 
signal is given. The output of the control pulse genera-
tor enables other circuitry in the computer to carry out 
the specific instruction.
