Practicing safe soldering
Even if you plan to solder just one connection, you should take the appropri-
ate precautions to protect yourself — and those around you. Remember, the 
iron will reach temperatures exceeding 700°F, and most solder contains poi-
sonous lead. You (or a nearby friend or pet) may unwittingly be hit by pop-
ping, sputtering solder if you run across the occasional air pocket or other 
impurity in your reel. Just one small drop of solder hitting you in the eye or 
a tumbling soldering iron that lands on your bare foot can ruin a day, a body 
part — and a friendship.
