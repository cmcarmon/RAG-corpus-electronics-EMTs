Only a very small (100–1000 Å) deﬂection of the piezoelectric transducer is needed to create the ink chamber
pressure wave if the displacement is very rapid (10–100 ms). Hence, these devices are very efﬁcient; only a few
microjoules per drop are required for robust operation. Drop ejection rates of over 20 kHz have been demonstrated
in the laboratory but commercial devices are typically designed for the 5–10 kHz range. Drops that produce a
