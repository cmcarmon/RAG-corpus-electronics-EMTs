As an analogy of a PLL, consider an auto race with two cars. One represents the input frequency, the other the PLL's output VCO frequency. Each lap corresponds to a complete cycle. The number of laps per hour (a speed) corresponds to the frequency. The separation of the cars (a distance) corresponds to the phase difference between the two oscillating signals.
During most of the race, each car is on its own and free to pass the other and lap the other. This is analogous to the PLL in an unlocked state.
However, if there is an accident, a yellow caution flag is raised. This means neither of the race cars is permitted to overtake and pass the other car. The two race cars represent the input and output frequency of the PLL in a locked state. Each driver will measure the phase difference (a fraction of the distance around the lap) between himself and the other race car. If the hind driver is too far away, he will increase his speed to close the gap. If he's too close to the other car he will slow down. The result is that both race cars will circle the track in lockstep with a fixed phase difference (or constant distance) between them. Since neither car is allowed to lap the other, the cars make the same number of laps in a given time period. Therefore the frequency of the two signals is the same.
