EXAMPLE 12.4.2
Consider an electromagnet, as shown in Figure E12.4.2, which is used to support a solid piece of
steel and is excited by a coil of N = 1000 turns carrying a current i = 1.5 A. The cross-sectional
area of the ﬁxed magnetic core is A = 0.01 m2. Assume magnetic linearity, inﬁnite permeability
of the magnetic structure, and negligible fringing in the air gap.
