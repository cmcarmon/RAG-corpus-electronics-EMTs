The location of L1 is the solution to the following equation, balancing gravitation and the centrifugal force:

{\displaystyle {\frac {M_{1}}{(R-r)^{2}}}={\frac {M_{2}}{r^{2}}}+{\frac {M_{1}}{R^{2}}}-{\frac {r\left(M_{1}+M_{2}\right)}{R^{3}}}}

where r is the distance of the L1 point from the smaller object, R is the distance between the two main objects, and M1 and M2 are the masses of the large and small object, respectively. Solving this for r involves solving a quintic function, but if the mass of the smaller object (M2) is much smaller than the mass of the larger object (M1) then L1 and L2 are at approximately equal distances r from the smaller object, equal to the radius of the Hill sphere, given by:

{\displaystyle r\approx R{\sqrt[{3}]{\frac {M_{2}}{3M_{1}}}}}

This distance can be described as being such that the orbital period, corresponding to a circular orbit with this distance as radius around M2 in the absence of M1, is that of M2 around M1, divided by √3 ≈ 1.73:
