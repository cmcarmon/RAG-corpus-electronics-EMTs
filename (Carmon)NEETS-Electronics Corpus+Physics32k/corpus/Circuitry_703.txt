Fault  finding  on  most  circuits  is  a  relatively 
straightforward  process.  Furthermore, 
and 
assuming 
the  circuit  has  been  correctly 
assembled  and  wired,  there  is  usually  a  limited 
number  of  ‘stock  faults’  (such  as  transistor  or 
integrated  circuit  failure)  that  can  occur.  To  assist 
in  this  process,  it  is  a  good  idea  to  identify  a 
number of test points at which the voltages present 
(both a.c. and d.c.) can be used as indicators of the
