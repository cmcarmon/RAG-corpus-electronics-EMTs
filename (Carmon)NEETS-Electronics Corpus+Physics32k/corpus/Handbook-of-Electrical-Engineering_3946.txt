Wavelengths  in  air  at  microwave  and  millimeter-wave  frequencies  range  from  1 m  at  300 MHz  to  1 mm  at
300 GHz and are comparable to the physical dimensions of fabricated electrical components. For this reason
circuit components commonly used at lower frequencies, such as resistors, capacitors, and inductors, are not
readily available above 10 GHz. The available microwave frequency lumped elements have dimensions of around
1  mm.  The  relationship  between  the  wavelength  and  physical  dimensions  enables  new  classes  of  distributed
components to be constructed that have no analogy at lower frequencies. Components are realized by disturbing
the ﬁeld structure on a transmission line, resulting in energy storage and thus reactive effects. Electric (E) ﬁeld
disturbances  have  a  capacitive  effect  and  the  magnetic  (H)  ﬁeld  disturbances  appear  inductive.  Microwave
components are fabricated in waveguide, coaxial lines, and strip lines. The majority of circuits are constructed
using  strip  lines  as  the  cost  is  relatively  low  and  they  are  highly  reproducible  due  to  the  photolithographic
techniques  used.  Fabrication  of  waveguide  components  requires  precision  machining  but  they  can  tolerate
higher power levels and are more easily realized at millimeter-wave frequencies (30–300 GHz) than either coaxial
or microstrip components.
