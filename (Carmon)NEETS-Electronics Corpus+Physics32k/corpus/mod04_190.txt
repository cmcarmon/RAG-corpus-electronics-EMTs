Some type of heat shunt must be used in all soldering operations that involve heat-sensitive 
components. A typical heat shunt (figure 2-37) permits soldering the leads of component parts without 
overheating the part itself. The heat shunt should be attached carefully to prevent damage to the leads, 
terminals, or component parts. The shunt should be clipped to the lead, between the joint and the part 
being protected. As the joint is heated, the shunt absorbs the excess heat before it can reach the part and 
cause damage.
