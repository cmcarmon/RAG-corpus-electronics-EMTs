A battery is simply a storage component that contains a
certain amount of power available for a circuit to dissipate.
The power that can be drawn from a battery depends on other
things besides the charge itself. Figure 5.14 shows battery
discharge lines for three different discharge rates with three
different values for the average current (Panasonic, 2000).
