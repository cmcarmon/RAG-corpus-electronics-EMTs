POWER SUPPLIES.â€”One power supply produces operating voltages for the amplifier when 
operating from a 60-hertz power source. All components of the power supply, except the power 
transformers, are mounted on a chassis and panel assembly that is hinge-mounted to a metal case. The 
power transformers are constructed as part of the case and there are no operating controls.
