Next, focus on the time instant when the input voltage vIN1 switches from
a high to a low value (for example, 5 to 0 volts), turning the first MOSFET off.
At this transition instant, the capacitor CGS2 is almost completely discharged
(assuming that RL (cid:5) RON for the inverters). Therefore, the voltage across
CGS2, which corresponds to the voltage vOUT1 on the output of inverter A, will
be initially close to 0 V. This is depicted as the time instant A in Figure 10.16.
After the first MOSFET turns off, Figure 10.20 applies. Focus again on the
part of the circuit bounded by the dashed box. It is easy to see that the circuit
inside the dashed box is a first-order RC circuit. Remember, the voltage across
CGS2 is low initially. Now, VS begins to charge CGS2 through the resistor RL.
The equivalent RC circuit for the devices in the box are shown in Figure 10.21.
As the capacitor charges up, the output voltage of inverter A rises. This voltage
must rise above the valid logical output high threshold, namely VOH, to satisfy
the static discipline. Notice that although the second MOSFET will turn on
when vOUT1 crosses its VT threshold (for example, 1 V), we require vOUT1 to
reach VOH to achieve a modest noise margin. Notice that the presence of the
capacitor CGS2 makes vOUT1 take a finite amount of time to rise to the required
VOH level. As we saw before, this interval of time is called the propagation delay
for the inverter for a high to low transition at the input and is denoted by tpd,1â†’0.
As discussed earlier, the output capacitor charge-up time is also called the rise
time of the inverter.
