2.1 Complex Numbers1
While the fundamental signal used in electrical engineering is the sinusoid, it can be expressed mathematically
in terms of an even more fundamental signal: the complex exponential. Representing sinusoids in terms of
complex exponentials is not a mathematical oddity. Fluency with complex numbers and rational functions
of complex variables is a critical skill all engineers master. Understanding information and power system
designs and developing new systems all hinge on using complex numbers.
In short, they are critical to
modern electrical engineering, a realization made over a century ago.
2.1.1 Deﬁnitions
The notion of the square root of −1 originated with the quadratic formula: the solution of certain quadratic
√−1 could be deﬁned. Euler2 ﬁrst
equations mathematically exists only if the so-called imaginary quantity
used i for the imaginary unit but that notation did not take hold until roughly Ampère’s time. Ampère3
used the symbol i to denote current (intensité de current). It wasn’t until the twentieth century that the
importance of complex numbers to circuit theory became evident. By then, using i for current was entrenched
and electrical engineers chose j for writing complex numbers.
