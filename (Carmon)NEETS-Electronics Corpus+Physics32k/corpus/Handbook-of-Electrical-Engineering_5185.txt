it. Hence, the reﬂection coefﬁcient of this material to electromagnetic energy can be altered via electric stimulus.
Relevant feedback can facilitate adaptive smart responsiveness of the system as illustrated [Neelakanta et al., 1992].
Smart Electromagnetic Aperture
The aperture-radiation of microwaves can be smartly controlled by using a pyrosensitive material as illustrated
in Fig. 58.6. A set of solid-electrolyte (AgI) pellets interconnected via nichrome heating elements is placed at
the aperture of a microwave horn. At room temperature, the pellets behave as dielectrics (b-phase AgI). When
heated, however, the b-phase AgI changes to a highly conducting medium (a-phase), which would mask a part
of the aperture, thus modifying the radiation pattern of the horn antenna. Again, an appropriate feedback loop
would render the functioning of this system intelligent [Neelakanta et al., 1992].
