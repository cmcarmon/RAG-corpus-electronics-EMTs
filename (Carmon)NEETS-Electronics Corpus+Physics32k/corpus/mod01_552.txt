The efficiency of power transfer (ratio of output power to input power) from the source to the load
increases as the load resistance is increased. The efficiency approaches 100 percent as the load resistance
approaches a relatively large value compared with that of the source, since less power is lost in the source.
The efficiency of power transfer is only 50 percent at the maximum power transfer point (when the load
resistance equals the internal resistance of the source). The efficiency of power transfer approaches zero
efficiency when the load resistance is relatively small compared with the internal resistance of the source.
This is also shown on the chart of figure 3-36.
