. Transmission quality is higher. With the digital trans-
mission system, transmission noise is not accumulated
with the use of a repeater. A repeater recovers an incom-
ing signal based on the content and regenerates a fresh
signal; an ampliﬁer used by an analog transmission
system ampliﬁes a noise component as well so that noises
are accumulated in an analog transmission system.
