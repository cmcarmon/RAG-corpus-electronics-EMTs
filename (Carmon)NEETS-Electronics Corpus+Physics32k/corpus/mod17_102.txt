Our problems are not as severe at the shore terminal where we have sufficient space for efficient 
omnidirectional antennas or arrays designed for coverage of large areas of the earth. At shore stations, 
rotatable, high-gain antennas or fixed, point-to-point antennas are used. For example, a rhombic antenna 
ashore may work well for long-haul, ship-to-shore communications when the ship is within range of the 
antenna.
