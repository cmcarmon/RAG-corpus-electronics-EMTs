overlapped lifetimes (Greef et al., 1997). The criterion that
identiﬁes (or checks) arrays with disjoint lifetimes is called
compatibility, and the criterion that identiﬁes arrays with
partially overlapped life times that can be merged10 is called
mergeability. This step is illustrated in Figures 2.27(C) and
2.27(E). In Subsection 2.7.1, the arrays ac_inter‘ and Auto-
Corr‘ had partially overlapped lifetimes and were mergeable.
This resulted in the reuse of memory space occupied by array
ac_inter‘.
