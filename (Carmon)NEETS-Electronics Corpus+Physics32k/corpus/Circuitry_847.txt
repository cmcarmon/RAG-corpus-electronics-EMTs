13. Identify the point at which the principal supply 
 
rail is to be connected. Employ extra wide track 
  widths (for both the 0 V and supply rail) in this 
area  and  check 
 
that  suitably  decoupling 
 
capacitors are placed as close as possible to the 
point  of  supply  connection.  Check  that  other 
 
decoupling capacitors are distributed at strategic 
 
points  around  the  board.  These  should  be 
 
positioned  in  close  proximity  to  the  positive 
 
 
supply input pin to all integrated circuits that are 
likely to demand sudden transient currents (e.g. 
 
 
555  timers,  comparators,  IC power  amplifiers). 
  Ensure that there is adequate connection to the  
 
0 V rail for each decoupling capacitor that you 
use.  Additional  decoupling  may  also  be 
 
required  for  high-frequency  devices  and  you 
 
should  consult  semiconductor  manufacturers’ 
 
 
recommendations for specific guidance. 
14. Fill  unused  areas  of  PCB  with  ‘land’  (areas  of 
 
foil which should be linked to 0 V). This helps
