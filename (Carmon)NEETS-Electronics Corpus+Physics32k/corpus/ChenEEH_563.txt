A P-i-N diode displays large reverse recovery transients
because of charge accumulation in the drift region brought
about by bipolar current ï¬‚ow. A majority carrier diode
may be formed by making a rectifying junction between a
metal and the semiconductor. Such a device, as shown in
Figure 7.3, is referred to as the Schottky diode. The rectifying
characteristics of a Schottky diode are identical to a P-i-N
diode, although the fundamental physics of operation are
quite different. The forward current of a Schottky diode is
expressed as:
