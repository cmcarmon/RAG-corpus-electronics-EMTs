Figure 83.26 shows the characteristics of the glow discharge commonly found in operating plasma displays.
The light comes from two luminous regions: the negative glow and the positive column. All plasma displays
on the market today use light from the negative glow but a few research displays have used the light from the
positive column. These regions are caused by the space charge distribution of the electrons and ions that distort
the electric Ô¨Åeld and voltage distribution.
