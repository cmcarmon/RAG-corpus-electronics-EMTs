An oR gate produces a 1 output if any of its inputs 
are 1s. The output is a 0 if all the inputs are 0s. The 
output of a two-input OR gate is shown in the truth 
 table in Figure 42-3. The total number of possible 
combinations is expressed by N 5 22 5 4. The truth 
table shows all four combinations.
