All the above processes produce high-silica ﬁbers using different dopants, such as germanium, phosphorus,
and ﬂuorine. These dopants modify the refractive index of silica, enabling the production of the proper core
refractive index proﬁle. Purity of the reactants and the control of the refractive index proﬁle are crucial to the
low loss and high bandwidth of the ﬁber.
