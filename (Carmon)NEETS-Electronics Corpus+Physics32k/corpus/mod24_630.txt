Following the enhancements in multimode fiber design, next generation LEDs were designed to
provide optical emission in the 1300-nm region. Multimode graded-index fiber systems using these LEDs
can operate over longer distances and at higher bandwidths than 850-nm systems. Longer distances and
higher bandwidths are possible because fiber material losses and dispersion are significantly reduced at
the 1300-nm region.
