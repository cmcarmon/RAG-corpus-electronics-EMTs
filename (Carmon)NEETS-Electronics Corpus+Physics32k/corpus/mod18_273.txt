Figure 2-8 shows the typical transmitter system that uses a magnetron oscillator, waveguide
transmission line, and microwave antenna. The magnetron at the bottom of the figure is connected to the
waveguide by a coaxial connector. High-power magnetrons, however, are usually coupled directly to the
waveguide. A cutaway view of a typical waveguide-coupled magnetron is shown in figure 2-9.
