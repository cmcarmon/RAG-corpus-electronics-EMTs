Starting with the half-wave configuration shown in figure 4-23, the basic parameters are: With 117 
volts ac rms applied to the T1 primary, 165 volts ac peak is available at the secondary [(117 V) Ã— (1.414) 
= 165 V]. You should recall that the ripple frequency of this half-wave rectifier is 60 hertz. Therefore, the 
capacitive reactance of C1 is:
