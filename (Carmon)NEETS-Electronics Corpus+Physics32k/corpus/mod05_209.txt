The rotating-armature alternator is similar in construction to the dc generator in that the armature
rotates in a stationary magnetic field as shown in figure 3-1, view A. In the dc generator, the emf
generated in the armature windings is converted from ac to dc by means of the commutator. In the
alternator, the generated ac is brought to the load unchanged by means of slip rings. The rotating armature
is found only in alternators of low power rating and generally is not used to supply electric power in large
quantities.
