FIGURE  115.8 This  schematic  represents  a  typical  three-lead  XYZ  ampliﬁer  set  used  in  a  high-resolution  ECG.  The
instrumentation  ampliﬁer  (INA101)  and  bandpass  ﬁlter  (OP400)  for  each  channel  are  on  the  isolated  side  of  the  power
supply. The diode pairs and 4.1 kW resistors on each lead wire provide high-voltage deﬁbrillation protection. The outputs
of  each  differential  ampliﬁer  are  averaged  through  an  ampliﬁer  (OPA121)  and  provide  the  right  leg  drive.  (Schematic  is
