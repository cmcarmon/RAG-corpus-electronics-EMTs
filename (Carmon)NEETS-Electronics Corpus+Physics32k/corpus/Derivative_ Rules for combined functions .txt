In many cases, complicated limit calculations by direct application of Newton's difference quotient can be avoided using differentiation rules. Some of the most basic rules are the following.
Constant rule: if f(x) is constant, then





f
′

=
0.


{\displaystyle f'=0.}

Sum rule:




(
α
f
+
β
g

)
′

=
α

f
′

+
β

g
′



{\displaystyle (\alpha f+\beta g)'=\alpha f'+\beta g'}
for all functions f and g and all real numbers



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }
and



β


{\displaystyle \beta }
.
Product rule:




(
f
g

)
′

=

f
′

g
+
f

g
′



{\displaystyle (fg)'=f'g+fg'}
for all functions f and g. As a special case, this rule includes the fact



(
α
f

)
′

=
α

f
′



{\displaystyle (\alpha f)'=\alpha f'}
whenever



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }
is a constant, because




α
′

f
=
0
⋅
f
=
0


{\displaystyle \alpha 'f=0\cdot f=0}
by the constant rule.
Quotient rule:






(


f
g


)

′

=




f
′

g
−
f

g
′



g

2






{\displaystyle \left({\frac {f}{g}}\right)'={\frac {f'g-fg'}{g^{2}}}}
for all functions f and g at all inputs where g ≠ 0.
Chain rule: If



f
(
x
)
=
h
(
g
(
x
)
)


{\displaystyle f(x)=h(g(x))}
, then





f
′

(
x
)
=

h
′

(
g
(
x
)
)
⋅

g
′

(
x
)
.


{\displaystyle f'(x)=h'(g(x))\cdot g'(x).}
