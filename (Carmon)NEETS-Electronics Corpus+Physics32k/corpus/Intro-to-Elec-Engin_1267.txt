13.4.10 A 10-kW, 230-V shunt generator, with an
armature-circuit resistance of 0.1  and a ﬁeld-
circuit resistance of 230 , delivers full load at
rated voltage and 1000 r/min. If the machine is
run as a motor while absorbing 10 kW from 230-
V mains, ﬁnd the speed of the motor. Neglect the
brush-contact drop.
