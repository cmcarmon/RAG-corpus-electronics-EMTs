Aftershock sequences also typically follow the Gutenberg–Richter law of size scaling, which refers to the relationship between the magnitude and total number of earthquakes in a region in a given time period.

{\displaystyle \!\,N=10^{a-bM}}

Where:




N


{\displaystyle N}
is the number of events greater or equal to



M


{\displaystyle M}





M


{\displaystyle M}
is magnitude




a


{\displaystyle a}
and



b

are constants
In summary, there are more small aftershocks and fewer large aftershocks.
