In some cases, both the load impedance and the Thévenin
impedance of the source may be ﬁxed. In such a case, the
matching for maximum power transfer can be achieved by
using  a  transformer,  as  illustrated  in  Fig. 3.25,  where  the
impedances are both resistive. The transformer is assumed
to  be  ideal,  with  turns  ratio  n.  Maximum  power  is  trans-
ferred if n2 = RT/RL.
