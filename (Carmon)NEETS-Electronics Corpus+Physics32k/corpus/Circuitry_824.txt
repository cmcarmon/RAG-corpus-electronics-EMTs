and connection points, it is necessary to colour the 
variable  in  your  C  code  with  the  prefixes  FCV_, 
FCM_  and  FCC_MacroName_  respectively.  For 
example, 
to  use  a  Flowcode  variable  called 
DELAY in your C code, you must refer to it using 
FCV_DELAY.  Note  that  all  Flowcode  defined 
variables must be entered in upper case. 
  To call a Flowcode macro called TEST in your C 
code,  you  must  call  FCM_TEST();.  To  jump  to  a 
connection  point  called  A,  defined  in  a  Flowcode 
macro  called  TEST,  your  C  code  must  be  goto 
FCC_TEST_A;.  Connection  points  defined  in  the 
main  flowchart  of  a  Flowcode  file  are  prefixed 
FCC_Main_.  
  Assembly  code  (see  Table  18.3)  can  be  added 
into the code field in a C assembly code  wrapper. 
For  a  single  line  of  code  you  can  use  the  asm 
operator  in  front  of  each  instruction  (e.g.  asm 
movlw  5)  or  you  can  enclose  several  statements 
within an asm block. This makes adding assembly 
language routines very simple.
