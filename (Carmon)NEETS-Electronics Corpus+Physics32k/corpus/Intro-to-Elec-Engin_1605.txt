Consider a 3-hp, 220-V, 1800-r/min separately excited dc motor controlled by a single-phase fully
controlled rectiﬁer with an ac source voltage of 230 V at 60 Hz. Assume that the full-load efﬁciency
of the motor is 88%, and enough ﬁlter inductance is added to ensure continuous conduction for
any torque greater than 25% of rated torque. The armature circuit resistance is 1.5 .
