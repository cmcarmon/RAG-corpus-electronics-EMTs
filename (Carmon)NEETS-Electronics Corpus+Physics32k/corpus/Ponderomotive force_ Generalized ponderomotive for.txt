Instead of just an oscillating field, a permanent field could also be present. In such a situation, the force equation of a charged particle becomes:







x
¨



=
h
(
x
)
+
g
(
x
)
cos
⁡
(
ω
t
)


{\displaystyle {\ddot {x}}=h(x)+g(x)\cos(\omega t)}

To solve the above equation, we can make a similar assumption as we did for the case when



h
(
x
)
=
0


{\displaystyle h(x)=0}
. This gives a generalized expression for the drift motion of the particle:

{\displaystyle {\ddot {x}}_{0}=h(x_{0})-{\frac {g(x_{0})g'(x_{0})}{2\omega ^{2}}}}
