If the propagation of excitation in the ventricles is impaired by damage to the bundle of His, the coordination
of excitation and contraction is impaired and reveals itself by a widening of the QRS wave, and often a notch
is present; Fig. 113.14(6) illustrates right (RBBB) and left (LBBB) bundle-branch block. These waveforms are
best identiÔ¨Åed in the chest (V) leads.
