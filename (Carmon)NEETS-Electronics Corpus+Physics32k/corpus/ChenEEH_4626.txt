The scheduling law is chosen, typically, in ad hoc fashion as
either a continuous or discrete scheduling law. In continuous
scheduling, parameters of the gain scheduled controller vary
continuously with the scheduling parameter and are com-
monly formed through interpolation of the ﬁxed-point con-
troller parameters. The interpolated controller parameters may
be feedback gains, elements of the controller matrices, or
controller poles/zeros. While the ﬁxed-point controllers are
linear, the parameter interpolation method need obey no
such restriction.
As an example, suppose that u is a scalar and that the ﬁxed
operating points are ordered so that u1 < u2 <  < uN . A
simple, continuous scheduling law is then given by:
