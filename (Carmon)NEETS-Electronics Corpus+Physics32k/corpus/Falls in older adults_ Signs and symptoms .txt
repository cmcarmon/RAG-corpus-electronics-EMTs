Trauma
Soft tissue injuries. Bilateral orbital haematomas (two black eyes) suggests that the faller was probably not conscious as they fell, as they did not manage to protect their face as they hit the ground.
Fractures and dislocations. 5% of fallers end up having a fracture as a result of their fall, and 1% fracture their neck of femur.
Disuse atrophy and muscle wasting from reduced physical activity during recovery periods

Due to bed rest
Pneumonia
Pressure sores
Dehydration
Hypothermia
