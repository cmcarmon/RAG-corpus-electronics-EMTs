The variety of transient voltages a transformer may experi-
ence in its normal useful lifetime are virtually unlimited. It is
impractical to test each transformer for every conceivable
combination of transient voltage. However, the electrical in-
dustry has found that it is possible, in most instances, to assess
the integrity of the transformer’s insulation systems to with-
stand transient voltages with the application of a few speciﬁc
aperiodic voltage waveforms (Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology, 1943), illustrating the full, chopped, and switching
surge waveforms. Each of these tests is designed to test the
insulation structure for a different transient condition. The
purpose of applying this variety of tests is to substantiate
adequate performance of the total insulation system for all
the various transient voltages a transformer may see in service.
