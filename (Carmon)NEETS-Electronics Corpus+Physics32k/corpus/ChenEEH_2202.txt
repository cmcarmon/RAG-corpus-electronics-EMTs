The following derivations require the calculus of vector differ-
ential operators. Most textbooks in electromagnetic theory
contain the relevant theorems and their application to electro-
magnetic ﬁelds. A particularly complete and concise presenta-
tion of the same can be found in Chapter 2 of the textbook by
Jeﬁmenko (1996). The book by Schey (1996) is also recom-
mended. Helmholtz’s theorem states that any vector ﬁeld that
is continuous and regular at inﬁnity can be completely speci-
ﬁed by its divergence and curl. Thus, including the mediation
of the permittivity function, it is clear that the electrostatic
ﬁeld is completely deﬁned by equations 2.2. Integrating both
sides of equation 2.2c over all of space and applying the
divergence theorem yields for the left-hand side:
