The sector method of organizing data on a hard disk is actually a variation of the cylinder method. 
As you already know, the sector method slices up a hard disk into pie-shaped slices (just like floppy 
disks). The total number of slices is set by the hard disk drive manufacturer. Figure 8-5 view B shows an 
example of the sector method.
