The simple power-angle relation of Eq. (61.71) can be used for real power ï¬‚ow between any two voltages
separated by a reactance. For the synchronous machine, the total real power is three times the value calculated
by Eq. (61.71), when voltages in volts and the reactance in ohms are used. On the other hand, Eq. (61.71) gives
per-unit power when per-unit voltages and reactance are used.
