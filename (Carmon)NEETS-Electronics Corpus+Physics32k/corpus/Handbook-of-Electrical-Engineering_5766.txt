Voltage viability: The  ability  of  a  power  system  to  maintain  acceptable  voltages  at  all  buses  in  the  system
after  being  subjected  to  a  disturbance.  Loss  of  viability  can  occur  if  voltage  at  some  bus  or  buses  are
below acceptable levels [Kundur, 1994]. Loss of viability is not voltage instability.
