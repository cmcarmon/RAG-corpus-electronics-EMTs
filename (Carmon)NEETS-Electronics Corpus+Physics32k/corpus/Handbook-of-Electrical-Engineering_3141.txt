supply voltage (neglecting the SCR drop) is applied to the load. For a purely resistive load, during the positive
half cycle, the output voltage waveform follows the input ac voltage waveform. During the negative half cycle,
the SCR is turned off. In the case of inductive load, the energy stored in the inductance causes the current to
ﬂow  in  the  load  circuit  even  after  the  reversal  of  the  supply  voltage,  as  shown  in  Fig.  30.9(b).  If  there  is  no
, the load current is discontinuous. A freewheeling diode is connected across the load to
freewheeling diode 
turn off the SCR as soon as the input voltage polarity reverses, as shown in Fig. 30.9(c). When the SCR is off,
the load current will freewheel through the diode. The power ﬂows from the input to the load only when the
SCR is conducting. If there is no freewheeling diode, during the negative portion of the supply voltage, SCR
returns  the  energy  stored  in  the  load  inductance  to  the  supply.  The  freewheeling  diode  improves  the  input
power factor.
