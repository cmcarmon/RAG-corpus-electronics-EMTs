The triode circuit you have just studied is a fairly simple affair. In actual application, triode circuits
are a bit more complex. There are two reasons for this. The first has to do with the triodes ability to
amplify and perform other functions. Triodes come in many different types. Each of these types has
different internal characteristics and different capabilities. Because of this, each triode circuit must be
designed to accommodate the triodes special characteristics. The second reason for the increase in
