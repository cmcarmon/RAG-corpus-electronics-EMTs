Coherence
Light  can  be  partially  or  fully  coherent  or  incoherent,  depending  on  the  source  and  subsequent  ﬁltering
operations. Common sources of light are incoherent because they consist of many independent radiators. An
example of this is the ﬂuorescent lamp in which each excited atom radiates light independently. There is no
ﬁxed  phase  relationship  between  the  waves  from  these  atoms.  In  a  laser  the  light  is  generated  in  a  resonant
