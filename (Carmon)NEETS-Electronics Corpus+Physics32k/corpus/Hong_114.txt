Electronic filters are created by building circuits that has transfer functions that 
attenuate signals at certain frequencies. These filter circuits can be either passive or active. 
Passive  filters  generally  involve  resistors,  capacitors,  and  inductors  while  active  filters 
use resistors, capacitors, and op amps to eliminate the need for inductors. Passive filters 
are  simpler  and  easy  to  design  for  low  performance  applications  whereas  active  filters 
have better performance for more demanding applications.
