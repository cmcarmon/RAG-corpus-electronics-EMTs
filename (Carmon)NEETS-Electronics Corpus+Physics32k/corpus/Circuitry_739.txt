A sensor is a special kind of transducer that is used 
to generate  an  input  signal  to  a  measurement, 
instrumentation  or  control  system.  The  signal 
produced by a sensor is an electrical  analogy of a 
physical  quantity,  such  as  distance,  velocity, 
acceleration, temperature, pressure, light level, etc. 
The  signals  returned  from  a  sensor,  together  with 
control  inputs  from  the  user  or  controller  (as 
appropriate) will subsequently be used to determine 
the output from the system. The choice of sensor is 
governed  by  a  number  of  factors 
including 
accuracy, resolution, cost, and physical size. 
  Sensors  can  be  categorized  as  either  active  or 
passive. An  active  sensor  generates  a  current  or 
voltage  output.  A  passive  transducer  requires  a 
source of current or voltage and it modifies this in 
some  way  (e.g.  by  virtue  of  a  change  in  the 
sensorâ€™s  resistance).  The  result  may  still  be  a 
voltage  or  current  but  it  is  not  generated  by  the 
sensor on its own.
