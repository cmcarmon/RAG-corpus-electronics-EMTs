Schottky diodes are formed from junctions of metal and an n-type semiconductor, the metal fulÔ¨Ålling the
role of the p-region. Since there are thus no minority carriers in the region of the forward-biased junction, the
storage time required to bring a pn junction out of saturation is eliminated. The forward-biased drop across a
Schottky  diode  is  around  0.3 V.  This  clamps  the  collector  at  0.3 V  less  than  the  base,  thus  maintaining VCE
above the 0.3-V saturation threshold. Circuits for the two-input NAND gates 74LS00 and 74S00 are given in
Fig. 79.11(a)  and  (b).  The  special  transistor  symbol  is  a  short-form  notation  indicating  the  presence  of  the
Schottky diode, as illustrated in Fig. 79.11(c).
