The amplifiers in this type of power-amplifier transmitter must be broad-band microwave amplifiers
that amplify the input signals without frequency distortion. Typically, the first stage and the second stage
are traveling-wave tubes (twt) and the final stage is a crossed-field amplifier. Recent technological
