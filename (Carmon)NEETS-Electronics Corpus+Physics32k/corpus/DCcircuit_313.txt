If at all possible, shut off the power to a circuit before performing any work on it. You must
secure all sources of harmful energy before a system may be considered safe to work on. In
industry, securing a circuit, device, or system in this condition is commonly known as placing
it in a Zero Energy State. The focus of this lesson is, of course, electrical safety. However, many
of these principles apply to non-electrical systems as well.
