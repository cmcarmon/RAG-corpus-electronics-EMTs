Thermal noise is the noise resulting from the random motion of electrons in a conducting medium.
Thermal noise arises from both the photodetector and the load resistor. Amplifier noise also contributes to
thermal noise. A reduction in thermal noise is possible by increasing the value of the load resistor.
However, increasing the value of the load resistor to reduce thermal noise reduces the receiver bandwidth.
In APDs, the thermal noise is unaffected by the internal carrier multiplication.
