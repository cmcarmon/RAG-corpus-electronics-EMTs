Signature measurement applications include remote sensing of the environment as well as the measurement
of target characteristics. In some applications, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging is conducted from aircraft
or  satellites  to  characterize  land  usage  over  broad  areas.  Moving  targets  that  present  changing  aspect  to  the
radar can be imaged from airborne or ground-based radars via inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) tech-
niques. As deﬁned in the subsection “Resolution and Accuracy,” cross-range resolution improves with increasing
antenna extent. SAR/ISAR effectively substitutes an extended observation interval over which coherent returns
are  collected  from  different  target  aspect  angles  for  a  large  antenna  structure  that  would  not  be  physically
realizable in many instances.
