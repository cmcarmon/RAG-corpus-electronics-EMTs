The  devices  listed  in  Table  113.2  are  approved  for  one  of  three  applications:  the  treatment  of  nonunions
(fractures  that  have  failed  to  heal  after  standard  treatment  involving  setting  and  stabilization  with  casts),
congenital pseudoarthroses [Bassett, 1984], and promotion of spinal fusion. Although many animal experi-
ments  (and  possibly  a  few  human  trials,  especially  in  Europe)  have  evaluated  the  application  of  electric  or
magnetic Ô¨Åelds for acceleration of fresh fracture healing and for reversal of osteoporosis, no devices are currently
approved in the United States for these purposes.
