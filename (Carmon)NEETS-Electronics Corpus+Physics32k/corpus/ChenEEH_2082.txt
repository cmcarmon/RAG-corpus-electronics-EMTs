. Type : P ! ZP is one-to-one mapping, giving the data
deﬁnition of ZN. For each place p 2 P, Type maps p to
a unique Z schema z 2 ZP such that p ¼ name(z). The
type of p is deﬁned by the signature of z.
. TC: T ! ZT is one-to-one mapping, providing the func-
tionality deﬁnition of ZN. For each transition t 2 T , C
maps t to a Z schema z 2 ZT such that t ¼ name(z). The
functional processing of t is deﬁned by the property of z.
Furthermore, the following constraint is satisﬁed. For any
p 2 P, t 2 T :
(1) If (p, t ) 2 F, then sig(Type (p)) \ sig(TC(t)) 6¼ 1.
(2) If (t , p) 2 F, then sig(Type (p)) \ sig(TC(t)) 6¼ 1.
. A: F ! PVar is the control ﬂow deﬁnition of ZN, where
Var is the set of all hidden variables (through quantiﬁ-
cation) in ZT. Let Var(t) denote the set of hidden
