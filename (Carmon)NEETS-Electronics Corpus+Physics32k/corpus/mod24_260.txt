Most present day applications that use multimode fiber use graded-index fibers. The basic design
parameters are the fiber's core and cladding size and D . Standard multimode graded-index fiber core and
cladding sizes are 50/125 m m, 62.5/125 m m, 85/125 m m, and 100/140 m m. Each fiber design has a specific
