is  real  because  the  nonlinearity  is  single  valued. A  graph  of  N(a)  against  a  is  in  Fig.  100.48,  and  shows  that
N(a) starts at zero, when a = d, increases to a maximum, with a value of 2h /pd at a = d 
, and then decreases
toward zero for larger inputs. The C(a) locus, shown in Fig. 100.49, lies on the negative real axis starting at –¥
and returning there after reaching a maximum value of –pd/2h. The given transfer function G(j w) crosses the
negative real axis, as shown in Fig. 100.49, at a frequency of tan–1 w = 45(cid:176), that, is w = 1 rad/sec and, therefore,
cuts the C(a) locus twice. The two possible limit cycle amplitudes at this frequency can be found by solving
