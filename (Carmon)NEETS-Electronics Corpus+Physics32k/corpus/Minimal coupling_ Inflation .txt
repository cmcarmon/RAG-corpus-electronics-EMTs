In studies of cosmological inflation, minimal coupling of a scalar field usually refers to minimal coupling to gravity. This means that the action for the inflaton field



φ


{\displaystyle \varphi }
is not coupled to the scalar curvature. Its only coupling to gravity is the coupling to the Lorentz invariant measure
