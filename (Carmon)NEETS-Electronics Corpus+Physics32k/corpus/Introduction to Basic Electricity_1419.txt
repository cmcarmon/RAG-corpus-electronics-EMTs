Two electrons together or two protons together repre-
sent “like” charges. Like charges resist being brought 
together and instead move away from each other. This 
movement is called repelling. This is the first law 
of electrostatic charges: Like charges repel each other 
(Figure 11-1). According to the second law of electro-
static charges: Unlike charges attract each other.
