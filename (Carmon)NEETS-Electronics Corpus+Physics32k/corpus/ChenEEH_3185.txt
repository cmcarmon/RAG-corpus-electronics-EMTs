by utilities. Insulator cleaning is covered by the IEEE Standard
957. High-pressure water washing is routinely employed and
is effective for most types of contamination. However, there
are certain types of contaminants (e.g., cement, greasy de-
posits, certain fertilizers) that adhere intimately with the insu-
lator surface and cannot be easily removed easily by high-
pressure water. In such cases, cleaning is performed by using
dry-type abrasive agents, such as crushed corncob mixed with
limestone. Water washing can be done online (without de-
energizing the circuit) or off-line (after de-energization).
