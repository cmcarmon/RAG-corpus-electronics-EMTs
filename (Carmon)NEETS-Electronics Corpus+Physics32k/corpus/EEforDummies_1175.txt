Why don’t you always get 0 Ω when you test 
a  wire,  especially  a  long  wire?  All  electrical 
circuits exhibit some resistance to the flow of 
current; the ohms measurement tests this resis-
tance. Even short lengths of wire have resis-
tance, but it’s usually well below 1 Ω, so it’s not 
an important test subject for continuity or shorts.
