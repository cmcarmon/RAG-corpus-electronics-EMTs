The resistance of this circuit is 2 ohms; this value does not change. Voltage (E) is increased (by
increasing the voltage source), in steps of 1 volt, from 0 volts to 8 volts. By applying Ohmâ€™s law, the
current (I) is determined for each step of voltage. For instance, when E is 1 volt, the current is:
