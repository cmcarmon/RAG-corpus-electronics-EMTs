An initially relaxed linear-time invariant digital ﬁlter is
characterized by its response to the unit sample or impulse
sequence d(n). The ﬁlter response when excited by such a
sequence is denoted by h(n), and it is referred to as impulse
response of the digital ﬁlter. Observe that if the digital ﬁlter is
causal, then h(n) ¼ 0 for n < 0. An arbitrary input sequence
