According to the asymptotic version of the singleton bound, it is known that the relative distance



δ


{\displaystyle \delta }
, of a code must satisfy



R
⩽
1
−
δ
+
o
(
1
)


{\displaystyle R\leqslant 1-\delta +o(1)}
where



R


{\displaystyle R}
is the rate of the code. As proved earlier, since the rate



R


{\displaystyle R}
is maintained, the relative distance



δ
⩾
1
−
R


{\displaystyle \delta \geqslant 1-R}
also meets the Singleton bound.
