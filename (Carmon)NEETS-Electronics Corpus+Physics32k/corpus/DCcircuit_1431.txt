We could have also determined the circuit current at time=7.25 seconds by subtracting the
capacitor’s voltage (14.989 volts) from the battery’s voltage (15 volts) to obtain the voltage drop
across the 10 kΩ resistor, then ﬁguring current through the resistor (and the whole series
circuit) with Ohm’s Law (I=E/R). Either way, we should obtain the same answer:
