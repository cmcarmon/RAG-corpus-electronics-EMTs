As shown in view (B), when the fifth harmonic (curve N with its decreased amplitude) is added, the 
sides of the new resultant (curve P) are steeper than before. In view (C), the addition of the seventh 
harmonic (curve Q), which is of even smaller amplitude, makes the sides of the composite waveform (R) 
still steeper. The addition of more odd harmonics will bring the composite waveform nearer the shape of 
the perfect square wave. A perfect square wave is, therefore, composed of an infinite number of odd 
harmonics. In the composition of square waves, all the odd harmonics cross the reference line in phase 
with the fundamental.
