p
-channel MOSFET Q1 will be turned on and
 through the low

resistance path of Q1â€™s channel. The turned off Q2 has a very high channel resistance and acts nearly like an open.

-channel MOSFETs, one for each input, and putting in
n
-channel MOSFET for each input, as shown in the block diagram and schematic of Fig. 79.3. The
series an 
NAND  gate  will  produce  a  low  output  only  when  both  Q3  and  Q4  are  turned  on,  creating  a  low  resistance
path from the output to ground through the two series channels. This can be accomplished by having a high
on both input A and input B. This input condition will also turn off Q1 and Q2 . If either input A or input B
or both is low, the respective parallel MOSFET will be turned on, providing a low resistance path for the output
. This will also turn off at least one of the series MOSFETs, resulting in a high resistance path for the
to 
output to ground.
