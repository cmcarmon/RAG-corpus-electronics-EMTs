Back to the Future
The intelligent network, with its centralized databases, has offered a means to rapidly introduce new services
in  a  ubiquitous  fashion  and  with  operational  uniformity  as  seen  by  the  end  user.  The  advanced  intelligent
network  has  gone  on  to  provide  a  service-independent  architecture,  and,  with  its  powerful  service-creation
capabilities, has empowered nonprogrammers to participate in the development of new services. In many ways,
as  we  go  into  the  future,  we  are  going  back  to  a  time  when  operators  were  the “human  intelligence”  in  the
network. The human intelligence was all but eliminated with the introduction of switching systems, but now
the intelligent network is working to put the intelligence of the human operator back into the network.
