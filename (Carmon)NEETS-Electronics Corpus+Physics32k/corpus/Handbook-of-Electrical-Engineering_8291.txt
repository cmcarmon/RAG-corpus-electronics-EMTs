however, some errors are missed due to cancellation. This is the case when an error in one output at time t is
canceled by the EXOR operation with the error in another output at time t + 1. Given an equally likely probability
of errors occurring, the probability of error cancellation has been shown to be 21–m–N, where m is the number
of outputs compacted and N is the length of the output streams.
