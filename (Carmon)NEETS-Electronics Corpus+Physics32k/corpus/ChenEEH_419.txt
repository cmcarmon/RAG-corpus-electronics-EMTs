Simple transconductors with bandwidths in the GHz range
have been designed in standard CMOS technology (Szczepanski
et al., 1997); in turn, they permit communication ﬁlters to
be designed with operating frequencies in the hundreds of
megahertz. There are several additional reasons for the popu-
larity of the use of transconductors in ﬁlter design. Among them
are the small OTA circuitry, the particularly easy ﬁlter design
techniques that normally permit all OTA cells to be identical,
and the compatibility with digital (CMOS) integrated-circuit
technology: ‘‘OTA-C’’ ﬁlters use no resistors.
