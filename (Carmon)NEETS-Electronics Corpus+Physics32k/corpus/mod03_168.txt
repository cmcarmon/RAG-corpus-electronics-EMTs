It always takes the same amount of current to deflect the pointer to a certain position on the scale
(midscale position for example), regardless of the multiplication factor being used. Since the multiplier
resistors are of different values, it is necessary to ALWAYS "zero" adjust the meter for each
multiplication fact or selected.
