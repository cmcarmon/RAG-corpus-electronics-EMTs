which is a special case of Eq. (100.135). A variety of procedures has been proposed for sketching state [phase]
plane trajectories for Eqs. (100.135) and (100.137). A complete plot showing trajectory motions throughout
the  entire  state  (phase)  plane  is  known  as  a  state  (phase)  portrait.  Knowledge  of  these  methods,  despite  the
improvements in computation since they were originally proposed, can be particularly helpful for obtaining
an appreciation of the system behavior. When simulation studies are undertaken, phase plane graphs are easily
obtained and they are often more helpful for understanding the system behavior than displays of the variables
x1 and x2 against time.
