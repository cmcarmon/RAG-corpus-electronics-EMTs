Comparison of Digital Communication Systems
The noise performances of different digital communication systems are usually compared on the
basis of their bit-error probabilities Pe. Keeping the ratio Eb/N0 as an independent parameter,
where Eb represents the average signal energy per bit and N0 stands for the noise level, the
following expressions are given here with no derivation:
