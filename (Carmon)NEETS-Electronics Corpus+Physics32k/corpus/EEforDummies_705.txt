Packaging is everything
Great things really do come in small packages. Many ICs that can fit in the 
palm of your hand contain incredibly complex circuitry; for example, an entire 
AM/FM radio circuit (minus the battery and antenna) fits in an IC package 
the size of a nickel. The actual circuit is so small that manufacturers have to 
mount it onto a reasonable‚Äêsize plastic or ceramic package so humans can use 
it. During the process of chip assembly, leads are attached to the appropriate 
circuit access points and fed out of the package enclosure so you and others 
like you can get current flowing to, through, and from the circuit inside.
