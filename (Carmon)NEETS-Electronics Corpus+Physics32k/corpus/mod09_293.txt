The major difference between the LC and RC oscillator is that the frequency-determining device in 
the RC oscillator is not a tank circuit. Remember, the LC oscillator can operate with class A or C biasing 
because of the oscillator action of the resonant tank. The RC oscillator, however, must use class A biasing 
because the RC frequency-determining device doesn't have the oscillating ability of a tank circuit.
