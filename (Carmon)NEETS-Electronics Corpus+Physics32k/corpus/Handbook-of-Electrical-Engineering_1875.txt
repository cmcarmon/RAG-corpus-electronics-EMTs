Vector  units  allow  linear  algebra  to  be  performed  at  very  high  speeds  with  high  hardware  utilization.
Furthermore,  because  they  have  a  long  history  in  scientiﬁc  computing,  compiling  high-level  languages  into
vector instructions is well understood. However, the latencies of integer arithmetic operations for video oper-
ations is smaller than that for the ﬂoating-point operations typically used in scientiﬁc vector processors.
