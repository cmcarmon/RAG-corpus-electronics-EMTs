As VDS is increased beyond VD, sat , the width of the pinch-
off region increases. However, the voltage that drops across the
inversion layer remains constant and equal to VD, sat . The
portion of the drain bias in excess of VD, sat appears across
the pinch-off region. In a long channel MOSFET, the width of
the pinch-off region is assumed small relative to the length
of the channel. Thus, neither the length nor the voltage across
the inversion layer change beyond the pinch-off, resulting in a
drain current independent of drain bias. Consequently, the
drain current saturates. In smaller devices, this assumption
falls apart and leads to channel length modulation, which is
discussed later in the chapter.
