Solid-state devices are generally used for VHF transmitters below 35 kW and for low-power UHF transmitters
(below 10 kW). Tetrodes may also be used in these ranges. As solid-state technology advances, the power levels
possible in a reasonable transmitter design steadily increase. In the realm of high power UHF transmitters, the
klystron  is  a  common  power  output  device.  Klystrons  use  an  electron  bunching  technique  to  generate  high
power  (55 kW  from  a  single  tube  is  not  uncommon)  at  microwave  frequencies.  The  klystron,  however,  is
relatively inefﬁcient in its basic form. A stock klystron with no efﬁciency-optimizing circuitry might be only
40  to  50%  efﬁcient,  depending  on  the  type  of  device  used.  Various  schemes  have  been  devised  to  improve
klystron efﬁciency, the best known of which is beam pulsing. Two types of pulsing are in common used:
