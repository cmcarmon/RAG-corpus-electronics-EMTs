Self-excited attractors can be localized numerically by the standard computational procedure, in which after a transient process a trajectory, started from a point of unstable manifold in a neighborhood of equilibrium, reaches a state of oscillation therefore one can easily identify it. Here It is essential to consider numerical localization procedures in forward and backward time, since computation in backward time may localize also an unstable oscillation.
Classical attractors in the well-known dynamical systems of Van der Pol, Beluosov–Zhabotinsky, Lorenz, Rössler, Chua and many others are self-excited attractors and can be obtained numerically, with relative ease, by standard computational procedures described above.
