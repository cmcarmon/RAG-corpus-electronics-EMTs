Adaptive, self-monitoring of well-being by a system that has an integrated set of smart devices to self-assess
its performance, diagnosing any malfunctions and failures and able to change its system characteristics vis-à-
vis the environment, has been the objective of the relevant seed research pursued until now. For example, self-
health checks by aircraft via a network of smart-skin sensors offer real-time monitoring of the structural well-
being of tomorrow’s aircraft [Claus, 1991]. The protocols in such efforts include self-diagnosis, prediction and
notiﬁcation, and self-repair strategies relevant to mechanical structures (such as aircraft bodies).
