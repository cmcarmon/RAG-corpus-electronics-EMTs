Thermodynamic potentials are different quantitative measures of the stored energy in a system. Potentials are used to measure the energy changes in systems as they evolve from an initial state to a final state. The potential used depends on the constraints of the system, such as constant temperature or pressure. For example, the Helmholtz and Gibbs energies are the energies available in a system to do useful work when the temperature and volume or the pressure and temperature are fixed, respectively.
The five most well known potentials are:
where



T


{\displaystyle T}
is the temperature,



S


{\displaystyle S}
the entropy,



p


{\displaystyle p}
the pressure,



V


{\displaystyle V}
the volume,



Î¼


{\displaystyle \mu }
the chemical potential,



N


{\displaystyle N}
the number of particles in the system, and



i


{\displaystyle i}
is the count of particles types in the system.
Thermodynamic potentials can be derived from the energy balance equation applied to a thermodynamic system. Other thermodynamic potentials can also be obtained through Legendre transformation.
