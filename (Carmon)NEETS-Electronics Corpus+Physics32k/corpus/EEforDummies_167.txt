As you set up the circuit on the 
breadboard, remember that it doesn’t 
matter how you orient the resistor, but be sure to orient the LED so that the 
shorter lead is connected to the negative side of the battery pack. If you clip 
the leads to make your circuit neater (as shown in Figure 3-9), remember to 
keep track of which lead was shorter to begin with. You use a short jumper 
wire in your trimmed circuit to connect the resistor to the LED. (In Chapter 9, 
you find out another way to identify which lead is which on an LED.)
