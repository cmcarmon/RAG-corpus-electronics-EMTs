Figure 1-25(A) shows two resistors connected in parallel. Notice that the voltage across both
resistors is equal. In figure 1-25(B) the same resistors are connected in series. In this case, the voltage
across the resistors is not equal. If R1 represents a voltmeter, the only way in which it can be connected to
measure the voltage of R2 is in parallel with R2, as in figure 1-25(A).
