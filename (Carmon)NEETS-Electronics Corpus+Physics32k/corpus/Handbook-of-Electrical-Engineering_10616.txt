Luminaires used for general lighting in medium-bay areas are nearly always of the direct or semi-direct type,
either ﬂuorescent or wide distribution HID. They may be the ventilated or nonventilated type and the lamps
may be shielded by louvers, bafﬂes, or other devices. For lower mounting, the trend is toward the semi-direct type.
Some of the visual tasks involve specular or semi-specular objects, for which optimum lighting might be an
indirect system. The quality of ﬂuorescent sources, with their broad distribution of light, makes them a prime
selection  for  medium-  and  low-bay  lighting.  When  the  proper  quality  control  can  be  attained,  low-wattage
HID sources are ﬁnding an increasing number of low-bay applications.
