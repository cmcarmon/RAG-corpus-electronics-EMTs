Three types of collisions have occurred involving artificial satellites orbiting the Earth:
Intentional collisions intended to destroy the satellites, either to test anti-satellite weapons or destroy satellites which may pose a hazard should they reenter the atmosphere intact:
Several tests conducted as part of the Soviet Union's Istrebitel Sputnik programme in the 1970s and 80s, involving IS-A satellites intercepting and destroying IS-P, DS-P1-M and Lira target satellites launched specifically for the tests.
The 1985 destruction of the USA P78-1 solar research satellite during a USA ASM-135 anti-satellite missile test.
The 2007 destruction of the Chinese Fungyun FY-1C weather satellite during a Chinese anti-satellite missile test.
The 2008 destruction of the USA-193 military reconnaissance satellite in a decaying orbit by a USA SM-3 missile.

Unintentional low-speed collisions during failed rendezvous and docking operations:
The 1994 collision between the manned Soyuz TM-17 spacecraft and the Russian Mir space station.
The 1997 low-speed collision between the Progress M-34 supply ship and the Russian Mir space station during manual docking manoeuvers.
The 2005 low-speed collision between the USA DART spacecraft and the USA MUBLCOM communications satellite during orbital rendezvous manoeuvers.

Unintentional high-speed collisions between active satellites and orbital debris:
The 1996 collision between the French Cerise military reconnaissance satellite and debris from an Ariane rocket.
The 2009 collision between the Iridium 33 communications satellite and the derelict Russian Kosmos 2251 spacecraft, which resulted in the destruction of both satellites.
The 22 January 2013 collision between debris from Fungyun FY-1C satellite and the Russian BLITS nano-satellite.
The 22 May 2013 collision between two CubeSats, Ecuador's NEE-01 Pegaso and Argentina's CubeBug-1, and the particles of a debris cloud around a Tsyklon-3 upper stage (SCN 15890) left over from the launch of Kosmos 1666.
