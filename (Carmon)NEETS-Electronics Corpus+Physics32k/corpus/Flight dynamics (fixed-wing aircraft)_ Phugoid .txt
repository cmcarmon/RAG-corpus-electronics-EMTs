If the stick is held fixed, the aircraft will not maintain straight and level flight, but will start to dive, level out and climb again. It will repeat this cycle until the pilot intervenes. This long period oscillation in speed and height is called the phugoid mode. This is analyzed by assuming that the SSPO performs its proper function and maintains the angle of attack near its nominal value. The two states which are mainly affected are the climb angle



γ


{\displaystyle \gamma }
(gamma) and speed. The small perturbation equations of motion are:




m
U



d
γ


d
t



=
−
Z


{\displaystyle mU{\frac {d\gamma }{dt}}=-Z}


which means the centripetal force is equal to the perturbation in lift force.
For the speed, resolving along the trajectory:

γ


{\displaystyle m{\frac {du}{dt}}=X-mg\gamma }


where g is the acceleration due to gravity at the earths surface. The acceleration along the trajectory is equal to the net x-wise force minus the component of weight. We should not expect significant aerodynamic derivatives to depend on the climb angle, so only

u




{\displaystyle X_{u}}
and




Z

{\displaystyle Z_{u}}
need be considered.




X

u




{\displaystyle X_{u}}
is the drag increment with increased speed, it is negative, likewise




Z

u




{\displaystyle Z_{u}}
is the lift increment due to speed increment, it is also negative because lift acts in the opposite sense to the z-axis.
The equations of motion become:

{\displaystyle S_{w}}
is the wing area, W the weight and




c

{\displaystyle c_{L}}
is the lift coefficient (assumed constant because the incidence is constant), we have, approximately:

{\displaystyle Z_{u}={\frac {2W}{U}}={\frac {2mg}{U}}}


The period of the phugoid, T, is obtained from the coefficient of u:

{\displaystyle T={\frac {2\pi U}{{\sqrt {2}}g}}}


Since the lift is very much greater than the drag, the phugoid is at best lightly damped. A propeller with fixed speed would help. Heavy damping of the pitch rotation or a large rotational inertia increase the coupling between short period and phugoid modes, so that these will modify the phugoid.
