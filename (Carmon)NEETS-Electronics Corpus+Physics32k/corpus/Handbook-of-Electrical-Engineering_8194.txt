4. Most  color  plasma  displays  have  inherent  memory  which  is  stored  directly  in  the  glass  plasma  panel.
Memory is very desirable for ﬂat panel displays because it allows the display to be very bright even for
very large sizes. This is because a display with memory has a pixel duty cycle of one. Displays without
memory have a pixel duty cycle of one divided by the number of scanned lines. Thus, as the non-memory
displays get bigger and the number of scanned lines increases, the duty cycle and, therefore, the brightness
of the display decrease. An additional value of memory is the elimination of ﬂicker because the pixels
are on all of the time.
