The Navier–Stokes problem in two dimensions has already been solved positively since the 1960s: there exist smooth and globally defined solutions.
If the initial velocity




v

(
x
,
t
)


{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} (x,t)}
is sufficiently small then the statement is true: there are smooth and globally defined solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations.
Given an initial velocity





v


0


(
x
)


{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{0}(x)}
there exists a finite time T, depending on





v


0


(
x
)


{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{0}(x)}
such that the Navier–Stokes equations on





R


3


×
(
0
,
T
)


{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{3}\times (0,T)}
have smooth solutions




v

(
x
,
t
)


{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} (x,t)}
and



p
(
x
,
t
)


{\displaystyle p(x,t)}
. It is not known if the solutions exist beyond that "blowup time" T.
Jean Leray in 1934 proved the existence of so-called weak solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations, satisfying the equations in mean value, not pointwise.
Terence Tao in 2016 published a finite time blowup result for an averaged version of the 3-dimensional Navier–Stokes equation. He writes that the result formalizes a "supercriticality barrier" for the global regularity problem for the true Navier–Stokes equations, and claims that the method of proof in fact hints at a possible route to establishing blowup for the true equations.
