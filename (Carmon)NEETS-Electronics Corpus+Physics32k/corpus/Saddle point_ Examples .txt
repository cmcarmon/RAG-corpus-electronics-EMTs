In a two-player zero sum game defined on a continuous space, the equilibrium point is a saddle point.
For a second-order linear autonomous system, a critical point is a saddle point if the characteristic equation has one positive and one negative real eigenvalue.
In optimization subject to equality constraints, the first-order conditions describe a saddle point of the Lagrangian.
