the processor's response will depend upon whether 
interrupts  are  currently  enabled  or  disabled  (when 
enabled, the CPU will suspend its current task and 
carry out the requisite interrupt service routine).  
  The  response  to  interrupts  can  be  enabled  or 
disabled  by  means  of  appropriate  program 
instructions.  In  practice,  interrupt  signals  may  be 
generated from a number of sources and since each 
will  require 
its  own  customized  response  a 
mechanism  must  be  provided  for  identifying  the 
source  of  the  interrupt  and  calling  the  appropriate 
interrupt  service  routine.  In  order  to  assist  in  this 
task,  the  microprocessor  may  use  a  dedicated 
programmable interrupt controller chip.
