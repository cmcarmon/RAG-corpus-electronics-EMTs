Earlier efforts (after 1798) to determine Earth's mass involved measuring G directly as in the Cavendish experiment. Earth's mass could be then found by combining two equations; Newton's second law, and Newton's law of universal gravitation:




F
=
m
a
,

F
=
G



m

M

⊕




r

2




.


{\displaystyle F=ma,\quad F=G{\frac {mM_{\oplus }}{r^{2}}}.}

Substituting earth's gravity, g for the acceleration term, and combining the two equations gives




m
g
=
G



m

M

⊕




r

2






{\displaystyle mg=G{\frac {mM_{\oplus }}{r^{2}}}}
.
The equation can then be solved for M⊕





M

⊕


=



g

r

2



G


.


{\displaystyle M_{\oplus }={\frac {gr^{2}}{G}}.}

With this method, the values for Earth's surface gravity, Earth's radius, and G were measured empirically.
