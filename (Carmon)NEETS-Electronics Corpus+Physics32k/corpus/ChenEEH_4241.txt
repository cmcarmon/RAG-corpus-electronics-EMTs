Communicating Anytime, Anywhere, and in Any Mode
There seems to be a wide acceptance of the notion of being able
to communicate anywhere, anytime, and in any mode. Soft-
ware programmable radios allow a subscriber unit to adapt its
modulation, multiple-access method, and other characteristics
to be able to communicate with a wide range of different
systems and more efÔ¨Åciently support diverse voice, data,
image, and video requirements. Likewise, a single base station
unit will be able to adapt its characteristics to support older
generations of subscriber equipment while retaining the ability
to support future developments through software changes.
