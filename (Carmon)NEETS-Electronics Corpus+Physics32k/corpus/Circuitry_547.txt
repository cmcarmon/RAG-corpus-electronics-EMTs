the  microcontroller)  some  additional 
interface 
circuitry  may  be  required  in  order  to  shift  the 
voltage  levels  or  to  provide  additional  current 
drive.  Additional  circuitry  may  also  be  required 
when  a  load  (such  as  a  relay  or  motor)  requires 
more current than is available from a standard logic 
device  or  output  port.  For  example,  a  common 
range  of  interface  circuits  (solid-state  relays)  is 
available  that  will  allow  a  microcontroller  to  be 
easily interfaced to an AC mains-connected load. It 
then  becomes  possible  for  a  small  microcontroller 
(operating from only a 5 V DC supply) to control a 
central  heating  system  operating  from  240  V  AC 
mains.
