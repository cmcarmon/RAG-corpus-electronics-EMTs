where Ve is the volume of the core in cubic meters, f is the frequency, and B is the maximum ﬂux density in teslas.
As  the  magnetic  ﬁeld  reverses  direction  and  cuts  across  the  core  structure,  it  induces  a  voltage  in  the
laminations known as eddy voltages. This phenomenon causes eddy currents to circulate in the laminations.
The loss due to eddy currents is called the eddy current loss Pe :
