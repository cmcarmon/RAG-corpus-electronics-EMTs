The S-parameters fully describe the electrical properties of a
lumped or distributed microwave network. S-parameters can
be converted to and from other network parameter represen-
tations such as Y, Z, and ABCD matrices (Collin, 1992). The
ABCD (chain) matrix is popular in the analysis and design of
microwave circuits when the voltage and current concepts can
be applied. Smith chart techniques also provide a straightfor-
ward tool for most practical problems of design and analysis
(Collin, 1992).
