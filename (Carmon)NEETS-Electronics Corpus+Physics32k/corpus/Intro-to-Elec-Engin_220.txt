Notice that the magnitudes of the phasors are chosen for convenience to be the rms values of the
original functions (rather than the peak amplitudes), and angles are given by the argument of the
cosine function at t = 0. The student should observe that phasors are referenced here to cosine
functions. Therefore, the conversion of sine functions into equivalent cosine functions makes it
more convenient for expressing phasor representations of sine functions. The phasor volt-ampere
equations for R, L, and C are given by Equations (3.1.21) through (3.1.26), whereas the phasor
