Calculating the amount of power converted by an electrical device is a simple matter. You need to
know the length of time the device is operated and the input power or horsepower rating. Horsepower, a
unit of work, is often found as a rating on electrical motors. One horsepower is equal to 746 watts.
Example: A 3/4-hp motor operates 8 hours a day. How much power is converted by the motor per month?
How many kWh does this represent?
