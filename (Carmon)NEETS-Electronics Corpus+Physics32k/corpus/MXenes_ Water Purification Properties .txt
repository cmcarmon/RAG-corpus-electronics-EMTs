One-micron-thick Ti3C2 MXene membranes demonstrated ultrafast water flux (approximately 38 L/(Bar·h·m2) and differential sieving of salts depending on both the hydration radius and charge of the ions. Cations larger than the interlayer spacing of MXene don’t permeate through Ti3C2 membranes. As for smaller cations, the ones with a larger charge permeate an order of magnitude slower than single-charged cations.
