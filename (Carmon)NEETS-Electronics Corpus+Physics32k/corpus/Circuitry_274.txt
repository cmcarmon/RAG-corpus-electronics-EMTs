Transistor coding 
 
The  European  system  for  classifying  transistors 
involves  an  alphanumeric  code  which  employs 
either two letters and three figures (general-purpose 
transistors) or three letters and two figures (special-
purpose 
transistors).  Table  5.13  shows  how 
transistors are coded. 
 
Example 5.9 
 
Identify each of the following transistors: 
(a) AF115 
(b) BC109 
(c) BD135 
(d) BFY51.
