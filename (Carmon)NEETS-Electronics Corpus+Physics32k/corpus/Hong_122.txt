The  basic  feedback  loop  is  shown  in  Figure 10.1  where  the  output  of  a  system, 
described  by  the  transfer  function  A(ω),  is  multiplied  by  a  transfer  function  f(ω)  and 
subtracted from the input before being re-inputed into the system. The transfer function 
A(ω) is known as the open-loop response while the overall response of the feedback loop 
is known as the closed-loop response. The negative sign on the feedback loop is placed 
there  by  convention  since  a  majority  of  engineering  feedback  systems  use  negative 
feedback. Since both A and f are functions of frequency, ω, the overall response will also 
be a function of ω.
