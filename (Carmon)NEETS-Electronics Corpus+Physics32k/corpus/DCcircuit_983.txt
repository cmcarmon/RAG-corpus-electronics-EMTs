Note how the second term in the equation’s original form has resistor R4’s value of 300 Ω
multiplied by the difference between I2 and I3 (I2 - I3). This is how we represent the combined
effect of two mesh currents going in opposite directions through the same component. Choosing
the appropriate mathematical signs is very important here: 300(I2 - I3) does not mean the
same thing as 300(I3 - I2). I chose to write 300(I2 - I3) because I was thinking ﬁrst of I2’s effect
(creating a positive voltage drop, measuring with an imaginary voltmeter across R4, red lead
on the bottom and black lead on the top), and secondarily of I3’s effect (creating a negative
voltage drop, red lead on the bottom and black lead on the top). If I had thought in terms of
I3’s effect ﬁrst and I2’s effect secondarily, holding my imaginary voltmeter leads in the same
positions (red on bottom and black on top), the expression would have been -300(I3 - I2). Note
that this expression is mathematically equivalent to the ﬁrst one: +300(I2 - I3).
