Programmable  logic  is  a  fast-moving  ﬁeld,  with  many  vendors  continually  introducing  new  devices  and
improved versions of existing architectures. The magazines Electronic Design, EDN, and Computer Design carry
regular announcements of new programmable logic hardware and software products and often print articles
illustrating applications and design methods. All of the vendors publish application notes which are the best
source of device-speciﬁc design information.
