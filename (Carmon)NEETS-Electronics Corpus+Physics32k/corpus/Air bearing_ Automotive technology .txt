Air-guided high-frequency knife drive
Even for movements which cause damage due to disruptive wear with roller bearings, lifetimes of the drive systems are unlimited.
Air-guided turbo charger
In order to provide confidence and for the first investigations, an initial conversion from a conventional oil-guided turbo charger into air-guided was done. For a real future version, the use of results obtained from high-temperature solutions, mass products (proved production costs) and high-frequency spindles (know-how of dynamic background) will be very helpful.
