Intermodulation Distortion
The  previous  sections  have  examined  the  effect  of  nonlinear  device  characteristics  when  a  single-frequency
sinusoidal signal is applied at the input. However, if there are two or more sinusoidal inputs, then the nonlin-
earity  results  in  not  only  the  fundamental  and  harmonics  but  also  additional  frequencies  called  the  beat
frequencies at the output. The distortion due to the components at the beat frequencies is called intermodulation
distortion. To characterize this type of distortion consider the incremental output given by Eq. (5.10) and the
input signal to be
