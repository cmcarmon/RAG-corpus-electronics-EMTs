In Guatemala, a cuerda is a traditional unit of distance, equal to exactly 25 varas or almost 21 meters (nearly 69 feet).
During 19th-century Spain, a cuerda was a unit of length, of nearly 6.889 m (approx. 7.554 yd). However, in Valencia, Spain, the cuerda measured 40 varas, over 5.4 times longer, as nearly 37.21 m (approx. 40.7 yd).
