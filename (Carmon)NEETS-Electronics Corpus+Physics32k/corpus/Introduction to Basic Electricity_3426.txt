The first integrated circuit was conceived by Geoffrey 
W. A. Dummer, a radar scientist for the Royal Radar 
Establishment of the British Ministry of Defense. He 
published his idea in Washington, D.C., on May 7, 
1952. But by 1956, he had still failed to build a success-
ful circuit based on his model.
