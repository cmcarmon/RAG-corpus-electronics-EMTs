Another type of secondary cell is the nickel	cad-
mium	(ni-cad)	cell (Figure 12-17). This is a dry 
cell that can be recharged many times and can hold its 
charge for long periods of time. It consists of a positive 
and a negative electrode, a separator, an electrolyte, 
and a package. The electrodes are comprised of a de-
posit of powdered nickel on a nickel wire screen, which 
is coated with a nickel salt solution for the  positive 
electrode and a cadmium salt solution for a negative 
electrode. The separator is made of an  absorbent in-
sulating material. The electrolyte is potassium hydrox-
ide. A steel can forms the package and is sealed tightly. 
A typical voltage from this type of cell is 1.2Â volts.
