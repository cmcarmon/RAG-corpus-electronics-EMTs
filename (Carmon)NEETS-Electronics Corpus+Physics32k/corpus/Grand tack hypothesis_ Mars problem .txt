Jupiter's grand tack resolves the Mars problem by limiting the material available to form Mars. The Mars problem is a conflict between some simulations of the formation of the terrestrial planets, which when begun with planetesimals distributed throughout the inner Solar System, end with a 0.5â€“1.0 Earth-mass planet in its region, much larger than the actual mass of Mars, 0.107 Earth-mass. Jupiter's inward migration alters this distribution of material, driving planetesimals inward to form a narrow dense band with a mix of materials inside 1.0 AU, and leaving the Mars region largely empty. Planetary embryos quickly form in the narrow band. While most later collide and merge to form the larger terrestrial planets (Venus and Earth), some are scattered outside the band. These scattered embryos, deprived of additional material slowing their growth, form the lower mass terrestrial planets Mars and Mercury.
