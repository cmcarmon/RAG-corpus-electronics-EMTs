Phased Arrays
By adjusting the phase of the elements of the array it is possible to vary the direction of the maximum of the
array’s radiation pattern. For arrays where all the excitation currents are equal in magnitude but not necessarily
phase, the array factor is a maximum when y  = 0. From the deﬁnition of y, one can see that at the pattern
maximum
