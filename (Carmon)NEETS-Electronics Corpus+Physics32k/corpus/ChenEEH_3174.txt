insulators made from porcelain and glass are known to possess
extremely high resistance to heat from electrical discharge
activity in the form of arcs or sparks, corona, and chemicals
encountered during service. Their high stability is related to
the strong electrostatic bonds between the various atoms in the
material. This attribute also imparts a high value of surface
free energy, a thermodynamic quantity that determines the
strength of adhesion of the surface with water. In simple terms,
porcelain and glass are easily rendered wettable by water.
Hence, insulators made from these materials need to have
sufﬁcient leakage distance and complicated shapes to retain a
sufﬁciently high surface resistance under wet and contami-
nated conditions.
