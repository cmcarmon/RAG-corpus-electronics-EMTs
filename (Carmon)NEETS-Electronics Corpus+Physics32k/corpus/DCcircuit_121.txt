On a positive note (no pun intended), I have subsequently discovered that some students
prefer electron ﬂow notation when ﬁrst learning about the behavior of semiconductive sub-
stances. Also, the habit of visualizing electrons ﬂowing against the arrows of polarized device
symbols isn’t that difﬁcult to learn, and in the end I’ve found that I can follow the operation of
a circuit equally well using either mode of notation. Still, I sometimes wonder if it would all be
much easier if we went back to the source of the confusion – Ben Franklin’s errant conjecture
– and ﬁxed the problem there, calling electrons ”positive” and protons ”negative.”
