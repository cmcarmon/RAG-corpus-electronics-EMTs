{\displaystyle \mathbf {v_{2}} ={\frac {1}{f_{1}g_{3}-f_{3}g_{1}}}\left(-f_{3}\mathbf {r_{1}} +f_{1}\mathbf {r_{3}} \right)}

where
v2 is the velocity vector for the second observation of the orbiting body (in Equatorial Coordinate System)
f1, f3, g1 and g3 are the Lagrange coefficients
rn is the respective orbiting body position vector
