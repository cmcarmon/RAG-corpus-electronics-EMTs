As you can see, the circuit shown in figure 3-25 functions as a subtractor. But just as an adder is only
one kind of summing amplifier, a subtractor is only one kind of difference amplifier. A difference
amplifier can amplify the difference between two signals. For example, with two inputs (E1 and E2) and a
gain of five, a difference amplifier will produce an output signal which is:
