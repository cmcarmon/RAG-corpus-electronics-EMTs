and we have a representation of the connection function in
terms of the four L matrices even though the connection
function is nonlinear in Z. This matrix representation facili-
tates manipulation of the connection function as shown later
(Ransom, 1973, 1972; Saeks, 1970; Ransom and Saeks, 1973b,
1973a). The ﬁrst observation that the connection function
could be so represented was made by Saeks (1970), while the
ﬁrst exploitation of the concept is attributable to Ransom
(1973, 1972) and Saeks (1973b, 1973a).
