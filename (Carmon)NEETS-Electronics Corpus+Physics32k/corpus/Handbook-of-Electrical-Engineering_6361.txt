Audio Compression and Source Encoding
The  development  of  digital  audio  encoding  started  with  research  into  pulse-code  modulation  (PCM)  in  the
late  1930s  and  evolved,  shortly  thereafter,  to  include  work  on  the  principles  of  digital  PCM  coding.  Linear
predictive coding (LPC) and adaptive delta pulse-code modulation (ADPCM) algorithms had evolved in the
early 1970s and later were adopted into standards such as C.721 (published by the CCITT) and CD-I (Compact
Disc-Interactive). At the same time, algorithms were being invented for use with phoneme-based speech coding.
Phonetic coding, a ﬁrst-generation “model-based” speech-coding algorithm, was mainly implemented for low
bit-rate speech and text-to-speech applications. These classes of algorithms for speech further evolved to include
both CELP (Code Excited Linear Predictive) and VSELP (Vector Selectable Excited Linear Predictive) algorithms
by the mid-1980s. In the late 1980s, these classes of algorithms were also shown to be useful for high-quality
audio music coding. These audio algorithms were put to commercial use from the late 1970s to the latter part
of the 1980s.
