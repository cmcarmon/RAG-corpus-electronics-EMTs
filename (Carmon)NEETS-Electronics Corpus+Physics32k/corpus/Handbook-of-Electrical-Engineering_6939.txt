Finally, let X(t) be uncorrelated (E[X(t)X(t + t)] = 0 for t not zero) such that each rv X(t) = Xt is Gaussian
with zero mean and variance s2(t) = t, for all t > 0. Any realized sample function x(t) of X(t) cannot be predicted
in  any  average  sense  based  on  past  values  (uncorrelated  Gaussian  random  variables  are  independent).  The
variance  grows  in  an  unbounded  manner  over  time,  so  X(t)  is  neither  stationary  nor  deterministic.  This  is
called the Wiener process.
