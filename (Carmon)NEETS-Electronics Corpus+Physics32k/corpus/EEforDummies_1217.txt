Look at the circuit in Figure 17-3. Other than the additional LEDs at the 
output of the 555 timer IC and the use of a fixed resistor instead of a poten-
tiometer for R1, this circuit seems identical to the simple LED flasher circuit 
from the previous section. And it is. Well, except for the values of R1, R2, and 
C1, which are the components that determine the pulse rate that controls the 
blinking of the LEDs.
