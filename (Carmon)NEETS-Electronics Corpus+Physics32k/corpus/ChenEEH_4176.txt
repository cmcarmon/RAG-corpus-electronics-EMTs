. Two coordinated parity checking: The scheme checks for
the parities for a block of characters and not just for a
single character. The parities are added horizontally and
vertically within a block of characters to produce a block
check character (BCC). BCC is appended to the end of a
block to be transmitted. Table 5.1 illustrates the error
detection scheme. Assume that odd parity checking is
used.
