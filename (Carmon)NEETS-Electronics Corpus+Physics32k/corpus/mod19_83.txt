In cases of severe hemorrhage, do not worry too much about the dangers of infection. The basic 
problem is to stop the flow of blood. If no material is available, simply apply pressure with your bare 
hand. Remember, DIRECT PRESSURE is the first method to use when you are trying to control 
hemorrhage.
