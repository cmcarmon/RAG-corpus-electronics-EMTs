First, memories must be allocated: a number of memories is
chosen from the available memory types and the different port
conÔ¨Ågurations, different types are possibly mixed with each
other, and some memories may be multiported. The dimen-
sions of the memories are however only determined in the
second stage. When arrays are assigned to memories, their sizes
can be added up and the maximum bit width can be taken to
determine the required size and bit width of the memory. With
this decision, the memory organization is fully determined.
