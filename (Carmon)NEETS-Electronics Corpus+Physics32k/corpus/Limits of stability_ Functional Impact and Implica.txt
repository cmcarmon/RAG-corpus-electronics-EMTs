The capability of moving around without falling is necessary for activities of daily living (ADL's).Instability during weight-shifting activities, or the inability to perform certain weight transfer tasks such as bending forward to take objects from a shelf, leaning backward to rinse hair in the shower, etc. can result from a restricted LoS boundary. The ability to voluntarily move the COG to positions within the Limits of Stability (LOS) with control is fundamental to independence and safety in mobility tasks such as reaching for objects, transitioning from seated to standing positions (or standing to seated) and walking. The LoS can be indicative of fall risks in the elderly, individuals with movement disorders and in neurologically impaired populations.
