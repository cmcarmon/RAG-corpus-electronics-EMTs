This example also illustrates the impact a lowpass ﬁlter can have on a waveform. The simple RC ﬁlter used
here has a rather gradual frequency response, which means that higher harmonics are smoothly suppressed.
Later, we will describe ﬁlters that have much more rapidly varying frequency responses, allowing a much
more dramatic selection of the input’s Fourier coeﬃcients.
