ISO 21940 classifies vibration in terms of G codes. Unfortunately, it is the theoretical value assuming the rotor was spinning in free space so it does not relate to actual operating conditions. Rotors of the same type having permissible residual specific unbalance value eper, varies inversely with the speed of the rotor.
eper x ω = Constant,
where ω = angular velocity. eper = permissible residual specific unbalance
This constant is quality grade G. Balance Grades are used to specify the allowable residual imbalance for rotating machinery. The ISO 1940 standard defines balance grades for different classes of machinery. A rotor balanced to G2.5 will vibrate at 2.5 mm/s at operating speed if rotating in a suspended state with no external influences.
Uper = (9.54* G number * mass)/Rpm
Where Uper = balance tolerance (or) residual imbalance
