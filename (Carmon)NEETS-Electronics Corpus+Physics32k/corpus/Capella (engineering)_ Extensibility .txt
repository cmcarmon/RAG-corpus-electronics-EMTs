The workbench can be enhanced or specialized for a given business need, according to the concept of "Point of View", defined by the standard ISO/IEC 42010. These extensions provide, for example:
The ability to manage new information specific to a particular engineering need with its associated tooling. For example, non-functional properties such as time constraints for performance analysis, or constraints related to safety or security, cost of component for cost analysis, mass, etc. ;
The ability to specify the engineering approach with various architectural styles;
The ability to add new features to the workbench, such as a documentation export or a specialization of the transition system / subsystem mechanism.
