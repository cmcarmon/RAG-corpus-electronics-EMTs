One solar mass, M☉, can be converted to related units:
27068510 ML (Lunar mass)
332946 M⊕ (Earth mass)
1047.56 MJ (Jupiter mass)
1988.55 yottatonnes
It is also frequently useful in general relativity to express mass in units of length or time.
M☉ G / c2 ≈ 1.48 km (half the Schwarzschild radius of the Sun)
M☉ G / c3 ≈ 4.93 μs
