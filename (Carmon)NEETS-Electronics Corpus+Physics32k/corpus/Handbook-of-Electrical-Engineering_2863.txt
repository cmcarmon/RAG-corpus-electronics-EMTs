Adhesive  can  be  applied  by  screening  techniques  similar  to  solder  paste  screen  application,  by  pin  transfer
techniques, and by syringe deposition. Screen and pin-transfer techniques are suitable for high-volume production
lines with few product changes over time. Syringe deposition using an Xâ€“Y table riding over the board with a
volumetric pump and syringe tip is more suitable for lines with a varying product mix, prototype lines, and low-
volume lines where the open containers of adhesive necessary in pin-transfer and screen techniques are avoided.
Newer syringe systems are capable of handling high-volume lines. See Fig. 26.8 for methods of adhesive deposition.
If Type II or Type III assemblies are used, and thermal transfer between components and the substrate is a
