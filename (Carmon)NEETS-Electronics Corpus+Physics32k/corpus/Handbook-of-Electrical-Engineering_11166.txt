A special class of sensors of biological molecules has evolved in recent years. These bioanalytical sensors take
advantage  of  one  of  the  following  biochemical  reactions:  (1)  enzyme-substrate,  (2) antigen-antibody,  or  (3)
ligand-receptor. The advantage of using these reactions in a sensor is that they are highly speciﬁc for a particular
biological molecule, and sensors with high sensitivity can be developed based upon these reactions. The basic
structure of a bioanalytical sensor is shown in Fig. 114.5. There are two principal portions of the sensor. The
ﬁrst contains one component of the biological sensing reaction such as the enzyme or the antibody, and the
second component involves a means of detecting whether the biological reaction has taken place. This second
portion of a bioanalytical sensor is made up of either a physical or chemical sensor that serves as the detector
