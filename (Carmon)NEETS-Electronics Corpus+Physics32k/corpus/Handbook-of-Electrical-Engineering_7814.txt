Collimation and Beam Shaping
Since  the  cross-sectional  area  of  the  active  region  in  a  laser
diode is only about one micrometer, diffraction effects cause
the  emerging  beam  to  diverge  rapidly.  This  phenomenon  is
depicted  schematically  in  Fig. 80.24(a).  In  practical  applica-
tions of the laser diode, the expansion of the emerging beam
is  arrested  by  a  collimating  lens,  such  as  that  shown  in
Fig. 80.24(b). If the beam happens to have aberrations (astig-
matism is particularly severe in diode lasers), then the colli-
mating lens must be designed to correct this defect as well.
