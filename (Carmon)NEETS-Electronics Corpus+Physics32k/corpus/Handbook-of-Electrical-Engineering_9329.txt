The  term  top-down  design  (also  called  step-wise  reﬁnement)  is  frequently  misunderstood  as  exclusively
describing the method of design rather than the structure of the ﬁnished product. However, the creative process
of designing software (or anything else) frequently proceeds in a rather erratic fashion, and there is no fault in
this as long as the ﬁnal product through analyses and reorganizations has a simple hierarchical structure. This
is not to say that the process of design should not be guided by a top-down analysis; however, neither should
a programmer’s creativity be hampered by the straightjacket of a formalistic design principle, nor can a poorly
designed program be defended with reference to the superior (top-down design) method used for its creation.
