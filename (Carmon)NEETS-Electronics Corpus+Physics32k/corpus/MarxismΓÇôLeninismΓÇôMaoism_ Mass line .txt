Building on the theory of the vanguard party by Vladimir Lenin, the theory of the mass line outlines a strategy for the mass popularisation of revolutionary ideology, consolidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat and strengthening of the party and for the building of socialism. The mass line can be summarised by the phrase "from the masses, to the masses". It has three components (or stages), as follows:
Gathering the diverse ideas of the masses.
Processing or concentrating these ideas from the perspective of revolutionary Marxism, in light of the long-term, ultimate interests of the masses (which the masses themselves may sometimes only dimly perceive) and in light of a scientific analysis of the objective situation.
Returning these concentrated ideas to the masses in the form of a political line which will actually advance the mass struggle toward revolution.
These three steps should be applied over and over again, reiteratively uplifting practice and knowledge to higher and higher stages.
