One	of	the	privileges	that	reverse	engineering	can	grant	to	a	circuit	creator	is	the
guarantee	that	a	device	is	made	accordingly.	In	the	event	that	he	chooses	to	base
his	circuit	project	on	another	circuit	that	was	created	with	questionable	privacy,	he
can	determine	any	unethical	practices.	If	he	takes	apart	all	of	its	components,	he
has	the	chance	to	have	an	insider	look;	by	then,	he	can	confirm	whether
unregulated	modifications	are	in	place.
Why	use	reverse	engineering	techniques	for	circuit-creation:
