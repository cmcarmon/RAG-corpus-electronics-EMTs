RED and BLACK are used on patch panels to identify whether that panel is used for passing secure 
or nonsecure information. Red indicates that secure (encrypted) information is being passed through the 
panel. Black indicates that nonsecure (unencrypted) information is being passed. Patch panels through 
which secure information is passed are indicated by a red sign on the front that has inch high white block 
letters that say "RED PATCH PANEL." Panels through which nonsecure information is passed are 
indicated by two black signs on the front with inch high white block letters. One sign says "BLACK 
PATCH PANEL" and the other "UNCLAS ONLY."
