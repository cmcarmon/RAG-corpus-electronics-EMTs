Details of application of coatings to ceramic insulators are
partially covered in the IEEE Standard 957. Important aspects
are insulator cleaning, coating preparation, and details of
equipment to be used for application of the coating. The inter-
ested reader is referred to the documents listed in the reference
section. Proper adhesion of the coating to the ceramic surface is
critical for successful operation of the coated insulators.
