If a projectile, such as a baseball or cricket ball, travels in a parabolic path, with negligible air resistance, and if a player is positioned so as to catch it as it descends, he sees its angle of elevation increasing continuously throughout its flight. The tangent of the angle of elevation is proportional to the time since the ball was sent into the air, usually by being struck with a bat. Even when the ball is really descending, near the end of its flight, its angle of elevation seen by the player continues to increase. The player therefore sees it in line with a point ascending vertically from the batsman at constant speed. Finding the place from which the ball appears to rise steadily helps the player to position himself correctly to make the catch. If he is too close to the batsman who has hit the ball, it will appear to rise at an accelerating rate. If he is too far from the batsman, it will appear to slow rapidly, and then to descend.
Proof
Suppose the ball starts with a vertical component of velocity of vy upward, and a horizontal component of velocity of vx toward the player who wants to catch it. Its altitude above the ground is given by:




h
=

v

y

,


{\displaystyle h=v_{y}t-{\frac {1}{2}}gt^{2},}
where t is the time since the ball was hit.
The total time for the flight, until the ball is back down to the ground,



h
=
0


{\displaystyle h=0}
, is given by:




∴
T

{\displaystyle \therefore T={\frac {2v_{y}}{g}}.}

The horizontal component of the distance the ball travels from its starting point to time t

{\displaystyle (0\leq t\leq T)}
is




d

{\displaystyle d=v_{x}t}

The total horizontal distance the ball travels from its starting point to the point where it is caught is:




D

{\displaystyle D=d(T)={\frac {2v_{x}v_{y}}{g}}}

The horizontal component of the ball's distance from the catcher at time t is:

The tangent of the angle of elevation of the ball, as seen by the catcher, is:

The bracket in this last expression is constant for a given flight. Therefore, the tangent of the angle of elevation of the ball, as seen by the player who is properly positioned to catch it, is directly proportional to the time since the ball was hit.
