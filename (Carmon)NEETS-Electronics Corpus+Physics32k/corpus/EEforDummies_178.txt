relative measurement because itâ€™s the force that results from a difference 
in charge from one point to another. The voltage supplied by a battery rep-
resents the difference in charge from the positive terminal to the negative 
terminal, and that difference in charge has the potential to move current 
through a circuit; the circuit, in turn, absorbs the energy generated by that 
force as the current flows, which drops the voltage. No wonder voltage is 
sometimes called voltage drop, potential difference, or potential drop.
