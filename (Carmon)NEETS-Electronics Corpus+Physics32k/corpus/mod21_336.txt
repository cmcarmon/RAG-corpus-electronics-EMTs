Basically, the bridge is balanced with a known capacitance under short-circuit conditions. The 
unknown impedance is then inserted in lieu of the short bus, and the bridge is rebalanced. The difference 
between the known impedance under short-circuit conditions and the balance measurements obtained 
with the unknown impedance inserted in lieu of the short is the value of the unknown impedance.
