. A cell is a block of ﬁxed length, which consists of a
5-octet cell header and a 48-octet cell payload (see Fig. 72.1). The cell header contains all necessary information
for transferring the cell through the network and the cell payload includes the user information. The cell rate
of  a  connection  is  proportional  to  the  service  bit  rate.  Only  if  information  is  available  is  a  cell  used  by  the
connection. By having different routing labels, cells of different connections can be transported on the same
transmission  line  (cell  multiplexing).  If  no  connection  has  information  ready  to  transport,  idle  cells  will  be
inserted. Idle cells do not belong to any connection; they are identiﬁed by a standardized cell header.
