Equilibrant force is a force which brings equilibrium state. It is considered to be the equal and opposite of the resultant force. Equilibrant force is the force, which keeps any object motionless and acts on virtually every object in the world that is not moving. This term was first used in the 1800s to indicate counterbalancing a force system.
