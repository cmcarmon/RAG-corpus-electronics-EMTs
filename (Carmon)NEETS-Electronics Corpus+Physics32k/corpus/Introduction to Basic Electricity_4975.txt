When digital logic or other designs that use high-
pin-count chips are used, two trace layers are required. 
Digital IC chips with a large number of pins are impos-
sible to connect to other chips with a different layout 
without crossing and shorting the traces. Therefore, a 
second layer is required. In theory, only two layers are 
ever necessary with high-pin-count components.
