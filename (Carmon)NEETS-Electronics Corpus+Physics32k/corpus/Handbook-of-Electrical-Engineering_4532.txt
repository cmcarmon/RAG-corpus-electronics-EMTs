to approximate the integral. Other kinds of polynomials and function sampling can be used, as discussed in a
large volume of literature, some examples of which are Abramowitz and Stegun [1964], Acton [1970], and Press
et al. [1986]. It is interesting to see that numerical differentiation and integration can be accomplished using
the same set of function samples and spacings, differing only in the signs and values of some of the associated
weights. Note also that the added degrees of freedom that arise when the function samples can be unevenly
spaced, as in Gaussian quadrature, produce a generally more accurate result (for well-behaved functions) for
