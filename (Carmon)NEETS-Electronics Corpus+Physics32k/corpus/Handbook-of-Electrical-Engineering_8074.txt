In  a  hypercube  network,  N  microprocessors  are  arranged  in  an  n-dimensional  cube,  where  N  =  2n.  Each
processor is connected to n other processors and the longest communications path from any processor to any
other  is  n  links.  For  example,  a  three-dimensional  hypercube  contains  eight  processors  and  is  arranged  as  a
standard cube, where the nodes are the processors and the edges of the cube are the communication paths.
