Over the years, HLLs evolved into a ﬁeld of study of their own,
ﬁnding useful applications in all areas of computing. Some HLLs
are designed strictly for solving numerical problems, and some for symbolic problems. Other HLLs are designed
to control the operation of the computer itself, and yet even more novel languages have been devised to describe
the  construction  of  computer  hardware.  The  number  of  human-crafted  languages  has  multiplied  into  the
hundreds, leading to highly special-purpose HLLs.
