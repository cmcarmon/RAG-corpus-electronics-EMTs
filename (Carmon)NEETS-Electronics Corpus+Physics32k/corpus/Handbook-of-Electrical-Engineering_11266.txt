To ﬁrst obtain an ECG the patient must be physically connected to the ampliﬁer front end. The patient/ampli-
ﬁer interface is formed by a special bioelectrode which converts the ionic current ﬂow of the body to the electron
ﬂow of the metallic wire. These electrodes typically rely on a chemical paste or gel with a high ionic concen-
tration. This acts as the transducer at the tissue-electrode interface. For short-term applications silver-coated
suction electrodes or “sticky” metallic foil electrodes are used. Long-term recordings, such as the case for the
monitored patient, require a stable electrode/tissue interface and special adhesive tape material surrounds the
gel and a Ag+/Ag+Cl electrode.
