Practical Considerations in the Use of the HMM
Features
Thus far, we have discussed the HMM in principally abstract
terms. Here, we brieﬂy consider some of the practical aspects
of the use of the HMM, turning ﬁrst to the fundamental
acoustical analysis. Many features have been used as observa-
tions, but the most prevalent are the LP parameters, cepstral
parameters, and related quantities. These are frequently sup-
plemented by short-term time differences that capture the
dynamics of the signal as well as supplemented by energy
measures, such as short-term energy and differenced energy.
A comparative discussion is found in Bocchieri and Dodding-
ton (1986) and Nocerino et al. (1985).
