SINGLE MODE andMULTIMODE FIBERS are classified by the number of modes that
propagate along the optical fiber. Single mode fibers propagate only one mode because the core size
approaches the operational wavelength. Multimode fibers can propagate over 100 modes depending on
the core size and numerical aperture.
