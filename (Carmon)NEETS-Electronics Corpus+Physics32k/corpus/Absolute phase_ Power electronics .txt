When dealing with power electronics, the phase of the voltage and current at various points in the system relative to one another are important. If the points of interest are widely separated in space, it can be difficult to measure the relative phase. To solve this problem, the phase of the signals relative to absolute time (UTC) is measured using instruments relying on GPS. Comparison of two absolute phases in this sense allows the relative phase of distant signals to be computed.
