For deceleration straight ahead, where turning or maneuvering are not required, one technique is to simply accept a skid and lock up the brakes. While ABS or ESC brake systems may perform better, and reduce risk of loss of control, many less skilled drivers will stop faster while locked up than any alternative they can realistically perform. This is not true if the vehicle has to be steered while stopping.
