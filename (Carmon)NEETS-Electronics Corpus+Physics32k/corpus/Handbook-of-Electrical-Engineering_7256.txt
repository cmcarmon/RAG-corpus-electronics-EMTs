LAN Workgroup Sizes
Respondents were asked as to where a wireless offering might be Ô¨Årst installed. The market research indicated
that approximately 70% of the installations would contain less than 30 users (see Fig. 75.6). Furthermore, the
average  LAN  appeared  to  be  in  the  12-  to-15-node  range.  This  is  further  corroborated  by  the  KPMG  Peat
Marwick study which found that the average LAN size is about 15 users per LAN.
