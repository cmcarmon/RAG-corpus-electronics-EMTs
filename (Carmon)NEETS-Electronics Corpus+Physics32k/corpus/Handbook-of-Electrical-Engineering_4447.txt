As illustrated in Fig. 43.8, there are many types of mixers: one diode (single ended), two diodes (balanced
or antiparallel), four diodes (double balanced), and eight diodes (double-double balanced). Mixers can also be
realized using the nonlinearities associated with transistors that provide conversion gain. The most commonly
used  mixer  conÔ¨Åguration  in  the  microwave  frequency  band  is  the  double-balanced  mixer,  which  has  better
isolation between the ports and better spurious response. However, the single and balanced mixers place lower
power requirements on the local oscillator and have lower conversion loss.
