The most unfavorable condition for making a measurement occurs when the resistance, capacitance, 
or inductance to be measured is completely unknown. In these cases, the galvanometer cannot be 
protected by setting the bridge arms for approximate balance. To reduce the possibility of damage to the 
galvanometer, you should use an adjustable shunt circuit across the meter terminals. As the bridge is 
brought closer to the balanced condition, the resistance of the shunt can be increased; when the bridge is 
in balance, the meter shunt can be removed to obtain maximum detector sensitivity.
