The algorithm described above is only one of a large class of similar adaptive dictionary-based algorithms,
which are all rather loosely called Lempel–Ziv. These algorithms are simple and fast and have been implemented
in both software and hardware, e.g., in the compress command in UNIX and the PKZIP command on PCs. On
ASCII  text  ﬁles,  the  Lempel–Ziv  algorithm  achieves  compressions  on  the  order  of  50%.  It  has  also  been
implemented in hardware and has been used to “double” the capacity of data storage media or to “double” the
effective transmission rate of a modem. Many variations on the basic algorithm can be found in Bell et al. [1990].
