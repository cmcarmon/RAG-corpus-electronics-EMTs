*15.2.1 Find the number of possible station frequencies in
the AM broadcast system in the United States.
15.2.2 Let a(t ) = [1 + mAx(t )] and x(t ) = cos 2πfmt,
fm << fc, and xc(t ) = A(t ) cos 2πfct.
(a) With mA= 1, sketch one full period of the AM
wave and draw the envelope by connecting the
positive peaks of xc(t).
(b) Repeat part (a) with mA = 2, and notice that
the carrier is overmodulated and the envelope
does not have the same shape as x(t).
