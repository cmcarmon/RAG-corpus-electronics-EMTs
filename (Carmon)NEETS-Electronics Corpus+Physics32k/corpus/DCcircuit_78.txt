Voltage can be generated by means other than rubbing certain types of materials against
each other. Chemical reactions, radiant energy, and the inﬂuence of magnetism on conductors
are a few ways in which voltage may be produced. Respective examples of these three sources
of voltage are batteries, solar cells, and generators (such as the ”alternator” unit under the
hood of your automobile). For now, we won’t go into detail as to how each of these voltage
sources works – more important is that we understand how voltage sources can be applied to
create electron ﬂow in a circuit.
