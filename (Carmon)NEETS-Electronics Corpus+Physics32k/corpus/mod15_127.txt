As we previously explained, the differential receiver differs chiefly from the differential transmitter 
in its application. The TDX in each of the previous examples combined its own input with the signal from 
a synchro transmitter (TX) and transmitted the sum or difference to a synchro receiver (TR). The synchro 
receiver then provided the system's mechanical output. When the differential receiver (TDR) is used, the 
TDR itself provides the system's mechanical output. This output is usually the sum or difference of the 
electrical signals received from two synchro transmitters. Figure 1-22 shows a system consisting of two 
TXs (No. 1 and No. 2) and a TDR connected for subtraction.
