Pipelining: A technique to increase throughput. A long task is divided into components, and each component
is  distributed  to  one  processor.  A  new  task  can  begin  even  though  the  former  tasks  have  not  been
completed. In the pipelined operation, different components of different tasks are executed at the same
time by different processors. Pipelining leads to an increase in the system latency, i.e., the time elapsed
between the starting of a task and the completion of the task.
