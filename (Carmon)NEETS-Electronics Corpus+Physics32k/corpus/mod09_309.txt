A quartz crystal and its equivalent circuit are shown in figure 2-20, views (A) and (B). Capacitor C2, 
inductor L1, and resistor R1 in view (B) represent the electrical equivalent of the quartz crystal in view 
(A). Capacitance C1 in (view B) represents the capacitance between the crystal electrodes in view (A). 
Depending upon the circuit characteristics, the crystal can act as a capacitor, an inductor, a series-tuned 
circuit, or a parallel-tuned circuit.
