*12.4.19 An elementary two-pole rotating machine with
uniform air gap, as shown in Figure E12.4.1, has
a stator-winding self-inductance Lss of 50 mH, a
rotor-winding self-inductance Lrr of 50 mH, and
a maximum mutual inductance L of 45 mH. If the
stator were excited from a 60-Hz source, and the
rotor were excited from a 25-Hz source, at what
speed or speeds would the machine be capable of
converting energy?
