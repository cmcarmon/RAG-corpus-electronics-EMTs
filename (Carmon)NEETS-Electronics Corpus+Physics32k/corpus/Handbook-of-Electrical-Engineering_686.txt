Time Shift
The signal x(t – t0) is said to be a version of the signal x(t) right shifted (or delayed) by t0 seconds. Right shifting
(delaying) a signal by a t0 second duration in the time domain is seen to correspond to a multiplication by e –s t 0
in the Laplace transform domain. The desired Laplace transform relationship is
