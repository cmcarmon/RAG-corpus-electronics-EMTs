Because a hexahedra has eight nodes it is natural to select a bilinear trial function with eight parameters; see

the solution values at the nodes. The ﬁnite elements can be integrated into a numerical model for the whole
problem space either by (a) the variational method in which the total energy of the system is expressed in terms
of the ﬁnite element trial functions and then minimized to determine the best solution or (b) the weighted
residual method in which the formal error (residual), arising by substituting the trial functions into the deﬁning
equation, is weighted by a suitably chosen function and then integrated over the problem domain. The best ﬁt
for the trial function parameters can then be obtained by equating the integral to zero. Both methods lead to
a set of algebraic equations and are equivalent if the weighting functions are chosen to be the trial functions
(Galerkin’s method [Zienkiewicz, 1990]). At the element level, the residual
