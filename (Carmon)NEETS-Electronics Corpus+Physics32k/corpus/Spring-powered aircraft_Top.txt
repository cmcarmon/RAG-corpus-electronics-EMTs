A Spring-powered aircraft is an aircraft propulsed by a mechanical device capable of storing energy. The most popular version of a spring-powered aircraft are model toy planes driven by a rubber cord, which is twisted by turning the propellor. When leaving the hand from the propellor, it starts rotating and drives the plane. Most planes of this type have to be thrown by the operator, but some can start directly from the ground.
