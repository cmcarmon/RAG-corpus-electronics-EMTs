The  stabilization  of  component  temperature  and  minimization  of  the  temperature  differences  between
adjacent devices, components, and various packaging levels have long been known to reduce failure rates in
electronic systems [Hilbert and Kube, 1969]. In layered structures, such as chip packages and printed circuit
boards, and in the joints of surface mounted components, temperature nonuniformities, in all but the most
clever  designs,  accentuate  the  differences  in  the  thermal  expansion  coefﬁcients  among  the  various  materials
and can frequently result in thermal stresses that threaten the integrity of these components and joints [Engle-
mier, 1984; Suhir, 1988]. The growing integration on a single chip of functionally distinct and thermally diverse
devices, as in the power-integrated chips of the late 1980s and in the microsensor, RF, and in optoelectronic
chips under development today, can be expected to focus renewed attention on the minimization of transient
temperature and stress ﬁelds produced by localized heat sources.
