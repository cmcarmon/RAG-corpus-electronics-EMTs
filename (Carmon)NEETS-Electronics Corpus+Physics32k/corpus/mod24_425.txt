Fiber optic couplers should prevent the transfer of optical power from one input fiber to another
input fiber. Directional couplers are fiber optic couplers that prevent this transfer of power between input
fibers. Many fiber optic couplers are also symmetrical. A symmetrical coupler transmits the same
amount of power through the coupler when the input and output fibers are reversed.
