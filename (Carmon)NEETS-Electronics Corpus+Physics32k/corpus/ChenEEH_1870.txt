next hop server for different users and returns the IP address of
the machine where callee can be found (step 3). On getting this
IP address, the proxy server forwards the INVITE message
(step 5) to the host machine. After the UAS has been reached,
it sends an OK response back to the proxy server (step 8),
assuming that the callee wants to accept the call. The proxy
server, in turn, sends back an OK response to the client (step
9). The client then conﬁrms that he or she has received the
response by sending an ACK (step 10). A full-ﬂedged multi-
media session is now initiated between the two participants. At
the end of this session, the callee sends a BYE message to the
caller (step 11), which in turn ends the session with another
BYE message (step 12). Note that we have skipped the
TRYING and RINGING message exchanges (step 4, step 6,
and step 7) in the above explanation.
