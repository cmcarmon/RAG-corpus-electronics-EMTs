Inherent  memory  is  achieved  for  the  dc  plasma  structure  of  Fig. 83.32  with  the  pulsed  memory  mode
waveforms shown in Fig. 83.33 [Takano et al., 1994]. This operates on the principle that if there is metastable
priming  from  the  preceding  discharge  pulse,  then  the  discharge  will  build  up  in  a  sufﬁciently  short  time  to
fully  mature  during  the  very  short  electrode  voltage  pulse.  The  electrode  voltage  pulse  is  adjusted  to  be
sufﬁciently short to inhibit a sequence of discharges if there has not been an initiating higher amplitude address
pulse. The pulse memory mode was invented over 25 years ago [Holz, 1972], and is the most widely studied
technique for achieving memory in dc plasma displays. It was just recently introduced to commercial production.
