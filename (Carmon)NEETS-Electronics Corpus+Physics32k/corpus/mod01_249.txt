There are two kinds of resistors, FIXED and VARIABLE. The fixed resistor will have one value and
will never change (other than through temperature, age, etc.). The resistors shown in A and B of figure 1-
29 are classed as fixed resistors. The tapped resistor illustrated in B has several fixed taps and makes
more than one resistance value available. The sliding contact resistor shown in C has an adjustable collar
that can be moved to tap off any resistance within the ohmic value range of the resistor.
