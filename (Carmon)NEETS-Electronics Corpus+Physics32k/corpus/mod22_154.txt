In most computers, it is useful to have often used instructions, such as those used to bootstrap (initial 
system load) the computer or other specialized programs, permanently stored inside the computer. 
Memory that enables us to do this without the programs and data being lost (even when the computer is 
powered down) is called read-only memory. Only the computer manufacturer can provide these programs 
in ROM and once done, they cannot be changed. Consequently, you cannot put any of your own data or 
programs in ROM. Many complex functions such as routines to extract square roots, translators for 
programming languages, and operating systems can be placed in ROM memory. Since these instructions 
are hard wired (permanent), they can be performed quickly and accurately. Another advantage of ROM is
