Pyrosensitive Smart Materials
Electromagnetic active surfaces constituted by pyrosensitive inclusions have been successfully developed to manage
the electromagnetic reï¬‚ection and/or absorption characteristics from the active surface by means of thermal actu-
 
1992]. With the inclusion of a feedback
ation of the pyrosensitive nodes imbedded in the medium [Neelakanta et al.,
systems, smart operation in adaptively manipulating the active surface characteristics can be achieved.
