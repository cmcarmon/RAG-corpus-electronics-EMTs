A wheelie is imminent when the acceleration is sufficient to reduce the load borne by the front axle to zero. The conditions for this can be calculated with the so-called "weight transfer equation":




Δ
W
e
i
g
h

t

f
r
o
n
t


=
a


h
w


m


{\displaystyle \Delta Weight_{front}=a{\frac {h}{w}}m}

where



Δ
W
e
i
g
h

t

f
r
o
n
t




{\displaystyle \Delta Weight_{front}}
is the change in load borne by the front wheels,



a


{\displaystyle a}
is the longitudinal acceleration,



h


{\displaystyle h}
is the center of mass height,



w


{\displaystyle w}
is the wheelbase, and



m


{\displaystyle m}
is the total vehicle mass.
An equivalent expression, which does not require knowing the load borne by the front wheels nor the total vehicle mass, is for the minimum longitudinal acceleration required for a wheelie:





a

m
i
n


=
g


b
h




{\displaystyle a_{min}=g{\frac {b}{h}}}

where



g


{\displaystyle g}
is the acceleration due to gravity,



b


{\displaystyle b}
is the horizontal distance from the rear axle to the center of mass, and



h


{\displaystyle h}
is the vertical distance from the ground to the center of mass. Thus the minimum acceleration required is directly proportional to how far forward the center of mass is located and inversely proportional to how high it is located.
Since mechanical power can be defined as force times velocity, in one dimension, and force is equivalent to mass times acceleration, then the minimum power required for a wheelie can be expressed as the product of mass, velocity, and the minimum acceleration required for a wheelie:





P

m
i
n


=
m
v

a

m
i
n




{\displaystyle P_{min}=mva_{min}}

Thus the minimum power required is directly proportional to the mass of the vehicle and to its velocity. The slower a vehicle is moving, the less power is required to perform a wheelie, and that is without even considering the power required to overcome air drag, which increases with the cube of velocity. Therefore, the least amount of power required is when the vehicle begins accelerating from rest.
In the case of tractor and truck pulling, the force to the pull the load is applied above the ground, and so it also acts to lift the front wheels and thus reduces the forward acceleration necessary to lift the front wheels.
