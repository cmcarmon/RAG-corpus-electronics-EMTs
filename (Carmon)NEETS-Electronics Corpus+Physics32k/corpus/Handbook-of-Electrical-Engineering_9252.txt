It is obvious that testing must be carried out for each of the factors utilized by the Function Point metric.
Empirical observations indicate that from two to four test cases per Function Point are the normal quantities
created by commercial software vendors and computer manufacturers. Thus for an application of 1000 Function
Points in size, from 2000 to 4000 test cases may be required to test the user-deﬁned functionality of the application.
Testing can be approached from several directions. Testing which attempts to validate user requirements or
the functionality of software, without regard for its inner structure of the application, is termed black-box testing.
 Black-box test case construction for software has long been a largely manual operation that is both labor-
intensive and unreliable. (Empirical observations of operating system test libraries revealed more errors in the
test cases than in the product being tested.) Test case generators have been used experimentally since the 1970s
and are starting to appear as both stand-alone products and as parts of CASE tool suites. However, in order
for  test  case  generation  to  work  effectively,  the  speciﬁcations  or  written  description  of  the  software  must  be
fairly  complete,  rigorous,  and  valid  in  its  own  right.  It  is  to  no  purpose  to  generate  automatic  test  cases  for
incorrect speciﬁcations.
