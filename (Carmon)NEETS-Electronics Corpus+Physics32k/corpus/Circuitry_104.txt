Capacitance and physical dimensions 
 
The  capacitance  of  a  capacitor  depends  upon  the 
physical dimensions of the capacitor (i.e. the size of 
the plates and the separation between them) and the 
dielectric  material  between 
the  plates.  The 
capacitance  of  a  conventional  parallel  plate 
capacitor is given by:
