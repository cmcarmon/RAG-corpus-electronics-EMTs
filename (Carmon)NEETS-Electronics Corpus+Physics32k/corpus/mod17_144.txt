Transmitters and receivers must each perform two basic functions. The transmitter must generate a
radio frequency signal of sufficient power at the desired frequency. It must have some means of varying
(or modulating) the basic frequency so that it can carry an intelligible signal. The receiver must select the
desired frequency you want to receive and reject all unwanted frequencies. In addition, receivers must be
able to amplify the weak incoming signal to overcome the losses the signal suffers in its journey through
space.
