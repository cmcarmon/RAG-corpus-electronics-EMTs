When a device uses a two-prong plug, it provides 
two ways of plugging the device to the AC power 
source. One way could connect the chassis directly 
to the hot side of the AC source. If the user touches 
ground and the chassis, it could result in a lethal shock.
When using test equipment with two-prong plugs, 
if one piece is plugged in with a reversed connec-
tion, a voltage could exist between two pieces of test
