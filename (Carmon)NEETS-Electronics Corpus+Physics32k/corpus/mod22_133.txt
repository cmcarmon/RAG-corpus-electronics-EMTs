The brain of a computer system is the central processing unit, which we generally refer to as the cpu 
or mainframe. The central processing unit IS THE COMPUTER. It is the cpu that processes the data 
transferred to it from one of the various input devices, and then transfers either the intermediate or final 
results of the processing to one of many output devices. A central control section and work areas are 
required to perform calculations or manipulate data. The cpu is the computing center of the system. It 
consists of a control section, internal storage section (main or primary memory), and arithmetic-logic 
section (fig. 2-1). Each of the sections within the cpu serves a specific function and has a particular 
relationship to the other sections within the cpu.
