The white lamellae are conventionally explained by two other ways. They can be zonal growths or tensile fractures that could be reactivated (healed) in many ways. The first option is less probable, because the lamellae intersect each other. The zonal growths respect the crystallographic planes. The second option is much more probable. Variations of tensile fractures can be found for example in ice. An example can be the Jupiter's moon Europa that has a surface, which is cut by a dense net of fractures. However the tensile fractures and various ruptures have in comparison to hypothetical cavitation lamellae usually not a straight shape, they are radially distributed, cracked or one fracture is linked to another fracture in its certain part.
