Particles in acoustic field will be moved by forces originated from the interaction among the acoustic waves, fluid and the particles. These forces, including acoustic radiation force, secondary field force between particles, and Stokes drag force, create the phenomena of acoustophoresis, which is the foundation of acoustic tweezers technology.
