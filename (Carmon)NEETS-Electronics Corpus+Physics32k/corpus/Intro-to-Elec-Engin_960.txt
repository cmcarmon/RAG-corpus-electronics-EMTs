11.5.6 Three single-phase, 10-kVA, 2400/120-V, 60-
Hz transformers are connected to form a three-
phase, 4160/208-V transformer bank. Each of
the single-phase transformers has an equivalent
series impedance of 10 + j25  referred to the
high-voltage side. The transformer bank is said
to deliver 27 kW at 208 V and 0.9 power factor
leading.
(a) Draw a schematic diagram of transformer
connections, and develop a per-phase equiv-
alent circuit.
