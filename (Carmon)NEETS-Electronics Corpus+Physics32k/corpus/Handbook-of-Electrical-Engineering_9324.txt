First, the scope rules of many programming languages permit subprograms to access entities of the program
in which they are deﬁned (static scoping) or of the calling program (dynamic scoping). These entities are called
nonlocal  in  contrast  to  those  deﬁned  within  the  subprogram  itself.  Nonvariable  entities  can  and  should  be
broadcast  by  means  of  nonlocal,  preferably  global  deﬁnitions  (i.e.,  deﬁnitions  available  to  all  modules  and
subprograms  within  an  entire  project).  For  these  entities—types,  procedures,  and  constant  values—global
deﬁnitions are very beneﬁcial, since changes that may become necessary need to be made only at the place of
