Figure 5-2 shows an oscilloscope presentation of an rf carrier that is amplitude-modulated by a 
complex wave, such as that of speech. Figures 5-4 and 5-5 show the effects of over 100% modulation on 
the carrier wave. The carrier wave envelope pattern (as shown in fig. 5-3) is obtained by applying the rf-
