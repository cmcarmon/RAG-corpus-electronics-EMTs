Example 1.13
The toroid in Figure 1.10 will be used to illustrate the compu-
tation of magnetic ﬂux and ﬂux linkage. Assume that m is so
large that all of the magnetic ﬁeld is trapped in the toroid. In
other words, ignore all ‘‘ﬂux leakage.’’ With a current I1 in coil
1, applying Ampe`re’s law of equation 1.29 along a closed
contour in the toroid yields:
