Yield Improvement
In addition to increasing the reliability and availability of a
circuit, improvement in chip yield is another important beneﬁt
of fault tolerance. With the aid of a model relating yield to
circuit area and defect density, the yield improvement pro-
vided by a REMOD implementation has been analyzed taking
into account the possibility of faults due to defects in the
redundant portions of
the circuitry (Dutt and Hanchek,
1997). Chip yield is deﬁned as the percentage of usable chips.
The Poisson yield model (Cunningham, 1990) was used for
defect distribution where defects are assumed to occur uni-
formly and independently.1 For a k-FT circuit, the yield is the
sum of the circuit yields for each number of faulty cells up to k.
For adders, which have small, relatively simple cells, the
yield improvement obtained is small. For a circuit with rea-
sonably complex cells, however, very good yield improvement
is obtained. This is shown in Figure 8.5 for 32-bit Wallace
tree multipliers. It is also apparent in this ﬁgure that greater
degrees of FT do provide greater yield improvement of well
over 50%.
