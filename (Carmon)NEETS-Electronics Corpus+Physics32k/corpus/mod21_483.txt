In the vhf and uhf ranges, modulation is normally measured by applying a specific-level, 1-kilohertz 
tone to the input of the modulator. This, in turn, produces a significant drop in the plate voltage of the 
final output stage of the modulator. The correct setting of output plate voltage ensures that 
overmodulation will not occur.
