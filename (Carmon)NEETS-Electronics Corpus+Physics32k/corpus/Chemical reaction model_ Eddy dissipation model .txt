The eddy dissipation model, based on the work of Magnussen and Hjertager is a turbulent-chemistry reaction model. Most fuels are fast burning and the overall rate of reaction is controlled by turbulence mixing. In the non-premixed flames, turbulence slowly mixes the fuel and oxidizer into the reaction zones where they burn quickly. In premixed flames the turbulence slowly mixes cold reactants and hot products into the reaction zones where reaction occurs rapidly. In such cases the combustion is said to be mixing-limited, and the complex and often unknown chemical kinetics can be safely neglected. In this model, the chemical reaction is governed by large eddy mixing time scale. Combustion initiates whenever there is turbulence present in the flow. It does not need an ignition source to initiate the combustion. It is good for the non-premixed combustion but for the premixed flames the reactant will burn at the moment they enter in the computation model, which is incorrect. The reactant need some time to get to the ignition temperature to initiate the combustion. It is a shortcoming of this model.
