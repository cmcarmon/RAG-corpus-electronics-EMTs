The important thing to note here is that as you travel around a DC circuit, you 
gain voltage going from the negative terminal of the battery to the positive 
terminal (that’s known as a voltage rise), and you lose, or drop, voltage as you 
continue in the same direction across circuit components. (See Figure 3-13.) 
By the time you get back to the negative terminal of the battery, all the bat-
tery voltage has been dropped and you’re back to 0 volts.
