The theoretical mechanical advantage for a screw can be calculated using the following equation:




M
A
=



ฯ

d

m



l




{\displaystyle MA={\frac {\pi d_{m}}{l}}}

where
dm = the mean diameter of the screw thread
l = the lead of the screw thread
Note that the actual mechanical advantage of a screw system is greater, as a screwdriver or other screw driving system has a mechanical advantage as well.
Inclined plane: MA = length of slope รท height of the slope
