Just as imposing the classical simplicity constraint recovers general relativity from BF theory, one expects an appropriate quantum simplicity constraint will recover quantum gravity from quantum BF theory.
Much progress has been made with regard to this issue by Engle, Pereira, and Rovelli and Freidel and Krasnov in defining spin foam interaction amplitudes with much better behaviour.
An attempt to make contact between EPRL-FK spin foam and the canonical formulation of LQG has been made.
