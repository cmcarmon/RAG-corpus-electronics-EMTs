Every ﬁle in the ﬁle hierarchy can be speciﬁed by its given
path name from the top of the hierarchy, the root directory.
Such absolute path names consist of the list of directories that
must be traversed from the root directory to get to the ﬁle,
with special symbols such as slashes separating the compo-
nents. In Figure 4.3, the path for ﬁle passwd is denoted as /etc/
passwd. The leading slash indicates that the path is starting
from the root directory. As an aside, some systems use a back
slash(n) instead of a regular slash(/) as the separator in path
names.
