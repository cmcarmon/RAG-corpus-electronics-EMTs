The spark coil of an automobile ignition system has a 20-mH inductance
and  a 
resistance.  With  a  supply  voltage  of  12  V,  calculate:  the
time needed  for  the  coil  to  fully  charge,  the  energy  stored  in  the  coil,
and the voltage developed at the spark gap if the switch opens in 
2 ms.
