The Lambda2 method consists of several steps. First we define the gradient velocity tensor

{\displaystyle \mathbf {J} \equiv \nabla {\vec {u}}={\begin{bmatrix}\partial _{x}u_{x}&\partial _{y}u_{x}&\partial _{z}u_{x}\\\partial _{x}u_{y}&\partial _{y}u_{y}&\partial _{z}u_{y}\\\partial _{x}u_{z}&\partial _{y}u_{z}&\partial _{z}u_{z}\end{bmatrix}},}

where






u
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {u}}}
is the velocity field. The gradient velocity tensor is then decomposed into its symmetric and antisymmetric parts:





S

J

J


T

{\displaystyle \mathbf {S} ={\frac {\mathbf {J} +\mathbf {J} ^{\text{T}}}{2}}}
and




Ω

=




J

−


J


T



2


,


{\displaystyle \mathbf {\Omega } ={\frac {\mathbf {J} -\mathbf {J} ^{\text{T}}}{2}},}

where T is the transpose operation. Next the three eigenvalues of





S


2


+


Ω


2




{\displaystyle \mathbf {S} ^{2}+\mathbf {\Omega } ^{2}}
are calculated so that for each point in the velocity field






u
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {u}}}
there are three corresponding eigenvalues;




λ

1




{\displaystyle \lambda _{1}}
,




λ

2




{\displaystyle \lambda _{2}}
and




λ

3




{\displaystyle \lambda _{3}}
. The eigenvalues are ordered in such a way that




λ

1


≥

λ

2


≥

λ

3




{\displaystyle \lambda _{1}\geq \lambda _{2}\geq \lambda _{3}}
. A point in the velocity field is part of a vortex core only if at least two of its eigenvalues are negative i.e. if




λ

2


<
0


{\displaystyle \lambda _{2}<0}
. This is what gave the Lambda2 method its name.
Using the Lambda2 method, a vortex can be defined as a connected region where




λ

2




{\displaystyle \lambda _{2}}
is negative. However, in situations where several vortices exist, it can be difficult for this method to distinguish between individual vortices  . The Lambda2 method has been used in practice to, for example, identify vortex rings present in the blood flow inside the human heart
