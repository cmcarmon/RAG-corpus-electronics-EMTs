The EmDrive appears to violate the conservation of momentum which states any interaction cannot have a net force; a consequence of the conservation of momentum is Newton's third law where for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. The conservation of momentum is a symmetry of nature.
In instances where matter appears to violate conservation laws, the apparent non-conservation is in reality an interaction with the vacuum so that overall symmetry in the system is restored. An often cited example of apparent nonconservation of momentum is the Casimir effect; in the standard case where two parallel plates are attracted to each other. However the plates move in opposite directions, so no net momentum is extracted from the vacuum and, moreover, the energy must be put into the system to take the plates apart again.
Assuming homogeneous electric and magnetic fields, it is impossible for the EmDrive, or any other device, to extract a net momentum transfer from either a classical or quantum vacuum. Extraction of a net momentum "from nothing" has been postulated in an inhomogeneous vacuum, but this remains highly controversial as it will violate Lorentz invariance.
Both Harold White's and Mike McCulloch's theories of how the EmDrive could work rely on these asymmetric or dynamical Casimir effects. However, if these vacuum forces are present, they are expected to be exceptionally tiny based on our current understanding, too small to explain the level of observed thrust. In the event that observed thrust is not due to experimental error, a positive result could indicate new physics.
