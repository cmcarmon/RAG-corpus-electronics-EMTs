QTCs come in different forms and each form is used differently but has a similar resistance change when deformed. QTC pills are the most commonly used type of QTC. Pills are pressure sensitive variable resistors. The amount of electric current passed is exponentially proportionate to the amount of pressure applied. QTC pills can be used as input sensors which respond to an applied force. These pills can also be used in devices to control higher currents than QTC sheets. QTC sheets are composed of three layers: a thin layer of QTC material, a conductive material and a plastic insulator. QTC sheets allow a quick switch from high to low resistance and vice versa.
