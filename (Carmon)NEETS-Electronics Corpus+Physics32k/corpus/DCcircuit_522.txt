circuit construction often demands a different component orientation. Building simple circuits
on terminal strips is one way to develop the spatial-reasoning skill of ”stretching” wires to
make the same connection paths. Consider the case of a single-battery, three-resistor parallel
circuit constructed on a terminal strip:
