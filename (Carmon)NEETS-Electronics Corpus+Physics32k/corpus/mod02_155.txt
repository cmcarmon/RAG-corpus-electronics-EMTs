Notice the dielectric constant for a vacuum. Since a vacuum is the standard of reference, it is assigned a
constant of one. The dielectric constants of all materials are compared to that of a vacuum. Since the
dielectric constant of air has been determined to be approximately the same as that of a vacuum, the
dielectric constant of AIR is also considered to be equal to one.
