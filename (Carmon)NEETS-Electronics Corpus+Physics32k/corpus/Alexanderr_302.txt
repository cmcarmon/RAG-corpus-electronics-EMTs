According  to  Eq.  (6.18),  a  discontinuous  change  in  the  current
through an inductor requires an inÔ¨Ånite voltage, which is not phys-
ically possible. Thus, an inductor opposes an abrupt change in the
current  through  it.  For  example,  the  current  through  an  inductor
may take the form shown in Fig. 6.25(a), whereas the inductor cur-
rent cannot take the form shown in Fig. 6.25(b) in real-life situa-
tions  due  to  the  discontinuities.  However,  the  voltage  across  an
inductor can change abruptly.
