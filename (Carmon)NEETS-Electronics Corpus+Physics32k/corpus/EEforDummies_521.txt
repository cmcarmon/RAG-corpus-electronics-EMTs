If you have an unshielded coil in one circuit, and place it close to an 
unshielded coil in another circuit, the coils will interact. By passing a current 
through one coil, you will cause a voltage to be induced in the neighboring 
coil â€” even though it is in a separate, unconnected circuit. This is known as 
transformer action.
