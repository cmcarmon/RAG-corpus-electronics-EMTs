Electroplastic Smart Materials
Electroplastic  materials  are  useful  as  smart  elastic  media  inasmuch  as  the  stimulus  that  modiÔ¨Åes  the  elastic
deformation is the electric current that can be controlled externally. The usefulness of these materials for smart
systems under room temperature conditions is still under investigation.
