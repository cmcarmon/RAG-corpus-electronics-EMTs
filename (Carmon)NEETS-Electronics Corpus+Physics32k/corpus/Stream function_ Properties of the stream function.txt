The stream function



Ïˆ


{\displaystyle \psi }
is constant on any streamline.
For a continuous flow (no sources or sinks), the volume flow rate across any closed path is equal to zero.
For two incompressible flow patterns, the algebraic sum of the stream functions is equal to another stream function obtained if the two flow patterns are super-imposed.
The rate of change of stream function with distance is directly proportional to the velocity component perpendicular to the direction of change.
