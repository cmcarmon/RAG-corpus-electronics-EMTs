Radar systems, like cars, come in a variety of sizes and have different performance specifications.
Some radar systems are used for air-traffic control at airports and others are used for long-range
surveillance and early-warning systems. A radar system is the heart of a missile guidance system. Small
portable radar systems that can be maintained and operated by one person are available as well as systems
that occupy several large rooms.
