EXAMPLE 3.1.2
Consider a GLC parallel circuit excited by i(t) = Iest in the time domain. Assume no initial
inductive current or capacitive voltage at t = 0. Draw the transformed network in the frequency
s-domain and solve for the frequency-domain forced response of the resultant voltage. Then Ô¨Ånd
the t-domain forced response v(t).
