Values of this convective resistance, for a variety of coolants and heat transfer mechanisms, are shown in Fig. 33.3
 and a velocity range of 2–8 m/s. These resistances are seen to vary from
for a typical heat source area of 10 cm
100 K/W for natural convection in air to 33 K/W for forced convection in air, to 1 K/W in ﬂuorocarbon liquid
in forced convection to less than 0.5 K/W for boiling in ﬂuorocarbon liquids.
