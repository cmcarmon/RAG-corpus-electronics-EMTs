The question of feedback in circuits and systems can be viewed
in a denumerable number of different ways. It is, therefore, no
longer possible to give a coherent, yet brief, overview of the
subject. I am reminded of the story of the hotel with an inÔ¨Ånite
number of rooms. In such a hotel, there is always room for
another guest. To accommodate the next guest, even if all the
rooms are occupied, one has only to ask each room occupant
to move to the room with the next higher number. When this
is done, all the current occupants will again be in a room, and
room one will be available for the new guest!
