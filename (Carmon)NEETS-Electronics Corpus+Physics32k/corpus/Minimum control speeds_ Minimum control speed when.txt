The vertical tail or vertical stabilizer of a multi-engine aircraft plays a crucial role in maintaining directional control while an engine fails or is inoperative. The larger the tail, the more capable it will be of providing the required force to counteract the asymmetrical thrust yawing moment. This means that the smaller the tail is, the higher the VMCA will be. However, a larger tail is more costly and harder to accommodate, and comes with other aerodynamic issues such as increased prevalence of slipstreams. Engineers designing the vertical tail must make a decision based on, amongst other factors, their budget, the weight of the aircraft, and the maximum bank angle of 5Â° (away from the inoperative engine), as stated by FAR.
VMCA is also used to calculate the minimum takeoff safety speed. A high VMCA therefore results in higher takeoff speeds, and so longer runways are required, which is undesirable for airport operators.
