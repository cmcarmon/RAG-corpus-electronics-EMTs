Speed Control of DC Motors
Equation (13.4.8) showed that the speed of a dc motor can be varied by control of the ﬁeld
ﬂux, the armature resistance, and the armature applied voltage. The three most common speed-
control methods are shunt-ﬁeld rheostat control, armature circuit-resistance control, and armature
terminal-voltage control. The base speed of the machine is deﬁned as the speed with rated armature
voltage and normal armature resistance and ﬁeld ﬂux. Speed control above the base value can
be obtained by varying the ﬁeld ﬂux. By inserting a series resistance in the shunt-ﬁeld circuit
of a dc shunt motor (or a compound motor), we can achieve speed control over a wide range
above the base speed. It is important to note, however, that a reduction in the ﬁeld ﬂux causes a
corresponding increase in speed, so that the generated emf does not change appreciably while the
speed is increased, but the machine torque is reduced as the ﬁeld ﬂux is reduced. The dc motor
with shunt-ﬁeld rheostat speed control is accordingly referred to as a constant-horsepower drive.
This method of speed control is suited to applications in which the load torque falls as the speed
increases. For a machine with a series ﬁeld, speed control above the base value can be achieved
by placing a diverter resistance in parallel with the series winding, so that the ﬁeld current is less
than the armature current.
