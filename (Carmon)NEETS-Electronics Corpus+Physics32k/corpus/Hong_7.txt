Voltage is the difference in electrical potential between two points in space.  It is 
a measure of the amount of energy gained or lost by moving a unit of positive charge 
from one point to another, as shown in Figure 1.1. Voltage is measured in units of Joules 
per Coulomb, known as a Volt (V). It is important to remember that voltage is not an 
absolute quantity; rather, it is always considered as a relative value between two points. 
In  an  electronic  circuit,  the  electromagnetic  problem  of  voltages  at  arbitrary  points  in 
space  is  typically  simplified  to  voltages  between  nodes  of  circuit  components  such  as 
resistors, capacitors, and transistors.
