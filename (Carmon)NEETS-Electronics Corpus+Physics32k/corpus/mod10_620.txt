For transmission over bodies of water, vertical polarization is much better than horizontal 
polarization for antennas at the lower heights. As the frequency increases, the minimum antenna height 
decreases. At 30 megahertz, vertical polarization is better for antenna heights below about 91 meters (300 
feet); at 85 megahertz, antenna heights below 15 meters (50 feet); and still lower heights at the high 
frequencies. Therefore, at ordinary antenna mast heights of 12 meters (40 feet), vertical polarization is 
advantageous for frequencies less than about 100 megahertz.
