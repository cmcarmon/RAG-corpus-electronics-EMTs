With the two-battery circuit, there is no way to arrive at a value for “total resistance,”
because there are two sources of power to provide voltage and current (we would need two
“total” resistances in order to proceed with any Ohm’s Law calculations). With the unbalanced
bridge circuit, there is such a thing as total resistance across the one battery (paving the way
for a calculation of total current), but that total current immediately splits up into unknown
proportions at each end of the bridge, so no further Ohm’s Law calculations for voltage (E=IR)
can be carried out.
