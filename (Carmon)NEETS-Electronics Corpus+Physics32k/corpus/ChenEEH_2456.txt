A slot antenna, as shown in Figure 6.16, is considered another
basic radiating element. It is realized by removing a small area
of metal from an inﬁnite ground plane. For a practical design,
however, the ground plane may be ﬁnite but large in size. The
open area, or the ‘slot,’ can be of any shape and size, but is
shown in Figure 6.16 to be rectangular, as is often done for
simplicity. As shown in this ﬁgure, a slot antenna may be
excited by applying a voltage source across the slot.
