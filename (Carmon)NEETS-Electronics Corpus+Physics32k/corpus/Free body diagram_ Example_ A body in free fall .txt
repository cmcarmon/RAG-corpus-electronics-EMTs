Consider a body in free fall in a uniform gravitational field. The body may be
a particle. It is enough to show a single vertically downward pointing arrow attached to a blob.
rigid extended. A single arrow suffices to represent the weight W even though gravitational attraction acts on every particle of the body.
non-rigid extended. In non-rigid analysis, it would be an error to associate a single point of application with the gravitational force.
