Let us denote the vector of bus voltages as V bus and the
vector of bus injection currents as I bus. By deﬁnition, the
admittance matrix Y bus provides the relationship I bus ¼
Y busV bus. Suppose the ith or jth entry Y ij of the Y bus matrix
has the magnitude Yij and the phase gij. Then, we can simplify
the current injection I i as:
