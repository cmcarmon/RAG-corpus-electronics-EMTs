The velocity, or the rate of change of position with time, is defined as the derivative of the position with respect to time:





v

=




d


r




d

t







{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} ={\mathrm {d} \mathbf {r}  \over \mathrm {d} t}\,\!}
.
In classical mechanics, velocities are directly additive and subtractive. For example, if one car travels east at 60 km/h and passes another car traveling in the same direction at 50 km/h, the slower car perceives the faster car as traveling east at 60 − 50 = 10 km/h. However, from the perspective of the faster car, the slower car is moving 10 km/h to the west, often denoted as -10 km/h where the sign implies opposite direction. Velocities are directly additive as vector quantities; they must be dealt with using vector analysis.
Mathematically, if the velocity of the first object in the previous discussion is denoted by the vector u = ud and the velocity of the second object by the vector v = ve, where u is the speed of the first object, v is the speed of the second object, and d and e are unit vectors in the directions of motion of each object respectively, then the velocity of the first object as seen by the second object is






u

u

v


.


{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} '=\mathbf {u} -\mathbf {v} \,.}

Similarly, the first object sees the velocity of the second object as






v
′


=

v

−

u


.


{\displaystyle \mathbf {v'} =\mathbf {v} -\mathbf {u} \,.}

When both objects are moving in the same direction, this equation can be simplified to






u

′

=
(
u
−
v
)

d


.


{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} '=(u-v)\mathbf {d} \,.}

Or, by ignoring direction, the difference can be given in terms of speed only:





u

=
u
−
v

.


{\displaystyle u'=u-v\,.}
