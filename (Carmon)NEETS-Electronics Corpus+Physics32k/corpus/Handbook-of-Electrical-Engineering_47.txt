Potentiometers  are  usually  circular  in  form  with  the  movable  contact  attached  to  a  shaft  that  rotates.
Potentiometers are manufactured as carbon composition, metallic Ô¨Ålm, and wire-wound resistors available in
single-turn  or  multiturn  units.  The  movable  contact  does  not  go  all  the  way  toward  the  end  of  the  resistive
element,  and  a  small  resistance  called  the  hop-off  resistance  is  present  to  prevent  accidental  burning  of  the
resistive element.
