A junction ﬁeld-effect transistor, or JFET, is a type of transistor in which the current ﬂow through the device
between  the  drain  and  source  electrodes  is  controlled  by  the  voltage  applied  to  the  gate  electrode. A  simple

-type conducting channel exists between

region  width  increases,  as  shown  in  Fig.  24.2.  The  depletion  region  extends  mostly  into  the 
 side. The depletion region is depleted of mobile charge carriers and thus
because of the heavy doping on the

n
-type channel available for current ﬂow decreases. This reduces the current
the cross-sectional areas of the 
ﬂow  between  drain  and  source.  As  the  gate  voltage  increases,  the  channel  gets  further  constricted,  and  the
current ﬂow gets smaller. Finally when the depletion regions meet in the middle of the channel, as shown in
Fig.  24.3,  the  channel  is  pinched  off  in  its  entirety  between  source  and  drain. At  this  point  the  current  ﬂow
between drain and source is reduced to essentially zero. This voltage is called the
