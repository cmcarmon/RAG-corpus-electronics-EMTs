To administer this method, place the heel of one hand on the victim's forehead and use the other 
hand to lift the jaw. After sealing the victim's lips, take a deep breath, place your lips over the victim's 
nose, and blow. Observe the chest for movement and place your ear next to the victim's nose to listen for, 
or feel, air exchange. Again, you must continue your efforts at the rate of 12 to 15 ventilation per minute, 
or one breath every 5 seconds, until the victim can breathe without assistance.
