Charge and Electric Force
The proton has a charge of +1.602 10
−19 coulombs (C), while the electron has a charge of
−1.602 × 10
−19 C. The neutron has zero charge. Electric charge and, more so, its movement
are the most basic items of interest in electrical engineering. When many charged particles are
collected together, larger charges and charge distributions occur. There may be point charges (C),
line charges (C/m), surface charge distributions (C/m2), and volume charge distributions (C/m3).
A charge is responsible for an electric ﬁeld and charges exert forces on each other. Like
charges repel, whereas unlike charges attract. Such an electric force can be controlled and utilized
for some useful purpose. Coulomb’s law gives an expression to evaluate the electric force in
newtons (N) exerted on one point charge by the other:
