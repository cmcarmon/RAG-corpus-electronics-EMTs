the LRL vector A is defined mathematically by the formula

where
m is the mass of the point particle moving under the central force,
p is its momentum vector,
L = r × p is its angular momentum vector,
k is a parameter that describes the strength of the central force,
r is the position vector of the particle (Figure 1), and

{\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {r}} }
is the corresponding unit vector, i.e.,

{\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {r}} ={\frac {\mathbf {r} }{r}}}
where r is the magnitude of r.
Since the assumed force is conservative, the total energy E is a constant of motion,

{\displaystyle E={\frac {p^{2}}{2m}}-{\frac {k}{r}}={\frac {1}{2}}mv^{2}-{\frac {k}{r}}~.}

Furthermore, the assumed force is a central force, and thus the angular momentum vector L is also conserved and defines the plane in which the particle travels. The LRL vector A is perpendicular to the angular momentum vector L because both p × L and r are perpendicular to L. It follows that A lies in the plane of the orbit.
This definition of the LRL vector A pertains to a single point particle of mass m moving under the action of a fixed force. However, the same definition may be extended to two-body problems such as Kepler's problem, by taking m as the reduced mass of the two bodies and r as the vector between the two bodies.
A variety of alternative formulations for the same constant of motion may also be used. The most common is to scale by mk to define the eccentricity vector
