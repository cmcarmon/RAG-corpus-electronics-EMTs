The relatively low efficiency of the twt partially offsets the advantages of high gain and wide 
bandwidth. The internal attenuator reduces the gain of the tube, and the power required to energize the 
focusing magnet is an operational loss that cannot be recovered. The twt also produces heat which must 
be dissipated by either air-conditioning or liquid-cooling systems. All of these factors reduce the overall 
efficiency of the twt, but the advantages of high gain and wide bandwidth are usually enough to overcome 
the disadvantages.
