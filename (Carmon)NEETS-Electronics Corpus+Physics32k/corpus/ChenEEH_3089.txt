The two principles that describe the electromagnetic behavior
of electric machines are Ampe`re’s law and Faraday’s law.
These are two of Maxwell’s equations. Most electric machines
operate by attraction or repulsion of electromagnets and/or
permanent magnets. Ampe`re’s law describes the magnetic ﬁeld
that can be produced by currents or magnets. In an electric
machine, there will always be at least one set of coils with
currents. A motor cannot be produced with permanent
magnets alone.
