Diffusion damping exponentially decreases anisotropies in the CMB on a scale (the Silk scale) much smaller than a degree, or smaller than approximately 3 megaparsecs. This angular scale corresponds to a multipole moment

{\displaystyle {\mathit {l}}\gtrsim 800}
. The mass contained within the Silk scale is the silk mass. Numerical evaluations of the Silk mass yield results on the order of

solar masses at recombination and on the order of the mass of a present-day galaxy or galaxy cluster in the current era.

Scientists say diffusion damping affects small angles and corresponding anisotropies. Other effects operate on a scale called intermediate

. Searches for anisotropies on a small scale are not as difficult as those on larger scales, partly because they may employ ground-based telescopes and their results can be more easily predicted by current theoretical models.
