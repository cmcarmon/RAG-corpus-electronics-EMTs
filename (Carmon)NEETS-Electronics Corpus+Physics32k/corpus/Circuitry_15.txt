Hence  one  Volt  is  equivalent  to  one  Joule  per 
Coulomb. 
 
Measuring angles 
 
You  might  think  it  strange  to  be  concerned  with 
angles  in  electrical  circuits.  The  reason  is  simply 
that, in analogue and a.c. circuits, signals are based 
on repetitive waves (often sinusoidal in shape). We 
can refer to a point on such a wave in one of two 
basic  ways,  either  in  terms  of  the  time  from  the 
start of the cycle or in terms of the angle (a cycle 
starts at 0° and finishes as 360° (see Fig. 1.1)). In 
practice,  it  is often  more  convenient  to  use  angles 
rather  than  time,  however,  the  two  methods  of 
measurement are interchangeable and it’s important 
to be able to work in either of these units. 
In  electrical  circuits,  angles  are  measured  in 
 
either degrees or radians (both of which are strictly 
dimensionless units). You will doubtless already be 
familiar with angular measure in degrees where one 
complete  circular  revolution  is  equivalent  to  an 
angular change of 360°. The alternative method of
