On April 5, 2010 the first CME of Solar Cycle 24 produced by a sunspot (but unrelated to flares; in fact, a single C-class X-ray flux event was registered this month) and causing a true geomagnetic storm was registered. Kp index, which quantifies disturbances in the horizontal component of Earth's magnetic field, was 7 by then, so the geomagnetic storm reached a G3 (strong level) in NOAA G-scale.
