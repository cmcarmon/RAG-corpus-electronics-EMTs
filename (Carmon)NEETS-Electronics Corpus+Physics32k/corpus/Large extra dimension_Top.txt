In particle physics, the ADD model, also known as the model with large extra dimensions (LED), is a model framework that attempts to solve the hierarchy problem by explaining the weakness of gravity relative to the other forces. This hypothesis requires that the fields of the Standard Model be confined to a four-dimensional membrane, while gravity propagates in several additional spatial dimensions that are large compared to the Planck scale.
The model was proposed by Nima Arkani-Hamed, Savas Dimopoulos, and Gia Dvali in 1998.
Results from the Large Hadron Collider do not appear to support the model thus far. However the operation range of the LHC (13 TeV collision energy) covers only a small part of the predicted range in which evidence for LED would be recorded (a few TeV to 1016 TeV).
