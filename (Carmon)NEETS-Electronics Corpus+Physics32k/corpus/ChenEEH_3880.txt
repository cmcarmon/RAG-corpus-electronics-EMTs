The MPEG-7 Variation DS describes the relationships
among the different variations of a media resource. For
example, Figure 5.2 shows the variations of a video resource
A. The variations differ in ﬁdelity and modality. The vertical
axis shows lower ﬁdelity variations of each resource. The
horizontal axis shows different modality variations (e.g.,
image, text, and audio) of each resource.
