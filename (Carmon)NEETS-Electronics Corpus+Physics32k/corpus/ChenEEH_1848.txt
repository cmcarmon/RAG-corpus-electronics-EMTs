Currently, IpSec can operate in transport mode or tunnel
mode. In transport mode, IpSec takes a packet to be protected,
preserves the packet’s IP header, and modiﬁes only the upper
layer portions by adding IpSec headers and the requested kind
of protection between the upper layers and the original IP
header. In the tunnel mode, IpSec treats the entire packet as
a block of data, adds a new packet header, and protects the data
by making it part of the encrypted payload of the new packet.
IpSec can be easily integrated into the current operating
system environment, by either changing the native implemen-
tation of IP protocol (and subsequent kernel compilation),
inserting an additional layer below the IP layer of the TCP/IP
protocol stack (also known as bump-in-the-stack [BITS]), or
using some external hardware (also known as bump-in-the-
wire [BITW]).
