2. Explain  (a)  why  each  speciÔ¨Åc  cascading  sequence  of  bifurcations  inevitably  occurs  in  a  differential
algebraic  model,  and  (b)  the  dynamic  signature  associated  with  each  bifurcation  sequence.  Work  is
underway to explain why instability in generator and load dynamics can inevitably cause a singularity-
induced bifurcation to occur. The time signature for singularity-induced bifurcation changes dependence
on why it occurs is discussed in [Schlueter, 1998e; Liu, 1998].
