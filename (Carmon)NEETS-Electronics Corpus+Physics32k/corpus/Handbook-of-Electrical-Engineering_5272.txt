Potential and Future
Globally, the potential for DG is vast. Even extremely site-speciﬁc resources such as tides, geothermal, and small
hydro  are  available  in  signiﬁcant  quantities.  Assessments  of  the  future  for  various  DG  technologies  vary,
depending on the enthusiasm of the estimator. However, in almost all cases, the limitations are economic rather
than technical. Concerns over the unrestricted use of depletable energy resources and the ensuing environmental
problems  such  as  the  greenhouse  effect  and  global  warming  are  providing  the  impetus  necessary  for  the
continued development of technologies for DG.
