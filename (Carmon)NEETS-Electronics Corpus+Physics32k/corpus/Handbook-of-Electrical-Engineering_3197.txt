Series  resonant  converters  [Fig. 30.32(a)]  have  high  efﬁciency  from  full  load  to  part  load.  Transformer
saturation  is  avoided  due  to  the  series  blocking  resonating  capacitor.  The  major  problems  with  the  SRC  are
that  it  requires  a  very  wide  change  in  switching  frequency  to  regulate  the  load  voltage  and  the  output  ﬁlter
capacitor must carry high ripple current (a major problem especially in low output voltage, high output current
applications).
