The system of designating rf emissions is arranged according to modulation type, mode, and 
supplementary characteristics. For example: A3B indicates amplitude modulation, telephony, two 
independent sidebands, and a suppressed carrier. Table 1-23 will assist you in breaking down the 
emission classification code.
