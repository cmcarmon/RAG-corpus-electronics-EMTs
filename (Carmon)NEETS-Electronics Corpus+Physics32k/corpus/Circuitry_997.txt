examples that we just looked at! 
  You may be wondering why we keep writing ‘to 
the base 10’. Logarithms can be to any base but 10  
just happens to be the most obvious and useful. 
 
Logarithmic notation 
 
The  notation  that  we  use  with  logarithms  is  quite 
straightforward: 
 
If  x = 10n we say that log10(x) = n.
The  subscript  that  appears  after  the  ‘log’  reminds 
us that we are using base 10 rather than any other 
(unspecified)  number.  Re-writing  what  we  said 
earlier using our logarithmic notation gives: 
 
log10(10) = log10(101) = 1
log10(100) = log10(102) = 2
