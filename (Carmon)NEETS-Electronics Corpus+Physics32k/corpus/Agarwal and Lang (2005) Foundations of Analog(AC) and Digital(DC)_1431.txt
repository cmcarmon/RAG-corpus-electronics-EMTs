At this point, it is worth discussing a slight mismatch between the digital
gate abstraction and the physical realities of computing the propagation delay.
From the viewpoint of the digital gate abstraction, the propagation delay tpd is
a property of the digital gate. Accordingly, we might say that an inverter (for
example, one identical to inverter A) always has a propagation delay of 2 ns.
However, the example discussed thus far illustrates that the propagation delay
of an inverter depends not only on the characteristics of its internal compo-
nents, but also on the size of the capacitance that it is driving, and therefore the
propagation delay of the inverter can change depending on its environment.
In particular, the propagation delay of inverter A in our example depends on
the input capacitance of inverter B. Thus, strictly speaking, it makes no sense
to define the propagation delay of a device in isolation. However, for conve-
nience, we would like to characterize devices with a single tpd without defining
their surrounding environment, so this simple device model can be used to
obtain quick estimates of digital circuit delays when multiple gates are con-
nected together. Accordingly, unless explicitly stated otherwise, device libraries
or catalogs define a tpd for a gate assuming it is driving a ‘‘typical’’ load
commonly, four minimum sized inverters.8
