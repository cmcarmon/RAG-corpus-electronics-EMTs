Section 11.2, Device Technology and Concepts, begins with
a discussion on noise at these frequencies. Because wireless
applications are the primary drive for development of these
frequency bands, understanding the basic concepts of noise at
these frequencies becomes of
importance in
understanding the sensitivity of high-frequency components,
such as low-noise ampliﬁers and mixers. The section continues
with an introduction to the most common microwave devices,
including bipolar transistors, ﬁeld-effect transistors, high elec-
tron mobility transistors, and two-terminal microwave devices.
Noise mechanisms and most common applications as well as
their most common small-signal models are discussed. Het-
erojunction bipolar transistors are brieﬂy mentioned in the
section on bipolar transistors.
