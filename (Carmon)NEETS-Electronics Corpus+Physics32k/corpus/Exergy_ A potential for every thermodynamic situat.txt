{\displaystyle B=A+P_{R}V\qquad {\mbox{(6)}}}

For a given set of chemicals at a given temperature and pressure, Gibbs free energy G is used in the expression:

(7)




{\displaystyle B=G\qquad {\mbox{(7)}}}

The potentials A and G are utilized for a constant temperature process. In these cases, all energy is free to perform useful work because there is no entropic loss. A chemical reaction that generates electricity with no associated change in temperature will also experience no entropic loss. (See Fuel cell.) This is true of every isothermal process. Examples are gravitational potential energy, kinetic energy (on a macroscopic scale), solar energy, electrical energy, and many others. If friction, absorption, electrical resistance or a similar energy conversion takes place that releases heat, the impact of that heat on thermodynamic potentials must be considered, and it is this impact that decreases the available energy.
