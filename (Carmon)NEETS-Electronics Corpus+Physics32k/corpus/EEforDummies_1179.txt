Testing switches
Mechanical switches can get dirty and worn, or sometimes even break, 
making them unreliable or completely unable to pass electrical current. 
Chapter 4 describes four common types of switches: single‐pole, single‐throw 
(SPST); single‐pole, double‐throw (SPDT); double‐pole, single‐throw (DPST); 
and double‐pole, double‐throw (DPDT). Depending on the switch, there may 
be zero, one, or two off positions, and there may be one or two on positions.
