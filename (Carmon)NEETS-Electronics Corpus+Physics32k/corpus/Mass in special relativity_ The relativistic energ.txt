The relativistic expressions for E and p obey the relativistic energy–momentum relation:





E

2


−
(
p
c

)

2


=


(

m

c

2



)


2




{\displaystyle E^{2}-(pc)^{2}=\left(mc^{2}\right)^{2}}

where the m is the rest mass, or the invariant mass for systems, and E is the total energy.
The equation is also valid for photons, which have m = 0:





E

2


−
(
p
c

)

2


=
0


{\displaystyle E^{2}-(pc)^{2}=0}

and therefore




E
=
p
c


{\displaystyle E=pc}

A photon's momentum is a function of its energy, but it is not proportional to the velocity, which is always c.
For an object at rest, the momentum p is zero, therefore





E

0


=
m

c

2






{\displaystyle E_{0}=mc^{2}\,\!}
[true only for particles or systems with momentum = 0]
The rest mass is only proportional to the total energy in the rest frame of the object.
When the object is moving, the total energy is given by




E
=




(

m

c

2



)


2


+
(
p
c

)

2






{\displaystyle E={\sqrt {\left(mc^{2}\right)^{2}+(pc)^{2}}}}

To find the form of the momentum and energy as a function of velocity, it can be noted that the four-velocity, which is proportional to




(

c
,



v
→




)



{\displaystyle \left(c,{\vec {v}}\right)}
, is the only four-vector associated with the particle's motion, so that if there is a conserved four-momentum




(

E
,



p
→



c

)



{\displaystyle \left(E,{\vec {p}}c\right)}
, it must be proportional to this vector. This allows expressing the ratio of energy to momentum as




p
c
=
E


v
c




{\displaystyle pc=E{\frac {v}{c}}}
,
resulting in a relation between E and v:





E

2


=


(

m

c

2



)


2


+

E

2





v

2



c

2




,


{\displaystyle E^{2}=\left(mc^{2}\right)^{2}+E^{2}{\frac {v^{2}}{c^{2}}},}

This results in




E
=



m

c

2





1
−




v

2



c

2











{\displaystyle E={mc^{2} \over {\sqrt {1-\displaystyle {v^{2} \over c^{2}}}}}}

and




p
=



m
v



1
−




v

2



c

2









.


{\displaystyle p={mv \over {\sqrt {1-\displaystyle {v^{2} \over c^{2}}}}}.}

these expressions can be written as





E

0


=
m

c

2





{\displaystyle E_{0}=mc^{2}\,}
,




E
=
γ
m

c

2





{\displaystyle E=\gamma mc^{2}\,}
, and




p
=
m
v
γ

.


{\displaystyle p=mv\gamma \,.}

When working in units where c = 1, known as the natural unit system, all the relativistic equations are simplified and the quantities energy, momentum, and mass have the same natural dimension:





m

2


=

E

2


−

p

2




{\displaystyle m^{2}=E^{2}-p^{2}}
.
The equation is often written this way because the difference




E

2


−

p

2




{\displaystyle E^{2}-p^{2}}
is the relativistic length of the energy momentum four-vector, a length which is associated with rest mass or invariant mass in systems. Where m > 0 and p = 0, this equation again expresses the mass-energy equivalence E = m.
