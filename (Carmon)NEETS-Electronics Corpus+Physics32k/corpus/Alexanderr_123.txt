Once we have selected a reference node, we assign voltage desig-
nations  to  nonreference  nodes.  Consider,  for  example,  the  circuit  in
Fig. 3.2(a).  Node  0  is  the  reference  node 
while  nodes  1  and
2 are assigned voltages 
respectively. Keep in mind that the
node voltages are deÔ¨Åned with respect to the reference node. As illus-
trated in Fig. 3.2(a), each node voltage is the voltage rise from the ref-
erence  node  to  the  corresponding  nonreference  node  or  simply  the
voltage of that node with respect to the reference node.
