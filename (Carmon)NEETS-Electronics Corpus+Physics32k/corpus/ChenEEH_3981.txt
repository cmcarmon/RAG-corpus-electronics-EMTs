Partitioning
If the number of processors is limited and much less than the
number of PEs required for a particular algorithm, the DG
must be partitioned and mapped to ﬁt that ﬁxed size array.
Hwang and Hu (1992) have proposed a two-level locally se-
quential globally parallel (LSGP) scheduling to reduce the
overall computing time. The DG is ﬁrst partitioned into a set
of disjoint blocks. Those blocks will be allocated to available
processors and scheduled with a two-level schedule. The ﬁrst-
level sequential schedule is obtained from applying permissible
loop transformations. The second-level parallel schedule is
formulated as an integer programming problem subject to
the total computation latency. An interblock schedule is ap-
plied to determine the relative timing of each block’s compu-
tation and satisfy the precedence constraints imposed by
dependence vectors across the block boundaries.
