When a station selection button is momentarily depressed, the RBS causes a new station to be selected. This
selection is made on the basis of station-setting information stored within the RBS. The RBS can “memorize”
new station selections in the following manner: When a given station selection button is depressed longer than
“momentarily”  (say,  for  more  than  2  seconds),  the  currently  selected  station  will  be  “memorized.”  Future
momentary depressions of this button will result in this “memorized” station being selected.
