8 · 8 optical switch matrix that uses 64 identical 2 · 2 optical switches. The most device diversity on a given
substrate  is  found  in  ﬁber  gyro  applications.  Here,  components  incorporating  six  phase  modulators,  two
electrically tunable directional couplers, and two passive directional couplers have been demonstrated.
