We represent a bit by associating one of two speciﬁc analog signals with the bit’s value. Thus, if b (n) = 0,
we transmit the signal s0 (t); if b (n) = 1, send s1 (t). These two signals comprise the signal set for digital
communication and are designed with the channel and bit stream in mind. In virtually every case, these
signals have a ﬁnite duration T common to both signals; this duration is known as the bit interval.
Exactly what signals we use ultimately aﬀects how well the bits can be received. Interestingly, baseband
and modulated signal sets can yield the same performance. Other considerations determine how signal set
choice aﬀects digital communication performance.
