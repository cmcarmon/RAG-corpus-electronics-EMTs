The Trouton–Noble paradox is essentially equivalent to a thought experiment called "right angle lever paradox", first discussed by Gilbert Newton Lewis and Richard Chase Tolman in 1909. Suppose a right-angle lever with endpoints abc. In its rest frame, the forces




f

y




{\displaystyle f_{y}}
towards ba and




f

x




{\displaystyle f_{x}}
towards bc must be equal to obtain equilibrium, thus no torque is given by the law of the lever:





τ

(

)

=
0


{\displaystyle \tau '=L_{0}\left(f'_{x}-f'_{y}\right)=0}

where



τ


{\displaystyle \tau }
is the torque, and




L

0




{\displaystyle L_{0}}
the rest length of one lever arm. However, due to length contraction, ba is longer than bc in a non-co-moving system, thus the law of the lever gives:




τ

{\displaystyle \tau =f_{x}\cdot L_{0}-f_{y}\cdot L_{0}{\sqrt {1-{\frac {v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}=L_{0}\left(f_{x}-f_{y}{\sqrt {1-{\frac {v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}\right)}

It can be seen that the torque is not zero, which apparently would cause the lever to rotate in the non-co-moving frame. Since no rotation is observed, Lewis and Tolman thus concluded that no torque exists, therefore:







f

f

y




=

−



v

c

{\displaystyle {\frac {f_{x}}{f_{y}}}={\sqrt {1-{\frac {v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}}

However, as shown by Max von Laue (1911), this is in contradiction with the relativistic expressions of force,

{\displaystyle f_{x}=f'_{x},\ f_{y}=f'_{y}\cdot {\sqrt {1-{\frac {v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}}

which gives

=

{\displaystyle {\frac {f_{x}}{f_{y}}}={\frac {1}{\sqrt {1-{\frac {v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}}}

When applied to the law of the lever, the following torque is produced:

{\displaystyle \tau =-L_{0}\cdot f'_{x}\cdot {\frac {v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}

Which is principally the same problem as in the Trouton-Noble paradox.
