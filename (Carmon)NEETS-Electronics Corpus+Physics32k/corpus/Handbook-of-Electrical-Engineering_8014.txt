The blending of microelectronics and computers has produced the microprocessor, the computer on
a chip. This has made possible tremendous reductions in computer size and cost, and consequently has
made computers far more available for previously undreamed-of applications. Not since the develop-
ment  of  electric  power  systems  began  over  one  hundred  years  ago  have  engineers  produced  such  a
fundamental and far-reaching tool for change. (Courtesy of the IEEE Center for the History of Electrical
