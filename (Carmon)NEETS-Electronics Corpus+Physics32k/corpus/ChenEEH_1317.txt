IEEE 1394
The IEEE 1394 is a high-performance serial bus. App de-
veloped the bus in early 1990s and called it Fire Wire bus.
Sony also markets a similar product under the name i.Link,
which is one of many 1394-compliant devices. Because of
USBâ€™s low speed, it does not provide support for high-speed
peripherals, such as digital camcorders and high performance
printers. IEEE 1394 can support these high-speed peripherals.
IEEE 1394 is the only bus structure that can be used as an
internal bus and an external bus in a computer system.
