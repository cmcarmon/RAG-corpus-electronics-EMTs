High-Dimensionality and Dimension Reduction
It is obvious from the discussion thus far that content-based
image retrieval is a high-dimensional feature vector-matching
problem. To make the systems truly scalable to large size image
collections, two factors should be considered. First, the dimen-
sionality of the feature space needs to be reduced to achieve the
embedded dimension. Second, efÔ¨Åcient and scalable multidi-
mensional indexing techniques need to be adapted to index the
reduced but still high-dimensional feature space. In the context
of dimensionality reduction, a transformation of the original
data set using the Karhunen-Loeve transform (KLT) can be
used. KLT features data-dependent basis functions obtained
from a given data set and achieves the theoretical ideal in terms
of compressing the data set. An approximation to KLT given by
principal component analysis (PCA) gives a very practical
solution to the computationally intensive process of KLT.
PCA, introduced by Pearson in 1901 and developed independ-
ently by Hotelling in 1933, is probably the oldest and best
known of the techniques of multivariate analysis. The central
idea of PCA is to reduce the dimensionality of a data set in
which there are a large number of interrelated variables while
retaining as much as possible of the variation present in the
data set. This reduction is achieved by transforming to a new
