As the electrons work their way through the thin metal Ô¨Ålament of the lamp, they encounter
more opposition to motion than they typically would in a thick piece of wire. This opposition to
electric current depends on the type of material, its cross-sectional area, and its temperature.
It is technically known as resistance. (It can be said that conductors have low resistance and
insulators have very high resistance.) This resistance serves to limit the amount of current
through the circuit with a given amount of voltage supplied by the battery, as compared with
