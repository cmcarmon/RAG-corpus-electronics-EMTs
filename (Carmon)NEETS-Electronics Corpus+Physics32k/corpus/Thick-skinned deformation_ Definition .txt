Deformation in geology refers to any alterations to the size or shape of a rock formation since the time of its creation. There are many different ways deformation can occur but it is always the result of some amount of stress within a formation. This stress leads to the formation of many structures that can either extend or shorten the length of the crust in the area. Some of the most common structures are faults and folds. Thick-skinned deformation is a specific type of deformation that can take the form of either faults or folds. The term thick-skinned specifically applies type of deformation which affects not only the sedimentary and metamorphic cover rocks near the surface but also affects the much deeper crystalline rock of the basement and may extend even deeper into the lower crust. Thin-skinned deformation is the counterpart to thick-skinned deformation and can frequently be found in similar areas. As the term implies, thin-skinned deformation is deformation that only affects the upper layers of the cover rocks and does not continue into the deeper basement. There is also one other term which may be used as an intermediary between these two extremes. The term basement-involved thin-skinned deformation can be applied to deformation that affects the cover rocks and may cut some into the basement then level off before going too deep.
