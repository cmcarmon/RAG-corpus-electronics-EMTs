For example, if 5 volts were applied to the primary of a 1:3 step-up transformer, the secondary would
produce 15 volts. In other words, the input voltage was amplified by a factor of 3. When applied to
electronic circuits, these primary and secondary voltages are more often called signals, or input and
output signal, respectively. In electronics, the amplitude of an input signal must sometimes be increased
many times-often, hundreds or thousands of times!
