reaches or exceeds its breakdown voltage, the Zener diode suddenly starts 
conducting current backward through the diode (from cathode to anode). As 
you continue to increase the reverse‐biased voltage beyond the breakdown 
point, the Zener continues to conduct more and more current — while main­
taining a steady voltage drop.
