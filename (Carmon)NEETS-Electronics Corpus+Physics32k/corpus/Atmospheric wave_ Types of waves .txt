Because the propagation of the wave is fundamentally caused by an imbalance of the forces acting on the air (which is often thought of in terms of air parcels when considering wave motion), the types of waves and their propagation characteristics vary latitudinally, principally because the Coriolis effect on horizontal flow is maximal at the poles and zero at the equator.
The different wave types are:
sound waves (usually eliminated from the atmospheric equations of motion due to their high frequency)
These are longitudinal or compression waves. The sound wave propagates in the atmosphere though a series of compressions and expansions parallel to the direction of propagation.
internal gravity waves (require stable stratification of the atmosphere)
inertio-gravity waves (also include a significant Coriolis effect as opposed to "normal" gravity waves)
Rossby waves (can be seen in the troughs and ridges of 500 hPa geopotential caused by midlatitude cyclones and anticyclones)
At the equator, mixed Rossby-gravity and Kelvin waves can also be observed.
