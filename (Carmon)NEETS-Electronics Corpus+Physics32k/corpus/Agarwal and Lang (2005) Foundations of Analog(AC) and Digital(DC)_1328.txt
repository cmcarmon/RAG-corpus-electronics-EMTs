Before ending this subsection, it is worthwhile to comment on impulse
sources. Since impulses are a mathematical invention, and not a physical occur-
rence,
it might appear that they have limited practical value. However, this
is not the case. We often encounter sources that produce very narrow pulses
of voltage or current. When these pulses are so narrow that we do not really
care about the details of their shape, then we can model them very simply
by an impulse with an equivalent area. From a mathematical viewpoint, this
offers a significant savings since an impulse source is much easier to deal with
than a source that produces a pulse with a complex shape. Thus, impulses are
actually very useful modeling tools.
