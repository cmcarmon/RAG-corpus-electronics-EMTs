Certain other factors have to be considered when obtaining the optimum generation pattern. One is that
the  generation  pattern  provide  adequate  reserve  margins.  This  is  often  done  by  constraining  the  generation
level to a lower boundary than the generating capability. A more difﬁcult set of constraints to consider are the
transmission limits. Under certain real-time conditions it is possible that the most economic pattern may not
be feasible because of unacceptable line ﬂows or voltage conditions. The present-day economic dispatch (ED)
algorithm  cannot  handle  these  security  constraints.  However,  alternative  methods  based  on  optimal  power
ﬂows have been suggested but have not yet been used for real-time dispatch.
