What we see here is the basis for switching lamps on and off by remote switches. Because
any break in a circuit’s continuity results in current stopping throughout the entire circuit, we
can use a device designed to intentionally break that continuity (called a switch), mounted at
any convenient location that we can run wires to, to control the ﬂow of electrons in the circuit:
