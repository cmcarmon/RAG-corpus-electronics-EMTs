When the external circuit is removed, the current ceases to flow, and, theoretically, all chemical 
action within the cell stops. However, commercial zinc contains many impurities, such as iron, carbon, 
lead, and arsenic. These impurities form many small electrical cells within the zinc electrode in which 
current flows between the zinc and its impurities. Thus, the chemical action continues even though the 
cell itself is not connected to a load.
