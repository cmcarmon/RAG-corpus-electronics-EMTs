Solderâ€”Ordinary soft solder is a fusible alloy of tin and lead used to join two or more metals at 
temperatures below their melting point. The metal solvent action that occurs when copper conductors are 
soldered together takes place because a small amount of the copper combines with the solder to form a 
new alloy. Therefore, the joint is one common metal. The tin-lead alloy used for general-purpose 
soldering is composed of 60-percent tin and 40-percent lead (60/40 solder).
