The Australian National Measurement Institute tested the accuracy of the vehicle velocity measurement. They found that there was a 1% deviation at 156 miles per hour (251 km/h).
TIRTL was reviewed by the Minnesota Department of Transportation. In conjunction with 16 participating state departments of transportation, they conducted a pooled fund study called Portable Non-Intrusive Traffic Detection System (PNITDS). The final report stated that TIRTL correctly classified 94% and 97% of the total vehicles polled.
TIRTL is under review by the Hawaii Department of Transportation for use as the chief sensor in their traffic monitoring system. The system is in competition with other non-intrusive traffic collection devices.
In November 2008, the state of New South Wales, Australia, approved the device for use as a sensor for speed measurement.
