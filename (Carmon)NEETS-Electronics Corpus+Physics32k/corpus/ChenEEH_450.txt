The basic operation principle can be derived already for the
1-D structure under the emitter. Classical transistor theory
is discussed ﬁrst; however,
it becomes invalid at medium
to high current densities because in all practical transistors,
NC  NB, so that more general equations are also presented.
To allow a generic representation of the typical characteristics
and a comparison of technologies, a collector current density
JC ¼ IC=AE is used in the following considerations, where AE
is the (effective) emitter area that is larger than the emitter
window area AE0. The controlling terminal voltages of the 1-D
transistor are denoted as VB0E0 and VB0C0 .
