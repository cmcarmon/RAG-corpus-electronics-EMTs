Rossby-gravity waves, first observed in the stratosphere by M. Yanai, always carry energy eastward. But, oddly, their 'crests' and 'troughs' may propagate westward if their periods are long enough. The eastward speed of propagation of these waves can be derived for an inviscid slowly moving layer of fluid of uniform depth H. Because the Coriolis parameter (ƒ = 2Ω sin(θ) where Ω is the angular velocity of the earth, 7.2921

10−5 rad/s, and θ is latitude) vanishes at 0 degrees latitude (equator), the “equatorial beta plane” approximation must be made. This approximation states that “f” is approximately equal to βy, where “y” is the distance from the equator and "β" is the variation of the coriolis parameter with latitude,

The Yanai modes, together with the Kelvin waves described in the next section, are rather special in that they are topologically protected. Their existence is guaranteed by the fact that the band of positive frequency Poincaré modes in the f-plane form a non-trivial bundle over the two-sphere

{\displaystyle c_{1}=-2.}
Through the bulk-boundary connection this necessitates the existence of two modes (Kelvin and Yanai) that cross the frequency gaps between the Poincaré and Rossby bands and are localized near the equator where
