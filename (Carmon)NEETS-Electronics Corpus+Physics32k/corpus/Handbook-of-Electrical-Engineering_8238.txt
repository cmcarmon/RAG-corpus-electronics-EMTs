The  data  acquisition  system  must  be  designed  to  match  the  process  being  measured  as  well  as  the  end-user
requirements. The nature of the process is mainly characterized by its speed and number of measuring points,
whereas the end-user requirement is mainly the ﬂexibility in control. Certain processes require data acquisition
with no interruption where computers are used in controlling. On the other hand, there are cases where the
acquisition starts at a certain instance and continues for a deﬁnite period. In this case the acquisition cycle is
repeated in a periodic manner, and it can be controlled manually or by software. Controllers access the process
via the analog and digital interface submodules, which are sometimes called analog and digital front ends.
