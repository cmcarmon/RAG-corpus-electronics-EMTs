There’s a sure way to calculate any of the values in a reactive DC circuit over time. The
ﬁrst step is to identify the starting and ﬁnal values for whatever quantity the capacitor or
inductor opposes change in; that is, whatever quantity the reactive component is trying to hold
constant. For capacitors, this quantity is voltage; for inductors, this quantity is current. When
the switch in a circuit is closed (or opened), the reactive component will attempt to maintain
that quantity at the same level as it was before the switch transition, so that value is to be
used for the ”starting” value. The ﬁnal value for this quantity is whatever that quantity will
be after an inﬁnite amount of time. This can be determined by analyzing a capacitive circuit as
