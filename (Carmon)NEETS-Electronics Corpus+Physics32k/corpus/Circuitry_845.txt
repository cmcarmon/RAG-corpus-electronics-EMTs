1.  Carefully examine a copy of the circuit diagram. 
  Mark all components  which  are to be mounted 
‘off-board’ and, using appropriate letters and/or 
 
 
numbers (e.g. SK1, pin-2), identify all points at 
  which an ‘off-board’ connection is to be made. 
2.  Identify  any  multiple  connections  (e.g.  bus 
lines)  required  between  integrated  circuits  or 
 
 
between integrated circuits and edge connectors. 
  Arrange such components in physical proximity 
 
and  with  such  orientation  that  will  effectively 
  minimize the number of links required. 
3.  Identify  components

4.  Keep inputs and outputs at opposite ends of the 
  PCB  wherever  possible.  This  not  only  helps 
  maintain  a  logical  circuit  layout  (progressing 
from  input)  but,  in  high  gain  circuits,  it  may 
 
also  be  instrumental  in  preventing  instability 
 
 
due to unwanted feedback. 
5.  Use  the  minimum  board  area  consistent  with  a 
layout  which  is  uncramped.  In  practice,  and  to 
 
prevent  wastage,  you  should  aim  to  utilize  as 
 
 
high  a  proportion  of  the  PCB  surface  area  as
