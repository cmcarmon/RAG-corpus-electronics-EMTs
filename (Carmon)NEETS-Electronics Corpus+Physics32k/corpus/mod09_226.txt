Notice that point R is the input to the base of the common-emitter amplifier. Also, vector LR shows 
that the signal on the base is regenerative (aiding the circuit operation). This meets the regenerative 
feedback requirement. An exact 60-degree phase shift per stage is not required, but the sum of the three 
phase shifts must equal 180 degrees.
