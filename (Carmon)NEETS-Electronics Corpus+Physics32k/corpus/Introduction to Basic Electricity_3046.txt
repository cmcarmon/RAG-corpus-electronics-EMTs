All Pâ€“N junction diodes produce a small leak-
age current. In germanium diodes, it is measured in 
microamperes; in silicon diodes, it is measured in 
nanoamperes. Germanium has more leakage  current 
because it is more sensitive to temperature. This 
 disadvantage of germanium is offset by its smaller 
barrier voltage.
