The operation is summarized in the truth table in Fig. 79.8(d), identifying the circuit as a two-input NAND
gate.  The  derivation  of  the  input-output  voltage  transfer  characteristic  [Fig. 79.8(c)],  where Vi  is  applied  to
inputs  A  and  B  simultaneously,  can  be  found  in  most  digital  circuit  textbooks.  The  sloping  portion  of  the
characteristic between Vi = 0.55 and 1.2 V corresponds to T2 passing through the active region in going from
cutoff to saturation.
