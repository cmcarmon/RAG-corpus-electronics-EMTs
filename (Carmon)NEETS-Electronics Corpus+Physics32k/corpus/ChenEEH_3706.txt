Cepstral analysis is a special case within a class of methods
collectively known as homomorphic signal processing. His-
torically, the discovery and use of the cepstrum by Bogert,
Healy, and Tukey (1963) and Noll (1967) predate the formula-
tion of the more general homomorphic SP approach by
Oppenheim and Schafer (1968). In fact, the earlier cepstrum
is a special case of a more general cepstrum, which, in turn, is a
special instance of homomorphic processing. When it is not
clear from context, the cepstrum derived from homomorphic
processing is called the complex cepstrum (even though the
version of it used is ordinarily real-valued!), while the original
Bogert–Tukey–Healy cepstrum is called the real cepstrum.
