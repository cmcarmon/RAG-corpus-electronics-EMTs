In  addition  to  the  CPU,  there  are  a  number  of  other  components  in  a  microcomputer.  General-purpose
memory  is  not  typically  part  of  the  microprocessor  but  must  be  added  as  a  separate  component.  In  simple
microcomputers, the memory may be directly attached to the microprocessor. In more complex designs, the
memory  is  attached  to  the  microprocessor  by  a  system  bus  that  allows  system  components  other  than  the
microprocessor to access memory as well. In addition, the memory may have its own controller, called a memory
management unit.
