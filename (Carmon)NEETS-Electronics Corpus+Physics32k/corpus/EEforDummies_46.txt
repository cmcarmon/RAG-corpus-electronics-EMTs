Electric current, sometimes known as electricity (see the sidebar “What is 
electricity?”), is the movement in the same direction of microscopically 
small, electrically charged particles called electrons. So where exactly do you 
find electrons, and how do they move around? You’ll find the answers by 
taking a peek inside the atom.
