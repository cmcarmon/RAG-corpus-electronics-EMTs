Two 
transfer  functions  are  usually 
supported.  One  of  these  determines  the  voltage 
transfer  function  (i.e.  output  voltage  divided  by 
input  voltage)  and  the  other  usually  computes  the 
output transimpedance (i.e. output voltage divided 
by input current) or transconductance (i.e. output 
current  divided  by  input  voltage).  These  two 
transfer  functions  cover  all  the  cases  and  one  can
