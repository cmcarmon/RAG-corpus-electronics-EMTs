4. The eï¬€ects of a Zener diode in a circuit can be treated analytically by using an equiv-
alent circuit model of the reverse-biased condition. In the low voltage region, before
breakdown, the Zener diode can be treated like any other reverse-biased diode. How-
ever, the Zener diode is normally operated in the breakdown region.
