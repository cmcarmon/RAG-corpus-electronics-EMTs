Shunt resistors are made with close tolerances. That means if a shunt resistor is selected with a
resistance of .01 ohms (as R1  in fig. 1-22), the actual resistance of that shunt resistor will not vary from
that value by more than 1 percent. Since a shunt resistor is used to protect a meter movement and to allow
accurate measurement, it is important that the resistance of the shunt resistor is known very accurately.
