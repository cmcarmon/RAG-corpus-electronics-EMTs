We will consider semiconductor diodes made out of silicon. Recall, we have
previously seen an example of a silicon-based device, namely the MOSFET. Let
us first review briefly the properties of silicon and semiconductors. Silicon is an
element in the cubic crystal class of Group IV in the periodic table (along with
germanium). In pure crystalline silicon, each atom forms covalent bonds with
its nearest neighbors, so that at room temperature almost all valence electrons
are involved in the structural bonding, and very few are free to move about
the crystal. Hence pure silicon at room temperature is a very poor conductor
of electricity.
