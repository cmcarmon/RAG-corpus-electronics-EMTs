In 1905 Einstein made use of the non-Galilean character of Maxwell's equations to develop his theory of special relativity. The special property embedded in Maxwell's equations is known as the Lorentz invariance. In Maxwell's equations frame, assuming that the speed of moving charges is small compared to the speed of light, it is possible to derive approximations that fulfill Galilean invariance. This approach enables the rigorous definition of two main mutually exclusive limits known as quasi-electrostatics (electrostatics with displacement currents or ohmic currents) and quasi-magnetostatics (magnetostatics with electric field caused by variation of magnetic field according to Faraday's law, or by ohmic currents).    Quasi-static approximations are often poorly introduced in literature as stated for instance in Hauss & Melcher. They are often presented as a single one whereas Galilean electromagnetism shows that the two regimes are in general mutually exclusive. According to Rousseaux, the existence of these two exclusive limits explains why electromagnetism as long been thought to be incompatible with Galilean transformations. However Galilean transformations applying in both cases (magnetic limit and electric limit) were known by engineers before the topic was discussed by Levy Leblond. These transformations are found in Woodson and Melcher's 1968 book.
If the transit time of the electromagnetic wave passing through the system is much less than a typical time scale of the system, then Maxwell equations can be reduced to one of the galilean limits. For instance, for dielectrical liquids it is quasielectrostatics, and for highly conducting liquids quasimagnetostatics.
