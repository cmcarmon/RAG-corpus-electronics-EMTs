A solderless breadboard is a reusable rectangular plastic board that contains 
several hundred square sockets, or contact holes, into which you plug com-
ponents such as resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, and integrated 
circuits. Groups of contact holes are electrically connected by flexible metal 
strips running below the surface. The photo in Figure 2-8 shows part of an 
830‚Äêcontact solderless breadboard with yellow lines added to help you visu-
alize the underlying connections between contact holes.
