Despite being released 2 years after the album became available, the single reached number 15 in the UK in 1979, becoming his first top 20 UK hit and the highest charting song off the Bat Out of Hell album  and was reissued in December 1993 following the huge chart success of "I'd Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)" in 1993. This time it reached number 8 giving Meat Loaf two singles in the UK Top Ten at the same time - a feat not repeated by any artist until 2002.
