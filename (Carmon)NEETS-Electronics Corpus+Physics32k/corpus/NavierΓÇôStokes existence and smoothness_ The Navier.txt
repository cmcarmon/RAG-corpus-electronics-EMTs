In mathematics, the Navier–Stokes equations are a system of nonlinear partial differential equations for abstract vector fields of any size. In physics and engineering, they are a system of equations that models the motion of liquids or non-rarefied gases (in which the mean free path is short enough so that it can be thought of as a continuum mean instead of a collection of particles) using continuum mechanics. The equations are a statement of Newton's second law, with the forces modeled according to those in a viscous Newtonian fluid—as the sum of contributions by pressure, viscous stress and an external body force. Since the setting of the problem proposed by the Clay Mathematics Institute is in three dimensions, for an incompressible and homogeneous fluid, only that case is considered below.
Let




v

(

x

,
t
)


{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} ({\boldsymbol {x}},t)}
be a 3-dimensional vector field, the velocity of the fluid, and let



p
(

x

,
t
)


{\displaystyle p({\boldsymbol {x}},t)}
be the pressure of the fluid. The Navier–Stokes equations are:

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \mathbf {v} }{\partial t}}+(\mathbf {v} \cdot \nabla )\mathbf {v} =-\nabla p+\nu \Delta \mathbf {v} +\mathbf {f} ({\boldsymbol {x}},t)}

where



ν

{\displaystyle \nu >0}
is the kinematic viscosity,




f

(

x

,
t
)


{\displaystyle \mathbf {f} ({\boldsymbol {x}},t)}
the external volumetric force,



∇


{\displaystyle \nabla }
is the gradient operator and




Δ



{\displaystyle \displaystyle \Delta }
is the Laplacian operator, which is also denoted by



∇
⋅
∇


{\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \nabla }
or




∇

{\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}}
. Note that this is a vector equation, i.e. it has three scalar equations. Writing down the coordinates of the velocity and the external force

{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} ({\boldsymbol {x}},t)={\big (}\,v_{1}({\boldsymbol {x}},t),\,v_{2}({\boldsymbol {x}},t),\,v_{3}({\boldsymbol {x}},t)\,{\big )}\,,\qquad \mathbf {f} ({\boldsymbol {x}},t)={\big (}\,f_{1}({\boldsymbol {x}},t),\,f_{2}({\boldsymbol {x}},t),\,f_{3}({\boldsymbol {x}},t)\,{\big )}}

then for each

The unknowns are the velocity




v

(

x

,
t
)


{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} ({\boldsymbol {x}},t)}
and the pressure



p
(

x

,
t
)


{\displaystyle p({\boldsymbol {x}},t)}
. Since in three dimensions, there are three equations and four unknowns (three scalar velocities and the pressure), then a supplementary equation is needed. This extra equation is the continuity equation for incompressible fluids that describes the conservation of mass of the fluid:




∇
⋅

v

=
0.


{\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf {v} =0.}

Due to this last property, the solutions for the Navier–Stokes equations are searched in the set of solenoidal ("divergence-free") functions. For this flow of a homogeneous medium, density and viscosity are constants.
The pressure p can be eliminated by taking an operator rot (alternative notation curl) of both sides of the Navier–Stokes equations. In this case the Navier–Stokes equations reduce to the vorticity-transport equations.
