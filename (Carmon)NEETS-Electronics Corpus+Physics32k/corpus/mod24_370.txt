Polishing the fiber ends removes most surface imperfections introduced by the fiber cleaving
process. Fiber polishing begins by inserting the cleaved fiber into the ferrule of a connector assembly. A
ferrule is a fixture, generally a rigid tube, used to hold the stripped end of an optical fiber in a fiber optic
connector. An individual fiber is epoxied within the ferrule. The connector with the optical fiber
cemented within the ferrule can then be mounted into a special polishing tool for polishing.
