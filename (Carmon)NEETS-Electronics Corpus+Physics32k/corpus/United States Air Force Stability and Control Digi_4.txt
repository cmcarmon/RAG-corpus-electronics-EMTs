Digital DATCOM produces a copious amount of data for the relatively small amount of inputs it requires. By default, only the data for the aircraft is output, but additional configurations can be output:
Body alone
Wing alone
Horizontal tail alone
Vertical tail alone
Wing-Body Configuration
Body-Horizontal Tail Configuration
Body-Vertical Tail Configuration
Wing-Body-Horizontal Tail Configuration
Wing-Body-Vertical Tail Configuration
Wing-Body-Horizontal Tail-Vertical Tail Configuration
For each configuration, stability coefficients and derivatives are output at each angle of attack specified. The details of this output are defined in Section 6 of the USAF Digital DATCOM Manual Volume I. The basic output includes:
CL - Lift Coefficient
CD - Drag Coefficient
Cm - Pitching Moment Coefficient
CN - Normal Force Coefficient
CA - Axial Force Coefficient
CLα - Lift Curve Slope (Derivative of Lift Coefficient with respect to angle of attack)
Cmα - Pitching Moment Curve Slope (derivative of Pitching Moment Coefficient with respect to angle of attack)
CYβ - Derivative of side-force coefficient with respect to sideslip angle
Cnβ - Derivative of yawing-moment coefficient with respect to sideslip angle
Clβ - Derivative of rolling-moment coefficient with respect to sideslip angle
For complete aircraft configurations, downwash data is also included.
When compared with modern methods of computational fluid dynamics, Digital DATCOM may seem antiquated. However, in its day, the program was an advanced estimation tool, and certainly much faster than plowing through pages and pages of engineering texts. Digital DATCOM is no longer supported by the USAF and is now public domain software.
