We may use these two relations to considerably simplify our approach to the minor-loop design problem.
For illustrative purposes, we will use two major-loop gain functions. First we will consider the major-loop gain
with the minor-loop-compensating network removed such that G4(s) = 0. This represents the standard situation
we have examined in the last subsection. This uncompensated major-loop transfer function is
