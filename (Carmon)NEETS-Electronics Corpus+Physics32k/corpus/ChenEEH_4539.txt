The precise form of the component connection model with
its algebraic description of a systemâ€™s connection information
may be seen by examining Figure 7.1. Figure 7.1(A) shows a
box depiction of a system with inputs u and outputs y. The
inner box labeled Z represents the system components, and the
outer donut shaped area represents the system connections
(e.g., scalers, adders, Kirchhoff law constraints, etc.). Now, if
Z represents a matrix of component input/output relations,
the following may be abstractly written:
