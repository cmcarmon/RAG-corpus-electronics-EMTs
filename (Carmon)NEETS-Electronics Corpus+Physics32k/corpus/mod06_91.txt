INDIRECTLY HEATED.â€”Figure 1-7 shows this type of cathode and its schematic symbol.
Indirectly heated cathodes are always composed of oxide-coated material. The cathode is a cylinder, a
kind of sleeve, that encloses the twisted wire filament. The only function of the filament is to heat the
cathode. The filament is often called a heater when used in this manner.
