The dielectric loss behavior may be phenomenologically described by the Pellat-Debye equations, relating
the imaginary and real values of the permittivity to the relaxation time, t, of the loss process (i.e., the frequency
at which the e† peak appears: fo = 1/2 pt), the low-frequency or static value of the real permittivity, es, and the
high- or optical-frequency value of the real permittivity, e‘. Thus, for a loss process characterized by a single
relaxation time
