Extraction (as Opposed to Optimization)
The  terms  “extraction”  and  “optimization”  are,  unfortunately,  used  interchangeably  in  the  semiconductor
industry; however, strictly speaking, they are not the same. By optimization, we mean using generalized least-
squares curve ﬁtting methods such as the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm [Gill et al., 1981] to ﬁnd a set of
model parameters. By extraction, we mean any technique that does not use general least-squares ﬁtting methods.
This is a somewhat loose interpretation of the term extraction. The main point is that we write the equations
we want and then solve them by whatever approximations we choose, as long as these approximations allow
us to get the extracted results in closed form. This is parameter extraction.
