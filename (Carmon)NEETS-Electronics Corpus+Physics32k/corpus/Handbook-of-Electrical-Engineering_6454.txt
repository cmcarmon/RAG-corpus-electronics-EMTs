If we look at the second term in the denominator of Eq. (70.15), we see that the ratio J/S is divided by M.
Realizing  that  J/S  is  the  ratio  of  the  jammer  power  to  the  signal  power  before  despreading,  and J/MS  is  the
ratio  of  the  same  quantity  after  despreading,  we  see  that,  as  was  the  case  for  noise  jamming,  the  beneÔ¨Åt  of
employing direct sequence spread spectrum signalling in the presence of tone jamming is to reduce the effect
of the jammer by an amount on the order of the processing gain.
