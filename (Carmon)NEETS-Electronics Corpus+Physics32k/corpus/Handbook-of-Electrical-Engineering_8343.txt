An alternative to using boundary scan is to use a “traditional” in-circuit tester that uses a special “bed-of-
nails” ﬁxture. In this approach [Parker, 1987], every net on a PCB would be probed using a tester pin which
comes in physical contact with that net such that the current signal value of the net can be observed by the
tester. The tester can also be used to control the signal values of the individual nets by injecting appropriate
currents through the tester pins. However, since each net is already connected to an output pin of a component
on the PCB, this approach amounts to backdriving the output drivers of IC components and therefore poses a
potential  risk  of  damage  to  the  IC  components.  This  approach  is  becoming  more  difﬁcult  and/or  costly  to
implement  as  the  number  of  nets  goes  up  and  IC  pin  spacing  is  reduced.  Furthermore,  due  to  ﬁxturing
difﬁculties,  double-sided  PCBs  cannot  be  tested  in  this  manner.  The  IEEE  1149.1  boundary-scan  standard
[IEEE,  1990]  helps  solve  these  problems  by  providing  convenient  direct  access  to  the  I/O  pins  of  an  IC
component without requiring the traditional bed-of-nails ﬁxture.
