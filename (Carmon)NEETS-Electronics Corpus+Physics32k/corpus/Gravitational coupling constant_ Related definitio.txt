Let μ = mp/me = 1836.15267247(80) be the dimensionless proton-to-electron mass ratio, the ratio of the rest mass of the proton to that of the electron. Other definitions of αG that have been proposed in the literature differ from the one above merely by a factor of μ or its square;
If αG is defined using the mass of one electron, me, and one proton (mp = μme), then αG = 1.752×10−45μ = 3.217×10−42, and α/αG ≈ 1039. α/αG defined in this manner is C in Eddington (1935: 232), with Planck's constant replacing the "reduced" Planck constant;
(4.5) in Barrow and Tipler (1986) tacitly defines α/αG as e2/Gmpme ≈ 1039. Even though they do not name the α/αG defined in this manner, it nevertheless plays a role in their broad-ranging discussion of astrophysics, cosmology, quantum physics, and the anthropic principle;
N in Rees (2000) is α/αG = α/1.752×10−45μ2 = α/5.906×10−39 ≈ 1036, where the denominator is defined using a pair of protons.
