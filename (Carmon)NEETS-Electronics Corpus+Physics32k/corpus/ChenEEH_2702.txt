1. The Yee algorithm solves for both electric and magnetic
ﬁelds in time and space using the coupled Maxwell’s
curl equations rather than solving for the electric ﬁeld
alone (or the magnetic ﬁeld alone) with a wave equa-
tion.
. This is analogous to the combined-ﬁeld integral
equation formulation of the method of moments,
wherein both ~EE and ~HH boundary conditions are
enforced on the surface of a material structure.
