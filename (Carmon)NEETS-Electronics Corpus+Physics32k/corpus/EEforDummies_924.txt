Seeing yourself as a giant resistor
Your body exhibits some resistance to electrical current, mostly due to the 
poor conductive qualities of dry skin. The amount of resistance can vary tre-
mendously, depending on body chemistry, level of moisture in the skin, the 
total path across which resistance is measured, and other factors. You’ll see 
figures ranging anywhere from 50,000 ohms to 1,000,000 ohms of resistance 
for an average human being. (I discuss what resistance is and how it’s mea-
sured in Chapter 5.)
