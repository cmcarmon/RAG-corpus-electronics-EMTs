If a rigid body Q is rotating about any line through the center of mass then it has rotational kinetic energy (




E

r





{\displaystyle E_{\text{r}}\,}
) which is simply the sum of the kinetic energies of its moving parts, and is thus given by:

where:
ω is the body's angular velocity
r is the distance of any mass dm from that line




I



{\displaystyle I\,}
is the body's moment of inertia, equal to

(In this equation the moment of inertia must be taken about an axis through the center of mass and the rotation measured by ω must be around that axis; more general equations exist for systems where the object is subject to wobble due to its eccentric shape).
