As  new  satellites  are  launched,  they  will  have  long-term  applications  which  have  expanded  opportunities.
These include private long-haul networks for internal communications, cable TV, pay TV, business voice and
data,  satellite  news  gathering,  direct  broadcast  to  the  home,  integrated VSATs,  private  international  satellite
service, high-deÔ¨Ånition TV, mobile service, personal communications, and ISDN. Disaster recovery planning
increasingly includes satellites in order to overcome the coverage limitations of existing terrestrial networks.
With the allocation of frequencies for personal communications, the promise of global communications and
the reality of a personal phone will soon push satellite communications to a new age.
