Point-like sources separated by an angle smaller than the angular resolution cannot be resolved. A single optical telescope may have an angular resolution less than one arcsecond, but astronomical seeing and other atmospheric effects make attaining this very hard.
The angular resolution R of a telescope can usually be approximated by




R
=


λ
D




{\displaystyle R={\frac {\lambda }{D}}}

where λ is the wavelength of the observed radiation, and D is the diameter of the telescope's objective. The Resulting R is in radians. For example, in the case of yellow light with a wavelength of 580 nm, for a resolution of 0.1 arc second, we need D=1.2 m. Sources larger than the angular resolution are called extended sources or diffuse sources, and smaller sources are called point sources.
This formula, for light with a wavelength of about 562 nm, is also called the Dawes' limit.
