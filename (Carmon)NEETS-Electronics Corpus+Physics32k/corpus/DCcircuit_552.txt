It’s still the same series circuit, just with the components arranged in a different form.
Notice the polarities of the resistor voltage drops with respect to the battery: the battery’s
voltage is negative on the left and positive on the right, whereas all the resistor voltage drops
are oriented the other way: positive on the left and negative on the right. This is because the
resistors are resisting the ﬂow of electrons being pushed by the battery. In other words, the
”push” exerted by the resistors against the ﬂow of electrons must be in a direction opposite the
source of electromotive force.
