If two dissimilar substances (usually metals or metallic materials) are immersed in a solution that
produces a greater chemical action on one substance than on the other, a difference of potential will exist
between the two. If a conductor is then connected between them, electrons will flow through the
conductor to equalize the charge. This arrangement is called a primary cell. The two metallic pieces are
called electrodes and the solution is called the electrolyte. The voltaic cell illustrated in figure 1-23 is a
simple example of a primary cell. The difference of potential results from the fact that material from one
or both of the electrodes goes into solution in the electrolyte, and in the process, ions form in the vicinity
of the electrodes. Due to the electric field associated with the charged ions, the electrodes acquire charges.
