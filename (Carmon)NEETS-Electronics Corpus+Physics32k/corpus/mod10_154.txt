The speed of light depends on the medium through which the light travels. In empty space, the speed
is 186,000 (1.86 ·  105) miles per second. It is almost the same in air. In water, it slows down to
approximately 140,000 (1.4 ·  105) miles per second. In glass, the speed of light is 124,000 (1.24 ·  10 5)
miles per second. In other words, the speed of light decreases as the density of the substance through
which the light passes increases.
