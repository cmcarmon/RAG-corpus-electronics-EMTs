. High-level synthesis design methodology: The quest to
streamline the process of translating a complex algorithm
into a functional piece of silicon that meets the stringent
performance and costs constraints has led to signiﬁcant
progress in the area of high-level synthesis, system com-
pilation, and optimal code generation. Ideas such as data-
ﬂow modeling, loop unrolling, software pipelining, which
were originally developed for general purpose computing
systems, have enjoyed great success when applied to
aiding the synthesis of an application-speciﬁc signal pro-
cessing system from a high-level behavioral description.
. Multimedia processing architecture: With the maturity
and popularity of multimedia signal processing applica-
tions, general purpose microprocessors have incorporated
special-purpose architecture, such as the multimedia ex-
tension instruction set (e.g., MMX). Signal processors
also led the wave of a novel architectural concept such
as very long instruction word (VLIW) architecture. In
fact, it is argued that incorporating multimedia features
is the only way to sustain the exponential growth in
performance through the next decade.
