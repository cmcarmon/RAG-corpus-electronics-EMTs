Attribute Sets: Closed Subspaces
Much of the original research in signal restoration was concerned with the highly restrictive case in which each
of the individual attribute sets Ck is a closed subspace. The composite attribute set C as formed from their set
intersection (14.68) must therefore also be a closed subspace. For this special case there exists a useful analytical
characterization of the solution to the signal restoration problem (14.73). The notion of vector orthogonality
is  central  to  this  discussion.  In  particular,  the  two  vectors  x,y Ë›  X  are  said  to  be  orthogonal  if  their  inner
product is zero, that is,
