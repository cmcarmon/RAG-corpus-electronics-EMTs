An isochoric thermodynamic process is characterized by constant volume, i.e., ΔV = 0. The process does no pressure-volume work, since such work is defined by




Δ
W
=
P
Δ
V


{\displaystyle \Delta W=P\Delta V}
,
where P is pressure. The sign convention is such that positive work is performed by the system on the environment.
If the process is not quasi-static, the work can perhaps be done in a volume constant thermodynamic process.
For a reversible process, the first law of thermodynamics gives the change in the system's internal energy:




d
U
=
d
Q
−
d
W


{\displaystyle dU=dQ-dW}

Replacing work with a change in volume gives




d
U
=
d
Q
−
P
d
V


{\displaystyle dU=dQ-PdV}

Since the process is isochoric, dV = 0, the previous equation now gives




d
U
=
d
Q


{\displaystyle dU=dQ}

Using the definition of specific heat capacity at constant volume,

{\displaystyle C_{v}={\frac {dU}{dT}}}
,

{\displaystyle dQ=mc_{v}dT}

Integrating both sides yields

{\displaystyle \Delta Q\ =m\int _{T_{1}}^{T_{2}}\!c_{v}\,dT.}

Where cv is the specific heat capacity at constant volume, T1 is the initial temperature and T2 is the final temperature. We conclude with:

{\displaystyle \Delta Q\ =mc_{v}\Delta T\ }


On a pressure volume diagram, an isochoric process appears as a straight vertical line. Its thermodynamic conjugate, an isobaric process would appear as a straight horizontal line.
