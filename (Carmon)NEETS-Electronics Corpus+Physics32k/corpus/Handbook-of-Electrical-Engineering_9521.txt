The network’s DDL allows member records to be ordered in several ways. Member records can be sorted in
ascending  or  descending  order  according  to  one  or  more  ﬁelds. Alternatively,  a  new  member  record  can  be
inserted next (prior) to the current record (pointed to by the currency indicator) in the set instance. A newly
inserted member record can also be placed ﬁrst (or last) in the set instance. This will lead to a chronological
(or reverse chronological) order among member records.
