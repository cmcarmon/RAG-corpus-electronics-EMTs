Between 1665 and 1666, Isaac Newton developed several concepts related to motion, gravitation and differential calculus. However, these concepts were not published until 1687 in the Principia, in which he outlined his laws of motion and his law of universal gravitation. His second of his three laws of motion states:

The acceleration of a body is parallel and directly proportional to the net force acting on the body, is in the direction of the net force, and is inversely proportional to the mass of the body:





F

=
m

a

=
m




d

2



r



d

t

2







{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =m\mathbf {a} =m{\frac {d^{2}\mathbf {r} }{dt^{2}}}}

Where:





F



{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} }
is the force vector




m


{\displaystyle m}
is the mass of the body on which the force is acting





a



{\displaystyle \mathbf {a} }
is the acceleration vector, the second time derivative of the position vector




r



{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }


Strictly speaking, this form of the equation only applies to an object of constant mass, which holds true based on the simplifying assumptions made below.

Newton's law of gravitation states:

Every point mass attracts every other point mass by a force pointing along the line intersecting both points. The force is proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the point masses:




F
=
G




m

1



m

2




r

2






{\displaystyle F=G{\frac {m_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}}}

where:




F


{\displaystyle F}
is the magnitude of the gravitational force between the two point masses




G


{\displaystyle G}
is the gravitational constant





m

1




{\displaystyle m_{1}}
is the mass of the first point mass





m

2




{\displaystyle m_{2}}
is the mass of the second point mass




r


{\displaystyle r}
is the distance between the two point masses

From the laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation, Newton was able to derive Kepler's laws, demonstrating consistency between observation and theory. The laws of Kepler and Newton formed the basis of modern celestial mechanics until Albert Einstein introduced the concepts of special and general relativity in the early 20th century. For most applications, Keplerian motion approximates the motions of planets and satellites to relatively high degrees of accuracy and is used extensively in astronomy and astrodynamics.
