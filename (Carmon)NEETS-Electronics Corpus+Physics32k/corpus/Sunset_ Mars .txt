On Mars, the setting Sun appears about two-thirds the size it appears on Earth because of its greater distance from the Sun, but at least some Martian sunsets last significantly longer and appear far redder than is typical on Earth.
The reasons for the colors of the Martian sunset are different to the processes occurring on Earth. Mars has a thin atmosphere, lacking oxygen and nitrogen, so the light scattering is not dominated by a Rayleigh Scattering process. Instead the air is full of red dust which is hoisted into the atmosphere from the ground by high speed winds  so its sky color is mainly determined by a Mie Scattering process. One study also reported that Martian dust high up in the atmosphere can reflect sunlight up to two hours after the sun has set, casting a diffuse glow across the land.
