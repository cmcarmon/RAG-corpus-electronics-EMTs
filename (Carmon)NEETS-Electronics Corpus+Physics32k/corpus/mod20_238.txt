GAIN-BANDWIDTH PRODUCTÂ—The number that results when the gain of a circuit is multiplied by the 
bandwidth of that circuit. For an operational amplifier, the gain-bandwidth product for one 
configuration will always equal the gain-bandwidth product for any other configuration of the same 
amplifier [8].
