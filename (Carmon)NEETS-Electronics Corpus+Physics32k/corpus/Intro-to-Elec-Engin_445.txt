Inverting Summing Ampliﬁer
The circuit of Figure 5.4.1 is extended by adding other input points, as shown in Figure 5.4.3.
Because of the virtual ground at terminal 1 (ideal op-amp assumption), the response of the circuit
to any one input is not affected by the presence of the other N − 1 inputs. Based on Equation
(5.4.7) one can write the total output as the sum of all responses,
