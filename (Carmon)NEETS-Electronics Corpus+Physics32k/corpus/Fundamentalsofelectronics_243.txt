The node method applies to RLC circuits, without signiﬁcant modiﬁcation from the methods used on simple
resistive circuits, if we use complex amplitudes. We rely on the fact that complex amplitudes satisfy KVL,
KCL, and impedance-based v-i relations. In the example circuit shown in Figure 3.34, we deﬁne complex
amplitudes for the input and output variables and for the node voltages. We need only one node voltage
here, and its KCL equation is
