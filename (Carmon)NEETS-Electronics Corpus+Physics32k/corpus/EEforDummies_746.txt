By connecting a few resistors, capacitors, and switches to the various pins 
of the 555 timer, you can get this little gem to perform loads of different 
 functions — and it’s remarkably easy to do. You can find detailed, easy‐to‐
read information about its various applications on datasheets. I discuss three 
popular ways to configure a timing circuit using a 555 here.
