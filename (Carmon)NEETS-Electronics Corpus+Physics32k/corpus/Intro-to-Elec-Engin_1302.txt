The rectangular pulse train of Figure E14.1.4(a) consists of pulses of height A and duration D.
Such pulse trains are employed for timing purposes and to represent digital information. For a
particular pulse train, A = 3 and the duty cycle D/T = 1/3.
(a) Find the Fourier-series expansion of the pulse train.
(b) Sketch the line spectrum of the rectangular pulse train when T = 1 ms.
