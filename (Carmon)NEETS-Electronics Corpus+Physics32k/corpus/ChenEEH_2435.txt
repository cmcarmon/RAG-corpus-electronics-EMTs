Small Dipole Antenna
A small dipole antenna may be visualized as a small length of
current II ¼ ^zzIin, excited by connecting a pair of small metal
wires or rods to a radio frequency source. This is shown in
Figure 6.10. It is considered small when the length l is signiﬁ-
cantly smaller than the wavelength (l  l0) of operation. This
basic element is often used in many radio communication
systems as a whip antenna. For communication in a relatively
