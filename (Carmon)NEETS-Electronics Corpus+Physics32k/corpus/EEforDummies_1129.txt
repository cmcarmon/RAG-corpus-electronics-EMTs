The autoranging feature found on many digital multimeters makes it even 
easier to get a precise reading. For instance, when you want to measure volt-
age, you set the meter function to volts (either DC or AC) and take the meas-
urement. The meter automatically selects the range that produces the most 
precise reading. If you see an overrange indicator, that’s telling you the value 
is too high to be measured by the meter. Autoranging meters don’t require 
range settings, so their dials are a lot simpler.
