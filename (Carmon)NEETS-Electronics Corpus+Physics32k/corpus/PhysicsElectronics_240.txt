Our previous resonance circuit is an example of a two-terminal network. A source is present
but no load. A four-terminal network also has the source removed. The four-terminal
network can be described by a transfer function. A generic four-terminal network is shown
in Ô¨Ågure 2.17. Such a circuit can be analyzed simply by considering it as a voltage divider.
In general
