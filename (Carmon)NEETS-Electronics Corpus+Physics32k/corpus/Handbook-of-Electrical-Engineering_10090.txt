The training algorithm resembles methods used by Nguyen and Widrow [1990] and others for training a
neural controller to achieve an end goal. In this case, however, the output trajectory is of interest and the training
is  performed  in  realtime  (i.e.,  output  values  must  be  repeatedly  predicted  rather  than  observed  over  several
trials). A ï¬‚owchart of the control methodology is shown in Fig. 100.64.
