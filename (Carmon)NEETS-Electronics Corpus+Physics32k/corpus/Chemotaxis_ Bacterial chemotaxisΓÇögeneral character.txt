Some bacteria, such as E. coli, have several flagella per cell (4â€“10 typically). These can rotate in two ways:
Counter-clockwise rotation aligns the flagella into a single rotating bundle, causing the bacterium to swim in a straight line; and
Clockwise rotation breaks the flagella bundle apart such that each flagellum points in a different direction, causing the bacterium to tumble in place.
The directions of rotation are given for an observer outside the cell looking down the flagella toward the cell.
