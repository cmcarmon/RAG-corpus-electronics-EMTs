Karl Ferdinand Braun (1850–1918), of the University of Strasbourg,
invented  the  Braun  cathode-ray  tube  in  1879.  This  then  became  the
basis  for  the  picture  tube  used  for  so  many  years  for  televisions.  It  is
still the most economical device today, although the price of ﬂat-screen
systems is rapidly becoming competitive. Before the Braun tube could
be  used  in  television,  it  took  the  inventiveness  of  Vladimir K.
Zworykin (1889–1982) to develop the iconoscope so that the modern
television would become a reality. The iconoscope developed into the
orthicon and the image orthicon, which allowed images to be captured
and converted into signals that could be sent to the television receiver.
Thus, the television camera was born.
