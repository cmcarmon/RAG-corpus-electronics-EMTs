This chapter explains what semiconductors are, how 
to make them conduct current, and how to combine 
two semiconductors to create a diode. Then you 
get an eyewitness view of the valve‐like behavior 
of diodes — and take a look at how to exploit that 
behavior to accomplish amazing things in circuits.
