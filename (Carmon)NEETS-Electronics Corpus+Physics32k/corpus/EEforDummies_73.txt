If you can transport that energy to an object that allows work to be done on 
it, such as a light bulb, a motor, or a loudspeaker, you can put that energy to 
good use. The electrical energy carried by the electrons is absorbed by the 
object and transformed into another form of energy, such as light, heat, or 
motion. Thatâ€™s how you make the bulb glow, rotate the motor shaft, or cause 
the diaphragm of the speaker to vibrate and create sound.
