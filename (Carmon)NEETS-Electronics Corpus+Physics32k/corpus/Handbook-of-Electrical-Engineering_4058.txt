The design of the seams is a function of the type
of enclosure and the level and nature of the shielding
effectiveness  required.  For  small  instruments,  com-
puters, and similar equipment, the typical shielding
required  is  on  the  order  of  60  dB  for  electric  and
plane  wave  shielding.  EMI  gaskets  are  commonly
used to seal the openings in sheet metal construction.
In some high-performance applications the shielding
is  achieved  using  very  tight-ﬁtting  machined  hous-
ings. Examples are IF strips and large dynamic range
log  ampliﬁer  circuits.  Various  methods  of  sealing
joints are illustrated in Fig. 40.6. EMI gasketing methods are shown in Fig. 40.7. For large room-sized enclosures,
the  performance  requirements  typically  range  from  60  to  120  dB.  Conductive  EMI  shielding  tape  is  used  in
the 60-dB realm, clamped seams for 80–100 dB, and continuous welded seams for 120-dB performance. These
are illustrated in Fig. 40.8.
