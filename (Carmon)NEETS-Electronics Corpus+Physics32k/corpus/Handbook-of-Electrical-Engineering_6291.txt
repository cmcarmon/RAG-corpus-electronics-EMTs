The transmitter block diagram of Fig. 69.20 shows separate visual and aural PA stages. This conﬁguration
is  normally  used  for  high-power  transmitters.  Low-power  designs  often  use  a  combined  mode  (common
ampliﬁcation) in which the aural and visual signals are added prior to the PA. This approach offers a simpliﬁed
system but at the cost of additional precorrection of the input video signal.
