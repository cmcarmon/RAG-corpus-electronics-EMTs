As already mentioned, switches do not fail very often. However, there is a need for preventive
maintenance of switches. Periodically switches should be checked for corrosion at the terminals, smooth
and correct operation, and physical damage. Any problems found should be corrected immediately. Most
switches can be inspected visually for corrosion or damage. The operation of the switch may be checked
by moving the actuator. When the actuator is moved, you can feel whether the switch operation is smooth
or seems to have a great deal of friction. To check the actual switching, you can observe the operation of
the equipment or check the switch with a meter.
