A comparison of current television content rating systems, showing age on the horizontal axis. Note however that the specific criteria used in assigning a classification can vary widely from one country to another. Thus a color code or age range cannot be directly compared from one country to another.

Yellow  – Parental guidance is suggested for designated age range.
Purple  – Not recommended for a younger audience but not restricted.
Red  – Instructs that people under the age are not supposed to see it without parental supervision.
Black  – Instructs that people under the age are not supposed to see it, or restricted to a specific audience (content is usually locked by a password).
