real power in each phase (with its current coil in series with one phase of the load and its
potential coil across the phase of the load), the total real power in a three-phase system can
be determined by the sum of the wattmeter readings. However, in practice, this may not be
possible due to the nonaccessibility of either the neutral of the wye connection, or the individual
phases of the delta connection. Hence it is more desirable to have a method for measuring
the total real power drawn by a three-phase load while we have access to only three line
terminals.
