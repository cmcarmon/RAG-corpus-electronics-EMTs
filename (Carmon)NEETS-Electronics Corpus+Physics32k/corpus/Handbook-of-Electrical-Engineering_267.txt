Kirchhoff â€™s voltage law can be used to completely analyze a circuit, but it is seldom used in large-scale circuit
simulation  programs.  The  basic  reason  is  that  the  currents  that  correspond  to  a  loop  of  a  circuit  do  not
necessarily correspond to the currents in the individual branches of the circuit. Nonetheless, KVL is frequently
used to troubleshoot a circuit by measuring voltage drops across selected components.
