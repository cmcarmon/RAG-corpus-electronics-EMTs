This  section  presents  an  overview  of  a  variety  of  communication  systems  that  have  been  developed  to
overcome the constraints of physical communication channels by exploiting the capabilities of the electronic
and optoelectronic devices that are described elsewhere in this handbook. As a reﬂection of the dual inﬂuences
of  electrotechnology  and  user  applications,  some  of  the  following  chapters  have  application  themes  (broad-
casting, satellite and aerospace, personal and ofﬁce, and telemetry), while the rest have themes related to systems
techniques (digital, optical, network, information theory, phase-locked loop, and computer-aided design).
