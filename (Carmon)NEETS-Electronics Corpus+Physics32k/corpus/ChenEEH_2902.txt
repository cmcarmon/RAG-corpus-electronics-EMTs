The expressions of CA, I, G, and SCV depend on the target
spectrum, the clutter spectrum, and the types of canceller
Ô¨Ålters. Assume that the clutter spectrum is normally distrib-
uted around zero Doppler with a variance of s2
v, and assume
that the Doppler spectrum is uniformly distributed between
0 and 1/T. For a single canceller, we then have:
