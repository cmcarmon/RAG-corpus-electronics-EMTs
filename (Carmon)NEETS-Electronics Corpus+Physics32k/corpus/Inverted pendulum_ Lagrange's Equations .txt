The equations of motion can be derived using Lagrange's equations. We refer to the drawing to the right where



θ
(
t
)


{\displaystyle \theta (t)}
is the angle of the pendulum of length



l


{\displaystyle l}
with respect to the vertical direction and the acting forces are gravity and an external force F in the x-direction. Define



x
(
t
)


{\displaystyle x(t)}
to be the position of the cart. The Lagrangian



L

{\displaystyle L=T-V}
of the system is:

{\displaystyle L={\frac {1}{2}}Mv_{1}^{2}+{\frac {1}{2}}mv_{2}^{2}-mg\ell \cos \theta }

where




v

{\displaystyle v_{1}}
is the velocity of the cart and




v

{\displaystyle v_{2}}
is the velocity of the point mass



m


{\displaystyle m}
.




v

{\displaystyle v_{1}}
and




v

{\displaystyle v_{2}}
can be expressed in terms of x and



θ


{\displaystyle \theta }
by writing the velocity as the first derivative of the position;
