Fiber  AM-VSB  trunk  systems  can  replace  the  long  coaxial  trunks  so  that  head-end  quality  video  can  be
delivered deep within the distribution network [Chiddix et al., 1990]. Inexpensive coaxial cable extends from
the optical receivers at the ends of the ﬁber trunks to each home. Architectures in which the number of electronic
ampliﬁers  between  each  receiver  and  any  home  is  approximately  three  or  fewer  offer  a  good  compromise
between cost and performance. The short spans of coaxial cable support bandwidths approaching 1 GHz, two
