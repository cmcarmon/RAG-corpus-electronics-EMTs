The homogeneous solution vCH(t) to Equation 12.119 is obtained by solv-
ing this differential equation with vIN ≡ 0. With vIN ≡ 0, the circuit shown in
Figure 12.26 is identical to that shown in Figure 12.15, and so the two circuits
have the same homogeneous equation. Thus, borrowing the homogeneous
solution from Equation 12.48, we can write
