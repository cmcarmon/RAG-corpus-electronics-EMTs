• Ampliﬁcation to compensate for attenuation
• Filtering to reduce interference and noise, and/or to obtain selected facets of information
• Equalization to correct some types of distortion
• Frequency translation or sampling to get a signal that better suits the system characteristics
• Multiplexing to permit one transmission system to handle two or more information-bearing
