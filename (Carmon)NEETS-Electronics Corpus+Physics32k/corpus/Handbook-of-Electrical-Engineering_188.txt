HRC-L or Class L fuses are unique in dimension but may be considered as an extension of the HRCI-J fuses
for ampere ratings above 600 A. They are rated at 600 V with ampere ratings from 601 to 6000 A. They are
physically larger and are constructed with bolt-on-type blade contacts. These fuses are generally used in low-
voltage distribution systems where supply transformers are capable of delivering more than 600 A.
