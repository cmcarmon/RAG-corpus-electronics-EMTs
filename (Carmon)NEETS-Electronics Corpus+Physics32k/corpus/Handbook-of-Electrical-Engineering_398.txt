The k-Tree Approach
The development of the analysis of passive electrical networks
using topological concepts may be dated back to 1847 when
Kirchhoff formulated his set of topological formulas in terms
of resistances and the branch-current system of equations. In
1892, Maxwell developed another set of topological formulas
based  on  the  k-tree  concept,  which  are  the  duals  of  Kirch-
hoff ’s. These two sets of formulas were supported mainly by
heuristic reasoning and no formal proofs were then available.
In the following we shall discuss only Maxwell’s topological
