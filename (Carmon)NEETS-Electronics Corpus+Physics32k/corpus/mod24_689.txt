For high-frequency applications, analog fiber optic transmitters use laser diodes as sources. Typical
high frequency applications are cable television trunk line and raw radar remoting applications. The LDs
typically operate in either the 1300-nm or 1550-nm windows. 1550-nm transmitters are typically used in
cable television trunk line applications. Other applications may use either 1300-nm or 1550-nm LDs.
High frequency transmitters are predominately circuit cards, but some hybrid microcircuit modules are
also used. All high frequency analog transmitters contain TE coolers as well as linearization and power
control circuitry.
