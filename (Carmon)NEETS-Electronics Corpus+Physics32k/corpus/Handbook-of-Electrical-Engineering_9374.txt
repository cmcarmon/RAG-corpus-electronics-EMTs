General Purpose Libraries and Packages
Traditionally, graphical software systems are developed as a result of programming in high-level languages with
interfaces  to  standard  or  quasi-standard  software  packages.  These  packages  attempt  to  address  the  issues  of
device independence and application program portability by allowing systems to drive a wide variety of display
devices as well as isolating the programmer from machine-speciÔ¨Åc graphics commands. Portability of programs
is enhanced by allowing the user to move an application from one system to another. The primary programming
languages include C, Fortran, and Pascal.
