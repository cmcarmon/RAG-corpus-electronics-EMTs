The  power  radiated  from  a  satellite  is  described  as  its  effective  radiated  isotopic  power  (EIRP)  and  is  the
radiated power of the satellite in decibels referenced to one watt of power. The units are in dBW. The strength
of the signal received on the ground is a function of the spacecraft location and that of the ground station and
will vary depending upon location. A map of the signal strength contours is called the satellite’s “footprint.”
