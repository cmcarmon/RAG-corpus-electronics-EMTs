A strictly enhancement MOSFET results from the conﬁguration shown in ﬁgure 5.19b.
Below some threshold of positive gate-source voltage, the connecting channel of N-type ma-
terial between the drain and source is completely blocked by the depletion region generated
by the PN junction. As the gate-source voltage is made more positive, the minority positive
carriers are repelled back into the P-type material, leaving free negative charges behind. The
eﬀect is to shrink the depletion region and increase the conductivity between the drain and
source.
