A	plus	side	to	the	knowledge	of	how	a	circuit	operates	is	that	you	can	choose	any
from	your	pack	of	electronic	devices	and	have	it	upgraded	according	to	preference;
the	possibilities	of	its	new	functions	are	endless.	You	won’t	even	have	to	spend	a
grand	amount,	so	long	as	you’re	familiar	with	the	functions	of	particular
installments.	The	result	of	hacking	the	original	system	may	be	rather	bizarre,	since
the	product	is	no	longer	the	same,	but	nonetheless,	the	result	is	likely	the	way	you
desired.
In	the	sample	project	below,	the	goal	is	hack	a	charger;	particularly,	modify	an
existing	charger	and	have	it	operate	with	a	battery.	It	can	be	connected	to	any
electronic	device	with	a	USB	port.	This	is	useful	during	emergencies	when	an
electric	outlet	is	nowhere	to	be	found.
