to be psychovisually redundant. Human perception of the
visual information does not involve the quantitative an-
alysis of every pixel; rather, the eye searches for some
recognizable groupings to be interpreted as distinguished
features in the image. This is the reason that the direct
current (dc) component of a small section of the image,
which indicates the average luminosity level of that par-
ticular section of the image, contains more visually im-
portant information than a high frequency alternating
current (ac) component, which has the information
regarding the difference between luminosity levels of
some successive pixels. Psychovisual redundancy can be
eliminated by throwing away some of the redundant
information. Since the elimination of psychovisually re-
dundant data results in a loss of quantitative information
and is an irreversible process, it results in lossy data
compression. How coarse or how ﬁne to quantize the
data depends on what quality and/or what compression
ratio is required at the output. This stage acts as the
tuning tap in the whole image compression model. On
the same grounds, the human eye’s response to color
information is not as sharp as it is for the luminosity
information. More color information is psychovisually
redundant than the gray scale information simply because
the eye cannot perceive ﬁner details of colors, whereas it
can for gray scale values.
