Finally, it is important to recognize that current sources can be used to
construct circuits in which KCL is violated. Several examples of circuits con-
structed from current sources in which KCL is violated at every node are shown
in Figure 2.13. We will not be concerned with such circuits here for two reasons.
First, if KCL does not hold at a node, then electric charge must accumulate at
that node. This is inconsistent with the constraint of the lumped matter disci-
pline that dq/dt be zero. Second, if a circuit were actually built to violate KCL,
something would ultimately give. For example, the current sources might cease
