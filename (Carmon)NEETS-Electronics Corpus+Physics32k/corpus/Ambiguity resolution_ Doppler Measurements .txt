Doppler systems involve velocity measurements similar to the kind of measurements made using a strobe light.
For example, a strobe light can be used as a tachometer to measure rotational velocity for rotating machinery. Strobe light measurements can be inaccurate because the light may be flashing 2 or 3 times faster than shaft rotation speed. The user can only produce an accurate measurement by increasing the pulse rate starting near zero until pulses are fast enough to make the rotating object appear stationary.
Radar and sonar systems use the same phenomenon to detect target speed.
