At this point, we can also look at the impedance of each component (ZL
and ZR) in Figure 13.11 and develop the same qualitative intuition about the
behavior of the circuit from the voltage-divider relationship. For instance, when
Ï‰1 is small, the impedance of the inductor is small, and so Vo = Vi. Similarly,
for high frequencies, the impedance of the inductor becomes much greater than
that of the resistor and so Vo becomes very small.
