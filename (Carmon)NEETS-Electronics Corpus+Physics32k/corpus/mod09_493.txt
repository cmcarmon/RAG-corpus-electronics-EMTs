An increase in gate length results in an increase in the number of time constants and an increase in 
the percentage of charge that the capacitor will take on during this time interval. As stated earlier, if the 
number of time constants were to exceed 0.1, linearity would decrease. The reason for a decrease in 
linearity is that a greater percentage of VCC is used. The Universal Time Constant Chart (figure 3-39) 
shows that the charge line begins to curve. A decrease in gate length has the opposite effect on linearity in 
that it causes linearity to increase. The reason for this increase is that a smaller number of time constants 
are used and, in turn, a smaller percentage of the applied VCC is used.
