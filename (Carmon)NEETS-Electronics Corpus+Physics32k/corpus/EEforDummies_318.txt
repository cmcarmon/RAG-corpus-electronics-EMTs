That relationship is summed up nicely in a simple equation with an authori-
tative name: Ohm’s Law. In this chapter, you put Ohm’s Law to work to find 
out what’s going on in some basic circuits. Then you get a look at the role of 
Ohm’s Law and related power calculations in the design of electronic  circuits.
