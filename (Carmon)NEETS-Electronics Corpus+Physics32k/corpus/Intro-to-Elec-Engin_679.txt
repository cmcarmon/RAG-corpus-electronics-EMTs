iD = K
2(vGS − VT )vDS − v2
(7.4.6)
T having the unit of A/V2, and IDSS is the value of iD when
where K is a constant given by IDSS /V 2
vGS = 2VT . The boundary between ohmic and active regions occurs when vDS = vGS − VT . For
vGS > VT and vDS ≥ vGS − VT , in the active region, the drain current is ideally constant and
given by
