these devices, the insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) is
the most popular and widely used device. A vertical cross-
section of the IGBT is shown in Figure 7.16(A). The structure
is similar to a vertical diffused MOSFET. The main difference
is the p√æ layer at the back of the device that forms the collector
of the device. This layer forms a pn junction, which injects
minority carriers into the drift region under normal conduc-
tion. The structure at the top of the device is identical to a
MOSFET in all respects including processing and cell geom-
etry.
