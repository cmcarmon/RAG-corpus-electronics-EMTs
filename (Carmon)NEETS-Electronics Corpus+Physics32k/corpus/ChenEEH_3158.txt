All of these stresses could be acting on the insulators in
various combinations. Hence, it is clear that the insulators
have to perform under a wide range of service conditions.
Needless to say, only insulators that are designed while suitably
considering all these stresses will work satisfactorily in the Ô¨Åeld
for many years.
