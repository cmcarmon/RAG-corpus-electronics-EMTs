Resistors and batteries are two of our most familiar lumped elements. Such
lumped elements are the primitive building blocks of electronic circuits.
Electronic access to an element is made through its terminals. At times, ter-
minals are paired together in a natural way to form ports. These ports offer an
alternative view of how electronic access is made to an element. An example of
an arbitrary element with two terminals and one port is shown in Figure 1.8.
Other elements may have three or more terminals, and two or more ports.
