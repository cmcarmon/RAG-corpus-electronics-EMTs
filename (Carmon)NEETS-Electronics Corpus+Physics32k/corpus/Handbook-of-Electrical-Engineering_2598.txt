Subthreshold Characteristics
Quite different current-voltage behavior is seen in subthreshold, that is, for gate biases so low that the channel
is in weak inversion. In this case the number of carriers in the channel is so small that their charge does not
affect the potential, and channel carriers simply must adapt to the potential set up by the electrodes and the
dopant ions. Likewise, in subthreshold any ï¬‚ow of current is so small that it causes no potential drop along
the interface, which becomes an equipotential.
