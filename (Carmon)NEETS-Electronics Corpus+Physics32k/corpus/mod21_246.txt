You must periodically check dry cell batteries that are used for test instruments and portable or field
equipments for loss of power. For actual voltages of dry batteries, you should measure with a battery
tester for a minimum acceptable voltage before installation. The TS-183/U series of battery testers
incorporate a multiple-range voltmeter, battery-loading resistors, multiplier resistors, and a jack-switching
arrangement that connects the load resistors across the voltmeter for a total of 32 different voltmeter-load
resistor combinations. This type of tester permits you to complete a rapid and accurate measurement of
battery potentials under load conditions, ranging in voltages from 1.5 to 180 volts. A data chart supplied
with the battery tester provides information regarding the jack to be used and minimum acceptable
voltages of various batteries used in Navy equipments.
