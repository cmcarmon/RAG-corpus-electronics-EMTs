The advantages of the sample average approach are that it is conceptually simple and it does not require a
priori assumptions about the form of the pdf’s of the signal and noise. Hence, it is a nonparametric estimation
approach.  This  approach,  however,  has  three  major  disadvantages.  First,  the  estimator  does  not  utilize  any
speech speciﬁc information such as the periodicity of the signal and the signal’s AR model. Second, the training
