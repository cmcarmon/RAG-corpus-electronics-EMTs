Popularly harmonizing the theory of general relativity that describes gravitation, and applications to large-scale structures like stars, planets, and galaxies with quantum mechanics, that describes the other three fundamental forces acting on the atomic scale, quantum mechanics and general relativity can seem fundamentally incompatible. Also, demonstrations of the structure of general relativity essentially follows inevitably from the quantum mechanics of interacting theoretical spin-2 massless particles called gravitons.
No concrete proof of gravitons exist, but quantized theories of matter may necessitate their existence. The observation that all fundamental forces except gravity have one or more known messenger particles leads researchers to believe that at least one must exist. This hypothetical particle is known as the graviton. The predicted find would result in the classification of the graviton as a force particle similar to the photon of the electromagnetic interaction. Many of the accepted notions of a unified theory of physics since the 1970s assume, and to some degree depend upon, the existence of the graviton. These include string theory, superstring theory, M-theory, and loop quantum gravity. Detection of gravitons will validate these various lines of research to unify quantum mechanics and relativity theory.
The Weinbergâ€“Witten theorem places some constraints on theories in which the graviton is a composite particle.
