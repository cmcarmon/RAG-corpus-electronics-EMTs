In multimode fibers, waveguide dispersion and material dispersion are basically separate properties.
Multimode waveguide dispersion is generally small compared to material dispersion. Waveguide
dispersion is usually neglected. However, in single mode fibers, material and waveguide dispersion are
interrelated. The total dispersion present in single mode fibers may be minimized by trading material and
waveguide properties depending on the wavelength of operation.
