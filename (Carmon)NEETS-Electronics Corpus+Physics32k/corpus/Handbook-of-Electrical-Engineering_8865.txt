The  requirement  that  the  cache  memory  be  associative  (content-addressable)  complicates  the  design.
Addressing data by content is inherently more complicated than by its address. All the tags must be compared
concurrently, of course, because the whole point of the cache is to achieve low latency. The cache can be made
simpler, however, by introducing a mapping of memory locations to cache cells. This mapping limits the number
, in which
of possible cells in which a particular line may reside. The extreme case is known as 
each memory location is mapped to a single location in the cache. Direct mapping makes many aspects of the
design simpler, since there is no choice of where the line might reside, and no choice as to which line must be
replaced. However, direct mapping can result in poor utilization of the cache when two memory locations are
alternately accessed and must share a single cache cell.
