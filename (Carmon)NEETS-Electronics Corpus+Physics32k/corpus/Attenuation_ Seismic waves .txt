The energy with which an earthquake affects a location depends on the running distance. The attenuation in the signal of ground motion intensity plays an important role in the assessment of possible strong groundshaking. A seismic wave loses energy as it propagates through the earth (attenuation). This phenomenon is tied into the dispersion of the seismic energy with the distance. There are two types of dissipated energy:
geometric dispersion caused by distribution of the seismic energy to greater volumes
dispersion as heat, also called intrinsic attenuation or anelastic attenuation.
