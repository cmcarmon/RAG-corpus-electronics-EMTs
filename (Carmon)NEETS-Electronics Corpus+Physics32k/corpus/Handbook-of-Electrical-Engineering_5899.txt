Assume that an external torque is applied to the shaft so that the rotor rotates at a certain speed. The rotor
winding formed by the two conductors experiences a periodically varying magnetic ﬁeld, and hence an emf is
induced  across  the  winding.  Note  that  this  voltage  periodically  alternates  in  sign,  and  thus,  the  situation  is
conceptually the same as the one encountered in ac generators. To make the machine act as a dc source, viewed
from the terminals, some form of rectiﬁcation needs be introduced. This function is made possible with the
use of copper segments and brushes.
