The technology used in making the memory inte-
grated circuits (chips) is based on either bipolar (also 
referred to as transistor-to-transistor logic [TTL]) or 
metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS) transistors. Bi-
polar memory is faster than MOS memory, but MOS 
memory can be packed with a higher density, provid-
ing more memory locations in the same amount of 
area required by bipolar memory.
