With the capacitor now charged, assume that the current source is suddenly set
to zero as suggested in Figure 10.5a, where for convenience, the time axis is
redefined so that the turn-off occurs at t = 0. The relevant circuit to analyze the
RC turn-off or discharge transient now contains just a resistor and a capacitor
as indicated in Figure 10.5c. The voltage on the capacitor at the start of the
experiment is represented by the initial condition
