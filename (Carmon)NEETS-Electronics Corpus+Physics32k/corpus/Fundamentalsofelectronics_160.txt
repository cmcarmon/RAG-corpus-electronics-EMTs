Exercise 3.8
(Solution on p. 94.)
Contrast a series combination of resistors with a parallel one. Which variable (voltage or current)
is the same for each and which diï¬€ers? What are the equivalent resistances? When resistors are
placed in series, is the equivalent resistance bigger, in between, or smaller than the component
resistances? What is this relationship for a parallel combination?
