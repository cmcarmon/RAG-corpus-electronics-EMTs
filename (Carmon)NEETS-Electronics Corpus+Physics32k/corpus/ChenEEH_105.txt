The physical relationship between the current and voltage
variables of network elements is speciﬁed by Ohm’s law. For
voltage and current sources, the voltage and current variables
are required to have speciﬁed values. The linear dependence
among the voltage variables in the network and the linear
dependence among the current variables are governed by
Kirchhoff ’s voltage and current laws:
