Time redundancy methods attempt to reduce the amount of extra hardware at the expense of using additional
time.  In  many  applications,  the  time  is  of  much  less  importance  than  the  hardware  because  hardware  is  a
physical entity that impacts weight, size, power consumption, and cost. Time, on the other hand, may be readily
available in some applications. The basic concept of time redundancy is the repetition of computations in ways
that allow faults to be detected. Time redundancy can function in a system in several ways. The fundamental
concept  is  to  perform  the  same  computation  two  or  more  times  and  compare  the  results  to  determine  if  a
discrepancy exists. If an error is detected, the computations can be performed again to see if the disagreement
remains or disappears. Such approaches are often good for detecting errors resulting from transient faults but
cannot provide protection against errors resulting from permanent faults.
