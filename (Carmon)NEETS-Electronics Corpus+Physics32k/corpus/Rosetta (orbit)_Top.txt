A Rosetta orbit is a complex type of orbit. Theoretically, an object approaching a black hole with an intermediate velocity (not slow enough to spiral into the hole and not fast enough to escape) will enter a complex orbit pattern, bounded by a near and far distance to the hole and tracing an oscillating pattern known as a hypotrochoid.
In quantum mechanics, the Rosetta orbit is a solution for spherically symmetric (except 1/r) potentials.
