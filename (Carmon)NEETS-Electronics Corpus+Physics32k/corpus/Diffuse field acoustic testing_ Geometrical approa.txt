Many theoretical ways to model sound propagation are used. One of these is the geometrical approach. This represents sound waves as a ray of energy propagating. When it meets an obstacle, this ray has two possible behaviors: It can be reflected following the normal of the plan, specular reflection. Alternatively it can be separated into many rays following a mathematical law (for example Lambert's law), diffused reflection.
