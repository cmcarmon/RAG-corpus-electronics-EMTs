The use of nonlinear devices (BJT and FET) in constructing linear ampliﬁers has been studied in
Chapter 8. Although these devices are inherently nonlinear, their operation was conﬁned to the
linear portions of their characteristics in order to produce linear ampliﬁcation of a signal. When
these devices are operated in the nonlinear regions of their characteristics, the primary use lies in
electronic switches for use in computers and other digital systems. Digital electronic circuits are
becoming of increasing importance. Revolutionary advances in integrated-circuit (IC) technology
have made it possible to place a large number of switches (gates) on a chip of very small size.
Besides the advantage of utilizing less space, another signiﬁcant advantage of digital systems
over analog systems is their inherent immunity to noise and interference.
