The Diendorferâ€“Uman model described above assumes that the return stroke propagates up the lightning
channel at a constant speed and that the current from activated sections of the channel travels to ground at
the speed of light. An analytical generalization of the DU model which allows for the return stroke speed and
the downward current speed to be arbitrary functions of height has been presented by Thottappillil et al.[1991].
