The linear Gaussian-noise channel is a widely used model for space communication (in the power limited
region) and for the telephone channel (in the bandwidth limited region). Thanks to the prevalence of digital
switching and digital transmission in modern telephone systems, not only signal-to-noise ratios have improved
over time but the Gaussian-noise model in Example 5 becomes increasingly questionable because quantization
is  responsible  for  a  major  component  of  the  channel  distortion.  Therefore,  future  improvements  in  modem
speeds are expected to arise mainly from Ô¨Åner modeling of the channel.
