it is apparent that the device must
provide negative resistance. For single-frequency operation, it
is necessary to design the circuit so that the previous condition
is met at only one frequency. Also note that because the
impedance of the negative resistance device is affected by its
operating mode, oscillation almost invariably undergoes some
frequency shift. Moreover, conditions are (11.24) and (11.25)
necessary for oscillation but do not guarantee stable steady-
state oscillation. It can be shown that stable oscillation will
occur if the following is satisÔ¨Åed:
