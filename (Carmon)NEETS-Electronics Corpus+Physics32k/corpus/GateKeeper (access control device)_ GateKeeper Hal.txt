In December 2017 Untethered Labs announced on Kickstarter that they would release the Halberd, a key fob with a new hardware design. According to the company, the Halberd's larger design, new processor, and added accelerometer improve the device's performance and battery life. The Halberd subsequently reached its funding goal of $25,000 by raising $50,000 in 28 days from over 400 backers and is expected to be released in January 2018. The company also plans to release compatible software for Mac and Linux systems as well as single sign-on capabilities in 2018.
