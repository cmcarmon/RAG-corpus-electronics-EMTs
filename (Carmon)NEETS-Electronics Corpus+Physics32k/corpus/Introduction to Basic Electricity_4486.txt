Notice that the Q output of the first stage is cou-
pled to the clock input of the second stage. The second 
stage only changes state when triggered by the transi-
tion of the output of the first stage. Because of the de-
lay through the flip-flop, the second flip-flop does not 
change state at the same time the clock pulse is applied. 
Therefore, the two flip-flops are never simultaneously 
triggered, which results in asynchronous operation.
