Consider a material element of unit initial volume, starting from an initial state under initial Cauchy (or true) stress





σ


0




{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}_{0}}
and let




σ



{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}}
be the Cauchy stress in the final configuration. Let



W


{\displaystyle W}
be the work done (per unit initial volume) by the internal forces during an incremental deformation from this initial state. Then the variation



δ
W


{\displaystyle \delta W}
corresponds to the variation in the work done due to a variation in the displacement



δ

u



{\displaystyle \delta \mathbf {u} }
. The displacement variation has to satisfy the displacement boundary conditions.
Let





S


(
m
)




{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {S}}_{(m)}}
be an objective stress tensor in the initial configuration. Define the stress increment with respect to the initial configuration is




S

=


S


(
m
)


−


σ


0




{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {S}}={\boldsymbol {S}}_{(m)}-{\boldsymbol {\sigma }}_{0}}
. Alternatively, if




P



{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {P}}}
is the unsymmetric first Piola–Kirchhoff stress referred to the initial configuration, the increment in stress can be expressed as




T

=

σ

{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {T}}={\boldsymbol {P}}-{\boldsymbol {\sigma }}_{0}}
.
