Statements in the architectural body of a design entity may
consist of, as already detailed, both concurrent and simultan-
eous statements. This is of special interest to a modeler because
it supports a consistent description of design objects operating
in mixed-mode without an artiﬁcial separation into event-
discrete and time-continuous parts. Mixing up event-oriented
and time-continuous behavior in many cases results in dealing
with model discontinuities. This problem is addressed by the
‘‘break’’ statement used for both initialization and for discon-
tinuity handling. A simple example for a 1-bit D/A converter
given in Figure 3.9 illustrates its usage.
