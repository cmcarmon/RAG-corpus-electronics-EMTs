The locations of all controls, connectors, and indicators are shown in figure 4-8. The INPUT
terminals, located on the left-hand side of the meter face, provide input connections for voltage or
resistance (V-?) and milliampere current (MA) measurements with respect to the common terminal. The
readout section, located across the upper half of the meter face, contains light-emitting diode (LED)
indicators. They display the measured input and polarity signs for dc measurements. The POWER switch,
located on the lower right-hand side of the meter face, is a push-button switch used to energize the
instrument. The RANGE switches, located on the lower, middle, right-hand portion of the meter face,
select the voltage (200 millivolts, 2, 20, 200, or 1,200 volts), current (200 microamperes, 2, 200, or 2,000
milliamperes), and resistance (200 ohms, 2, 20, 200, or 2,000 kilohms) ranges. The FUNCTION switches,
located on the lower, middle, left-hand portion of the meter face, select the voltage, current, or resistance
modes. The MA input terminal is also a fuse holder for the current protection fuse.
