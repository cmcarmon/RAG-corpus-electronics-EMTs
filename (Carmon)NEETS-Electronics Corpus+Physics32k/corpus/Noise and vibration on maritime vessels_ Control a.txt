To control the mechanical vibrations at the origin, isolating fittings, elastic mounting of engines, elastic holding of pipes or dampers can be installed. These will absorb a part of the vibrations (and the noise) produced by the machines. To control the electromagnetic vibrations at the origin, skewing the electric motor or choosing a better slot/pole combination will reduce electromagnetic force harmonics or avoid resonances between magnetic forces and structural modes of the electric motor.
