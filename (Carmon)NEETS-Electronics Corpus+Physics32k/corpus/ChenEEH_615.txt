Although a detailed comparison of performance of these
systems to their counterparts is not offered here, one must
keep in mind that such comparisons are only meaningful
when the systems under question cover the same dynamic
range and present the same precision of operations. This
necessity usually translates in certain data word lengths,
which, in their turn, affect the operating characteristics of the
systems.
