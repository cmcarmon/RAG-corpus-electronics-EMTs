Building Light Chaser 2
Figure 17-9 shows another way to build a light chaser. The left side of Light 
Chaser 2 is the same as the left side of Light Chaser 1, so the brains of both 
circuits operate in the same way. The right side of Light Chaser 2 is set up 
so that the LEDs light up sequentially from LED1 through LED6 and then 
back down to LED1. The lighting sequence follows this repeating pattern: 
1‐2‐3‐4‐5‐6‐5‐4‐3‐2. By adjusting the pot (R1), you can change the speed of this 
bidirectional lighting sequence.
