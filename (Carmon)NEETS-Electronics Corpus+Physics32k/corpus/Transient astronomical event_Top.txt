A transient astronomical event, often shortened by astronomers to a transient, is an astronomical object or phenomenon whose duration may be from seconds to days, weeks, or even several years. This is in contrast to the timescale of the millions or billions of years during which the galaxies and their component stars in our universe have evolved. Singularly, the term is used for violent deep sky events such as supernovae, hypernovae, quark-nova, gamma ray bursts, transits, eclipses, gravitational microlensing, and tidal disruption events, etc. These events are part of the broader topic of time domain astronomy.
