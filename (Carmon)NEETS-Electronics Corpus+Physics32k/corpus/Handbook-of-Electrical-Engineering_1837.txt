where l is the smallest wavelength component in the signal received by the array of sensors, then the grating
lobes have no effect on the received signal. A plane wave of unit amplitude which is incident upon the array
at bearing angle u degrees, as shown in Fig. 17.23, produces outputs at the sensors given by the vector
