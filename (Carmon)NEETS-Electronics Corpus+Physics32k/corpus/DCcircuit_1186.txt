the fuse wire as short as is practically possible. Just as a normal wireâ€™s ampacity is not related
to its length (10-gauge solid copper wire will handle 40 amps of current in free air, regardless
of how long or short of a piece it is), a fuse wire of certain material and gauge will blow at
a certain current no matter how long it is. Since length is not a factor in current rating, the
shorter it can be made, the less resistance it will have end-to-end.
