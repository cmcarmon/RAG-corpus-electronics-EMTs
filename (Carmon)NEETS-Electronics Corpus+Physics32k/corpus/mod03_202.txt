Parallax can be a problem when you are reading a meter. Since the pointer is slightly above the scale
(to allow the pointer to move freely), you must look straight at the pointer to have a correct meter reading.
In other words, you must be in line with the pointer and the scale. Figure 1-41 shows the effect of parallax
error.
