CQMOM has the ability to model a fully 3D velocity PDF, known as a polykinetic approach where



f
(


v


)


{\displaystyle f({\mathbf {v} })}
is not assumed to be a single Delta function. The method is computationally expensive, but very cost-effective when collisions are considered or in dense particle regimes,



K
n
≈
O
(

)


{\displaystyle Kn\approx O(1)}
, which cannot be modeled using N-S and where DPS is computationally restrictive. CQMOM is also applicable for a dispersed phase where



S

{\displaystyle St>1}
.
