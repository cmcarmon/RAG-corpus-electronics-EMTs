where P–jQ is the load complex power and E is the voltage at the bus where a distance relay is connected. This
impedance maps into the RX plane, as do all other apparent impedances, and hence the question arises whether
this apparent load impedance could be mistaken for a fault by the distance relay. Clearly, this depends upon
the shape of the distance relay characteristic employed. The loadability of a distance relay refers to the maximum
load power (minimum apparent impedance) that the line can carry before a protective zone of a distance relay
is penetrated by the apparent impedance. A typical load line is shown in Fig. 61.45. It is clear from this ﬁgure
that the mho characteristic has a higher loadability than the directional impedance relay. In fact, other relay
characteristics can be designed so that the loadability of a relay is increased even further.
