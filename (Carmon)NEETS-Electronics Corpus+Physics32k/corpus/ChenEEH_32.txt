Special case 1
When one of the elements in a loop is a current source, the
voltage across it cannot be written using the vâ€“i relation of the
element. In this case, the voltage across the current source
should be treated as an unknown variable to be determined.
If a current source is present in only one loop and is not
common to more than one loop, then the current of the loop
in which the current source is present should be equal to the
value of the current source and hence is known. To determine
the remaining currents, there is no need to write the KVL
equation for the current source loop. However, to determine
the voltage of the current source, a KVL equation for the
current source loop needs to be written. This equation is
presented in example 1.3.
