If you short out a power supply, you send 
large amounts of electrical energy from 
one side of the power supply to the other. 
With nothing in the circuit to limit the current and absorb the electrical 
energy, heat builds up quickly in the wire and in the power supply. A short 
circuit can melt the insulation around a wire and may cause a fire, an explo-
sion, or a release of harmful chemicals from certain power supplies, such as 
a rechargeable battery or a car battery.
