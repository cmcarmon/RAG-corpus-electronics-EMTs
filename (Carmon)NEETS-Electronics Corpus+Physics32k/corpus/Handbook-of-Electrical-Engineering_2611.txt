Equation (24.33) expresses the net minority-carrier density/unit area as the product of the bulk minority-
2/NB, with the depth of the minority-carrier distribution dINV multiplied in turn
carrier density/unit volume, ni
by the customary Boltzmann factor exp[q(fS â€“ VS)/kT ] expressing the enhancement of the interface density
over the bulk due to lower energy at the interface. The depth dINV is related to the carrier distribution near the
interface using the approximation (valid in weak inversion) that the minority-carrier density decays exponen-
tially with distance from the oxide-silicon surface. In this approximation, dINV is the centroid of the minority-
carrier  density.  For  example,  for  a  uniform  bulk  doping  of  1016  dopant  ions/cm3  at  290 K,  using  Eq. (24.33)
and  the  surface  potential  at  threshold  from  Eq. (24.38)  below  (fTH  =  0.69 V),  there  are  QD /q  =
321011 charges/cm2 in the depletion layer at threshold. This QD corresponds to a dINV = 5.4 nm and a carrier
density at threshold of Ninv = 5.42109 charges/cm2.
