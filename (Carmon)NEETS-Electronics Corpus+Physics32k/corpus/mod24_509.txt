Other test methods are available for measuring other multimode and single mode fiber core
parameters. Additional test methods exist for measuring multimode fiber core diameter and NA. For
single mode fibers, the mode field diameter measurement replaces core diameter and NA measurements.
Core diameter, numerical aperture, and mode field diameter measurements are identified and explained
later in this chapter.
