The process of fusion splicing involves using localized heat to melt or fuse the ends of two optical
fibers together. The splicing process begins by preparing each fiber end for fusion. Fusion splicing
requires that all protective coatings be removed from the ends of each fiber. The fiber is then cleaved
using the score-and-break method. The quality of each fiber end is inspected using a microscope. In
fusion splicing, splice loss is a direct function of the angles and quality of the two fiber-end faces.
