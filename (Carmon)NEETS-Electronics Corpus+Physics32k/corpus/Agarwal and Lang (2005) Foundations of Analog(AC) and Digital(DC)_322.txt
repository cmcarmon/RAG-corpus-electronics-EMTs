Finally, the two voltage-divider examples illustrate an important point, namely that series
elements all carry the same branch current because the terminals from these elements
are connected end-to-end without connection to additional branches through which the
current can divert. This results in the KCL seen in Equations 2.42, 2.43, and 2.62, which
state the equivalence of the branch currents.
