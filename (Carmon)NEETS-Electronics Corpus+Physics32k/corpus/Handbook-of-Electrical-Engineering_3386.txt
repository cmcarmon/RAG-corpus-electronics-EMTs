Perhaps the most promising near-term application of integrated optic devices in the ﬁeld of rotation sensing
is as a key component in optical ﬁber gyroscopes. A typical ﬁber optic gyro component is shown in Fig. 31.28.
The device consists of a polarizer, a Y-junction, and two phase modulators, all integrated on a single substrate.
In ﬁber gyro systems, the integrated optic component replaces individual, ﬁber-based components that perform
the  same  function.  The  integrated  optic  component  offers  a  greatly  improved  performance,  at  a  signiﬁcant
reduction  in  cost,  compared  to  the  ﬁber-based  components.  Most  ﬁber  optic  gyro  development  teams  have
done away with the ﬁber components and have adopted LiNbO3-based components as the technology of choice.
