Since an electron in an atom has both mass and motion, it contains two types of energy. By virtue of
its motion the electron contains KINETIC ENERGY. Due to its position it also contains POTENTIAL
ENERGY. The total energy contained by an electron (kinetic plus potential) is the factor which
determines the radius of the electron orbit. In order for an electron to remain in this orbit, it must neither
GAIN nor LOSE energy.
