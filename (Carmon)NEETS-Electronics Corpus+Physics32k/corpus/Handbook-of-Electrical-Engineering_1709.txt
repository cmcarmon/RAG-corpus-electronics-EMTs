The quality of the representation of the digital image is also determined by the number of levels or shades
of gray that are used in the quantization. If one has more levels, then fewer mistakes will be made in assigning
values  at  the  output  of  the  transducer.  Figure  17.3  demonstrates  how  the  number  of  gray  levels  affects  the
digital representation of an artery. When a small number of levels are used, the quantization is coarse and the
quantization error is large. The quantization error usually manifests itself in the digital image by the appearance
