Cooling and Feedwater System
The condenser is cooled by cold water. The open-loop system obtains the water from a river or sea, if the power
plant location permits it. The closed-loop system utilizes cooling towers, spray ponds, or spray canals. In the
case of spray ponds or canals, the water is pumped through nozzles, which generate Ô¨Åne sprays. Evaporation
cools  the  water  sprays  as  they  fall  back  into  the  pond.  Several  different  types  of  cooling  towers  have  been
developed.  The  most  frequently  used  is  the  wet  cooling  tower,  where  the  hot  water  is  sprayed  on  top  of  a
latticework of horizontal bars. The water drifts downward and is cooled, through evaporation, by the air, which
is forced by fans or natural draft upward.
