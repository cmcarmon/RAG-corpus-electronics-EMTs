All the lifting surfaces of an aircraft are divided into some number of quadrilateral panels, and a horseshoe vortex and a collocation point (or control point) are placed on each panel. The transverse segment of the vortex is at the 1/4 chord position of the panel, while the collocation point is at the 3/4 chord position. The vortex strength



Γ


{\displaystyle \Gamma }
is to be determined. A normal vector




n



{\displaystyle \mathbf {n} }
is also placed at each collocation point, set normal to the camber surface of the actual lifting surface.
For a problem with



N


{\displaystyle N}
panels, the perturbation velocity at collocation point



i


{\displaystyle i}
is given by summing the contributions of all the horseshoe vortices in terms of an Aerodynamic Influence Coefficient (AIC) matrix

A Neumann boundary condition is applied at each collocation point, which prescribes that the normal velocity across the camber surface is zero.
