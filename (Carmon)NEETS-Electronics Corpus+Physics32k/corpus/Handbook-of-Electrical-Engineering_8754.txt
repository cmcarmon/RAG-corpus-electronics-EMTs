The ﬁrst “equation” states that a procedure treats algorithms and data separately, but the programmer must
understand both the data structure and the algorithms for manipulating the data structures of an application.
This separation between algorithms and data is a key feature of the procedural paradigm. During the 1970s
structured  programming  was  introduced  to  control  the  complexity  of  the  procedural  paradigm. While  only
partially successful, structured programming limited procedures to less powerful control structures by elimi-
nating the GOTO and programs with labels. However, structured programming did not go far enough.
