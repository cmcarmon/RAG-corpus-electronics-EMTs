)2, then the optimal Bayesian
estimate  is  the  conditional  expectation  E{u*x}.  If  x  and  u  are  jointly  Gaussian,  then  the  above  conditional
expectation is a linear function of x. But when the above statistics are not Gaussian, then the optimal Bayesian
estimate is generally a nonlinear function of x. Thus, to resolve this problem we introduce suboptimal Bayesian
schemes for this quadratic penalty function. In particular we consider only the class of linear parameter estimates
and we try to Ô¨Ånd that estimate which minimizes the expected quadratic penalty. This estimate is called linear
MS estimate and it is used in many applications because of the simplicity of the solution.
