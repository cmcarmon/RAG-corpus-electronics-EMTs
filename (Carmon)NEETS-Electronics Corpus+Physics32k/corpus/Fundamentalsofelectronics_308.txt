where the amplitude is either zero or A and each transmitter uses its own frequency fi. Each frequency is
harmonically related to the bit interval duration T , where the transmitter one uses the the frequency 1/T .
The datarate is 10 Mbps.
(a) Draw a block diagram that expresses this communication scenario.
(b) Find circuits that the receivers could employ to separate unwanted transmissions. Assume the received
