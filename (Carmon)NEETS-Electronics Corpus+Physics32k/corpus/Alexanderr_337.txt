When a circuit contains a single
capacitor and several resistors and
dependent sources, the Thevenin
equivalent can be found at the
terminals of the capacitor to form a
simple RC circuit. Also, one can use
Theveninâ€™s theorem when several
capacitors can be combined to form
a single equivalent capacitor.
