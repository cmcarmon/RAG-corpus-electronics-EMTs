When a flexible computer is working in a fixed-word-length environment, each address identifies a 
group of bytes that can be operated on as a unit. This processing method helps to achieve faster 
calculating speeds. A programmer can use program instructions to cause the computer to automatically 
retrieve, manipulate, and store, as a unit, a fixed word of say, two, four, or eight bytes of data in one 
machine operation by identifying the address of the first character of data. At the same time all remaining 
bytes are acted upon as a unit moving from left to right. Figure 4-10 illustrates the different word lengths 
possible with many byte-addressable computers. They are half-word (2 bytes), full-word (4 bytes), and 
double-word (8 bytes).
