After an electrical system has been locked out and tagged with your own personal lock, you
must then double-check to see if the voltage really has been secured in a zero state. One way
to check is to see if the machine (or whatever it is that’s being worked on) will start up if the
Start switch or button is actuated. If it starts, then you know you haven’t successfully secured
the electrical power from it.
