To compute the output at some index, this diﬀerence equation says we need to know what the
previous output y (n − 1) and what the input signal is at that moment of time. In more detail, let’s
compute this system’s output to a unit-sample input: x (n) = δ (n). Because the input is zero for
negative indices, we start by trying to compute the output at n = 0.
