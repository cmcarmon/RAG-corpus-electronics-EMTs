In amplitude modulation, sidebands are produced above and below the carrier frequency. A pulse is 
also produced above and below the carrier frequency, but the pulse is made up of many tones. These tones 
produce multiple sidebands that are commonly referred to as SPECTRAL LINES, or RAILS, on the 
spectrum analyzer display. Twice as many rails will be in the pulse-modulated output of the radar as there 
are harmonics contained in the modulating pulse (upper and lower sidebands), as shown in figure 5-22. In 
the figure, the pulse repetition frequency (prf) is equal to the pulse interval of 1/T. The actual spectrum 
analyzer display would show the lower lobes (shown below the reference line in the figure) on top 
because the spectrum analyzer does not retain any polarity information. Changing the pulse interval, or 
pulse width, of the modulation signal will change the amount of rails (prf), or number of lobe minima, as 
illustrated in figure 5-23.
