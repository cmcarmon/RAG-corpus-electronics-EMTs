The Jaynes-Cummings model is a model in quantum field theory that describes the coupling of a two state quantum mechanical system to a single mode of a bosonic field. It was originally developed to study the interaction of atoms with the quantized electromagnetic field in order to investigate the phenomena of spontaneous emission and absorption of photons in a cavity. It has since been applied to the study of a wide variety of quantum mechanical interactions in quantum optics, solid-state physics, and superconducting circuits. It has applications in coherent control and quantum information processing.
