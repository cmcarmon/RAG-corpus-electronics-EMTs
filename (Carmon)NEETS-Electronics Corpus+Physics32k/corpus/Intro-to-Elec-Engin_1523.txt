The noncoherent ASK system eliminates the need for a coherent local oscillator. Figure
15.3.15 shows the demodulator and code generator for a noncoherent ASK system. A matched
ﬁlter (that has its impulse response matched to have the same form as the carrier pulse at its input)
and envelope detector take the place of the synchronous detector and integrator of Figure 15.3.14.
While ASK systems are not as widely used as other systems for various reasons, the ASK
concept remains signiﬁcant, particularly as applied to modern optical communication systems
which use intensity modulation of a light source.
