Because of the increasing demands of system safety and reli-
ability in modern engineering design, research issues dealing
with failure diagnosis and accommodation have attracted sig-
niﬁcant attention in the control society, as the ﬁrst page of
references at the end of this chapter indicates. System failures
caused by unexpected interference or aging of system compon-
ents will possibly result in changes or changing of system
dynamics. Thus, the original design under the fault-free con-
dition is no longer reliable and possibly leads to instability.
More serious problems, such as the survivability of the system,
may arise when the instability of the system may cause the loss
of human life. The research work dealing with the underlying
