A CFD-DEM model is suitable for the modeling or simulation of fluid-solids or fluid-particles systems. In a typical CFD-DEM model, the phase motion of discrete solids or particles is obtained by the Discrete Element Method (DEM) which applies Newton's laws of motion to every particle and the flow of continuum fluid is described by the local averaged Navierâ€“Stokes equations that can be solved by the traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The model is first proposed by Tsuji et al. The interactions between the fluid phase and solids phase is better modeled according to Newton's third law.
