Programmable logic controllers 
 
Programmable 
are 
microprocessor  based  systems  that  are  used  for 
controlling  a  wide  variety  of  automatic  processes, 
from operating an airport baggage handling system 
to brewing a pint of your favourite lager. PLCs are 
rugged  and  modular  and 
they  are  designed 
specifically  for  operation  in  the  process  control 
environment.  
  The control program for a PLC is usually stored 
in  one  or  more  semiconductor  memory  devices. 
The  program  can  be  entered  (or  modified)  by 
means of a simple hand-held programmer, a laptop 
controller, or downloaded over a local area network 
(LAN). PLC manufacturers include Allen Bradley, 
Siemens and Mitsubishi.
