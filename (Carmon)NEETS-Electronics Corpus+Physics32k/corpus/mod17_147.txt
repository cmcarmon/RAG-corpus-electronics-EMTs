A cw transmitter requires four essential components. These are a generator, amplifier, keyer, and
antenna. We have to generate rf oscillations and have a means of amplifying these oscillations. We also
need a method of turning the rf output on and off (keying) in accordance with the intelligence to be
transmitted and an antenna to radiate the keyed output of the transmitter.
