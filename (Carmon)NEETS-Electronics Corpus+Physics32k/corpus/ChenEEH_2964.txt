Inclusion of a heterojunction in the BJT has been demon-
strated to yield a device with superior microwave properties,
including higher gains and superior noise ﬁgure. The device is
commonly referred to as the heterojunction bipolar transistor
(HBT). Unlike conventional microwave frequency BJT transis-
tors that are Si-based, the HBT typically uses GaAs technology
with a signiﬁcantly higher velocity of electrons in the n-doped
GaAs. Commercial development of the HBT is not nearly as
mature as competing technologies, such as development of the
HEMT. It is therefore expected that signiﬁcant improvements
will be made in these devices, which already show respectable
performance. SiGe HBT transistors have also been successfully
developed.
