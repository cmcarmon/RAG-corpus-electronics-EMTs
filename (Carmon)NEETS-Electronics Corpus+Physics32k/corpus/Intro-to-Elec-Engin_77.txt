An important property of the resistor is its ability to convert energy from electrical form into
heat. The manufacturer generally states the maximum power dissipation of the resistor in watts.
If more power than this is converted to heat by the resistor, the resistor will be damaged due to
overheating. The instantaneous power absorbed by the resistor is given by
