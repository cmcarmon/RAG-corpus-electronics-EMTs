Radar measurement of range, or distance, is made possible because of the properties of radiated
electromagnetic energy. This energy normally travels through space in a straight line, at a constant speed,
and will vary only slightly because of atmospheric and weather conditions. The effects atmosphere and
weather have on this energy will be discussed later in this chapter; however, for this discussion on
determining range, these effects will be temporarily ignored.
