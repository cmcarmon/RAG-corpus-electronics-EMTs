As compared to the traditional circular entry, trail braking reduces the time for the requisite direction change needed to reach the driver's chosen apex. With the traditional corner entry where all deceleration is completed prior to steering input, the vehicle carries a constant speed and radius to the apex. The combined peak tire forces act on the car perpendicular to its direction of travel to accelerate it toward its current turn center. The vehicle takes a circular path to the apex at a constant speed.
In comparison, trail braking splits up the peak force the tire is able to generate partially toward braking (longitudinal force acting on a tangent to the direction of travel,) and partially toward steering (lateral force acting perpendicular to direction of travel.) See the traction circle for more info. The combined vector force acting on the vehicle's center of gravity accelerates it in a more rearward direction as shown in the illustration. This causes the vehicle to travel on a Euler spiral shaped path of constant radius and speed reduction.
