Compute the efÔ¨Åciency of the transformer of Example 11.3.1 corresponding to (a) full load,
0.8 power factor lagging, and (b) one-half load, 0.6 power factor lagging, given that the input
power Poc in the open-circuit conducted at rated voltage is 173 W and the input power Psc in the
short-circuit test conducted at rated current is 650 W.
