If you examine the complete voltage and current curves in part D, you will see that the current 
always arrives at a certain point in the cycle 90 degrees ahead of the voltage, because of the charging and 
discharging action. You know that this time and place relationship between the current and voltage is 
called the phase relationship. The voltage-current phase relationship in a capacitive circuit is exactly 
opposite to that in an inductive circuit. The current of a capacitor leads the voltage across the capacitor by 
90 degrees.
