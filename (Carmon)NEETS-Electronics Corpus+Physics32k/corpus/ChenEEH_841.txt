tion network to become a performance bottleneck in high
speed VLSI systems. The primary source of the load for the
clock signals has shifted from the logic gates to the intercon-
nect, thereby changing the physical nature of the load from a
lumped capacitance (C) to a distributed resistive-capacitive
(RC) load (Bakoglu, 1990; Bothra et al., 1993). These intercon-
nect impedances degrade the on-chip signal waveform shapes
and increase the path delay. Furthermore, statistical variations
of the parameters characterizing the circuit elements along the
clock and data signal paths (caused by the imperfect control of
the manufacturing process and the environment) introduce
ambiguity into the signal timing that cannot be neglected. All
of these changes have a profound impact on both the choice of
synchronous design methodology and on the overall circuit
performance. Among the most important consequences are
increased power dissipated by the clock distribution network
and increasingly challenging timing constraints that must be
satisÔ¨Åed to avoid timing violations (Friedman, 1995; Gaddis
and Lotz, 1996; Gronowski et al., 1996; Vasseghi et al., 1996;
Bowhill et al., 1995). Therefore, the majority of the approaches
used to design a clock distribution network focus on simplify-
ing the performance goals by targeting minimal or zero global
clock skew (Neves and Friedman, 1993; Xi and Dai, 1996;
Neves and Friedman, 1996), which can be achieved by different
routing strategies (Jackson et al., 1990; Tsay, 1993; Chou and
Cheng, 1995; Ito et al., 1995), buffered clock tree synthesis,
symmetric n-ary trees (Gaddis and Lotz, 1996) (most notably
H-trees), or a distributed series of buffers connected as a mesh
(Friedman, 1995, 1997; Bowhill et al., 1995).
