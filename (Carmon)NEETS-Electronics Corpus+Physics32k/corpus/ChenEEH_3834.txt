One of the main difﬁculties when it comes to image processing
applications concerns the large amount of data required to
represent an image. For example, one frame of a standard
deﬁnition digital television image has dimensions 720  480
pixels. Therefore, using 256 gray levels (8 bits) for each color
component, it requires 3  8  720  480 ¼ 8, 294, 400 bits to
be represented. Considering that in digital video applications,
one uses 30 frames/sec, one second of video needs more than
240 Mbits! Thus, for the processing, storage, and transmission
