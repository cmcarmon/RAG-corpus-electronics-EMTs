One method of deÔ¨Åning tracks on an optical disk is by means of pregrooves that are either etched, stamped,
or molded onto the substrate. In grooved media of optical storage, the space between neighboring grooves is
the so-called land [see Fig. 80.23(a)]. Data may be written in the grooves with the land acting as a guard band.
Alternatively, the land regions may be used for recording while the grooves separate adjacent tracks. The groove
depth is optimized for generating an optical signal sensitive to the radial position of the read/write laser beam.
For the push-pull method of track-error detection the groove depth is in the neighborhood of l/8, where l is
the wavelength of the laser beam.
