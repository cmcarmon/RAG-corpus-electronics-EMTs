Thermocouples 
 
Thermocouples  comprise  a  junction  of  dissimilar 
metals which generate an e.m.f. proportional to the 
temperature  differential  which  exists  between  the 
measuring junction and a reference junction. Since 
the  measuring  junction  is  usually  at  a  greater 
temperature than that of the reference junction, it is 
junction.

Furthermore,  the  reference  junction  (i.e.  the  cold 
junction)
is  often  omitted  in  which  case  the 
sensing junction is simply terminated at the signal 
conditioning  board.  This  board 
is  usually 
maintained at, or near, normal room temperatures.
