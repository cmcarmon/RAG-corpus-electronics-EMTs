The Zeeman energy is the interaction energy between the magnetization and any externally applied field. It's written as:





E

Z


=
−

μ

∫

V



M

⋅


H


a



d

V


{\displaystyle E_{\text{Z}}=-\mu _{0}\int _{V}\mathbf {M} \cdot \mathbf {H} _{\text{a}}\mathrm {d} V}

where Ha is the applied field and µ0 is the vacuum permeability.
The Zeeman energy favors alignment of the magnetization parallel to the applied field.
