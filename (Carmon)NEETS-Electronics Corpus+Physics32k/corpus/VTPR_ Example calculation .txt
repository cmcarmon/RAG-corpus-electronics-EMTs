The prediction of a vapor–liquid equilibrium is successful even in mixtures containing supercritical components.

The mixture has to be subcritical though. In the given example carbon dioxide is the supercritical component with Tc=304.19 K and Pc=7475 kPa. The critical point of the mixture lies at T=411 K und P≈15000 kPa. The composition of the mixture is near 78 mole% carbon dioxide und 22 mole% cyclohexane.
VTPR describes this binary mixture quite well, the dew point curve as well as the bubble point curve and the critical point of the mixture.
