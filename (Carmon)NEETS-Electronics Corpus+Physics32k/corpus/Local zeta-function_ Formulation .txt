Given F, there is, up to isomorphism, just one field Fk with




[

F

k


:
F
]
=
k



{\displaystyle [F_{k}:F]=k\,}
,
for k = 1, 2, ... . Given a set of polynomial equations — or an algebraic variety V — defined over F, we can count the number





N

k





{\displaystyle N_{k}\,}

of solutions in Fk and create the generating function

{\displaystyle G(t)=N_{1}t+N_{2}t^{2}/2+N_{3}t^{3}/3+\cdots \,}
.
The correct definition for Z(t) is to make log Z equal to G, and so




Z
=
exp
⁡
(
G
(
t
)
)



{\displaystyle Z=\exp(G(t))\,}

we will have Z(0) = 1 since G(0) = 0, and Z(t) is a priori a formal power series.
Note that the logarithmic derivative

Z

{\displaystyle Z'(t)/Z(t)\,}
