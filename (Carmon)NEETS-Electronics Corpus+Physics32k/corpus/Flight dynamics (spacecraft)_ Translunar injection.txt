This must be timed so that the Moon will be in position to capture the vehicle, and might be modeled to a first approximation as a Hohmann transfer. However, the rocket burn duration is usually long enough, and occurs during the change in flight path angle, so that this is not very accurate, requiring instead integration of a simplified version of the velocity and angle rate equations given above in Powered flight:
