At X-band and above it may also be necessary to include propagation loss due to atmospheric absorption
[Blake, 1986]. This form of the radar range equation is applicable to radar systems using pulse compression or
pulse Doppler waveforms as well as the unmodulated single-pulse case. In many applications, average power
 improvement achievable
is a better measure of system performance than peak power since it indicates the 
with pulse integration over a given interval of time. Hence, the radar range equation can be modiÔ¨Åed such that
