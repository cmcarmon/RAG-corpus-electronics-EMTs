The maximum current rating for an LED is usually referred to as the 
 maximum forward current, which is different from another LED rating, known 
as the peak current or pulse current. The peak or pulse current, which is 
higher than the maximum forward current, is the absolute maximum current  
that you can pass through the LED for a very short period of time. Here, short 
means short â€” on the order of milliseconds. If you confuse forward  current 
with peak current, you may wreck your LED.
