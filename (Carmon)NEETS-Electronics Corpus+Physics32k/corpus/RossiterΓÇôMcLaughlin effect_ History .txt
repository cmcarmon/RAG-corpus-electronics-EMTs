J. R. Holt in 1893 proposed a method to measure the stellar rotation of stars using radial velocity measurements, he predicted that when one star of an eclipsing binary eclipsed the other it would first cover the advancing blueshifted half and then the receding redshifted half. This motion would create a redshift of the eclipsed starâ€™s spectrum followed by a blueshift, thus appearing as a change in the radial velocity in addition to that caused by the orbital motion of the eclipsed star.
The effect is named after Richard Alfred Rossiter and Dean Benjamin McLaughlin.
