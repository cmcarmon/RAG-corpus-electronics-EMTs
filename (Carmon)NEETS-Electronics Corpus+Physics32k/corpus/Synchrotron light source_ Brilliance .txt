When comparing x-ray sources, an important measure of quality of the source is called brilliance. Brilliance takes into account:
Number of photons produced per second
The angular divergence of the photons, or how fast the beam spreads out
The cross-sectional area of the beam
The photons falling within a bandwidth (BW) of 0.1% of the central wavelength or frequency
The resulting formula is:

{\displaystyle {\text{brilliance}}={\frac {\text{photons}}{{\text{second}}\cdot {\text{mrad}}^{2}\cdot {\text{mm}}^{2}\cdot 0.1\%~{\text{BW}}}}}

The greater the brilliance, the more photons of a given wavelength and direction are concentrated on a spot per unit of time.
In most x-ray literature, the units for brilliance appear as:
photons/s/mm2/mrad2/0.1%BW.
