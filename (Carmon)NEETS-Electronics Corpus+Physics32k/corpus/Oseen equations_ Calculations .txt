Oseen considered the sphere to be stationary and the fluid to be flowing with a flow velocity (



U


{\displaystyle U}
) at an infinite distance from the sphere. Inertial terms were neglected in Stokes’ calculations. It is a limiting solution when the Reynolds number tends to zero. When the Reynolds number is small and finite, such as 0.1, correction for the inertial term is needed. Oseen substituted the following flow velocity values into the Navier-Stokes equations.

{\displaystyle u_{1}=u+u_{1}^{'},\qquad u_{2}=u_{2}',\qquad u_{3}=u_{3}'.}

Inserting these into the Navier-Stokes equations and neglecting the quadratic terms in the primed quantities leads to the derivation of Oseen’s approximation:

{\displaystyle u{\partial u_{1}' \over \partial x_{1}}=-{1 \over \rho }{\partial p \over \partial x_{1}}+\nu \nabla ^{2}u_{i}'\qquad \left({i=1,2,3}\right).}

Since the motion is symmetric with respect to



x


{\displaystyle x}
axis and the divergence of the vorticity vector is always zero we get:

{\displaystyle \left(\nabla ^{2}-{U \over 2v}{\partial  \over \partial x}\right)\chi =G(x)=0}

the function

{\displaystyle G(x)}

{\displaystyle x}

{\displaystyle {U \over v}{\partial u' \over \partial x}=\nabla ^{2}u'}

{\displaystyle \varphi ={A_{0} \over Re}+A_{1}{\partial  \over \partial x}{1 \over Re}+A_{2}{\partial ^{2} \over \partial x^{2}}{1 \over Re}+\ldots }

{\displaystyle C_{d}={12 \over Re}\left(1+{3 \over 8}Re\right)}
