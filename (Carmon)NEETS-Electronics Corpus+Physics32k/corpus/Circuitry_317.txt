Voltage multipliers 
 
By  adding  a  second  diode  and  capacitor,  we  can 
increase the output of the simple half-wave rectifier 
that  we  met  earlier.  A  voltage  doubler  using  this 
technique is shown in Fig. 6.25. In this arrangement 
C1  will  charge  to  the  positive  peak  secondary 
voltage whilst C2 will charge to the negative peak 
secondary  voltage.  Since  the  output  is  taken  from 
C1 and C2 connected in series the resulting output 
voltage is twice that produced by one diode alone. 
  The voltage doubler can be extended to produce 
higher  voltages  using  the  cascade  arrangement 
shown in Fig. 6.26. Here C1 charges to the positive 
peak secondary voltage, whilst C2 and C3 charge to 
twice  the  positive  peak  secondary  voltage.  The 
result  is  that  the  output  voltage  is  the  sum  of  the 
voltages across C1 and C3 which is three times the 
voltage that would be produced by a single diode. 
The ladder arrangement shown in Fig. 6.25 can be 
easily extended to provide even higher voltages but 
the  efficiency  of  the  circuit  becomes  increasingly 
impaired and high order voltage multipliers of this 
type are only suitable for providing relatively small 
currents.
