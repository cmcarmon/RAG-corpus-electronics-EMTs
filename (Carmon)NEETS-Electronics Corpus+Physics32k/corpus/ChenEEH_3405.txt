Substations come in a variety of conﬁgurations, and the one
selected in Figure 9.3 is called a breaker-and-a-half. This con-
ﬁguration is used in high-voltage substations containing a
number of transmission lines and transformers as well as
different voltage levels and associated busses. This representa-
tion also includes circuit breakers and busses as the principal
means of switching and/or connecting the power system com-
ponents in a substation. The protective relaying role is to
disconnect the components located or terminated in the sub-
station when a fault occurs. In the case shown in Figure 9.3, the
transmission line is connected to the rest of the system through
two breakers marked up as ‘‘L,’’ the bus is surrounded with
several breakers connected to the bus and marked up as ‘‘B,’’
and the power transformer is connected between the two
voltage level busses with four breakers marked up as ‘‘T.’’ In
the common relaying terminology, all the breakers associated
with a given relaying function are referred to as a bay, hence,
the terminology exists of ‘‘protection bays’’ for a transmission
line, a bus, and a transformer. It may be observed in the high-
voltage substation example, given in Figure 9.3, that each
