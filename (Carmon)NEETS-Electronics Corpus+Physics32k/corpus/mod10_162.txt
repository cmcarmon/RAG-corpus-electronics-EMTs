Without refraction, light waves would pass in straight lines through transparent substances without
any change of direction. Refer back to figure 1-10, which shows refraction of a wave. As you can see, all
rays striking the glass at any angle other than perpendicular are refracted. However, the perpendicular ray,
which enters the glass normal to the surface, continues through the glass and into the air in a straight line
no refraction takes place.
