The ends of the shunt strips are embedded in heavy copper blocks. The blocks are attached to the
meter coil leads and the line terminals. To ensure accurate readings, you should not interchangeably use
the meter leads for a particular ammeter with those for a meter of a different range. Slight changes in lead
length and size may vary the resistance of the meter circuit. If this happens, current will also change and
cause incorrect meter readings. External shunts are generally used where currents greater than 50 amperes
must be measured.
