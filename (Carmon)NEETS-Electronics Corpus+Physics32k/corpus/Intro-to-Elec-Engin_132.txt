1.1.14 A magnetic force exists between two adjacent,
parallel current-carrying wires. Let I1 and I2 be the
currents carried by the wires, and r the separation
between them. Making use of the result of Problem
1.1.13, ﬁnd the force between the wires.
1.1.15 A point charge Q1 = −5 nC is located at (6, 0, 0).
Compute the voltage vba between two points a(1,
0, 0) and b(5, 0, 0). Comment on whether point a
is at a higher potential with respect to point b.
