Increasing the value of the resistor increases the discharge time (again, TC = R Â· C). This increased 
value causes the capacitor to discharge more slowly and produces an output wave shape which is a better 
reproduction of the input wave shape. A disadvantage of increasing the resistance value is that the larger 
resistance increases the discharge time of the capacitor and slows the self-adjustment rate of the circuit, 
particularly in case a sudden decrease in input amplitude should occur. The larger resistance has no effect 
on self-adjustment with a sudden rise in input amplitude. This is because the capacitor charges through 
the small resistance of the conducting diode.
