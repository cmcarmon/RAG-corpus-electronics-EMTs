Record your results in a table showing values of IC,
IL and IS, at each frequency from 100 Hz to 1 kHz. 
Plot graphs showing how the current in each circuit 
varies over the  frequency range 100 Hz to 1 kHz. 
Calculate the resonant frequency of the Lâ€“C circuit 
shown in Fig. 4.26. 
 
Conclusion 
 
Comment on the shape of each graph. Is this what 
you would expect (recall that the current flowing in 
the circuit will be proportional to the reciprocal of 
the  reactance)?  Compare  the  measured  resonant 
frequency with the calculated value. If they are not 
the same suggest reasons for any difference.
