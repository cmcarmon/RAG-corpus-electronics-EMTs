The notion of group velocity is based on a linear approximation to the dispersion relation

{\displaystyle \omega (k)}
near a particular value of



k


{\displaystyle k}
. In this approximation, the amplitude of the wave packet moves at a velocity equal to the group velocity without changing shape. This result is an approximation that fails to capture certain interesting aspects of the evolution a free quantum particle. Notably, the width of the wave packet, as measured by the uncertainty in the position, grows linearly in time for large times. This phenomenon is called the spread of the wave packet for a free particle.
Specifically, it is not difficult to compute an exact formula for the uncertainty

. If the momentum of the initial wave function

{\displaystyle \psi _{0}}
is highly localized, the wave packet will spread slowly and the group-velocity approximation will remain good for a long time. Intuitively, this result says that if the initial wave function has a very sharply defined momentum, then the particle has a sharply defined velocity and will (to good approximation) propagate at this velocity for a long time.
