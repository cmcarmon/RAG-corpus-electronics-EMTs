Attenuation, caused by losses within the system, reduces the size or strength of the signal,
whereas distortion is any alteration of the waveshape itself due to energy storage and/or non-
linearities. Contamination by extraneous signals causes interference, whereas noise emanates
from sources both internal and external to the system. To eliminate any one of these may pose a
challenge to the design engineer.
