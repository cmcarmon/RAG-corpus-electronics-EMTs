As such mixed-signal VLSI ASICs evolve, EDA/CAD tools will also evolve to address the performance and
design issues related to analog circuits and their behavior in a digital circuit environment. In addition, analog
high-level  description  languages  (AHDLs)  are  being  developed  to  support  high-level  speciÔ¨Åcations  of  both
analog and mixed-signal circuits.
