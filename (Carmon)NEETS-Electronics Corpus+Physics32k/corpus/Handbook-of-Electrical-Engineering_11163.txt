the theoretical sensitivity of the electrode is approximately 60 mV/pH. It is not practical to measure the potential
across the membrane directly and so reference electrodes, sensors that can be used to measure electrical potential
of  an  electrolytic  solution,  are  used  to  contact  the  solution  on  either  side  of  the  membrane  to  measure  the
potential  difference  across  it.  The  reference  electrodes  and  the  glass  membrane  are  incorporated  into  the
measure-
structure shown in Fig. 114.4 known as a glass pH electrode. This is an example of a 
ment made using an ion-selective membrane.
