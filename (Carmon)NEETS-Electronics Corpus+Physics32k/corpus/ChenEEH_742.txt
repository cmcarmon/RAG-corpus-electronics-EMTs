The reality, however, is still more complex. A certain per-
centage of the overall time can be spent to memory accesses,
and the remaining part to computational issues, taking into
account the system pipelining and the (large) overlap between
memory accesses and computation (see Figure 2.19). The more
time the overall budget is committed to the memory accesses,
the more restrictions are imposed on the data path schedule
that has less freedom for the ordering and the assignment to
the functional units. As a result (see dotted curve), the Pareto
curve for the data path usually exhibits a cost overhead that is
small and constant for small to medium memory cycle budgets
and that only starts to increase sharply when the memory cycle
budget comes close to the globally available cycle budget (see
Figure 3.19). Due to the fact that Pareto curve, are monoto-
nous in their behavior, the sum of these two curves should
exhibit a (unique) minimum.7 This also advocates for an
