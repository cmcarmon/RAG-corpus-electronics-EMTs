It is to be noted that although these two coefﬁcient vectors are similar, the latter approach excludes the ﬁrst
column of X in the rank-q approximation. As such, it does not achieve the full beneﬁts of the SVD decomposition
and  therefore  typically  yields  marginally  poorer  performance,  as  the  example  to  follow  illustrates.  In  both
methods, the component sinusoids may be graphically identiﬁed by peaks that appear in the detection functional
