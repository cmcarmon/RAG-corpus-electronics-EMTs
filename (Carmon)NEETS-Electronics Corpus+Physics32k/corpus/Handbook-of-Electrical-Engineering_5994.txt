Park’s transformation decouples and rotates the stator variables
of a synchronous machine onto a dq reference frame that is ﬁxed to
the  rotor.  The  positive  d-axis  of  the  dq  frame  is  aligned  with  the
magnetic axis of the ﬁeld winding, that of the positive q-axis is ahead
in the direction of rotation or lead the positive d-axis by π/2. Deﬁned
in this manner, the internal excitation voltage given by Ef = ωLafif is
in the direction of the positive q-axis. Park’s original dq0 transfor-
mation [1929] was expressed in terms of the angle, θ
d, between the
rotor’s d-axis and the axis of the stator’s a-phase winding.
