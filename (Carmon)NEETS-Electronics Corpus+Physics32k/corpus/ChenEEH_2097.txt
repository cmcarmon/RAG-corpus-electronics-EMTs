HPrTNs can be used to model systems using the traditional
structured approach (Yourdon, 1989) or modern object-
oriented approach (Booch, 1994). He and Ding (2001) pro-
posed an approach to realize various object-oriented (OO)
concepts in HPrTNs. Furthermore, He (2000a, 2000b) and
Dong and He (2001) applied HPrTNs to formalize several
diagrams in the Uniﬁed Modeling Language (UML)—a soft-
ware industry standard second-generation object-oriented
modeling language. In the following sections, we brieﬂy de-
scribe how to model several key OO concepts in HPrTNs.
