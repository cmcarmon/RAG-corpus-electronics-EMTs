With analog cellular, or AMPS (Advanced Mobile Phone System), calls are transmitted in
sound waves at 800 MHz to 900 MHz. This was the ﬁrst mobile phone technology available in
early 1980s. Digital cellular, or D-AMPS (Digital AMPS), transmits calls in bits at the same
frequency as analog cellular, with improved sound quality and security. To send numerous calls
at once, D-AMPS phones use either CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) or TDMA (Time
Division Multiple Access) technology; but CDMA phones won’t work in TDMA areas, and vice
versa. A dual-mode unit can switch to analog transmission outside of the more limited digital
network.
