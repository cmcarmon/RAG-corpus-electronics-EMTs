The loop detectors are paired coils of wire placed under the pavement. The impedance of the loop detectors
changes in response to the presence of a car on the roadway. The change in impedance changes the frequency
of an RC oscillator, which is converted to a digital signal reported to the microprocessor. Loop detectors can
be used to monitor the presence of a car at a trafﬁc light, the length of a line of cars, and the speed of trafﬁc.
The function of the trafﬁc controller is to optimize trafﬁc ﬂow. For example, during busy periods of the day,
the  goal  may  be  to  optimize  ﬂow  through  an  intersection. Another  goal  may  be  to  ensure  that  trafﬁc  ﬂows
smoothly in certain directions to effectively feed larger roads. Trafﬁc lights can be synchronized to provide a
highway  through  a  busy  network  of  roads  by  ensuring  that  a  car  that  enters  the  roadway  and  maintains  a
recommended speed can travel along the entire length without stopping at a trafﬁc light. On the other hand,
during periods of low use, such as night and early morning, the system may monitor for the presence of a car
at an intersection and immediately switch the light to let it pass.
