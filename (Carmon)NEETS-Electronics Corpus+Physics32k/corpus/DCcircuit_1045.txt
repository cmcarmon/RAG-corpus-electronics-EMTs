Norton’s Theorem states that it is possible to simplify any linear circuit, no matter how com-
plex, to an equivalent circuit with just a single current source and parallel resistance connected
to a load. Just as with Thevenin’s Theorem, the qualiﬁcation of “linear” is identical to that
found in the Superposition Theorem: all underlying equations must be linear (no exponents or
roots).
