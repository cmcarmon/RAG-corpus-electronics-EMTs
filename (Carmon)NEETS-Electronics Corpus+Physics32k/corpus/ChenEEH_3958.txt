In the early 1960s, most DSP algorithms, such as the fast
Fourier transform (FFT), were implemented in Fortran pro-
grams running on a general-purpose mainframe computer. It
could take hours to process a short 30-second speech. Obvi-
ously, general purpose computing systems were insufﬁcient to
meet the high throughput rate demanded by a real-time signal
processing algorithm. Dedicated application-speciﬁc comput-
ing systems, however, were too expensive to be a realistic
solution for most commercial signal processing applications.
