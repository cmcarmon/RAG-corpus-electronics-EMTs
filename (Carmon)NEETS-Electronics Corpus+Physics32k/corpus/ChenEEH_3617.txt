IIR ﬁlters are usually designed by using analog ﬁlter approxi-
mations that are easy to apply and are well established. IIR ﬁlters
can also be designed by using optimization methods. It is
known, however, that simultaneous approximation of magni-
tude and phase is a difﬁcult problem, and no reliable iterative
design methods are available. The use of optimization methods
in IIR ﬁlter design is more common in equalization problems
when speciﬁcations for both magnitude and phase are given.
