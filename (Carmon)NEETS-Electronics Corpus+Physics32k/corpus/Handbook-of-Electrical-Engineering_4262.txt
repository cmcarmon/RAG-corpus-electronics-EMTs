Track ﬁltering generally provides smoothing and prediction of target position and velocity via a recursive
prediction-correction process. The ﬁlter predicts the target’s position at the time of the next measurement based
on the current smoothed estimates of position, velocity, and possibly acceleration. The subsequent difference
between the measured position at this time and the predicted position is used to update the smoothed estimates.
The  update  process  incorporates  a  weighting  vector  that  determines  the  relative  signiﬁcance  given  the  track
ﬁlter prediction versus the new measurement in updating the smoothed estimate.
