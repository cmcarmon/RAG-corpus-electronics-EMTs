If h is significant with respect to R, as with most satellites, then the approximation made previously is no longer valid, and the exact formula is required:




d
=


2
R
h
+

h

2





,


{\displaystyle d={\sqrt {2Rh+h^{2}}}\,,}

where R is the radius of the Earth (R and h must be in the same units). For example, if a satellite is at a height of 2000 km, the distance to the horizon is 5,430 kilometres (3,370 mi); neglecting the second term in parentheses would give a distance of 5,048 kilometres (3,137 mi), a 7% error.
