The gravitational wave signal indicated that it was produced by the collision of two neutron stars with a total mass of 2.82+0.47
−0.09 times the mass of the sun (solar masses). If low spins are assumed, consistent with those observed in binary neutron stars that will merge within a Hubble time, the total mass is 2.74+0.04
−0.01 M☉.
The masses of the component stars have greater uncertainty. The larger (m1) has a 90% chance of being between 1.36 and 2.26 M☉, and the smaller (m2) has a 90% chance of being between 0.86 and 1.36 M☉. Under the low spin assumption, the ranges are 1.36 to 1.60 M☉ for m1 and 1.17 to 1.36 M☉ for m2.
The chirp mass, a directly observable parameter which may be very roughly equated to the geometric mean of the masses, is measured at 1.188+0.004
−0.002 M☉.
The neutron star merger event is thought to result in a kilonova, characterized by a short gamma ray burst followed by a longer optical "afterglow" powered by the radioactive decay of heavy r-process nuclei. Kilonovae are candidates for the production of half the chemical elements heavier than iron in the Universe. A total of 16,000 times the mass of the Earth in heavy elements is believed to have formed, including approximately ten Earth masses just of the two elements gold and platinum.
A hypermassive neutron star is believed to have formed initially and then collapsed into a black hole within milliseconds, as evidenced by the large amount of ejecta (much of which would have been swallowed by an immediately forming black hole) and the lack of evidence for emissions being powered by neutron star spin-down, which would occur for longer-surviving neutron stars.
