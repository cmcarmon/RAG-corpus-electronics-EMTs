The p.r.f. is adjustable over the range 10 Hz  to 
10 kHz whilst pulse widths can be varied from 50 
Âµs to 50 ms. The output voltage is adjustable from 
0 V to  10  V.  Finally,  R5,  is  included  in  order  to 
limit  the  output  current  and  provide  a  measure  of 
protection in the event of a short-circuit present at 
the output.
