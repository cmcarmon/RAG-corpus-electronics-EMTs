Instead of using the internal case head diameter, the external case head base diameter can also be measured with a caliper or micrometer or taken from the appropriate C.I.P. or SAAMI cartridge or chamber data tables and used for bolt thrust estimation calculations.
The basic calculation method is almost the same, but now the larger outside area of the cartridge case head is used instead of the smaller inside area.

{\displaystyle {\vec {F_{bolt}}}=P_{max}\cdot A_{external}.}

where:
Fbolt = the amount of bolt thrust
Pmax = the maximum (peak) chamber pressure of the firearms cartridge
Aexternal = the outside area of the cartridge case head
This method is fine for getting a good estimate regarding bolt thrust and assumes an overly large area that the gas pressure acts against yielding pessimistic estimations, generating a safety margin in the process for worse case scenarios which can result in increased maximum (peak) chamber pressure of the firearms cartridge, like a round that is chambered in an already very warm chamber that can result in cooking off (i.e. a thermally induced unintended firing).
