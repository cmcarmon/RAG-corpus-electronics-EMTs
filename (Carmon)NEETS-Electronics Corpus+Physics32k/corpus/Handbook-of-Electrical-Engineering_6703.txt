As of this writing, advances in LANs design and new forms of LANs are emerging. One example is wireless
LANs, which are LANs in which radio or photonic links serve as cable replacements. Wireless LAN technology
is viewed by many as crucial to the evolution of personal communication networks. Another example is the
asynchronous transfer mode-based LAN, which is mentioned in the next section following a general discussion
of asynchronous transfer mode.
