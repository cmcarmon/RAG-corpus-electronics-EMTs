The bistable multivibrator circuit and the associated waveforms are shown in figure 3-17, views (A) 
and (B), respectively. In this circuit, R1 and R7 are the collector load resistors. Voltage dividers R1, R2, 
and R5 provide forward bias for Q2; R7, R6, and R3 provide forward bias for Q1. These resistors also 
couple the collector signal from one transistor to the base of the other. Observe that this is direct coupling 
of feedback. This type of coupling is required because the circuit depends on input triggers for operation, 
not on RC time constants inside the circuit. Both transistors use common emitter resistor R4 which 
provides emitter coupling. C1 and C2 couple the input triggers to the transistor bases.
