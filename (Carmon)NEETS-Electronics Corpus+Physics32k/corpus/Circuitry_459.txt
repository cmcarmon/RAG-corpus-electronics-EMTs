180    ELECTRONIC CIRCUITS: FUNDAMENTALS AND APPLICATIONS 
Conclusion 
Comment  on 
the  astable 
oscillator.  Is  this  what  you  would  expect?  Do  the 
measured  values  agree  with  those  obtained  by 
calculation?  If  not,  suggest  reasons  for  any 
differences.  Suggest  typical  applications  for  the 
circuit.
