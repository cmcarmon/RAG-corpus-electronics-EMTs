Prior to the implementation of the ET-DSP, site information such as surface infrastructure, surrounding land uses, short term site usage during remediation, subsurface lithology, depth to groundwater, plume characterization, type of contaminant, distribution of the contaminant and required time to attain target temperatures is collected. Numerical modeling and analysis simulation software combined with bench-scale experiments are used to determine the optimal thermal remediation strategy for the site.
Numerical modeling is important to determine optimum electrode configuration in terms of pattern type, shape, and separation; power supply requirements; power synchronization; optimal target temperature; and estimated time to attain the targeted temperature.
