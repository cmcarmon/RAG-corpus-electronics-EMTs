3. Interconnection. Use of line lengths of up to 10 in. (5 in. for 74S) requires no particular precautions,
except that in some critical situations lines cannot run side by side for an appreciable distance without
causing cross talk due to capacitive coupling between them. For transmission line connections, a gate
should drive only one line, and a line should be terminated in only one gate input. If overshoots are a
problem, a 25- to 50-W resistor should be used in series with the driving gate input and the receiving
gate input should be pulled up to 5 V through a 1-kW resistor. Driving and receiving gates should have
their own decoupling capacitors between the VCC and ground pins. Parallel lines should have a grounded
line separating them to avoid cross talk.
