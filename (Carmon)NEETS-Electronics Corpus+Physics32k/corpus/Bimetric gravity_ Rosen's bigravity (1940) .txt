In general relativity (GR), it is assumed that the distance between two points in spacetime is given by the metric tensor. Einstein's field equation is then used to calculate the form of the metric based on the distribution of energy and momentum.
Rosen (1940) has proposed that at each point of space-time, there is a Euclidean metric tensor




γ

i
j




{\displaystyle \gamma _{ij}}
in addition to the Riemannian metric tensor




g

i
j




{\displaystyle g_{ij}}
. Thus at each point of space-time there are two metrics:




1.




d

g

{\displaystyle 1.~~~~ds^{2}=g_{ij}dx^{i}dx^{j}}

j




{\displaystyle 2.~~~~d\sigma ^{2}=\gamma _{ij}dx^{i}dx^{j}}

The first metric tensor,




g

i
j




{\displaystyle g_{ij}}
, describes the geometry of space-time and thus the gravitational field. The second metric tensor,




γ

i
j




{\displaystyle \gamma _{ij}}
, refers to the flat space-time and describes the inertial forces. The Christoffel symbols formed from




g

i
j




{\displaystyle g_{ij}}
and




γ

i
j




{\displaystyle \gamma _{ij}}
are denoted by




{

j
k


i


}


{\displaystyle \{_{jk}^{i}\}}
and




Γ

j
k


i




{\displaystyle \Gamma _{jk}^{i}}
respectively.
Since the difference of two connections is a tensor, one can define the tensor field




Δ

j
k


i




{\displaystyle \Delta _{jk}^{i}}
given by:

Two kinds of covariant differentiation then arise:



g


{\displaystyle g}
-differentiation based on




g

i
j




{\displaystyle g_{ij}}
(denoted by a semicolon), and covariant differentiation based on




γ

i
j




{\displaystyle \gamma _{ij}}
(denoted by a slash). Ordinary partial derivatives are represented by a comma. Let




R

i
j
k


h




{\displaystyle R_{ijk}^{h}}
and




P

i
j
k


h




{\displaystyle P_{ijk}^{h}}
be the Riemann curvature tensors calculated from




g

i
j




{\displaystyle g_{ij}}
and




γ

i
j




{\displaystyle \gamma _{ij}}
, respectively. In the above approach the curvature tensor




P

i
j
k


h




{\displaystyle P_{ijk}^{h}}
is zero, since




γ

i
j




{\displaystyle \gamma _{ij}}
is the flat space-time metric.
A straightforward calculation yields the Riemann curvature tensor

Each term on right hand side is a tensor. It is seen that from GR one can go to the new formulation just by replacing {:} by



Δ


{\displaystyle \Delta }
and ordinary differentiation by covariant

{\displaystyle \gamma }
-differentiation,

. Having once introduced

j




{\displaystyle \gamma _{ij}}
into the theory, one has a great number of new tensors and scalars at one's disposal. One can set up other field equations other than Einstein's. It is possible that some of these will be more satisfactory for the description of nature.
The geodesic equation in bimetric relativity (BR) takes the form

It is seen from equations (1) and (2) that



Γ


{\displaystyle \Gamma }
can be regarded as describing the inertial field because it vanishes by a suitable coordinate transformation.
The quantity



Δ


{\displaystyle \Delta }
, being a tensor, is independent of any coordinate system and hence may be regarded as describing the permanent gravitational field.
Rosen (1973) has found BR satisfying the covariance and equivalence principle. In 1966, Rosen showed that the introduction of the space metric into the framework of general relativity not only enables one to get the energy momentum density tensor of the gravitational field, but also enables one to obtain this tensor from a variational principle. The field equations of BR derived from the variational principle are

{\displaystyle K_{j;i}^{i}=0,}

which implies that in a BR, a test particle in a gravitational field moves on a geodesic with respect to

{\displaystyle g_{ij}.}

It is found that the BR and GR theories differ in the following cases:

propagation of electromagnetic waves
the external field of a high density star
the behaviour of intense gravitational waves propagating through a strong static gravitational field.

The predictions of gravitational radiation in Rosen's theory have been shown to be in conflict with observations of the Hulse–Taylor binary pulsar.
