Much of current research is focused on automating the opti-
mal partitioning of large circuits into smaller ones to ﬁt into
available FPGA resources and the scheduling of the resulting
components (Purna and Bhatia, 1999; Kaul and Vemuri, 2000;
Liu and Wong, 1999). Run-time reconﬁguration can then be
performed to swap between the smaller circuits, thus effec-
tively implementing the large circuit in an FPGA, which is
physically smaller than the original circuit. If this goal
is
achieved, circuit designers would not need to worry whether
their design ﬁts in the available chip. Multichip partitioning
algorithms could be used, however, the partitioning algorithm
would need to partition the circuit to maximize the overlap
between multiple partitions. Tools for identifying the reconﬁg-
urable regions and positioning components (Shirazi, et al.,
1998a) can then be applied to maximize physical overlap,
thus reducing partial reconﬁguration time.
