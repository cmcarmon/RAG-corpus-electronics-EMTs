In phase modulation the oscillator does not deviate, and the power in the sidebands is a function of
the amplitude of the modulating signal. Therefore, two signals, one at 5 kilohertz and the other at 10
kilohertz, used to modulate a carrier would have the same sideband power distribution. However, the
10-kilohertz sidebands would be farther apart, as shown in views (C) and (D) of figure 2-21. When
compared to fm, the bandwidth of the pm transmitted signal is greatly increased as the frequency of the
modulating signal is increased.
