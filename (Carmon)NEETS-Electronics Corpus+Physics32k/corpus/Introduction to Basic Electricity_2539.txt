The Bode	plotter in Multisim allows the user 
to produce a graph of a circuit’s frequency response 
and is quite useful in analyzing filter circuits. The 
 plotter measures a signal’s voltage gain or phase shift. 
When the plotter is attached to a circuit, a frequency- 
amplitude and phase-angle analysis is performed.
