Cranes and derricks are proof tested when called on for potentially dangerous load levels or high-valued cargoes. Similarly, items which are smaller and more common (rope and cable, slings, shackles and eyes) are nevertheless in the load path and a failure risk if not tested. Testing generally involves lifting weight or drawing tension equal to or greater than design levels.
