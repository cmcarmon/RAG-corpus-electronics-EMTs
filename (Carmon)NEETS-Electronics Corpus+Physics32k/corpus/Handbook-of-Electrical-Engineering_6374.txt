RF power levels of just a few tens of watts per program channel have been used in system demonstrations,
providing a relatively wide coverage area, depending on the height of the transmitting antenna above surround-
ing terrain. This low power level is possible because the system can operate at a C/N ratio of less than 10 dB,
as opposed to the more than 30 dB that is required for high-ﬁdelity demodulation of analog FM broadcasts.
Another demonstrated capability of the system is its ability to use “gap ﬁller” transmitters to augment signal
coverage in shadowed areas. A gap ﬁller is simply a system that directly receives the DAB signal at an unob-
structed location, provides RF ampliﬁcation, and retransmits the signal, on the same channel, into the shadowed
area. Because the system can make constructive use of signal reﬂections (within a time window deﬁned by the
guard interval and other factors), the demodulated signal is uninterrupted on a mobile receiver when it travels
between an area served by the main signal into the service area of the gap ﬁller.
