To operate this instrument, the technician would manually adjust the output of the preci-
sion voltage source until the null detector indicated exactly zero (if using audio headphones
as the null detector, the technician would repeatedly press and release the pushbutton switch,
listening for silence to indicate that the circuit was ”balanced”), and then note the source volt-
age as indicated by a voltmeter connected across the precision voltage source, that indication
being representative of the voltage across the lower 250 MΩ resistor:
