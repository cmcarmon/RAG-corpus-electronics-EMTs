Step 7. The objective clock skews are chosen at the center of the
permissible range for all local data paths. The actual
clock skews (a consistent clock schedule) are calculated
as described by equation 4.97 and as illustrated in
Figure 4.9. At this point, each clock skew is veriﬁed
against the respective permissible range. If all skews are
in the respective permissible range bounds, the algo-
rithm concludes. Otherwise, the objective clock skews
are modiﬁed, and the calculation is repeated again.
Only the calculation described in this step must be
repeated since all matrices have now been computed.
