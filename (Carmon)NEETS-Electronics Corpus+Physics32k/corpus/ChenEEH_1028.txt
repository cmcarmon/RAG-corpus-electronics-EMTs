executing software programs. The hardware platform mainly
consists of execution units, storage units, and communication
and interface networks, whereas the software part consists of
application and system software. Addressing the power dissi-
pation at this level has the greatest inﬂuence on power dissipa-
tion; as much as a 400% power savings could be achieved
(Stammerman et al., 2001). The effective techniques at this
level include but are not limited to instruction-level optimiza-
tion, hardware–software codesign, memory design techniques,
dynamic power management, and variable-voltage techniques.
Most of the material related to system-level optimization tech-
niques can be found in Benini and de Micheli (1999) and
(2000).
