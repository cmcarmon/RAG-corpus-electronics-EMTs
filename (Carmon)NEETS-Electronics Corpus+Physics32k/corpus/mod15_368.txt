As the gyro precesses, it exerts a precessional force against the springs that is proportional to the 
momentum of the spinning wheel and the applied force. For example, suppose you rotate the gyro case 
(fig. 3-15) at a speed corresponding to a horizontal force of 2 pounds at F. Obviously, the gyro will 
precess; and as it does, it will cause the crossarm to pull up on spring A with a certain force, say 1 pound. 
(This amount of force would vary with the length of the crossarm.)
