Because a flip‐flop’s output stays high (or low) until triggered (or reset), it 
can be used to store a data bit. (Remember, a bit is a 0 or a 1, which is a low 
voltage or a high voltage, respectively.) The registers used to store tempo-
rary outputs between stages of logic consist of multiple flip‐flops. Flip‐flops 
are also used in certain digital‐counter circuits, holding bits in a series of 
interconnected registers that form an array, the outputs of which make up a 
bit string representing the count. (Refer to the sidebar, “Storing bits in regis-
ters,” earlier in this chapter, for more information on registers.)
