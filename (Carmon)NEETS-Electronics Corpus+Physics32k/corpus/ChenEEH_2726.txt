where c ¼ 1=
is the speed of light in the material being
modeled. Equation 9.25 is the general numerical dispersion
relation of the Yee (1966) algorithm for the TMz mode.
We shall consider the important special case of a square-
cell grid having Dx ¼ Dy ¼ D. Then, deﬁning the Courant
stability factor S ¼ cDt=D and the grid sampling density
Nl ¼ l0=D, we rewrite equation 9.25 in a more useful form:
