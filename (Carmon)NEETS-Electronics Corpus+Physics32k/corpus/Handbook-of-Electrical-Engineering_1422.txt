Both time domain and frequency domain analysis techniques have been used to estimate the degree of voicing
for a short segment or frame of speech. One time domain feature, termed the zero crossing rate, is the number
of  times  the  signal  changes  sign  in  a  short  interval. As  shown  in  Fig. 15.7,  the  zero  crossing  rate  for  voiced
sounds is relatively low. Since unvoiced speech typically has a larger proportion of high-frequency energy than
voiced  speech,  the  ratio  of  high-frequency  to  low-frequency  energy  is  a  frequency  domain  technique  that
provides information on voicing.
