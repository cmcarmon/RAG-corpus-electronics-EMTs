. Interpixel redundancy: For the case of image data, re-
dundancy will always be present if only the coding redun-
dancy is explored and however rigorously it is minimized
by using state-of-the-art variable length coding tech-
niques. The reason for this is that images are typically
composed of objects that have a regular and somewhat
predictable morphology and reﬂectance and the pixel
values are highly correlated. The value of any pixel can
be reasonably predicted from the value of its neighbors;
the information carried by each individual pixel is rela-
tively small. To exploit this property of the images, it is
often necessary to convert the visual information of the
image into somewhat nonvisual format that better reﬂects
the correlation between the pixels. The most effective
technique in this regard is to transform the image into
frequency domain by taking the discrete fourier trans-
form (DFT), discrete cosine transform (DCT) or any
other such transform.
