Standard synchros are designed to withstand surrounding temperatures ranging from −67º F to +257º 
F (-55º C to +125º C) at the terminal board. Prestandard synchros operate in a range of −13º F to +185º F 
(-25º C to +85º C). When a synchro is energized and not loaded, its temperature should stay within 
prescribed limits. Loading an energized synchro causes it to generate more heat. Similarly, overloading 
causes a synchro to generate much more heat than it would under normal loading conditions and could 
possibly result in permanent synchro damage. To meet military specifications, all standard synchros must 
be capable of continuous operation for 1,000 hours at 1,200 revolutions per minute (rpm) without a load.
