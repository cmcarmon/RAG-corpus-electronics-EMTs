Another	way	that	you	can	take	your	knowledge	in	circuitry	up	a	notch	is	to
consider	a	career	in	robotics	engineering.	Due	to	your	familiarity	with	a	circuit,
you	can	begin	honing	your	skills	in	creating	coherent	circuits;	you	can	construct	a
series	that	is	dependent	on	the	individual	circuits	to	deliver	its	primary	function.
As	you	commit	to	robotics,	like	in	programming,	a	lineup	of	new	skills	(e.g.
artificial	intelligence	developments,	dynamics,	motion	planning	techniques,
mapping	tactics,	etc.)	must	be	acquired,	too.	This	time,	other	than	your	hand	in
circuits	and	other	electronic	components,	you	have	to	visit	aspects	in	the
mechanical	fields.	However,	given	your	exposure	to	similar	concepts	in	circuitry,
learning	in	the	field	may	not	be	a	challenge.
With	your	expertise	in	circuits,	you	can	be	behind	innovative	and	extraordinary
robotics	projects	that	can	be	advantageous	for	both	commercial	and	personal	use.
It	just	takes	a	matter	of	determination	to	move	forward,	and	the	fact	remains	that	a
course	in	circuit	engineering	can	present	you	with	a	satisfying	place	in	robotics,	as
