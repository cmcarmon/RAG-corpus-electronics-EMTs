Facsimile was invented by Alexander Bain in 1842; Bain’s system used a synchronized pendulum arrangement
to send a facsimile of dot patterns and record them on electrosensitive paper. Over the years, much technological
development has taken place to make facsimile a practical and affordable document transmission process. An
equally  important  role  in  the  wide  acceptance  of  facsimile  for  image  transmission  has  been  the  adoption  of
standards by the Consultative Committee on International Telephone and Telegraph (CCITT). The advent of
a nationwide dial telephone network in the 1960s provided impetus for the rebirth of facsimile after television
put the damper on early facsimile use. Group 2 fax machines which appeared in the mid-1970s were capable
of transmitting a page within a couple of minutes. These machines, based on analog transmission methods,
were developed by Graphic Sciences and 3M. The Group 3 fax machines, developed in the mid-1970s by the
Japanese, are based on digital transmission technology and are capable of transmitting a page in 20 seconds or
less.  They  can  automatically  switch  to  an  analog  mode  to  communicate  with  the  older  Group  1  and  2  fax
machines. Group 4 fax units offer the highest resolution at the fastest rates but rely on digital telephone lines
which are just now becoming widely available [Quinn, 1989]. Group 3 facsimile will be featured in the remainder
of  this  article.  Group  3  facsimile  refers  to  apparatus  which  is  capable  of  transmitting  an  8.5 ·  11-inch  page
over telephone-type circuits in one minute or less. Detailed standards for Group 3 equipment may be found
in Recommendation T.4 of CCITT, Vol. VII.
