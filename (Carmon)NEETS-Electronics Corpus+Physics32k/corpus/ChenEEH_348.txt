Similarly, for a Ô¨Åxed drain bias, a larger body bias increases
the reverse bias on the drain junction and, thus, has the same
effect as increasing the drain bias. Lowering of the threshold
voltage due to DIBL is demonstrated in Figure 3.17. Note that
the effect of body bias on threshold voltage for large channel
MOSFETs is determined by equation 3.15. Here we are inter-
ested in lowering of the threshold voltage due to body bias only
for short channel lengths.
