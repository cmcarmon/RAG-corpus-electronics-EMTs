A source of spherical aberrations in optical disk systems is the substrate through which the light must travel
to reach the active layer of the disk. Figure 80.25(c) shows the bending of the rays at the disk surface that causes
the aberration. This problem can be solved by taking into account the effects of the substrate in the design of
the  objective,  so  that  the  lens  is  corrected  for  all  aberrations  including  those  arising  at  the  substrate.  Recent
developments in molding of aspheric glass lenses have gone a long way in simplifying the lens design problem.
Figure 80.26  shows  a  pair  of  molded  glass  aspherics  designed  for  optical  disk  system  applications;  both  the
collimator and the objective are single-element lenses and are corrected for aberrations.
