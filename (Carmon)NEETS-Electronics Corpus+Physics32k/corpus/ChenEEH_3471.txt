The most common relaying principles used for induction
motor protection are the overcurrent protection and thermal
protection. The overcurrent protection needs to be properly
set to differentiate between various changes in the currents
caused either by faults or excessive starting conditions. A
variety of current-based principles can be used to implement
different protection tasks that ﬁt the motor design properties.
Both the phase and ground overcurrents, as well as the differ-
ential current relays, are commonly used for detecting the
phase and ground faults. The thermal relays are available in
several forms: a ‘‘replica’’ type, where the motor-heating char-
acteristics are approximated closely with a bimetallic element
behavior; resistance temperature detectors embedded in the
motor winding; and relays that operate on a combination of
current and temperature changes.
