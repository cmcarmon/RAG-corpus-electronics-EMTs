(that’s what sound is) move the diaphragm of 
a microphone, which produces corresponding 
variations in electrical current. That fluctuating 
current is a representation of the original sound, 
or an audio signal.
Digital systems, like computers, can’t handle 
continuous analog signals, so electrical signals 
must  be  converted  into  digital  format  before 
entering the depths of a digital system. Digital 
format is just another coding scheme, one that 
uses only the binary values 1 and 0 to represent 
information, much like Morse code uses dots 
and dashes. A digital signal is created by sam-
pling the value of an analog signal at regular 
intervals in time and converting each value into 
a string of bits, or binary digits.
