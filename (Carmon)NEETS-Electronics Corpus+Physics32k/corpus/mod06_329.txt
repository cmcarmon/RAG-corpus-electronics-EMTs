At ultrahigh frequencies, the problems of producing small tube elements while reducing the spacing
between elements become very difficult. Not only are the elements hard to keep parallel with each other
during the manufacturing process, but they also have a tendency to warp and sag under normal operating
conditions. Since these elements are already as close together as possible, any reduction in element
spacing can cause arcing. Therefore, a new type of tube was developed to prevent arcing or element
sagging in conventional tubes. This tube is known as the planar tube.
