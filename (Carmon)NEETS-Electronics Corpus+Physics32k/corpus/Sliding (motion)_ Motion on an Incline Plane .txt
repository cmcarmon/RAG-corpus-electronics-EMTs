One of the most common physics problems in introductory physics classes is a block subject to friction as it slides up or down an incline plane.
In this case the force of gravity is accounted for and is given by:





F

g


=
m
g
sin
⁡

θ



{\displaystyle F_{g}=mg\sin {\theta }}

The force of friction opposes the motion of the block and the normal force (perpendicular to the surface is given by:




N
=
m
g
cos
⁡

θ



{\displaystyle N=mg\cos {\theta }}

Therefore:





F

k


=

μ

k


⋅
m
g
cos
⁡

θ



{\displaystyle F_{k}=\mu _{k}\cdot mg\cos {\theta }}

To find the coefficient of kinetic friction on an incline plane, one must find the moment where the force parallel to the plane is equal to the force perpendicular; this occurs when the block is moving at a constant velocity at some angle



θ


{\displaystyle \theta }





∑
F
=
m
a
=
0


{\displaystyle \sum F=ma=0}






F

k


=

F

g




{\displaystyle F_{k}=F_{g}}
or




μ

k


m
g

θ

=
m
g
sin
⁡

θ



{\displaystyle \mu _{k}mg\cos {\theta }=mg\sin {\theta }}

Here it is found that:

m
g

θ



m
g
cos
⁡

θ




=
tan
⁡

θ



{\displaystyle \mu _{k}={\frac {mg\sin {\theta }}{mg\cos {\theta }}}=\tan {\theta }}
where



θ


{\displaystyle \theta }
is the angle at which the block begins moving at a constant velocity
