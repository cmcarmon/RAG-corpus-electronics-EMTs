13.4.19 A dc series motor, with a design constant Ka =
40 and ﬂux per pole of 46.15 mWb, operates at
200 V while taking a current of 325 A. The total
series-ﬁeld and armature-circuit resistances are
25 and 50 m, respectively. The core loss is 220
W; friction and windage loss is 40 W. Determine:
(a) The electromagnetic torque developed.
(b) The motor speed.
(c) The mechanical power output.
(d) The motor efﬁciency.
