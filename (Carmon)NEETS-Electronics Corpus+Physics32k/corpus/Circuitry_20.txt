Exponent notation 
 
Exponent notation (or scientific notation) is useful 
when  dealing  with  either  very  small  or  very  large 
quantities. It’s well worth getting to grips with this 
notation as it will allow you to simplify quantities 
before using them in formulae. 
  Exponents  are  based  on  powers  of  ten.  To 
express a number in exponent notation the number 
is  split  into  two  parts.  The  first  part  is  usually  a 
number  in  the  range  0.1  to  100  while  the  second 
part is a multiplier expressed as a power of ten. 
  For example, 251.7 can be expressed as 2.517 ×
100,  i.e.  2.517  × 102. It  can  also  be  expressed  as 
0.2517 × 1,000, i.e. 0.2517 × 103. In both cases the 
exponent is the  same as the  number of noughts in 
the  multiplier  (i.e.  2  in  the  first  case  and  3  in  the 
second case). To summarize: 
 
251.7 = 2.517 × 102 = 0.2517 × 103
