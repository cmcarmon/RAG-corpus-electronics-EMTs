This chapter also includes a brief discussion of signal detec-
tion. The signal detection problem is presented as one of
binary hypothesis testing. Both Bayesian and Neyman-Pearson
optimum criteria are presented and shown to be implemented
with likelihood ratio tests. The principles of hypothesis testing
also Ô¨Ånd a wide range of applications that involve decision
making.
