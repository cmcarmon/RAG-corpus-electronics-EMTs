where Rt is the net resistance measured between the two terminals when all
internal independent sources are set to zero. Resistance Rt is called the Th√©venin
Equivalent Resistance. From Figure 3.55d, vb is obviously just the voltage
appearing at the terminals of the original network when no current is flowing;
we call this the open-circuit voltage. That is,
vb = voc.
