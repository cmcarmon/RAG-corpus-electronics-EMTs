Nuclear density meters work on the principle of measuring gamma radiation. Gamma radiation is emitted from a source. This source is typically Cesium-137 (half-life: ~30 years). The radiation is seen by a scintillator device. The radiation is converted into flashes of light. The number of flashes of light is counted. Radiation that is absorbed by the mass is not seen by the scintillator device. Therefore, the density of the media is inversely proportional to the radiation captured and seen by the scintillator.
Nuclear density meters are limited in scope to what is seen by the gamma radiation beam. The sample size is a single, thin column with small longitudinal length.
Nuclear equipment requires certified and licensed staff in order to operate the instruments.
