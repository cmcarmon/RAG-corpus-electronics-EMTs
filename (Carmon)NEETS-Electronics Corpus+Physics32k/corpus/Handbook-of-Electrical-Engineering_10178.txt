Various more sophisticated approaches have been taken to justify robotic and automated system implemen-
tation. Estimates of indirect factors such as taxes, capital gain or losses, variability consideration, and associated
expected value analysis along with decision tree analysis and Markovian decision analysis [Michel, 1986] are
but a few methods to justify such systems. Other factors to be recognized in robotic justiﬁcation are that robots
are reusable from one project to the next and there is a difference in production rates for a robotic implemen-
tation over a manual process. A changeover from a manual method to a robotic implementation would have
the  potential  to  affect  revenues  for  any  project.  Many  companies  have  also  developed  standard  investment
analysis forms for an economic evaluation of a proposed robot project. These forms are helpful in displaying
costs and savings for a project. Groover et al. [1986] presents one such proposed form and gives several references
to examples of forms speciﬁcally designed for projects devoted to robotics and related automation areas.
