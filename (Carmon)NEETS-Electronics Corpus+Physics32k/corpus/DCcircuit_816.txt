Since we don’t want to measure these stray wire and connection resistances, but only mea-
sure Rx, we must ﬁnd some way to connect the null detector so that it won’t be inﬂuenced by
voltage dropped across them. If we connect the null detector and RM /RN ratio arms directly
across the ends of Ra and Rx, this gets us closer to a practical solution:
