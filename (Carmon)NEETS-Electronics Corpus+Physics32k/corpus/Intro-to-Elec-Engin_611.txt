6.1.16 Figure P6.1.16(a) shows the seven-segment array
that is widely used to form the decimal digits 0 to 9
in LED displays, as indicated in Figure P6.1.16(b).
Let the inputs be the four binary digits used to
represent the decimal digits 0 to 9. (a) For the
segment Y1, (b) For the segment Y2, and (c) For
the segment Y3 to be turned on, develop the logic
expression and Ô¨Ånd one possible logic circuit to
realize the output in each case.
