random variable that is usually observable. Derivations of
Bayesian estimation algorithms depend critically on the a
posteriori distribution of the underlying signals (or signal
parameters) to be estimated. Those a posteriori distributions
are obtained by employing Bayesâ€™ rules, thus the name Baye-
sian estimation.
