The following analysis is taken largely from the work of Burton and Bush, and offers some mathematical insight into the role that flexibility plays in improving load-bearing characteristics of floating objects.
Consider two plates of infinite width, thickness



t


{\displaystyle t}
, and length



b


{\displaystyle b}
that are connected by a torsional spring with spring constant per unit width




K

s




{\displaystyle K_{s}}
. Furthermore, let



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }
be the angle between a plate and the horizontal, and



ϕ


{\displaystyle \phi }
the from where the meniscus meets the plate to the horizontal. The distance from the undisturbed water line to the plate's outer edge is



h


{\displaystyle h}
. The density of water is



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
, the density of air is considered negligible, and the plate density,




ρ

s




{\displaystyle \rho _{s}}
, shall be varied. All systems naturally assume a configuration that minimizes total energy. Thus, the goal of this analysis is to identify the configurations (i.e., values of



h


{\displaystyle h}
and



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }
) that result in a stable equilibrium for a given value of




ρ

s




{\displaystyle \rho _{s}}
.
For a total system energy of



Π


{\displaystyle \Pi }
, it is natural to distinguish sub-components:




Π
=
U
−
V


{\displaystyle \Pi =U-V}





V


{\displaystyle V}
: Work done on the system




U


{\displaystyle U}
: System potential energy
In defining



V


{\displaystyle V}
, there are several associated components:




V

{\displaystyle V=W_{H,i}+W_{H,p}-W_{g,p}+W_{\sigma }}






W

H
,
i




{\displaystyle W_{H,i}}
is the work done on the interface by hydrostatic pressure





W

H
,
p




{\displaystyle W_{H,p}}
is the work done on the plates by hydrostatic pressure





W

g
,
p




{\displaystyle W_{g,p}}
is the work done on the plates by gravitational force





W

σ




{\displaystyle W_{\sigma }}
is the work done on the plates by surface tension forces
Similarly, the system potential energy,



U


{\displaystyle U}
, is taken to be composed of two terms:



U
=
S
+

E

s




{\displaystyle U=S+E_{s}}





S


{\displaystyle S}
is the surface energy of the water/air interface





E

s




{\displaystyle E_{s}}
is the energy stored in the torsional spring and is equal to




E

/

2


{\displaystyle E_{s}=K_{s}(2\alpha )^{2}/2}

There are two ways in which the system energy can change by an incremental amount. The first is a translation of the center of mass of the plates by some distance



δ
h


{\displaystyle \delta h}
. The second is an incremental change,



δ
α


{\displaystyle \delta \alpha }
in the hinge angle. Such a change will induce a new moment.
As mentioned, the system will seek the orientation that minimizes

{\displaystyle \delta \Pi =\delta U-\delta V}
in order to find point of stable equilibrium. Writing out these terms more explicitly:

Here,

{\displaystyle \eta (x)}

δ
ϵ


{\displaystyle \delta \epsilon }
is the incremental displacement of the interface, and



σ


{\displaystyle \sigma }
is the surface tension of water.
For a given value of




ρ

s




{\displaystyle \rho _{s}}
, stable equilibrium configurations are identified as being those values of



h


{\displaystyle h}
and



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }
that satisfy

{\displaystyle {\frac {\delta \Pi }{\delta h}}=0}

{\displaystyle {\frac {\delta \Pi }{\delta \alpha }}=0}

Taken in a different light, these conditions can be seen as identifying

{\displaystyle h}
and

{\displaystyle \alpha }
that result in zero net force and zero net torque for a given

{\displaystyle \rho _{s}}
