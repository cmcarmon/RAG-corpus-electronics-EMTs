3.5 S U P E R P O S I T I O N
Suppose we make the circuit in Figure 3.12 one step more complicated by
adding a third source, as shown in Figure 3.33. Straightforward node analysis
following the procedure outlined by the node method yields
(V1 − e1)G1 + (V2 − e1)G2 + (e2 − e1)G3 = 0
(e1 − e2)G3 − e2G4 + I = 0.
