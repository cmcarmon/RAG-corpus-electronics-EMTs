The simplest form of analog communication is baseband communication.
Point of Interest: We use analog communication techniques for analog message signals, like
music, speech, and television. Transmission and reception of analog signals using analog results
in an inherently noisy received signal (assuming the channel adds noise, which it almost certainly
does).
