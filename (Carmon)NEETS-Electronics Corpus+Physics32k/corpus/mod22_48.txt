Meanwhile, at the University of Pennsylvania, a second system was being developed. This system, 
completed in 1946, was named ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer). ENIAC 
employed 18,000 vacuum tubes in its circuitry; and in spite of these bulky, hot tubes, it worked quite 
successfully. The first problem assigned to ENIAC was a calculation in nuclear physics that would have 
taken 100 human-years to solve by conventional methods. The ENIAC solved the problem in 2 weeks, 
only 2 hours of which were actually spent on the calculation. The remainder of the time was spent 
checking the results and operational details. All modern computers have their basics in these two early 
developments conducted at Harvard University and University of Pennsylvania.
