A simple way to visualize the conduction mechanism of BJT is to consider the 
electrons introduced into the thin base region as effectively changing base material from 
P-type to N-type. Therefore, the transistor structure changes from the non-conductive N-
P-N layers to the conductive N-N-N layers.
