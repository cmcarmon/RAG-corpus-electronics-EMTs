flowfield must contain molecular species with an optical resonance wavelength that can be accessed by laser
temperature measurements typically require two laser sources
velocity measurements typically practical only for high Mach number flows (near sonic or supersonic)
signal-to-noise ratio often limited by detector shot-noise
fluorescence interferences from other species, especially from hydrocarbons in high pressure reacting flows
attenuation of laser sheet across flow field or reabsorption of fluorescence before it reaches detector can lead to systematic errors
