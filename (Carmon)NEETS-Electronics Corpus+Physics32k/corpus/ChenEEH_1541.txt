To use MS-DOS, you just turn on the computer. A few
seconds later, the shell prompt appears. Unless the PC hard-
ware itself has a security protection set up, there is no login
procedure and no password because MS-DOS is really meant
for a personal computer. The underlying assumption is that
the machine is used by only one person. For the same reason,
Ô¨Åles and directories do not have owners, and there are no
protection bits. There is also no concept of a superuser. The
regular user can do everything.
