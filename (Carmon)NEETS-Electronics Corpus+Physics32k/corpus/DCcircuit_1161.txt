For some high-current applications, conductor sizes beyond the practical size limit of round
wire are required. In these instances, thick bars of solid metal called busbars are used as
conductors. Busbars are usually made of copper or aluminum, and are most often uninsulated.
They are physically supported away from whatever framework or structure is holding them
by insulator standoff mounts. Although a square or rectangular cross-section is very common
for busbar shape, other shapes are used as well. Cross-sectional area for busbars is typically
rated in terms of circular mils (even for square and rectangular bars!), most likely for the
convenience of being able to directly equate busbar size with round wire.
