A general procedure for the frequency domain identiﬁcation of
multiple inputs/multiple outputs (MIMO) linear time invari-
ant systems is illustrated in Figure 6.1. Typically, one starts
with the experimental frequency response function (FRF) of
the test system. These FRF data may either be computed from
the saved input/output measurement data or measured dir-
ectly online by a spectrum analyzer. Based on these data, the
matrix fraction (MF) or the polynomial matrix (PM) curve-
ﬁtting technique is applied to ﬁnd a transfer function matrix
(TFM) that closely ﬁts into the FRF data. Detailed algorithms
for the curve-ﬁtting are introduced in Section 6.2. Frequently,
for the purposes of simulation and control, one needs a state-
space realization of the system. This may be achieved by
various linear system realization algorithms. In particular,
the eigensystem realization algorithm (ERA) is presented in
Section 6.3 for this purpose, thanks to its many successes in
previous application studies. The Markov parameters, based
on the parameters from which the state-space model will be
derived, can be easily generated from the identiﬁed transfer
function matrix. Finally, as a measure of performance, the
model FRF is computed and is compared to the experimental
FRF. This is illustrated in Section 6.4 by means of two experi-
mental application examples.
