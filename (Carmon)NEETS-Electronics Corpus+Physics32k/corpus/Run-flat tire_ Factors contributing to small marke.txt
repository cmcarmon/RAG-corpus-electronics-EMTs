Besides the cost, which can be more than double other tires of comparable size, run-flat tires can not be run flat if the flat is due to sidewall damage, a common cause of flats. Also, under the best circumstances, the speed and range that the run-flat tires can be run flat is very limited. Run-flat tires cannot be driven over 50 miles per hour and usually offer only up to 50 miles of extended mobility. These limitations lower the value of the extra expense for many buyers. In certain applications, depending on the vehicle, specific tire design, and driving surface, a run-flat tire can provide from 25 miles to 200 miles driving while flat with limited speed.
