{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =-{\frac {GMm}{r^{3}}}\mathbf {r} ,}

where r is the position vector from the object with mass M to the object with mass m, and G is the gravitational constant.
This can also be expressed as

is a vector of length 1 pointing from M to m.
Let the mass m move at the velocity v then the work of gravity on this mass as it moves from position r(t1) to r(t2) is given by
