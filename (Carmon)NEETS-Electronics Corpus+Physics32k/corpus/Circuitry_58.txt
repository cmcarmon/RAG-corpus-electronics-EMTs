Example 1.25 
 
Estimate the relative permeability of cast steel (see 
Fig.  1.18)  at  (a)  a  flux  density  of  0.6  T  and  (b)  a 
flux density of 1.6 T. 
 
Solution 
 
From Fig. 1.18, the slope of the graph at any point 
gives  the  value  of  Âµ at  that  point.  We  can  easily 
find the slope by constructing a tangent at the point 
in  question  and  then  finding  the  ratio  of  vertical 
change to horizontal change. 
 
(a)   The slope of the graph at 0.6 T is 0.6/800
