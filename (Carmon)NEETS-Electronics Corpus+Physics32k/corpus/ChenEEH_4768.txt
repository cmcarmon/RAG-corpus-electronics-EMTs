Next, with the purpose of improving the controller’s per-
formance, we follow the guidelines given in subsection 12.2.2
and change the design constants in the following manner: we
¼ 1:5,
let k1 ¼ 1, k2 ¼ 3, k3 ¼ 2:5, gaj
¼ 0:4, j ¼ 1, . . ., 7. Notice that
saj
we have chosen larger constants ki as well as larger gai
j, which
we expect should help reduce the size of Wd. At the same
time, we have set the ratios between sa j
and their respective
gaj
to be less than or equal to one, which was not the case in
the ﬁrst design.
