where s(r0) is the surface charge density on the metallic
surface, G(r, r0) is the Greenâ€™s function or the point source
response, S is the surface of the metallic object, and f(r) is
the potential generated by the surface charge. On the
metallic surface S, f(r) must be a constant. As a consequence,
one has:
