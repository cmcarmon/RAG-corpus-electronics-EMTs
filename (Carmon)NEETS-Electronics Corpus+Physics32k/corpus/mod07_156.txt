The ratings of a diode (as stated earlier) are the limiting values of operating conditions, which if
exceeded could cause damage to a diode by either voltage breakdown or overheating. The PN junction
diodes are generally rated for: MAXIMUM AVERAGE FORWARD CURRENT, PEAK RECURRENT
FORWARD CURRENT, MAXIMUM SURGE CURRENT, and PEAK REVERSE VOLTAGE.
