As one final observation on the various models, notice in Figure 7.13 the
discontinuity in the iDS versus vDS curve according to the SR model in the
triode region, and the SCS model in the saturation region. In other words, if a
MOSFET operates in a circuit such that vDS = vGS âˆ’ VT, the two models will
give very different results. We can live with this discontinuity provided we do not
attempt to reconcile the results from the two models in the same analysis.2 You
must choose between the two models depending on the particular situation.
Specifically, use the SR model when operating with a fixed vGS in the triode
region, and use the SCS model when operating in the saturation region. The
SR model is appropriate for use in our digital circuits because of the inverting
property of the type of digital circuits discussed here (for example, our familiar
inverter). Since the drain voltage in our digital circuits is low when the gate
voltage is high, the triode region of MOSFET operation applies, and therefore,
the SR model is appropriate. Conversely, in the design of amplifiers, we will
establish the saturation discipline, which will constrain amplifier designs to
operate MOSFETs exclusively in their saturation region, thereby allowing the
use of the SCS model.
