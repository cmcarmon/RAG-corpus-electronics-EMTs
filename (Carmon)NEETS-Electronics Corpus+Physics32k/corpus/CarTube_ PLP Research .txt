CarTube is part of PLP’s research arm, an in-house group that supports the practice’s design teams and acts as an independent think tank. Recent research projects include:
The Edge, completed in 2015. The Edge is, according to BREEAM, the most sustainable office building in the world, and, according to Bloomberg, the world’s smartest building.
Timber Tower, a project developed with Cambridge University for an all-timber residential high-rise. This 300 meter tower employs a structural system poised to fundamentally transform our relationship with nature in the city.
SkyPod, a new vertical transportation concept, which will revolutionise skyscraper design, reducing the need for space-inefficient elevator shafts.
