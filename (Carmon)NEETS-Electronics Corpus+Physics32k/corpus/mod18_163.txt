Some radar systems are designed for specific functions that do not precisely fit into either of the
above categories. The radar speed gun is an example of radar designed specifically to measure the speed
of a target. The military uses much more complex radar systems that are adapted to detect only fast-
moving targets such as aircraft. Since aircraft usually move much faster than weather or surface targets,
velocity-sensitive radar can eliminate unwanted clutter from the radar indicator. Radar systems that detect
and process only moving targets are called MOVING-TARGET INDICATORS (mti) and are usually
combined with conventional search radar.
