There is a natural double cover of the Olshanski semigroup H, and its closure





H
¯




{\displaystyle {\overline {H}}}
that extends the double cover of SU(1,1) corresponding to the metaplectic group. It is given by pairs (g, γ) where g is an element of H or its closure






g
=


(



a


b




c


d



)






{\displaystyle \displaystyle {g={\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{pmatrix}}}}

and γ is a square root of a.
Such a choice determines a unique branch of

for u in C2.
An element g of the complexification SL(2,C) is said to implementable if there is a bounded operator T such that it and its adjoint leave the space of entire vectors for W invariant, both have dense images and satisfy the covariance relations

{\displaystyle \displaystyle {TW(u)=W(g\cdot u)T,\,\,\,T^{*}W(u)=W(g^{\dagger }\cdot u)T^{*}}}

for u in C2. The implementing operator T is uniquely determined up to multiplication by a non-zero scalar.
The implementable elements form a semigroup, containing SL(2,R). Since the representation has positive energy, the bounded compact self-adjoint operators

{\displaystyle \displaystyle {S_{0}(t)=e^{-tL_{0}}}}

for t > 0 implement the group elements in exp C1.
It follows that all elements of the Olshanski semigroup and its closure are implemented.
Maximality of the Olshanki semigroup implies that no other elements of SL(2,C) are implemented. Indeed, otherwise every element of SL(2,C) would be implemented by a bounded operator, which would condradict the non-invertibility of the operators S0(t) for t > 0.
In the Schrödinger representation the operators S0(t) for t > 0 are given by Mehler's formula. They are contraction operators, positive and in every Schatten class. Moreover, they leave invariant each of the Sobolev spaces. The same formula is true for



ℜ

t
>
0


{\displaystyle \Re \,t>0}
by analytic continuation.
It can be seen directly in the Fock model that the implementing operators can be chosen so that they define an ordinary representation of the double cover of H constructed above. The corresponding semigroup of contraction operators is called the oscillator semigroup. The extended oscillator semigroup is obtained by taking the semidirect product with the operators W(u). These operators lie in every Schatten class and leave invariant the Sobolev spaces and the space of entire vectors for W.
The decomposition








H
¯


=
G
⋅
exp
⁡


C
¯






{\displaystyle \displaystyle {{\overline {H}}=G\cdot \exp {\overline {C}}}}

corresponds at the operator level to the polar decomposition of bounded operators.
Moreover, since any matrix in H is conjugate to a diagonal matrix by elements in H or H−1, every operator in the oscillator semigroup is quasi-similar to an operator S0(t) with



ℜ
t
>
0


{\displaystyle \Re t>0}
. In particular it has the same spectrum consisting of simple eigenvalues.
In the Fock model, if the element g of the Olshanki semigroup H corresponds to the matrix

Operators in the extended oscillator semigroup are given by similar expressions with additional linear terms in z and w appearing in the exponential.

It is also possible to give an explicit formula for the contraction operators corresponding to g in H in the Schrödinger representation, It was by this formula that Howe (1988) introduced the oscillator semigroup as an explicit family of operators on L2(R).
In fact consider the Siegel upper half plane consisting of symmetric complex 2x2 matrices with positive definite real part:






Z

{\displaystyle \displaystyle {Z={\begin{pmatrix}A&B\\B&D\end{pmatrix}}}}

Moreover, SZ is a strict contraction:
