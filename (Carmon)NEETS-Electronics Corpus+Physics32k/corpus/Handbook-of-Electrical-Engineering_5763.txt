3. Extend bifurcation subsystem analysis to the differential algebraic model and link the bifurcation sub-
system  in  a  differential  algebraic  model,  to  those  obtained  in  the  loadï¬‚ow  model.  The  bifurcation
subsystems for different Hopf and saddle node bifurcations can explain why the subsystem experiences
instability, as well as how to prevent instability as has been possible for bifurcation subsystems in the
algebraic model. Knowledge of bifurcation subsystems in the algebraic model may assist in identifying
bifurcation subsystems in the differential algebraic model.
