To find the solution for the flow of a laminar layer through a tube, we need to make one last assumption. There is no acceleration of liquid in the pipe, and by Newton's first law, there is no net force. If there is no net force then we can add all of the forces together to get zero

First, to get everything happening at the same point, use the first two terms of a Taylor series expansion of the velocity gradient:

{\displaystyle \left.{\frac {dv}{dr}}\right|_{r+dr}=\left.{\frac {dv}{dr}}\right|_{r}+\left.{\frac {d^{2}v}{dr^{2}}}\right|_{r}\,dr.}

The expression is valid for all laminae. Grouping like terms and dropping the vertical bar since all derivatives are assumed to be at radius r,

Finally, put this expression in the form of a differential equation, dropping the term quadratic in dr.

{\displaystyle -{\frac {1}{\mu }}{\frac {\Delta P}{\Delta x}}={\frac {d^{2}v}{dr^{2}}}+{\frac {1}{r}}{\frac {dv}{dr}}}

It can be seen that both sides of the equations are negative: there is a drop of pressure along the tube (left side) and both first and second derivatives of the velocity are negative (velocity has a maximum value at the center of the tube, where r = 0). Using the product rule, the equation may be rearranged to:

{\displaystyle -{\frac {1}{\mu }}{\frac {\Delta P}{\Delta x}}={\frac {1}{r}}{\frac {d}{dr}}\left(r{\frac {dv}{dr}}\right).}

The right-hand side is the radial term of the Laplace operator ∇2, so this differential equation is a special case of the Poisson equation. It is subject to the following boundary conditions:

Axial symmetry means that the velocity v(r) is maximum at the center of the tube, therefore the first derivative dv/dr is zero at r = 0.
The differential equation can be integrated to:

{\displaystyle v(r)=-{\frac {1}{4\mu }}r^{2}{\frac {\Delta P}{\Delta x}}+A\ln(r)+B.}

To find A and B, we use the boundary conditions.
First, the symmetry boundary condition indicates:

{\displaystyle {\frac {dv}{dr}}=-{\frac {1}{2\mu }}r{\frac {\Delta P}{\Delta x}}+{\frac {A}{r}}=0\quad {\mbox{ at }}r=0.}

A solution possible only if A = 0. Next the no-slip boundary condition is applied to the remaining equation:

{\displaystyle B={\frac {1}{4\mu }}R^{2}{\frac {\Delta P}{\Delta x}}.}
