Some multimeter models don’t have a dedicated on/off switch; instead, the 
function selector knob has an off setting. Make sure you move the knob to 
the off setting after you finish taking measurements so you don’t run down 
the battery. If you inserted the red test lead into a different receptacle to 
measure current, be sure to move the lead back to the receptacle that allows 
you to measure voltage and resistance; if you forget to do this, you may 
smoke your meter.
