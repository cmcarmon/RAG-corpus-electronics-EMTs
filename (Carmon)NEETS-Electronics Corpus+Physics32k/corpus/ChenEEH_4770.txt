P
than in the ﬁrst design; this results from the fact that the L2
i and not of
bound in subsection 12.2.2 is a measure of
i . This means that the only conclusion one can reach
for sure is that x1 will have a smaller bound in the second
design. However, observe in Figure 12.5 the plots of
i (t )
for both designs. The solid line, corresponding to the ﬁrst
design, is always above the dashed line, which corresponds to
the second design, as expected.
