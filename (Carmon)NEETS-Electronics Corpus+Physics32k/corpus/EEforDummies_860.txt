In this chapter, I give you guidelines for setting up 
a little electronics laboratory in your own home. I 
outline the tools and supplies you need to accom-
plish circuit‚Äêbuilding jobs, and I give you a shop-
ping list of electronic components to purchase so 
you can build a bunch of different projects.
