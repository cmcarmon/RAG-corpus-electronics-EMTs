stack instructions allow the storage and retrieval 
of different microprocessor registers in the stack. 
The stack is a temporary memory location that is used 
for storing the contents of the program counter dur-
ing a jump to a subroutine program. The difference 
between a stack and other forms of memory is the 
method in which the data is accessed or addressed. A 
push instruction stores the register content, and a pull 
instruction retrieves the register content. There is an 
advantage with the stack because data can be stored 
into it or read from it with single-byte instructions. All 
data transfers are between the top of the stack and the 
accumulator. That is, the accumulator communicates 
only with the top location of the stack.
