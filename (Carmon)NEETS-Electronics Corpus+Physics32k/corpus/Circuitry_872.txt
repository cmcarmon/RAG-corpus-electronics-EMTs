and  the  PCB  itself  (where  copper  pads  and  tracks 
might lift due to the application of excessive heat). 
 
General-purpose solder 
 
A high melting point temperature (typically 255Â°C) 
designed  for  general  electrical  repair  work  (and 
unsuitable for use with electronic equipment). 
 
Silver bearing solders 
 
Silver bearing solders tend to flow more smoothly 
and  form  stronger 
they 
generally require higher soldering and desoldering 
temperatures  and 
this  can  make  component 
removal and replacement difficult. In particular, the 
higher temperatures involved may cause damage to 
the  bond  between  copper  pads  and  tracks  and  the 
printed circuit substrate on which they are formed. 
In  turn,  this  can  result  in  the  lifting  of  pads  and 
tracks and permanent damage can result. 
 
Flux 
 
Flux has two roles in soldering. Firstly it helps with 
the  removal  of  any  oxide  coating  that  may  have 
formed on the surfaces that are to be soldered and 
secondly it helps to prevent the formation of oxides 
caused  by  the  heat  generated  during  the  soldering 
process  itself.  Flux  is  available  in  both  paste  and 
liquid  form.  However,  in  the  case  of  solder  for 
electronic  applications, 
is  also  available 
incorporated  within  the  solder  itself.  In  this  case, 
the flux is contained within a number of cores that 
permeate through the solder material rather like the 
letters  that  appear  on  a  piece  of  souvenir  seaside 
rock.
