There is, however, one remaining problem with our memory element
circuit. Recall that the static discipline required that our digital circuit elements
such as gates be restoring. In other words, in order to obtain positive noise
margins, the voltage threshold requirements on the outputs of gates was more
stringent than those on the inputs. For example, the static discipline required
that a VIH input to a gate be restored to VOH at the output, where VOH > VIH
for a positive noise margin. In order to inter-operate digital memory elements
with our digital gates, we require that our digital memory elements satisfy the
same set of voltage thresholds.
