Second derivatives of thermodynamic potentials generally describe the response of the system to small changes. The number of second derivatives which are independent of each other is relatively small, which means that most material properties can be described in terms of just a few "standard" properties. For the case of a single component system, there are three properties generally considered "standard" from which all others may be derived:
Compressibility at constant temperature or constant entropy

These properties are seen to be the three possible second derivative of the Gibbs free energy with respect to temperature and pressure.
