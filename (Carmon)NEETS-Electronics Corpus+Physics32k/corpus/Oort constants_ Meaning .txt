The Oort constants can greatly enlighten one as to how the Galaxy rotates. As one can see



A


{\displaystyle A}
and



B


{\displaystyle B}
are both functions of the Sun's orbital velocity as well as the first derivative of the Sun's velocity. As a result,



A


{\displaystyle A}
describes the shearing motion in the disk surrounding the Sun, while



B


{\displaystyle B}
describes the angular momentum gradient in the solar neighborhood, also referred to as vorticity.
To illuminate this point, one can look at three examples that describe how stars and gas orbit within the Galaxy giving intuition as to the meaning of



A


{\displaystyle A}
and



B


{\displaystyle B}
. These three examples are solid body rotation, Keplerian rotation and constant rotation over different annuli. These three types of rotation are plotted as a function of radius (



R


{\displaystyle R}
), and are shown in Figure 3 as the green, blue and red curves respectively. The grey curve is approximately the rotation curve of the Milky Way.
