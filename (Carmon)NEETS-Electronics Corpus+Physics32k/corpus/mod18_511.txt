The dew point (related to moisture content) and the flow of the lp dry air can be monitored at the air 
control panel. Also, the dry-air pressure can be monitored at the input to the control panel, at the input to 
the flowmeter (in which accuracy is calibrated at a certain pressure), and at the output of the control 
panel. A filter is installed to trap particles that affect proper pressure regulation. A metering valve bypass 
and a pressure relief valve are provided in case of malfunctions. The metering valve bypass permits 
manual control of air pressure to the user equipment.
