By combining (i) the economic theory of rational expectation bubbles, (ii) behavioral finance on imitation and herding of investors and traders and (iii) the mathematical and statistical physics of bifurcations and phase transitions, he has pioneered the log-periodic power law singularity (LPPLS) model of financial bubbles. The LPPLS model considers the faster-than-exponential (power law with finite-time singularity) increase in asset prices decorated by accelerating oscillations as the main diagnostic of bubbles. It embodies the effect of positive feedback loops of higher return anticipations competing with negative feedback spirals of crash expectations. The LPPLS model was first proposed in 1995 to predict the failure of critical pressure tanks embarked on the European Ariane rocket and as a theoretical formulation of the acceleration moment release to predict earthquakes. The LPPLS model was then proposed to also apply to model financial bubbles and their burst by Sornette, Johansen and Bouchaud  and independently by Feigenbaum and Freund. The formal analogy between mechanical ruptures, earthquakes and financial crashes was further refined within the rational expectation bubble framework of Blanchard and Watson by Johansen, Ledoit and Sornette. This approach is now referred to in the literature as the JLS model. Recently, Sornette has added the S to the LPPL acronym of "log-periodic power law" to make clear that the "power law" part should not be confused with power law distributions: indeed, the "power law" refers to the hyperbolic singularity of the form
