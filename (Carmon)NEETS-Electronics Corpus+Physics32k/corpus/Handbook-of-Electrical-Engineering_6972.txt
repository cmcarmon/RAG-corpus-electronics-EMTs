Popularization  of  the  sampling  theorem  is  credited  to  Shannon  [1948]  who,  in  1948,  used  it  to  show  the
equivalence of the information content of a bandlimited signal and a sequence of discrete numbers. Shannon
was aware of the pioneering work of Whittaker [1915] and Whittaker’s son [1929] in formulating the sampling
theorem. Kotel’nikov’s [1933] independent discovery in the then Soviet Union deserves mention. Higgins [1985]
credits Borel [1897] with ﬁrst recognizing that a signal could be recovered from its samples.
