The ﬁeld conﬁgurations (modes) that can be supported by
such a structure are TE and TM modes along the longitudinal
direction (z-axis in the ﬁgure). Starting from Maxwell’s equa-
tions after proper expansion in cylindrical coordinates and
imposing the boundary conditions, it is possible to obtain
the propagation constant and the ﬁeld distribution for each
TE mode and TM mode in the waveguide. The propagation
constant for the TE modes can be written as a function of the
roots (x0
mn) of the derivative of the Bessel function of the ﬁrst
kind (Balanis, 1989). The result is the following equation:
