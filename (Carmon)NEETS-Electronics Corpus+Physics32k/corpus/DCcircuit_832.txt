However, most potentiometers provide too large a resistance span over their mechanically-
short movement range to allow for precise adjustment. Suppose you desired a resistance of
8.335 kΩ +/- 1 Ω, and wanted to use a 10 kΩ potentiometer (rheostat) to obtain it. A precision
of 1 Ω out of a span of 10 kΩ is 1 part in 10,000, or 1/100 of a percent! Even with a 10-turn
