In quantum mechanics Thomas precession is a correction to the spin-orbit interaction, which takes into account the relativistic time dilation between the electron and the nucleus in hydrogenic atoms.
Basically, it states that spinning objects precess when they accelerate in special relativity because Lorentz boosts do not commute with each other.
To calculate the spin of a particle in a magnetic field, one must also take into account Larmor precession.
