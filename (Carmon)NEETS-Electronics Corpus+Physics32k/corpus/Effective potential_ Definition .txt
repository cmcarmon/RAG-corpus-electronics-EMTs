The effective potential




U

eff




{\displaystyle U_{\text{eff}}}
is defined in the following way:





U

U
(

r

)


{\displaystyle U_{\text{eff}}(\mathbf {r} )={\frac {L^{2}}{2\mu r^{2}}}+U(\mathbf {r} )}

L is the angular momentum
r is the distance between the two masses
μ is the reduced mass of the two bodies (approximately equal to the mass of the orbiting body if one mass is much larger than the other)
U(r) is the general form of the potential
The effective force, then, is the negative gradient of the effective potential:

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\mathbf {F} _{\text{eff}}&=-\nabla U_{\text{eff}}(\mathbf {r} )\\&={\frac {L^{2}}{\mu r^{3}}}{\hat {\mathbf {r} }}-\nabla U(\mathbf {r} )\end{aligned}}}

Where

{\displaystyle {\hat {\mathbf {r} }}}
denotes a unit vector in the radial direction.
