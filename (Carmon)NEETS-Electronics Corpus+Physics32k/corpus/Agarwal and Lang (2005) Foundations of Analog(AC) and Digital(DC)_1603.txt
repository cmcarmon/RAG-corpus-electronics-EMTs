We are now ready to determine the instantaneous power dissipated in the
circuit when the switch is closed. In general, we cannot use the Th√©venin equiv-
alent circuit to determine the power consumed in the original circuit because the
power computation is a nonlinear process. Therefore, returning to the circuit in
Figure 11.3, the instantaneous power dissipated by the circuit when the switch
is closed is given by the sum of the power dissipated in resistors R1 and R2.
