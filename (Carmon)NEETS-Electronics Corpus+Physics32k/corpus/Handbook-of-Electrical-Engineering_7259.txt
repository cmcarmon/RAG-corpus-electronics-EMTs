Coverage Area
To satisfy the majority of requirements, we determined that approximately 70% of LANs would be deployed
in areas of less than 5000 ft2 (see Fig. 75.7). This must take into consideration the fairly dense environment,
made up of cubicles and apportioned hallway space. The market investigations indicated that a wireless offering
must accommodate, at the least, 150 ft2 per user. This is equivalent to 32 users/system in a 5,000 ft2 area.
