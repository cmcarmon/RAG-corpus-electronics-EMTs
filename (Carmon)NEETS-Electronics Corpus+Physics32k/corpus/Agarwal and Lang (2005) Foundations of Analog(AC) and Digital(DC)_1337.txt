To begin, we find the charge on each capacitor before the switch closes. Using Equation
9.8, Q1 = 10 µC and Q2 = 10 µC. Next, use Equations 9.102 and 9.103 to determine
that q1 = 20/11 µC and q2 = 200/11 µC after the switch closes. Equation 9.103 or
9.104 can then be used to determine that v1 = v2 = 20/11 V after the switch closes.
Finally, Equations 9.106 and 9.108 are used to determine that the initial stored energy
is 55 µJ, and that the energy lost is approximately 36.8 µJ.
