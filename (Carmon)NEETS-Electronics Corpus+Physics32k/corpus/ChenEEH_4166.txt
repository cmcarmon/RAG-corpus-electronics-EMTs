Bit Rate Per Second Versus Baud Rate
Many people use bit rate per second (bps) and baud rate
interchangeably, which is not correct. The bps is deﬁned as the
number of binary bits transmitted per second, while Baud rate
is deﬁned as the number of signal elements or states transmit-
ted per second. Frequency, amplitude, or phase can be con-
sidered as signaling elements. If a modem only uses two
frequencies signaling elements in the transmission, the baud
rate of the modem is equal to bps, where the higher frequency
can represent a binary 1 and a lower frequency can represent a
binary 0. If a modem uses four frequencies to represent signal-
ing elements, then each frequency can represent two binary
bits. For example, 00 corresponds to the ﬁrst frequency, 01
corresponds to the second frequency, 10 corresponds to the
third frequency, and 11 corresponds to the last frequency. In
this case, a baud rate is equal to 2 bps.
