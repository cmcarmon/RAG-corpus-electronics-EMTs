First of all, deﬁne node voltages for all nodes in a given circuit. Any node chosen as the reference will
do. For example, in the portion of a large circuit depicted in Figure 3.36, we deﬁne node voltages for nodes
a, b and c. With these node voltages, we can express the voltage across any element in terms of them. For
example, the voltage across element 1 is given by v1 = eb − ea. The instantaneous power for element 1
becomes
