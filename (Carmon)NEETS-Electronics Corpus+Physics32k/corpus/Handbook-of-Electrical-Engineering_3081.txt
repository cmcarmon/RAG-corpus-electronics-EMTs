(f) Second-order bandstop ﬁlters are very useful in rejecting unwanted signals such as line noise or carrier
frequencies  in  instrumentation  applications.  Such  ﬁlters  are  implemented  with  methods  very  similar  to  the
bandpass ﬁlters just discussed. In most cases, the frequency of the zeros is to be the same as the frequency of
the poles. For this application, the circuit shown in Fig. 29.21 can be used.
