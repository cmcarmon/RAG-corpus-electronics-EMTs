In research work presented in this chapter, the online fault
accommodation control problems under various system fail-
ures were investigated. The major interest was focused on
dealing with the unanticipated system failures in the general
formulation. Through discrete-time Lyapunov stability theory,
the necessary and sufﬁcient conditions to guarantee the system
online stability and performance under failures were derived
together with an online fault accommodation control tech-
nique. In general, the effectiveness of the developed online
fault accommodation technique for unanticipated system fail-
ures was demonstrated through the simulation study. Based on
modern intelligent techniques, the unexpected failures could
be identiﬁed and properly accommodated online without the
complete realization of the failure dynamics. The price paid for
this achievement of the successful control mission relies on a
certain degree of computational complexity. Simulation results
indicate that, under the Levenberg-Marquardt training algo-
rithm with Bayesian regularization (Demuth and Beale, 1998;
Mackey, 1992), the online learning of the unanticipated failure
dynamics usually converges within 10 iterations, and the
online simulation speed can reach two to three time-steps
per second under the Intel Pentium II 450 dual processors.
Although this may not be fast enough in many real-time
control systems that require a higher sampling rate,
it is
believed that with the continuous performance improvement
of microprocessors and semiconductor
the
proposed online fault accommodation technique will be
implemented online in most of the real-time control systems
in near future.
