The law itself can be stated as follows:

For a fixed amount of an ideal gas kept at a fixed temperature, pressure and volume are inversely proportional.

Or Boyle's law is a gas law, stating that the pressure and volume of a gas have an inverse relationship, when temperature is held constant. If volume increases, then pressure decreases and vice versa, when temperature is held constant.
Therefore, when the volume is halved, the pressure is doubled; and if the volume is doubled, the pressure is halved.
