Compared to a single trail of meteor scatter, the time of opening caused by a single airplane is longer - it can be from 30 seconds up to a few minutes. Slight asymmetry can sometimes be encountered both in terms of exact timing and the gain of the path.
Range and possible contact lengths are affected by the size of the plane, flight level and the approximate crossing time of the central part of the straight line between the two communicating stations.
Both the onset and decay of the channel is rapid, so to improve success rate, a short contact procedure is used.
Contact opportunities can be predicted based on the precise flight paths of surrounding planes. There exist software solutions for prediction using local (Mode S and ADS-B) or online sources.
Microwave access using high gain antennas needs to consider precise aiming that takes into account elevation angles as well.
