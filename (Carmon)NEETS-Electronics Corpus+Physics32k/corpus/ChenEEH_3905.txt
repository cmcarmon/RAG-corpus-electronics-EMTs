Illustrated here is the content selection in an example multi-
media document, as shown in Figure 5.8. The multimedia
document has two media resources: a video resource ¼ (O00)0
and a text resource ¼ (O20)1. For each media resource (Oij)n,
where n 2 {0, 1}, a variation document {Oij}n can be con-
structed, which gives the different variations of the media re-
source. The selection process selects the variations (O
ij)0 and
(O
ij)1, respectively, to maximize the total content value.
Consider the four variations of each media resource with
content values and data sizes given in Table 5.1. By iterating
over values for the trade-off l in content value and data size,
the content selection table of Table 5.2 is obtained which shows
the media resource variations that maximize the total content
value max (SnV ( (Oij)n)) for different total maximum data
sizes DT , as given in equation 5.1.
