Therefore, to physically reference a record stored using the cylinder method, a computer program 
must specify the cylinder number, the recording surface number, and the record number as shown in 
figure 2-10, view A. Here, the record is stored in cylinder 25 of recording surface 6 and is the first record 
on that track. Special data stored on each track specifies the beginning of the track so that the first record, 
second record, third record, and so on, can be identified.
