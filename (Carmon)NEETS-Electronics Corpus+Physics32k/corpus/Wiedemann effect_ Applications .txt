Magnetostrictive position sensors use the Wiedemann effect to excite an ultrasonic pulse. Typically a small magnet is used to mark a position along a magnetostrictive wire. The magnetic field from a short current pulse in the wire combined with that from the position magnet excites the ultrasonic pulse. The time required for this pulse to travel from the point of excitation to a pickup at the end of the wire gives the position. Reflections from the other end of the wire could lead to disturbances. In order to avoid this the wire is connected to a mechanical damper that end.
