Many  of  todayâ€™s  complex  electronic  systems  are 
based  on 
the  use  of  a  microprocessor  or 
microcontroller.  Such  systems  comprise  hardware 
that is controlled by software. If it is  necessary to 
change  the  way  that  the  system  behaves  it  is  the 
software (rather than the hardware) that is changed.    
 
In  this  chapter  we  provide  an  introduction  to 
microprocessors and explain, in simple terms, both 
how they operate and how they are used. We shall 
start by explaining some of the terminology that is 
used  to  describe  different  types  of  system  that 
involve  the  use  of  a  microprocessor  or  a  similar 
device.
