The electric power system, in very general terms, is made up
of generators, transformers, transmission and distribution
lines, and loads. Although these are called components in
this chapter, each of these is a complex system on its own
and has many components. All of these are three-phase, 60-Hz
components except for the smallest loads, such as residences,
where the three phases are split into single-phase, low-voltage
supply.
