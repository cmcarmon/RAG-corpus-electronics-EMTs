Step 2 labels the potentials of the remaining with respect to the ground node. Figure 3.14
shows such a labeling. Since Node 2 is connected to the ground node through an
independent voltage source, it is labeled with the voltage of the source, namely 1 V.
Node 3 is labeled with a node voltage e1 and Node 4 is labeled with a node voltage e2.
