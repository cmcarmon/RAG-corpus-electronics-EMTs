Level 5 adds primitive processes that are single programs in
the course of execution. The information required to represent
a primitive process is its state word, which consists of the
values of the registers in a processor. This level also provides
a context switch operation, which transfers a processor’s atten-
tion from one process to another by saving the state word of
the ﬁrst and loading the state word of the second. All processes
ready to run are queued in a ready list. After a process is
switched off its processor, a scheduler in this level selects the
next process from the ready list to run. This level also provides
semaphores, the special variables used to cause one process to
stop and wait until another process has signaled the comple-
tion of a task.
