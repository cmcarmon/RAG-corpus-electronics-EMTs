Dissolution of sucrose and other sugars in water changes not only its specific gravity but its optical properties in particular its refractive index and the extent to which it rotates the plane of linearly polarized light. The refractive index, nD, for sucrose solutions of various percentage by mass has been measured and tables of nD vs. °Bx published. As with the hydrometer, it is possible to use these tables to calibrate a refractometer so that it reads directly in °Bx. Calibration is usually based on the ICUMSA tables, but the user of an electronic refractometer should verify this.
