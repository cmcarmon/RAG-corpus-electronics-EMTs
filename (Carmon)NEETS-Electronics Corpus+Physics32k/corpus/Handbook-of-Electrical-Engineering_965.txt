MOS DC Models
Available MOS Models
A number of MOS models have been provided over time with the original circuit simulation program, SPICE.
In addition, some commercially available circuit simulation programs have introduced their own proprietary
models,  most  notably  HSPICE.1  This  section  is  concentrated  on  the  standard  MOS  models  provided  by  UC
Berkeleyâ€™s  SPICE,  not  only  because  they  have  become  the  standard  models  used  by  all  circuit  simulation
programs, but also because the proprietary models provided by commercial vendors are not well documented
and no source code is available for these models to investigate them thoroughly.
