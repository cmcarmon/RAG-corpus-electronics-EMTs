The pulse-modulation method of energy transmission was analyzed to some extent earlier in this
chapter. As the previous discussions indicated, radio-frequency energy can also be transmitted in very
short bursts, called pulses. These pulses are of extremely short time duration, usually on the order of 0.1
microsecond to approximately 50 microseconds. In this method, the transmitter is turned on for a very
short time and the pulse of radio-frequency energy is transmitted, as shown in view A of figure 1-22. The
transmitter is then turned off, and the pulse travels outward from the transmitter at the velocity of light
(view B). When the pulse strikes an object (view C), it is reflected and begins to travel back toward the
radar system, still moving at the same velocity (view D). The pulse is then received by the radar system
(view E). The time interval between transmission and reception is computed and converted into a visual
indication of range in miles or yards. The radar cycle then starts over again by transmitting another pulse
(view F). This method does not depend on the relative frequency of the returned signal or on the motion
of the target; therefore, it has an important advantage over cw and fm methods.
