Zones of Protection
To make sure that a protection system removes the min-
imum amount of equipment from the power system dur-
ing its operation, the power system is divided into zones
of  protection.  Each  zone  has  its  associated  protection
system. A fault inside the zone causes the associated pro-
tection system to operate. A fault in any other zone must
not  cause  an  operation.  A  zone  of  protection  usually
covers  one  piece  of  equipment,  such  as  a  transmission
line.  The  zone  boundary  is  deﬁned  by  the  location  of
transducers  (usually  current  transformers)  and  also  by
circuit breakers that will operate to isolate the zone. A set of zones of protection is shown in Fig. 61.40. Note
that all zones are shown to overlap with their neighbors. This is to ensure that no point on the system is left
unprotected. Occasionally, a circuit breaker may not exist at a zone boundary. In such cases, the tripping must
be done at some other remote circuit breakers. For example, consider protection zone A in Fig. 61.40. A fault
in that zone must be isolated by tripping circuit breakers X and Y. While the breaker X is near the transformer
and can be tripped locally, Y is remote from the station, and some form of communication channel must be
used  to  transfer  the  trip  command  to Y. Although  most  zones  of  protection  have  a  precise  extent,  there  are
some zones that have a loosely deﬁned reach. These are known as open zones and are most often encountered
in transmission line protection.
