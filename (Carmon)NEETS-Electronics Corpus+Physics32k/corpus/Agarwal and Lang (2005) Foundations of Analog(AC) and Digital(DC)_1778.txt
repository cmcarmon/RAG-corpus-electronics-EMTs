long periods of time, the circuit states will have settled to vC = 0.5 V and iL = 0
prior to the transient. These are then the initial states for the rising transient. Again for
simplicity, we will assume that the rising transient begins at t = 0. Therefore, the varying
component of the circuit states begin a rising transient from
