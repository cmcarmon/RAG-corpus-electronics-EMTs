In 1662 Robert Boyle studied the relationship between volume and pressure of a gas at constant temperature. He observed that volume of a given mass of a gas is inversely proportional to its pressure provided the temperature remains constant. Boyle's law, published in 1662, states that, at constant temperature, the product of the pressure and volume of a given mass of an ideal gas in a closed system is always constant. It can be verified experimentally using a pressure gauge and a variable volume container. It can also be derived from the kinetic theory of gases: if a container, with a fixed number of molecules inside, is reduced in volume, more molecules will strike a given area of the sides of the container per unit time, causing a greater pressure.
A statement of Boyle 's law is as follows:
The volume of a given mass of a gas is inversely related to the pressure exerted on it at a given temperature and given number of moles.
The concept can be represented with these formulae:




V
∝


1
P




{\displaystyle V\propto {\frac {1}{P}}}
, meaning 'Volume is directly proportional to 1 divided by Pressure', or




P
∝


1
V




{\displaystyle P\propto {\frac {1}{V}}}
, meaning 'Pressure is directly proportional to 1 divided by Volume,' or




P

=

k

{\displaystyle PV=k_{1}}
, or





P

V

=

P

2



V

2





{\displaystyle P_{1}V_{1}=P_{2}V_{2}\,}

where P is the pressure, and V is the volume of a gas, and k1 is the constant in this equation (and is not the same as the proportionality constants in the other equations below).
