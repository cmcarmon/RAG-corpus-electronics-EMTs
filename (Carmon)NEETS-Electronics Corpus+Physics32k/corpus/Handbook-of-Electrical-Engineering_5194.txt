Electromagnetic smart materials: Materials such as shielding materials, radar-absorbing materials (RAMs),
and electromagnetic surface materials, in all of which some electromagnetic properties can be adaptively
controlled by means of an external stimulus dictated by the sensed electromagnetic response.
