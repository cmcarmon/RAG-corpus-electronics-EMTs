dipole. The former type of reference aerial is only 
a theoretical  structure (it is assumed  to produce a 
truly  spherical  radiation  pattern  and  thus  could 
only  be  realized  in  three-dimensional  space  well 
away from the earth). The latter type of aerial is a 
more practical reference since it is reasonably easy 
to  produce  a  half-wave  dipole  for  comparison 
purposes.
