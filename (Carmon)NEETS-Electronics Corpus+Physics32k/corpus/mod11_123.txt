The gain of an amplifier can be expressed in bels by dividing the output (P1) by the input (P2) and 
taking the base 10 logarithm of the resulting quotient. Thus, if an amplifier doubles the power, the 
quotient will be 2. If you consult a logarithm table, you will find that the base 10 logarithm of 2 is 0.3; so 
the power gain of the amplifier is 0.3 bel. Experience has taught that because the bel is a rather large unit, 
it is difficult to apply. A more practical unit that can be applied more easily is the decibel (1/10 bel). Any 
figure expressed in bels can easily be converted to decibels by multiplying the figure by 10 or simply by 
moving the decimal one place to the right. The previously found ratio of 0.3 is therefore equal to 3 
decibels.
