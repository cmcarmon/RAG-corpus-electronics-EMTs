Many electromagnetic wave interaction problems are deﬁned
on ‘‘open’’ regions where the spatial domain is partially or
completely unbounded. Since no computer can store an un-
limited data set, FDTD space lattices for such problems must
somehow be truncated without introducing error due to spu-
rious reﬂection of outward-propagating numerical waves.
Grid truncation conditions of this type are popularly called
absorbing boundary conditions (ABCs) because of their re-
quirement to absorb outward-propagating numerical modes
with negligible reﬂection.
