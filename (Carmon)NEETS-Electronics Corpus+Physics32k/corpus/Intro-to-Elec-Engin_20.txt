An understanding of the principles of energy conversion, electric machines, and energy
systems is important for all in order to solve the problems of energy, pollution, and poverty that
face humanity today. It can be well argued that today’s non-EEs are more likely to encounter
electromechanical machines than some of the ECEs. Thus, it becomes essential to have sufﬁcient
breadth and depth in the study of electric machines by the non-ECEs.
