Similarly, the biological system can affect the performance of the sensor. The foreign body reaction might
cause the host to attempt to break down the materials of the sensor as a way to remove it. This may, in fact,
degrade the sensor package so that the sensor can no longer perform in an adequate manner. Even if the foreign
body reaction is not strong enough to affect the measurement, just the fact that the sensor is placed in a warm,
aqueous environment may cause water to eventually invade the package and degrade the function of the sensor.
Finally, as will be described below, sensors that are implanted in the body are not accessible for calibration.
