Born in Milan, Ohio, the youngest of seven children, Edison received
only three months of formal education because he hated school. He was
home-schooled by his mother and quickly began to read on his own. In
1868,  Edison  read  one  of  Faraday’s  books  and  found  his  calling.  He
moved to Menlo Park, New Jersey, in 1876, where he managed a well-
staffed  research  laboratory.  Most  of  his  inventions  came  out  of  this
laboratory. His laboratory served as a model for modern research organ-
izations.  Because  of  his  diverse  interests  and  the  overwhelming  number
of  his  inventions  and  patents,  Edison  began  to  establish  manufacturing
companies for making the devices he invented. He designed the ﬁrst elec-
tric  power  station  to  supply  electric  light.  Formal  electrical  engineering
education began in the mid-1880s with Edison as a role model and leader.
