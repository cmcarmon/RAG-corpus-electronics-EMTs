There are different equipment and subsystem classes deÔ¨Åned for the various environments in which they are
to be installed into. Table 40.6 gives the descriptions of the different classes and applicapability in MIL-STD-
461D. If the requirement is applicable, three letters (A, L, S) are assigned in the matrix entry. The letter A means
the equipment must meet the particular requirement. An L means consulting more detail of the requirement
which may have different limits due to type of equipment and installation environment. An S means depending
on  the  procurement  requirement.  From  Table  40.6  RE102,  RS103,  CE102,  CS101,  and  CS114,  segments  are
required  for  all  types  of  equipment  and  platforms.  In  this  Handbook  only  RE102  and  CE102  limits  will  be
described.
