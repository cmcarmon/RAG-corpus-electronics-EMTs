This describes how the rack and snail striking mechanism works. The labels refer to the drawing above.
The release lever (L) holds the rack (M) up when the clock is not striking. On the shaft of the minute hand (not shown), which rotates once per hour, there is a projection. As the change of the hour approaches, this projection slowly lifts the release lever, allowing the rack to fall until its point rests on the snail (N). The amount the rack can fall, and thus the number of strikes, is determined by the position of the snail. Exactly on the hour the striking train (G, H, K) is released and begins to turn. As it turns, the pins (G) repeatedly lift the hammer (F) and allow it to drop, ringing the gong (E). The gear ratios are arranged so that the gear wheel (H) makes one revolution each strike. A small pin (S) on this wheel engages the rack teeth, lifting the rack up by one tooth each turn. When the rack reaches the end of its teeth it stops the striking train from turning (using a mechanism not shown in the diagram, in such a way that gear (H) is held stationary with the pin (S) not engaging the rack, so that the rack is able to fall freely again on the next hour). So the number of strikes is equal to the number of teeth of the rack which are used, which depends on the position of the snail.
