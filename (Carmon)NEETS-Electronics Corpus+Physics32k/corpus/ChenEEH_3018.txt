Ô¨Ånite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation and meas-
urement results for the input return loss are shown. The
simulated and measured bandwidths (VSWR < 2) are 43 and
48%, respectively, covering the entire X-band. The antenna is
at least two orders smaller in volume than a standard horn
antenna for the same frequency coverage. The quasi-Yagi an-
tenna can be scaled linearly to any frequency band of interest
while retaining the wideband characteristics. In fact, a C-band
