Architecture
Replacing the ALU and CU (i.e., CPU) of Figure 6.3.1 by a microprocessor, and storing
instructions and data in the same memory, one arrives at a stored-program computer or a
microcomputer. A bus, which is a set of wires carrying address, data, and control signals, is
employed for interconnecting the major components of a microcomputer system. The address lines
are unidirectional signals that specify the address of a memory location of an I/O device. With a
typical 24-bit address bus, the microprocessor can access 224 (over 16 million) memory locations.
Memory is generally organized in blocks of 8, 16, or 32 bits. The data bus is a bidirectional bus,
varying in size from 8 to 32 bits, which carries data between the CPU, MU, and I/O units. The
control bus provides signals to synchronize the memory and I/O operations, select either memory
or an I/O device, and request either the read or the write operation from the device selected.
