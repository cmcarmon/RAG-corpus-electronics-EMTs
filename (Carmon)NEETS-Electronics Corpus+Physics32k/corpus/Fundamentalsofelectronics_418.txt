Properties of the Fourier transform and some useful transform pairs are provided in the accompanying tables
(Table 4.1: Short Table of Fourier Transform Pairs and Table 4.2: Fourier Transform Properties). Especially
important among these properties is Parsevalâ€™s Theorem, which states that power computed in either
