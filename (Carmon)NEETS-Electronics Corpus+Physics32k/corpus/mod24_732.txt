There are several factors that influence the response time of a photodiode and its output circuitry (see
figure 7-3). The most important of these are the thickness of the detector active area and the detector RC
time constant. The detector thickness is related to the amount of time required for the electrons generated
to flow out of the detector active area. This time is referred to as the electron transit time. The thicker the
detector active area, the longer the transit time will be.
