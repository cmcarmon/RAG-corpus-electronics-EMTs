As mentioned, the theory for salient-rotor machines is more com-
plicated. In the equation l2 = Ls ia + Lmib + Lmi c, the terms Ls and Lm
are now dependent on the (relative) position of the rotor. For example
(refer  to  Fig.  66.1),  Ls  is  maximum  when  the  rotor  is  in  a  vertical
position and minimum when the rotor is 90(cid:176) away.
