For the MOSFET circuit shown in Figure 7.65, iDS for both MOSFETs is the same.
Accordingly, we will write expressions for iDS for both MOSFETs, and equate them to
obtain the voltage vO. We are told that MOSFET M1 operates in its saturation region,
and so the saturation region equation applies. Thus for MOSFET M1
