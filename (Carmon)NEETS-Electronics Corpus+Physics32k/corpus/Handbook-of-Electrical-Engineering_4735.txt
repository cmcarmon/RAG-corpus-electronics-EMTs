Here C0 is the capacity that would be measured between the electrodes if there were no mechanical strain on
the piezoelectric, A is the cross-sectional area of the active region, and X is an effective reactance. The quantity
r is the transformer ratio (with dimensions) of an ideal transformer coupling the electrical port to the center
of the acoustic transmission line. K is the electromechanical coupling constant for the material as deﬁned in
Eq. (48.9). The so-called resonant frequency v
0 is that angular frequency at which the length d of the active
0 = pV/d.  In  the  physical  conﬁguration  of  Fig. 48.4(a),  the
region  is  one-half  of  the  stiffened  wavelength,  v
transducer has zero stress on the surfaces of the active region and hence both acoustic ports of Fig. 48.3 are
terminated in short circuits and the line is mechanically resonant at the angular frequency v
0. At this frequency
the  secondary  of  the  transformer  of  Fig. 48.3  is  open  circuited  if  there  are  no  losses,  and  thus  the  electrical
input  impedance  is  inﬁnite  at  this  frequency  and  behaves  like  a  parallel  resonant  circuit  for  neighboring
frequencies. This conﬁguration can be used as a high-Q resonant circuit if the mechanical losses can be kept
low, as they are in single crystals of such piezoelectric materials as quartz. It should be noted, however, that
the behavior is not as simple as that of a simple L-C parallel resonant circuit, primarily because of the frequency
dependence of the effective reactance X and of the transformer ratio in the equivalent circuit. The electrical
input impedance is given by
