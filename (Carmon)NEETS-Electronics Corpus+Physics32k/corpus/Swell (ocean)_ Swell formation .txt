Large breakers one observes on a beach may result from distant weather systems over a fetch of ocean. Five factors influence the formation of wind waves which will go on to become ocean swell:
Wind speed or strength relative to wave speed — the wind must be moving faster than the wave crest for energy transfer, stronger prolonged winds create larger waves
The uninterrupted distance of open water over which the wind blows without significant change in direction (called the fetch)
Width of area affected by fetch
Wind duration — the time over which the wind has blown over a given area
Water depth
All of these factors work together to determine the size of wind waves:
Wave height (from trough to crest)
Wave length (from crest to crest)
Wave period (time interval between arrival of consecutive crests at a stationary point)
Wave propagation direction

A fully developed sea has the maximum wave size theoretically possible for a wind of a specific strength, duration, and fetch. Further exposure to that specific wind could only cause a loss of energy due to the breaking of wave tops and formation of "whitecaps". Waves in a given area typically have a range of heights. For weather reporting and for scientific analysis of wind wave statistics, their characteristic height over a period of time is usually expressed as significant wave height. This figure represents an average height of the highest one-third of the waves in a given time period (usually chosen somewhere in the range from 20 minutes to twelve hours), or in a specific wave or storm system. The significant wave height is also the value a "trained observer" (e.g. from a ship's crew) would estimate from visual observation of a sea state. Given the variability of wave height, the largest individual waves are likely to be somewhat less than twice the reported significant wave height for a particular day or storm.
