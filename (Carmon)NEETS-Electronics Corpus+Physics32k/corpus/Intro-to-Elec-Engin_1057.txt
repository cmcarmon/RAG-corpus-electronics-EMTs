12.1.4 A coil is formed by connecting 15 conducting
loops, or turns, in series. Each loop has length
l = 2.5 m and width w = 10 cm. The 15-turn
coil is rotated at a constant speed of 30 r/s (or
1800 r/min) in a magnetic ﬁeld of density B = 2
T. The conﬁguration of Figure P12.1.3 applies.
(a) Find the induced emf across the coil.
(b) Determine the average power delivered to
the resistor R = 500 , which is connected
between the terminals of the coil.
