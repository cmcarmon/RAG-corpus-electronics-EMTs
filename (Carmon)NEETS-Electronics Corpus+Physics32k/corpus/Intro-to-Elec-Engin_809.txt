Extremely low power consumption and high reliability become important criteria for all
pacemaker designs. While electrical engineers can come up with better circuit designs, mechanical
and chemical engineers have to select better materials to produce the case and the catheter, and
above all, the physicians have to provide the pacemaker speciÔ¨Åcations. Thus, doctors and engineers
have to work in teams in order to develop better biomedical products.
