It  is  possible  to  obtain  somewhat  better  signal-to-noise  ratios  if  one  considers  either  larger  interaction
volumes (assuming electrical phenomena involving the intercell volume), elongated cells, or cells connected by
gap junctions [Polk, 1992]. It is also important to note that in the extremely inhomogeneous biological system,
the  actual  electric  ﬁeld  at  a  particular  point  can  be  considerably  larger  or  smaller  than  its  spatial  average.
Nevertheless very substantial improvement of signal-to-noise ratios would require signal averaging and limi-
tation  of  bandwidth  by  resonance  phenomena  [Weaver  and Astumian,  1990; Adair,  1991]. Weak  steady  and
time-varying magnetic ﬁelds could also be detected above thermal equilibrium noise by ferrimagnetic single-
domain  particles  that  have  recently  been  detected  in  the  human  brain  [Kirschvink  et al.,  1992].  In  addition,
the applicability of Eqs. (113.18) and (113.20) is questionable, because living systems are often far from thermal
equilibrium.  For  example,  only  mitogen-stimulated—and  not  quiescent—lymphocytes  are  affected  by  weak
electric and magnetic ﬁelds [Yost and Liburdy, 1992]. Also, some molecules inside cells may at times be involved
in systematic and guided rather than random thermal motion [Hoffman, 1992].
