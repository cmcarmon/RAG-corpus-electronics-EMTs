Look at the preceding figure. It illustrates a very simple binary counting device. Notice that 12 is
indicated by a lighted lamp and 02 is indicated by an unlighted lamp. The reverse will work equally well.
The unlighted state of the lamp can be used to represent a binary 1 condition, and the lighted state can
represent the binary 0 condition. Both methods are used in digital computer applications. Many other
devices are used to represent binary conditions. They include switches, relays, diodes, transistors, and
integrated circuits (ICs).
