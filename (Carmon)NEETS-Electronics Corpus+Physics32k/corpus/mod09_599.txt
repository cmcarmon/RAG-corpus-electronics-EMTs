Figure 4-27 shows the composition of a peaked wave. Notice how the addition of each odd harmonic 
makes the peak of the resultant higher and the sides steeper. The phase relationship between the 
harmonics of the peaked wave is different from the phase relationship of the harmonics in the 
composition of the square wave. In the composition of the square wave, all the odd harmonics cross the
