The function ej(Vx xþVy y) is a complex sinusoid in two dimen-
sions. It represents a two-dimensional pattern that is sinu-
soidal both along the x (horizontal) and y (vertical) directions.
The Vx and Vy are the spatial
frequencies along the x
and y directions, respectively. An example can be seen in
Figure 4.1, where a two-dimensional sinusoid is depicted as
cos (Vxx þ Vyy), with Vx ¼ 2Vy. One can note that there are
twice as many cycles in the x direction than in the y direction.
The period in the x direction is 2p=Vx and in the y direction is
2p=Vy.
