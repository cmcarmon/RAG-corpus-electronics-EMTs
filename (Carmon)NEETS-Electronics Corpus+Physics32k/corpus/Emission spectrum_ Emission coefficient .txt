Emission coefficient is a coefficient in the power output per unit time of an electromagnetic source, a calculated value in physics. The emission coefficient of a gas varies with the wavelength of the light. It has units of ms−3sr−1. It is also used as a measure of environmental emissions (by mass) per MWh of electricity generated, see: Emission factor.
