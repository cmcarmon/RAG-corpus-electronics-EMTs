Hanjalic (2002) has put together a nice analysis of the shot
boundary detection problem itself, identifying major issues
that need to be considered and creating a conceptual solution
to the problem in the form of a statistical detector based
on minimization of average detection–error probability.
The thresholds used in their system are deﬁned at the lower
level modules of the detector system. The decision making
about the presence of a shot boundary is left solely to a
parameter-free detector, where all of the indications coming
from different low-level modules are combined and evaluated.
Lelescu and Schonfeld (2000, 2003) presented a scene
change detection method using stochastic sequential analysis
theory. The dc data from each frame are processed using
PCA to generate a very low-dimensional feature vector Yk
corresponding to each frame. These feature vectors are as-
sumed to form an independant identically distributed (i.i.d)
sequence of multidimensional random vectors having Gauss-
ian distribution. Scene change is then modeled as change in the
mean parameter of this distribution. Scene change detection is
formulated as a hypothesis testing problem, and the solution is
provided in terms of a threshold on a generalized likelihood
ratio. Scene change is declared at frame k when the maximum
value of the sufﬁcient statistic gk evaluated over frame interval j
to k exceeds the threshold:
