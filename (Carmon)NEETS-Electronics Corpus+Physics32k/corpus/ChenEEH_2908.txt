. Conical scan: In the conical scan mode, an offset antenna
beam is rotated continuously about an axis. The angle
between the axis of rotation and the axis of the beam is
called the squint angle. The echo from a target at the
rotation axis will be constant all along the rotation
period, while the echo from a target off the rotation axis
will be sinusoidally modulated at the rotation frequency.
The amplitude of the modulation indicates how far the
