The positions where a measurement was taken are marked as 0 through 7 on the graph. Note how the 
position of the radius indicates the actual direction from the source at which the measurement was taken. 
This is a distinct advantage over the rectangular-coordinate graph in which the position is indicated along 
a straight-line axis and has no physical relation to the actual direction of measurement. Now that we have 
a way to indicate the direction of measurement, we must devise a way to indicate the magnitude of the 
radiation.
