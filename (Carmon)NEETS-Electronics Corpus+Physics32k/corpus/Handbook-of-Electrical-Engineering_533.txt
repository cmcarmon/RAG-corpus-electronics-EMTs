The  effects  due  to  an  increase  in  the  temperature  in  a  bipolar  diode  are  many.  The  forward  voltage  drop
during conduction will decrease over a large current range, the reverse leakage current will increase, and the
) will increase as the device temperature climbs. A family of static
reverse avalanche breakdown voltage (

characteristic  curves  highlighting  these  effects  is  shown  in  Fig. 5.3  where 
effect on the switching characteristic is the increase in the reverse recovery time during turn-off. Some of the

key parameters to be aware of when choosing a diode are its repetitive peak inverse voltage rating,
