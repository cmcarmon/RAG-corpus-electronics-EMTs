Fault tolerance
the ability of a system to continue correct performance of its tasks after the occurrence of
is simply any physical defect, imperfection, or ﬂaw that occurs in hardware
hardware or software faults. A 
or software. Applications of fault-tolerant computing can be categorized broadly into four primary areas: long-
life, critical computations, maintenance postponement, and high availability. The most common examples of
long-life applications are unmanned space ﬂight and satellites. Examples of critical-computation applications
include aircraft ﬂight control systems, military systems, and certain types of industrial controllers. Maintenance
postponement applications appear most frequently when maintenance operations are extremely costly, incon-
venient, or difﬁcult to perform. Remote processing stations and certain space applications are good examples.
Banking and other time-shared systems are good examples of high-availability applications. Fault tolerance can
be achieved in systems by incorporating various forms of redundancy, including hardware, information, time,
and software redundancy [Johnson, 1989].
