Computers  can  also  be  recording  devices,  digitizing  (converting  to  digital  form)  one  or  several  ampliﬁed
EEG channels at a ﬁxed rate. In such sampled data systems, each channel is repeatedly sampled at a ﬁxed time
interval (sample interval) and this sample is converted into a binary number representation by an A/D converter.
The  A/D  converter  is  interfaced  to  a  computer  system  so  that  each  sample  can  be  saved  in  the  computer’s
memory. A set of such samples, acquired at a sufﬁcient sampling rate (at least two times the highest frequency
component  in  the  sampled  signal),  is  sufﬁcient  to  represent  all  the  information  in  the  waveform.  To  ensure
that the signal is band-limited, a low-pass ﬁlter with a cutoff frequency equal to the highest frequency of interest
is used. Since physically realizable ﬁlters do not have the ideal characteristics, the sampling rate is usually greater
than two times the ﬁlter’s cutoff frequency. Furthermore, once converted to a digital format, digital ﬁltering
techniques can be used.
