Figure 3.3(B) shows the energy band diagram and the charge
distribution for a positive gate bias. To counterbalance the
positive gate charge, the holes under the gate are pushed away,
leaving behind ionized, negatively charged acceptor atoms,
which creates a depletion region. The charge in the depletion
region is exactly equal to the charge on the gate to preserve
charge neutrality. With a positive gate bias, the Fermi level of the
gate is lowered with respect to the Fermi level of the substrate.
The bands bend downward, resulting in a positive surface po-
tential. Under the gate, the valence band moves away from the
Fermi level indicative of hole depletion. When the band bending
at the surface is such that the intrinsic level coincides with the
Fermi level, the surface resembles an intrinsic material. The
surface potential required to have this condition is given by:
