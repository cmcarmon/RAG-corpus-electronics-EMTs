Space research includes the following fields of science:
Earth observations, using remote sensing techniques to interpret optical and radar data from Earth observation satellites
Geodesy, using gravitational perturbations of satellite orbits
Atmospheric sciences, aeronomy using satellites, sounding rockets and high-altitude balloons
Space physics, the in situ study of space plasmas, e.g. aurorae, the ionosphere, the magnetosphere and space weather
Planetology, using space probes to study objects in the planetary system
Astronomy, using space telescopes and detectors that are not limited by looking through the atmosphere
Materials sciences, taking advantage of the micro-g environment on orbital platforms
Life sciences, including human physiology, using the space radiation environment and weightlessness
Physics, using space as a laboratory for studies in fundamental physics.
