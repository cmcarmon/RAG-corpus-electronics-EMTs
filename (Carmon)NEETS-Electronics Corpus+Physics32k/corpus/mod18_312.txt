(spark gaps) connected in a microwave circuit with three terminal transmission lines, one each for the
transmitter, receiver, and antenna. As shown in views A and B of figure 2-12, these circuits may be
connected in parallel or in series. Both systems will be discussed in detail in this section. One tube is
called the TRANSMIT-RECEIVER TUBE, or TR TUBE; the other is called the ANTITRANSMIT-
RECEIVE TUBE, or ATR TUBE. The tr tube has the primary function of disconnecting the receiver, and
the atr tube of disconnecting the transmitter.
