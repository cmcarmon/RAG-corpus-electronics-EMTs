Magnetic disk drive units are storage devices that read and write information on the magnetized 
surfaces of rotating disks (fig. 2-20). The disks are made of thin metal, coated on each side so that data 
can be recorded in the form of magnetized spots. As the disks spin around like music records, characters 
can be stored on them or retrieved in a direct manner. This direct accessing of data has a big advantage 
over the sequential accessing of data. It gives us fast, immediate access to specific data without having to 
examine each and every record from the beginning. You can direct the disk drive to begin reading at any 
point. This is like the phonograph record, you can place the needle at any point and begin playing at any 
point.
