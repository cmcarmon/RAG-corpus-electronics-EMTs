Figure 3-6 shows a simplified two-pole, two-phase alternator. Note that the windings of the two
phases are physically at right angles (90º ) to each other. You would expect the outputs of each phase to
be 90º  apart, which they are. The graph shows the two phases to be 90º  apart, with A leading B. Note
that by using our original definition of phase (from previous modules), we could say that A and B are 90º 
out of phase. There will always be 90º  between the phases of a two-phase alternator. This is by design.
