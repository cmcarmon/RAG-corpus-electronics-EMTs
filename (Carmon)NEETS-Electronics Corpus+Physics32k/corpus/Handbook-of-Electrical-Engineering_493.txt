Thomson Functions
The Thomson function is one in which the time delay of
the network is made maximally ï¬‚at. This implies a linear
phase  characteristic  since  the  steady-state  time  delay  is
the negative of the derivative of the phase. This function
has  excellent  time  domain  characteristics  and  is  used
wherever excellent step response is required. These func-
tions have very little overshoot to a step input and have
far superior settling times compared to the Butterworth
functions.  The  slope  near  cut-off  is  more  gradual  than
the Butterworth. Table 4.2 gives the Thomson denomi-
nator polynomials. The numerator is a constant equal to
the dc gain of the circuit multiplied by the denominator
constant. The cut-off frequencies are not all 1 rad/s. They
are given in Table 4.2.
