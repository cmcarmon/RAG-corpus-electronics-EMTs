The sky wave, often called the ionospheric wave, is radiated in an upward direction and returned to 
Earth at some distant location because of refraction from the ionosphere. This form of propagation is 
relatively unaffected by the Earth's surface and can propagate signals over great distances. Usually the 
high frequency (hf) band is used for sky wave propagation. The following in-depth study of the 
ionosphere and its effect on sky waves will help you to better understand the nature of sky wave 
propagation.
