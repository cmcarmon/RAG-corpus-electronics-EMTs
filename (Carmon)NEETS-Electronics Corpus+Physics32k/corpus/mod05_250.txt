In a three-phase, Y-connected alternator, the total voltage, or line voltage, across any two of the three
line leads is the vector sum of the individual phase voltages. Each line voltage is 1.73 times one of the
phase voltages. Because the windings form only one path for current flow between phases, the line and
phase currents are the same (equal).
