Ernst Heinrich Weber (1795â€“1878) was one of the first people to approach the study of the human response to a physical stimulus in a quantitative fashion. Fechner was a student of Weber and named his first law in honor of his mentor, since it was Weber who had conducted the experiments needed to formulate the law.
Fechner formulated several versions of the law, all stating the same thing. One formulation states:
"Simple differential sensitivity is inversely proportional to the size of the components of the difference; relative differential sensitivity remains the same regardless of size."
What this means is that the perceived change in stimuli is proportional to the initial stimuli.
Weber's law also incorporates the Just Noticeable Difference (JND). This is the smallest change in stimuli that can be perceived. As stated above, the JND is proportional to the initial stimuli. Fechner found that the JND is constant for any sense.
