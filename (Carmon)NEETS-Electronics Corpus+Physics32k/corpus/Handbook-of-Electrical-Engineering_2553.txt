The  hybrid-p  model  for  the  bipolar  transistor  may  now  be
inserted into the emitter-follower circuit of Fig. 24.33, resulting in
Fig. 24.34, from which the four midfrequency parameters may be
obtained. As an example of the procedures involved, consider the
derivation of the voltage gain expression.
Summing signal currents at the emitter,
