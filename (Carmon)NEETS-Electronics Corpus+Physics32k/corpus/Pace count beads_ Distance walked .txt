For every 100 meters the user walks, one of the lower beads is pulled down. When the ninth of the lower beads is pulled, the user has walked 900 meters. When the user has walked 1000 meters, one of the upper beads is pulled down, and all the lower beads are pulled back up.
Using this method the user must know the number of paces walked in 100 meters. An experienced user can also adapt the pace count for each hundred meters depending on the terrain. When using this method the user does not have to calculate distance from number of paces.
This method can of course be used for non-metric distances as well, though with the beads arranged in a different manner.
