In  color  transmissions,  a  third  synchronizing  signal  is  added  during  horizontal  scan  blanking  to  provide  a
frequency and phase reference for color signal encoding circuits in cameras and decoding circuits in receivers.
These  synchronizing  and  reference  signals  are  combined  with  the  picture  video  signal  to  form  a composite
video waveform.
