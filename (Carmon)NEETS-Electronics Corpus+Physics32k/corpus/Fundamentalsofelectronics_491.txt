(c) How does the magnitude of the systemâ€™s transfer function depend on the two delays?
Problem 4.17: Echoes in Telephone Systems
A frequently encountered problem in telephones is echo. Here, because of acoustic coupling between the ear
piece and microphone in the handset, what you hear is also sent to the person talking. That person thus
not only hears you, but also hears her own speech delayed (because of propagation delay over the telephone
network) and attenuated (the acoustic coupling gain is less than one). Furthermore, the same problem
applies to you as well: The acoustic coupling occurs in her handset as well as yours.
(a) Develop a block diagram that describes this situation.
(b) Find the transfer function between your voice and what the listener hears.
(c) Each telephone contains a system for reducing echoes using electrical means. What simple system
