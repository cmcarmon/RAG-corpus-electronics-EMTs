The evolution of the a-Si:H cell is illustrated in Fig. 60.14.
The development of various device structures has been an
integral  part  of  improving  solar  cell  performance.  The
inherent  light  instabilities  [Staebler  and  Wronski,  1977]
have  been  minimized  by  engineering  of  the  layer  thick-
nesses, and by the use of multiple or tandem structures. The
origins  and  cure  for  the  light  instabilities  have  not  been
completely  identiﬁed,  but  “stabilized”  cells  and  modules
having less than 10% change in output characteristics have
been produced. Many solar cells and modules with efﬁcien-
cies exceeding 10% have been reported and conﬁrmed.
