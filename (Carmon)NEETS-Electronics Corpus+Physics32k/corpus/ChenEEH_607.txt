The development of MOS-gate driven power devices has
greatly simpliﬁed the gate drive circuits. The devices have
made it possible to integrate the gate drive circuit into a
monolithic chip. With the current technology, it is also pos-
sible to add other functions, such as protection against ad-
verse operating conditions and logic circuits to interface with
microprocessors. In a typical smart power control chip, the
sensing and protection circuits are usually implemented using
analog circuits with high-speed bipolar transistors. These
circuits must sense adverse temperatures, currents, and volt-
ages. This circuitry helps detect situations like thermal run-
away, impact ionization, insufﬁcient gate drive, and so forth.
Present day Smart Power chips are manufactured using a
junction isolation technology. Efforts are in progress to
make lateral structures with high breakdown voltages and
thin epitaxial
layers. The dielectric isolation technology is
being perfected to replace the junction isolation technology
to achieve fewer parasitics, compactness, and a higher degree
of integration.
