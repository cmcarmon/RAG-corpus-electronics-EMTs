The presence of the dependent source in the circuit in Figure 2.67 does not
alter the manner in which our approach to circuit analysis is applied. While this
is an important observation, there is arguably a more important observation
concerning the analysis of the dependent-source circuit, namely that it can
proceed in stages. That is, it is possible to first analyze the operation of the
‘‘input side’’ of the circuit, that is, the independent voltage source and the
input of the dependent source, and then separately analyze the operation of
the ‘‘output side,’’ that is, the dependent current source and the resistor RL.
We will term this approach the sequential approach to circuit analysis.
