ﬁbrillation potentials [Fig. 113.18(F)], which are displayed on the oscilloscope screen and heard as clicks in the
loudspeaker. Although there is electrical activity, the muscle develops no net force. The ﬁbrillation potentials
persist as long as there are viable muscle ﬁbers. In such a denervated muscle, insertion of the needle electrode
elicits  a  vigorous  train  of  short-duration  insertion  potentials  that  resemble  ﬁbrillation  potentials  with  a  fre-
quency of about 1 to 10 per second. If the damaged ends of the nerve are brought together surgically, the central
end  of  the  nerve  will  start  to  grow  slowly  and  reinnervate  the  muscle.  Gradually  the  ﬁbrillation  potentials
disappear, although the muscle is still not able to be contracted. Long before there is visible evidence of muscle
contraction, if the subject is presented with the EMG display and asked to contract the affected muscle, primitive
muscle action potentials can be elicited. With the passage of time, the ﬁbrillation potentials disappear and there
is electrical silence at rest and primitive (nascent) motor-unit activity occurs with voluntary contraction. Later
when reinnervation is complete, only normal motor-unit potentials are present with voluntary contraction and
electrical silence at rest.
