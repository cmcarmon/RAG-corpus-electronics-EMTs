normally  be  selected  from  within  the  following 
ranges in order to provide satisfactory performance: 
 
C = 10 nF to 470 ÂµF 
 
R1 = 1 kG to 1 MG
R2 = 1 kG to 1 MG
The  required  values  of  C, R1 and  R2 for  any 
required  p.r.f.  and  duty  cycle  can  be  determined 
from the formulae shown earlier. Alternatively, the 
graph shown in Fig. 12.9 can be used when R1 and 
R2 are equal in value (corresponding to a 67% duty 
cycle).
