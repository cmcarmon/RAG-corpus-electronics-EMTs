circuit designed to increase the amplitude of 
an electronic signal. Amplifier circuits are one 
of the most basic circuits in electronics. Amplifier 
circuits make signal level greater, sound louder, and 
provide the circuit with gain. Gain is the ability of an 
electronic circuit to increase the amplitude of an elec-
tronic signal. This chapter looks at some unique types 
of amplifier circuits.
