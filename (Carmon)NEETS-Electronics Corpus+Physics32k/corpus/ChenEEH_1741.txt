The RT media types are further classiﬁed as discrete media
(DM) or continuous media (CM), depending on whether the
data is transmitted in discrete quantum as a ﬁle or message or
continuously as a stream of messages with intermessage
dependency. The real-time discrete type of media has recently
gained high popularity because of ubiquitous applications like
MSN/Yahoo messengers (which are error intolerant) and
instant messaging services like stock quote updates (which
are error tolerant).
