Vm and Im are the maximum values of the voltage and current,
v is the frequency of the signal in radians/second, and a and b
are called the phase angles of the voltage and current, respect-
ively. Vm, Im, and v are positive real values, whereas a and b
are real and can be positive or negative. If a is greater than b,
the voltage is said to lead the current, or the current to lag the
voltage. If a is less than b the voltage is said to lag the current,
or the current to lead the voltage. If a equals b, the voltage and
current are in phase.
