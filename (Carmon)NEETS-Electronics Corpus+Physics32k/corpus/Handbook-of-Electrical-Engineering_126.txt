Capacitor:  An electrical device capable of storing electrical energy and releasing it at some predetermined
rate at some predetermined time. It consists essentially of two conducting surfaces (electrodes) separated
by  an  insulating  material  or  dielectric.  A  capacitor  stores  electrical  energy,  blocks  the  ﬂow  of  direct
current, and permits the ﬂow of alternating current to a degree dependent essentially upon capacitance
and frequency. The amount of energy stored, E = 0.5 CV 2.
