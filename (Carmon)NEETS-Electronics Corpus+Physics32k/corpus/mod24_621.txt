A fiber optic transmitter is a hybrid device. It converts electrical signals into optical signals and
launches the optical signals into an optical fiber. A fiber optic transmitter consists of an interface circuit, a
source drive circuit, and an optical source. The interface circuit accepts the incoming electrical signal and
processes it to make it compatible with the source drive circuit. The source drive circuit intensity
modulates the optical source by varying the current through the source.
