You will have to have specific information about the computer you are to use. It will tell you how 
the language is implemented on that particular computer, in order to code a program. The computer 
manufacturers or software designer will provide these specifics in their user's manual. Get a copy of the 
user's manual and study it before you begin to code. The differences may seem minor to you, but they 
may prevent your program from running.
