Most of the energy is, therefore, directed down the guide to the antenna. Upon reaching the receiver
branch, the same effect is produced by the tr tube in the receiver line. Because the energy entering both
openings is effectively limited by the gaps, maximum energy is transferred between the magnetron and
the antenna.
