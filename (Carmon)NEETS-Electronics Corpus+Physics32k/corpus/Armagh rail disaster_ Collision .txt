The line was operated on the time interval system (rather than block working) so that there was no means at Armagh of knowing that the line was not clear. The required 20-minute interval before letting a fast train follow a slow one having elapsed, the following scheduled passenger train had left Armagh. With an engine of similar performance but a much lighter train (six vehicles) it was managing about 25 miles per hour (40 km/h) up the gradient when at a distance of about 500 yards (460 m) the driver of the ordinary train saw the approaching runaway vehicles: he braked his train, and had reduced speed to 5 miles per hour (8.0 km/h) at the moment of collision. By now, the runaways had travelled about 1 1‚ÅÑ2 miles (2.4 km). The pursuing driver said he did not believe they had reached more than 30 miles per hour (48 km/h); the Board of Trade inspector thought 40 mph (64 km/h) a fair estimate of their speed at the collision.
The engine of the scheduled train was overturned, and the connection to its tender lost. This train was also fitted with 'simple' (non-automatic) continuous vacuum brakes, and these were lost when the engine became disconnected. The train split into two sections both running back down the gradient towards Armagh. Application of the handbrakes on the tender and on the brake van brought the front and rear halves of the scheduled train to a stop without further incident, a witness telling the inspector "The tender was slightly damaged, but none of the vehicles, and I heard from the guard that a horse in the box next the tender was not injured".
The occupants of the rear of the excursion train were not so lucky. The two rearmost vehicles of the excursion train were utterly destroyed, and the third rearmost very badly damaged. The debris tumbled down a 45-foot-high (14 m) embankment.
