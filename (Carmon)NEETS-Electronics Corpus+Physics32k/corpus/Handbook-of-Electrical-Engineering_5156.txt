Piezoelectrics also fall under the category of active dielectrics. Electrets, which are capable of preserving an
electric  charge  for  a  long  period  of  time  (hence  regarded  analogous  to  permanent  magnets),  exhibit  highly
nonlinear dielectric properties.
Nonlinear Magnetic Properties
Ferromagnetic materials are materials in which the permanent magnetic dipoles align themselves parallel to
each  other.  These  materials  have  a  characteristic  temperature  below  and  above  which  their  properties  differ
greatly. This temperature is referred to as the Curie temperature. Above the Curie temperature they behave as
paramagnetic materials, while below it they exhibit the well known hysteresis B versus H curves. Examples of
such ferromagnetic materials are iron, Mu-metal, and Supermalloy. Ferrimagnetic materials are similar in their
hysteresis  properties  to  ferromagnetic  materials  but  differ  from  them  in  that  their  magnetic  dipoles  align
