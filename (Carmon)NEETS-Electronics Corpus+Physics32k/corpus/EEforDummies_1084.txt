Exploring a printed circuit board
Most printed circuit boards consist of a nonconductive (usually plastic) 
layer, known as the substrate, with copper interconnections on one or 
both sides. (Many industrial‚Äêstrength PCBs contain multiple layers, with 
components embedded in the substrate.) There are two types of copper 
interconnections: pads, which are small copper circles to which you solder 
components leads, and traces, which are short copper paths that, like wires, 
create connections between pads.
