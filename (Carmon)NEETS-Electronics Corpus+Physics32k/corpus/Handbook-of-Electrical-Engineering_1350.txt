A variable-rate speech coding algorithm has been standardized by the CTIA for wideband (CDMA) digital
mobile  cellular  telephony  under  IS-95.  The  algorithm,  QCELP  [Gardner  et  al.,  1993],  is  the  ﬁrst  practical
variable-rate speech coder to be incorporated in a digital cellular system. QCELP is a multi-mode, CELP-type
analysis-by-synthesis coder which uses blockwise spectral energy measurements and a ﬁnite-state machine to
switch between one of four conﬁgurations. Each conﬁguration has a ﬁxed rate of 1, 2, 4, or 8 kbits/s with a
predetermined allocation of bits among coder parameters (coefﬁcients, gains, excitation, etc.). The subjective
performance of QCELP in the presence of low background noise is quite good since the bit allocations per-
mode and mode-switching logic are well-suited to high-quality speech. In fact, QCELP at an average rate of
4 kbits/s has been judged to be MOS-equivalent to VSELP, its 8 kbits/s, ﬁxed-rate cellular counterpart. A time-
averaged encoding rate of 4 to 5 kbits/s is not uncommon for QCELP, however the average rate tends toward
the 8 kbits/s maximum in the presence of moderate ambient noise. The topic of robust ﬁxed-rate and variable-
rate speech coding in the presence of signiﬁcant background noise remains an open problem.
