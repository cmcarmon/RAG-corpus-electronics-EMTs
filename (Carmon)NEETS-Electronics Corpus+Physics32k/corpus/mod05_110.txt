The amplidyne is really a motor and a generator. It consists of a constant-speed ac motor (the prime 
mover) mechanically coupled to a dc generator, which is wired to function as a high-gain amplifier (an 
amplifier is a device in which a small input voltage can control a large current source). For instance, in a 
normal dc generator, a small dc voltage applied to the field windings is able to control the output of the 
generator. In a typical generator, a change in voltage from 0-volt dc to 3-volts dc applied to the field 
winding may cause the generator output to vary from 0-volt dc to 300-volts dc. If the 3 volts applied to 
the field winding is considered an input, and the 300 volts taken from the brushes is an output, there is a 
gain of 100. Gain is expressed as the ratio of output to input:
