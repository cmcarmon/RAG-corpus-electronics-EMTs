Figure 79.1 illustrates the transistor circuit blocks used in a standard TTL inverter. Four transistors are used
to  achieve  the  inverter  function.  The  input  to  the  gate  connects  to  the  emitter  of  transistor  Q1,  the  input
coupling transistor. A clamping diode on the input prevents negative input voltage spikes from damaging Q1.
The collector voltage (and current) of Q1 controls Q2, the phase splitter transistor. Q2, in turn, controls the
Q3 and Q4 transistors forming the output circuit, which is called a totem-pole arrangement. Q4 serves as a
pull-up transistor to pull the output high when it is turned on. Q3 does just the opposite to the output and
serves as a pull-down transistor. Q3 pulls the output low when it is turned on. Only one of the two transistors
in the totem pole may be turned on at a time, which is the function of the phase splitter transistor Q2.
