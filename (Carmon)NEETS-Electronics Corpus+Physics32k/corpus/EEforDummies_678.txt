Logical 1 and logical 0 are also referred to as true and false, or high and 
low. But what exactly are these ones and zeros in a digital circuit? They are 
simply high or low currents or voltages that are controlled and processed by 
transistors. (In ChapterÂ 10, I discuss how transistors work and how they can 
be used as on/off switches.) Common voltage levels used to represent digital 
data are 0 volts for logical 0 (low), and (often) 5 volts for logical 1 (high).
