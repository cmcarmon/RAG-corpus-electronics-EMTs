The most important issue is in the choice of a compactor. Although no “perfect” compactor can be found,
counting
several  have  been  shown  to  be  very  effective.  Several  compaction  techniques  have  been  researched: 
signature
, as in one’s count, syndrome testing, transition count, and Walsh spectra coefﬁcients; and 
techniques
 or linear cellular automata registers (LCARs).
analysis techniques
Only these latter ones are discussed here. LFSRs and LCARs are also the preferred implementation for the input
pattern generators.
