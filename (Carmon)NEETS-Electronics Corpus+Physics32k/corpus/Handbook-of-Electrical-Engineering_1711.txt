  in  the  picture.  One  usually  needs  at  least  6  bits  or  64  gray  levels  to  represent  an  image
adequately. Higher-quality imaging systems use 8 bits (256 levels) or even as many as 10 bits (1024 levels) per
pixel.  In  most  applications,  the  human  observer  cannot  distinguish  quantization  error  when  there  are  more
than 256 levels. (Many times the number of gray levels is cited in bytes. One byte is 8 bits, i.e., high-quality
monochrome digital imaging systems use one byte per pixel.)
