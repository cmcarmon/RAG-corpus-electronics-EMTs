Coherent Demodulation of CSK
Coherent demodulation is accomplished by reproducing copies of the basis functions in the receiver, typically
by  means  of  a  synchronization  scheme  [4]. When  synchronization  is  exploited,  the  synchronization  scheme
must be able to recover the basis function(s) from the corrupted received signal.
