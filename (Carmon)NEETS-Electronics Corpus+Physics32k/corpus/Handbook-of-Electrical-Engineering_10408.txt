Within dynamic systems, and the C3 systems that support them, it is important to identify and clarify time
scales involved. Military engagements range from sub-second events such as local missile point defense to the
long-term  development  and  implementation  of  global  strategy.  Each  involves  basic  aspects  of  decision  and
control theory: objectives, observations, and feedback and control. In the military environment, the observation
aspect is especially complex, requiring the placement, collection, transmission, and aggregation of data from
numerous dispersed sources. Control and decision techniques derived for one echelon level may be inappro-
priate for others, primarily due to the time available for the assessment and feedback process. Often, the impact
of a decision will not be measurable before yet another control decision is required. Thus, the relative roles of
automation and humans will be different at different levels. The human may have to project a decisionmaking
consequence long before the system hardware/software can obtain measures of it.
