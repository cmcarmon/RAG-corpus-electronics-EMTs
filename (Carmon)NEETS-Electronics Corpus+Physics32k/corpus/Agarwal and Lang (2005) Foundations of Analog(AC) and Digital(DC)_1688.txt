Equation 12.7 is referred to as the characteristic equation of the circuit
because it summarizes the internal dynamics of the circuit. The roots of the
characteristic equation, s1 and s2, are called the natural frequencies of the circuit
because they indicate the oscillation frequency of the natural circuit when no
forcing drive is present (see Equations 12.8 and 12.11). We have seen similar
equations and frequencies before in the context of first-order resistor-capacitor
and resistor-inductor circuits. For example, in Chapter 10, the characteristic
equations took the form
