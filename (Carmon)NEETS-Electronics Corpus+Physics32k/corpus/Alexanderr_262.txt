Solution:
Using  Schematics,  we  draw  the  circuit  in  Fig.  5.6(a)  as  shown  in
Fig. 5.35. Notice that the positive terminal of the voltage source vs is
connected to the inverting terminal (pin 2) via the 10-k⍀ resistor, while
the noninverting terminal (pin 3) is grounded as required in Fig. 5.6(a).
Also,  notice  how  the  op  amp  is  powered;  the  positive  power  supply
terminal V⫹ (pin  7)  is  connected  to  a  15-V dc  voltage  source,  while
the negative power supply terminal V⫺ (pin 4) is connected to ⫺15 V.
Pins  1  and  5  are  left  ﬂoating  because  they  are  used  for  offset  null
adjustment, which does not concern us in this chapter. Besides adding
the dc power supplies to the original circuit in Fig. 5.6(a), we have also
added  pseudocomponents  VIEWPOINT and  IPROBE  to  respectively
measure  the  output  voltage  vo at  pin  6  and  the  required  current  i
through the 20-k⍀ resistor.
