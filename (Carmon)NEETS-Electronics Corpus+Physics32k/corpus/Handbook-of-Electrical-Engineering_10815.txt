More broadly, the American Electronics Association (AEA) Design for Environment Task Force has created
a  series  of White  Papers  discussing  various  aspects  of  Design  for  Environment  and  its  implementation.  The
Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation (MCC) has published a comprehensive study [Lipp
et al.,
 1993] of the environmental impacts of a computer workstation, which is valuable not only for its technical
ﬁndings,  but  for  the  substantial  data  and  methodological  gaps  the  study  process  identiﬁed.  The  Society  of
Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) and others, especially in Europe, are working on a number
of comprehensive life-cycle assessment (LCA) methodologies designed to identify and prioritize environmental
impacts of substances throughout their life cycle. The International Organization for Standards (ISO) is in the
process  of  creating  an  international  LCA  standard.  The  IEEE  Environment,  Health  and  Safety  Committee,
formed  in  July,  1992,  to  support  the  integration  of  environmental,  health,  and  safety  considerations  into
electronics products and processes from design and manufacturing, to use, to recycling, refurbishing, or disposal
has  held  a  series  of  annual  symposium  on  electronics  and  the  environment.  The  proceedings  from  these
symposia are valuable resources to the practitioners of DFE.
