In Schwarzschild metric, the orbital velocity for a circular orbit with radius



r


{\displaystyle r}
is given by the following formula:




v
=




G
M


r
âˆ’

r

S








{\displaystyle v={\sqrt {\frac {GM}{r-r_{S}}}}}

where





r

S

{\displaystyle \scriptstyle r_{S}={\frac {2GM}{c^{2}}}}
is the Schwarzschild radius of the central body.
