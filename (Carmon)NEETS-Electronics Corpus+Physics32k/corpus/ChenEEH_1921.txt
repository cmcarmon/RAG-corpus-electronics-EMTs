Reconﬁguration in a circuit of dependent cells is analogous
to the method employed for independent cells. Inputs are
forwarded past the faulty cell and the computations, original
and checking, in all cells beyond the faulty cell are delayed by d
time units compared to those in the circuit that is not faulty.
Multiple FT can be obtained in either independent or de-
pendent cells by adding more spares. The pipelines forward
inputs (and outputs used for comparison) past the faulty cells,
and the computations in those cells beyond the faults are
delayed an additional d time units each time the pipeline ﬂows
past a faulty cell. If there are f  k faults in a k-FT REMOD
design, then the original computation has a time overhead of f d
in the worst case. Pipelines implemented with banks of multi-
plexers rather than delay lines can reduce this overhead to 0,
however (Dutt and Hanchek, 1997). In all cases, error detection
takes d more time after the original computation.
