Let us approach each question with regard to the models available. If the technology is not submicron, perhaps
a simpler model such as level 3 is capable of doing everything needed. If the technology is deep submicron,
then use a more complicated model such as BSIM, BSIM2, or BSIM3. If high accuracy is required, then the
best choice is BSIM3, mainly because it is more physical than all the other models and is capable of Ô¨Åtting better.
For a good physical understanding of the process being characterized. BSIM and BSIM2 are not good choices.
These are the least physically based of all the models. The level 2 and 3 models have good physical interpretation
for most of the parameters, although they are relatively simple models. BSIM3 is also more physically based,
with many more parameters than level 2 or 3, so it is probably the best choice.
