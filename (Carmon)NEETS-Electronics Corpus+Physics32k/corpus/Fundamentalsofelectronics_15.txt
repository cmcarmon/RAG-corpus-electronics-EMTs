Telegraphy represents the earliest electrical information system, and it dates from 1837. At that time,
electrical science was largely empirical, and only those with experience and intuition could develop telegraph
systems. Electrical science came of age when James Clerk Maxwell2 proclaimed in 1864 a set of equations
that he claimed governed all electrical phenomena. These equations predicted that light was an electro-
magnetic wave, and that energy could propagate. Because of the complexity of Maxwell’s presentation, the
development of the telephone in 1876 was due largely to empirical work. Once Heinrich Hertz conﬁrmed
Maxwell’s prediction of what we now call radio waves in about 1882, Maxwell’s equations were simpliﬁed
by Oliver Heaviside and others, and were widely read. This understanding of fundamentals led to a quick
succession of inventions–the wireless telegraph (1899), the vacuum tube (1905), and radio broadcasting–that
marked the true emergence of the communications age.
