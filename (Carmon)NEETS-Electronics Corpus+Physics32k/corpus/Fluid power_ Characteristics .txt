Fluid power systems can produce high power and high forces in small volumes, compared with electrically-driven systems. The forces that are exerted can be easily monitored within a system by gauges and meters. In comparison to systems that provide force through electricity or fuel, fluid power systems are known to have long service lives if maintained properly. The working fluid passing through a fluid motor inherently provides cooling of the motor, which must be separately arranged for an electric motor. Fluid motors normally produce no sparks, which are a source of ignition or explosions in hazardous areas containing flammable gases or vapors.
Fluid power systems are susceptible to pressure and flow losses within pipes and control devices. Fluid power systems are equipped with filters and other measures to preserve the cleanliness of the working fluid. Any dirt in the system can cause wear of seals and leakage, or can obstruct control valves and cause erratic operation. The hydraulic fluid itself is sensitive to temperature and pressure along with being somewhat compressible. These can cause systems to not run properly. If not run properly, cavitation and aeration can occur.
