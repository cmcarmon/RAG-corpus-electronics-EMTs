where µr is the relative permeability, which is a dimensionless constant. If the B–H characteristic
is nonlinear, as with a number of common magnetic materials, then the permeability varies as a
function of the magnetic induction. The variation of B with H is depicted by the saturation curve
of Figure 11.1.1, in which the slope of the curve clearly depends upon the operating ﬂux density,
as classiﬁed for convenience into regions I, II, and III.
There are several material classiﬁcations with their distinguishing characteristics. Ferromag-
netic materials, for which µr (cid:22) 1, exhibit a high degree of magnetizability and are generally
subdivided into hard and soft materials. Soft ferromagnetic materials include most of the steels
and iron, whereas hard ferromagnetic materials include the permanent-magnet materials such as
alnicos and alloys of cobalt with a rare-earth element such as samarium. Ferrimagnetic materials
are ferrites composed of iron oxides, subdivided into hard and soft categories. Ferroﬂuids (mag-
netic ﬂuids with iron-oxide particles suspended) and amorphous magnetic (soft ferromagnetic)
materials were also developed later. Typical magnetic characteristics of some core materials are
shown in Figure 11.1.2.
