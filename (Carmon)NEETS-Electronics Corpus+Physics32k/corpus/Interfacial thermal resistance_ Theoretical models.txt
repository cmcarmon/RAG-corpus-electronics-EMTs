There are two primary models that are used to understand the thermal resistance of interfaces, the acoustic mismatch and diffuse mismatch models (AMM and DMM respectively). Both models are based only on phonon transport, ignoring electrical contributions. Thus it should apply for interfaces where at least one of the materials is electrically insulating. For both models the interface is assumed to behave exactly as the bulk on either side of the interface (e.g. bulk phonon dispersions, velocities, etc.). The thermal resistance then results from the transfer of phonons across the interface. Energy is transferred when higher energy phonons which exist in higher density in the hotter material propagate to the cooler materials, which in turn transmits lower energy phonons, creating a net energy flux.
A crucial factor in determining the thermal resistance at an interface is the overlap of phonon states. Given two materials, A and B, if material A has a low population (or no population) of phonons with certain k value, there will be very few phonons of that wavevector to propagate from A to B. Further, due to the detailed balance, very few phonons of that wavevector will propagate the opposite direction, from B to A, even if material B has a large population of phonons with that wavevector. Thus as the overlap between phonon dispersions is small, there are less modes to allow for heat transfer in the material, giving at a high thermal interfacial resistance relative to materials with a high degree of overlap. Both AMM and DMM reflect this principle, but differ in the conditions they require for propagation across the interface. Neither model is universally effective for predicting the thermal interface resistance (with the exception of very low temperature), but rather for most materials they act as upper and lower limits for real behavior.
Both models differ greatly in their treatment of scattering at the interface. In AMM the interface is assumed to be perfect, resulting in no scattering, thus phonons propagate elastically across the interface. The wavevectors that propagate across the interface are determined by conservation of momentum. In DMM, the opposite extreme is assumed, a perfectly scattering interface. In this case the wavevectors that propagate across the interface are random and independent of incident phonons on the interface. For both models the detailed balance must still be obeyed.
For both models some basic equations apply. The flux of energy from one material to the other is just:

where n is the number of phonons at a given wavevector and momentum, E is the energy, and α is the probability of transmission across the interface. The net flux is thus the difference of the energy fluxes:

{\displaystyle E\ =\ \hbar \ \omega \left(k\right)\ \nu }

where ν is the speed of sound in the material. The main difference between the two models is the transmission probability, whose determination is more complicated. In each case it is determined by the basic assumptions that form the respective models. The assumption of elastic scattering makes it more difficult for phonons to transmit across the interface, resulting in lower probabilities. As a result, the acoustic mismatch model typically represents an upper limit for thermal interface resistance, while the diffuse mismatch model represents the lower limit.
