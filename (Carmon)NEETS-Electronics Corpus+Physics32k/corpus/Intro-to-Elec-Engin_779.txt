Bipolar transistors were the ﬁrst solid-state switching devices commonly used to implement digital
logic circuits in the 1950s and 1960s. These circuits used diodes at the input of the gate for logic
operation followed by a transistor (BJT) output device for signal inversion. One of the bipolar logic
families that emerged was called DTL (diode–transistor logic). The TTL (transistor–transistor
logic) soon replaced DTL and then became the principal bipolar technology for the next two
decades. It is still often used today. In TTL circuits, the diodes used in DTL at the gate input are
replaced with a multiemitter transistor for increased performance. Primarily by reducing the size
of the transistors and other components, speed and performance improvements have been made
in TTL circuits.
