As previously stated, an analog multimeter’s usefulness is limited by its low input impedance and
poor accuracy (typically – 2%). However, rugged construction and ease of operation make analog
multimeters extremely useful whenever poor accuracy and low input impedance can be tolerated. When
performing ac voltage measurements with a multimeter, be certain that the frequency of the signal being
measured falls within the upper and lower frequency limitations of the meter.
