The rate at which males seek mates is unspecific but relatively high. This is due to anisogamy and their drive to pass on alleles while minimizing competition.
Males will show the same drive to mate with previous mates as with new mates. The ability of a male cricket’s sperm to successfully fertilize a female’s egg after mating varies depending on various traits. An example of one trait that increases fertilization success is the amount of sperm that is effectively delivered through mating. The more sperm that is deposited results in greater fertilization success because more eggs are able to hatch. The order in which various males mate with one female before fertilization also affects fertilization success. The last male that mates with a female tends to have the highest fertilization success. Traits that increase the ability of a male’s sperm to successfully fertilize a female’s egg compared to that of another male are most advantageous. This is because these traits have been selected for over traits that have lower fertilization success.
