The separation of the knowledge base and the inference
engine is essential for the success of expert systems. It is very
important for a number of reasons: First, knowledge can be
represented in a more natural and declarative form that is
easier to understand and implement. For example,
if . . .
then . . . rules represent domain knowledge in a more declara-
tive form than embedding the knowledge in problem-solving
procedures. Second, developers can focus on creating and
organizing high-level knowledge rather than on the detailed
implementation. Third, changes made to the knowledge base
do not affect the function of inference engine and vice versa.
Finally, the same problem-solving techniques employed by the
inference engine can be used in a variety of applications.
