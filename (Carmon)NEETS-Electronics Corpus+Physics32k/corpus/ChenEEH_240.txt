tighter. Currently, the voltage tolerance is 5% (for a 3.3 V VRM
output with a voltage deviation of  165 mV). In the future,
the total voltage tolerance will be 2% (for a 1.1 V VRM output
with a voltage deviation requirement of only  33 mV). All of
these requirements pose serious design challenges and require
VRMs to have very fast transient responses. Figure 1.1 shows
today’s VRMs and the road map of microprocessors’ develop-
ment.
