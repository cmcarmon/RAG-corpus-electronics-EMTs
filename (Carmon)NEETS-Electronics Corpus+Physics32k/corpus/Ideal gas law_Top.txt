The ideal gas law, also called the general gas equation, is the equation of state of a hypothetical ideal gas. It is a good approximation of the behavior of many gases under many conditions, although it has several limitations. It was first stated by Émile Clapeyron in 1834 as a combination of the empirical Boyle's law, Charles's law and Avogadro's law. The ideal gas law is often written as




P
V
=
n
R
T
,


{\displaystyle PV=nRT,}

where:




P


{\displaystyle P}
is the pressure of the gas,




V


{\displaystyle V}
is the volume of the gas,




n


{\displaystyle n}
is the amount of substance of gas (in moles),




R


{\displaystyle R}
is the ideal, or universal, gas constant, equal to the product of the Boltzmann constant and the Avogadro constant,




T


{\displaystyle T}
is the absolute temperature of the gas.
It can also be derived from the microscopic kinetic theory, as was achieved (apparently independently) by August Krönig in 1856 and Rudolf Clausius in 1857.
