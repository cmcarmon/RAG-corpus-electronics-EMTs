DC-DC Converters
DC-dc converters are used to convert unregulated dc voltage to regulated or variable dc voltage at the output.
They are widely used in switch-mode dc power supplies and in dc motor drive applications. In dc motor control
applications, they are called chopper-controlled drives. The input voltage source is usually a battery or derived
from  an  ac  power  supply  using  a  diode  bridge  rectiÔ¨Åer.  These  converters  are  generally  either  hard-switched
PWM  types  or  soft-switched  resonant-link  types.  There  are  several  dc-dc  converter  topologies,  the  most
common ones being buck converter, boost converter, and buck-boost converter, shown in Fig. 30.17.
