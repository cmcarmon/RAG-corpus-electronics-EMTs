As previously mentioned, current measurements are usually taken by breaking the current path of the
circuit under test and electrically inserting a meter in series. This is normally accomplished by
disconnecting a wire from a terminal or unsoldering one end of a component and electrically inserting the
meter in series using the meter leads. This method is both time consuming and usually requires the use of
a soldering iron, which can damage components. Most analog multimeters cannot be used for measuring
ac current and are only accurate to within â€“ 2% on dc ranges.
