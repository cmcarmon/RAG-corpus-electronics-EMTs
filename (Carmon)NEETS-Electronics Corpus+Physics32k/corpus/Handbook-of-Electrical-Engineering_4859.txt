Consider  a  long  thin  bar “strain  gauge”  cut  from  a  piezoresistive  crystal  with  the  bar  length  parallel  to  an
arbitrary direction in the crystal. Let Pl, q, and j be the spherical coordinates of the longitudinal piezoresistivity
tensor measured along the length of the bar. For the cubic symmetry group Oh (m3m) of Si and Ge, Pl is given
