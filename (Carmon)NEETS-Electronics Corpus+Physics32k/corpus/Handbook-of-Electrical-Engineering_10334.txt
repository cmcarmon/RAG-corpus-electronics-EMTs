Network Management System
The network management system (NMS) is a critical element of a VSAT network. Through the NMS, the user
can have full control of his network, which is usually not possible in the case of terrestrial network facilities.
The NMS generally provides a centralized management tool for hub and VSAT equipment conÔ¨Åguration control,
assignment of inbound and outbound satellite channels, network monitor and control, switchover to back-up
equipment, network statistics collection, downline loading of new software, and report generation. In the shared
hub environment, the hub operator controls the allocation of resources among various users and controls the
RF transmission facility. The user must have the ability to manage his portion of the network transparent to
other users. In the case of a dedicated hub, a single management entity can exert full control over the network,
including RF transmission facilities.
