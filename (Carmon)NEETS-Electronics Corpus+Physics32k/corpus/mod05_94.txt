In the compound-wound generator when load current increases, the armature voltage decreases just 
as in the shunt-wound generator. This causes the voltage applied to the shunt-field winding to decrease, 
which results in a decrease in the magnetic field. This same increase in load current, since it flows 
through the series winding, causes an increase in the magnetic field produced by that winding.
