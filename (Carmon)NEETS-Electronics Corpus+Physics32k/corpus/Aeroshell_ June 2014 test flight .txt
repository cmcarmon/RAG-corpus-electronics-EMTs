The test flight took place on June 28, 2014, with the test vehicle launching from the United States Navy's Pacific Missile Range Facility in Kauaʻi, Hawaiʻi, at 18:45 UTC (08:45 local). A high-altitude helium balloon, which when fully inflated has a volume of 1,120,000 cubic meters (39,570,000 cu ft), lifted the vehicle to around 37,000 meters (120,000 ft). The vehicle detached at 21:05 UTC (11:05 local), and four small, solid-fuel rocket motors spun up the vehicle to provide stability.
A half second after spin-up, the vehicle's Star 48B solid-fuel motor ignited, powering the vehicle to Mach 4 and an altitude of approximately 55,000 meters (180,000 ft). Immediately after rocket burn-out, four more rocket motors despun the vehicle. Upon slowing to Mach 3.8, the 6-meter (20 ft) tube-shaped Supersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (SIAD-R configuration) deployed. SIAD is intended to increase atmospheric drag on the vehicle by increasing the surface area of its leading side, thus increasing the rate of deceleration.
Upon slowing to Mach 2.5 (around 107 seconds after SIAD deployment), the Supersonic Disk Sail (SSDS) parachute was deployed to slow the vehicle further. This parachute measures 33.5 meters (110 ft) in diameter, nearly twice as large as the one used for the Mars Science Laboratory mission. However, it began tearing apart after deployment, and the vehicle impacted the Pacific Ocean at 21:35 UTC (11:35 local) travelling 32 to 48 kilometers per hour (20 to 30 mph). All hardware and data recorders were recovered. Despite the parachute incident, the mission was declared a success; the primary goal was proving the flight worthiness of the test vehicle, while SIAD and SSDS were secondary experiments.
