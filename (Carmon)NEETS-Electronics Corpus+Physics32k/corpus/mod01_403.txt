Storage batteries are RATED according to their rate of discharge and ampere-hour capacity. Most 
batteries are rated according to a 20-hour rate of discharge. That is, if a fully charged battery is 
completely discharged during a 20-hour period, it is discharged at the 20-hour rate. Thus, if a battery can 
deliver 20 amperes continuously for 20 hours, the battery has a rating of 20 amperes Ã— 20 hours, or 400 
ampere-hours. Therefore, the 20-hour rating is equal to the average current that a battery is capable of 
supplying without interruption for an interval of 20 hours. (Note: Aircraft batteries are rated according to 
a 1-hour rate of discharge.)
