The number of modes that can exist in a fiber is a function of V. As the value of V increases, the
number of modes supported by the fiber increases. Optical fibers, single mode and multimode, can
support a different number of modes. The number of modes supported by single mode and multimode
fiber types is discussed later in this chapter.
