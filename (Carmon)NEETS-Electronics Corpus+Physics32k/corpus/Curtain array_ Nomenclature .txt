Since 1984 the CCIR has created a standardised nomenclature for describing curtain antennas, consisting of 1 to 4 letters followed by three numbers:
First letter - Indicates the orientation of the dipoles in the array:
"H" indicates the dipoles are oriented horizontally, so the antenna radiates horizontally polarized radio waves.
"V" indicates the dipoles are oriented vertically, so the antenna radiates vertically polarized radio waves.

Second letter (if present) - Indicates whether the antenna has a reflector. If it is missing, the antenna lacks a reflector, so the dipole array will radiate its energy in two beams in both directions perpendicular to its plane, 180° apart.
"R" indicates that there is a simple (passive) reflector on one side of the array, so the antenna radiates a single beam.
"RR" indicates that the array has some kind of "reversible reflector", so the direction of the beam can be switched 180°. Very few of this type have ever been built. RCI Sackville in Canada may have 2 HRRS type antennas—perhaps the only ones in North America.

Third letter (if present) - "S" indicates that the array is steerable.
Following the letters come three numbers "x/y/z". "x" and "y" specifies the dimensions of the rectangular array of dipoles, while "z" gives the height above the ground of the bottom of the array:
"x" (an integer) is the number of horizontal rows of dipoles.
"y" (an integer) is the number of vertical columns of dipoles.
"z" (a decimal fraction) is the height above ground in wavelengths of the lowest row of dipoles in the array.
For example, a "HRS 4/5/0.5" curtain antenna has a rectangular array of 20 dipoles, 4 dipoles high and 5 dipoles wide, with the lowest row being half a wavelength off the ground, and a flat reflector behind it, and the direction of the beam can be steered. An HRS 4/4/0.5 steerable antenna with 16 dipoles is one of the standard types of array seen at shortwave broadcast stations worldwide.
