. The system enables security and privacy. The most
important tool for transmission security and privacy is
the use of encryption. The encryption uses a cipher algo-
rithm to replace information with a ciphertext (output of
a cipher algorithm) using some mathematical algorithm.
Digital transmission system makes the manipulation of
digital information much easier.
