Albert Einstein went through several versions of light speed theory between 1905 and 1915, eventually concluding that light speed is constant when gravity does not have to be considered but that the speed of light cannot be constant in a gravitational field with variable strength. In the same book Einstein explained that he intended light speed to be a vector when it was described by coordinates in a reference frame.
Einstein was not explicit about whether the speed of light would change in a gravity field, or whether just the direction of the vector would change; this can be clarified from the text implicitly, however. A calculation of alpha (α) follows equation 107 and makes an unambiguous use of variable scalar light velocity (L) both as the argument of a partial differential function (proving a variable) and as the denominator in a fraction (proving not a vector) both in the same integrated quantity. Division by a vector is not defined, so there is no other way to interpret the velocity of light in this usage except as a variable scalar speed.
In this calculation L = c/c0 where c0 is light speed in flat space.

Peter Bergmann did not agree with Einstein, but left the dispute out of his earlier book in 1942 to get Einstein’s endorsement. After Einstein died Bergmann wrote a new book in 1968 claiming that vector light velocity could change direction but not speed. This has become a prevailing opinion in science, but not in agreement with Einstein’s unambiguous math. Bergman did acknowledge that the apparent speed of light would change in a gravity field and go to zero at an event horizon as viewed by a distant observer.
Max Born agreed with Einstein and stated both speed and direction of light change in a gravity field first published 1923 in English, 1920 in German. Born expressed the magnitude of light speed as the square root of (−g44/g11) gravity components in general relativity to leave no doubt about his intent.
Richard Tolman also agreed with Einstein and expressed the radial speed of light as dr/dt in a gravity field.
dr/dt = (1−2m/r)
where m is MG/c2 and where natural units are used such that c0 is equal to one.
