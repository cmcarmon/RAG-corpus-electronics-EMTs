A bouncing ball tribometer consists of a ball which is impacted at an angle against a surface. During a typical test, a ball is slid on an angle along a track until it impacts a surface and then bounces off of the surface. The friction produced in the contact between the ball and the surface results in a horizontal force on the surface and a rotational force on the ball. Frictional force is determined by finding the rotational speed of the ball using high speed photography or by measuring the force on the horizontal surface. Pressure in the contact is very high due to the large instantaneous force caused by the impact with the ball.
Bouncing ball tribometers have been used to determine the shear characteristics of lubricants under high pressures such as is found in ball bearings or gears.
