which is a common transverse phase term that must be the
same for all regions (if the transverse wave numbers kx or ky
were different between two regions, a matching of transverse
ﬁelds at the boundary would not be possible). The fact that the
transverse wave numbers are the same in all regions leads to
the law of reﬂection that states the direction angle u for a
reﬂected plane wave must equal the direction angle for the
incident plane wave. This fact also leads to Snell’s law that
states the direction angles u inside each of the regions are
related to each other, through the following:
