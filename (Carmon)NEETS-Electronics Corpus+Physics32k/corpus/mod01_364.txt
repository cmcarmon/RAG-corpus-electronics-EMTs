The Lithium-Organic Cell and the Lithium-Inorganic Cell are recent developments of a new line of 
high-energy cells. The main advantages of these types of cells are very high power, operation over a wide 
temperature range, they are lighter than most cells, and have a remarkably long shelf life of up to 20 
years.
