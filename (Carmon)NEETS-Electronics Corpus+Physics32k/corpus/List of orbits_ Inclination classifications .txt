Inclined orbit: An orbit whose inclination in reference to the equatorial plane is not 0.
Polar orbit: An orbit that passes above or nearly above both poles of the planet on each revolution. Therefore, it has an inclination of (or very close to) 90 degrees.
Polar Sun-synchronous orbit (SSO): A nearly polar orbit that passes the equator at the same local solar time on every pass. Useful for image-taking satellites because shadows will be the same on every pass.

Non-inclined orbit: An orbit whose inclination is equal to zero with respect to some plane of reference.
Ecliptic orbit: A non-inclined orbit with respect to the ecliptic.
Equatorial orbit: A non-inclined orbit with respect to the equator.

Near equatorial orbit: An orbit whose inclination with respect to the equatorial plane is nearly zero. This orbit allows for rapid revisit times (for a single orbiting spacecraft) of near equatorial ground sites.
