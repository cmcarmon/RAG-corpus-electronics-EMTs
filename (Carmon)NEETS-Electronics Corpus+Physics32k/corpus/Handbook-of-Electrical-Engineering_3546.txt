To  address  the  growing  computational  demands  of  simulation,  several  simulation  acceleration  techniques
have been introduced. Schedule-driven simulation, explained above, can be accelerated by removing layers of
interpretation  and  running  a  simulation  as  a  native  executable  image;  such  an  approach  is  called  complied,
scheduled-driven simulation.
