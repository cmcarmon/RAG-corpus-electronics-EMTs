There are two main parts to the measurement system: the track-side component, which contains hardware for communication, power, computation, and data acquisition, and the rail-mounted component, which consists of sensors and cabling. Known sensor principles include:
strain gauges: measuring the strain usually in the hub of the rail
fiber optical sensors: measuring a change of light intensity caused by the bending of the rail
load cells: Measuring the strain change in the load cell rather than directly on the rail itself.
laser based systems: measuring the displacement of the rail
