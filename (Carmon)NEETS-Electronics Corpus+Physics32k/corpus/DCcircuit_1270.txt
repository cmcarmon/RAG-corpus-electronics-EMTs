Again, the amount of current through the capacitor is directly proportional to the rate of
voltage change across it. The only difference between the effects of a decreasing voltage and
an increasing voltage is the direction of electron ﬂow. For the same rate of voltage change
over time, either increasing or decreasing, the current magnitude (amps) will be the same.
Mathematically, a decreasing voltage rate-of-change is expressed as a negative dv/dt quantity.
Following the formula i = C(dv/dt), this will result in a current ﬁgure (i) that is likewise nega-
tive in sign, indicating a direction of ﬂow corresponding to discharge of the capacitor.
