4rw ra is negative. The axial ratio in dB is given as R = 10log*r* . The polarization coupling is maximum when the
wave and antenna are copolarized, have identical axial ratios, and their polarization ellipses are aligned (Dt =
0). It is minimum when the axial ratios are identical, the senses are opposite, and the tilt angles differ by 90(cid:176).
