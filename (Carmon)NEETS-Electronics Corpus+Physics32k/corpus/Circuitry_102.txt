Charge, capacitance and voltage 
 
The  charge  or  quantity  of  electricity  that  can  be 
stored  in  the  electric  field  between  the  capacitor 
plates is proportional to the applied voltage and the 
capacitance of the capacitor. Thus: 
 
Q = CV 
 
where  Q is  the  charge  (in  coulombs),  C is  the 
capacitance  (in  farads),  and  V is  the  potential 
difference (in volts). 
 
Example 2.19 
 
A 10 uF capacitor is charged to a potential of 250 
V. Determine the charge stored. 
 
Solution 
 
The charge stored will be given by:
