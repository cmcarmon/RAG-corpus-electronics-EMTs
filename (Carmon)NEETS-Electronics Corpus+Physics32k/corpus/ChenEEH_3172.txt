Composite insulators are rated by their speciﬁed mechan-
ical load, which is deﬁned as the tensile load speciﬁed by the
manufacturer that has to be veriﬁed during a mechanical load
test. International standards require that every suspension
insulator unit is routinely tested with a 50% M- and E-rated
load for 10 secs. The relationship between the M and E rating
or SML rating of insulators, everyday load, maximum load,
and routine test load that every insulator is subjected to is
shown in Figure 5.4. It is clear that there is a comfortable safety
factor in the mechanical rating of the insulator.
