and planning at a human level. Intelligence is referred to as the
capabilities of the system to build and maintain situational or
world models, use dynamic knowledge representation, exploit
context, and leverage advanced reasoning and learning ca-
pabilities. Insight into human intelligence can help designers to
better understand users of CBVIR systems and construct more
intelligent systems. Benitez et al. (2000) proposed an intelli-
gent information system framework known as MediaNet that
incorporates both perceptual and conceptual representations
of knowledge based on multimedia information in a single
framework. MediaNet accomplishes this by augmenting the
standard knowledge representation frameworks with the ca-
pacity to include data from multiple media. It models the real
world by concepts, which are real-world entities and relation-
ships between those concepts that can be either semantic (car
Is-A-Subtype-Of vehicles) or perceptual (donkey Is-Similar-To
mule). In MediaNet, concepts can be as diverse-natured as
living entities (humans), inanimate objects (cars), events in
the real world (explosions), or certain property (blue). Media
representation of the concepts involves data from heteroge-
neous sources. Multimodal data from all such sources is
combined using the framework that intelligently captures
the relationships between its various entities.
