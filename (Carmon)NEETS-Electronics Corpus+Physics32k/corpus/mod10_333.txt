ELEVEN-YEAR SUN SPOT CYCLE.â€”One of the most notable phenomena on the surface of the 
sun is the appearance and disappearance of dark, irregularly shaped areas known as SUNSPOTS. The 
exact nature of sunspots is not known, but scientists believe they are caused by violent eruptions on the 
sun and are characterized by unusually strong magnetic fields. These sunspots are responsible for 
variations in the ionization level of the ionosphere. Sunspots can, of course, occur unexpectedly, and the 
life span of individual sunspots is variable; however, a regular cycle of sunspot activity has also been 
observed. This cycle has both a minimum and maximum level of sunspot activity that occur 
approximately every 11 years.
