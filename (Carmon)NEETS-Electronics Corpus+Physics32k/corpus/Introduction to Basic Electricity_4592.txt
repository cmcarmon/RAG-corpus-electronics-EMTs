Multiposition switches are widely used in many 
electronic circuits. However, circuits that operate at 
high speed require the multiplexer to switch at high 
speed and to be automatically selected. A mechanical 
switch cannot perform this task satisfactorily. There-
fore, multiplexers used to perform high-speed switch-
ing are constructed of electronic components.
