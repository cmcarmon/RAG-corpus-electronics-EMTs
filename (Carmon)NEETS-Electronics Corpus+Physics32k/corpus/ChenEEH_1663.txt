the content and reduce dimensionality of a subsequent match-
ing phase. A feature vector is then formed by linking the
three channel histograms into one vector. For image retrieval,

metric. One similarity metric that can be used in this context
is histogram intersection. The intersection of histograms h
and g is given by:
