The ﬁrst point-contact transistor developed at Bell Labs
in 1947 by John Bardeen, William Shockley, and Walter
Brattain, had a thin gold foil along the sides of a polysty-
rene triangle. The foil was slit at the triangle’s apex and
was pressed against a piece of germanium by the metal
piece at the top of the photo (Photo courtesy of AT&T
