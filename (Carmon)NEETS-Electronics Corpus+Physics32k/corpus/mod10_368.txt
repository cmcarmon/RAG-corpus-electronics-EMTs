Under normal atmospheric conditions, the warmest air is found near the surface of the Earth. The air 
gradually becomes cooler as altitude increases. At times, however, an unusual situation develops in which 
layers of warm air are formed above layers of cool air. This condition is known as TEMPERATURE 
INVERSION. These temperature inversions cause channels, or ducts, of cool air to be sandwiched 
between the surface of the Earth and a layer of warm air, or between two layers of warm air.
