For a given control system, stability is usually the most funda-
mental question to ask. If the system is linear and time-invari-
ant, many stability criteria are available. Among them are the
Routhâ€™s stability criterion and the Nyquist stability criterion.
If the system is nonlinear or linear but time-varying, however,
then such stability criteria do not apply.
