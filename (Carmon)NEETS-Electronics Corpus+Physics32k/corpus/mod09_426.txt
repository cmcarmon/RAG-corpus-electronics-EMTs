When power is applied to the circuit, R1 provides forward bias and transistor Q1 conducts. Current 
flow through Q1 and the primary of T1 induces a voltage in L2. The phasing dots on the transformer 
indicate a 180-degree phase shift. As the bottom side of L1 is going negative, the bottom side of L2 is 
going positive. The positive voltage of L2 is coupled to the base of the transistor through C1, and Q1 
conducts more. This provides more collector current and more current through L1. This action is 
regenerative feedback. Very rapidly, sufficient voltage is applied to saturate the base of Q1. Once the base 
becomes saturated, it loses control over collector current. The circuit now can be compared to a small 
resistor (Q1) in series with a relatively large inductor (L1), or a series RL circuit.
