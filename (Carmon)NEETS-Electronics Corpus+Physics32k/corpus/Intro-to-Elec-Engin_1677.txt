Figure 16.3.1(a) illustrates the basic elements of a typical closed-loop control system with
sampled data; Figure 16.3.1(b) shows the continuous-data input e(t) to the sampler, whereas
Figure 16.3.1(c) depicts the discrete-data output e*(t) of the sampler. A continuous input signal
r(t) is applied to the system. The continuous error signal is sampled by a sampling device, the
sampler, and the output of the sampler is a sequence of pulses. The pulse train may be periodic
or aperiodic, with no information transmitted between two consecutive pulses. The sampler in
the present case is assumed to have a uniform sampling rate, even though the rate may not be
uniform in some other cases. The magnitudes of the pulses at the sampling instants represent
the values of the input signal e(t) at the corresponding instants. Sampling schemes, in general,
may have many variations: periodic, cyclic-rate, multirate, random, and pulse-width modulated
