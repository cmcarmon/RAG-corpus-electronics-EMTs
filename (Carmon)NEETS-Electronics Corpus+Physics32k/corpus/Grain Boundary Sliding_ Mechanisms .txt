Homogeneous deformation in a polycrystalline solid cannot be achieved by grain boundary sliding alone. The grain movements must be accommodated with either diffusion or with dislocation motion. In the Earth's upper mantle, dislocation-accommodated grain boundary sliding is expected to be the dominant deformation mechanism for olivine.
