The direct-form I and direct-form II IIR ﬁlter realizations generally have very poor performance in terms
of  all  ﬁnite  wordlength  effects.  Therefore,  alternative  realizations  are  usually  employed.  The  most  common
alternatives are the cascade and parallel realizations where the direct-form II realization is used for each second-
order section. By simply factoring or expanding the original transfer function, round-off noise and coefﬁcient
quantization error are signiﬁcantly reduced. A further improvement is possible by implementing the cascade
or  parallel  sections  using  state-space  realizations  [Roberts  and  Mullis,  1987].  The  price  paid  for  using  state-
space realizations is an increase in the computation required to implement each section. Another realization
that has been used to reduce round-off noise and coefﬁcient quantization error is the lattice realization [Parks
and Burrus, 1987] which is usually formed directly from the unfactored and unexpanded transfer function.
