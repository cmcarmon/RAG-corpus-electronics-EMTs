A filter circuit consists of inductance, capacitance, and resistance used singularly or in combination, 
depending upon the purpose. It may be designed so that it will separate alternating current from direct 
current, or so that it will separate alternating current of one frequency (or a band of frequencies) from 
other alternating currents of different frequencies.
