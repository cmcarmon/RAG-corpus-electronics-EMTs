The  geometry  of  Fig. 48.4(c)  is  also  the  prototype  form  for  acousto-optic  interactions.  Here  the  second
transducer is not relevant and can be replaced by an acoustic absorber so that there is no reﬂected wave present
in the active region. An optical wave coming into the crystal as shown in Fig. 48.4(c) sees a propagating periodic
perturbation of the medium, and if the photoelastic coefﬁcients of the solid are large, the wave sees appreciable
variations in the refractive index and hence a moving diffraction grating. The angle of deﬂection of the output
optical beam and its frequency as produced by the grating depend on the amplitude of the various frequency
components in the acoustic beam when the optical beam traversed it. Thus, for example, the intensity versus
angular  position  of  the  emerging  optical  beam  is  a  measure  of  the  frequency  spectrum  of  any  information
modulated on the acoustic beam.
