desired characteristics without directly considering the error
energy. On the other hand, the least squares approach aims to
minimize the error energy. As can be observed in Figure 2.18,
there are solutions between these two extremal types of object-
ive functions that provide good trade-off between peak error
and error energy. In this section, we present a very ﬂexible
approach to designing FIR digital ﬁlters satisfying prescribed
