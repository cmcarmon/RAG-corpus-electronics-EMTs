The de Broglie equations relate the wavelength λ to the momentum p, and frequency f to the total energy E of a particle:

where h is the Planck constant. The equations can also be written as

or

where ħ = h/2π is the reduced Planck constant, k is the wave vector, β is the phase constant, and ω is the angular frequency.
In each pair, the second equation is also referred to as the Planck–Einstein relation, since it was also proposed by Planck and Einstein.
