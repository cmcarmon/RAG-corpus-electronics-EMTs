Low-voltage power management issues are becoming in-
creasingly critical in state-of-the-art computing systems. The
current generation of high-speed CMOS processors (e.g.,
Alpha, Pentium, and Power PC) operate at above 300 MHz
with 2.5- to 3.3-V output voltage. Future processors will be
designed with even lower logic voltages of 1 to 1.5 V and
