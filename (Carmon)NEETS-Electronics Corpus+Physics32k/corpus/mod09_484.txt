There are many ways to generate a trapezoidal waveshape. For example, the rectangular part could 
be generated in one circuit, the sawtooth portion in another, and the two combined waveforms in still a 
third circuit. A far easier, and less complex, way is to use an RC circuit in combination with a transistor to 
generate the trapezoidal waveshape in one stage.
