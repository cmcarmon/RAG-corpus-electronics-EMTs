Testing which attempts to exercise the structure, branching, and control ï¬‚ows of software is termed white-
box or sometimes glass-box testing. In this domain, a fairly rich variety of tools has come into existence since
1985 that can analyze the structure and complexity of software. For certain languages such as COBOL and C,
tools  are  available  that  not  only  analyze  complexity  but  can  restructure  or  simplify  it.  In  addition,  there  are
tools that can either create or aid in the creation of test cases. Quite a number of tools are available that can
monitor the execution of test cases and identify portions of code which have or have not been reached by any
given test run.
