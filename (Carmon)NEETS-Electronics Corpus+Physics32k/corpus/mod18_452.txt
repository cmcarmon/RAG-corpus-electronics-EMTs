A curve without well-defined minima, as in the curve shown in view C, indicates that the transmitter 
output is being frequency modulated during the pulse. This condition may occur when a pulse without 
sufficiently steep sides or a flat peak is applied to the transmitter. It may also occur when a transmitter 
tube is unstable or is operated without proper voltage, current, or magnetic field.
