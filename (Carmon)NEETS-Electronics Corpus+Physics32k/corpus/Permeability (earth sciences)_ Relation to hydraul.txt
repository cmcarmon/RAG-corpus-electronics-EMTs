The proportionality constant specifically for the flow of water through a porous media is called the hydraulic conductivity; permeability is a portion of this, and is a property of the porous media only, not the fluid. Given the value of hydraulic conductivity for a subsurface system, the permeability can be calculated as follows:




κ
=
K


μ

ρ
g





{\displaystyle \kappa =K{\frac {\mu }{\rho g}}}

where




κ


{\displaystyle \kappa }
is the permeability, m2




K


{\displaystyle K}
is the hydraulic conductivity, m/s




μ


{\displaystyle \mu }
is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, kg/(m·s)




ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
is the density of the fluid, kg/m3




g


{\displaystyle g}
is the acceleration due to gravity, m/s2.
