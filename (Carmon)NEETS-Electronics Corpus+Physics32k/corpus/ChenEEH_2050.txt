The above deﬁnitions are directly from ISO/IEC 2002.
Basically, an HLPN has three essential parts: (1) a net graph
NG deﬁning the syntax, (2) an underlying algebraic speciﬁca-
tion (Sig, V, H) deﬁning the semantic domain, and (3) a net
inscription (Type, AN, M0) mapping syntactic entities to their
semantic denotations. By restricting the underlying algebraic
speciﬁcation and/or the net inscription, different variations of
high-level Petri nets can be obtained.
