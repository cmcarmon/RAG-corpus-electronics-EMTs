From a system viewpoint, the two controllers of excitation and governor rely on local information (machineâ€™s
terminal voltage and rotor speed). In other words, they are decentralized controls. For large-scale systems, such
designs do not always guarantee a desired stable behavior since the effect of interconnection is not taken into
account in detail.
