The ~kkx and ~kky in these equations are the x and y components
of the numerical wavevector, and v is the wave angular fre-
quency. Substituting the traveling-wave expressions of equa-
tions 9.23 into the ﬁnite-difference equations of 9.21 yields,
after simpliﬁcation, the following relations for the lossless
material case:
