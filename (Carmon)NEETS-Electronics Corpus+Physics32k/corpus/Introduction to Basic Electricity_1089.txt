One of the most common ways to organize power 
tools is in bins or containers in the storage cabinet. Buy-
ing containers that can seal might be a good idea, because 
theyâ€™ll protect your power tools from dampness or any 
other hazard that could potentially damage them. Avoid 
storing the power tools too low to prevent back strain.
