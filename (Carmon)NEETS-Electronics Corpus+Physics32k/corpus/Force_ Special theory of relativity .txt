In the special theory of relativity, mass and energy are equivalent (as can be seen by calculating the work required to accelerate an object). When an object's velocity increases, so does its energy and hence its mass equivalent (inertia). It thus requires more force to accelerate it the same amount than it did at a lower velocity. Newton's Second Law

p

{\displaystyle {\vec {F}}={\frac {\mathrm {d} {\vec {p}}}{\mathrm {d} t}}}

remains valid because it is a mathematical definition. But for relativistic momentum to be conserved, it must be redefined as:

{\displaystyle {\vec {p}}={\frac {m_{0}{\vec {v}}}{\sqrt {1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}},}

{\displaystyle \gamma ^{3}m}
and

{\displaystyle \gamma m}
were called longitudinal and transverse mass. Relativistic force does not produce a constant acceleration, but an ever-decreasing acceleration as the object approaches the speed of light. Note that



γ


{\displaystyle \gamma }
approaches asymptotically an infinite value and is undefined for an object with a non-zero rest mass as it approaches the speed of light, and the theory yields no prediction at that speed.
If

γ


{\displaystyle \gamma }
is very close to 1 and
