(2) Results must be computed before the prespeciﬁed
deadline. When real-time constraint is not met, the
quality of services will be dramatically compromised.
(3) Vast amount of operations must be computed. The
data rate of a single Moving Picture Experts Group
MPEG-II encoded video signal stream can easily
exceed 20 million samples per second. On average,
each sample will require tens or even hundreds of
ﬁxed-point or ﬂoating point arithmetic operations
to process. Multiple streams of video and audio sig-
nals often need to be processed simultaneously. Hence,
signal processing algorithms are always computation-
intensive.
