There are programs that are analog electronic cir-
cuit simulators only. The more popular simulators in-
clude both analog and event-driven digital simulation 
capabilities. These programs, known as mixed-mode	
simulators, can simulate analog, event-driven digi-
tal, or a combination of both. An entire mixed signal 
analysis can be driven from one integrated schematic. 
All the digital models in mixed-mode simulators pro-
vide accurate information.
