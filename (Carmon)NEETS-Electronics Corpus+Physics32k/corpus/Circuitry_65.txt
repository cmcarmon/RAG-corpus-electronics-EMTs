Conclusion 
 
Comment  on  the  shape  of  the  graph.  Is  this  what 
you  would  expect  and  does  it  confirm  that  the 
current 
inversely 
proportional to the resistance in the circuit? Finally, 
use  Ohmâ€™s  Law  to  calculate  the  value  of  each 
resistor  and  compare  this  with  the  marked  value
