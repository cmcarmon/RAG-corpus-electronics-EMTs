An oscillator is a physical system characterized by periodic motion, such as a pendulum, tuning fork, or vibrating diatomic molecule. Mathematically speaking, the essential feature of an oscillator is that for some coordinate x of the system, a force whose magnitude depends on x will push x away from extremes values and back toward some central value x0, causing x to oscillate between extremes. For example, x may represent the angular position of a pendulum. When x is too positive or too negative, gravity pushes it back towards its lowest point.
In harmonic oscillators, the restoring force is proportional in magnitude (and opposite in direction) to the displacement of x from its natural position x0. The resulting differential equation implies that x must oscillate sinusoidally over time, with a period of oscillation that is inherent to the system. x may oscillate with any amplitude, but will always have the same period.
Anharmonic oscillators, however, are characterized by the nonlinear dependence of the restorative force on the displacement x. Consequently, the harmonic oscillator's period of oscillation may depend on its amplitude of oscillation.
As a result of the nonlinearity of anharmonic oscillators, the vibration frequency can change, depending upon the system's displacement. These changes in the vibration frequency result in energy being coupled from the fundamental vibration frequency to other frequencies through a process known as parametric coupling.
Treating the nonlinear restorative force as a function F(x-x0) of the displacement of x from its natural position, we may replace F by its linear approximation F1=F'(0)*(x-x0) at zero displacement. The approximating function F1 is linear, so it will describe simple harmonic motion. Further, this function F1 is accurate when x-x0 is small. For this reason, anharmonic motion can be approximated as harmonic motion as long as the oscillations are small.
