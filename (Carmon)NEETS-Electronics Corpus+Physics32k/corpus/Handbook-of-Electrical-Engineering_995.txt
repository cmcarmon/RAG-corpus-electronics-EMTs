depends on U0 and TOX; GAMMA depends on NSUB and TOX. If one is trying to obtain skew models, it is
much more advantageous to analyze statistical distributions of parameters that depend on a single effect than
those that depend on multiple effects. KP will depend on mobility and oxide thickness; U0 is therefore a more
fundamental parameter. We also did not obtain parameter PHI, so it will be calculated from NSUB. The level 3
model  is  very  insensitive  to  PHI,  so  using  it  for  curve  Ô¨Åtting  is  pointless.  This  illustrates  the  importance  of
being very familiar with the model equations. The kind of judgments described here cannot be made without
such knowledge.
