In the special case of constant acceleration, velocity can be studied using the suvat equations. By considering a as being equal to some arbitrary constant vector, it is trivial to show that





v

=

u

+

a

t


{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {v}}={\boldsymbol {u}}+{\boldsymbol {a}}t}

with v as the velocity at time t and u as the velocity at time t = 0. By combining this equation with the suvat equation x = ut + at2/2, it is possible to relate the displacement and the average velocity by





x

=



(

u

)

t




{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {x}}={\frac {({\boldsymbol {u}}+{\boldsymbol {v}})}{2}}{\mathit {t}}={\boldsymbol {\bar {v}}}{\mathit {t}}}
.
It is also possible to derive an expression for the velocity independent of time, known as the Torricelli equation, as follows:





v

{\displaystyle v^{2}={\boldsymbol {v}}\cdot {\boldsymbol {v}}=({\boldsymbol {u}}+{\boldsymbol {a}}t)\cdot ({\boldsymbol {u}}+{\boldsymbol {a}}t)=u^{2}+2t({\boldsymbol {a}}\cdot {\boldsymbol {u}})+a^{2}t^{2}}

∴

{\displaystyle \therefore v^{2}=u^{2}+2({\boldsymbol {a}}\cdot {\boldsymbol {x}})}

where v = |v| etc.
The above equations are valid for both Newtonian mechanics and special relativity. Where Newtonian mechanics and special relativity differ is in how different observers would describe the same situation. In particular, in Newtonian mechanics, all observers agree on the value of t and the transformation rules for position create a situation in which all non-accelerating observers would describe the acceleration of an object with the same values. Neither is true for special relativity. In other words, only relative velocity can be calculated.
