and the functional description is as follows. When the MUX is addressed to select an input, say, 
t

), the same
address  will  be  decoded  by  the  decoding  logic  to  generate  another  address,  which  is  used  in  addressing  the

programmable register. The programmable register contains further information regarding how to handle 
The outcome of the register is then used in subsequent tuning of the signal conditioner. Complex programmable
control tasks might include automatic gain selection for each channel, and hence the contents of this register
are known as the channel gain list. The MUX address generator could be programmed in many ways, and one
simple way is to scan the input channels in a cyclic fashion where the address can be generated by means of a
binary  counter.  Microprocessors  are  also  used  in  addressing  MUXs  in  applications  where  complex  channel
selection tasks are involved. Multiplexers are available in integrated circuit form, though relay MUXs are widely
used because they minimize errors due to cross talk and bias currents. Relay MUX modules are usually designed
as plugged-in units and can be connected according to the requirements.
