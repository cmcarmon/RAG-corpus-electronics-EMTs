The impact of satellites on world communications since commercial operations began in the mid-1960s is such
that we now take for granted many services that were not available a few decades ago: worldwide TV, reliable
communications with ships and aircraft, wide area data networks, communications to remote areas, direct TV
broadcast to homes, position determination, and earth observation (weather and mapping). New and proposed
satellite  services  include  global  personal  communications  to  hand-held  portable  telephones,  and  broadband
voice, video, and data to and from small user terminals at customer premises around the world.
