Now rarely used, but for many years the only way to move a disabled vehicle without using a low loader or trailer. Chains were attached, usually around the casualty's suspension, and some form of packing (often a seat squab or tyre) was inserted between the lifting frame and the casualty. This frame was lifted by means of a pulley until the casualtyâ€™s wheels were clear of the ground. An 'A' frame was normally used to keep the casualty from running into the tow vehicle on braking.
