Because jumpers usually land on their feet, most try to touch the dead center mark with the heel of their shoe. After the first 8 rounds are completed, the team competition ends and winners are declared. Based on the individual results, the best half of the skydivers do one individual semifinal jump where the score is added to the individual score. Based on this score the best half of the remaining skydivers make it to the last and final round. If the 3 first places are shared between skydivers with the same score, there are re-jumps to "sudden death". This means that different scores separate the skydiver for each of the first 3 places. In some competitions the organizers choose to use the skydiver with the most dead centers as the better skydiver.
The picture at right shows the final second before landing. The heel is poised over the dead center ensuring this will be the first place the skydiver touches the ground.
