The characteristic curve shown in Fig. 5.2 is representative of the current-
voltage dependencies of typical diodes. The diode conducts forward current
with  a  small  forward  voltage  drop  across  the  device,  simulating  a  closed
switch. The relationship between the forward current and forward voltage
is approximately given by the Shockley diode equation [Shockley, 1949]:
