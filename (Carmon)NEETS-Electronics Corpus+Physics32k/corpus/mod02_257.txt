As you know the sine wave can be compared to a circle. Just as you mark off a circle into 360 
degrees, you can mark off the time of one cycle of a sine wave into 360 electrical degrees. This 
relationship is shown in figure 4-2. By referring to this figure you can see why the current is said to lag 
the voltage, in a purely inductive circuit, by 90 degrees. Furthermore, by referring to figures 4-2 and 
4-1(A) you can see why the current and voltage are said to be in phase in a purely resistive circuit. In a 
circuit having both resistance and inductance then, as you would expect, the current lags the voltage by an 
amount somewhere between 0 and 90 degrees.
