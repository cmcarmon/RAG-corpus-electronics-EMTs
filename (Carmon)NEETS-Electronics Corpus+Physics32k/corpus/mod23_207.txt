Sometimes, a third input signal, which comes from the magnetic tape itself, is supplied to the 
comparison network. It's called a servo control from tape signal. Tape recordings made on a specific 
recorder are sometimes shipped off for further analysis and played back on a different recorder. To help 
compensate for speed errors in the tape transport systems of the two recorders, the precision reference 
frequency of the originating recorder is recorded onto a track of the magnetic tape. During playback, this 
reference signal is also fed to the recorder's comparison network and is used to correct speed errors.
