This section covers, albeit brieﬂy and in a sweeping over-
view, the electrical engineering aspects of the electric power
system. The electric power system, often referred to as the

mission, and distribution, all aspects of which are touched on
in the following chapters. The generation of electricity requires
the conversion of fossil (e.g., coal, oil, and gas), nuclear (e.g.,
ﬁssion), or renewable fuels (e.g., hydro, solar, wind, and
