If a sufficient amount of energy is absorbed by an electron, it is possible for that electron to be
completely removed from the influence of the atom. This is called IONIZATION. When an atom loses
electrons or gains electrons in this process of electron exchange, it is said to be ionized. For ionization to
take place, there must be a transfer of energy that results in a change in the internal energy of the atom.
An atom having more than its normal amount of electrons acquires a negative charge, and is called a
NEGATIVE ION. The atom that gives up some of its normal electrons is left with fewer negative charges
than positive charges and is called a POSITIVE ION. Thus, we can define ionization as the process by
which an atom loses or gains electrons.
