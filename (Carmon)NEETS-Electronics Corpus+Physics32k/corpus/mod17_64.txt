A GROUP is a collection of units, assemblies, subassemblies, and parts. It is a subdivision of a set or 
system, but it is not capable of performing a complete operational function. The coupler requires power 
and signals from the radiofrequency amplifier unit for operation. An example is the antenna coupler group 
in figure 1-4.
