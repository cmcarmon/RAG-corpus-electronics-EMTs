Tilting Suspension System (Also known as Leaning Suspension System) is not actually a different type or different geometry of construction, moreover it is a technology addition to the conventional suspension system.
This kind of suspension system mainly consist of independent suspension (e.g., MacPherson strut, A-arm (double wishbone)). With addition with these suspension system there is a further tilting or leaning mechanism which connects the suspension system with the vehicle body (chassis).
This kind of suspension system improves stability, traction, turning radius of vehicle and comfort of riders as well. While turning right or left passengers or objects on a vehicle feel G-force or inertial force outward the radius of curvature that is why Two Wheeler riders lean towards the center of curvature while turning which improves stability and decrease the chances of toppling. But for vehicle more than two wheels and with conventional suspension system could not do the same till now so the passengers feel the outward inertial force which reduce the stability of passengers and comfort as well. This kind of tilting suspension system is the solution of the problem. If the road do not have super-elevation or banking it will not affect the comfort with this suspension system, the vehicle tilt and decrease the height of center of gravity with increase the stability. This is also used in fun vehicle.
Some trains also use tilting suspension (Tilting Train) with increase the speed at cornering.
