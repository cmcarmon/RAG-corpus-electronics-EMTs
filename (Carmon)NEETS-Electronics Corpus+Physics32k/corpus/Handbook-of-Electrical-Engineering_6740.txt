Connector and cable-plant technology is another critical element of the physical layer. Thorough character-
ization of the transmission media is required if users are to interoperate with each other. The type of cable—e.g.,
shielded  or  unshielded  twisted  copper-wire  pairs,  coaxial  cable,  and  single-mode  or  multimode  optical
ﬁber—must be speciﬁed. Furthermore, the connectors between stations and the cable plant are deﬁned as part
of the physical layer. Stations can attach via passive taps or can actively repeat signals; in the latter case a bypass
switch is usually provided as the station’s interface to the cable plant.
