synchronization of the slot at the intended receiver. Guard times
are used between each userâ€™s transmission to minimize cross
talk between channels. In a TDMA/TDD system, half of the time
slots in the frame information message would be used for the
forward link channels and half would be used for reverse link
channels. In TDMA/FDD systems, an identical or similar frame
structure would be used for either forward or reverse transmis-
sion, but the carrier frequencies would be different for the
forward and reverse links.
