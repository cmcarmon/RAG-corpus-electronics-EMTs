Of the three hard-wired media (e.g., the twisted pair, coaxial
cable, and optical ﬁber), the use of coaxial cable in local
networks has started to phase out due to its heavier weight
and inﬂexibility to bend. The twisted pair is popular for lower
speeds (100 Mbps or less) of a local network, whereas the
optical ﬁber is more suitable for higher speeds (hundreds of
megabits per second or higher) of a local network. Of two
unguided media used in local networks, the microwave is used
to connect two LANs at different buildings, but both micro-
wave and infrared can be used for wireless LANs.
