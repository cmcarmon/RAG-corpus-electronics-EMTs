The planet is estimated to have 10 times the mass and two to four times the diameter of Earth. An object with the same diameter as Neptune has not been excluded by previous surveys in visible light. However, the infrared survey by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) may have the capabilities to detect such a planet.
Brown thinks that if Planet Nine exists, its mass is large enough to clear its feeding zone in 4.6 billion years (with possible exceptions for some combinations of semi-major axis and mass) and that its gravity dominates the outer edge of the Solar System, which is sufficient to make it a planet by current definitions. Jean-Luc Margot has also stated that Planet Nine satisfies his criteria and would qualify as a planetâ€”if and when it is detected.
Brown speculates that the predicted planet is most likely an ejected ice giant, similar in composition to Uranus and Neptune: a mixture of rock and ice with a small envelope of gas. In fact, if it once orbited the region of the gas/ice giants, the planet likely acquired an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Based on its size, the considerable gravitational pull of Planet Nine could theoretically promote life in subsurface oceans of its moons, were it to have any. Subsurface oceans have been discovered on Europa of Jupiter, Enceladus of Saturn, and subsurface water is postulated for Triton of Neptune.
