Global gravity anomalies, also termed as long-wavelength gravity anomalies, are the low-degree harmonics of the gravity field, which cannot be attributed to local isostasy, but rather finite strength of the mantle and density differences in the convection current. For Mars, the largest component of Bouguer anomaly is the degree one harmonic, which represents the mass deficit in the southern hemisphere and excess in the northern hemisphere. The second largest component corresponds to the planet flattening and Tharsis bulge.
Early study of the geoid in the 1950s and 1960s has focused on the low-degree harmonics of the Earth's gravity field in order to understand its interior structure. It has been suggested that such long-wavelength anomalies on Earth could be contributed by the sources located in deep mantle and not in the crust, for example, caused by the density differences in driving the convection current, which has been evolving with time. The correlation between certain topography anomalies and long-wavelength gravity anomalies, for example, the mid-Atlantic ridge and Carlsberg ridge, which are topography high and gravity high on the ocean floor, thus became the argument for the convection current idea on Earth in the 1970s, though such correlations are weak in the global picture.
Another possible explanation for the global scale anomalies is the finite strength of the mantle (in contrast to zero stress), which makes the gravity deviated from hydrostatic equilibrium. For this theory, because of the finite strength, flow may not exist for most of the region that are understressed. And the variations of density of the deep mantle could be the result of chemical inhomogeneities associated with continent separations, and scars left on Earth after the torn away of the moon. These are the cases suggested to work when slow flow is allowed to happen under certain circumstances. However, it has been argued that the theory may not be physically feasible.
