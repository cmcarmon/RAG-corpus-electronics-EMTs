Egg oil was traditionally used in treating wounds and injuries. In the 16th century, Ambroise Par√© used a solution of egg yolk, oil of roses, and turpentine for war wounds, an old method that the Romans had discovered 1000 years before him. He published his first book 'The method of curing wounds caused by arquebus and firearms' in 1545.
