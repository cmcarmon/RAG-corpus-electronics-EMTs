2. Bearing friction. Friction in the gimbal bearings results in loss of energy and incorrect gimbal 
positions. Friction in the rotor bearings causes mechanical drift only if the friction is not 
symmetrical. An even amount of friction all around in a rotor bearing results only in a change of 
the speed of rotation.
