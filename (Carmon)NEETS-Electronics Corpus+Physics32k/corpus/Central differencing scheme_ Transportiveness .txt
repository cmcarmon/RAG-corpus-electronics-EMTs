It requires that transportiveness changes according to magnitude of peclet number i.e. when pe is zero



φ


{\displaystyle \varphi }
is spread in all directions equally and as Pe increases (convection > diffusion)



φ


{\displaystyle \varphi }
at a point largely depends on upstream value and less on downstream value. But central differencing scheme does not possess Transportiveness at higher pe since Φ at a point is average of neighbouring nodes for all Pe.
