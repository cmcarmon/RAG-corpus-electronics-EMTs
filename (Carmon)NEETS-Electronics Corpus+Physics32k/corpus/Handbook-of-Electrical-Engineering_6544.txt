The ﬁrst efﬁcient ﬁber appeared in 1970, having a loss of 20 dB/km. Just 7 years later the ﬁrst large-scale
application,  a  link  between  two  telephone  exchanges  in  Chicago,  was  constructed.  By  this  time  the  loss  had
been reduced to around 3 dB/km. The digital technology used could accommodate a rate of 45 Mbps over an
unrepeatered length of 10 km and a total length of over 60 km with repeaters. The unrepeatered rate-length
product for this initial system was a modest 0.5 Gbps · km. As ﬁber technology advanced, this ﬁgure steadily
increased. Unrepeatered rate-length products have improved to 500 Gbps · km (e.g., 8 Gbps over a path of 60
km) and beyond. Allowing repeaters and/or optical ampliﬁers increases the net rate-length product considerably.
Values  beyond  70  Tbps  ·  km  (70,000  Gbps  ·  km)  are  achievable  with  optical  ampliﬁers.  This  latter  ﬁgure
allows construction of a transmission system operating at 5 Gbps over a 14,000-km path. The longest terrestrial
paths are across the Atlantic and Paciﬁc oceans, distances of about 6,000 and 9,000 km, respectively. Fibers are
capable of spanning these distances with high-capacity links.
