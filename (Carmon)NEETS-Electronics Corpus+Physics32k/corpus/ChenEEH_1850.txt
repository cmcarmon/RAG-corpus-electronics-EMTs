ITU-T recommendation H.323 (Thom, 1996; Liu and Mouch-
taris, 2000; Arora and Jain, 1999) is an umbrella recommenda-
tion that speciﬁes the components, protocols, and procedures
used to enable voice, video, and data conferencing over a
packet-based network like the IP-based Internet or IPX-based
local-area networks. H.323 is a very ﬂexible recommendation
that can be applied in a variety of ways—audio only (IP
telephony); audio and video (video telephony); audio and
data; and audio, video, and data—over point-to-point and
point-to-multipoint multimedia conferencing. It is not neces-
sary for two different clients to support the same mechanisms
to communicate because individual capabilities are exchanged
at the beginning of any session, and communication is set up
based on the lowest common denominator. Point-to-multi-
point conferencing can also be supported without the presence
of any specialized hardware or software.
