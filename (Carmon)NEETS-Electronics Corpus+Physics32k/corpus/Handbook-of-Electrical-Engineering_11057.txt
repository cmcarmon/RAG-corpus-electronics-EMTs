With the circuits shown in Figs. 113.25 and 113.26, it is necessary to use non-polarized capacitors. When a
long-duration pulse is desired, it is more practical to employ electrolytic capacitors because of their high energy
storage per unit of weight. When employing electrolytic capacitors, it is necessary to prevent reverse charging.
To achieve this goal, a diode (D) and a series current-limiting resistor (Rz) are placed across the capacitor, as
shown in Fig. 113.27. The resulting induced current waveform is shown on the right.
