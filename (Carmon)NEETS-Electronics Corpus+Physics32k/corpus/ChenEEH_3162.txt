Dielectric material is largely responsible for the electrical per-
formance of an insulator. It is important to distinguish be-
tween bulk or volume properties and surface properties. The
volume dielectric strength is determined by defects in the form
of impurities and voids in the system. The presence of these
defects serves to provide sites for electrical stress concentra-
tion, which could lead to the formation of a permanent failure
path in the system. Failures along the bulk of the material,
normally called punctures, are permanent in nature. The sur-
face dielectric strength is determined largely by surface de-
posits and moisture. Resistivity values, which are indicative
of the dielectric strength, are typically greater than 1010 V
per square for the bulk material (Looms, 1988). Under dry
conditions, such high surface resistance is also obtained. In the
presence of humidity, however, surface resistance values are
