Typical responses for the four cases when Vs equals zero
are shown in Figure 1.24. For circuits containing energy-
dissipating elements, namely resistors, the natural response in
general will die down to zero as t goes to inﬁnity. The com-
ponent of the response that goes to zero as time t goes
to inﬁnity is called the transient response. The forced re-
sponse depends on the forcing function. When the forcing
function is a constant or a sinusoidal function, the forced
response will continue to be present even as t goes to inﬁnity.
The component of the total response that continues to exist for
all time is called steady state response. In the next section,
computation of steady state responses for sinusoidal forcing
functions is considered.
