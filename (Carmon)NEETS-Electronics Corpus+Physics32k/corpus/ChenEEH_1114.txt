There are three basic approaches to determining the reliabil-
ity of MEMS. The ﬁrst is to make physics-based estimates of
the likelihood of different potential failures in various condi-
tions. This bottom-up approach to reliability can yield useful
understanding of the relevant parameters, but it is plagued
with large uncertainties. The second approach involves labora-
tory or factory testing for signiﬁcant periods of time, as
indicated in Figure 6.6. It has the advantage of being experi-
mental, and it permits the calculation of statistics from the
measured times or cycles to failure. Further, the ambient con-
ditions can be varied in this type of testing to obtain infor-
mation on the susceptibility to diverse kinds of failures of
particular MEMS that are operated in speciﬁc conditions.
