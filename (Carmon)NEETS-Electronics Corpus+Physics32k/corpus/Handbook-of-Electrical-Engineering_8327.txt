Structured Techniques
An alternate approach to improving the testability of digital circuits is to carry out the circuit design by following
certain rules that, by construction, assure high testability of the resulting circuits. Since the main problem in
achieving testability of a digital circuit is achieving adequate controllability/observability of its internal nodes,
structured DFT approaches [Bardell and McAnney, 1978] follow strict design rules that are aimed at achieving
this goal. Furthermore, most structured DFT approaches require/recommend additional design rules aimed at
preventing incorrect circuit operation as a result of signal races and hazards.
