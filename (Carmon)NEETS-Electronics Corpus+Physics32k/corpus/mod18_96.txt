Another effect of the atmosphere on radar performance is caused by particles suspended in the air.
Water droplets and dust particles diffuse radar energy through absorption, reflection, and scattering so
less energy strikes the target. Consequently, the return echo is smaller. The overall effect is a reduction in
usable range that varies widely with weather conditions. The higher the frequency of a radar system, the
more it is affected by weather conditions such as rain or clouds. In some parts of the world, dust
suspended in the air can greatly decrease the normal range of high-frequency radar.
