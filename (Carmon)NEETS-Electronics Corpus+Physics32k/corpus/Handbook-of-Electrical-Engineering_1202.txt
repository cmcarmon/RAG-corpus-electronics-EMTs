Linear Variety Property Sets
Theorem 3 is readily generalized to the case in which the individual attribute sets are closed linear varieties. A
set contained in vector space X is said to be a linear variety if it is a translation of a subspace contained in X.
More speciﬁcally, if C is a subspace of X and u is a ﬁxed vector contained in X, then the associated linear variety
is speciﬁed by
