where C is an n 3 n invertible, lower-triangular matrix and where the superscript T denotes matrix transpo-
sition. The representation (73.19) is known as the Cholesky decomposition. On multiplying the measurement
D (Y1, Y2, . . ., Yn )T satisfying (73.1)–(73.2) with noise covariance (, by C–1, we produce an equivalent
vector Y  =
(in  terms  of  information  content)  measurement  vector  that  satistiﬁes  the  model  (73.1)–(73.2)  with  white
Gaussian noise and with the signal conformally transformed. This model can then be treated using the methods
described previously.
