 (HL7) which is a data communications
protocol intended to facilitate the interfacing of various components in a hospital information system [Walker,
1989].  These  components  range  from  accounting  systems  (ﬁnancial  data)  to  clinical  laboratory  information
systems (laboratory test results) to medical records systems (documentation of patient care services) to patient
data management systems (physiological data). In the recent past, each such component was independent and
generally incompatible with other components. However, to achieve high quality in patient care at the lowest
cost, both administrators and clinicians need integrated, comprehensive access to a wide variety of information.
HL7 is an attempt to specify the types of data (and their formats) to be shared within a hospital information
system.  For  example,  if  all  components  of  the  system  use  a  common  format  for  a  patient’s  name,  then  it  is
possible for a single database query to gather all data regarding that patient. This also allows automation of
certain  activities  such  as  billing  (through  the  accounting  system)  for  laboratory  tests  ordered  by  clinicians
(through the clinical laboratory system). Unfortunately, HL7 has not achieved its promise but it does represent
a signiﬁcant step away from the chaotic past [Bond et al., 1990].
