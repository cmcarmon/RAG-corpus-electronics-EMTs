Mechanical splicing involves using mechanical fixtures to align and connect optical fibers.
Mechanical splicing methods may involve either passive or active core alignment. Active core alignment
produces a lower loss splice than passive alignment. However, passive core alignment methods can
produce mechanical splices with acceptable loss measurements even with single mode fibers.
