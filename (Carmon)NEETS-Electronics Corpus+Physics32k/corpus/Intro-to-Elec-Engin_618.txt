6.2.24 Give a block diagram for a modulo-5 binary ripple
counter using JKFFs and draw its timing diagram.
6.2.25 (a) For a JKFF with J K = 11, the output changes
on every clock pulse. The change will be co-
incident with the clock pulse trailing edge and
the ﬂip-ﬂop is said to toggle, when T = 1, for
the T ﬂip-ﬂop. Show JKFF connected as a T
ﬂip-ﬂop and its timing diagram.
