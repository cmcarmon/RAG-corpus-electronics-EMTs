Figure 2-11 shows a simple amplifier circuit with the input- and output-signal-developing
impedances represented by variable resistors. In this circuit, C1 and C2 are the input and output coupling
capacitors. R1 represents the impedance of the input circuit. R2 represents the input-signal-developing
impedance, and R3 represents the output impedance.
