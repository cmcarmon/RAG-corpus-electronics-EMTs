Unlike the transmitter, the receiver has an electrical input to its stator and a mechanical output from 
its rotor. The synchro receiver's function is to convert the electrical data supplied to its stator from the 
transmitter, back to a mechanical angular position through the movement of its rotor. This function is 
accomplished when the rotor is connected to the same ac source as the transmitter and assumes a position 
determined by the interaction of its magnetic field with the magnetic field of the stator. If you recall, this 
is the same concept discussed earlier under the operation of electromagnets.
