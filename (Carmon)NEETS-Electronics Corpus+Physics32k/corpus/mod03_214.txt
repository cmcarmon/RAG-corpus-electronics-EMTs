The wattmeter consists of two circuits, either of which will be damaged if too much current is passed
through them. This fact is to be especially emphasized in the case of wattmeters, because the reading of
the instrument does not serve to tell the user that the coils are being overheated. If an ammeter or
voltmeter is overloaded, the pointer will be indicating beyond the upper limit of its scale. In the
wattmeter, both the current and potential circuits may be carrying such an overload that their insulation is
burning, and yet the pointer may be only part way up the scale. This is because the position of the pointer
depends upon the power factor of the circuit as well as upon the voltage and current. Thus, a low power-
factor circuit will give a very low reading on the wattmeter even when the current and potential circuits
are loaded to the maximum safe limit. This safe rating is generally given on the face of the instrument. A
wattmeter is always distinctly rated, not in watts but in volts and amperes. Figure 1-45 shows the proper
way to connect a wattmeter in various circuits.
