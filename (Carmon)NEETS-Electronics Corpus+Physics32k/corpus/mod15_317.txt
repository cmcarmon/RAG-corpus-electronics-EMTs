The gyro can be considered as an enclosed mechanical system. The energy in the system is equal to 
the input energy. Hence the energy necessary to spin the gyro rotor is contained in the rotor as angular 
momentum, which is a function of rotor weight and the speed of rotor rotation. The heavier the gyro rotor, 
the larger the torque necessary to spin it, and the greater the angular momentum of the rotor. If we have 
two rotors with identical shapes but different weights spinning at the same velocity, the heavier of the two 
will be more rigid in its spin axis since it has the greater angular momentum.
