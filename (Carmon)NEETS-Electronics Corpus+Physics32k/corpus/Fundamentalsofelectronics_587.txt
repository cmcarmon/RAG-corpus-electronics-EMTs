Exercise 5.14
(Solution on p. 192)
Note that the spectrum of this stretched-signal example has a period equal to 1/2 and that the
spectrum is a “compressed” version of s(n)’s spectrum. Suppose that this stretched signal were
passed through a lowpass ﬁlter having a cutoﬀ frequency of 1/4. What eﬀect would this ﬁltering
have on the stretched signal? How would you interpret this eﬀect?
