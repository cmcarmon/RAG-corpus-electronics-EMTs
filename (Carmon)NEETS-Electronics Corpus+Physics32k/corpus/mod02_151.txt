or 1 × 10-6 farad, and 1.0 picofarad is equal to 0.000000000001 farad or 1.0 × 10-12 farad. Capacitance is a
physical property of the capacitor and does not depend on circuit characteristics of voltage, current, and
resistance. A given capacitor always has the same value of capacitance (farads) in one circuit as in any other
circuit in which it is connected.
