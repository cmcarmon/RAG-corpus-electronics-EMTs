Some textbooks will tell you that an element’s conductivity or nonconductivity is exclusively
determined by the number of electrons residing in the atoms’ outer ”shell” (called the valence
shell), but this is an oversimpliﬁcation, as any examination of conductivity versus valence
electrons in a table of elements will conﬁrm. The true complexity of the situation is further
revealed when the conductivity of molecules (collections of atoms bound to one another by
electron activity) is considered.
