The next concern after designing and simulating MEMS, that
is, deciding on the materials they will contain and the pro-
cesses needed to make them, is which fabrication facility to
employ. The designer can choose from a wide range of facil-
ities. Sometimes a standard IC facility can be used with post-
processing of the CMOS to remove material from the bulk
substrate and create a suspended structure on top of an etched
pit. For example, the micro-hot plate shown in Figure 6.5 was
realized in CMOS technology made through MOSIS, with a
postprocessing step of bulk micromachining to produce the
suspended thin Ô¨Ålm with a resistive heater. The small mass of
the heated element permits temperature changes of over 300 8C
in a few milliseconds. Many MEMS structures and devices have
been produced by such postprocessing of CMOS chips. Other
techniques, which are not compatible with CMOS, were also
used, in which case surface micromachining techniques pro-
duced mechanical structures on top of the substrate. Micro-
mirrors fabricated using surface micromachining are example
of such devices.
