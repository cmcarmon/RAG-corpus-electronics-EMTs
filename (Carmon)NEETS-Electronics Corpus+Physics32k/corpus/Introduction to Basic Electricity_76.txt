It	was	Thomas	Edison,	as	well	as	his	fellow	scientists,	Francis	Robbins	Upton,
who	contested	that	maximum	power	transfer	and	efficiency	are	only	relative;	the	2
concepts	are	not	one	and	the	same.	In	fact,	there	is	a	discussion	about	maximum
power	efficiency,	too.
In	the	exchange,	you	will	find	that	resistance	plays	an	important	role.	By	giving
light	to	the	former	argument,	you	can	calculate	a	circuit’s	capability	of	a	maximum
power	transfer,	in	relation	to	maximum	power	efficiency	with	the	following
formula:
MPT	=	RL	÷	(RL	+	RS)
A	circuit’s	MPT	(or	maximum	power	transfer)	can	be	determined	with	basic
arithmetic	skills.	First,	divide	the	RL	(or	Resistance	Load)	by	the	sum	of	the	RL
and	RS	(or	Resistance	Source).
