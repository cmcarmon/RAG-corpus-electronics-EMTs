If the load resistance (RL) were increased (the internal resistance remaining the same), the current
drawn from the source would decrease. Consequently, the voltage drop across the internal resistance
would decrease. At the same time, the terminal voltage applied across the load would increase and
approach a maximum as the current approaches zero amps.
