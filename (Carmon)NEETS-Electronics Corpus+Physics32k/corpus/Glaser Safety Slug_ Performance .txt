The company produces bullets in calibers from .25 to .45 for pistols and from .223 to .30-06 for rifles. Each caliber comes in two forms, "blue" and "silver", the latter having greater penetrating power due to the use of no. 6 birdshot rather than no. 12.
The projectile in the cartridge is of a lighter weight than more conventional types of cartridges and so the projectiles exit the bore at significantly higher muzzle velocities. The current bullet has a stable core of compressed lead shot. On impact, the bullet fractures along manufactured stress lines in the jacketâ€”imparting all the bullet's energy very quickly rather than over-penetrating a target or ricocheting on a miss. The light weight, and fragility of the projectile, make it unsuitable for long range firing or against protected targets.
The bullet design can produce deep wounds while failing to pass through structural barriers thicker than drywall or sheet metal. These qualities make it less likely to strike unintended targets, such as people in another room during an indoor shooting. Also, when it strikes a hard surface from which a solid bullet would glance off, it fragments into tiny, light pieces and creates much less ricochet danger.
