Figure 74.7 illustrates the link loss factors, maximum nadir angle, q, earth central angle, g, and earth-space
time delay as a function of satellite altitude. The delay for a single hop between two earth locations includes
the delays for the earth-space path, the space-earth path, and all circuit delays. The path losses are shown for
several satellite frequencies in use. The variation in path loss and earth central angle is substantial. For example,
L-band  LEO  personal  communications  systems  to  low-cost  hand-held  telephones  with  low  gain  (e.g.,  G  Â»
