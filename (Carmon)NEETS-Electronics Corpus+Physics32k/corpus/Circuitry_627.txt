Radiated power and efficiency 
 
In  the  case  of  a  transmitting  aerial,  the  radiated 
power, Pr, produced by the antenna is given by: 
P I
=
r
where Ia is the aerial current, in amperes, and Rr is 
the  radiation  resistance  in  ohms.  In  most  practical 
applications  it  is  important  to  ensure  that  Pr
is 
maximized and this is achieved by ensuring that Rr
is  much  larger  than  the  DC  resistance  of  the 
antenna elements. 
  The  efficiency  of  an  antenna  is  given  by  the 
relationship:
