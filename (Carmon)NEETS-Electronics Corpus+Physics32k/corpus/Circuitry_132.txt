Practical investigation  
 
Objective 
 
To  investigate  the  resistance  of  series  and  parallel 
combinations of resistors. 
 
Components and test equipment 
Breadboard,  digital  or  analogue  meter  with  d.c. 
current ranges, 9 V d.c. power source (either a 9 V 
battery or an a.c. mains adapter with a 9 V 400 mA 
output),  test  leads,  resistors  of  100  $, 220  $,
330 $, 470 $, 680 $ and 1k $, connecting  wire.
