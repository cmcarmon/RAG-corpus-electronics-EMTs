• Linear versus nonlinear control systems. Linear feedback control systems are idealized
models that are conceived by the analyst for the sake of simplicity of analysis and
design. For the design and analysis of linear systems there exist a wealth of analytical
and graphical techniques. On the other hand, nonlinear systems are very difﬁcult to treat
mathematically, and there are no general methods that can be used for a broad class of
nonlinear systems.
