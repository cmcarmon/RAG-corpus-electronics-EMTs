A simple example is shown in Figure 16.11, a circuit identical to the half-wave
rectifier already discussed, except for an added capacitor. The output waveform
of this circuit will follow the positive peaks of the input wave, so is more efficient
for converting AC to DC. The node equation at the vC node is
