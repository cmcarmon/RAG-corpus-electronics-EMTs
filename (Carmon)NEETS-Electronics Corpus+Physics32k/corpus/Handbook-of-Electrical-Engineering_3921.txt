where k0 = 2p/l0 and h = 
. The susceptance B is typically positive, implying a capacitive end effect. This
means that the resonant length of the patch will be slightly less than lg/2. If the feed probe is located a distance
s from the edge of the patch, the input impedance seen by the probe can be calculated using basic transmission
line theory from the circuit of Fig. 38.15. Resonance is deÔ¨Åned as the frequency at which the imaginary part
of the input impedance is zero.
