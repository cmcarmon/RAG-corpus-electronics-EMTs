A  B-mode  display  is  typically  used  for  ultrasound  imaging.  It  involves  display  of  the  echoes  at  various
brightness  or  gray  levels  corresponding  to  their  amplitude.  A  two-dimensional  B-mode  display  involves
movement of the transducer (manually or automatically), movement of a mirror to change the direction of
the ﬁeld (automatically), or movement of the ultrasound beam directly (electrically) such that it scans a plane
through the body. Figure 116.6 provides a simpliﬁed representation (again, echoes are shown as arising from
interfaces only) of the formation of a B-mode image. The direction of the beam is monitored so that the received
signals along each path are placed in their correct location on the display. Typically, the orientation information
and echoes are processed by a digital scan converter for appropriate display of the two-dimensional image on
