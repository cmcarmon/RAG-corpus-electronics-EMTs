bounds on end-to-end packet delay/jitter to be of acceptable/
decipherable quality. Applications that use this media type are
called real-time intolerant (RTI) applications. In most RTI
applications,
the end-to-end delay must be limited to
 200 msec to get an acceptable performance. Other applica-
tions like Internet Webcast, which involves one-way communi-
cation, have relatively low interactivity. Interactivity, in this
case, is limited to commands that allow the user to change
radio channels, for example, which can tolerate higher re-
sponse times. Consequently,
the Webcast requires weaker
bounds on delay/jitter, and the applications that use such
kind of media are termed as real-time tolerant (RTT) appli-
cations. Streaming audio is also used to refer to this media
type.
