HDTV
High-deﬁnition television (HDTV) has received much attention in the past few years. With the recent push for
all digital implementations of HDTV, the need for video signal processing techniques has become more obvious.
In order for the digital HDTV signal to ﬁt in the transmission bandwidth, there is a need for a compression
ratio of approximately 10:1, with little or no degradation introduced. The goal of HDTV is to produce high-
quality video signals by enhancing the detail, improving the aspect ratio and the viewing distance. The detail
is enhanced by increasing the video bandwidth. The proposed aspect ratio of 16/9 will allow for a wide-screen
format  which  is  more  consistent  with  the  formats  used  in  the  motion-picture  industry.  The  eye’s  ability  to
resolve ﬁne detail is limited. To achieve full resolution of the detail, the HDTV image should be viewed at a
distance of approximately three times the picture height. To accommodate typical home viewing environments,
larger displays are needed.
