2exp(–a*t*). If this process is also
Gaussian, then it is strongly stationary and all of its joint pdf’s are fully speciﬁed by RXX(t). In this case it is
also  a  ﬁrst-order  Markov  process  and  is  called  the  Ornstein-Uhlenbeck  process  [see  Gardner,  1990,  p.  102].
Unlike white noise, many real-world ws stochastic processes are correlated (*RXX(t, t + t)* > 0) for *t* > 0. The
autocorrelation either goes to zero as t goes to inﬁnity, or else it has periodic or other nondecaying memory.
We  consider  ws  processes  henceforth  [for  nonstationary  processes,  see  Gardner,  1990].  We  will  also  assume
without loss of generality that m = 0.
