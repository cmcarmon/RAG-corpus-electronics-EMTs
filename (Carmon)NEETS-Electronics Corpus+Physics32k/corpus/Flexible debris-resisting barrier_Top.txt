Flexible debris-resisting barrier, also known as protective rock barrier fence and rockfall catch fence, is a steel ring net barrier to resist the impact of landslide debris flow or boulders and prevent further downslope flow. Flexible debris-resisting barriers have been adopted as a mitigation measure for retention of potential landslide debris.
