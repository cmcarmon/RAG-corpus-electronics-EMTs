If this root location is investigated as the gain parameter K is varied upward from zero, it is seen that the root
starts at z = e–T/t for K = 0 and moves to the left along the real axis as K increases. Initially it is seen that the
system becomes faster, but at some point the responses become damped and oscillatory, and as K is further
increased the oscillatory tendency becomes less damped, and ﬁnally a value of K is reached where the oscillations
are  sustained  at  constant  amplitude.  A  further  increase  in  K  will  yield  oscillations  that  increase  with  time.
Typical unit step responses for r(k) = 1 and T/t = 0.2 are shown in Fig. 100.40.
