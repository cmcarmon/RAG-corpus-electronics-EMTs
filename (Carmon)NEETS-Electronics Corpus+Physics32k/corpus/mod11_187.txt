The SEGMENT-FED LOOP METHOD is shown in figure 2-35C. The loop intercepts the magnetic 
lines passing between cavities. The STRAP-FED LOOP METHOD (figure 2-35D), intercepts the energy 
between the strap and the segment. On the output side, the coaxial line feeds another coaxial line directly 
or feeds a waveguide through a choke joint. The vacuum seal at the inner conductor helps to support the 
line. APERTURE, OR SLOT, COUPLING is illustrated in figure 2-35E. Energy is coupled directly to a 
waveguide through an iris.
