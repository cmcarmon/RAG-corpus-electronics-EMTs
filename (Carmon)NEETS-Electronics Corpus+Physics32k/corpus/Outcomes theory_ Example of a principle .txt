An example of a principle within outcomes theory is the Impact evaluation only option for high-level outcome attribution if no controllable indicators at top of outcomes model principle. This is the principle that in an instance where building-block two (controllable indicators) does not connect to building block one of the outcomes model, then building-block five (impact evaluation) offers the only way to obtain more information about whether changes in high-level indicators can be attributed to an intervention.
