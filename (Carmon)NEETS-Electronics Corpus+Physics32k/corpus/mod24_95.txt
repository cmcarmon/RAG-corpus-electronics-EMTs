The amount of incident-wave energy that is reflected from a surface depends on the nature of the
surface and the angle at which the wave strikes the surface. The amount of wave energy reflected
increases as the angle of incidence increases. The reflection of energy is the greatest when the wave is
nearly parallel to the reflecting surface. When the incidence wave is perpendicular to the surface, more of
the energy is transmitted into the substance and reflection of energy is at its least. At any incident angle, a
mirror reflects almost all of the wave energy, while a dull, black surface reflects very little.
