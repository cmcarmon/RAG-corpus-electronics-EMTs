Sometimes it is necessary to determine the length of time that a reactive circuit will take to
reach a predetermined value. This is especially true in cases where we’re designing an RC
or L/R circuit to perform a precise timing function. To calculate this, we need to modify our
”Universal time constant formula.” The original formula looks like this:
