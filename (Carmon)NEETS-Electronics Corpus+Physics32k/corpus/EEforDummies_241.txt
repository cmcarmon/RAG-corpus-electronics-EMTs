In this chapter, you take a look at exactly what 
resistance is, where you can find resistance (every­
where), and how you can use it to your advantage 
by selecting resistors (components that provide 
controlled amounts of resistance) for your elec­
tronic circuits. Then you discover how to combine 
resistors to control current in your circuits. Next, 
you build and explore a few circuits using resis­
tors and light‐emitting diodes (LEDs). Finally, you 
discover just how important resistors are — and what 
happens when a critical resistor goes AWOL.
