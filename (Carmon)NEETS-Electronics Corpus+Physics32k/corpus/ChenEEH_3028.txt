Chapters 1 and 2 cover the general principles of three-phase
alternating current systems and the various electrical compo-
nents that make up the electric power system. Of these com-
ponents, electric machines are covered in the next
two
chapters, with Chapter 3 covering power transformers and
Chapter 4 covering rotating machines that generate electricity
(generators) or use electricity to do mechanical work
(motors). Chapters 5 and 6 cover high-voltage transmission
and lower voltage distribution, respectively. The rest of the
section is then devoted to system aspects, with Chapter 7
covering the analytical tools needed to study and design the
power system and Chapter 8 explaining operation and control.
Techniques and equipment to protect the power system against
short circuits are covered in Chapter 9. The concluding Chap-
ter 10 brieï¬‚y covers power quality issues that have become
more important today as electricity is used for more precise
applications like the production of integrated circuit chips.
