Ball change is a dance move that consists of two steps: on the ball of a foot behind or by the other foot, followed by a step on the other foot. This action has a syncopated feeling and counted &1, or &2, or a1, or a2, etc., i.e., the "ball" step splits off the end of a beat. It is used, e.g., in the kick ball change. A ball change is a simple transfer of weight from one foot to the other.
