The design of a transformer is determined by the 
frequency at which it will be used, the power it must 
handle, and the voltage it must handle. For example, 
the application of the transformer determines the type 
of core material that the coils are wound on. For low-
frequency applications, iron cores are used. For high-
frequency applications, air cores with nonmetallic 
cores used to reduce losses associated with the higher 
frequencies.
