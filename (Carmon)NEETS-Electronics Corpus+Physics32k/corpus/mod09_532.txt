A PARALLEL-LIMITER circuit uses the same diode theory and voltage divider action as series 
limiters. A resistor and diode are connected in series with the input signal and the output signal is 
developed across the diode. The output is in parallel with the diode, hence the circuit name, parallel 
limiter. The parallel limiter can limit either the positive or negative alternation of the input signal.
