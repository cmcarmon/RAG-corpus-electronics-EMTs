If  a  single  sinusoidal  basis  function  is  used,  then  a  narrow-band  phase-locked  loop  (PLL)  can  be  used  to
recover it [1]. Noise corrupting the transmitted signal is suppressed because of the low-pass property of the
PLL.  When  an  inherently  wideband  chaotic  basis  function  is  used,  the  synchronized  circuit  must  also  be
wideband in nature. Typically, both the “amplitude” and “phase” of the chaotic basis function must be recovered
from the received signal. Because of the wideband property of the chaotic basis function, narrow-band linear
ﬁltering cannot be used to suppress the additive channel noise.
