A very different approach to quantum gravity called loop quantum gravity is full non-perturbative, manifest background-independent: Geometric quantities, such as area, are predicted without reference to a background metric or asymptotics (e.g. no need for a background metric or an anti-de Sitter asymptotics), only a given topology.
