Additionally, we can use energy arguments to determine the envelope bounding the
decaying capacitor voltage. Recall that the magnitude of the capacitor voltage peaks
whenever the system energy resides entirely in the capacitor, and the inductor cur-
rent is zero. At t = 0, had all the energy been stored in the capacitor, the capacitor
voltage would have attained an absolute maximum value that we denote by VCM.
Accordingly, the decay in the capacitor voltage will be governed by a pair of expo-
nential curves (positive and negative) with initial values +VCM and âˆ’VCM at t = 0,
decaying to zero in about 5 cycles, as illustrated by the dotted curves in Figure 12.57c.
