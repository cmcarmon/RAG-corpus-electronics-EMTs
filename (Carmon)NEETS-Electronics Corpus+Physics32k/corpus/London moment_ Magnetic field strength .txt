The magnetic field strength associated with a rotating superconductor is given by:




B
=
−



2
M

Q



ω


{\displaystyle B=-{\frac {2M}{Q}}\ \omega }

where M and Q are the mass and the charge of the superconducting charge carriers respectively. For the case of Cooper pairs of electrons, M=2me and Q=2e. Despite the electrons existing in a strongly-interacting environment, me denotes here the mass of the bare electrons  (as in vacuum), and not e.g. the effective mass of conducting electrons of the normal phase.
