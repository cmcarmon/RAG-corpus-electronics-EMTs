If the lift and drag coefficients (CL and CD) for a sail at a specified angle of attack are known, then the lift (L) and drag (D) forces produced can be determined, using the following equations, which vary as the square of apparent wind speed (VA ):

Garrett demonstrates how those diagrams translate into lift and drag, for a given sail, on different points of sail, in diagrams similar to these:

Polar diagrams, showing lift (L), drag (D), total aerodynamic force (FT), forward driving force (FR), and lateral force (FLAT) for upwind points of sail

In these diagrams the direction of travel changes with respect to the apparent wind (VA), which is constant for the purpose of illustration. In reality, for a constant true wind, apparent wind would vary with point of sail. Constant VA in these examples means that either VT or VB varies with point of sail; this allows the same polar diagram to be used for comparison with the same conversion of coefficients into units of force (in this case Newtons). In the examples for close-hauled and reach (left and right), the sail's angle of attack (α ) is essentially constant, although the boom angle over the boat changes with point of sail to trim the sail close to the highest lift force on the polar curve. In these cases, lift and drag are the same, but the decomposition of total aerodynamic force (FT) into forward driving force (FR) and lateral force (FLAT) vary with point of sail. Forward driving force (FR) increases, as the direction of travel is more aligned with the wind, and lateral force (FLAT) decreases.
In reference to the above diagrams relating lift and drag, Garrett explains that for a maximum speed made good to windward, the sail must be trimmed to an angle of attack that is greater than the maximum lift/drag ratio (more lift), while the hull is operated in a manner that is lower than its maximum lift/drag ratio (more drag).
