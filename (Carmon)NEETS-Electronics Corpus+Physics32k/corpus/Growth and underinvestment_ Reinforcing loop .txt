The reinforcing loop consists of a growing action, such as units of a specific product shipped to a customer, and a current state, such as current demand for a specific product. The growing action causes a positive increase in the current state. The increase of the current state then in turn causes a positive increase of the growing action, thereby creating the reinforcing characteristic of the loop.
As discussed above, this reinforcing loop would have exponential behavior in time, if its growth wouldnâ€™t be bound by the combination of the two balancing loops present in the system.
