Sound is an oscillating pressure wave. As the pressure oscillates up and down, an audio point source acts in turn as a fluid point source and then a fluid point sink. (Such an object does not exist physically, but is often a good simplified model for calculations.)
Examples:
Seismic vibration from a localised seismic experiment searching for oil
Noise pollution from a jet engine in a large-scale study of noise pollution
A loudspeaker may be considered as a point source in a study of the acoustics of airport announcements
