Deﬁning the syntax of a HLL is easy. We simply write rules that deﬁne all legal combinations of the symbols
used by the language. Thus, in FORTRAN, we know that arithmetic statements obey the rules of algebra, with
some concessions to accommodate keyboards. A metalanguage is sometimes used as a kind of shorthand for
deﬁning the syntax of other languages, thus reducing the number of cases to be listed.
