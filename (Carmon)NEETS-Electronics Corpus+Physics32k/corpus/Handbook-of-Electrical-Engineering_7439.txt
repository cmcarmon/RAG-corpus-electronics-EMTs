Simulations can be developed to investigate either transient phenomena or steady-state properties of a system.
The  study  of  the  acquisition  time  of  a  phase-lock  loop  receiver  is  an  example  of  a  transient  phenomenon.
Simulations that are performed to study transient behavior often focus on a single subsystem such as a receiver
synchronization system. Simulations that are developed to study steady-state behavior often model the entire
system. An example is a simulation to determine the BER of a system.
