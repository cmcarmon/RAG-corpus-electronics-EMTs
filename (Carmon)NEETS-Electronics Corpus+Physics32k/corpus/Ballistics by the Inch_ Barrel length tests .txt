The initial round of tests, and most later ones tested handgun bullet velocity as it relates to the length of the barrel. The BBTI team wanted to test barrel lengths from 2 to 18 inches in one-inch increments. To have a consistent platform to test the various sizes and shapes of ammunition, a gunsmith was commissioned to create a custom barrel to fit each caliber tested. These barrels fit into a single housing and can be swapped out easily, so the team can remove them for cutting. Each brand of ammunition in each caliber/cartridge was tested at 18". Then, the barrel was removed and 1" was cut off the end of the barrel and the cut end was dressed. Once all the cartridges had been tested at 18" and the barrels were cut and ready, each brand was tested again at 17" and so on, right down to a 2" barrel. Three rounds of each brand of ammunition were fired at each barrel length and the velocity of the bullet was recorded as it passed over two commercial chronographs 15 feet away. The resulting six numbers were averaged and the average plotted on a graph for each brand and caliber of ammunition so that the trend in the velocity could be readily seen. To date (2012) tests have been run on 21 different calibers/cartridges.
