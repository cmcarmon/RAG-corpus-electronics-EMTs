Wafer-scale integration (WSI), which uses  uncut 
wafers containing entire computer systems  including  
memory, was developed in the 1980s. It failed  because 
of problems with creating a defect-free  manufacturing 
process. WSI was followed by system-on-chip (SOC) 
design. This process takes components that were 
typically manufactured on separate chips and wired 
 together on a printed circuit board and  designs 
them  to  occupy  a  single  chip  that  contains  the 
whole  electronic system: microprocessor, memory, 
 peripheral interface, input/output logic control, a/d 
 converters, and so on.
