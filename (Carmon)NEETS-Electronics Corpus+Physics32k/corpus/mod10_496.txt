The equivalent circuit of an open-ended transmission line is shown in figure 3-24, view A. Again,
losses are to be considered as negligible, and L is lumped in one branch. Assume that (1) the battery in
this circuit has an internal impedance equal to the characteristic impedance of the transmission line
(Zi = Z0); (2) the capacitors in the line are not charged before the battery is connected; and (3) since the
line is open-ended, the terminating impedance is infinitely large.
