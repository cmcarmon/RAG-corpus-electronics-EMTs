Similar to the conducting plane, the case of a planar interface between two different dielectric media can be considered. If a point charge



q


{\displaystyle q}
is placed in the dielectric that has the dielectric constant




ϵ

1




{\displaystyle \epsilon _{1}}
, then the interface (with the dielectric that has the dielectric constant




ϵ

2




{\displaystyle \epsilon _{2}}
) will develop a bound polarization charge. It can be shown that the resulting electric field inside the dielectric containing the particle is modified in a way that can be described by an image charge inside the other dielectric. Inside the other dielectric, however, the image charge is not present.
Unlike the case of the metal, the image charge




q

{\displaystyle q'}
is not exactly opposite to the real charge:

{\displaystyle q'={\frac {\epsilon _{1}-\epsilon _{2}}{\epsilon _{1}+\epsilon _{2}}}q}
. It may even have the same sign, if the charge is placed inside the stronger dielectric material (charges are repelled away from regions of lower dielectric constant). This can be seen from the formula.
