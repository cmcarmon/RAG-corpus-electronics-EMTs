Modulation
In Table 69.1, a generalized approach may be taken to obtain universal transmitter models that may be reduced
to those used for a particular modulation type. We also see that there are equivalent models which correspond
to different circuit conÔ¨Ågurations, yet they may be used to produce the same type of modulated signal at their
outputs. It is up to communication engineers to select an implementation method that will optimize perfor-
mance, yet retain low cost based on the state of the art in circuit development.
