Figure 33-10 shows a simplified diagram of a 
TRIAC. A TRIAC is a four-layer NPNP device in par-
allel with a PNPN device. It is designed to respond to 
a gating current through a single gate. The input and 
output terminals are identified as main terminal 1 
(Mt1) and main terminal 2 (Mt2). The terminals 
are connected across the PN junctions at the oppo-
site ends of the device. Terminal MT1 is the reference 
point for measurement of voltage and current at the 
gate terminal. The gate (G) is connected to the Pâ€“N 
junction at the same end as MT1. From MT1 to MT2, 
the signal must pass through an NPNP series of layers 
or a PNPN series of layers.
