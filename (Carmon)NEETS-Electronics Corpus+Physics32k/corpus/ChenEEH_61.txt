variables and may be taken as state variables. In a similar way,
if there are no sets of inductors and current sources that
separate the circuit into two or more parts, then the currents
associated with the inductors are independent variables and
may be taken as state variables. The following examples assume
that all the capacitor voltages and inductor currents are inde-
pendent variables and will form the set of state variables for the
circuit.
