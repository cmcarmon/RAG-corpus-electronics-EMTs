Assume that Q1 (figure 3-20) is initially saturated and Q2 is cut off. Recall that the voltage drop 
from the base to the emitter of a saturated transistor is essentially 0 volts. In effect, this places the base of 
Q1 at ground potential. The voltages developed in the voltage divider, âˆ’VCC, R6, R4, R1, and +VBB, are 
shown in the figure.
