buses). The relative simplicity of the computations involved in
each iteration step in equations 7.46 to 7.49 implies that the
algorithm is very fast to implement. On the other hand, the
error convergence rate is typically linear in the sense that the
ratios of the error norm from one iteration to the previous
iteration tend to be constant. Therefore, while the Gauss-Seidel
algorithm can converge to the proximity of the actual solution
in tens of iterations,
it typically takes a large number of
iterations to get to an accurate solution estimate.
