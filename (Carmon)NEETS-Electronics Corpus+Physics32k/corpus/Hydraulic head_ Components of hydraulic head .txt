is called the velocity head, expressed as a length measurement. In a flowing fluid, it represents the energy of the fluid due to its bulk motion.
The total hydraulic head of a fluid is composed of pressure head and elevation head. The pressure head is the equivalent gauge pressure of a column of water at the base of the piezometer, and the elevation head is the relative potential energy in terms of an elevation. The head equation, a simplified form of the Bernoulli Principle for incompressible fluids, can be expressed as:




h
=
ψ
+
z



{\displaystyle h=\psi +z\,}

where




h


{\displaystyle h}
is the hydraulic head (Length in m or ft), also known as the piezometric head.




ψ


{\displaystyle \psi }
is the pressure head, in terms of the elevation difference of the water column relative to the piezometer bottom (Length in m or ft), and




z


{\displaystyle z}
is the elevation at the piezometer bottom (Length in m or ft)
In an example with a 400 m deep piezometer, with an elevation of 1000 m, and a depth to water of 100 m: z = 600 m, ψ = 300 m, and h = 900 m.
The pressure head can be expressed as:

{\displaystyle \psi ={\frac {P}{\gamma }}={\frac {P}{\rho g}}}

where




P


{\displaystyle P}
is the gauge pressure (Force per unit area, often Pa or psi),




γ


{\displaystyle \gamma }
is the unit weight of the liquid (Force per unit volume, typically N·m−3 or lbf/ft³),




ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
is the density of the liquid (Mass per unit volume, frequently kg·m−3), and




g


{\displaystyle g}
is the gravitational acceleration (velocity change per unit time, often m·s−2)
