Similar to the previous case of numerical wave propagation
along the principal lattice axes, it is possible to choose S and
Nl such that ~kk is complex. In the speciﬁc case of equation 9.55,
the transition between real and complex values of ~kk occurs
when z ¼ 1. Solving for Nl at this transition results in:
