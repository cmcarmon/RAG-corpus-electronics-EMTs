Let us examine the amplifier circuit in Figure 7.19. We will do so by replac-
ing the MOSFET in Figure 7.19 with its SCS circuit model from Figure 7.15 as
illustrated in Figure 7.20. As our first step, let us determine the conditions on
the circuit such that the MOSFET is in saturation. When the MOSFET is con-
nected in a circuit as shown, the following relationships between the MOSFET
voltages and the circuit voltages apply:
