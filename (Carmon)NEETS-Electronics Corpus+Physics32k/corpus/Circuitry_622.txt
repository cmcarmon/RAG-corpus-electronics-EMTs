Hence,  a  vertical  dipole,  will  have  an  omni-
directional  radiation  pattern  whilst  a  horizontal 
dipole will have a bi-directional radiation pattern. 
This is an important point as we shall see later. The 
combined  effect  of  these  two  patterns  in  three-
dimensional space will be a doughnut shape.
