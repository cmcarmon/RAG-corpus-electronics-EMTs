Fixed-Point TMS320C25-Based Development System
TMS320C25-based development systems are now available from a number of companies such as Hyperception
Inc., Texas, and Atlanta Signal Processors, Inc., Georgia. The Software Development System (SWDS), available
from TI includes a board containing the TMS320C25, which plugs into a slot on an IBM compatible PC. Within
the SWDS environment, a program can be developed, assembled, and run. Debugging aids supported by the
SWDS include single-stepping, setting of breakpoints, and display/modiÔ¨Åcation of registers.
