microwave absorption. For example, nitrogen molecules do not possess permanent electric or magnetic dipole
moment and therefore play no part in microwave absorption. Oxygen has a small magnetic moment, which
enables  it  to  display  weak  absorption  lines  in  the  centimeter  and  millimeter  wave  regions. Water  vapor  is  a
molecular  gas  with  a  permanent  electric  dipole  moment.  It  is  more  responsive  to  excitation  by  an  EM  Ô¨Åeld
than is oxygen.
