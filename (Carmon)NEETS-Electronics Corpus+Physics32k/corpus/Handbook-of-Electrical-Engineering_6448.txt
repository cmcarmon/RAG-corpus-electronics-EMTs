For  FFH,  where  Rc  =  Rh,  the  spacing  between  FH/MFSK  tones  is  equal  to  the  hop  rate.  Thus,  the  entire
spread spectrum band is partitioned into a total of Nt = Wss/Rh = Wss/Rc equally spaced FH tones, each of which
is assigned to a unique k-tuple of the PN code generator that drives the frequency synthesizer. Since for FFH
there are Rh/Rs hops per symbol, then the metric used to make a noncoherent decision on a particular symbol
is obtained by summing up Rh/Rs detected chip (hop) energies, resulting in a so-called noncoherent combining loss.
Time Hopping Modulation
Time hopping (TH) is to spread spectrum modulation what pulse position modulation (PPM) is to information
modulation. In particular, consider segmenting time into intervals of Tf seconds and further segment each Tf
interval into MT increments of width Tf /MT. Assuming a pulse of maximum duration equal to Tf /MT, then a
time hopping spread spectrum modulation would take the form
