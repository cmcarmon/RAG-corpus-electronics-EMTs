Figure 33-2 shows the four layers divided into two 
3-layer devices. They are a PNP and an NPN transis-
tor interconnected to form a regenerative feedback 
pair. Figure 33-3 shows the schematic symbols for 
these transistors. The figure shows that the anode is 
positive with respect to the cathode, and the gate is 
open. The NPN transistor does not conduct because 
its emitter junction is not subject to a forward-bias 
voltage (provided by the PNP transistor’s collector or 
gate signal). Because the NPN transistor’s collector is 
not conducting, the PNP transistor is not conducting 
(the NPN transistor’s collector provides the base drive 
for the PNP transistor). The circuit does not allow cur-
rent to flow from the cathode to the anode under these 
conditions.
