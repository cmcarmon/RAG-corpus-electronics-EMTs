Real-time data conferencing capability is required for activ-
ities such as application sharing, whiteboard sharing, ﬁle trans-
fer, fax transmission, and instant messaging. Recommendation
T.120 provides this optional capability to H.323. T.120 is a
real-time data communication protocol designed speciﬁcally
for conferencing needs. Like H.323, Recommendation T.120 is
an umbrella for a set of standards that enable the real-time
sharing of speciﬁc applications data among several clients
across different networks.
