The last two terms of the right-hand side of the preceding
equation correspond to down-conversion and up-conversion,
respectively. Moreover, the mixing products are also propor-
tional to both RF and LO voltage. Mixing therefore exhibits
linear behavior rather than the square-law behavior found
with detection.
