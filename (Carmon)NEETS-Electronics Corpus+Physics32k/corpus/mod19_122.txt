Heat exhaustion (heat prostration or heat collapse) is the most common condition caused by working 
or exercising in hot spaces. Heat exhaustion produces a serious disruption of blood flow to the brain, 
heart, and lungs. This causes the victim to experience weakness, dizziness, headache, loss of appetite, and 
nausea.
