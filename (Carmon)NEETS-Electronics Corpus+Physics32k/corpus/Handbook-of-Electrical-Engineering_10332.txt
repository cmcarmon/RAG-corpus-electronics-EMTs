Direct modulation of the RF carrier may lower the cost of the VSAT IF and RF electronics while consolidating
modulation  and  upconversion  functions.  Direct  modulation  allows  the  design  of  a  VSAT  with  fewer  parts,
smaller size, and lower weight than with traditional outdoor units. Figure 102.8 is a block diagram showing a
conventional VSAT and a VSAT using direct modulation. An L-band receive interface between the ODU and
IDU is preferable in order to receive audio and video overlays.
