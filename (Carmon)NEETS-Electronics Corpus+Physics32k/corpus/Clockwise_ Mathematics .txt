In trigonometry and mathematics in general, plane angles are conventionally measured counterclockwise, starting with 0째 or 0 radians pointing directly to the right (or east), and 90째 pointing straight up (or north). However, in navigation, compass headings increase clockwise around the compass face, starting with 0째 at the top of the compass (the northerly direction), with 90째 to the right (east).
A circle defined parametrically in a positive Cartesian plane by the equations x = cos t and y = sin t is traced counterclockwise as the angle t increases in value, from the right-most point at t = 0. An alternative formulation with sin and cos swapped gives a clockwise trace from the upper-most point.
