The advantages that electrostrictors have over other actuator materials include low hysteresis of the strain-ﬁeld
response, no remanent strain (walk off), reduced aging and creep effects, a high response speed (<10 ms), and
strain values (>0.03%) achievable at realizable electric ﬁelds. Displacement ranges of several tens of microns
may be achieved with –0.01m reproducibility. Most actuator applications of electrostrictors as servotransducers
and micropositioning devices take advantage of these characteristics.
