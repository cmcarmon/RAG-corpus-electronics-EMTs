We already know P to be the average power. Since it is the real part of some complex quantity, it would be
reasonable to call it the real power. The complex quantity S of which P is the real part is, therefore, called the
complex power. Its magnitude is the product of the rms values of voltage and current: *S* = *V* *I*. It is called
the apparent power and its unit is the volt-ampere (VA). To be consistent, then we should call Q the imaginary
power. This is not usually done, however; instead, Q is called the reactive power and its unit is a VAR (volt-
ampere reactive).
