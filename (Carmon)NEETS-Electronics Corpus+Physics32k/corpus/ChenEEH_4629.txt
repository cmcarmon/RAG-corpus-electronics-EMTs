It is important to remember that the gain scheduling methods
just described are, in general, justiﬁed through repeated use
and do not have rigorous
justiﬁcation. The
methods are generally implemented in an ad hoc manner
appropriate to the problem at hand; achievable performance
may be sensitive to the form of scheduling law and the form of
the controller matrices.
