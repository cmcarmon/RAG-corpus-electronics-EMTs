As mentioned above, chemical molar flux of a component A in an isothermal, isobaric system is defined in Fick's law of diffusion as:






J


A


=
−

D

A
B


∇

c

A




{\displaystyle \mathbf {J} _{A}=-D_{AB}\nabla c_{A}}

where the nabla symbol ∇ denotes the gradient operator, DAB is the diffusion coefficient (m2·s−1) of component A diffusing through component B, cA is the concentration (mol/m3) of component A.
This flux has units of mol·m−2·s−1, and fits Maxwell's original definition of flux.
For dilute gases, kinetic molecular theory relates the diffusion coefficient D to the particle density n = N/V, the molecular mass m, the collision cross section

{\displaystyle \sigma }
, and the absolute temperature T by

{\displaystyle D={\frac {2}{3n\sigma }}{\sqrt {\frac {kT}{\pi m}}}}

where the second factor is the mean free path and the square root (with Boltzmann's constant k) is the mean velocity of the particles.
In turbulent flows, the transport by eddy motion can be expressed as a grossly increased diffusion coefficient.
