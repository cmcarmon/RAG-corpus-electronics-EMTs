 
and  the  frequency  response  is  shown  in  Figure  ###.  This  is  called  a  single-pole  filter 
since the denominator of the transfer function has only one root. The pass band gain of 
the filter is 0 dB or unity, while the stop band attenuation increases by 20 dB per decade.  
A  decade  is  a  10X  increase  in  frequency.  The  cutoff  frequency  is  defined  as  the 
frequency  where  the  input  signal  has  been  attenuated  by  a  factor  of  0.707,  which  is 
equivalent to a gain of -3 dB. The cutoff frequency of the single-pole filter is
