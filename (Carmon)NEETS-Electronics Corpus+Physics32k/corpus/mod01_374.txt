The silver-cadmium cell is a fairly recent development for use in storage batteries. The silver-
cadmium cell combines some of the better features of the nickel-cadmium and silver-zinc cells. It has 
more than twice the shelf life of the silver-zinc cell and can be recharged many more times. The 
disadvantages of the silver-cadmium cell are high cost and low voltage production.
