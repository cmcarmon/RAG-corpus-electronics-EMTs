BRIDGE RECTIFIERS are full-wave rectifiers that do not use a center-tapped, high-voltage 
secondary. Because of this, their dc output voltage is equal to the input voltage from the high-voltage 
secondary of the power transformer. Bridge rectifiers use four diodes connected in a bridge network. 
Diodes conduct in diagonal pairs to give a full-wave pulsating dc output.
