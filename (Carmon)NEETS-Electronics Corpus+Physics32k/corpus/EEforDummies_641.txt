Are you’re wondering why you don’t just supply the current from the pho-
todiode to the gadget? Your gadget might need a larger current than can be 
supplied by the photodiode. The small photodiode current controls the on/
off action of the transistor, which acts like a switch to allow a larger current 
from a battery to power your gadget.
