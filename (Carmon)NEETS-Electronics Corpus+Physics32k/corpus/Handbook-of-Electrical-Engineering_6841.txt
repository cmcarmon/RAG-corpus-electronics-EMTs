If the signal is random but not Gaussian, then its optimum detection [described by (73.6)] typically requires
more complicated nonlinear processing than the quadratic processing of (73.13) in order to exploit the distri-
butional differences between signal and noise. This type of processing is often not practical for implementation,
and thus approximations to the optimum detector are typically used. An interesting family of such detectors
uses cubic or quartic functions of the measurements, which exploit the higher-order spectral properties of the
signal [Mendel, 1991]. As with deterministic signals, random signals can be parametrized. In this case, however,
it is the distribution of the signal that is parametrized. For example, the power spectrum of the signal of interest
may be known only up to a set of unknown parameters. Generalized likelihood ratio detectors (73.9) are often
used to detect such signals.
