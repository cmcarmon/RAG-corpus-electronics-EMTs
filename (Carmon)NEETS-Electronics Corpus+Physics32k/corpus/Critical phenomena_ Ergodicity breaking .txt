Ergodicity is the assumption that a system, at a given temperature, explores the full phase space, just each state takes different probabilities. In an Ising ferromagnet below

{\displaystyle T_{c}}
this does not happen. If



T
<

T

c




{\displaystyle T<T_{c}}
, never mind how close they are, the system has chosen a global magnetization, and the phase space is divided into two regions. From one of them it is impossible to reach the other, unless a magnetic field is applied, or temperature is raised above

{\displaystyle T_{c}}
