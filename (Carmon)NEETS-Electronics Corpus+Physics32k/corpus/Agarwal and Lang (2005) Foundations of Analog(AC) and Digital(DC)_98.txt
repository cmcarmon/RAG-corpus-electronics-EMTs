Let us dwell for a little longer on the third constraint. The lumped element
approximation requires that we be able to define a voltage V between a pair of
element terminals (for example, the two ends of a bulb filament) and a current
through the terminal pair. Defining a current through the element means that
the current in must equal the current out. Now consider the following thought
experiment. Apply a current pulse at one terminal of the filament at time instant
t and observe both the current into this terminal and the current out of the
other terminal at a time instant t + dt very close to t. If the filament were
long enough, or if dt were small enough, the finite speed of electromagnetic
waves might result in our measuring different values for the current in and the
current out.
