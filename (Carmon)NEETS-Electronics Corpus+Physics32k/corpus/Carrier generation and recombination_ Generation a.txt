Carrier generation and recombination occur when an electron makes transition from the valence band to conduction band in a semiconductor, as a result of interaction with other electrons, holes, photons, or the vibrating crystal lattice itself. These processes must conserve both quantized energy and momentum, and the vibrating lattice plays a large role in conserving momentum as photons carry very little momentum in relation to their energy.
Recombination and generation are always happening in semiconductors, both optically and thermally, and their rates are in balance at equilibrium. The product of the electron and hole densities (

at equilibrium, maintained by recombination and generation occurring at equal rates. When there is a surplus of carriers (i.e.,

>

{\displaystyle np>n_{i}^{2}}
), the rate of recombination becomes greater than the rate of generation, driving the system back towards equilibrium. Likewise, when there is a deficit of carriers (i.e.,



n
p
<

i

{\displaystyle np<n_{i}^{2}}
), the generation rate becomes greater than the recombination rate, again driving the system back towards equilibrium. As the electron moves from one energy band to another, the energy and momentum that it has lost or gained must go to or come from the other particles involved in the process (e.g. photons, electron, or the system of vibrating lattice atoms). The following models are used to describe generation and recombination, depending on which particles are involved in the process.
