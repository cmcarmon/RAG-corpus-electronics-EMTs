Another way of looking at it is that PCBs are de-
clared utilitarian works. It is the functionality of the 
PCB to be protected, not the layout of the PCB. Should 
the layout be awarded copyright, the layout is pro-
tected only in the aesthetic aspects under the law. It is 
then only protected to the extent that the aesthetic as-
pects are separable from the functionality of the PCB. 
Because PCB layouts are dictated solely by function, 
and not by aesthetics, the copyright protection is weak 
or nonexistent. There is no coverage for PCB layouts or 
for schematic diagrams other than where a schematic di-
agram contains entirely proprietary silicon and the PCB 
layout is necessary to the added function of the silicon. 
In lieu of enforceable copyright, the best way to  
protect  PCBs  is  through  continually  upgrading
