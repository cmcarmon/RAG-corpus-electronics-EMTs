The number of electrons in the outermost shell determines the valence of an atom. For this reason,
the outer shell of an atom is called the VALENCE SHELL; and the electrons contained in this shell are
called VALENCE ELECTRONS. The valence of an atom determines its ability to gain or lose an
electron, which in turn determines the chemical and electrical properties of the atom. An atom that is
