High-Bay Areas. The work generally presents visual tasks that are not difÔ¨Åcult because of large machinery
and other objects. Illuminance levels for high-bay areas generally range from 50 to 150 fc, although more and
more areas are being lighted with 200 and 300 fc. At a high mounting height, it is possible to obtain uniform
illumination  by  using  a  few  high-wattage  sources  rather  than  a  larger  number  of  low-wattage  sources.  For
luminaires  with  medium  and  narrow  distribution,  greater  mounting  height  or  closer  spacing  is  ordinarily
required for uniform general illumination.
