CORE MATERIAL—(1) hard core material.—(a) Hard metal laminations bonded together to
form the core, with a typical thickness of 0.005 to 0.004 inch. (Hard metal wears much more
slowly than soft laminations.) (b) Hard solid metal, such as alphenol or sendust. (Wear rates
are much lower than those of soft metal laminations.) (2) soft core material.—(a) Soft metal
laminations bonded together to form the core, with a typical thickness of 0.0005 to 0.004
inch. (b) Usually, a high nickel/iron alloy, such as Hy Mu 800. (c) These materials have a
relatively poor wear rate.
