The voltage regulator is a tap-changing transformer, which is located, in most cases, at the supply end of the
feeder. The tap changer increases the supply voltage, which in turn increases the voltage above the allowable
minimum at the last load. The tap changer transformer has two windings. The excitation winding is connected
in parallel. The regulating winding is connected in series with the feeder. The latter has taps and a tap changer
