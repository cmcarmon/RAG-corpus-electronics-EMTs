Standard form 
 
A number  written  with  one  digit  to  the  left  of  the 
decimal point and multiplied by 10 raised to some 
power is said to be written in standard form.  Thus: 
1234 is written as 1.234 × 103 in standard form, and 
0.0456 is written as 4.56 × 10–2 in standard form. 
  When a number is written in standard form, the 
first  factor  is  called  the  mantissa  and  the  second 
factor is called the exponent. Thus the number 6.8 
× 103 has a mantissa of 6.8 and an exponent of 103.
Numbers having the same exponent can be added 
or  subtracted  in  standard  form  by  adding  or 
subtracting the mantissae and keeping the exponent 
the same.  Thus:
