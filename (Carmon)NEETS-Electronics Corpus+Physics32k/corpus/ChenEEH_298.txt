steps are identiÔ¨Åed. Beginning with VIH and examining
through graphical techniques the output characteristics, the
NMOS inverter is found to be equivalent to the CMOS
case; that is, the driver (enhancement mode) is in the linear
regime and the load (depletion mode) is in the saturation
regime. Assuming that the inverter pull-up: pull-down ratio
is k, then:
