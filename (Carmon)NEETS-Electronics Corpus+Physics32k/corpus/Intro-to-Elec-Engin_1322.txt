By employing the frequency-domain methods, one can gain insight for signal analysis and easily
interpret the results. Supposing that x(t) has a low-pass amplitude spectrum, as shown in Figure
14.2.6(a), the corresponding spectrum of the sampled signal xs(t) is depicted in Figure 14.2.6(b).
Taking Equation (14.2.7) term by term the ﬁrst term will have the same spectrum as x(t) scaled by
the factor a0; the second term corresponds to product modulation with a scale factor a1 and carrier
frequency fs, so that it will have a DSB spectrum over the range fs − W ≤ f ≤ fs + W ; the
third and all other terms will have the same DSB interpretation with progressively higher carrier
frequencies 2fs, 3fs, . . . .
