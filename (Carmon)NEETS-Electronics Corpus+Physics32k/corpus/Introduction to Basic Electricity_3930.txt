Video amplifiers are wideband amplifiers used to 
amplify video (picture) information. The frequency 
range of the video amplifier is greater than that of 
the audio amplifier, extending from a few hertz to 5 
or 6 megahertz. For example, a television requires a 
uniform bandwidth of 60 hertz to 4 megahertz. Ra-
dar requires a bandwidth of 30 hertz to 2 megahertz. 
In circuits that use sawtooth or pulse waveforms, it is 
necessary to cover a range of frequencies from 1‚ÅÑ10 of 
the lowest frequency to 10 times the highest frequency. 
The extended range is necessary because nonsinu-
soidal waveforms contain many harmonics and they 
must all be amplified equally.
