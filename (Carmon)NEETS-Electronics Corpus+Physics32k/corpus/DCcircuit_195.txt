Here, we only have 2 components excluding the wires: the battery and the resistor. Though
the connecting wires take a convoluted path in forming a complete circuit, there are several
electrically common points in the electrons’ path. Points 1, 2, and 3 are all common to each
other, because they’re directly connected together by wire. The same goes for points 4, 5, and
6.
