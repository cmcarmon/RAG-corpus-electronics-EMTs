Two auxiliary pieces of information are needed to complete
the characterization of
the HMM—the initial probability
vector, say p1, and the number of states, S. The ith element
of p1 2 RS is the probability that state i is the initial state
in any path that produces an observation string. In the left-
to-right model, the starting state is naturally taken to be
the ‘‘leftmost’’ one, ordinarily numbered ‘‘state 1.’’ Accord-
ingly, p1 ¼ 1
. Formally, then, a Moore-form
½

o
HMM, say M, is comprised of the set of elements:
