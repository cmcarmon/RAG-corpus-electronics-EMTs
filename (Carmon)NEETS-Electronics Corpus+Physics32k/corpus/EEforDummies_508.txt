signals tend to get squelched. Because the inductor passes DC and blocks 
more and more AC as frequency increases, high‐frequency input signals are 
also squelched. What happens to the in‐between frequencies? Well, some cur-
rent is allowed to pass through, with the most current flowing when the input 
signal is at one specific frequency, known as the resonant frequency.
