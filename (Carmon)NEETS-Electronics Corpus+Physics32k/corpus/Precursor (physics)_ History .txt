Precursors were first theoretically predicted in 1914 by Arnold Sommerfeld for the case of electromagnetic radiation propagating through a neutral dielectric in a region of normal dispersion. Sommerfeld's work was expanded in the following years by LÃ©on Brillouin, who applied the saddle point approximation to compute the integrals involved. However, it was not until 1969 that precursors were first experimentally confirmed for the case of microwaves propagating in a waveguide, and much of the experimental work observing precursors in other types of waves has only been done since the year 2000. This experimental lag is mainly due to the fact that in many situations, precursors have a much smaller amplitude than the signals that give rise to them (a baseline figure given by Brillouin is six orders of magnitude smaller). As a result, experimental confirmations could only be done after technology became available to detect precursors.
