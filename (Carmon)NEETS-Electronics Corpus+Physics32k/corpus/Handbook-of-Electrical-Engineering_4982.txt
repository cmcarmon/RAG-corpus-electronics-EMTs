where  n(E)  is  the  trap  density  and  n  is  the  attempt  jump  frequency  of  the  electrons.  The  electron  current
displays the usual t–1 dependence and the plot of i(t)t versus kTln(nt) yields the distribution of trap depths.
Eq. (55.14) represents an approximation, which underestimates the current associated with the shallow traps
and overcompensates for the current due to the deep traps. The mobility of the free charge carriers is determined
by  the  depth  of  the  traps,  the  ﬁeld  resulting  from  the  trapped  charges,  and  the  temperature.  As  elevated
temperatures and low space charge ﬁelds, the mobility is proportional to exp[–DH/kT] and at low temperatures
to (T)1/4 [LeGressus and Blaise, 1992]. A high trapped charge density will create intense ﬁelds, which will in
turn  exert  a  controlling  inﬂuence  on  the  mobility  and  the  charge  distribution  proﬁle.  In  polymers,  shallow
traps are of the order of 0.5 to 0.9 eV and deep traps are ca. 1.0 to 1.5 eV, while the activation energies of dipole
orientation and ionic conduction in solid and liquid dielectrics fall within the same range. It has been known
that most charge trapping in the volume occurs in the vicinity of the electrodes; this can now be conﬁrmed by
measurement, using thermal and electrically stimulated acoustical pulse methods [Bernstein, 1992]. In the latter
method this involves the application of a rapid voltage pulse across a dielectric specimen. The resulting stress
wave propagates at the velocity of sound and is detected by a piezoelectric transducer. This wave is assumed
not to disturb the trapped charge; the received electrical signal is then correlated with the acoustical wave to
determine the proﬁle of the trapped charge. Errors in the measurement would appear to be principally caused
by the electrode surface charge effects and the inability to distinguish between the polarization of polar dipoles
and that of the trapped charges [Wintle, 1990].
