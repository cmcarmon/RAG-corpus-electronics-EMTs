The fine structure energy corrections can be obtained by using perturbation theory. To perform this calculation one must add the three corrective terms to the Hamiltonian: the leading order relativistic correction to the kinetic energy, the correction due to the spin-orbit coupling, and the Darwin term coming from the quantum fluctuating motion or zitterbewegung of the electron.
These corrections can also be obtained from the non-relativistic limit of the Dirac equation, since Dirac's theory naturally incorporates relativity and spin interactions.
