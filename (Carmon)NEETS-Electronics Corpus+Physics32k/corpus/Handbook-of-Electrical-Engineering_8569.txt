High-Level Machines
Machines that directly implement the constructs of high-level languages can be easily implemented via micro-
programming. For example, Prolog machines and Lisp machines have been tried. It is also possible to conceive
an application directly microcoded. Although this could provide a high performance hardware, human errors
and software engineering practice seem to make such a machine more of a curiosity than a maintainable system.
