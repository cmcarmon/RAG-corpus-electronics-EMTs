Radio wave sources which are smaller than one radio wavelength are also generally treated as point sources. Radio emissions generated by a fixed electrical circuit are usually polarized, producing anisotropic radiation. If the propagating medium is lossless, however, the radiant power in the radio waves at a given distance will still vary as the inverse square of the distance if the angle remains constant to the source polarization.
Gamma ray and X-ray sources may be treated as a point source if sufficiently small. Radiological contamination and nuclear sources are often point sources. This has significance in health physics and radiation protection.
Examples:
Radio antennas are often smaller than one wavelength, even though they are many metres across
Pulsars are treated as point sources when observed using radio telescopes
In nuclear physics, a "hot spot" is a point source of radiation
