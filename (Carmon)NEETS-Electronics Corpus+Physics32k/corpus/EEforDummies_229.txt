For the three‚ÄêLED circuit, you need the switch to function as an on/off switch, 
so you connect two of the three SPDT terminals in your circuit. Leave the 
unused end terminal in a breadboard hole but not connected to anything in 
your circuit, as shown in Figure 4-13. With the slider positioned towards the 
unused terminal, the switch is off. With the slider positioned towards the 
other end of the switch, the switch is on.
