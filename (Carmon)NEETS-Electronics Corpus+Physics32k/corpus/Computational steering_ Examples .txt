A simple, but contrived, example of computational steering is:
In a simulated chess match with two automated players: manually forcing a certain move at a particular time for one player, to change the evolution of the game.
Some real examples of computational steering are:
In a population dynamics simulation: changing selection pressures exerted between hosts and parasites, to examine the effect on their coevolution.
In a fluid dynamics simulation: resetting the phase state of an immiscible fluid, to speed the search for its critical separation temperature.
