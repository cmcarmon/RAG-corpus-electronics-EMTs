circuit containing many sources and resistors, and one capacitor, as suggested
in Figure 10.3. Let us assume we wish to find the capacitor voltage vC. We will
use the node method described in Chapter 3 to do so. As shown in Figure 10.2a,
we take the bottom node as ground, which leaves us with one unknown node
voltage corresponding to the top node. The voltage at the top node is the same
as the voltage across the capacitor, and so we will proceed to work with vC
as our unknown. Next, according to Step 3 of the node method, we write
KCL for the top node in Figure 10.2a, substituting the constituent relation for
a capacitor from Equation 9.9,
