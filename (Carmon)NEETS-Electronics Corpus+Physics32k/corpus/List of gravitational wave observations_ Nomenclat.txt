Gravitational wave events are named starting with the prefix GW. The next two numbers indicate the year the event was observed, the middle two numbers are the month of observation and the final two numbers are the day of the month on which the event was observed. This is similar to the systematic naming for other kinds of astronomical event observations, such as those of gamma-ray bursts. Probable detections that are not confidently identified as gravitational wave events are designated LVT ("LIGO-Virgo trigger").
