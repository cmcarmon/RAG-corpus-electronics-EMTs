DT Fourier Transform
The DT Fourier transform (DTFT) is obtained directly in terms of the sequence samples s[n] by taking the
relationship  obtained  in  Eq.  (14.3)  to  be  the  deﬁnition  of  the  DTFT.  By  letting T  =  1  so  that  the  sampling
period is removed from the equations and the frequency variable is replaced with a normalized frequency w¢
= wT, the DTFT pair is deﬁned by Eqs. (14.12). In order to simplify notation it is not customary to distinguish
between w  and w¢,  but  rather  to  rely  on  the  context  of  the  discussion  to  determine  whether  w  refers  to  the
normalized (T = 1) or to the unnormalized (T „ 1) frequency variable.
