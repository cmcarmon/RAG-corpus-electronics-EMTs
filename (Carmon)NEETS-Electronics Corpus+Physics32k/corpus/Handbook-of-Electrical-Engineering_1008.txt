Some prefer to use a more global approach with BSIM, ﬁtting to measured data with ParL and ParW terms
directly. Although this is certainly possible, it is deﬁnitely not a recommended approach. It represents the worst
form of blind curve ﬁtting, with no regard for physical correctness or understanding. The BSIM model was
originally developed with the idea of obtaining the model parameters via extraction as opposed to optimization.
In  fact,  UC  Berkeley  provides  software  for  obtaining  BSIM  parameters  using  extraction  algorithms,  with  no
optimization at all. As stated previously, this has the advantage of being relatively fast and easy. Unfortunately,
it does not always work. One of the major drawbacks of the BSIM model is that certain values of the parameters
can cause the model to produce negative values of Gds in saturation. This is highly undesirable, not only from
a modeling standpoint, but also because of the convergence problems it can cause in circuit simulators. If an
extraction strategy is used that does not guarantee non-negative Gds , very little can be done to ﬁx the problem
when Gds becomes negative. Of course, the extraction algorithms can be modiﬁed, but this is difﬁcult and time
consuming. With  optimization  strategies,  one  can  weight  the  ﬁtting  for Gds  more  heavily  and  thus  force  the
model  to  produce  non-negative  Gds . We,  therefore,  do  not  favor  extraction  strategies  for  BSIM,  or  anything
else. As with most things in life, minimal effort provides minimal rewards.
