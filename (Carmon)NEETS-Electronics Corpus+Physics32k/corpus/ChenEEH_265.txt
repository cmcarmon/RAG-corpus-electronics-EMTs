Compared with conventional high-input-voltage VRM
topologies, the push-pull
forward converter has a higher
power density, faster transient response, and higher efﬁciency.
For example, compared with the forward ﬂyback shown in
Figure 1.32 and asymmetrical half-bridge shown in Figure
1.33, which are fourth-order systems, the push-pull forward
converter is a second-order system. Therefore, its control is
simpler, and its transient is faster. As a result, the output ﬁlter
inductance and capacitance needed are signiﬁcantly reduced.
Due to its reduced input current ripple, the converter’s input
ﬁlter can also be reduced.
