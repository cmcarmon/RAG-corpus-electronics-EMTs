The track radar range equation is conditioned on noise-limited angle accuracy as this measure stresses radar
capabilities signiﬁcantly more than range accuracy in almost all cases of interest. The operational requirement
is to maintain a given data rate track providing a speciﬁed single-measurement angle accuracy for a given number
of targets with speciﬁed RCS and range. Antenna beamwidth, which is proportional to the radar carrier wave-
length  divided  by  antenna  extent,  impacts  track  performance  since  the  degree  of  S/N  required  for  a  given
measurement accuracy decreases as the beamwidth decreases. Track performance requirements can be bounded as
