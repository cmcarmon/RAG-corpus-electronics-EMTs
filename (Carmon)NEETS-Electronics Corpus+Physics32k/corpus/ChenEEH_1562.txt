Compared to general-purpose programming languages,
shells provide better tools for fast design and implementation
of expert systems. An expert system shell is a programming
environment that contains the necessary utilities for both
developing and running an expert system. For example, since
an expert system shell provides a build-in inference engine,
the developer can focus on inputting problem-speciÔ¨Åc knowl-
edge into the knowledge base. By using expert system shells,
the programming skills required to build an expert system
become minimal, and the design and implementation time
can be greatly reduced.
