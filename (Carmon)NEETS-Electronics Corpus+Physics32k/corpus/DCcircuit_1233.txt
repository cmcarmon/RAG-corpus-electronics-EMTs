Superconductors also offer some strange possibilities having nothing to do with Ohmâ€™s Law.
One such possibility is the construction of a device called a Josephson Junction, which acts as
a relay of sorts, controlling one current with another current (with no moving parts, of course).
The small size and fast switching time of Josephson Junctions may lead to new computer
circuit designs: an alternative to using semiconductor transistors.
