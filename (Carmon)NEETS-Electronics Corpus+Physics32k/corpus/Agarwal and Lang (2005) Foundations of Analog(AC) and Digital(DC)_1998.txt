Chapter 12 showed that circuits containing an inductor and a capacitor could
display oscillatory behavior when the circuit was under-damped. This chapter
will show that oscillatory behavior occurs when the system function has com-
plex roots. Such systems are called resonant systems. The behavior of resonant
circuits was characterized by parameters such as their quality factor and reso-
nant frequency. This chapter revisits resonant circuits from an impedance and
frequency point of view.
