The electric power 
 is a major power system component which provides the capability of reliably
and efﬁciently changing (transforming) ac voltage and current at high power levels. Because electrical power
is proportional to the product of voltage and current, for a speciﬁed power level, low current levels can exist
only at high voltage, and vice versa.
