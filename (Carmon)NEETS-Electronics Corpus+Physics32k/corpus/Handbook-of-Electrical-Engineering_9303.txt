Program Correctness. For some relatively simple programs speciﬁcations and even veriﬁcations can be for-
malized. Unfortunately, however, formal speciﬁcation methods are not available or not sufﬁciently developed
for  most  programs  of  practical  interest,  and  the  speciﬁcations,  given  as  narratives,  are  most  likely  less  than
complete.  For  the  situations  not  explicitly  covered  by  the  speciﬁcations,  the  resulting  program  may  exhibit
bizarre behavior or simply terminate. Furthermore, informal methods of demonstrating correctness may also
miss  points  that  were,  indeed,  addressed  by  the  speciﬁcations.  The  costs  of  these  problems  may  range  from
time wasted in the workplace to injuries and loss of lives.
