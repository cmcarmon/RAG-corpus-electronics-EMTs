This section contains concise summaries of relevant topics in applied engineering mathematics and certain
key formulas, that is, those formulas that are most often needed in the formulation and solution of engineering
problems. Whereas even inexpensive electronic calculators contain tabular material (e.g., tables of trigonometric
and  logarithmic  functions)  that  used  to  be  needed  in  this  kind  of  handbook,  most  calculators  do  not  give
symbolic results. Hence, we have included formulas along with brief summaries that guide their use. In many
cases we have added numerical examples, as in the discussions of matrices, their inverses, and their use in the
solutions of linear systems. A table of derivatives is included, as well as key applications of the derivative in the
solution  of  problems  in  maxima  and  minima,  related  rates,  analysis  of  curvature,  and  Ô¨Ånding  approximate
