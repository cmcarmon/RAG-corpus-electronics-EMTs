Two demonstrator/prototype INNOVIA ART 100 cars were built and used for testing at the UTDC urban transit facility Millhaven, Ontario. Unlike the production cars, the demo cars lacked doors at either end of the vehicle. Test Vehicle 1 had windows in the centre and on the driver cab, while Test Vehicle 2 is a trailer car only had a centre window and no driver's cab. The paint scheme on the lead car was orange and white, while the trailer was grey and orange. The interior of the vehicle was unfinished (no seats, incomplete floor/ceiling and plywood panelling covering wiring). Only Test Vehicle 2 remained at the facility and in 2011 it was donated to the Canada Science and Technology Museum in Ottawa.
A mock-up of an Innovia ART 100 car was stored at the Toronto Transit Commission Wychwood Carhouse by Disney Displays. This car was unpainted and non-operational. The fate of this vehicle is unknown.
BC Rail had an Innovia ART 200 test car delivered to test clearance in stations and tunnels for the Millennium Line. It was donated by BC Rapid Transit Company to the West Coast Railway Heritage Park in Squamish, BC in 2012.
