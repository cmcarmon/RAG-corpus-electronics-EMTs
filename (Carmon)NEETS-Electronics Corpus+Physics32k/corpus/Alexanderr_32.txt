In  other  words,  an  ideal  independent  voltage  source  delivers  to  the
circuit  whatever  current  is  necessary  to  maintain  its  terminal  volt-
age.  Physical  sources  such  as  batteries  and  generators  may  be
regarded  as  approximations  to  ideal  voltage  sources.  Figure  1.11
shows the symbols for independent voltage sources. Notice that both
symbols  in  Fig.  1.11(a)  and  (b)  can  be  used  to  represent  a  dc  volt-
age  source,  but  only  the  symbol  in  Fig.  1.11(a)  can  be  used  for  a
time-varying voltage source. Similarly, an ideal independent current
source  is  an  active  element  that  provides  a  speciÔ¨Åed  current  com-
pletely independent of the voltage across the source. That is, the cur-
rent  source  delivers  to  the  circuit  whatever  voltage  is  necessary  to
maintain the designated current. The symbol for an independent cur-
rent  source  is  displayed  in  Fig.  1.12,  where  the  arrow  indicates  the
direction  of  current i.
