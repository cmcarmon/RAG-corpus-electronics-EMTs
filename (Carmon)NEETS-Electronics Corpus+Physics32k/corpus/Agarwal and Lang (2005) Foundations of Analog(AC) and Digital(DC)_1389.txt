For the case where the circuit time constant is very short compared to the
square-wave period, the exponentials go to completion relatively rapidly, as
suggested by waveform b in Figure 10.8. The capacitor waveform thus closely
resembles the input waveform, except for a small amount of rounding at the
corners.
