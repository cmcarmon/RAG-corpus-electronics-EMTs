up through the radiator, then down through the channel between the radiator and the emitter, are key features
in  the  thermal  design.  The  energy  emitted  depends  on  emitter  temperature  in  proportion  to  T4.  System
performance will clearly require a high degree of uniformity of emitter surface temperature. In this particular
system, the emitter produces a black-body spectrum. The front surface of the cell is coated with a selective ﬁlter
that  reﬂects  long-wavelength  light  back  to  the  emitter.  This  not  only  minimizes  the  cooling  load  on  the  PV
array,  but  also  returns  useful  energy  to  the  emitter,  maintaining  more  efﬁcient  energy  conversion.  The  solar
cells are made of GaSb. These usefully absorb energies to a maximum wavelength of about 1.8 µ.
