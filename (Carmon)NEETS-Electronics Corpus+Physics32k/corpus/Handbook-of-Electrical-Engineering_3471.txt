In a ﬁrst-order thermal model, it is generally appropriate to relate the heat source temperature to the average
(rather than the outlet) coolant temperature. In such calculations the ﬂow resistance should be taken to equal
one-half of the value given by Eq. (33.11). These average ﬂow resistances for the three common coolants in
electronics thermal management, i.e., air, water, and FC-72 (3M Trade Name), are shown in Figure 33.4.
