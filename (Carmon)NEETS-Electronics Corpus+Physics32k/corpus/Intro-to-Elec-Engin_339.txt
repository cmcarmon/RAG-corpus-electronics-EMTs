in which ¯VL−N is chosen as the reference for convenience. The magnitude of the line current
the power factor is lagging. By knowing that the line (or phase) currents ¯IA,
¯IC lag their
respective voltages ¯VAN ,
¯VBN , and ¯VCN by 20°, the phase angles of various voltages and currents,
if desired, can be obtained with respect to any chosen reference, such as ¯VBC.
