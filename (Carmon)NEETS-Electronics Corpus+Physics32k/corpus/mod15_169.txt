A basic dual-speed synchro system consists of two transmitters and two receivers, as shown in figure 
1-34. One transmitter receives the external input to the system and, through a network of gears, passes the 
effects of the external input to the second transmitter. The gear ratio between these two transmitters 
determines the two specific speeds the system will use to transmit the input data. The two speeds of this 
system are often referred to as fast and slow, high and low, or more often as fine and coarse.
