thin section of N- or P-type semiconductor material 
called a wafer. The wafer is then placed in an oven and 
exposed to an impurity in a gaseous state. At an ex-
tremely high temperature, the impure atoms penetrate 
or diffuse through the exposed surfaces of the wafer. 
The depth of diffusion is controlled by the length of 
the exposure and the temperature.
