DO  check  and,  if  necessary,  replace  the  internal 
batteries regularly. 
 
DO use properly insulated test leads and prods. 
 
DON’T  attempt  to  measure  resistance  in  a  circuit 
that has the power applied to it. 
 
DON’T  rely  on  voltage  readings  made  on  high-
impedance  circuits  (the  meter’s  own 
internal 
resistance  may  have  a  significant  effect  on  the 
voltages that you measure). 
 
DON’T rely on voltage and current readings made 
on  circuits  where  high-frequency  signals  may  be 
present  (in  such  cases  an  analogue  meter  may 
produce  readings  that  are  wildly  inaccurate  or 
misleading). 
 
DON’T  subject 
to  excessive 
mechanical shock or vibration (this can damage the 
sensitive meter movement). 
 
DON’T leave the instrument for very long periods 
without removing the batteries (these may leak and 
cause damage).
