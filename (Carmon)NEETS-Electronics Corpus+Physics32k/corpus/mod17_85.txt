Secondary applications of the vlf range include worldwide transmission of standard frequency and 
time signals. Standard frequency and time signals with high accuracy over long distances have become 
increasingly important in many fields of science. It is essential for tracking space vehicles, worldwide 
clock synchronization and oscillator calibration, international comparisons of atomic frequency standards, 
radio navigational aids, astronomy, national standardizing laboratories, and communications systems.
