Solution:
Consider Fig. 3.3(b), where the circuit in Fig. 3.3(a) has been prepared
for  nodal  analysis.  Notice  how  the  currents  are  selected  for  the
application of KCL. Except for the branches with current sources, the
labeling  of  the  currents  is  arbitrary  but  consistent.  (By  consistent,  we
mean  that  if,  for  example,  we  assume  that 
resistor
from the left-hand side,  must leave the resistor from the right-hand
v2
side.) The reference node is selected, and the node voltages 
are now to be determined.
