The simple circuit topology of Figure 2.30 is so common that the voltage-
divider relation given by Equation 2.48 will become a primitive in our circuit
vocabulary. It is helpful to build up a set of such primitives, which are really
solved simple cases, to speed up circuit analysis, and to facilitate intuition.
A simple mnemonic: For the voltage v2, take the resistance associated with v2
divided by the sum of the two resistances, multiplied by the voltage applied to
the pair.
