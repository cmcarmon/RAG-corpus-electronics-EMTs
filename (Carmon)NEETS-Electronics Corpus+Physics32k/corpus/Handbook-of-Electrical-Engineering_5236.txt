Generator
The generator converts mechanical energy from the turbines into electrical energy. The major components of
the  generator  are  the  frame,  stator  core  and  winding,  rotor  and  winding,  bearings,  and  cooling  system.
Figure 59.6 shows the cross section of a modern hydrogen-cooled generator.
