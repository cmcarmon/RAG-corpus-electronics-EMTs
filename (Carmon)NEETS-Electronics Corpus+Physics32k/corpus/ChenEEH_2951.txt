This section deals with fundamental basics of active microwave
circuits: noise in a microwave system and noise in active
microwave devices. As this section ﬁrst explains, at microwave
frequencies, noise is dominated by thermal and shot noise, not
1/f noise. Then, the bipolar transistor, heterojunction bipolar
transistor, ﬁeld effects transistor, high electron mobility tran-
sistor, and two-terminal microwave devices are discussed. Ex-
cellent references on these topics can be found in Fukui (1981)
and Yngresson (1991).
