The basic concept is to use the oscillator to drive current into some arbitrary two-terminal
device, and measure the resulting voltage vD and current iD. Notice that the terminal
variables for the two-terminal device, vD and iD, are defined according to the associated
variables convention. As can be seen from the circuit, the horizontal deflection will be
proportional to vD, and the vertical deflection will be proportional to vR, and hence
to iD, assuming resistor R obeys Ohmâ€™s law, and the horizontal and vertical amplifier
inputs to the oscilloscope draw negligible current.
