Clutter is the unwanted signal echo from such sources as the
sea, land, and atmosphere. It is real echo signal rather than
random noise. The ground effects on radar signals can be
divided into forward scattering and backscattering. A smooth
surface provides strong forward scattering but weak backscat-
tering, whereas a rough surface enables poor forward scatter-
ing but good backscattering.
