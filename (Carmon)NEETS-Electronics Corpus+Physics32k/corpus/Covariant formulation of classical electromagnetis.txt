Electromagnetic (EM) fields affect the motion of electrically charged matter: due to the Lorentz force. In this way, EM fields can be detected (with applications in particle physics, and natural occurrences such as in aurorae). In relativistic form, the Lorentz force uses the field strength tensor as follows.
Expressed in terms of coordinate time t, it is:

F

β






d

d
t






{\displaystyle {dp_{\alpha } \over {dt}}=q\,F_{\alpha \beta }\,{\frac {dx^{\beta }}{dt}}\,}

where pα is the four-momentum, q is the charge, and xβ is the position.
In the co-moving reference frame, this yields the 4-force

{\displaystyle {\frac {dp_{\alpha }}{d\tau }}\,=q\,F_{\alpha \beta }\,u^{\beta }}

where uβ is the four-velocity, and τ is the particle's proper time, which is related to coordinate time by dt = γdτ.
