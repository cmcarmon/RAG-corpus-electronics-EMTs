The stator windings are supplied by a DC source through power electronic switches that constitute an inverter.
Which switches are to be conducting at any time is determined by a controller, which in turn uses as inputs a
speed  or  torque  command  and  a  measurement  or  an  estimate  of  the  rotor  position.  Figure  66.26  shows  a
schematic of the motor cross-section and of the inverter.
