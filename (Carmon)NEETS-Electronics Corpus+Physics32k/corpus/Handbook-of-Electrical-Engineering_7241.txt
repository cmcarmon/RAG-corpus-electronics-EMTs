The news, however, gets even worse when it comes to maintenance. A study by the Frost and Sullivan1 group
quotes that LAN moves, adds, and changes (MACs) is the third largest cost component for LAN installation
and  hardware  maintenance.  They  state  that  MACs  account  annually  for  almost  $2  billion  of  a  $12.2  billion
LAN maintenance market, and that $2 billion does not even include the original cost to install cable.
