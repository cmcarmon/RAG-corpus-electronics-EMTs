negative to cut off the current flow. L3 tends to keep the current moving and, as its field collapses,
discharges C3. When C3 discharges sufficiently, the quadrature grid becomes positive, grid current flows,
and the cycle repeats itself. This tank circuit (L3 and C3) is tuned to the center frequency of the received
fm signal so that it will oscillate at that frequency.
