the
parallel-plate capacitor in Figure 9.11 is 1 m square, has a gap separation of 1 µm,
and is filled with a dielectric having permittivity of 2◦, where ◦ ≈ 8.854 × 10
−12 F/m
is the permittivity of free space. What is its capacitance? How much charge and energy
does it store if its terminal voltage is 100 V?
The capacitance is determined from Equation 9.4 with  = 1.8× 10
−11 F/m, A = 1 m2
−6 m. It is 18 µF. The charge is determined from Equation 9.8 with v = 100 V.
and l = 10
It is 1.8 mC. Finally, the stored energy is determined from Equation 9.18. It is 90 mJ.
