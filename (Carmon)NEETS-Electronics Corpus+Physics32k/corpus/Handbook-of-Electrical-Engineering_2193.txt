In order to bridge the gap between interactive prototyping and embedded systems, MATLAB has developed
a compiler to generate optimized C code from MATLAB code. Automatic C code generation eliminates manual
coding and algorithm recoding, thus providing a hierarchical framework for designing, simulating, and pro-
totyping DSP solutions.
