A  process  X(t)  is  completely  determined  by  its  joint  pdf’s  fX(t(1))  .  .  .  X(t (n))(x(t1),  .  .  .,  x(tn))  for  all  time
combinations t1, . . ., tn and all positive integers n (where  t(j) = tj ). When the rv’s X(t) are iid (independent,
identically distributed), then knowledge of one pdf yields the knowledge of all joint pdf’s. This is because we
can construct the joint pdf by factorization, per Eq. (73.41).
