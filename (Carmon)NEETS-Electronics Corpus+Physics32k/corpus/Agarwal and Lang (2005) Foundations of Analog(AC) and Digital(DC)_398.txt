We will analyze the circuit intuitively, applying element laws, KVL and KCL, using the
sequential approach. Looking at the input side, since the voltage source appears across
an open circuit, it is easy to see that both v0 and vIN are two volts. Similarly, both i0
and iIN are zero. Thus, we have determined all the branch variables at the input side.
