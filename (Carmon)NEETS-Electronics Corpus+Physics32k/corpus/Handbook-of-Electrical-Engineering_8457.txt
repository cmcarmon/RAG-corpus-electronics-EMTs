Given that numbers in a digital computer are represented as a string of zeros and ones and that hardware
can  perform  only  a  relatively  simple  and  primitive  set  of  Boolean  operations,  all  the  arithmetic  operations
performed are based on a hierarchy of operations that are built upon the very simple ones.
