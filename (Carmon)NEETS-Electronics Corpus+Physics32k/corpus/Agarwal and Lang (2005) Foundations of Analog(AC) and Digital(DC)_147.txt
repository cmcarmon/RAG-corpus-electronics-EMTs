Referring again to
Figure 1.15, suppose the material fabrication process undergoes a ‘‘shrink’’ to decrease
increasing the thickness H in addition to L and
each dimension (this time around,
W) by a fraction α (e.g., α = 0.8). Assume further, that the resistivity ρ changes by
. Now consider a pair of resistors with resistances R1 and
some other fraction to ρ
R2, and original dimensions L1, W1 and L2, W2 respectively, and the same thickness
H. By what fraction does the ratio of the resistance values change after the process
shrink?
