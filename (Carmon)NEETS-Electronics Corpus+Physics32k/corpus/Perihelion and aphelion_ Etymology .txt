The words perihelion and aphelion were coined by Johannes Kepler to describe the orbital motion of the planets. The words are formed from the prefixes peri- (Greek: περί, near) and apo- (Greek: ἀπό, away from) affixed to the Greek word for the sun, ἥλιος.
Perihelion and aphelion are sometimes incorrectly used for the orbits of objects about bodies other than the Sun. The correct terms are:
For orbits around the Earth: perigee and apogee.
For orbits around a star: periastron and apastron.
For orbits around any center of mass: periapsis (or pericenter) and apoapsis (or apocenter).
