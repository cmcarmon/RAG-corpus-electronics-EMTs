Figures 1.21a and b shows two possible legal definitions for ter-
minal variables for a 3 V battery. What is the value of terminal variable v in each
case?
For Figure 1.21a, we can see that terminal variable v = 3 V. For Figure 1.21b, however,
v = âˆ’3 V .
This example highlights the distinction between a terminal variable and an element
property. The battery voltage of 3 V is an element property, while v is a terminal
variable that we have defined. Element properties are usually written inside the element
symbol, or if that is inconvenient, they are written next to the element (e.g., the battery
voltage). Terminal polarities and terminal variables are written close to the terminals.
