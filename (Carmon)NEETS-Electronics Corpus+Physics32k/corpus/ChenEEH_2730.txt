As an example, assume a grid having S ¼ 0:5 and Nl ¼ 20.
Then equation 9.35b and 9.36b provide unequal ~vvp values of
0.996892c and 0.998968c, respectively. The implication is that a
sinusoidal numerical wave propagating obliquely in this grid
has a speed that is 0:998968=0:996892 ¼ 1:00208 times that of
a wave propagating along the major grid axes. This represents a
velocity anisotropy of about 0.2% between oblique and along-
axis numerical wave propagation.
