Two methods of capacitor identification are used. The first is the typographical method, and the 
second is the color code method. Typographically marked identification will be discussed first. It is the 
type marking where a number is printed on the capacitor. You should note that on different physical styles 
of capacitors, the printed number may be in either microfarads or picofarads. Two styles of capacitors 
have been selected from Military Standard 198E (MIL-STD-198E) to show how the part number stamped 
on the capacitor is broken down.
