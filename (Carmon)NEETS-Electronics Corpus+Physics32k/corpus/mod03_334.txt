Figure 2-10, view B, shows the new commercial designation for fuses. It is the same as the old
commercial designation except for the style portion of the coding. In the old commercial system, the style
was a combination of letters and numbers. In the new commercial system, only letters are used. In the
example shown, 3AG in the old system becomes AGC in the new system. Since "C" is the third letter of
the alphabet, it is used instead of the "3" used in the old system. Once again, the only way to find out the
time delay rating is to look up this coding in the manufacturerâ€™s catalog or to use a cross-reference listing.
The remainder of the new commercial designation is exactly the same as the old commercial designation.
