During the recognition phase given an incoming observa-
tion string, it is imagined that one of the trained HMMs
produced the observation string. Then, for each HMM, the
question is asked: How likely (in some sense) is it that this
HMM produced this incoming observation string? The word
associated with the HMM of highest likelihood is declared to
be the recognized word. Note carefully that it is not the pur-
pose of an HMM to generate observation strings. We imagine,
however, that one of the HMMs did generate the observation
string to be recognized as a gimmick for performing the
recognition.
