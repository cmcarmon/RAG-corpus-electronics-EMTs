The formulation of clock skew scheduling as a quadratic
programming problem is described in detail in this section.
First, the graph model introduced in Section 4.2.2 is further
analyzed in Section 4.4.1. The linear dependencies among
the clock skews and the fundamental set of cycles are intro-
duced and analyzed in Section 4.4.2. Finally, the quadratic
programming problem is formulated and solved in Section
4.4.3.
