A short circuit, other than a grounded one, is one where two conductors touch each other directly or
through another conducting element. Two conductors with frayed insulation may touch and cause a short.
Too much solder on the pin of a connector may short to the adjacent pin. In a short circuit, enough current
may or may not flow to blow a fuse or open a circuit breaker. A short may occur between two cables
carrying signals but might not be indicated by a blown fuse.
