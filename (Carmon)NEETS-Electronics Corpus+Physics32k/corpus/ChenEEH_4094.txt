After the digital symbols are converted into electrical wave-
forms, they are transmitted through a channel. During a given
signaling interval, T , a binary system transmits one of two
waveforms, denoted s1(t) and s2(t ). The signal, r(t ), received
by the receiver is represented by these two equations:
0  t  T :
