Note that the mathematical relationships between the time domain and frequency domain versions of the
same signal are termed transforms. We are transforming (in the nontechnical meaning of the word) a
signal from one representation to another. We express Fourier transform pairs as (s (t) ←→ S (f )). A
signal’s time and frequency domain representations are uniquely related to each other. A signal thus “exists”
in both the time and frequency domains, with the Fourier transform bridging between the two. We can
deﬁne an information carrying signal in either the time or frequency domains; it behooves the wise engineer
to use the simpler of the two.
