The Ô¨Årst chapter of this section provides an overview of
basic principles of signals and systems. It presents important
fundamental concepts in transforming time-domain signals
into frequency domain signals (like Fourier transform and z-
transform and their properties) and linear shit-invariant
systems and their properties.
