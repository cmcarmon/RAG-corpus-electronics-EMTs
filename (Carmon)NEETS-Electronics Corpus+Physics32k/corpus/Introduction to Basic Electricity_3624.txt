The circuit shown in Figure 36-1 represents a basic cir-
cuit that converts AC to DC. It converts the sine wave 
from the AC power source to direct current, without a 
transformer. One disadvantage with this type of circuit 
occurs when the load requires a higher or lower voltage.
Another disadvantage of this basic circuit is that one 
side of the AC power source is connected to the rectifier 
circuit and the other side is connected directly to the 
chassis of the device. This can present a serious shock 
hazard when the chassis is not isolated from the user.
