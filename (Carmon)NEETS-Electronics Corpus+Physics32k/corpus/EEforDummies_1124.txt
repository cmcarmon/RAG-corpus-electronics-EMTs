you’ve dialed up. For instance, a reading of 15.2 means 15.2 V if you’ve 
dialed a 20 V range, or 15.2 millivolts (mV) if you’ve dialed a 200 mV 
range. Most digital multimeters designed for hobbyists have what’s 
called a 3½ digit display: Its readout contains three or four digits, where 
each of the three right‐most digits can be any digit from 0 to 9, but the 
optional fourth digit (that is, the left‐most — most significant — digit) is 
limited to 0 or 1. For instance, if set to a 200 V range, such a multimeter 
can give readouts ranging from 00.0 V to 199.9 V.
