The testing of an individual module or program by the programmer who created it is normally called unit
test. Unit testing can include both black-box and white-box test cases. The efﬁciency of unit test varies with
the skill of the programmer and the size and complexity of the unit being tested. However, the observed defect
removal efﬁciency of unit testing seldom exceeds 50% and the average efﬁciency hovers around 25%. For small
projects developed by a single programmer, unit test may be the only test step performed.
