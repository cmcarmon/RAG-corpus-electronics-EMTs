A Type III board will Ô¨Årst be inverted, adhesive dispensed, SMDs placed on the bottom-side of the board,
the  adhesive  cured,  the  board  re-righted,  through-hole  components  placed,  and  the  entire  assembly  wave-
soldered.  It  is  imperative  to  note  that  only  passive  components  and  small  active  SMDs  can  be  successfully
bottom-side  wave-soldered  without  considerable  experience  on  the  part  of  the  design  team  and  the  board
assembly facility. It must also be noted that successful wave soldering of SMDs requires a dual-wave machine
with one turbulent wave and one laminar wave.
