7.3.8(c) ICEO may often be ignored at room temperature, in which case the model reduces to an
open circuit at all three terminals. Representative values for a silicon BJT at room temperature
are Vγ (junction threshold voltage) = 0.7 V, Vsat = 0.2 V, and ICEO = 0.001 mA. The one BJT
parameter that must be speciﬁed is the common-emitter current gain β, because it is subject to
considerable variation.
