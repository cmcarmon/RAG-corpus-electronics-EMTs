New Approaches to Optical Networks
The preceding conventional networks with optical data links replacing copper can improve their throughputs
thanks  to  the  increased  bandwidth  of  the  transmission  medium.  However,  a  revolutionary  improvement  in
throughput to terabit-per-second levels with gigabit-per-second access requires entirely new approaches for the
physical connectivity, architecture, and access protocols. We can use much of the photonic technology employed
in long-haul lightwave systems to provide physical connectivity, but we also need devices with new functionality
to  realize  proposed  architectures,  and,  conversely,  with  new  component  functionality  we  can  dream  of  new
architectures.
