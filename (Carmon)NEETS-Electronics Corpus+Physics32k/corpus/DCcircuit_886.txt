To help compensate for this, additional resistance can be added to each of the parallel ther-
mocouple circuit branches to make their respective resistances more equal. Without custom-
sizing resistors for each branch (to make resistances precisely equal between all the thermo-
couples), it is acceptable to simply install resistors with equal values, signiﬁcantly higher than
the thermocouple wires’ resistances so that those wire resistances will have a much smaller
impact on the total branch resistance. These resistors are called swamping resistors, because
their relatively high values overshadow or ”swamp” the resistances of the thermocouple wires
themselves:
