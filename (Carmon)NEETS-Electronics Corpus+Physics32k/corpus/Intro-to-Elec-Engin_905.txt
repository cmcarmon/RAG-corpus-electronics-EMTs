Finally, Figure 11.3.3 shows the equivalent circuit of a nonideal transformer as a combination
of an ideal transformer and of the nonideal effects of the primary winding, the core, and the
secondary winding. Note that the effects of distributed capacitances across and between the
windings are neglected here. The following notation is used:
