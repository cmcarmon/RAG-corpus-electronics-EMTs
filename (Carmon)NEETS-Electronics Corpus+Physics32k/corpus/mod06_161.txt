By applying +3 volts to the grid, the voltage drop across RL  was increased by 50 volts (from the
original 50 volts to 100 volts). In view (C), -3 volts has once again been applied to the control grid. Once
again plate current decreases to 2.5 milliamperes, and the voltage drop across RL drops to 25 volts.
