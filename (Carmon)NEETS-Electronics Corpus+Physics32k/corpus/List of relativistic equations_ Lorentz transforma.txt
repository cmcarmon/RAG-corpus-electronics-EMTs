The following notations are used very often in special relativity:
Lorentz factor




γ
=


1

1
−

β

2







{\displaystyle \gamma ={\frac {1}{\sqrt {1-\beta ^{2}}}}}

where β = v/c and v is the relative velocity between two inertial frames.
For two frames at rest, γ = 1, and increases with relative velocity between the two inertial frames. As the relative velocity approaches the speed of light, γ → ∞.
Time dilation (different times t and t' at the same position x in same inertial frame)





t
′

=
γ
t


{\displaystyle t'=\gamma t}


In this example the time measured in the frame on the vehicle, t, is known as the proper time. The proper time between two events - such as the event of light being emitted on the vehicle and the event of light being received on the vehicle - is the time between the two events in a frame where the events occur at the same location. So, above, the emission and reception of the light both took place in the vehicle's frame, making the time that an observer in the vehicle's frame would measure the proper time.
Length contraction (different positions x and x' at the same instant t in the same inertial frame)





ℓ
′

=


ℓ
γ




{\displaystyle \ell '={\frac {\ell }{\gamma }}}


This is the formula for length contraction. As there existed a proper time for time dilation, there exists a proper length for length contraction, which in this case is ℓ. The proper length of an object is the length of the object in the frame in which the object is at rest. Also, this contraction only affects the dimensions of the object which are parallel to the relative velocity between the object and observer. Thus, lengths perpendicular to the direction of motion are unaffected by length contraction.
