The model-based MMSE approach provides reasonably good enhanced speech quality with signiﬁcantly less
structured  residual  noise  than  the  spectral  subtraction  approach.  This  performance  was  achieved  for  white
Gaussian  input  noise  at  10  dB  input  SNR  using  512-2048  ﬁlters.  An  improvement  of  5–6  dB  in  SNR  was
achieved by this approach. The model-based approach, however, is more elaborate than the spectral subtraction
approach, since it involves two steps of training and estimation, and training must be performed on sufﬁciently
long data. The MMSE estimation approach is usually superior to the asymptotic MMSE enhancement approach.
The reason is that the MMSE approach applies a “soft decision” rather than a “hard decision” in choosing the
most appropriate ﬁlter for a given vector of the noisy signal.
