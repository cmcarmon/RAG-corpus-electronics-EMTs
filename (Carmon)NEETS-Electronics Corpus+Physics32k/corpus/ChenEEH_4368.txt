Note that in the preceding criterion, it is assumed that
G(s)H(s) has neither poles nor zeros on the jv axis. In this
case, the criterion is derived by considering the Nyquist con-
tour in Figure 2.3(A), which encloses the entire right half of
the s plane. When G(s)H(s) has poles and/or zeros on the jv
axis, the contour must be modiÔ¨Åed as in Figure 2.3(B).
