Improper crimping procedures eventually cause terminal failure. Be especially careful of 
undercrimping, overcrimping, using wrong crimping tools, improper cleaning methods, and cutting or 
nicking the conductors. A loose contact allows an oxide film to form between the wire and the terminal. 
This results in increased resistance, and the resistance causes heat. The heat accelerates deterioration, and 
eventually a failure results.
