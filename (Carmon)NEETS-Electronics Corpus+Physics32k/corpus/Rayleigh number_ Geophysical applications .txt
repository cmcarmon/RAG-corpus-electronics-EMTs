In geophysics, the Rayleigh number is of fundamental importance: it indicates the presence and strength of convection within a fluid body such as the Earth's mantle. The mantle is a solid that behaves as a fluid over geological time scales. The Rayleigh number for the Earth's mantle due to internal heating alone, RaH, is given by:






R

η

{\displaystyle \mathrm {Ra} _{H}={\frac {g\rho _{0}^{2}\beta HD^{5}}{\eta \alpha k}}}

where:
H is the rate of radiogenic heat production per unit mass
η is the dynamic viscosity
k is the thermal conductivity
D is the depth of the mantle.
A Rayleigh number for bottom heating of the mantle from the core, RaT, can also be defined as:

{\displaystyle \mathrm {Ra} _{T}={\frac {\rho _{0}^{2}g\beta \Delta T_{sa}D^{3}C_{P}}{\eta k}}}

where:
ΔTsa is the superadiabatic temperature difference between the reference mantle temperature and the core–mantle boundary
CP is the specific heat capacity at constant pressure.
High values for the Earth's mantle indicates that convection within the Earth is vigorous and time-varying, and that convection is responsible for almost all the heat transported from the deep interior to the surface.
