Ion Implantation
Ion implantation is normally modeled in one of two ways. The ﬁrst involves tables of moments of the ﬁnal
distribution of the ions which are typically generated by experiment. These tables are dependent on the energy
and the type of ion being implanted. The second method involves Monte-Carlo simulation of the implantation
process. In Monte-Carlo simulation the trajectories of individual ions are followed as they interact with (bounce
off) the silicon atoms in the lattice. The trajectories of the ions, and the recoiling Si atoms (which can strike
more Si atoms) are followed until all come to rest within the lattice. Typically several thousand trajectories are
