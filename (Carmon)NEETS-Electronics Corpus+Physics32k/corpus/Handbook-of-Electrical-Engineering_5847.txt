The  voltage  drop  can  be  reduced  by  the  application  of  a  shunt  capacitor. As  shown  in  Fig.  65.7,  a  properly
selected and located shunt capacitor assures that the voltage supplied to each of the customers will be within
the  allowable  limit  at  the  heavy  load  condition.  However,  at  light  load,  the  same  capacitor  will  increase  the
voltage  above  the  allowable  limit.  Most  capacitors  in  the  distribution  system  use  switches.  The  capacitor  is
switched off during the night when the load is light and switched on when the load is heavy. The most frequent
use of capacitors is on the primary feeders. In an overhead system, three-phase capacitor banks with vacuum
switches are installed on the poles. Residential underground systems require less shunt capacitance for voltage
control due to the reduced reactance. Even so, shunt capacitors are used for power factor correction and loss
reduction.
