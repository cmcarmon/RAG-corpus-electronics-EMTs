Convolutional Codes
In convolutional code, the block of n code digits generated by the encoder in a particular time unit depends
not only on the block of k message digits within that time unit but also on the block of data digits within a
previous span of N â€“ 1 time units (N >1). A convolutional encoder is illustrated in Fig. 70.3.
