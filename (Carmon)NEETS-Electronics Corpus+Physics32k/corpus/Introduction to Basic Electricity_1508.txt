open-circuit rating of approximately 1.52 volts, and an 
energy density of about 45 watt-hours per pound. The 
alkaline cell performs much better over temperature 
extremes than carbon-zinc cells. Alkaline cells per-
form best where moderate to high currents are drawn 
over extended periods of time.
