ITU-T Recommendation G.8261/Y.1361 (formerly G.pactiming) "Timing and Synchronization Aspects in Packet Networks" specifies the upper limits of allowable network jitter and wander, the minimum requirements that network equipment at the TDM interfaces at the boundary of these packet networks can tolerate, and the minimum requirements for the synchronization function of network equipment.
