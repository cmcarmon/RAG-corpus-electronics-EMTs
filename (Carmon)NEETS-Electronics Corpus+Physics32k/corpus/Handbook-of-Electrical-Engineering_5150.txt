with the result that a time-varying electric ﬁeld will modulate the refractive index, and hence a phase shift is
experienced by the light passing through the medium. In materials that have a central symmetry, this phenomenon
is called the Kerr effect; in noncentrosymmetric materials, it is referred to as Pockel’s effect [Kaminow, 1965].
