To determine a decimal number from an 8421 code 
number, break the code into groups of 4 bits. Then 
write the decimal digit represented by each 4-bit group.
EXAMPLE:â€‚ Find the decimal equivalent for each 
of the following BCD codes: 10010101, 1001000, 
1100111, 1001100101001, and 1001100001110110.
