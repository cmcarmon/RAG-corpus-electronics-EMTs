The pdf assumed in equation 10.27 applies to complex
targets consisting of many independent scatterers of equal
RCS, and the pdf assumed in equation 10.28 applies to targets
consisting of a dominant reﬂector and many small scatterers.
Pulse-to-pulse ﬂuctuation corresponds to fast ﬂuctuation, and
scan-to-scan ﬂuctuation corresponds to slow ﬂuctuation.
