In units where the mass and frequency of the oscillator are equal to one (see nondimensionalization), the energy of the oscillator is




H

(

P

X

)

.


{\displaystyle H={1 \over 2}(P^{2}+X^{2})~.}

The level sets of H are the clockwise orbits, and they are nested circles in phase space. The classical orbit with energy E is

sin

)

.


{\displaystyle X(t)={\sqrt {2E}}\cos(t),\qquad P(t)=-{\sqrt {2E}}\sin(t)~.}

The old quantum condition dictates that the integral of P dX over an orbit, which is the area of the circle in phase space, must be an integer multiple of Planck's constant. The area of the circle of radius √2E is 2πE. So

{\displaystyle E={nh \over 2\pi }~,}

or, in natural units where ħ = 1, the energy is an integer.
The Fourier components of X(t) and P(t) are simple, and more so if they are combined into the quantities

{\displaystyle A(t)=X(t)+iP(t)={\sqrt {2E}}\,e^{-it},\quad A^{\dagger }(t)=X(t)-iP(t)={\sqrt {2E}}\,e^{it}}
.
Both A and A† have only a single frequency, and X and P can be recovered from their sum and difference.
Since A(t) has a classical Fourier series with only the lowest frequency, and the matrix element Amn is the (m − n)th Fourier coefficient of the classical orbit, the matrix for A is nonzero only on the line just above the diagonal, where it is equal to √2En. The matrix for A† is likewise only nonzero on the line below the diagonal, with the same elements.
Thus, from A and A†, reconstruction yields

which, up to the choice of units, are the Heisenberg matrices for the harmonic oscillator. Note that both matrices are hermitian, since they are constructed from the Fourier coefficients of real quantities.
Finding X(t) and P(t) is direct, since they are quantum Fourier coefficients so they evolve simply with time,

The matrix product of X and P is not hermitian, but has a real and imaginary part. The real part is one half the symmetric expression XP + PX, while the imaginary part is proportional to the commutator

It is simple to verify explicitly that XP − PX in the case of the harmonic oscillator, is iħ, multiplied by the identity.
It is likewise simple to verify that the matrix
