Air-operated pinch valves generally only consist of an extremely elasticised reinforced rubber hose, a type of housing, and two socket end covers or flanges. The rubber hoses of the air operated pinch valves are usually press-fitted and centred into the housing ends by the socket end covers or flange. Since they function without any additional actuators, all they need to close or operate is a pressurized air supply into the valve body. As soon as the air supply becomes interrupted and the volume of air exhausts, the elastic rubber hose starts to open due to the force of the process flow.
