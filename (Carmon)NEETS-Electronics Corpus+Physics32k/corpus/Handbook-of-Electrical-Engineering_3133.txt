The  PT  IGBTs  cannot  be  as  easily  paralleled  as
MOSFETs. The factors that inhibit current sharing of
parallel-connected  IGBTs  are  (1)  on-state  current
(sat) distribution and main
unbalance, caused by V
circuit wiring resistance distribution, and (2) current
unbalance  at  turn-on  and  turn-off,  caused  by  the
switching time difference of the parallel connected devices and circuit wiring inductance distribution. The NPT
IGBTs can be paralleled because of their positive temperature coefÔ¨Åcient property.
