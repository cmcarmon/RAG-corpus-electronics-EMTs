Hybrid Modulations
By blending together several of the previous types of SS modulation, one can form hybrid modulations that,
depending on the system design objectives, can achieve a better performance against the interferer than can
any of the SS modulations acting alone. One possibility is to multiply several of the c(t) wideband waveforms
[now denoted by c (i)(t) to distinguish them from one another] resulting in a SS modulation of the form
