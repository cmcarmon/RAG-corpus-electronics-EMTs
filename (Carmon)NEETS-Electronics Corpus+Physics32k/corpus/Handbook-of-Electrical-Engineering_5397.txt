The alternative to selective emission is to reﬂect sub-bandgap energy back to the emitter. Several types of
ﬁlters  show  potential  for  this  task,  including  dielectric  layers,  plasma  ﬁlters,  metallic  reﬂectors  on  the  back
surface of the cell, or some combination of these. An ideal ﬁlter will have 100% transmission up to the band
edge  of  the  semiconductor  and  100%  reﬂection  for  lower  energies.  Even  very  small  absorption  losses  in  the
ﬁlter system can produce unacceptable cooling loads at typical TPV system power densities.
