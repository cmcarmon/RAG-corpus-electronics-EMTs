Proportional approval voting (PAV) is an electoral system which is an extension of approval voting to multiple-winner elections. It applies proportional representation principles with a ballot which is no more complicated than ballots for plurality voting. It allows each voter to vote for as many or as few candidates as they choose. The system was invented by Thorvald N. Thiele. It was rediscovered by Forest Simmons in 2001, who coined the name "proportional approval voting".
