To help you understand inductors, think about water flowing through a pipe 
with a turbine in it. When you first apply water pressure, the fins of the tur-
bine obstruct the flow, applying back pressure on the water. As the fins start 
to turn, they apply less back pressure, so the water flows more easily. If you 
suddenly remove the water pressure, the fins will keep turning for a while, 
pulling water along with them, until eventually the fins stop turning and the 
water stops flowing.
