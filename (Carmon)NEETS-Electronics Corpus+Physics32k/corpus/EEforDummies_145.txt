A flashlight that is off is an open circuit. In the flashlight in Figure 3-2, the flat 
black button in the lower left controls the switch inside. The switch is noth-
ing more than two flexible pieces of metal in close proximity to each other. 
With the black button slid all the way to the right, the switch is in an open 
position and the flashlight is off.
