(3.1.10)
With exponential excitation in which v(t) = Vest and i(t) = Iest, it can be seen that the following
holds good because exponential excitations produce exponential responses with the same expo-
nents. (Notationwise, note that v(t) and i(t) represent the real-valued signals, whereas v(t) and
i(t) represent complex-valued signals.)
