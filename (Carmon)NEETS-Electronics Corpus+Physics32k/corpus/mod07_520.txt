View B is a schematic diagram for the same series voltage regulator with one significant difference. 
The output voltage is shown as 14.2 volts instead of the desired 14.3 volts. In this case, the load has 
increased causing a lowered voltage drop across R L to 14.2 volts. When the output decreases, the forward 
bias of Q1 increases to 0.8 volt because Zener diode CR1 maintains the base voltage of Q1 at 15 volts. 
This 0.8 volt is the difference between the Zener reference voltage of 15 volts and the momentary output 
voltage. (15 V âˆ’ 14.2 V = 0.8 V). At this point, the larger forward bias on Q1 causes the resistance of Q1 
to decrease, thereby causing the voltage drop across Q1 to return to 5.7 volts. This then causes the output 
voltage to return to 14.3 volts.
