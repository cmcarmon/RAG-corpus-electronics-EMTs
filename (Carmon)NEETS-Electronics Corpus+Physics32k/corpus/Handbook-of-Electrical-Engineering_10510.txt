The major vehicle subsystems include propulsion, braking, power conditioning, communication, passenger
information  (audio  and  visual),  heating/air  conditioning,  door  control,  speed  control,  and  monitoring  and
diagnostics. All of these subsystems interact with each other and many also interact with subsystems external
to the vehicle.
