When the distance



d


{\displaystyle d}
between antennas is less than the transmitting antenna height, two waves are added constructively to yield bigger power. As distance increases, these waves add up constructively and destructively, giving regions of up-fade and down-fade. As the distance increases beyond the critical distance



d
c


{\displaystyle dc}
or first Fresnel zone, the power drops proportionally to an inverse of fourth power of



d


{\displaystyle d}
. An approximation to critical distance may be obtained by setting Δφ to π as the critical distance to a local maximum.
