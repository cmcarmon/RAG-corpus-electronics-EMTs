In addition to providing a conventional plot of the aircraft bomb run, the computer group automated the previously manual "bomb plot" in which technicians used time-of-flight charts for air drag and drew lengths of line from the release point to the vacuum impact point and then to an estimate impact point for drag and crosswind. By automatically using "ballistic data" such as time-of-fall to determine vacuum impact point, the AN/MSQ-35 computed bomb "score data [that was] printed out on tape" from a paper roll.
