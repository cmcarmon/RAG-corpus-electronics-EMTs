3.9 The Impedance Concept19
Rather than solving the diﬀerential equation that arises in circuits containing capacitors and inductors, let’s
pretend that all sources in the circuit are complex exponentials having the same frequency. Although this
pretense can only be mathematically true, this ﬁction will greatly ease solving the circuit no matter what
the source really is.
