The end of the catwhisker is one of the terminals of the diode. It has a low-resistance contact to the 
external circuit. A flat metal plate on which the crystal is mounted forms the lower contact of the diode 
with the external circuit. Both contacts with the external circuit are low-resistance contacts.
