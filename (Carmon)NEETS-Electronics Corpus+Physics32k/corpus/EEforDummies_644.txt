If you’re designing a transistor circuit, you need to understand how your cir-
cuit will operate under various conditions. What is the maximum amount of 
collector current your transistor will have to handle? What is the minimum 
current gain you need to amplify an input signal? How much power could 
possibly be dissipated in your transistor under extreme operating conditions 
(for instance, when the transistor is off and the entire power supply voltage 
may be dropped across the collector‐emitter)?
