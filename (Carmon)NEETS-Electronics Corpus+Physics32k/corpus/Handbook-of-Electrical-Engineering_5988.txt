the  simulations  of  the  power  supply  circuits  if  they  provide  outputs  of  these  voltages.  If  not,  as  in  the  case
where the templates of the power supply circuits also require voltages Va and vf as their inputs, the intercon-
nection  of  the  motor  and  power  supply  circuits  templates  will  require  an  interface  module  with  current  as
input and voltage as output as shown in Fig. 66.32(b).
