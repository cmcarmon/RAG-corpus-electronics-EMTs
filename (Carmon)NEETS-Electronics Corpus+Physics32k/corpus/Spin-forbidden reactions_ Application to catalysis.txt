Ligand association and dissociation from metal centers involve a fundamental change in the coordination sphere of that metal. This change in certain reactions also requires a change in spin state to occur, which can retard the rate of ligand association. Oxidative addition and reductive elimination can be thought of in a similar manner to ligand association and dissociation, respectively. Mathematically, the rate ligand dissociation can increase when the reaction proceeds from one spin state to another, although it must be noted that this effect is often small in comparison with other factors such as sterics around the metal center.
