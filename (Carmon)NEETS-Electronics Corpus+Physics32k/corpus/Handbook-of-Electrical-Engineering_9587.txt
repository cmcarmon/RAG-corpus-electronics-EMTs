Array Processors
Because of the need for interprocessor and processor-memory communication for most applications, a parallel
processor usually has one or more circuits (known as interconnection networks) to support various applications
 identical PEs under the control of a
for efÔ¨Åcient processing. In general, an 
single CU and a number of MUs. Within each PE there are circuits for network interface as well as its own
local memories. The PEs and MUs communicate with each other through an interconnection network. A typical
array processor organization is shown in Fig. 95.3. Depending on the design, each PE may perform serial-by-
bit (as in MPP) or parallel-by-bit (as in ILLIAC IV) operations.
