The characteristic of a type K thermocouple is 
defined  in  BS  4937  Part  4  of  1973  (International 
Thermocouple Reference Tables) and this standard 
gives  tables  of  e.m.f.  versus  temperature  over  the 
range 0°C to +1100°C. In order to minimize errors, 
it is usually necessary to connect thermocouples to 
appropriate signal conditioning using compensated 
cables  and  matching  connectors.  Such  cables  and 
connectors are available from a variety of suppliers 
and  are  usually  specified  for  use  with  type  K 
thermocouples. A selection of typical thermocouple 
probes  for  high  temperature  measurement  was 
shown earlier in Fig. 16.2.
