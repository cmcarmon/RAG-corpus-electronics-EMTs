Electronic tuning does not change the center frequency of the cavity, but does vary the frequency 
within the mode of operation. The amount the frequency can be varied above or below the center 
frequency is limited by the half-power points of the mode, as shown in figure 2-12. The center frequency 
can be changed by one of two methods One method, GRID-GAP TUNING, varies the cavity frequency 
by altering the distance between the grids to change the physical size of the cavity. This method varies the 
capacitance of the cavity by using a tuning screw to change the distance between the grids mechanically. 
The cavity can also be tuned by PADDLES or SLUGS that change the inductance of the cavity.
