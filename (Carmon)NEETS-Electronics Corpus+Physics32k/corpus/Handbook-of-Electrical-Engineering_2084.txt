Sonar systems, for a given set of parameters of the sonar equations, are designed so that the FOM exceeds the
acoustic propagation loss. The amount above the FOM is called the signal excess. When two sonar systems are
compared, the one with the largest signal excess is said to hold the acoustic advantage. However, it should be
noted that the set of parameters in the preceding FOM equations is not unique. Depending on the design or
parameter measurability conditions, different parameters can be combined or expanded in terms of quantities
such  as  frequency  dependency  of  the  sonar  system  in  particular  ocean  conditions,  speed  and  bearing  of  the
receiving or transmitting platforms, reverberation loss, and so forth. Furthermore, due to multipaths, differences
in sonar system equipment and operation, and the constantly changing nature of the ocean medium, the FOM
parameters  ï¬‚uctuate  with  time.  Thus,  the  FOM  is  not  an  absolute  measure  of  performance  but  rather  an
expected value of performance over time in a stochastic sense [for details, see Urick, 1983].
