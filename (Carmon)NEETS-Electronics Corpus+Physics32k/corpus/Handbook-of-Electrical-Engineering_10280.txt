medium will generally possess a higher bandwidth. The bandwidth is required to accommodate the overhead
of the additional information on the communications link for the purpose of system management. The higher
bandwidths pose a special problem for aircraft designers due to weight and electromagnetic interference (EMI)
considerations. Additional avionics are required to perform the buffering and distribution of the information
received by the aircraft. Generally a single unit, commonly identiÔ¨Åed as the communications management unit
(CMU), will perform this function.
