The metal-oxide-silicon (MOS) capacitor is at
the core
of the complementary metal-oxide-silicon (CMOS) technol-
ogy. MOSFETs rely on the extremely high quality of the inter-
face between SiO2, the standard gate dielectric, and silicon (Si).
Before presenting the MOSFET in detail, it is essential to
achieve a satisfactory understanding of the MOS capacitor
fundamentals.
