ISAB is only a factor in the period of the day where radio signals travel through the portion of the ionosphere facing the sun. The solar wind and radiation cause the ionosphere to become charged with electrons in the first place. At night, the atmosphere becomes drained of its charge, and radio signals can go much farther with less loss of signal. In particular, low frequency signals that would be attenuated to nothing during the day will be received much farther away at night.
The specific amount of attenuation can be derived as a function of the Inverse-square law. The lower the frequency, the greater the attenuation.
Relative ionospheric absorption can be measured using a riometer.
