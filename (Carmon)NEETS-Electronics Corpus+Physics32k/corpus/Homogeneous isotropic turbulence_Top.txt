Approximation used in many fluid-dynamical models, corresponding to an idealized state where the turbulent flow has two properties:
It is isotropic which means the statistical characteristics of turbulence is independent of the direction of space.
It is homogeneous which means the statistical characteristics of turbulence is independent of location of space.
