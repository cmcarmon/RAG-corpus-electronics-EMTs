If several conducting charged objects are lowered one after the other into the container and touched to the inside, all the charge on each object will be transferred to the outside of the container, regardless of how much charge is already on the container. This is the only way electrostatic charges on objects can be added together. If two conducting charged objects are simply touched together on their outside surfaces, the charge on both will merely be shared between the two objects.
This is how charge is transferred to the top terminal of a Van de Graaff generator. The terminal is a hollow metal shell and functions as a Faraday pail. Charge is transported inside it on a moving belt, then removed from the belt by a wire attached to the inside of the terminal. Since the inside of the terminal is at a constant potential, the charge from the belt flows to the outside surface, adding to the charge there, regardless of how much charge is already on the terminal.
