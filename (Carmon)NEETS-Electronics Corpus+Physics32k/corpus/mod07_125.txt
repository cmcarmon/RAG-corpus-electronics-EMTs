FORWARD BIAS.â€”An external voltage applied to a PN junction is call BIAS. If, for example, a
battery is used to supply bias to a PN junction and is connected so that its voltage opposes the junction
field, it will reduce the junction barrier and, therefore, aid current flow through the junction. This type of
bias is known as forward bias, and it causes the junction to offer only minimum resistance to the flow of
current.
