Single mode step-index fibers propagate only one mode, called the fundamental mode. Single mode
operation occurs when the value of the fiber's normalized frequency is between 0 and 2.405 (0 Â£ V <
2.405). The value of V should remain near the 2.405 level. When the value of V is less than 1, single
mode fibers carry a majority of the light power in the cladding material. The portion of light transmitted
by the cladding material easily radiates out of the fiber. For example, light radiates out of the cladding
material at fiber bends and splices.
