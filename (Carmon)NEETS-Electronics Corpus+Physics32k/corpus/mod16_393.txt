When the electrodynamometer is used as an ammeter, a special type of construction must be used.
This is because the large currents that flow through the meter cannot be carried through the moving coils.
In the ammeter in view B of figure 3-17, stationary coils a and b are wound of heavier wire to carry up to
5.0 amperes. An inductive shunt (XL) is wired in parallel with the moving coils and permits only a small
part of the total current to flow through the moving coil. The current flowing through the moving coil is
directly proportional to the total current flowing through the instrument. The shunt has the same ratio of
reactance to resistance as the moving coil does. Therefore, the instrument will be reasonably correct at
frequencies at which it is used if ac currents are to be measured.
