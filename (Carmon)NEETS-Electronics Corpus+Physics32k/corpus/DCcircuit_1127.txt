Yet another type of special-purpose ”battery” is the chemical detection cell. Simply put,
these cells chemically react with speciﬁc substances in the air to create a voltage directly pro-
portional to the concentration of that substance. A common application for a chemical detection
cell is in the detection and measurement of oxygen concentration. Many portable oxygen ana-
lyzers have been designed around these small cells. Cell chemistry must be designed to match
the speciﬁc substance(s) to be detected, and the cells do tend to ”wear out,” as their electrode
materials deplete or become contaminated with use.
