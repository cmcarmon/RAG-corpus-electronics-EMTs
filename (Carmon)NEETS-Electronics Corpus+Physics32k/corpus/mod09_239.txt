As you have just studied, a basic oscillator can be broken down into three main sections: a 
frequency-determining device, an amplifier, and a feedback circuit. The frequency-determining device in 
an LC oscillator is usually an LC tank circuit. Although the tank circuit is normally found in the input 
circuit of an oscillator (both electron tube and transistor), it sometimes appears in the output circuit. The 
differences in magnitude of plate and collector currents and shunting impedances are considerations in the 
designed locations of such tank circuits. In both solid-state and electron tube circuits, oscillations take 
place in the tuned circuit. Both the electron tube and the transistor function primarily as electrical valves 
that amplify and automatically deliver to the input circuit the proper amount of energy to sustain 
oscillations. In both tube and transistor oscillators, the feedback circuit couples energy of the proper 
amount and of the correct phase from the output to the input circuit to sustain oscillations.
