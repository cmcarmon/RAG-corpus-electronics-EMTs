Creating a budget for a project requires keep-
ing a list of all components and estimated costs 
for PCB  fabrication (Figure 47-9). The schematic 
diagram is helpful in developing the components 
list, and an  Internet search can produce the cost for 
a PCB fabrication when it is not being fabricated 
in-house.
