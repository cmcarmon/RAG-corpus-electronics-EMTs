Cylindrical Conﬁguration
The cylindrical conﬁguration consists of one vertical revolute joint and
two orthogonal linear joints (RPP), as shown in Fig. 101.3. The resulting
work  envelope  of  the  robot  is  a  cylindrical  annulus,  as  shown  in
Fig. 101.4. This conﬁguration corresponds with the cylindrical coordi-
nate system.
