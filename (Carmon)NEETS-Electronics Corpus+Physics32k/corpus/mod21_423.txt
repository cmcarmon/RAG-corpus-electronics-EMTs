A variety of methods and test equipments may be used to measure the voltage or current distribution
along a transmission line. An open transmission line is accessible for coupling to many types of voltage-
measuring devices, such as a wavemeter or a grid-dip meter. However, at higher frequencies where
coaxial cables or waveguides are used to minimize skin effect losses, (discussed in NEETS, module 10)
access is more complicated. Access to the interior of the waveguide or center conductor of the coaxial
cable must be gained by using a unidirectional or bidirectional coupler, which is inserted into the
transmission line. The coupler contains a slot into which an rf probe is inserted and positioned with
respect to directivity.
