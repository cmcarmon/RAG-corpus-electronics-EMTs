When the input to this circuit is at zero potential, the diode is forward biased because of the zero
potential on the cathode and the positive voltage on the anode. In this condition, the diode conducts and
acts as a straight piece of wire because of its very low forward resistance. In effect, the input is directly
coupled to the output resulting in zero volts across the output terminals. Therefore, the diode, acts as a
closed switch when its anode is positive with respect to its cathode.
