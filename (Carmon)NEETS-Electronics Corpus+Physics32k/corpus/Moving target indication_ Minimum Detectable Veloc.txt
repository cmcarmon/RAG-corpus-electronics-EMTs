The MDV comes from the frequency spread of the mainlobe clutter. MDV determines whether traffic will be detected. A GMTI radar must distinguish a moving target from ground clutter by using the target’s Doppler signature to detect the radial component of the target’s velocity vector (i.e., by measuring the component of the target’s movement directly along the radar-target line). To capture most of this traffic, even when it is moving almost tangentially to the radar (i.e., perpendicular to the radar-target line), a system must have the ability to detect very slow radial velocities. As the radial component of a target’s velocity approaches zero, the target will fall into the clutter or blind zone. This is calculated as:

{\displaystyle MDV={\frac {\lambda }{2}}\left({\frac {4v_{p}}{B}}{\sqrt {(\sin(AZ)\sin(EL))^{2}+(\cos(AZ)\cos(EL))^{2}}}\right)}

Any target with a velocity less than this minimum (MDV) cannot be detected because there is not sufficient Doppler shift in its echo to separate it from the mainlobe clutter return.
