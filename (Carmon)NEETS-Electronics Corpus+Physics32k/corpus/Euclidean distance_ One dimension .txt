In the context of Euclidean geometry, a metric is established in one dimension by fixing two points on a line, and choosing one to be the origin. The length of the line segment between these points defines the unit of distance and the direction from the origin to the second point is defined as the positive direction. This line segment may be translated along the line to build longer segments whose lengths correspond to multiples of the unit distance. In this manner real numbers can be associated to points on the line (as the distance from the origin to the point) and these are the Cartesian coordinates of the points on what may now be called the real line. As an alternate way to establish the metric, instead of choosing two points on the line, choose one point to be the origin, a unit of length and a direction along the line to call positive. The second point is then uniquely determined as the point on the line that is at a distance of one positive unit from the origin.
The distance between any two points on the real line is the absolute value of the numerical difference of their coordinates. It is common to identify the name of a point with its Cartesian coordinate. Thus if x and y are two points on the real line, then the distance between them is given by:

In one dimension, there is a single homogeneous, translation-invariant metric (in other words, a distance that is induced by a norm), up to a scale factor of length, which is the Euclidean distance. In higher dimensions there are other possible norms.
