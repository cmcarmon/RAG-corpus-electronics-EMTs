The availability of a satellite to act as a relay station between two earth terminals depends on the 
locations of the earth terminals and the orbit of the satellite. All satellites, except those in a synchronous 
orbit, will be in view of any given pair of earth stations only part of the time. The length of time that a 
nonsynchronous satellite in a circular orbit will be in the ZONE OF MUTUAL VISIBILITY (the satellite 
can be seen from both terminals) depends upon the height at which the satellite is circling. Elliptical orbits 
cause the satellite zone of mutual visibility between any two earth terminals to vary from orbit to orbit. 
These times of mutual visibility are predictable. Figure 4-14 illustrates the zone of mutual visibility.
