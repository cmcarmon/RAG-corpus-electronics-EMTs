The ASCR has a similar forward blocking capability as an inverter-grade thyristor, but it has a limited reverse
blocking (about 20â€“30 V) capability. It has an on-state voltage drop of about 25% less than an inverter-grade
thyristor  of  a  similar  rating.  The ASCR  features  a  fast  turn-off  time;  thus  it  can  work  at  a  higher  frequency
than an SCR. Since the turn-off time is down by a factor of nearly 2, the size of the commutating components
can be halved. Because of this, the switching losses will also be low.
