Suppose the transmitter rotor is turned counterclockwise 60ยบ, as shown in view A of figure 1-17. The 
TX rotor is now aligned with S1. This results in maximum magnetic coupling between the TX rotor and 
the S1 winding. This maximum coupling induces maximum voltage in S1. Because S1 is connected to S3 
of the TR, a voltage imbalance occurs between them. As a result of this voltage imbalance, maximum 
current flows through the S3 winding of the TR causing it to have the strongest magnetic field. Because 
the other two fields around S2 and S1 decrease proportionately, the S3 field has the greatest effect on the 
resultant TR stator field. The strong S3 stator field forces the rotor to turn 60ยบ clockwise into alignment 
with itself, as shown in view B. At this point, the rotor of the TR induces canceling voltages in its own 
stator coils and causes the rotor to stop. The system is now in correspondence. Notice that by reversing S1 
and S3, both synchro rotors turn the same amount, but in OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.
