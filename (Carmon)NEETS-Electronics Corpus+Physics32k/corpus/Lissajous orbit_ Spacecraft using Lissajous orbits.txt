Several missions have used Lissajous orbits: ACE at Sun–Earth L1, SOHO at Sun-Earth L1, DSCOVR at Sun–Earth L1, WMAP at Sun–Earth L2, and also the Genesis mission collecting solar particles at L1. On 14 May 2009, the European Space Agency (ESA) launched into space the Herschel and Planck observatories, both of which use Lissajous orbits at Sun–Earth L2. ESA's current Gaia mission also uses a Lissajous orbit at Sun–Earth L2. In 2011, NASA transferred two of its THEMIS spacecraft from Earth orbit to Lunar orbit by way of Earth-Moon L1 and L2 Lissajous orbits. China's lunar orbiter Chang'e 2 left lunar orbit on June 8, 2011 and was placed in a Lissajous orbit at Earth-Sun L2 until mid-2012 prior to leaving Earth orbit entirely to fly by the asteroid 4179 Toutatis.
