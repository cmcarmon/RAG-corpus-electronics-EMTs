describing some basic notions of discrete-time and continu-
ous-time signals and systems. The emphasis is on discrete-
time signals and systems, but notions for the two cases are
presented in parallel. The exposition of the continuous-time
case is deliberately brief because the similarity in the notions
should be evident to the reader. The concepts of sampling and
quantization that relate continuous- and discrete-time signals
are brieï¬‚y discussed toward the end of the chapter.
