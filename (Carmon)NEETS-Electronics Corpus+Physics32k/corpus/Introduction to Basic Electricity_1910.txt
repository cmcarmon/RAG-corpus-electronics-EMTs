The internal resistance of the ammeter adds to the 
circuit and increases the total resistance of the cir-
cuit. Therefore, the measured circuit current can be 
slightly lower than the actual circuit current. How-
ever, because the resistance of an ammeter is usually 
minute compared to the circuit resistance, the error is 
ignored.
