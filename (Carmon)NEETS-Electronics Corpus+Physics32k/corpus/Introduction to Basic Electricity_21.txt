A	circuit	can	be	either	simple	or	complex,	and	be	both	simple	and	complex.	If	the
circuit	in	subject	is	a	series	circuit,	with	a	group	of	10	different	circuits	that	are
connected	to	it	or	if	the	said	circuit	is	just	a	basic	closed	circuit	with	5	different
stops,	it	can	be	rather	confusing	to	trace.	However,	if	you	dissect	any	circuit,	youâ€™ll
discover	3	constant,	integral	components.
