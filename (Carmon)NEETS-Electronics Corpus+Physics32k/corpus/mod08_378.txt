Figure 3-17 is the open-loop frequency-response curve. You have been told that most operational
amplifiers are used in a closed-loop configuration. When you look at the frequency-response curve for a
closed-loop configuration, one of the most interesting and important aspects of the operational amplifier
becomes apparent: The use of degenerative feedback increases the bandwidth of an operational amplifier
circuit.
