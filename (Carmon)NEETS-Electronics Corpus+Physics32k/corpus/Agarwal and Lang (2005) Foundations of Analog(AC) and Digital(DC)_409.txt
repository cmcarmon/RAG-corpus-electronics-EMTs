b) Show that energy is conserved in this network.
p r o b l e m 2.14 Assume that you have an arbitrary network of passive two-
terminal resistive elements in which the i
v characteristic of each element does not
touch either the v-axis or the i-axis, except that each i
v characteristic passes through
the origin. Prove that all branch currents and branch voltages in the network are zero.
