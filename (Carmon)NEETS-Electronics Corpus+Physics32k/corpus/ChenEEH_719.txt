An alternative approach is to lower the application demand
in terms of peak bandwidth. Lowering the peak bandwidth
does not have to affect the overall application performance or
functionality. Tool support is then needed to fully exploit this.
Note also that the larger the available cycle budget, the more
freedom exists to optimize the memory access ordering.
Hence, the cycle budget (or performance) can be traded off
for energy reduction.
