To measure resistance, set the selector switch to the 
desired resistance range. Short the test leads together. 
Rotate the zero-ohm control until the pointer indicates 
zero ohms. Separate the test leads and connect them 
across the component being measured. For measur-
ing resistance between 0 and 200 ohms, use the R 3 1 
range. To measure resistance between 200 and 20,000 
ohms, use the R 3 100 range. For resistance above 
20,000 ohms, use the R 3 10,000. When measuring 
resistance in digital and semiconductor circuits, do 
not use the R 3 1 scale. This scale is energized by a 
9 V battery and could damage the circuitry. Observe 
the reading on the ohm scale at the top of the meter 
scales. Note that the ohm scale reads from right to left. 
To determine the actual resistance value, multiply the 
reading by the factor at the switch position. The letter 
K equals 1000.
