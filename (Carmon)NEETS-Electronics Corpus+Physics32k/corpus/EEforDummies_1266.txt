The 555 timer chip is used in astable mode to generate a low‐frequency 
square‐wave pulse on output pin 3. Note that the value of capacitor C1 is 
100 μF — much larger than the C1 value used to control the light chaser 
 circuits in the previous section. The larger the capacitance, the longer it 
takes to charge the capacitor, and the longer it takes to trigger the 555 chip
