The random instrumentation measurement errors in the angle estimator are caused by phase and amplitude
errors of the antenna illumination function. In reﬂector systems, such errors occur because of the position of
the  feedhorn,  differences  in  electrical  length  between  the  feed  and  the  monopulse  comparator,  mechanical
precision of the reﬂector, and its mechanical rotation. In phased array radars, these errors are a function of the
phase shifters, time delay units, and combiners between the antenna elements and the monopulse comparator
as  well  as  the  precision  of  the  array. Although  these  errors  are  random,  they  may  have  correlation  intervals
considerably longer than the white noise considered in the thermal-noise random error and may depend upon
