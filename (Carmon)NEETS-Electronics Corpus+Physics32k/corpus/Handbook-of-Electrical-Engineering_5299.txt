Worldwide deployment of geothermal plants reached 5000 MW by 1987 in 17 countries. Nearly one-half of
this  was  in  the  United  States.  The  Geysers  plant  north  of  San  Francisco  is  the  largest  in  the  world  with  an
installed capacity of 516 MW. In some developing countries, the Philippines for example, geothermal plants
supply nearly 20% of their electrical needs.
