When two ttys are connected by communications wire or cable (over short or long distances), the 
exchange of information between them is direct. When the teletypewriters are not physically joined, 
exchange of information is more involved. Direct-current mark and space intervals cannot be sent through 
the air. The gap between the machines must be bridged by radio using a radio transmitter and receiver. 
The transmitter produces a radio frequency carrier wave to carry the mark and space intelligence. A 
KEYER is needed to change the dc pulses from the tty into corresponding mark and space modulation for 
the carrier wave in the transmitter. The radio receiver and a CONVERTER are required to change the 
radio frequency signal back to dc pulses.
