This system works well when the detected object is stationary. It is used in aircraft altimeters which
give a continuous reading of the height above the earth of the aircraft. The system is not satisfactory for
locating moving objects. This is because moving targets produce a frequency shift in the returned signal
because of the Doppler effect; this affects the accuracy of the range measurement.
