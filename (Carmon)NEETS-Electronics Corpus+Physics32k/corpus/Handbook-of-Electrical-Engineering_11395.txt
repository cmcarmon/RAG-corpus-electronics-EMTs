Because f l = c, the higher the frequency the smaller is l and DL. The smaller DL, the better the lateral resolution
near the focus, but the beam spread is greater with distance from the focus. Thus, the strength of the focusing
varies among transducers so that the user may choose very good resolution over a short region or somewhat
poorer resolution that is maintained over a greater depth. With phased array transducers, the focal region can
be varied dynamically to optimize lateral resolution at all distances.
