Integrated circuit logic devices 
 
The  task  of  realizing  a  complex  logic  circuit  is 
made  simple  with  the  aid  of  digital  integrated 
circuits.  Such  devices  are  classified  according  to 
the  semiconductor 
their 
fabrication  (the  logic  family  to  which  a  device 
belongs  is  largely  instrumental  in  determining  its 
operational 
as  power 
consumption, speed, and immunity to noise). 
  The relative size of a digital integrated circuit (in 
terms  of  the  number  of  active  devices  that  it 
contains)  is  often  referred  to  as  its  scale  of 
integration  and  the  terminology  in  Table  10.5  is 
commonly used.
