Irwin was the first to observe that if the size of the plastic zone around a crack is small compared to the size of the crack, the energy required to grow the crack will not be critically dependent on the state of stress (the plastic zone) at the crack tip. In other words, a purely elastic solution may be used to calculate the amount of energy available for fracture.
The energy release rate for crack growth or strain energy release rate may then be calculated as the change in elastic strain energy per unit area of crack growth, i.e.,




G

{\displaystyle G:=\left[{\cfrac {\partial U}{\partial a}}\right]_{P}=-\left[{\cfrac {\partial U}{\partial a}}\right]_{u}}

where U is the elastic energy of the system and a is the crack length. Either the load P or the displacement u are constant while evaluating the above expressions.
Irwin showed that for a mode I crack (opening mode) the strain energy release rate and the stress intensity factor are related by:

{\displaystyle G=G_{I}={\begin{cases}{\cfrac {K_{I}^{2}}{E}}&{\text{plane stress}}\\{\cfrac {(1-\nu ^{2})K_{I}^{2}}{E}}&{\text{plane strain}}\end{cases}}}

where E is the Young's modulus, ν is Poisson's ratio, and KI is the stress intensity factor in mode I. Irwin also showed that the strain energy release rate of a planar crack in a linear elastic body can be expressed in terms of the mode I, mode II (sliding mode), and mode III (tearing mode) stress intensity factors for the most general loading conditions.
Next, Irwin adopted the additional assumption that the size and shape of the energy dissipation zone remains approximately constant during brittle fracture. This assumption suggests that the energy needed to create a unit fracture surface is a constant that depends only on the material. This new material property was given the name fracture toughness and designated GIc. Today, it is the critical stress intensity factor KIc, found in the plane strain condition, which is accepted as the defining property in linear elastic fracture mechanics.
