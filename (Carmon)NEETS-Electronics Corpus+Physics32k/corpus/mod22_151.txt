Some of the advantages of semiconductor storage are fast internal processing speeds, high reliability, 
low power consumption, high density (many circuits), and low cost. However, there is a drawback to this 
type of storage. It is volatile, which means all data in memory is lost when the power supply is removed. 
Should the power on your computer fail and you have no backup power supply, all the stored data is lost. 
This is not the case with magnetic core storage. Core storage is nonvolatile. This means the data is 
retained even if there is a power failure or breakdown, since the cores store data in the form of magnetic 
charges rather than electric current.
