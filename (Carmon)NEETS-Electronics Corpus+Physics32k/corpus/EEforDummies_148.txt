Short circuits are another matter entirely. 
A short circuit is a direct connection 
between two points in a circuit that aren’t 
supposed to be directly connected, such 
as the two terminals of a power supply. 
(See Figure 3-4.) As you discover in 
Chapter 5, electric current takes the path 
of least resistance, so in a short circuit, 
the current will bypass other parallel 
paths and travel through the direct con-
nection. (Think of the current as being 
lazy and taking the path through which it 
doesn’t have to do much work.)
