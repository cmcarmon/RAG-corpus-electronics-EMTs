Folio 2 contains two images on each of the two pages along with commentary on the following: gravity, powder amount vs. shot diameter, center of gravity for pyramids, and round balances.
In the first paragraph, Leonardo restates his theory on gravity and expands on it to say that the motion caused by gravity acts in the direction of the imaginary line between the two object's centers. He goes on to say that motion due to gravity is only caused because the objects have no way to resist gravity.
Leonardo then goes on to talk about the relation between the amount of powder and the size of ball. He writes that the amount of powder needed is proportional to the diameter of the ball. Expanding on that, he comes up with the amount of powder needed is "directly proportional to the square of the diameter".
The center of gravity of a pyramid is written to lie "in the third point along of its length toward the base". He uses this geometry to explain how to find the center of gravity of a semicircle. If one were to divide the semicircle into pyramids whose bases were almost straight, then by finding the center of gravity of those pyramids one could find the center of gravity for the semicircle.
The last page of folio 2 talks about rounded balances and how they react to gravity. Leonardo writes that if a balance was suspended in its center of gravity, then it would not move or oscillate, regardless of position. He then goes on to say that if there are two weights of equal mass on the ends of this balance, then, when moved from its starting position, the balance will never return to the starting position. After this, he theorizes that a balance in this same situation will move if one of the weights is along a straighter line of descent as compared to the other weight. He then disproves his theory by showing the balance and weights as symmetrically equal, meaning there is no reason for the balance to move.
