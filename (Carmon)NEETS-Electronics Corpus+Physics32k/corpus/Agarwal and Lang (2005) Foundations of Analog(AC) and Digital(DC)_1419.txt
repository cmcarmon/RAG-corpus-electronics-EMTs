In the simple example shown in Figure 10.16, the propagation delay
through the inverter for a low to high transition at the input, tpd,0→1, is also
equal to the rise time of the output of the inverter. Similarly, tpd,1→0, is also
equal to the fall time of the inverter output. The rise and fall times are properties
of output terminals of circuits, while propagation delays measure the relative
