Usability testing is a technique used in user-centered interaction design to evaluate a product by testing it on users. This can be seen as an irreplaceable usability practice, since it gives direct input on how real users use the system. It is a measure of how fast a user can perform given tasks to test the efficiency and intuitiveness of a product.
