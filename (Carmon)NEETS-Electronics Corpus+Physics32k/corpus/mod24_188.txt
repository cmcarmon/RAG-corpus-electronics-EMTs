BENDING LOSS.â€”Bending the fiber also causes attenuation. Bending loss is classified according
to the bend radius of curvature: microbend loss or macrobend loss. Microbends are small microscopic
bends of the fiber axis that occur mainly when a fiber is cabled. Macrobends are bends having a large
radius of curvature relative to the fiber diameter. Microbend and macrobend losses are very important loss
mechanisms. Fiber loss caused by microbending can still occur even if the fiber is cabled correctly.
During installation, if fibers are bent too sharply, macrobend losses will occur.
