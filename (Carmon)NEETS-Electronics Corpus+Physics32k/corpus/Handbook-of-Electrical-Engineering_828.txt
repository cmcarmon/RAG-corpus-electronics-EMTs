therefore, the eigenvalues are l1 = jw and l2 = â€“jw. Both eigenvalues have single multiplicities, and Re l1 = Re
l2 = 0. Hence, the conditions of Part 2 are satisfied, and therefore the equilibrium state is stable. The conditions
of Part 3 do not hold. Consequently, the system is not asymptotically stable.
