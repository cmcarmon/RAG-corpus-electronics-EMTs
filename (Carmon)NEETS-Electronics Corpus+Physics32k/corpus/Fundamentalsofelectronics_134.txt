Recall that each element’s current and voltage must obey the convention that positive current is deﬁned to
enter the positive-voltage terminal. With this convention, a positive value of vkik corresponds to consumed
power, a negative value to created power. Because the total power in a circuit must be zero (P = 0), some
circuit elements must create power while others consume it.
