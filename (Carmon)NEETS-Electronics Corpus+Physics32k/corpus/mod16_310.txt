COIL MOVEMENT.â€”As we discussed previously, the deflecting (moving) force on the coil is
proportional to the current flowing through the coil. This deflecting force tends to cause the coil to rotate
against the restraining force of the hairsprings. When the deflecting force and the restraining force are
equal, the coil and the pointer stop moving. As we have just stated, the deflecting force is proportional to
the current in the coil, the angle (amount) of rotation is proportional to the deflecting force; therefore, the
angle of rotation is proportional to the current through the coil. When current stops flowing through the
coil, the deflecting force stops, and the restoring force of the springs returns the pointer to the zero
position.
