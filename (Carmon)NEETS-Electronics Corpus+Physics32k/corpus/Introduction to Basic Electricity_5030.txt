The Gerber format is a standard printed cir-
cuit board format supported by virtually all layout 
software. The Gerber files define the trace place-
ment, but they don’t specify the physical sizes. The 
 aperture file specifies the physical sizes with a 
short list of “flash codes.” Additionally, the Gerber 
files don’t specify the actual size of the holes to be 
drilled in the printed circuit board. The drill file 
informs the manufacturer of where the holes are 
and what size they are supposed to be. Drilling and 
etching are two separate procedures. When these 
files are sent, they include a short “read me” file 
that relates the file names to the physical parts of 
the printed circuit board to save time and reduce 
confusion.
