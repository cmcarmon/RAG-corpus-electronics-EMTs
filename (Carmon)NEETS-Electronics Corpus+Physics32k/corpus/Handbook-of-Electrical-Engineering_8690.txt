Address error: An exception (error interrupt) caused by a programâ€™s attempt to access unaligned words or
longwords  on  a  processor  which  does  not  accommodate  such  requests.  The  address  error  is  detected
within the CPU. This contrasts with problems which arise in accessing the memory itself, where a logic
circuit  external  to  the  CPU  itself  must  detect  and  signal  the  error  to  cause  the  CPU  to  process  the
exception. Such external problems are called bus errors.
