The attenuation constant adie can be found directly from Eq. (37.63) simply by generalizing the dielectric
wavenumber k to include the effect of the dielectric conductivity s. For a lossy dielectric, the wavenumber is
given  by  k2  =  w2me[1  +  (s/jwe)].  Thus,  from  Eqs.  (37.62)  and  (37.63)  the  attenuation  constant  adie due  to
dielectric losses is given by
