In homogeneous and isotropic solids, there are two kinds of waves, pressure waves and shear waves. The velocity of a shear wave,



(

v

s


)


{\displaystyle (v_{s})}
is controlled by the shear modulus,





v

s


=



G
ρ





{\displaystyle v_{s}={\sqrt {\frac {G}{\rho }}}}

where
G is the shear modulus




ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
is the solid's density.
