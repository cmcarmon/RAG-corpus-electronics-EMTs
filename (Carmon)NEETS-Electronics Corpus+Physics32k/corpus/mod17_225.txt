C1 is an emitter bypass capacitor. Resistors R1 and R2 develop emitter bias for the amplifier. C2
provides dc isolation between the tank and the base of transistor Q1. You should recall from your studies
of NEETS, Module 7, Introduction to Solid-State Devices and Power Supplies, and Module 8,
Introduction to Amplifiers, that amplifier gain may be varied by changing bias. Potentiometer R2, the rf
gain control, is nothing more than a manual bias adjustment. When the wiper arm of R2 is set at point B,
minimum forward bias is applied to the transistor. This causes the amplifier to operate closer to cutoff and
reduces gain. When you move the control toward point A, the opposite occurs. R1 limits the maximum
conduction of Q1 when R2 is short circuited. You may run into an alternate biasing method when the
transistor is operated near saturation. In that case, a large change in gain would again be a function of
bias.
