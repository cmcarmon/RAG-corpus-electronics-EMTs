As ionized material follows the Sun's magnetic field lines, due to the effect of the field lines being frozen in the plasma, the charged particles feel a force

B



{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =q\mathbf {v} \times \mathbf {B} }

where



q


{\displaystyle q}
is the charge,




v



{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} }
is the velocity and




B



{\displaystyle \mathbf {B} }
is the magnetic field vector. This bending action forces the particles to "corkscrew" around the magnetic field lines while held in place by a "magnetic pressure"

, or "energy density", while rotating together with the Sun as a solid body:

Since magnetic field strength decreases with the cube of the distance there will be a place where the kinetic gas pressure

{\displaystyle P_{g}}
of the ionized gas is great enough to break away from the field lines:

{\displaystyle P_{g}=nmv^{2}}

where n is the number of particles, m is the mass of the individual particle and v is the radial velocity away from the Sun, or the speed of the solar wind.
The magnetic field strength as a function of radius can be approximated as:

{\displaystyle B(r)={\frac {D_{\odot }}{r^{3}}}}

The critical distance where the material will break away from the field lines can then be calculated as the distance where the kinetic pressure and the magnetic pressure are equal, i.e.
