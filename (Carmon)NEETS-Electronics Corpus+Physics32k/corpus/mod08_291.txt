By now, you should be familiar with some amplifier circuits, which should give you an idea of what
a difference amplifier is like. In NEETS, Module 7, you were shown the basic configurations for transistor
amplifiers. Figure 3-1 shows two of these configurations: the common emitter and the common base.
