It is important to emphasize that a state-variable analysis introduces no new
physics. Rather it offers only an alternative analysis of the same circuit. To see
this for the previous example, note that the substitution of Equation 12.254 into
Equation 12.253 to eliminate vC yields W W W Equation 12.201. Thus, the state
equations predicts the same circuit behavior as found previously in Section 12.6.
To close this section, it is valuable to identify the similarities and differences
of the node and state-variable analyses. To begin,
it is again important to
emphasize that both analyses predict the same behavior for any given circuit.
The main difference is that they do so in terms of different sets of variables, and
through different mathematical mechanics. A node analysis does so in terms of
the node voltages, and often results in a single high-order differential equation.
A state-variable analysis does so in terms of the states, and results in a set of
coupled first-order differential equations. For this reason, if the initial conditions
for a circuit analysis are expressed in terms of the states, then the state-variable
analysis will make easier use of that information. Further, a coupled set of
first-order differential equations is more likely to be compatible with typical
numerical analysis packages. On the other hand, it is often the node voltages,
defined with respect to a common ground, that are most easily measured in an
experiment. Thus, both sets of variables are useful.
