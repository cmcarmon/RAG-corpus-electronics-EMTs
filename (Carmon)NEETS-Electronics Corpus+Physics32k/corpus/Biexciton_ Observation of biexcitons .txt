Three possibilities of observing biexcitons exist:
(a) excitation from the one-exciton band to the biexciton band (pump-probe experiments);
(b) two-photon absorption of light from the ground state to the biexciton state;
(c) luminescence from a biexciton state made up from two free excitons in a dense exciton system.
