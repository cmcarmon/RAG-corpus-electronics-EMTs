Inductive pumps use both sides of the piston to pump and suction simultaneously. This means that both sides of the pump piston are always experiencing the inlet pressure at a minimum until the pressure cycle that would exceed the inlet pressure. This may be interpreted as meaning the net head pressure in a close circuit, at the beginning of a stroke cycle, is always zero. Therefore, inductive pumps may be used in very high pressure closed circuits to circulate liquids at very low differential pressures. Essentially the inductive pump does not have to overcome the closed system pressure in order to move liquid in the system. This results in far less use of energy to move liquid with the circuit. This also provides additional circulation without any dynamic seals that could eventually leek to the outside of the system.
Additionally inductive pumps may also be connected in series to approximately double the pressure while not increasing the volume. They may also be connected in parallel to approximately double the volume while not increasing the pressure. Most positive displacement pumps cannot increase output pressure when placed in series as they both stop when they reach their max operating pressure. The inductive pumps add to each other due to the zero differential seen on the second pump from the first pump.
