Sample-and-hold systems are primarily used to maintain a constant magnitude representing the input, across
sample-and-hold
the input of the ADC throughout a precisely known period of time. Such systems are called 
ampliﬁers
 (SHA), and their characteristics are crucial to the overall system accuracy and reliability of digital

data. The SHA is not an essential item in applications where the analog input does not vary more than 
of voltage. As the name indicates, a SHA operates in two different modes, which are digitally controlled. In the
sampling  mode  it  acts  as  an  input  voltage  follower,  where,  once  it  is  triggered  into  its  hold  mode,  it  should
ideally retain the signal voltage level at the time of the trigger. When it is brought back into the sampling mode,
it instantly assumes the voltage level at the input.
