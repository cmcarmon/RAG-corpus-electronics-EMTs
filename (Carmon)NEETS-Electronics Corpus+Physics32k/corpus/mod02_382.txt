Solution: When no angles are given, you Must always solve for a known angle first. The ratio B\C is
the cosine of the unknown angle ; therefore 74.2/100 or 0.742, is the cosine of the unknown angle.
Locating 0.742 as a cosine value in the table, you find that it is the cosine of 42.1º . That is, � = 42.1º .
With  known, side A is solved for by use of the sine ratio A/C. The sine of 42.1º , according to the table,
is 0.6704. Therefore, side A is 100 × 0.6704, or 67.04 feet long.
