Identifying conductors and insulators
Materials (such as copper, silver, aluminum, and other metals) containing 
loosely bound outer electrons are called electrical conductors, or simply 
conductors. Copper is a good conductor because it contains a single loosely 
bound electron in the outermost reaches of its electron cloud. Materials that 
tend to keep their electrons close to home are classified as electrical insula-
tors. Air, glass, paper, and plastic are good insulators, as are the rubber‚Äêlike 
polymers that are used to insulate electrical wires.
