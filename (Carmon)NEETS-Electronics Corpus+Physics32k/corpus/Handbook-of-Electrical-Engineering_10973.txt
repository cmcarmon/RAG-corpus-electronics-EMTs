The  strength-frequency  curve  follows  a  U-shaped  function,  with  a  minimum  at  mid  frequencies  and  an
upturn at both low and high frequencies. At low frequencies the slow rate of change of the sinusoid prevents
the membrane capacitance from building up a depolarizing voltage because membrane capacitance is coun-
teracted by membrane leakage. This process describes the neural property known as accommodation, i.e., the
adaptation of a nerve to a slowly varying or constant stimulus. The high-frequency upturn occurs because of
the  canceling  effects  of  a  current  reversal  on  the  membrane  voltage  change.  An  empirical  Ô¨Åt  to  strength-
frequency curves is
