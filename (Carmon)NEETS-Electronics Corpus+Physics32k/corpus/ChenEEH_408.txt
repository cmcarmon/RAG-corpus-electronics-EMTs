Operational Simulation or Signal-Flow Graph
Implementation of LC Ladders
As mentioned earlier, in the SFG simulation of an LC ladder
ﬁlter, each inductor and capacitor are interpreted as signal-
ﬂow integrators that can be implemented by an RC/op-amp
circuit. The method is completely general in that it permits
arbitrary ladder arms to be realized, but in this chapter, we
shall illustrate the procedure only on low-pass ladders.
