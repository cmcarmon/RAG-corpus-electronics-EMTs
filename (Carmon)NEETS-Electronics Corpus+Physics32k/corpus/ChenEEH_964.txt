the circuit C that contains the registers R1 through R5. It is
possible to apply a clock schedule to S that speciÔ¨Åes a clock
delay t 1
cd to the register R1. However, the timing information
for the local data path R6?R1 is not considered when sched-
uling the clock signal delays to the registers in C (including
t 1
cd). Therefore, a timing violation may occur on the local data
path R6?R1 illustrated in Figure 4.13.
