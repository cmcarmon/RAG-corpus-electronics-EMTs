The  international	society	of	Certified	elec-
tronics	technicians	(isCet) (Figure 2-2) trains, 
prepares, and tests technicians in the electronics and 
appliance service industry. The Certified	electronics	
technician	(Cet)	Program, founded in 1965, mea-
sures the degree of knowledge and technical skills of 
working electronics technicians. This voluntary certifi-
cation enables employers to separate knowledgeable job 
applicants from those with less training and fewer skills.
The CET program protects consumers by certify-
ing, in the absence of governmental licensing, that the 
technician repairing their products has the knowledge, 
skills, and experience to do the job. The CET program 
has increased acceptance by technicians and employ-
ers as well as the public. Many employers encourage 
and some even require their technicians to be certified.
Electronics technicians who have passed any of the 
ISCET CET exams are encouraged to apply for mem-
bership in ISCET.
