The lower-case letter ”i” symbolizes instantaneous current, which means the amount of
current at a speciﬁc point in time. This stands in contrast to constant current or average
current (capital letter ”I”) over an unspeciﬁed period of time. The expression ”dv/dt” is one
borrowed from calculus, meaning the instantaneous rate of voltage change over time, or the
rate of change of voltage (volts per second increase or decrease) at a speciﬁc point in time,
the same speciﬁc point in time that the instantaneous current is referenced at. For whatever
reason, the letter v is usually used to represent instantaneous voltage rather than the letter
e. However, it would not be incorrect to express the instantaneous voltage rate-of-change as
”de/dt” instead.
