A current flowing through a conductor produces a magnetic field around that conductor. If the
conductor is formed into a coil, a stronger magnetic field is set up. The relationship between the strength
of the field and the intensity of the current causing it is expressed by the inductance of the coil (or
conductor). When the current producing the magnetic field ceases, the energy of the magnetic field is
returned in part to the circuit source in the form of a reverse current. Inductance, then, is the ability of a
coil to function as a storehouse of energy in magnetic form and is determined by the shape and
dimensions of the coil. Inductance is measured in henries, millihenries, or microhenries. Inductors can be
described generally as circuit elements used to introduce inductive reactance into ac circuits.
