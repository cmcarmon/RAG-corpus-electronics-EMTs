Use  a  high-speed  drill  for  drilling  all  holes 
 (Figure 48-23). Use a backer board under the printed  
circuit board to avoid breakout of the backside. A 
number 59 drill bit is used for all holes. Holes that 
need to be drilled larger are then drilled. Burrs that 
form around the holes can be removed by hand using 
a larger drill bit and a twisting motion (Figure 48-24).
If the printed circuit boards are going to be soldered 
using a wave soldering station, a solder mask is applied 
to the bottom of the board. The solder mask allows the 
solder to flow on only the points that require solder. 
The solder mask can be screenprinted on the printed 
circuit board at this time.
