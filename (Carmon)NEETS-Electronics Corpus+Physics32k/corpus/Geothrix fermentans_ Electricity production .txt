Small amounts of electricity are produced by G. fermentans during respiration via the flow of electrons facilitated by endogenous electron-shuttling compounds. Electricity can be generated in "microbial fuel cells" which harness this flow of electrons from the bacterial cell to an anode. The advantage G. fermentans has by being able to reduce Fe(III) from a distance in a natural setting does not translate into an advantage in microbial fuel cells. Once the electrons have been transferred from the shuttling compound to the anode, the compound is free to diffuse back to the cell, but great distances may cause the compound to be lost to the environment. The possibility of compound loss coupled with the great amount of energy needed to produce these compounds does not add up to efficient electricity yield when compared to those DIRB that require direct contact with the electron acceptor. The bacteria such as Geobacter sulfurreducens that are in direct contact with electrodes showed higher total power outputs in several studies, but G. fermentans has a mechanism that has the potential to cover lost ground. By secreting amounts of the unidentified electron shuttle around the cell, accumulation of the compound over time in the environment enhances electron transfer and helps to prevent compound and electron loss.
