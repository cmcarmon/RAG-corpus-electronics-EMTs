Using the jittered samples in the cardinal series results in an interpolation that is not an unbiased estimate
of x(t). Indeed, if the probability density function of the jitter is the same at all sample locations, the expected
value of the jittered interpolation is the convolution of x(t) with the probability density function of the jitter.
This bias can be removed by inverse Ô¨Åltering at a cost of decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio of the interpolation
[Marks, 1993].
