During the period when U.S. vehicles usually had only three forward speeds and the steering column was the most common shifter location, this layout was sometimes called "three on the tree". In contrast, high-performance cars, and European vehicles in general, mostly used a four-speed transmission with floor-mounted shifters. This layout was then referred to as "four on the floor".
Most FR (front-engined, rear-wheel drive) vehicles have a transmission that sits between the driver and the front passenger seat. Floor-mounted shifters are often connected directly to the transmission. FF (front-engined, front-wheel drive) vehicles, RR (rear-engined, rear-wheel drive) vehicles and front-engined vehicles with rear-mounted gearboxes often require a mechanical linkage to connect the shifter to the transmission.
