The world’s most powerful digital signal processor, the TMS320C6x, performs at an unprec-
edented 1600 million-instructions-per-second (MIPS). MIPS are the key measure of a chip’s
capacity for executing signal processing tasks. This DSP delivers ten times the MIPS perfor-
mance of any other DSP in history. The TMS320C6x is the ﬁrst programmable DSP to adopt
an advanced Very Long Instruction Word (VLIW) architecture which increases the parallel
execution of instructions by packing up to eight 32-bit instructions into a single cycle. The
VLIW architecture, combined with the most efﬁcient C compiler ever developed, dramatically
improves performance and helps reduce the code development time.
