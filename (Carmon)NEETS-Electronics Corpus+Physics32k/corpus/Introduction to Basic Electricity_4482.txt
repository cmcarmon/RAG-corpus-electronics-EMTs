Figure 44-10 shows the output waveform of the 
flip-flop. Notice that the Q output is high (1) after ev-
ery odd clock pulse and low (0) after every even clock 
pulse. Therefore, when the output is high, an odd 
number of clock pulses have occurred. When the out-
put is low, either no clock pulses or an even number of 
clock pulses has occurred. In this case, it is not known 
which has occurred.
