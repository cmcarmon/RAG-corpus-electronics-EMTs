Thus,  the  quantization  levels  need  to  be  midway  between  the  reconstruction  levels,  and  the  reconstruction
levels are at the centroid of that portion of pf ( f ) between di and fd+1 . Unfortunately these requirements do not
lead to an easy solution. Max used an iterative numerical technique to obtain solutions for various quantization
levels assuming a zero-mean Gaussian input signal. These results and the quantization levels for other standard
amplitude distributions can be found in Jain [1989].
