3.5 Power Dissipation in Resistor Circuits11
We can ﬁnd voltages and currents in simple circuits containing resistors and voltage or current sources. We
should examine whether these circuits variables obey the Conservation of Power principle: since a circuit is
a closed system, it should not dissipate or create energy. For the moment, our approach is to investigate
ﬁrst a resistor circuit’s power consumption/creation. Later, we will prove that because of KVL and KCL
all circuits conserve power.
