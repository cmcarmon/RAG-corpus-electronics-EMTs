Generalized N-way Wilkinson power divider/combiner can be
easily constructed in a similar manner. The only problem is
that it requires crossover-bridged resistors if N > 2, which
makes realization difÔ¨Åcult in planar form (Maurin and Wu,
1996). In some cases, the design of Wilkinson power divider or
combiner may not need a resistor of isolation. This is particu-
larly the case with binary (corporate) power dividers or com-
biners for antenna feeding networks and may require a
symmetrical and balanced topology. The bandwidth in this
application, however, is relatively narrow.
