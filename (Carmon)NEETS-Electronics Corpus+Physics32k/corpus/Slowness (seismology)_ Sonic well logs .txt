, made during wireline logging are used to determine sonic velocities of the wallrock in boreholes. The tool used has sources and receivers that are in contact with the wellbore and it measures the delay between the source being triggered and the signal being received. The measurements are normally in the units of microseconds per foot and are recorded on the well log.
