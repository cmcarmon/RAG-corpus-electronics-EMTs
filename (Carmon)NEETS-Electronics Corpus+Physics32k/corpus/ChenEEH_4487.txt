Here, x(t) is a 2n-dimensional state vector, k(t,x) is an
m-dimensional input vector, w(t) is aq -dimensional distur-
bance vector of Brownian motions, y(t) is a p-dimensional
vector of output measurements, and v(t) is an r-dimensional
output noise vector of Brownian motions that affect the meas-
urements being taken.
