When the ﬁrst- and second-order statistics do not change over time, we call the noise a weakly (or wide-
t = m is constant for all  t, and (2) RNN(t, t + t) =
sense) stationary process. This means that: (1) E[N(t)] = m
E[N(t)N(t + t)] = E[N(0)N(t)] = RNN(t) for all t [see Brown, 1983, p. 82; Gardner, 1990, p. 108; or Peebles,
1987, p. 153 for properties of RNN(t)]. In this case the autocorrelation function depends only on the offset t.
We assume hereafter that m = 0 (we can subtract m, which does not change the autocorrelation). When t = 0,
RNN(0) = E[N(t)N(t + 0)] = E[(N(t))2] = s
2 , which is the ﬁxed variance of each random variable Nt for all t.
Weakly stationary (ws) processes are the most commonly encountered cases and are the ones considered here.
Evolutionary processes have statistics that change over time and are difﬁcult to analyze.
