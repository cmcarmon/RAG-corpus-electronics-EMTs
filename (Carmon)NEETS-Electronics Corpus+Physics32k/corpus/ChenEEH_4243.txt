Embedded Radios
There is also a long-term trend toward, for want of a better
term, embedded radios. This trend is comparable to the trend
in microelectronics that is resulting in computer chips being
installed in such ordinary items as automobiles, washing ma-
chines, sewing machines, and other consumer appliances and
ofﬁce equipment. Radios are even being installed in humans in
the form of pacemakers and heart monitors. These devices are
less visible than personal computers, computer workstations,
and mainframe computers, but their impact on everyday life is
signiﬁcant nevertheless.
