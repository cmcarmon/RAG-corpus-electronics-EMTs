Low-Frequency Performance
In Fig. 24.32 both a source and a load have been added to the hybrid-p equivalent circuit to model the complete
CE  stage  of  Fig.  24.29.  Here,  both  Cb9e  and  Cb9c  have  been  omitted  because  they  are  too  small  to  affect  the
low-frequency performance, as has rb9c because it is large and so neither loads the source signiﬁcantly compared
to rbb¢ + rb9e nor applies much feedback.
