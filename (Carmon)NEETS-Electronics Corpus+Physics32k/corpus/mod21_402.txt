In the early 1950s, the frequency counter was developed. The device could measure and accurately 
indicate frequencies up to 10 MHz. Present-day frequency counters can accurately read frequencies as 
high as 40 GHz. In addition to direct frequency measurement indication, some types of frequency 
counters can measure the WAVE PERIOD, which is the inverse of frequency; RATIO, which compares 
one frequency against another; and TIME INTERVAL, the time between two events or the time between 
two functions of an event. In addition, frequency counters can totalize event indications. This is similar to 
measuring the frequency except that a manual or an electronic start-stop gate controls the time over which 
the measurement is taken. Frequency counters can also provide scaling in the form of a digital output 
signal from the frequency counter that represents a frequency-related division of the input frequency.
