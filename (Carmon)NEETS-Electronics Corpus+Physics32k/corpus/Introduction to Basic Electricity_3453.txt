hybrid	integrated	circuits are formed using 
monolithic, thin-film, thick-film, and discrete compo-
nents. This allows for a high degree of circuit complex-
ity by using monolithic circuits while taking advantage 
of extremely accurate component values and toler-
ances with the film techniques. Discrete components 
are used because they can handle relatively large 
amounts of power.
