more suitable system. Increasing the speed of a single-speed system from 1-speed to 36-speed provides 
greater accuracy, but the self-synchronous feature of the 1-speed system is lost. If primary power is 
interrupted in a 36-speed system and the transmitter is turned before power is reapplied, the synchros 
could realign themselves in an erroneous position. The number of positions in which the transmitter and 
receiver rotors can correspond is the same as the transmission speed. Thus, in the 36-speed system, there 
are 35 incorrect positions and only 1 correct position of correspondence.
