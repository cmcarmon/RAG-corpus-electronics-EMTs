In propeller aircraft an overspeed will occur if the propeller, ordinarily connected directly to the engine, is forced to turn too fast by high-speed airflow while the aircraft is in a dive, moves to a flat pitch in cruising flight due to a governor failure or feathering failure, or becomes decoupled from the engine.
In jet aircraft an overspeed results when the axial compressor exceeds its maximal operating rotational speed. This often leads to the mechanical failure of turbine blades, flameout and complete destruction of the engine.
In vehicles an engine can be forced to turn too quickly by changing to an inappropriately low gear.
Most unregulated engines will overspeed if power is applied with no or little load.
In the event of diesel engine runaway (caused by it inhaling an unwanted external source of fuel), a diesel engine will overspeed if the condition is not quickly rectified.
