Pulsewidth-Modulated Converters
These converters employ square-wave pulsewidth modulation to achieve voltage regulation. The average output
voltage is varied by varying the duty cycle of the power semiconductor switch. The voltage waveform across
the  switch  and  at  the  output  are  square  wave  in  nature  [refer  to  Fig. 30.13(b)]  and  they  generally  result  in
higher switching losses when the switching frequency is increased. Also, the switching stresses are high with
the generation of large electromagnetic interference (EMI), which is difﬁcult to ﬁlter. However, these converters
are easy to control, well understood, and have wide load control range.
