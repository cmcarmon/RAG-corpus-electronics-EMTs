It is clear from this discussion that CAD tools for MEMS
vary widely in the materials parameters and mechanisms that
they include, the details of design and simulation of devices,
and the fabrication facilities with which they interface. The
choice of which software to use for MEMS design and simula-
tion is still challenging.
