Toward the close of the 19th century, experimenters began to notice the peculiar characteristics of
the chemical element SELENIUM. They discovered that in addition to its rectifying properties (the ability
to convert ac into dc), selenium was also light sensitive-its resistance decreased with an increase in light
intensity. This discovery eventually led to the invention of the photophone by Alexander Graham Bell.
The photophone, which converted variations of light into sound, was a predecessor of the radio receiver;
however, it wasnâ€™t until the actual birth of radio that selenium was used to any extent. Today, selenium is
an important and widely used semiconductor.
