The dc value can be increased further by adding a low-pass ﬁlter in cascade with the output. The usual form
of  this ﬁlter is a shunt capacitor or an LC ﬁlter as shown in Fig. 5.5. The resonant frequency of  the LC ﬁlter
should be lower than the fundamental frequency of the rectiﬁer output for effective performance. The ac portion
of the output signal is reduced while the dc and rms values are increased by adding the ﬁlter. The remaining
ac portion of the output is called the  ripple. 
Though somewhat confusing, the transformer, diodes, and ﬁlter
are often collectively called the rectiﬁer circuit.
