Good  resistance  matching  is  required  to  have  good  common-mode  rejection  of  unwanted  common-mode
signals (static, 60-Hz hum, etc.). The one-ampliÔ¨Åer circuit of Fig. 27.16 has a differential input impedance of
2R1. R1 may be chosen to provide a good load for a microphone, phono-pickup, etc.
