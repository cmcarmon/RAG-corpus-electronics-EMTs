The laser beam’s concentrated light delivers energy only where it is focused. For example, a tightly focused
laser  beam  can  write  a  spot  on  a  light-sensitive  material  without  exposing  the  adjacent  area,  allowing  high-
resolution printing. Similarly, the beam from a surgical laser can be focused onto a tiny spot for microsurgery,
without heating or damaging surrounding tissue. Lenses can focus the parallel rays in a laser beam to a much
smaller spot than they can the diverging rays from a point source, a factor that helps compensate for the limited
light-production efﬁciency of lasers.
