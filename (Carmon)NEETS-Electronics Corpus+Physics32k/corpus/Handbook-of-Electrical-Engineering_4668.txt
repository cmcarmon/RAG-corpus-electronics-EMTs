time and frequency response for a uniform transducer and the associated frequency-dependent conductance
and Hilbert transform susceptance. The simple impulse model treats each electrode as an ideal impulse; however,
the electrodes have a ﬁnite width which distorts the ideal impulse response. The actual SAW potential has been
shown  to  be  closely  related  to  the  electrostatic  charge  induced  on  the  transducer  by  the  input  voltage.  The
problem is solved assuming a quasi-static and electrostatic charge distribution, assuming a semi-inﬁnite array
of electrodes, solving for a single element, and then using superposition and convolution. The charge distri-
bution solution for a single electrode with all others grounded is deﬁned as the basic charge distribution function
(BCDF). The result of a series of arbitrary voltages placed on a series of electrodes is the summation of scaled,
time-shifted  BCDFs.  The  identical  result  is  obtained  if  an  array  factor,  a(x),  deﬁned  as  the  ideal  impulses
localized at the center of the electrode or gap, is convolved with the BCDF, often called the element factor. This
is very similar to the analysis of antenna arrays. Therefore, the ideal frequency transfer function and conductance
given by the impulse response model need only be modiﬁed by multiplying the frequency-dependent element
factor. The analytic solution to the BCDF is given in Datta [1986] and Morgan [1985], and is shown to place
a  small  perturbation  in  the  form  of  a  slope  or  dip  over  the  normal  bandwidths  of  interest.  The  BCDF  also
predicts the expected harmonic frequency responses.
