Redraw the circuit, substituting the equivalent 
 resistance for the parallel portion of the circuit. See 
Figure 13‑25.
Now determine the total series resistance for the  redrawn 
circuit.
Given 
 R1 5 20 V
 RA 5 16.7 V
 R4 5 30 V
eXaMPLe:	 Calculate the total resistance for the 
 circuit shown in Figure 13‑26.
First find the equivalent resistance (RA) for parallel 
 resistors R2 and R3. Then find the equivalent resistance 
(RB) for resistors R5, R6, and R7.
