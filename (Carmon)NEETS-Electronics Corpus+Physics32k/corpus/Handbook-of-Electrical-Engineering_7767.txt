Each track has its own read and write head operated independently from other tracks [see Fig. 80.17(b)].
Tracks 1 to 8 are used for data and track nine for the parity bit. Data is written on the tape in rows of magnetized
islands, using for example EBCDIC (Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code).
