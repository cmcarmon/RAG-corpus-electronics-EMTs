Consider  Fig. 85.9,  which  depicts  a  single  (hypothetical)  integrated  circuit  (IC)  component  and  shows  its
internal circuitry which uses four NAND gates. The nodes of the circuit are numbered 1 through 12 and the
external pins of the component are labeled A, B, and  C. To detect if node 7 is stuck at logic 0 (i.e., 7/0), a test
pattern must be found that sets node 7 (and hence, node 5) to the logic 1 state. This can be achieved by setting
either or both of the external pins A and B to the logic 0 state. Furthermore, to observe (or deduce) the value
of node 7 at the only externally visible circuit pin, C, it is necessary to create a condition where the logic state
of node 12 becomes dependent on the value of node 7. The only path from node 7 to node 12 passes through
node 10, and since node 10 is the output of a NAND gate the second input to that gate (i.e., node 6) must be
set to the logic 1 state by setting input pin A to the logic 1 state. Therefore, the only possible test pattern for
7/0 is A = 1 and B = 0. At this point, we must still continue the analysis to see if indeed node 12 will reï¬‚ect
the value of node 7. With input terminals A and B set to logic 1 and logic 0, respectively, node 9 will be set to
logic 0, which causes node 11 to become logic 1. With these settings, the value at node 12 will be determined
by the value at node 10 and the test pattern is valid. Table 85.2 shows the values of all circuit nodes when this
test pattern is applied to the circuit of Fig. 85.9.
