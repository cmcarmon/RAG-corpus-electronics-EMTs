The step-invariant and impulse-invariant techniques perform a time domain matching of the analog and
digital  ﬁlters  but  can  produce  aliasing  in  the  frequency  domain.  For  frequency-selective  ﬁlters  it  is  better  to
attempt matching frequency responses. This task is complicated by the fact that the analog ﬁlter response is
deﬁned for an inﬁnite range of frequencies (W = 0 to ¥), while the digital ﬁlter response is deﬁned for a ﬁnite
range of frequencies (w = 0 to p). Therefore, a method for mapping the inﬁnite range of analog frequencies
W into the finite range from w = 0 to p, termed the bilinear transform, is employed.
Bilinear Transform Design of IIR Filters
Let Ha(s) be the Laplace transform transfer function of an analog ﬁlter with frequency response Ha(j W). The
bilinear transform method obtains the digital ﬁlter transfer function H(z) from Ha(s) using the substitution
