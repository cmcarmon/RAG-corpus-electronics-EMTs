3.4.2 Kirchhoﬀ’s Voltage Law (KVL)
The voltage law says that the sum of voltages around every closed loop in the circuit must equal zero. A
closed loop has the obvious deﬁnition: Starting at a node, trace a path through the circuit that returns you
to the origin node. KVL expresses the fact that electric ﬁelds are conservative: The total work performed
in moving a test charge around a closed path is zero. The KVL equation for our circuit is
