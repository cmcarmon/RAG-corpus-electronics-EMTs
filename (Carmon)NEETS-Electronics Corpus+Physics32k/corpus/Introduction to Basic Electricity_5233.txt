Conformal coatings protect electronic printed cir-
cuit boards from abrasion, corrosion, dust, fungus, 
moisture, and environmental stresses. Common con-
formal coatings include acrylic, epoxy, parylene, sili-
cone, and urethane. Most conformal coatings consist of 
a synthetic resin developed in a volatile solvent. When 
they are properly applied to a clean surface, the solvents 
evaporate, leaving a thin film of solid resins. Confor-
mal coatings have one or more of the following charac-
teristics to protect the printed circuit board effectively:
  1.  Good thermal heat conductivity to carry heat
