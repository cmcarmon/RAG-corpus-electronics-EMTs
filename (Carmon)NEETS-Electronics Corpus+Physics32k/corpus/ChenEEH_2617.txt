Field Displacement Isolators
The ﬁeld displacement
isolators are based on the fact
that ﬁeld proﬁles of forward and reverse waves can be quite
different in transmission lines, such as waveguides, when
loaded with a biased ferrite. Such a distinct nonreciprocal
behavior can be used to construct ﬁeld displacement isolators.
As shown in Figure 7.44 for a TE10 waveguide ﬁeld displace-
ment isolator, the largest electric ﬁeld of the reverse wave
is located at the ferrite slab where the electric ﬁeld of the
forward wave has a negligible level. If a thin resistive sheet is
introduced in this position, the forward wave will be essentially
unaffected while the reverse wave will be greatly attenuated.
This is the operating principle of the ﬁeld displacement
isolators.
