You have studied that a linear impedance is one in which the resulting current is directly 
proportional to a change in the applied voltage. A nonlinear impedance is one in which the resulting 
current is not directly proportional to the change in the applied voltage.  View (A) of figure 1-8 illustrates 
a circuit which contains a nonlinear impedance (Z), and view (B) shows its voltage-current curve.
