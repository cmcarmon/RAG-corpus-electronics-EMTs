A simple, intuitive motivation of the conductance quantum can be made using the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which states that the minimum energy-time uncertainty is ΔEΔt ~ h, where h is the Planck constant. The current I in a quantum channel can be expressed as e/τ, where τ is transit time and the e is electron charge. Applying a voltage V results in an energy E = eV. If we assume that the energy uncertainty is of order E and the time uncertainty is of order τ, we can write ΔEΔt ~ (eV)(e/I) ~ h. Using the fact that the electrical conductance G = I/V, this becomes G ~ e2/h.
