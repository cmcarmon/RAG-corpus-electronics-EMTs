The frequencies present in a signal can be conveniently represented by a graph of the frequency 
spectrum, shown in figure 1-38. In this graph, each individual frequency is portrayed as a vertical line. 
The position of the line along the horizontal axis indicates the frequency of the signal. The height of the 
frequency line is proportional to the amplitude of the signal. The rf spectrum in figure 1-38 shows the 
frequencies present when heterodyning occurs between frequencies of 5 and 100 kilohertz.
