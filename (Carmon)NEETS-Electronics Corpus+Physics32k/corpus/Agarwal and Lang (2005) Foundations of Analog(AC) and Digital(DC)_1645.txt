Figure 11.20 shows the situation where the input signal is low (second half cycle) and
the load capacitor is charging up through the on resistance of the PFET. Figure 11.21
shows the situation where the input signal is high (first half cycle) and the load capacitor
discharges to ground through the on resistance of the NFET.
