A system connection may require either a fiber optic splice, connector, or coupler. One type of
system connection is a permanent connection made by splicing optical fibers together. A fiber optic splice
makes a permanent joint between two fibers or two groups of fibers. There are two types of fiber optic
splices--mechanical splices and fusion splices. Even though removal of some mechanical splices is
possible, they are intended to be permanent. Another type of connection that allows for system
reconfiguration is a fiber optic connector. Fiber optic connectors permit easy coupling and uncoupling of
