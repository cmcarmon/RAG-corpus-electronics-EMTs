For multiple resistances in parallel, the amount of current flowing through 
any given branch is inversely proportional to the resistance in that branch. In 
practical terms, the higher the resistance, the less current goes that way; the 
lower the resistance, the more current goes that way. Just like water, electric 
current favors the path of least resistance.
