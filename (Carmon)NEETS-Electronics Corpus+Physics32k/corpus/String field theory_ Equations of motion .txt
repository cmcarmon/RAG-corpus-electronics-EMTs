Because the string field

{\displaystyle \Psi }
is an infinite collection of ordinary classical fields, these equations represent an infinite collection of non-linear coupled differential equations. There have been two approaches to finding solutions: First, numerically, one can truncate the string field to include only fields with mass less than a fixed bound, a procedure known as "level truncation". This reduces the equations of motion to a finite number of coupled differential equations and has led to the discovery of many solutions. Second, following the work of Martin Schnabl  one can seek analytic solutions by carefully picking an ansatz which has simple behavior under star multiplication and action by the BRST operator. This has led to solutions representing marginal deformations, the tachyon vacuum solution and time-independent D-brane systems.
