In most simple metals, like aluminium, the screening effect strongly reduces the electric field of the ions in the solid. The electrostatic potential is expressed as




V
(

)
=

q
r




{\displaystyle V(r)={\frac {Ze}{r}}e^{-qr}}

where Z is the atomic number, e is the elementary unit charge, r is the distance to the nucleus of the embedded ion and q is a screening parameter that determines the range of the potential. The Fourier transform,




U


G





{\displaystyle U_{\mathbf {G} }}
, of the lattice potential,

{\displaystyle V({\mathbf {r}})}
, is expressed as

When the values of the off-diagonal elements
