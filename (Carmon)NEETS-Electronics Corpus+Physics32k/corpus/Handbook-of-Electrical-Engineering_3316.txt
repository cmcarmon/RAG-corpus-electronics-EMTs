Detectors, Photoemissive
In the photoemissive effect, light falls onto a surface (photocathode) and the light energy causes electrons to
be emitted. These electrons are then collected at a positively biased anode. There is a threshold energy required
for the electron to be emitted from the surface. This energy is called the work function, f, and is a property of
the surface material. The photon energy hu must be greater than f, and this determines the longest wavelength
sensitivity of the photocathode.
