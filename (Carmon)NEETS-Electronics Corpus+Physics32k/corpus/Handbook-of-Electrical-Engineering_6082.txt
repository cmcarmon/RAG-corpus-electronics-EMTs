In parallel with the development of electromagnetic transient programs, several state variable programs were
produced to examine the fast transient behavior of parts of the electrical system, such as ac transmission lines
and  HVdc  transmission  systems.  As  these  programs  were  speciÔ¨Åcally  designed  for  the  purpose  they  were
intended, it gave them certain advantages over the general purpose electromagnetic transient program.
