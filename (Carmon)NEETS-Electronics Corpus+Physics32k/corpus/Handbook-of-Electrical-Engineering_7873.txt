Section 81.2 deals with two-state (high or low, 1 or 0, or true or false) logic circuits. Two-state logic circuits
can be broken down into two major types of circuits: combinational logic circuits and sequential logic circuits.
By deﬁnition, the external output signals of combinational logic circuits are totally dependent on the external
input signals applied to the circuit. In contrast, the output signals of sequential logic circuits are dependent on
all or part of the present state output signals of the circuit that are fed back as input signals to the circuit as
well as any external input signals if they should exist. Sequential logic circuits can be subdivided into synchro-
nous  or  clock-mode  circuits  and  asynchronous  circuits.  Asynchronous  circuits  can  be  further  divided  into
fundamental-mode circuits and pulse-mode circuits. Fig. 81.15 is the graphic classiﬁcation of logic circuits.
