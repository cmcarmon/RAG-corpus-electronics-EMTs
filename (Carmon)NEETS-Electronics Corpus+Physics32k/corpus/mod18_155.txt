In coherent detection, a stable cw reference oscillator signal, which is locked in phase with the
transmitter during each transmitted pulse, is mixed with the echo signal to produce a beat or difference
signal. Since the reference oscillator and the transmitter are locked in phase, the echoes are effectively
compared with the transmitter in frequency and phase.
