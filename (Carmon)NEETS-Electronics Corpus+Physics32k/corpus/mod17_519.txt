All satellite communications earth terminals are equipped with specially designed, highly sensitive 
receivers. These receivers are designed to overcome down-link power losses and to permit extraction of 
the desired communications information from the weak received signal. The terminals currently in use 
have specially designed preamplifiers mounted directly behind the antennas.
