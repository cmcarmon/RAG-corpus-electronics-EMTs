Mexico uses four main time zones since February 2015:
Zona Sureste (Southeast Zone) covers the state of Quintana Roo (the equivalent of Canadian and U.S. Eastern Time).
Zona Centro (Central Zone) covers the eastern three-fourths of Mexico, including Mexico City, Guadalajara and Monterrey (the equivalent of Canadian and U.S. Central Time).
Zona Pac√≠fico (Pacific Zone) covers the states of Baja California Sur, Chihuahua, Nayarit, Sinaloa, and Sonora (the equivalent of Canadian and U.S. Mountain Time).
Zona Noroeste (Northwest Zone) covers the state of Baja California, including Tijuana (the equivalent of Canadian and U.S. Pacific Time).
In addition, the law dictates that all island territories should fall within the time zone corresponding to their geographic location.
