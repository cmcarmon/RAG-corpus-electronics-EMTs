In addition to optimizing sensitivity, optical receiver design goals also include optimizing the
bandwidth and the dynamic range. A receiver that has the ability to operate over a wide range of optical
power levels can operate efficiently in both short- and long-distance applications. Because conflicts arise
when attempting to meet each goal, trade-offs in receiver designs are made to optimize overall
performance.
