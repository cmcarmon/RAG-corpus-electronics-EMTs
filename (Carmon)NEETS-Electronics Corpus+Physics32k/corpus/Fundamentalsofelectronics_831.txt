You may not have seen the arg maxi notation before. maxi {·} yields the maximum value of its argument
with respect to the index i. arg maxi equals the value of the index that yields the maximum. Note that the
precise numerical value of the integrator’s output does not matter; what does matter is its value relative to
the other integrator’s output.
