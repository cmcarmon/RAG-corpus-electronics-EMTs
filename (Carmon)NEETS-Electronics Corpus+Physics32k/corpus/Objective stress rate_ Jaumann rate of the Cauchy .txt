The Jaumann rate of the Cauchy stress is a further specialization of the Lie derivative (Truesdell rate). This rate has the form
The Jaumann rate is used widely in computations primarily for two reasons
it is relatively easy to implement.
it leads to symmetric tangent moduli.
Recall that the spin tensor

{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {w}}}
(the skew part of the velocity gradient) can be expressed as

Thus for pure rigid body motion

Alternatively, we can consider the case of proportional loading when the principal directions of strain remain constant. An example of this situation is the axial loading of a cylindrical bar. In that situation, since

{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {U}}=\left[{\begin{array}{ccc}\lambda _{X}\\&\lambda _{Y}\\&&\lambda _{Z}\end{array}}\right]}

{\displaystyle {\dot {\boldsymbol {U}}}=\left[{\begin{array}{ccc}{\dot {\lambda }}_{X}\\&{\dot {\lambda }}_{Y}\\&&{\dot {\lambda }}_{Z}\end{array}}\right]}

Also,

Therefore,
