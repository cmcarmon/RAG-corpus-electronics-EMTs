Most of the instruments commercially available are not designed speciﬁcally for power system application,
i.e.,  they  are  not  multi-phase  and  cannot  process  continuous  information.  At  the  time  of  writing,  the  only
system capable of multi-channel three-phase real time continuous monitoring is CHART [Miller and Dewe,
1992] which, although originally designed for harmonic monitoring, is capable of deriving continuous infor-
mation of other power quality indexes such as ﬂicker. It is based on the Intel Multi-bus II architecture and the
RMX 386 operating system. An illustration of the system, shown in Fig. 62.14, includes remote data conversion
  synchronization,  central  parallel  processing,  and  ethernet-
modules,  digital  ﬁber  optic  transmission, 
connected PCs for distant control and display.
