FIGURE 5.3 Logic Density and Performance Boosting. (A) The
logic density, another measurement for number of transistors per
chip, doubles every new process generation. The trend is clear for
Intel microprocessors. The horizontal axis shows the process gener-
ation, and the vertical axis shows the logic density for microprocessors
manufactured at the corresponding process. Courtesy of Intel Corpor-
ation. (B) This Ô¨Ågure shows the frequency trend for VLSI processors.
Almost same trend can be seen for each generation of processors from
companies such as Intel, IBM, and DEC. The left vertical axis shows
the frequency, the right axis shows the gate delay which decreases for
new processes. The gate delay trend is projected through the straight
line curve. Courtesy of Intel Corporation.
