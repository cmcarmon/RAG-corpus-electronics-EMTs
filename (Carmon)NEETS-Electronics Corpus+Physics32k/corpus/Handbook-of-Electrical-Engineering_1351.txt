Much recent research in speech coding below 8 kbits/s has focused on multi-mode CELP architectures and
efﬁcient approaches to source-controlled mode selection [Das et al., 1995]. Multimode coders are able to quickly
invoke a coding scheme and bit allocation speciﬁcally tailored to the local characteristics of the speech signal.
This capability has proven useful in optimizing perceptual quality at low coding rates. In fact, the majority of
algorithms currently proposed for half-rate European and U.S. digital cellular standards, as well as many algo-
rithms considered for rates below 2.4 kbits/s are multimode coders. The direct coupling between variable-rate
(multimode) speech coding and the CDMA transmission architecture is an obvious beneﬁt to both technologies.
