In derived signature methods, run-time signatures can only be
computed if the sequence of instructions executed by the
checked processor can be monitored by the WD. In the case
of traditional processor architectures, signatures can be easily
computed by monitoring the memory data bus of the checked
processor. The sequence of instructions fetched by the proces-
sor is exactly the sequence executed by it. However, modern
processor architectures include on-chip instruction caches and
prefetch queues (pipelines). The sequence of
instructions
fetched by the processor can still be monitored by the WD,
but it is not exactly the sequence of instructions executed by
the processor. Some instructions are executed in a different
order or are not executed at all.
