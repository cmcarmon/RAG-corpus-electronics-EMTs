In this approach, the signatures labeling the nodes are derived
from the opcode sequence of the node by information com-
paction (mod-2 addition, a checksum, or a linear feedback
shift register [LSFR]). The run-time signatures are also com-
puted concurrently by the WD by reading instructions from
the memory data bus when they are fetched by the main
processor. The WD computed signatures are compared to
WD reference information to perform the checking.
