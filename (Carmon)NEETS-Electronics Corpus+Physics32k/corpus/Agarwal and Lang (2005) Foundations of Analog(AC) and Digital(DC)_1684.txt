To complete the node analysis, we complete Steps 4 and 5 by solving
Equation 12.4 for v, and using it to determine iL and vC, for example. Equa-
tion 12.4 is an ordinary second-order linear differential equation with constant
coefficients. As we did with first-order systems in Section 10.11, we can obtain
a general solution to our second-order differential equation using the following
steps:
