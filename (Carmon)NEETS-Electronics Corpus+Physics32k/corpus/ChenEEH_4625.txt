The xx is the n  1 state vector, w is the nw  1 vector of
exogenous disturbances, u is the nu  1 control input vector,
z is the nz  1 error vector, and y is the ny  1 measurement
vector. Time dependency has been suppressed for notational
convenience. For Ô¨Åxed u, the nonlinear plant can be linearized

in the usual fashion to yield:
