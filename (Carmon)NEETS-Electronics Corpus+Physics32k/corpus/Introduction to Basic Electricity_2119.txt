The calculation of R3 is only slightly more difficult. 
From the previous calculations, the total current flow-
ing through the resistor was determined to be 160 mA. 
Remember that voltage dividers are ratios, or the rela-
tion of one potential point to another. The desired volt-
age junction B is 6 volts. However, this voltage is not 
used in the calculation. Junction B is above junction A,
