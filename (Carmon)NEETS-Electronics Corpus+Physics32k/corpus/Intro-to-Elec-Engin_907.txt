It is generally more convenient to have the equivalent circuit entirely referred to either
primary or secondary by using the ideal-transformer relationships [Equations (11.3.2), (11.3.3),
and (11.3.7)], thereby eliminating the need for the ideal transformer to appear in the equivalent
circuit. Figure 11.3.4 shows such circuits, which are very useful for determining the transformer
characteristics.
