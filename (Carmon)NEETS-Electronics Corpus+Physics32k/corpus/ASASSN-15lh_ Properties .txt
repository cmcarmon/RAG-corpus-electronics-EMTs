Based on its redshift and location projected on the nucleus of a large galaxy, the distance of ASASSN-15lh is calculated at 1,171 Mpc, in a large luminous galaxy.
At its peak, the absolute magnitude of ASASSN-15lh in the AB magnitude system u band was −23.5. Its bolometric luminosity is twice that of the previous brightest type-I superluminous supernova, iPTF13ajg. At its brightest, it was approximately 50 times more luminous than the whole Milky Way galaxy, with an energy flux 570 billion times greater than the Sun. The total energy radiated in the first 50 days exceeded 1.1×1045 joules. According to Krzysztof Stanek of Ohio State University, one of the principal investigators at ASAS-SN, "If it was in our own galaxy, it would shine brighter than the full moon; there would be no night, and it would be easily seen during the day."
The spectrum of ASASSN-15lh was relatively featureless, with no hydrogen or helium lines, but two very broad absorption bands. Ionised magnesium absorption doublets were detected and used to confirm the redshift at 0.2326.
The temperature of ASASSN-15lh at the time of maximum luminosity was 20,000 K, although it was hotter earlier in the outburst. By 50 days after the peak, the temperature had declined to 11,000 K and then remained relatively constant. The radius of ASASSN-15lh at peak brightness was over 70,000 R☉.
