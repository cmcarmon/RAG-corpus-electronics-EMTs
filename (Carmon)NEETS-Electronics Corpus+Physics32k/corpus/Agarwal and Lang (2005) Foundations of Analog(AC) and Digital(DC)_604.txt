The circuit now looks like Figure 4.21a. The diode characteristic with a number of
different plots of Equation 4.31 (or load lines), corresponding to a representative set of
values of vI, is shown in Figure 4.21b. In Figures 4.21c and 4.21d we show the input
sinusoid vI(t), and the corresponding succession of values of vO(t) derived from the
graphical analysis in Figure 4.21b. Note from Figure 4.21a (or Equation 4.31) that
