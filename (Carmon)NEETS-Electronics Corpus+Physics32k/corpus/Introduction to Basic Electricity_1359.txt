insulators, the opposite of conductors, prevent the 
flow of electricity. Insulators are stabilized by absorbing 
valence electrons from other atoms to fill their valence 
shells, thus eliminating free electrons. Materials classi-
fied as insulators are compared in Figure 10-7. Mica is 
the best insulator because it has the fewest free electrons 
in its valence shell. A perfect insulator has atoms with 
full valence shells. This means it cannot gain electrons.
