The pacemaker circuitry along with a lithium battery are enclosed in a metal case, which is
implanted under the skin on the patient’s chest. The mental case and the tip of the catheter (a wire
enclosed in an insulating tube) form the electrical terminals of the pacemaker. A simpliﬁed block
diagram of a typical demand pacemaker is shown in Figure 9.5.1.
