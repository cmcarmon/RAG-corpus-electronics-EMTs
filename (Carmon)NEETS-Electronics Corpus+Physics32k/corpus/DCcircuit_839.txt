An analog signal is a kind of signal that is continuously variable, as opposed to having
a limited number of steps along its range (called digital). A well-known example of analog
vs. digital is that of clocks: analog being the type with pointers that slowly rotate around a
circular scale, and digital being the type with decimal number displays or a ”second-hand” that
jerks rather than smoothly rotates. The analog clock has no physical limit to how ﬁnely it can
display the time, as its ”hands” move in a smooth, pauseless fashion. The digital clock, on the
other hand, cannot convey any unit of time smaller than what its display will allow for. The
type of clock with a ”second-hand” that jerks in 1-second intervals is a digital device with a
minimum resolution of one second.
