The  ﬁrst  condition  is  called  the  bifurcation  subsystem  condition  and  the  second  is  called  the  geometric
decoupling condition. Finding a bifurcation subsystem for any bifurcation of the full system model requires
ﬁnding the combination of correct dimension, correct subset of equations, and correct subset of variables such
that  the  subsystem  experiences  the  bifurcation  (Eq. (63.49))  of  the  full  system  model  (Eq. (63.48))  but  also
produces that bifurcation since the external model is completely uncoupled from the bifurcation subsystem in
the  direction  of  the  right  eigenvector  (Eq. (63.50)).  The  right  eigenvector  is  an  approximation  of  the  center
manifold at bifurcation, and the center manifold is the subsystem that actually experiences the bifurcation and
is obtained via a nonlinear transformation of the model. The expectation of ﬁnding a bifurcation subsystem
for  any  loadﬂow  bifurcation,  noting  the  above  requirements  for  identifying  such  a  bifurcation  subsystem,  is
that  the  difﬁculty  in  ﬁnding  a  bifurcation  subsystem  would  be  great  even  though  one  may  exist  for  some
bifurcations. The results in [Schlueter, 1998b; f] prove that one cannot only describe the bifurcation subsystem
(where)  for  every  clogging  voltage  instability  and  for  every  loss  of  control  voltage  instability,  but  also  can
theoretically establish diagnostic information on when, proximity, and cure for a speciﬁc bifurcation in a speciﬁc
bifurcation subsystem for clogging or for loss of control voltage instability [Schlueter, 1998b; f].
