Example 1.3 
 
Express a quarter of a cycle revolution in terms of: 
 
(a) degrees; 
(b) radians. 
 
Solution 
 
(a) There are 360° in one complete cycle (i.e. one 
full revolution. Hence there are (360/4)° or 90° in 
one quarter of a cycle. 
(b)  There  are  2A radians  in  one  complete  cycle. 
Thus there are 2A/4 or A/2 radians in one quarter of 
a cycle. 
 
Example 1.4 
 
Express an angle of 215° in radians. 
 
Solution 
 
To convert from degrees to radians, divide by 57.3. 
So 215° is equivalent to 215/57.3 = 3.75 radians. 
 
Example 1.5 
 
Express an angle of 2.5 radians in degrees. 
 
Solution 
 
To  convert  from  radians  to  degrees,  multiply  by 
57.3. Hence 2.5 radians is equivalent to 2.5 × 57.3 
= 143.25°.
