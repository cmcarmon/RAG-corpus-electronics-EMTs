C4 Flip-Chip
The C4 ﬂip-chip is used to manage the IR drop. IBM research-
ers developed C4 technology in the 1960s (see Figure 7.12).
The bonding process is characterized by the soldering of
silicon devices directly to a substrate (e.g., organic). The chip
faces the substrate as opposed to wire bonding, hence the
name ﬂip-chip bonding. There are two main salient features
of this packaging methodology. One involves solder bumps
that are distributed on metal terminals of the chip itself.
These solder bumps are typically composed of 97% lead and
3% tin. The substrate has identically placed metal pads on
its surface. The second feature is that the chip is turned
over and the metal pads are aligned to solder bumps; metal
reﬂow is used to form connectivity between the substrate and
chip.
