Solution to Exercise 4.13 (p. 116)
−∞ S (f ) e+j2πf (−t)df =
s (−t). Therefore, two Fourier transforms applied to s (t) yields s (−t). We need two more to get us back
where we started.
Solution to Exercise 4.14 (p. 118)
The signal is the inverse Fourier transform of the triangularly shaped spectrum, and equals s (t) =
