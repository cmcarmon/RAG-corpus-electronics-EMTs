A  good  choice  of  the  dc  operating  point  or  quiescent  point  (Q  point)
for an ampliÔ¨Åer is in the middle of the active region at IDS = IDSS /2. This
allows for the maximum symmetrical drain current swing, from the qui-
escent level of IDSQ = IDSS /2, down to a minimum of IDS @  0, and up to a
maximum of IDS = IDSS. This choice for the Q point is also a good one from
the standpoint of allowing for an adequate safety margin for the location
