Since tropospheric scatter depends on turbulence in the atmosphere, changes in atmospheric 
conditions have an effect on the strength of the received signal. Both daily and seasonal variations in 
signal strength occur as a result of changes in the atmosphere. These variations are called long-term 
fading.
