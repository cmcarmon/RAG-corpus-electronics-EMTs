The nonlinear graviton construction encodes only anti-self-dual, i.e., left-handed fields. A first step towards the problem of modifying twistor space so as to encode a general gravitational field is to ask to encode right handed fields. Infinitesimally, these are encoded in twistor functions or cohomology classes of homogeneity â€“6. The task of using such twistor functions in a fully nonlinear way so as to obtain a right-handed non-linear graviton has been referred to as the (gravitational) googly problem (the word "googly" is a term used in the game of cricket for a ball bowled with right-handed helicity using the apparent action that would normally give rise to left-handed helicity). The most recent proposal in this direction by Penrose in 2015 was based on noncommutative geometry on twistor space and referred to as palatial twistor theory (named after Buckingham Palace, the place in which Michael Atiyah suggested to Penrose the use of a type of "noncommutative algebra", an important component of the theory).
