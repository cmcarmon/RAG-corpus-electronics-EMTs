The advantages of using a differential voltmeter for measuring dc voltages are the extreme accuracy
and minimal circuit loading made possible by the high input impedance of the meter. However,
differential voltmeters are less portable, heavier, and require greater skill and time when performing
measurements than other types of voltmeters. Additionally, they require long warm-up periods and are
susceptible to variations in temperature and humidity.
