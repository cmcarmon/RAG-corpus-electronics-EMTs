Navigation
 is the determination of the position and velocity of a moving vehicle on land, at sea, in the air, or
in space. The three components of position and the three components of velocity make up a six-component
state vector
  that  fully  describes  the  translational  motion  of  the  vehicle  because  the  differential  equations  of
motion are of second order. Surveyors are beginning to use the same sensors as navigators but are achieving
higher accuracy as a result of longer periods of observation, a Ô¨Åxed location, and more complex, non-real-time
data reduction.
