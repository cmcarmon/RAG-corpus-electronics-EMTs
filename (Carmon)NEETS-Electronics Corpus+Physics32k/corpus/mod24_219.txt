EXTRINSIC ABSORPTION occurs when impurities, such as hydroxyl ions (OH-), are introduced
into the fiber. OH- absorption peaks define three regions or windows of preferred operation. The first
window is centered at 850 nm. The second window is centered at 1300 nm. The third window is centered
at 1550 nm.
