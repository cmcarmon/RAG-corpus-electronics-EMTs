is the shape most commonly used. The radius of the loop,
R, could be electrically small or large. If the current distribu-
tion along the wire loop is known, or can at least be closely
approximated based on some physical insight, then the radi-
ated ﬁelds of the loop antenna can be derived analytically or
computed numerically. This is possible by treating the loop as
a superposition of small current elements with known ampli-
tudes, physical location, and orientation. The far-ﬁeld quan-
tities for a small dipole antenna, as presented in Section 6.7.1,
with suitable transformation of its coordinates to account for
different physical location and orientation, can be used here to
model the elemental radiation.
If the current loop is small (R  l0), the far-ﬁeld quantities
can be derived into a simple ﬁnal form. In this case, the current
along the loop I(f0
can be assumed to be independent of
^ff0
, with a magnitude equal to the input current Iin. With
reference to Figure 6.15, consider the small current element
of length RDf0
. The
radiation ﬁelds due to this current element can be expressed
using results from Section 6.7.1, equations 6.134 and 6.135.
One must properly adjust these equations, however, to account
for the orientation of the current element along ^ff0
and its
location at (R, f0
