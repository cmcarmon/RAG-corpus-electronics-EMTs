The piecewise linear analysis technique proceeds by focusing on one
straight-line segment at a time, and using our previously developed linear anal-
ysis tools to make calculations within each segment. Notice that we are able
to apply our linear analysis tools because the nonlinear device characteristics
are approximated as linear within each segment. To facilitate our calculations,
let us first draw the circuit that results for each of the straight-line segments
comprising the ideal diode model.
