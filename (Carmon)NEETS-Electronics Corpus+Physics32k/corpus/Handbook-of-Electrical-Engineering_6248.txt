The existing 525-line monochrome standards were retained for color in the recommendations of the National
Television  System  Committee  (NTSC)  for  compatible  color  television  in  the  early  1950s.  The  NTSC  system,
adopted in 1953 by the FCC, speciﬁes a scanning system of 525 horizontal lines per frame, with each frame
consisting of two interlaced ﬁelds of 262.5 lines at a ﬁeld rate of 59.94 Hz. Forty-two of the 525 lines in each
frame are blanked as black picture signals and reserved for transmission of the vertical scanning synchronizing
signal. This results in 483 visible lines of picture information. Because the vertical blanking interval represents
a  signiﬁcant  amount  of  the  total  transmitted  waveform,  the  television  industry  has  sought  ways  to  carry
additional data during the blanking interval. Such applications include closed captioning and system test signals.
