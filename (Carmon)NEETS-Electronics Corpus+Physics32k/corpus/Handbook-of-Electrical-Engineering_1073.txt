Note that the time-differentiation and time-integration properties of the CT Fourier transform do not have
analogous counterparts in the DTFT because time-domain differentiation and integration are not deﬁned for
DT signals. When working with DT systems practitioners must often manipulate difference equations in the
frequency domain. For this purpose Property 1 (linearity) and Property 2 (index shifting) are important. As
with the CT Fourier transform, Property 4 (time-domain convolution) is very important for DT systems because
it allows engineers to work with the frequency response of the system in order to achieve proper shaping of
the  input  spectrum,  or  to  achieve  frequency  selective  ﬁltering  for  noise  reduction  or  signal  detection.  Also,
Property 3 (frequency shifting) is useful for the analysis of modulation and ﬁltering common in both analog
and digital communication systems.
