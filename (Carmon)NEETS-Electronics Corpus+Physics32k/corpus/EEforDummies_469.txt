Magnetic flux is just a way to represent the strength and direction of a mag-
netic field. To understand magnetic lines of flux, think about the effects of air 
on a sailboat’s sail. The stronger the wind and the larger the sail, the greater 
the force of air on the sail. But if the sail is oriented parallel to the direction 
of wind flow, air slips by the sail and even a strong wind will not move the 
sail. The effect of the wind is greatest when it hits the sail head‐on — that is, 
when the surface of the sail is perpendicular to the direction of wind flow. If 
you try to represent the strength and direction of the wind and the orienta-
tion of the sail in a diagram, you might draw arrows showing the force of the 
wind extending through the surface of the sail. Likewise, lines of magnetic 
flux illustrate the strength and orientation of a magnetic field, showing you 
how the force of the magnetic field will act on an object placed within the 
field. Objects placed in the magnetic field will be maximally affected by the 
force of the magnetic field if they are oriented perpendicular to the flux lines.
