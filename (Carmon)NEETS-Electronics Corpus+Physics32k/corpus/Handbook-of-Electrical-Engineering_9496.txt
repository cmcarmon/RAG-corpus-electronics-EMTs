The  CREATE  TABLE  command  speciﬁes  all  the  attribute  names  of  a  relation  and  their  data  types  (e.g.,
INTEGER,  DECIMAL,  ﬁxed  length  character  “CHAR”,  variable  length  character  “VARCHAR”,  DATE).  The
constraint NOT NULL is usually speciﬁed for those attributes that cannot have null values. The primary key
of each relation in the database is usually required to have a nonnull value.
