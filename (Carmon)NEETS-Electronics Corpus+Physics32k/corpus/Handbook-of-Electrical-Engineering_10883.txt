macros and functions. MATLAB has these, and their provision is clearly important to the users of the package
and developers of toolbox extensions. However, there is a limit to the software robustness of the mechanisms
that MATLAB provides. MATLAB is an un-typed language, all data structures used in extensions to MATLAB
are implemented in terms of collections of matrices and vectors. It is therefore up to the programmer to develop
conventions for using these data items such that the algorithms work properly. A strongly typed language, in
which the user must specify the nature of each data object before it is used, is a much safer basis on which to
provide extensions that are to be used by many other people.
