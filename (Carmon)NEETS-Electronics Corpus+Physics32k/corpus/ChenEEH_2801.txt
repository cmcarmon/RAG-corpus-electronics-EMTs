Indeed, a physical model based on an anisotropic, perfectly
matched medium can be formulated. This was ﬁrst discussed by
Sacks et al. (1995). For a single interface, the anisotropic
medium is uniaxial and is composed of both electric and mag-
netic constitutive tensors. This uniaxial PML, or UPML, per-
forms as well as Berenger’s PML while avoiding its nonphysical
ﬁeld splitting. Further, as summarized in Gedney and Taﬂove
(2000), UPML has capabilities exceeding Berenger’s PML by
providing additional degrees of freedom which permit it to
attenuate evanescent waves and terminate conductive and dis-
persive materials. The next subsection summarizes the fre-
quency- and time-domain realizations of the UPML ABC.
