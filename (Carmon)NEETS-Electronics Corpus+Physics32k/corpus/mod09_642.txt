If the time constant for the circuit in figure 4-39 is increased to make it a long time-constant circuit, 
the differentiator output will appear more like the input. The time constant for the circuit can be changed 
by either increasing the value of capacitance or resistance. In this circuit, the time constant will be 
increased by increasing the value of resistance from 10,000 ohms to 100,000 ohms. Increasing the value 
of resistance will result in a time constant of 1,000 microseconds. The time constant is 10 times the 
duration of the input pulse. The output of this long time-constant circuit is shown in figure 4-42.
