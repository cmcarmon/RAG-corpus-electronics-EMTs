The assumption is made that all the spins rotate so that they remain parallel at all times. This is known as
coherent rotation. In the case of g-Fe2O3, an incoherent mode of reversal probably occurs since the maximum
observed coercivity is only 350 Oe. Several incoherent modes have been proposed, e.g., chain-of-spheres fanning
[Jacobs  and  Bean,  1955],  curling  [Shtrikman  and  Treves,  1959].  Their  characteristics  and  differences  are
discussed by Bate [1980]. The coercivity of particles of g-Fe2O3 is increased (in order to make recording tapes
of extended frequency response) by precipitating cobalt hydroxide on the surface of the particles. After gentle
warming, the cobalt is incorporated on the surface of the particles and increases the coercivity to 650 Oe (51
Â· 73 kA/m).
