To build a knowledge base, the knowledge can be either
captured through knowledge engineers or be generated auto-
matically by machine learning techniques. For example, rules
in rule-based expert systems may be obtained through a
knowledge acquisition process
involving domain experts
and knowledge engineers or may be generated automatically
from examples using decision-tree learning algorithms. Case-
based reasoning is another example of automated knowledge
extraction in which the expert system searches its collection of
past cases, Ô¨Ånds the ones that are similar to the new problem,
and applies the corresponding solutions to the new one. The
whole process is fully automatic. An expert system of this type
can be built quickly and maintained easily by adding and
deleting cases. Automatic knowledge generation is especially
good when a large set of examples exist or when no domain
expert exists.
