To use Eq. (24.32) to Ô¨Ånd a formula for threshold voltage, we need expressions for Ninv and QD. Assuming
the interface is held at a lower energy than the bulk due to the charge on the gate, the minority-carrier density
at the interface is larger than in the bulk semiconductor, even below threshold. Below threshold and even up
to  the  threshold  of  Eq. (24.32),  the  number  of  charges  in  the  channel/unit  area  Ninv  is  given  for  n-channel
devices approximately by [Brews, 1981]:
