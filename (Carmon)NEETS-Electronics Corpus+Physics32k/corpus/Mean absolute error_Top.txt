In statistics, mean absolute error (MAE) is a measure of difference between two continuous variables. Assume X and Y are variables of paired observations that express the same phenomenon. Examples of Y versus X include comparisons of predicted versus observed, subsequent time versus initial time, and one technique of measurement versus an alternative technique of measurement. Consider a scatter plot of n points, where point i has coordinates (xi, yi)... Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is the average vertical distance between each point and the Y=X line, which is also known as the One-to-One line. MAE is also the average horizontal distance between each point and the Y=X line.
The Mean Absolute Error is given by:

{\displaystyle \mathrm {MAE} ={\frac {\sum _{i=1}^{n}\left|y_{i}-x_{i}\right|}{n}}={\frac {\sum _{i=1}^{n}\left|e_{i}\right|}{n}}.}

It is possible to express MAE as the sum of two components: Quantity Disagreement and Allocation Disagreement. Quantity Disagreement is the absolute value of the Mean Error. Allocation Disagreement is MAE minus Quantity Disagreement. The Mean Error is given by:

It is also possible to identify the types of difference by looking at an

plot. Allocation difference exists if and only if points reside on both sides of the Y=X line. Quantity difference exists when the average of the X values does not equal the average of the Y values.
MAE has a clear interpretation as the average absolute difference between yi and xi. Many researchers want to know this average difference because its interpretation is clear, but researchers frequently compute and misinterpret the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which is not the average absolute error.

As the name suggests, the mean absolute error is an average of the absolute errors

This is known as a scale-dependent accuracy measure and therefore cannot be used to make comparisons between series using different scales. The mean absolute error is a common measure of forecast error in time series analysis, where the terms "mean absolute deviation" is sometimes used in confusion with the more standard definition of mean absolute deviation. The same confusion exists more generally.
