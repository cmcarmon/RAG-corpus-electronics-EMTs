This potential energy, stored in the form of an electric charge imbalance and capable of
provoking electrons to ﬂow through a conductor, can be expressed as a term called voltage,
which technically is a measure of potential energy per unit charge of electrons, or something a
physicist would call speciﬁc potential energy. Deﬁned in the context of static electricity, voltage
is the measure of work required to move a unit charge from one location to another, against the
force which tries to keep electric charges balanced. In the context of electrical power sources,
voltage is the amount of potential energy available (work to be done) per unit charge, to move
electrons through a conductor.
