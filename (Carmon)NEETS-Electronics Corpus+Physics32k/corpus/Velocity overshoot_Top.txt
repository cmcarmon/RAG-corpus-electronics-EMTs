Velocity overshoot is a physical effect discovered in 1969, resulting in transit times of a charge carrier going between terminals being smaller than the time required to emit an optical phonon. The velocity therefore exceeds the saturation velocity up to three times, which leads to faster field-effect transistor or bipolar transistor switching. The effect is noticeable in the ordinary field-effect transistor for the gates shorter than 0.1 um.
The device intentionally designed to benefit from the velocity overshoot is called Ballistic collection transistor (not to be mistaken with the Ballistic Deflection Transistor).
