speeds are possible. The articulated arm is good for tasks involving multiple insertions, complex motions, and
varied tool orientations. The versatility of this conﬁguration makes it applicable to a variety of tasks, so the
user has fewer limitations on the use of the robot. However, the same features that give this robot its advantages
lead to certain disadvantages. The geometry is complex, and the resulting kinematic equations are quite intricate.
Straight-line  motion  is  difﬁcult  to  coordinate.  Control  is  generally  more  difﬁcult  than  for  other  geometries,
with associated increase in cost. Here again, arm resolution is not ﬁxed throughout the workspace. Additionally,
the dynamics of an articulated arm vary widely throughout the workspace, so that performance will vary over
the workspace for a ﬁxed controller. In spite of these disadvantages, the articulated arm has been applied to a
wide variety of research and industrial tasks, including spray painting, clean room tasks, machine loading, and
parts-ﬁnishing tasks.
