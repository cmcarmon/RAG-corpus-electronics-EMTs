Let us now consider a model of an ideal (lossless) electromechanical energy converter that
is doubly excited, as shown in Figure 12.4.2, with two sets of electrical terminal pairs and one
mechanical terminal, schematically representing a motor. Note that all types of losses have been
excluded to form a conservative energy-conversion device that can be described by state functions
to yield the electromechanical coupling terms in electromechanics. A property of a conservative
system is that its energy is a function of its state only, and is described by the same independent
variables that describe the state. State functions at a given instant of time depend solely on the
state of the system at that instant and not on past history; they are independent of how the system
is brought to that particular state.
