The gravitational field g (also called gravitational acceleration) is a vector field â€“ a vector at each point of space (and time). It is defined so that the gravitational force experienced by a particle is equal to the mass of the particle multiplied by the gravitational field at that point.
Gravitational flux is a surface integral of the gravitational field over a closed surface, analogous to how magnetic flux is a surface integral of the magnetic field.
Gauss's law for gravity states:
The gravitational flux through any closed surface is proportional to the enclosed mass.
