Armoring stone, which is any stone that is used to "shield" the rest of the in-situ cap, can be used for resistance to erosion and should be considered in cap design. The long-term ability of the cap to perform depends primarily on its ability to withstand external forces, mostly hydraulic forces. There are three basic approaches that may be used to have long-term cap stability:
The cap layer needs to be armored sufficiently to hold up under the various hydraulic forces.
Cap at a deeper layer since hydraulic forces typically decrease with decreasing depth.
Try to control the hydraulic forces to limit their effect on the cap layer with breakwaters, dams, navigational controls, etc.
