11.4.9 A 25-kVA, 2400/240-V, 60-Hz, single-phase
transformer has an equivalent series impedance
of 3.45 + j5.75  referred to the primary high-
voltage side. The core loss is 120 W. When the
transformer is delivering rated kVA to a load at
rated secondary voltage and a 0.85 lagging power
factor, ﬁnd the percent voltage regulation and the
efﬁciency of the transformer.
