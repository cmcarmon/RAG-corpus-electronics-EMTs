Now let's look at inductors and their application in filter circuits. Remember, AN INDUCTOR 
OPPOSES ANY CHANGE IN CURRENT. In case you have forgotten, a change in current through an 
inductor produces a changing electromagnetic field. The changing field, in turn, cuts the windings of the 
wire in the inductor and thereby produces a counter electromotive force (CEMF). It is the CEMF that 
opposes the change in circuit current. Opposition to a change in current at a given frequency is called 
inductive reactance (XL) and is measured in ohms. The inductive reactance (XL) of an inductor is 
determined by the applied frequency and the inductance of the inductor.
