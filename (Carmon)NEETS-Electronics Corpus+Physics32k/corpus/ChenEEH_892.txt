One way to achieve the speciﬁed goal of higher circuit
reliability is to artiﬁcially shrink the permissible range of
each local data path by an equal amount from either side of
the interval and determine a feasible clock skew schedule based
on these new timing constraints. This idea has been addressed
by Fishburn (1990) as the problem of maximizing the min-
imum slack (over all inequalities of equations 4.5 and 4.6) or
the amount by which an inequality exceeds the limit. Formally,
the problem can be expressed as the linear programming
problem LCSS–SAFE:
