The desired output of an oscillator is a stable, single frequency
tone. Microwave frequency oscillators typically use loop-feed-
back or reﬂection-type feedback for stabilization. Microwave
frequency oscillators may use any device that exhibits negative
resistance when conﬁgured properly. Within their operating
frequency range, bipolar junction transistor (BJT) devices as
well as FET and HEMT devices are often used. At millimeter-
wave frequencies, Gunn diodes or IMPATT diodes are often
used. Accurate prediction of the output power and precise
frequency of oscillation requires a nonlinear model of the
device used in the oscillator. Use of high-Q resonators, how-
ever, allows reliable prediction of oscillation frequency even
