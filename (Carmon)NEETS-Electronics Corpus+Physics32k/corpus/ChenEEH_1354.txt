Maintaining a centralized directory has the least overhead in
terms of storage (Stenstrom, 1990), but it suffers from several
disadvantages. Every local action that could possibly cause a
change in global state must be reported to the controller,
causing a bottleneck due to its centralized nature. In addition,
a hardware search mechanism must be implemented that
allows the controller to search through all duplicates to Ô¨Ånd
which caches have copies of a particular block.
