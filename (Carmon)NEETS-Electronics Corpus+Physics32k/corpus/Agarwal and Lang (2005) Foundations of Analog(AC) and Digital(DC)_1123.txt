The circuit that is generated by this procedure is the desired small-signal
circuit model, and is analogous to equating the small signal terms on both
sides of Equation 8.8 yielding the equalities in Equation 8.10. Further, it is a
linear circuit, and hence the analysis tools developed for linear circuits, such as
superposition and the Th√©venin equivalent model, may be applied to its analysis.
At this point, it is worth discussing why the procedure works. To begin,
recognize that the operation of a circuit is described in total by two sets of
equations: the circuit connection laws of KVL and KCL, and the constitutive
laws that describe the behavior of the individual circuit components. With this
recognition, the small-signal analysis of a circuit may also be described by the
following more direct mathematical procedure:
