A more efÔ¨Åcient way (in terms of package count) to implement the same combinational logic function would
be to use a medium-scale integration (MSI) 4- to 16-1ine decoder with gates as illustrated in Fig. 81.19. The
tildes are used as in-line symbols for the logical complements of D0 through D15 as recommended by IEEE.
