15.2.14 One of the many types of product device to pro-
duce suppressed-carrier AM is shown in Figure
P15.2.14. Explain brieﬂy how the device operates.
15.2.15 If the output signal from an AM modulator is given
by u(t ) = 5 cos 1800 π t + 20 cos 2000 π t +
5 cos 2200 π t, determine:
(a) The modulating signal m(t) and carrier c(t).
(b) The modulation index.
(c) The ratio of the power in sidebands to the
