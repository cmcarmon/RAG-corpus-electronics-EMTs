End users use optical time-domain reflectometry to characterize optical fiber and optical connection
properties in the field. In optical time-domain reflectometry, an OTDR transmits an optical pulse through
an installed optical fiber. The OTDR measures the fraction of light that is reflected back due to Rayleigh
scattering and Fresnel reflection. By comparing the amount of light scattered back at different times, the
OTDR can determine fiber and connection losses. When several fibers are connected to form an installed
cable plant, the OTDR can characterize optical fiber and optical connection properties along the entire
length of the cable plant. A fiber optic cable plant consists of optical fiber cables, connectors, splices,
mounting panels, jumper cables, and other passive components. A cable plant does not include active
components such as optical transmitters or receivers.
