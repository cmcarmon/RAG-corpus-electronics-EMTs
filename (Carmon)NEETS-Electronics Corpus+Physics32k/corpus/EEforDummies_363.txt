Lamps, diodes (discussed in Chapter 9), and other components also come 
with maximum power ratings. If you expect them to perform at power levels 
higher than their ratings, you’re going to be disappointed when too much 
power makes them pop and fizzle. When you select the part, you should con-
sider the maximum possible power the part will need to handle in the circuit. 
You do this by determining the maximum current you’ll be passing through 
the part and the voltage across the part, and then multiplying those quanti-
ties together. Then you choose a part with a power rating that exceeds that 
estimated maximum power.
