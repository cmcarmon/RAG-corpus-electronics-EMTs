The very qualities which cause CO2 to be a valuable extinguishing agent also make it dangerous to
life. When it replaces oxygen in the air to the extent that combustion cannot be sustained, respiration also
cannot be sustained. Exposure of a person to an atmosphere of high concentration of CO2 will cause
suffocation.
