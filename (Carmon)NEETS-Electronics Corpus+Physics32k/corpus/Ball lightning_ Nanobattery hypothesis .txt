Oleg Meshcheryakov suggests that ball lightning is made of composite nano or submicrometre particlesâ€”each particle constituting a battery. A surface discharge shorts these batteries, causing a current that forms the ball. His model is described as an aerosol model that explains all the observable properties and processes of ball lightning.
