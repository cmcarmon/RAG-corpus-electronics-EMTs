There are Ô¨Åve imaging modalities: x-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computer tomography (CT),
nuclear medicine (NM), and ultrasound (US). These modalities create images which are very different not only
in medical terms but in their size and content. As a result, there are three main areas under PACS which are
critical  in  succeeding  with  such  systems:  communications  (i.e.,  network,  transmission  protocol,  and  image
format), archiving (i.e., database and storage media), and image processing (i.e., display, user interface, and IP
algorithms).
