In IVF or its derivatives, fertilization rate may be used to measure how many oocytes become fertilized by sperm cells. A fertilization rate of zero in one cycle, where no oocytes become fertilized, is termed a total fertilization failure. Repeated ICSI treatment may be useful or necessary in couples with total fertilization failure.
