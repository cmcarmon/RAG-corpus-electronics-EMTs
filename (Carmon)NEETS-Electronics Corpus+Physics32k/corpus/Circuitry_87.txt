Having shown that two 100  $ resistors connected 
in parallel will provide us with a resistance of 50 $
we  now  need  to  consider  the  power  rating.  Since 
the resistors are identical, the applied power will be 
shared  equally  between  them.  Hence  each  resistor 
should have a power rating of 1W.
