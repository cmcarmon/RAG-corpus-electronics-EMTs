Aeolian sounds can be produced in the rigging of a sail-powered ship. The vortex trails produced as the wind passes over a rope produce a sound with a frequency that varies with the velocity of the wind and the thickness of the rope. Each doubling of the wind velocity results in an octave increase in the tone, allowing up to a six octave variation in a strong, gusty wind. Ships may also carry Helmholtz resonators that amplify these sounds. Aeolian sounds can also be heard among the openings in limestone cliffs.
Some songs have been written to emulate these varying wind sounds, such as "The Winter Wind" by Frédéric Chopin or "Tempest" by Ludwig van Beethoven.
