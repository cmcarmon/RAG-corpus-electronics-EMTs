So far you have been dealing with the capacitor as a device which passes ac and in which the only 
opposition to the alternating current has been the normal circuit resistance present in any conductor. 
However, capacitors themselves offer a very real opposition to current flow. This opposition arises from 
the fact that, at a given voltage and frequency, the number of electrons which go back and forth from 
plate to plate is limited by the storage ability-that is, the capacitance-of the capacitor. As the capacitance 
is increased, a greater number of electrons change plates every cycle, and (since current is a measure of 
the number of electrons passing a given point in a given time) the current is increased.
