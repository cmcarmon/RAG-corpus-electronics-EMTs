Soon researchers at private companies and institutions of higher learning were cranking out new software
protocols  to  allow  computers  access  to  this  new  highway.  In  1969,  the  ﬁrst  three ARPAnet  participants  were
linked between Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, and the University of California at Los Angeles and
the University of California at Santa Barbara. The system grew slowly for the ﬁrst decade, a bit faster over the
next 10 years, and exploded in the 1990s as protocols, access, and individual desk top computers increased.
