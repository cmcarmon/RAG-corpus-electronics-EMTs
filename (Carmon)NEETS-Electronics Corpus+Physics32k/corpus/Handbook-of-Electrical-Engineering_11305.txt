Future
There are many exciting advancements currently under development for pacemakers. Efforts are being concentrated
on making devices more sophisticated but less complicated [Jones et al., 1999]. One approach to realizing these
goals is to expand the number and ability of the automatic features, such as autosense and autocapture algorithms.
Pacemakers  are  trending  toward  automatic  self-optimization  abilities  that  are  based  on  the  individual  patient’s
needs. Improvements in rate adaptive sensors and algorithms are key to realizing this goal and represent an area of
signiﬁcant  research.  In  the  future,  integrated  circuit  technology  will  allow  for  much  smaller  and  more  efﬁcient
designs.  This,  in  addition  to  improved  battery  technology,  will  allow  for  increased  memory,  advanced  signal
processing, and faster telemetry. More memory will permit more extensive patient diagnostics. These diagnostics
will  be  displayed  on  advanced  programmer  interfaces  that  are  more  clinically  relevant.  Pacemaker  lead  research
may ultimately yield single-pass leads, capable of pacing and sensing in both the atria and the ventricles. Finally,
nontraditional pacemaker uses are currently being explored. A major area of interest is in the treatment of congestive
heart failure (CHF). CHF is a debilitating and deadly disease characterized by an enlarged heart that is incapable
of  pumping  adequate  blood  to  the  body.  It  is  possible  that  the  size  of  the  heart  facilitates  an  electromechanical
asynchrony  between  the  ventricles.  Recent  studies  have  shown  that  appropriately  positioned  and  timed  pacing
stimuli can help to improve cardiac output by synchronizing the ventricles [Foster et al., 1994; Bakker et al., 1994].
