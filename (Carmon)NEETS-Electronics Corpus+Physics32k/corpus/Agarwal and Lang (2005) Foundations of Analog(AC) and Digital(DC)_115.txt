12. In case you are wondering how the Pentium IV and similar chips get away with high clock
speeds, the key lies in designing circuits and laying them out on the chip in a way that most signals
traverse a relatively small fraction of the chip in a clock cycle. To enable succeeding generations
of the chip to be clocked faster, signals must traverse progressively shorter distances. A technique
called pipelining is the key enabling mechanism that accomplishes this. The few circuits in which
signals travel the length of the chip must be designed with extreme care using transmission line
analysis.
