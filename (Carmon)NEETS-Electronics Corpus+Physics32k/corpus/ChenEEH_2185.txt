Considering one or more loops of current in space, it can be
shown that the magnetic ﬂux through a loop is proportional to
the current that produces the magnetic ﬂux (Paul et al., 1998).
(This behavior is evident in equation 1.91 for the toroid.) The
constant of proportionality is called inductance with units of
henry (H). Speciﬁcally, inductance is deﬁned in terms of the
ﬂux linkage and current as:
