When this filter is used, the RC charge time of the filter capacitor (C1) must be short and the RC 
discharge time must be long to eliminate ripple action. In other words, the capacitor must charge up fast, 
preferably with no discharge at all. Better filtering also results when the input frequency is high; 
therefore, the full-wave rectifier output is easier to filter than that of the half-wave rectifier because of its 
higher frequency.
