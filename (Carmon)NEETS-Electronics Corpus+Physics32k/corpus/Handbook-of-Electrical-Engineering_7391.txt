The  bandwidth  of  the  measurement,  or  the  frequency  with  which  the  measured  quantity  changes,  is  also
seriously limited by the telemeter. In the FM/FM telemeter, the permissible bandwidth varies from a relatively
low value on the lower-frequency subcarriers to a reasonably high value on the high-frequency subcarriers. The
bandwidth  of  the  measurement  must  not  exceed  the  subcarrier  bandwidth  limitations,  or  sidebands  will  be
generated  in  adjacent  channels,  thereby  reducing  the  accuracy  of  other  measurements  (if  multiplexed),  or
interference with adjacent RF signals will be caused.
