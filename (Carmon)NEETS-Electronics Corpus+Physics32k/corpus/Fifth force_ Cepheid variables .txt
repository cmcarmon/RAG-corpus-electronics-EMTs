In 2012 Bhuvnesh Jain and others examined existing data on the rate of pulsation of cepheid variable stars in 25 galaxies comprising over a thousand stars in all. Theory suggests that the rate of pulsation would follow a different pattern in galaxies screened from a hypothetical 5th force by neighbourhood clusters from those that are not screened. They were unable to find any variation from Einsteinâ€™s theory of gravity.
