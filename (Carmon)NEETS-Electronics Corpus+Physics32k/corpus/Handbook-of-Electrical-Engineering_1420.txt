The excitation is usually modeled as either a mixture or a choice of random noise and periodic waveform.
For  human  speech,  voiced  excitation  occurs  when  the  vocal  folds  in  the  larynx  vibrate;  unvoiced  excitation
occurs at constrictions in the vocal tract which create turbulent air ﬂow [Flanagan, 1965]. The relative mix of
these  two  types  of  excitation  is  termed “voicing.”  In  addition,  the  periodic  excitation  is  characterized  by  a
fundamental frequency, termed pitch or F0. The excitation is scaled by a factor designed to produce the proper
amplitude or level of the speech signal. The scaled excitation function is then ﬁltered to produce the proper
spectral characteristics. While the ﬁlter may be nonlinear, it is usually modeled as a linear function.
