Figure 9.1.4 shows the transfer characteristic of a BJT switch relating Vi and Vo, whereas
Figure 9.1.5 depicts a plot of a typical input-voltage waveform and the resulting output-voltage
waveform, illustrating the essential inherent inversion property of the switch, the waveform
distortion, propagation delays, and rise and fall times of the BJT switch. Note the following
time parameters.
