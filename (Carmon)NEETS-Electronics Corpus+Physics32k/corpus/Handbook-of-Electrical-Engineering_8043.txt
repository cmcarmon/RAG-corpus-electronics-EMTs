System Components. 
In addition to the microprocessor and storage capability, the typical retail terminal has
one or more input devices for entering prices (e.g., keyboard, bar code scanner) and one or more output devices
for displaying totals (e.g., paper tape, display). Often these terminals are part of a large network of terminals
and may support additional features beyond totaling purchases such as automated inventory control and credit
checking.  A  complete  system  is  shown  in  Fig.  82.1,  including  magnetic  tape  for  storing  transactions  and  a
universal  asynchronous  receiver/transmitter  (UART)  for  communication  with  a  central  processing  facility.
Because of the high unit volume, it is desirable to keep the cost and complexity low. Typically, each terminal
will have limited storage capability, relying on a central processor for maintaining store inventory and credit
checks. In order to reduce communication trafÔ¨Åc with the central processor, however, each terminal generally
has in storage the current price for all items.
