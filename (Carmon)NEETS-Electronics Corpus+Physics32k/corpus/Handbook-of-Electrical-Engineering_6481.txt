Converting microwaves into intensity-modulated (IM) light allows the use of optical ﬁber for transmission
in place of bulky inﬂexible coaxial cable or microwave waveguide. Since the ﬁber attenuation is 0.2–0.4 dB/km,
compared with several decibels per meter for waveguide, entirely new applications and architectures are possible.
In addition, the signal is conﬁned tightly to the core of single-mode ﬁber, where it is immune to electromagnetic
interference, cross talk, or spectral regulatory control.
