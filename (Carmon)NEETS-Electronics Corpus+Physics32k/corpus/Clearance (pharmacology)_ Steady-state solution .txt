The solution to the above differential equation (9) at time infinity (steady state) is:

{\displaystyle C_{\infty }={\frac {\dot {m}}{K}}\qquad (10a)}

The above equation (10a) can be rewritten as:




K

{\displaystyle K={\frac {\dot {m}}{C_{\infty }}}\qquad (10b)}

The above equation (10b) makes clear the relationship between mass removal and clearance. It states that (with a constant mass generation) the concentration and clearance vary inversely with one another. If applied to creatinine (i.e. creatinine clearance), it follows from the equation that if the serum creatinine doubles the clearance halves and that if the serum creatinine quadruples the clearance is quartered.
