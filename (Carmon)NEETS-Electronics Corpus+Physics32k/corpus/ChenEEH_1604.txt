types, tastes, and textures of dishes. The output is a recipe that
satisﬁes these constraints. For example, the input may be
‘‘create a crisp pork dish;
include broccoli; use stir-fry
method.’’ CHEF looks in its case base for a recipe that makes
a similar meal and then adapts it to solve the new problem. If it
already has a recipe for pork with cabbage, it may copy the
recipe and substitute broccoli for cabbage. However, broccoli
may not remain crisp if cooked like cabbage. Thus, the way of
stir-frying may be modiﬁed, for example, by using rules from
other cases involving crisp broccoli.
