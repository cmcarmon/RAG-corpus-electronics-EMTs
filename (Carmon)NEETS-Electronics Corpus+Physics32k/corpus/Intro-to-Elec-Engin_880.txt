where kh is a proportionality constant dependent on the characteristics of iron, f is the frequency of
excitation in hertz, and Bm is the maximum value of the core ï¬‚ux density. This loss component of
the core loss can be reduced by choosing a core of electrical steel that has a narrow hysteresis loop.
Square-loop magnetic materials (such as ferrites and permalloy) that have a nearly rectangular
hysteresis loop are used in switching circuits, as storage elements in computers, and in special
types of transformers in electronic circuits.
