In view (A) the transformer is loosely coupled; the frequency response curve shows a narrow
bandwidth. In view (B) the transformer has optimum coupling; the bandwidth is wider and the curve is
relatively flat. In view (C) the transformer is overcoupled; the frequency response curve shows a broad
bandpass, but the curve "dips" in the middle showing that these frequencies are not developed as well as
others in the bandwidth.
