A parallel-LC circuit is often called a TANK CIRCUIT because it can store energy much as a tank 
stores liquid. It has the ability to take energy fed to it from a power source, store this energy alternately in 
the inductor and capacitor, and produce an output which is a continuous a.c. wave. You can understand 
how this is accomplished by carefully studying the sequence of events shown in figure 1-8. You must 
thoroughly understand the capacitor and inductor action in this figure before you proceed further in the 
study of parallel-resonant circuits.
