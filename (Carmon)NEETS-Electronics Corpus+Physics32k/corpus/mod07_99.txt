When ball number 1 is removed from the tube, a hole is left. This hole is then filled by ball number
2, which leaves still another hole. Ball number 3 then moves into the hole left by ball number 2. This
causes still another hole to appear where ball 3 was. Notice the holes are moving to the right side of the
tube. This action continues until all the balls have moved one space to the left in which time the hole
moved eight spaces to the right and came to rest at the right-hand end of the tube.
