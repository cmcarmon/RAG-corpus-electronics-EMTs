Types of analysis 
 
Various  types  of  analysis  are  available  within 
modern  SPICE-based  circuit  simulation  packages 
(see Appendix 7).  These usually include: 
 
DC analysis 
 
DC analysis determines the DC operating point of 
the  circuit  under  investigation.  In  this  mode  any 
wound 
and 
transformers) are short-circuited and any capacitors  
that may be present are left open-circuit. In order to 
determine  the  initial  conditions,  a  DC  analysis  is  
usually automatically performed prior to a transient 
analysis. It is also usually performed prior to an AC 
small-signal  analysis 
the 
linearized,  small-signal  models  for  non-linear 
devices.    Furthermore,  if  specified,  the  DC  small-
signal  value  of  a  transfer  function  (ratio  of  output 
variable  to  input  source),  input  resistance,  and 
output resistance is also computed as a part of the 
DC solution.  The DC analysis can also be used to 
generate  DC  transfer  curves  in  which  a  specified 
independent  voltage  or  current  source  is  stepped 
over  a  user-specified  range  and  the  DC  output 
variables  are  stored  for  each  sequential  source 
value. 
 
AC small-signal analysis 
 
The  AC  small-signal  analysis  feature  of  SPICE 
software  computes  the  AC  output  variables  as  a 
function of frequency.  The program first computes 
the  circuit  and 
the  DC  operating  point  of
