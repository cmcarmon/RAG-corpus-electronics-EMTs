Understanding that electricity can really hurt
By far, the single most dangerous aspect of working with electronics is the 
possibility of electrocution. Electrical shock results when the body reacts 
to an electrical current â€” this reaction can include an intense contraction 
of muscles (namely, the heart) and extremely high heat at the point of con-
tact between your skin and the electrical current. The heat leads to burns 
that can cause death or disfigurement. Even small currents can disrupt your 
heartbeat.
