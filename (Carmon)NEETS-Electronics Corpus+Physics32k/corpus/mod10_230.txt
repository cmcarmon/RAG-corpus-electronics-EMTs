As the voltage approaches zero (view B), some of the lines collapse back into the antenna. At the 
same time, the ends of other lines begin to come together to form a complete loop. Notice the direction of 
these lines of force next to the antenna in view C. At this point the voltage on the antenna is zero. As the 
charge starts to build up in the opposite direction (view D), electric lines of force again begin at the 
positive end of the antenna and stretch to the negative end of the antenna. These lines of force, being in 
the same direction as the sides of the closed loops next to the antenna, repel the closed loops and force 
them out into space at the speed of light. As these loops travel through space, they generate a magnetic 
field in phase with them.
