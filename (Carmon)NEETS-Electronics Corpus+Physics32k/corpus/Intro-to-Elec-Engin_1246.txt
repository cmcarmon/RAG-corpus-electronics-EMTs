13.2.21 A three-phase, 2200-V, 60-Hz, delta-connected,
squirrel-cage induction motor, when started at
full rated voltage, takes a starting current of 693
A from the line and develops a starting torque of
6250 N Â· m.
(a) Neglect the impedance and the exciting cur-
rent of the compensator. Calculate the ra-
tio of a starting compensator (i.e., an auto-
transformer starter) such that the current sup-
plied by the 2200-V line is 300 A. Compute
the starting torque with the starting compen-
sator.
