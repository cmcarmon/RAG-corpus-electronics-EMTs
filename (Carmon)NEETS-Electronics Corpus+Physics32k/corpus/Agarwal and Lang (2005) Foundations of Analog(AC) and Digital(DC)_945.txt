As in the OFF state, the current iG into the gate terminal is zero, reflecting
an open circuit both between the gate and the source, and the gate and the
drain.
As mentioned earlier, the region of operation in which vDS ≥ (vGS − VT)
is called the saturation region. The region in which vDS < (vGS − VT) is
called the triode region. The characteristics of the MOSFET in the saturation
region according to the SCS model are summarized graphically in Figure 7.16.
Compare these characteristics with those for the SR model in the triode region
displayed earlier in Figure 6.31.
