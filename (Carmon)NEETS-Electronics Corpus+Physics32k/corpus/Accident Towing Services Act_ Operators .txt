Part 4 of the Accident Towing Services Act establishes a licensing scheme for accident tow trucks. The Act makes it an offence for a person to operate a tow truck for accident towing purposes unless the person who provides the service has a "regular tow truck licence". In addition, the person must operate the truck from a depot specified in the licence and must hold a towing operator accreditation. The tow truck must be registered and be capable of being used for towing services activity.
