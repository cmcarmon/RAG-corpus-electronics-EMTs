The  base  current  of  the  bipolar  transistor  in 
Figure  10-10,  which  passes  through  LED1,  is 
very small, especially when the pot is set to its 
maximum resistance. If you’d like to measure 
this teeny current, you can do it in these differ-
ent ways:
▶✓▶ Make the measurement directly, by setting 
your multimeter to DC amps, breaking the 
circuit on one side of LED1, and inserting 
your multimeter in series with LED1. (The 
current is so small that it may not register 
on your meter.)
