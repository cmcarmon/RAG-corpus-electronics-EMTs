Since a practical oscillator must oscillate at a predetermined frequency, a FREQUENCY-
DETERMINING DEVICE (fdd), sometimes referred to as a FREQUENCY-DETERMINING 
NETWORK (fdn), is needed. This device acts as a filter, allowing only the desired frequency to pass. 
Without a frequency-determining device, the stage will oscillate in a random manner, and a constant 
frequency will not be maintained.
