Self-gravity has important implications in the field of seismology as well because the Earth is large enough that it can have elastic waves that are large enough to change the gravity within the Earth as the waves interact with large scale subsurface structures. There are models made that depend on the use of the spectral element method and these simulations take into account the effects of self-gravitation because it can have a large influence on results for certain receiver-source configurations and creates complications in the wave equation, particularly for long period waves. This kind of accuracy is critical in developing accurate 3-D crustal models in a spherical body (Earth) in the field of seismology, which allows for more accurate and higher quality interpretations to be drawn from data. The influence of self-gravity (and gravity) alters the importance of Primary (P) and Secondary (S) waves in seismology because when gravity is not taken into account, the S wave becomes more dominant and as gravity is taken into account, the effects of the S wave become less significant.
