Although the emitter follower possesses excellent wideband response characteristics, it should be noted in
Eq.  (28.48)  that  the  internal  collector  resistance,  Rc,  incurs  some  Miller  multiplication  of  the  base-collector
junction  capacitance,  Cm.  For  this  reason,  monolithic  common  collector  ampliÔ¨Åers  work  best  in  broadband
impedance buffering applications when they exploit transistors that have collector sinker diffusions and buried
collector layers, which collectively serve to minimize the parasitic internal collector resistance.
