Increasing  the  distance  an  electric  vehicle  can  travel  on  a  single  charge  is  the  most  signiﬁcant  factor  in
expanding  the  market  for  electric  vans.  The  60-mile  (97-km)  range  of  the  Griffon  makes  it  a  replacement
candidate for about 600,000 commercial ﬂeet vehicles now operating in the United States. If advanced batteries
doubled the range of a van to 120 miles, the potential market for these vehicles could top 2 million. A variety
of electric cars has been introduced over the years, but none have enjoyed general use.
