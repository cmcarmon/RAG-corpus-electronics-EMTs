Fiber optics are a relatively new type of transmission media. Figure 2-31 depicts a typical fiber-optic
cable design. The core of the fiber-optic cable is the optical transmission path, which carries data from the
optical transmitter to the optical receiver. The core is usually made of plastic, glass, or plastic-clad silica
(PCS). Glass-core fibers are usually smaller in diameter than plastic or PCS cores. The major
disadvantages of glass cores are that they have high attenuation (25 dB/km), require precision tools and
connectors, and are extremely susceptible to mechanical damage. Plastic cores are typically more rugged
than other types of cores, but their attenuation is high (35 dB/km). PCS cores are fairly rugged and have a
relatively low attenuation (10 dB/km). A fiber-optic cable may consist of one fiber, multiples of single-
optical fibers, or bundles of optical fibers. Fiber-optic cables are well suited for the transmission of high-
speed data over relatively short distances. They are virtually immune to crosstalk or interference through
inductance. (Interference is a characteristic of metallic cables.)
