A wingover is typically executed from level flight or a slight bank in the direction of the turn. Lower-powered aircraft may begin the maneuver from a shallow dive, to increase airspeed. The pilot then pulls back on the stick bringing the plane up into a steep climb, typically not exceeding 2 to 3 g's. When the plane reaches a proper attitude (nose position above the horizon), which may be between 60 and 90 degrees, or even past vertical as much as 120 degrees, the pilot relaxes the elevator input, allowing the plane to lose airspeed as it climbs in altitude. Slight rudder will usually be applied at this time to increase the bank. In a vertical climb, the term "bank" refers to the angle of the horizon to the wingline (an imaginary line running through the center of the aircraft at the 3:00 and 9:00 positions, parallel to the wings), and the increased bank causes fuselage to angle sideways and the nose to try dropping to one side. When performing the maneuver at transonic or supersonic speeds, extra help may be needed in slowing the airspeed, such a deploying the speedbrakes.
When the airspeed is low enough, the pilot applies hard rudder input with the pedals, bringing the plane into a sweeping flat-turn, as if pivoting on the lower wingtip while the upper wing cartwheels over the top. Because one wing is moving faster than the other, it will have a tendency to impart some roll onto the aircraft, so slight aileron will usually need to be applied during the turn to keep the plane from rolling. When the plane reaches a nose-down bank and attitude, the pilot releases rudder and dives, pulling back on the stick to level the plane out at the original altitude.
