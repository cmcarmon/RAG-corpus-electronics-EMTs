*15.3.28 Apply Equation (15.3.24) for various digital com-
munication systems with Eb/N0 = 12, and using
PSK as the reference, compare their performances.
15.3.29 A communication system for a voice-band (3 kHz)
channel is designed for a received SNR Eb/N0 at
the detector of 30 dB when the transmitter power is
Ps = âˆ’3 dBW. Find the value of Ps if it is desired
to increase the bandwidth of the system to 10 kHz,
while maintaining the same SNR at the detector.
