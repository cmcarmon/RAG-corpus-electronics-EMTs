Klystron amplification, power output, and efficiency can be greatly improved by the addition of 
intermediate cavities between the input and output cavities of the basic klystron. Additional cavities serve 
to velocity-modulate the electron beam and produce an increase in the energy available at the output. 
Since all intermediate cavities in a multicavity klystron operate in the same manner, a representative 
THREE-CAVITY KLYSTRON will be discussed.
