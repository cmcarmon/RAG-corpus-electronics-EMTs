To perform decoding when errors occur, we want to ﬁnd the codeword (one of the ﬁlled circles in Fig-
ure 6.22) that has the highest probability of occurring: the one closest to the one received. Note that if a data
word lies a distance of one from two codewords, it is impossible to determine which codeword was actually
sent. This criterion means that if any two codewords are two bits apart, then the code cannot correct the
channel-induced error. Thus, to have a code that can correct all single-bit errors, codewords must
have a minimum separation of three. Our repetition code has this property.
