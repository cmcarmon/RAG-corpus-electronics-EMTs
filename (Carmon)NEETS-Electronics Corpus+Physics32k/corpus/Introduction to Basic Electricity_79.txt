altered,	its	ability	of	carrying	power	from	a	point	to	the	next	is	altered,	too.
Especially	if	there	are	3	branches	in	a	circuit’s	system,	the	power	that	circulates	is
known	to	form	a	closed	loop.
The	Star	Delta	Transformation	refers	to	2	kinds	of	circuit	transformations.	The	first
circuit	transformation	is	a	star	transformation,	which	can	be	described	by	a	“Y”
formation;	the	second	circuit	transformation	is	a	delta	transformation,	which	can
be	described	by	a	triangular	pattern.
Moreover,	the	Star-Delta	Transformation	describes	a	3-phase	network	of	circuits,
which	can	explain	power	transfer	between	these	3	networks.	It	enables	the
conversion	of	impedances	that	are	connected	to	each	other.	With	the	theory	as
basis,	alongside	getting	a	clear	scope	for	power	transfer	analysis,	solving	various
concerns	can	be	accomplished,	too;	the	concept	is	applicable	to	different	types	of
circuits	including	series	circuits,	bridge-type	networks,	resistive	circuits,	and
parallel	circuits.
The	Star-Delta	Transformation	can	be	converted	to	the	Delta-Star	Transformation.
From	the	star	or	Y-formation,	the	circuit	creates	a	triangular	network	as	the
transition	is	achieved.
