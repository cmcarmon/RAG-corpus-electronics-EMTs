If the source were left with nothing connected across its terminals, then, in
theory at least, the terminal voltage must rise to infinity because the constant
current flowing through an infinite resistance gives infinite voltage. Recall the
analogous problem with the ideal voltage source: If a short circuit is applied,
the terminal current must become infinite.
