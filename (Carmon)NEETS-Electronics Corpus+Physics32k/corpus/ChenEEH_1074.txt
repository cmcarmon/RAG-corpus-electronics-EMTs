Micro electro mechanical systems are devices that have static
or moveable components with some dimensions on the scale
of a micrometer to nanometer. For comparison, a human hair
is about 80 micrometers in diameter. MEMS combine micro-
electronics and micromechanics and sometimes microoptics
and micromagnetics. A decade ago, hundreds of MEMS com-
ponents were prototyped and dozens were commercially avail-
able. Many people then viewed the technology as the classical
‘‘solution looking for a problem to solve.’’ The situation
changed markedly during the 1990s when the market for
MEMS took off in a manner reminiscent of the sales growth
of integrated circuits in the 1960s. At present, roughly 100
million MEMS components are being sold annually. Patents
on MEMS are being granted at the global rate of about one per
workday or 200 annually. While MEMS devices will not be
used as commonly as integrated circuits, they will be found in
a great diversity of products and installations. Just as most
people in technological societies own products with integrated
circuits and microlasers, pervasive ownership and use of
MEMS are clearly in prospect. It is estimated that there are
1.6 MEMS devices per person in the United States (1). Micro-
mechanical devices will both improve the performance of
existing systems and enable entirely new applications.
