Note: Part of this problem is to describe what the problem is. How should accuracy be
specified? Is there an error level that is clearly unacceptable? Does your product avoid
that error level? Is there an obvious ‘‘worst case’’ that can be easily analyzed? Have fun.
And remember, common sense is an important ingredient of sound engineering.
p r o b l e m 3.15 You have a 6-volt battery (assumed ideal) and a 1.5-volt flashlight
bulb, which is known to draw 0.5 A when the bulb voltage is 1.5 V (in Figure 3.146).
Design a network of resistors to go between the battery and the bulb to give vs = 1.5 V
when the bulb is connected, yet ensures that vs does not rise above 2 V when the bulb
is disconnected.
