The ﬁrst step in designing or analyzing any ampliﬁer is to consider the biasing. The biasing
network consists of the power supply and the passive circuit elements surrounding the transistor
that provide the correct dc levels at the terminals. This is known as setting the Q point (quiescent
or operating point) with no signal applied. A good bias circuit must not only establish the correct
dc levels, but must maintain them in spite of changes in temperature, variations in transistor
characteristics, or any other sources of variation.
