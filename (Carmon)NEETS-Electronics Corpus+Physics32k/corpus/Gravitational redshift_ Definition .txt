Redshift is often denoted with the dimensionless variable



z



{\displaystyle z\,}
, defined as the fractional change of the wavelength

λ

e






{\displaystyle z={\frac {\lambda _{o}-\lambda _{e}}{\lambda _{e}}}}

where




λ

o





{\displaystyle \lambda _{o}\,}
is the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation (photon) as measured by the observer.




λ

e





{\displaystyle \lambda _{e}\,}
is the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation (photon) when measured at the source of emission.
The gravitational redshift of a photon can be calculated in the framework of general relativity (using the Schwarzschild metric) as

where



G


{\displaystyle G}
denotes Newton's gravitational constant,



M


{\displaystyle M}
the mass of the gravitating body,



c


{\displaystyle c}
the speed of light, and




R

e




{\displaystyle R_{e}}
the distance between the center of mass of the gravitating body and the point at which the photon is emitted. The redshift is not defined for photons emitted inside the Schwarzschild radius, the distance from the body where the escape velocity is greater than the speed of light. Therefore, this formula only applies when




R

e




{\displaystyle R_{e}}
is larger than




r

s




{\displaystyle r_{s}}
. When the photon is emitted at a distance equal to the Schwarzschild radius, the redshift will be infinitely large, and it will not escape to any finite distance from the Schwarzschild sphere. When the photon is emitted at an infinitely large distance, there is no redshift.
In the Newtonian limit, i.e. when




R

e




{\displaystyle R_{e}}
is sufficiently large compared to the Schwarzschild radius




r

s




{\displaystyle r_{s}}
, the redshift can be approximated by a binomial expansion to become
