Smart Acoustical Materials
Smart acoustical materials can be classiﬁed as those that have self-adaptive characteristics on their acoustical behavior
(such as transmission, reﬂection, and absorption of acoustical energy) by means of sensors that assess the acoustical
states  (intensity,  frequency,  response,  etc.),  along  with  a  set  of  actuators  (dampers,  exciters)  with  an  associated
control system. Again, the self-adaptive behavior of these materials is in response to ambient acoustical changes.
