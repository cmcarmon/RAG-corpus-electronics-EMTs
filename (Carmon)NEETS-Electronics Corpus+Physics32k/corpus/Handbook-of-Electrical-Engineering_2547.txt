If now CE is removed, ic ï¬‚ows entirely through RE and develops a voltage which can be observed at the emitter
ieRE  (.  icRE).  Consider  the  magnitude  of  this  voltage.  Figure  24.26(a)  shows  that  for  a  normally  operating
transistor,  the  signal  component  of  the  base-emitter  voltage DVBE  (or  vbe)  is  very  small  indeed,  whereas  the
constant component needed for biasing is normally about 0.6 to 0.7 V. That is, vbe << VBE. This implies that
the emitter voltage must always follow the base voltage but at a dc level about 0.6 to 0.7 V below it. So, if an
output signal is taken from the emitter, it is almost the same as the input signal at the base. In other words,
the voltage gain of an emitter follower is almost unity.
