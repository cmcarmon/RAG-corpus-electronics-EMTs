Transformer
A transformer is basically a static device in which two or more stationary electric circuits are
coupled magnetically, the windings being linked by a common time-varying magnetic ﬂux. All
that is really necessary for transformer action to take place is for the two coils to be so positioned
that some of the ﬂux produced by a current in one coil links some of the turns of the other coil.
Some air-core transformers employed in communications equipment are no more elaborate than
this. However, the construction of transformers utilized in power-system networks is much more
elaborate to minimize energy loss, to produce a large ﬂux in the ferromagnetic core by a current in
any one coil, and to see that as much of that ﬂux as possible links as many of the turns as possible
of the other coils on the core.
