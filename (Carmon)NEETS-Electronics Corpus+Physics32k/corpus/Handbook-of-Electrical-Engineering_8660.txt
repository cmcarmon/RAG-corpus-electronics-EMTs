FIGURE 87.7 The stack area of the 68000’s memory and the register assignments that the Think C® compiler made with
global optimization turned off. The stack is shown just after the MOVEM instruction. The items in bold are as they would
be after that instruction. While the registers all hold longwords, in typical PC/Macintosh compilers, integers are deﬁned as
words. This ﬁgure is the programmatic successor to Fig. 87.6.
