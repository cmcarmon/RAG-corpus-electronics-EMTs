The solar cell is basically a P–N junction device made 
from semiconductor materials, most commonly from 
silicon. Figure 35-3 shows the construction technique. 
The P and N layers form a P–N junction. The metal sup-
port and the metal contact act as the electrical contacts. 
It is designed with a large surface area.
