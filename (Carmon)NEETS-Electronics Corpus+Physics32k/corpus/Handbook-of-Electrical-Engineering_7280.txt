PCS can be contrasted with services already deployed in the cellular band â€” that is, the part of the spectrum
ranging from 806 to 890 MHz. This band is divided into channels of 30 kHz apiece. In North America, the
mature analog technology known as AMPS is widely deployed and provides the largest amount of coverage of
all public wireless technologies available today. However, digital wireless does in fact exist in the cellular band.
A depiction of spectral allocation can be found in Figure 75.8.
