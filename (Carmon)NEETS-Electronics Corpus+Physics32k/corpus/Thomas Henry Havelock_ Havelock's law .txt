Relationship between the refractive index



n


{\displaystyle n}
and the wavelength



λ


{\displaystyle \lambda }
of a homogeneous material that transmits light:

{\displaystyle /{(n-1)^{2}}}
, where




k


{\displaystyle k}
= constant for the material at a given temperature




B


{\displaystyle B}
= Kerr constant of the material (The Kerr constant is approximately proportional to the absolute temperature.)




λ


{\displaystyle \lambda }
= wavelength of the material




n


{\displaystyle n}
= refractive index of the material
