Transmission lines are engineered and manufactured to meet certain specifications. The most
important of these specifications relates to frequency, power-handling capabilities, and characteristic
impedance. The dielectric constant (K) of the insulating material is probably the manufacturerâ€™s most
important consideration and is the primary factor that affects the size of the coaxial cable. The formulas in
the following sections discuss some aspects of coaxial transmission-line engineering.
