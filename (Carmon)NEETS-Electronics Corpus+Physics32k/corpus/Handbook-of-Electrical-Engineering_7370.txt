For  example,  a  motor  might  be  pumping  oil  from  one  location  while  oil  pressure  is  being  measured  at
another. When the pressure reading is telemetered to a control station, a decision can be made there to reduce
pump motor speed when the pressure is too high, or a valve can be opened at still another location to direct
the oil to ï¬‚ow in another path. The decision-making controller may be an experienced pipeline dispatcher or
an automatic device.
