YITP has been playing a major role in leading the research in theoretical physics and also providing research and collaborative facilities in Japan.
Every year, YITP host a number of workshops on various topics in fundamental physics, and accommodate domestic visitors from various institutions as well as those from foreign countries.
The activity of YITP covers a wide range of fields in contemporary theoretical physics: string theory, quantum field theory, gravity, cosmology, particle physics, astrophysics, nuclear physics, statistical physics, condensed matter physics and biophysics. YITP also encourage activities in creating a new interdisciplinary field of research at the forefront of modern theoretical physics.
