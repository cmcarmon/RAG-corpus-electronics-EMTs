Radiotelephone networks are operated so frequently that many operators tend to be careless. There 
are too many instances of interception of vhf and uhf transmissions at distances of many thousands of 
miles. You may have occasion to work on or around this type of equipment. If you are ever required to 
bring any transmitter on the air for any purpose, you must be familiar with and use all the correct 
procedures.
