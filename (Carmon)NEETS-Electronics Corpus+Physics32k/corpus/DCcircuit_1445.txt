Since this is an inductive circuit, we’ll start our analysis by determining the start and end
values for current. This step is vitally important when analyzing inductive circuits, as the
starting and ending voltage can only be known after the current has been determined! With
the switch open (starting condition), there is a total (series) resistance of 3 Ω, which limits the
ﬁnal current in the circuit to 5 amps:
