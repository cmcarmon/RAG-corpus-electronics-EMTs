The connection of a typical house is shown in Fig. 65.4. The incoming secondary service drop supplies the
kW and kWh meter. The modern, mostly electronic meters measure 15-min kW demand and the kWh energy
consumption. It records the maximum power demand and energy consumption. The electrical utility maintains
the  distribution  system  up  to  the  secondary  terminals  of  the  meter.  The  homeowner  is  responsible  for  the
service panel and house wiring. The typical service panel is equipped with a main switch and circuit breaker.
The main switch permits the deenergization of the house and protects against short circuits. The smaller loads
are supplied by 120 V and the larger loads by 240 V. Each outgoing line is protected by a circuit breaker. The
neutral has to be grounded at the service panel, just past the meter. The water pipe was used for grounding in
older houses. In new houses a metal rod, driven in the earth, provides proper grounding. In addition, a separate
bare wire is connected to the ground. The ground wire connects the metal parts of the appliances and service
panel box together to protect against ground-fault-produced electric shocks.
