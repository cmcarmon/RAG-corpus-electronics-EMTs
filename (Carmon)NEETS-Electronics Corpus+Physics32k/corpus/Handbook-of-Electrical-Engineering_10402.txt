The primary computer-to-computer communications architecture has been the Open Systems Inter-
connection (OSI) Reference Model. The OSI Reference Model has been successful as a layered architecture
with well-deﬁned interfaces and speciﬁed division of functions. The Department of Defense has com-
mitted  to  adopting  an  enhanced  version  of  the  OSI  protocols,  called  the  Government  OSI  Proﬁle
(GOSIP).  OSI/GOSIP  integration  into  C3  systems  is  lagging  because  of  delays  in  accredited  vendor
implementations and the cost of upgrading the existing communications infrastructure. NATO is also
adopting standards for their joint procurement policies; to a signiﬁcant degree they overlap commercial
standards.
