Some waveguide couplers are made of a series of coupling
holes or some well-placed short slots in the common broad or
sidewall of two parallel waveguide sections (shown in Figure
7.23). This design principle is also applicable to multilayered
planar structures. In this case, coupling slots or apertures are
etched into the common ground plane(s). Hybrid planar/non-
planar design approaches can also be used for the coupling
from planar lines to nonplanar lines or vice versa.
