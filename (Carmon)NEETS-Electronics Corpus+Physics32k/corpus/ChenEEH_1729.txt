Paul Baran from the RAND Corporation ﬁrst proposed the
notion of a distributed communication network in 1964
(Schonfeld, 2000; Tanenbaum, 1996). The aim of the proposal
was to provide a communication network that could survive
the impact of a nuclear war and employ a new approach to
data communication based on packet switching. The Depart-
ment of Defense (DoD) through the Advanced Research Proj-
ects Agency (ARPA) commissioned the ARPANET in 1969.
ARPANET was initially an experimental communication net-
work that consisted of only four nodes: UCLA, UCSB, SRI, and
the University of Utah. Its popularity grew very rapidly over
the next two decades, and by the end of 1989, there were over
100,000 nodes connecting research universities and govern-
ment organizations around the world. This network later
came to be known as the Internet, and a layered protocol
architecture (i.e., Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
Protocol, or TCP/IP, ref. Model) was adopted to facilitate
services such as remote connection, ﬁle transfer, electronic
mail, and news distribution. The proliferation of the Internet
exploded over the past decade to more than 10 million nodes
since the release of the World Wide Web.
