Nodal-Voltage Method
A set of node-voltage variables that implicitly satisfy the KVL equations is selected in order to
formulate circuit equations in this nodal method of analysis. A reference (datum) node is chosen
arbitrarily based on convenience, and from each of the remaining nodes to the reference node, the
voltage drops are deÔ¨Åned as node-voltage variables. The circuit is then described completely by
the necessary number of KCL equations whose solution yields the unknown nodal voltages from
which the voltage and the current in every circuit element can be determined. Thus, the number
of simultaneous equations to be solved will be equal to one less than the number of network
nodes. All voltage sources in series with resistances are replaced by equivalent current sources
with conductances in parallel. In general, resistances may be replaced by their corresponding
conductances for convenience. Note that the nodal-voltage method is a general method of network
analysis that can be applied to any network.
