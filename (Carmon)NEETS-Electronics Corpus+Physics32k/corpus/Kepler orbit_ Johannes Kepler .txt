In 1601, Johannes Kepler acquired the extensive, meticulous observations of the planets made by Tycho Brahe. Kepler would spend the next five years trying to fit the observations of the planet Mars to various curves. In 1609, Kepler published the first two of his three laws of planetary motion. The first law states:
"The orbit of every planet is an ellipse with the sun at a focus."
More generally, the path of an object undergoing Keplerian motion may also follow a parabola or a hyperbola, which, along with ellipses, belong to a group of curves known as conic sections. Mathematically, the distance between a central body and an orbiting body can be expressed as:




r

{\displaystyle r(\theta )={\frac {a(1-e^{2})}{1+e\cos(\theta )}}}

where:




r


{\displaystyle r}
is the distance




a


{\displaystyle a}
is the semi-major axis, which defines the size of the orbit




e


{\displaystyle e}
is the eccentricity, which defines the shape of the orbit




θ


{\displaystyle \theta }
is the true anomaly, which is the angle between the current position of the orbiting object and the location in the orbit at which it is closest to the central body (called the periapsis), according to the figure above.
Alternately, the equation can be expressed as:




r
(

=


p

{\displaystyle r(\theta )={\frac {p}{1+e\cos(\theta )}}}

Where



p


{\displaystyle p}
is called the semi-latus rectum of the curve. This form of the equation is particularly useful when dealing with parabolic trajectories, for which the semi-major axis is infinite.
Despite developing these laws from observations, Kepler was never able to develop a theory to explain these motions.
