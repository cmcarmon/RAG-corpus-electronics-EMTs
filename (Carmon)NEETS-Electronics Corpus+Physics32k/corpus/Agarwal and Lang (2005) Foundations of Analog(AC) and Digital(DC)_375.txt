In the examples cited here, only a very small amount of power is needed to
control large amounts of power at the output. In the car, for example, a trivial
expenditure of energy controls hundreds of horsepower. To idealize, we assume
that zero power is required to exercise control; we call this a dependent source
or controlled source. The electrical forms of dependent sources are obvious
extensions of the sources we have already seen: a dependent voltage source that
can be controlled by some voltage or current, and a dependent current source
which likewise has a value determined by some voltage or current. Dependent
sources are most commonly used to model elements having more than two
terminals.
