The vertical attenuator control (VOLTS/DIV in figure 6-19) provides a means of adjusting the input
signal level to the amplifiers by steps. These steps are sequenced from low to high deflection factors. The
potentiometer control (VAR in figure 6-19) provides a means of fine, or variable, control between steps.
This control may be mounted separately, or it may be mounted on the attenuator control. When the
control is mounted separately, it is often marked as FINE GAIN or simply GAIN. When mounted on the
attenuator control, it is usually marked VARIABLE or VAR.
