Added ability to see travel time and weather at the event's location, with the ability to set an alarm based on the travel time
More elaborate functionality than in the past, but still incorrectly assumes that we know the time for all future events. Gives no option to not show a time, which would result appointment and event errors (which would not be appropriate for a calendar application).
