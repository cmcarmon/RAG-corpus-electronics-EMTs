Although coercivity is indeed an important parameter for magnetic recording media, it is by no means the
only one. Particle size affects the medium noise because, at any time, the head is sensing a Ô¨Åxed volume of the
medium. Because the particles are quantized and there are statistical variations in their switching behavior, the
medium power signal-to-noise ratio varies linearly with the number of particles contained in that volume. To
reduce particulate medium noise, it is therefore generally desirable to use small particles.
