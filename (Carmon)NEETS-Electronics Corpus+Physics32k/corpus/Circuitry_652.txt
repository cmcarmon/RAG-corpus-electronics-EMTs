Analogue 
conventional 
moving coil meters and the display takes the form 
of a pointer moving across a calibrated scale. This 
arrangement  is  not  so  convenient  to  use  as  that 
employed 
the 
position  of  the  pointer  is  rarely  exact  and  may 
require  interpolation.  Analogue  instruments  do, 
however,  offer  some  advantages  not  the  least  of 
which  lies  in  the  fact  that  it  is  very  easy  to  make 
adjustments  to  a  circuit  whilst  observing  the 
relative direction of the pointer; a movement in one 
direction representing an increase and in the other a 
decrease.  Despite  this,  the  principal  disadvantage 
of many analogue meters is the rather cramped, and 
sometimes 
calibration.  To 
determine  the  exact  reading  requires  first  an 
estimation  of  the  pointerâ€™s  position  and  then  the 
application of some mental arithmetic based on the 
range switch setting. 
  Digital  meters,  on  the  other  hand,  are  usually 
extremely  easy  to  read  and  have  displays  that  are 
clear,  unambiguous,  and  capable  of  providing  a 
very  high  resolution.  It 
to 
distinguish  between  readings  that  are  very  close. 
This 
just  not  possible  with  an  analogue 
instrument. Typical analogue and digital meters are 
shown in Fig. 14.6.
