Since Cs/Ct = 1 is chosen, Ct = 0.0281 mF. The actual value of Ct used on the secondary side of the
HF  transformer  =  (1.84)2  2  0.0281  =  0.09514 mF.  The  resonating  capacitors  must  be  HF  type  (e.g.,
polypropylene)  and  must  be  capable  of  withstanding  the  voltage  and  current  ratings  obtained  above
(enough safety margin must be provided).
