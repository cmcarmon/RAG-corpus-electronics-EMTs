The mass of composite fermions has been determined from the measurements of: the effective cyclotron energy of composite fermions; the temperature dependence of Shubnikovâ€“de Haas oscillations; energy of the cyclotron resonance; spin polarization of the Fermi sea; and quantum phase transitions between states with different spin polarizations. Its typical value in GaAs systems is on the order of the electron mass in vacuum. (It is unrelated to the electron band mass in GaAs, which is 0.07 of the electron mass in vacuum.)
