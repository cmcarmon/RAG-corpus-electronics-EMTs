Trends in compact communication systems to involve the
integration of antenna (including matching network) and
active circuits (such ampliﬁers) together as one component.
Chapter 11 discusses the basic principles of active integrated
circuit antennas. The basic operation of microwave transistors
(both BJT and FET) is discussed. Active circuits of ampliﬁers,
oscillators, and detectors/mixers are described. Active antennas
using microstrip patches or printed slots are also described.
