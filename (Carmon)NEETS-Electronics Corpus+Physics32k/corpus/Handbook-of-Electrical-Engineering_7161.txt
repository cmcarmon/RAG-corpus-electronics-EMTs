User access is via assignments of a frequency, time slot, or code. Fixed assigned channels allow a user unlimited
access. However, this may result in poor utilization efﬁciency for the satellite resources and may imply higher
user costs (analogous to a leased terrestrial line). Other assignment schemes include demand assigned multiple
access (DAMA) and random access (e.g., for the Aloha concept). DAMA systems require the user to ﬁrst send
a channel request over a common control channel. The network controller (at another earth station) seeks an
empty channel and instructs the sending unit to tune to it either in frequency or time slot. A link is maintained
for the call duration and then released to the system for other users to request. Random access is economical
for lightly used burst trafﬁc such as data. It relies on random time of arrival of data packets and protocols are
in place for repeat requests in the event of collisions [Gagliardi 1991].
