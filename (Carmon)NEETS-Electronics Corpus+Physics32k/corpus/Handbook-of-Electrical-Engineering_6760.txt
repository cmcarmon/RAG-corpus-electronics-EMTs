The Importance of LAN Standards
LAN standards play a central role in promoting the goal of universal connectivity among a community of users.
The  standardization  of  communication  services  and  protocols  allows  all  conforming  implementations  to
exchange information. Consequently, the importance of LAN standards has grown steadily. Currently, several
LAN standards have been established to support the different communication requirements of users.
