The analytical criterion presented in this section for the
simple system can be extended to multimachine models
using Lyapunov theory and based on the concepts of energy
functions. Development of analytical criteria for checking the
large representative dynamic models
transient stability of
remains a research area. Numerical
integration procedures
outlined in the previous sections are commonly used by the
power industry for studying the transient stability properties
of large power systems.
