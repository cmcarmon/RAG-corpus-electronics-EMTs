In all but small machines, the armature resistance is usually neglected except for its effect on
losses (and hence the efﬁciency) and heating. With this simpliﬁcation, Figure 13.3.2 shows the
four possible cases of operation of a round-rotor synchronous machine, in which the following
relation holds:
