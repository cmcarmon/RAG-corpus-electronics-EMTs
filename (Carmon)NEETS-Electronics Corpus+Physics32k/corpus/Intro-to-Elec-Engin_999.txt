The nonsalient-pole (smooth or cylindrical) rotor construction is preferred for high-speed
turbine-driven alternators (known also as turbo alternators or turbine generators), which are
usually of two or four poles driven by steam turbines or gas turbines. The rotors for such machines
may be made either from a single steel forging or from several forgings shrunk together on the
shaft.
