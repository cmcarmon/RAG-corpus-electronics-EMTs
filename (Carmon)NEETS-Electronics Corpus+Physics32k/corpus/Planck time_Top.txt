In quantum mechanics, the Planck time (tP) is the unit of time in the system of natural units known as Planck units.
Planck unit is the time required for light to travel in a vacuum a distance of 1 Planck length, which is approximately 5.39 × 10 −44 s.  The unit is named after Max Planck, who was the first to propose it.
The Planck time is defined as:





t


P



≡




ℏ
G


c

5







{\displaystyle t_{\mathrm {P} }\equiv {\sqrt {\frac {\hbar G}{c^{5}}}}}

where:
ħ = ​h⁄2 π is the reduced Planck constant (sometimes h is used instead of ħ in the definition)
G = gravitational constant
c = speed of light in a vacuum
s is the SI unit of time, the second.
Solving the above will show the approximate equivalent value of this unit with respect to the second:
