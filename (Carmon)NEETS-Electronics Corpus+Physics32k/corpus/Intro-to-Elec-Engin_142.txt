1.2.28 The inductance per unit length in H/m for parallel-
plate inﬁnitely long conductors in air is given by
L = µ0d/w = 4π ×10
−7d/w, where d and w are
in meters. Compute L (per unit length) for d = 1 m
and w = 0.113 m. See Problem 1.2.23 and show
that the product of inductance (per unit length) and
capacitance (per unit length) is µ0ε0.
