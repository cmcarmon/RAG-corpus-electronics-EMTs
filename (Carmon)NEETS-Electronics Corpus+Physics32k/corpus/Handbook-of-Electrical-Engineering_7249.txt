The research indicated a need for a ﬂexible, compatible, cost-effective, yet high-performance wireless alter-
native  to  extend  and  complement,  if  not  replace,  the  capabilities  of  wire,  cable,  and  ﬁber  for  in-building
communications networks. More speciﬁcally, it is the convenience and ﬂexibility that users need. In fact, the
aggregate need for ﬂexibility and convenience was found to be twice that of the perceived beneﬁt for cost savings.
When research respondents were asked how they could improve upon their experiences when implementing
a move, add, or change, many solutions were offered. These solutions ranged from having more compatibility
among different vendors’ equipment, to providing a better way to organize all the different cabling.
