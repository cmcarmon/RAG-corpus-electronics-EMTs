6 Pitch is actually a psychoacoustic rather than a waveform-domain concept.
Pitch is precisely deÔ¨Åned as the perceived fundamental frequency of an audible
stimulus, whether or not that fundamental frequency is actually present in the
acoustic waveform. In a telephone conversation, each conversant perceives the
fundamental voicing frequency of the other even though that frequency is
ordinarily not in the telephone channel bandwidth.
