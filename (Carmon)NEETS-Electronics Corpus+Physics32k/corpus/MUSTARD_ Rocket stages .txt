The three components of the design were three largely identical lifting bodies (each similar to the Northrop HL-10), stacked back-to-belly.
The units would be stacked for launch, and two of them would act as boosters to launch the third into Earth orbit. The booster units would feed any excess fuel to the unit which was to be the spacecraft. At 150,000 to 200,000 ft (46,000 to 61,000 m), at around 30 nautical miles, the booster units would separate and land like aircraft.
The spacecraft would place its payload into orbit at around 1000 nautical miles, after 10 minutes from launch, and then return in a like manner.
