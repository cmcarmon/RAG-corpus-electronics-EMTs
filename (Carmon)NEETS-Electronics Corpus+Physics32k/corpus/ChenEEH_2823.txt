The distinction between the design of these two classes,
however, is blurring. Microwave circuits are becoming very
complex systems comprised of densely packed elements. On
the digital-circuit side, the rise of everyday clock speeds to
3 GHz implies low-pass signal bandwidths above 10 GHz,
which are well into the microwave range. Electromagnetic
wave effects that, until now, were in the domain of the micro-
wave engineer are becoming a limiting factor in digital-circuit
operation. For example, hard-won experience has shown that
high-speed digital signals can spuriously:
