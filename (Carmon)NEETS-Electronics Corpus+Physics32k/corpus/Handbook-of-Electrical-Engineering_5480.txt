When the ordered current is too high for the converter to deliver, it will operate at the minimum Ô¨Åring angle
(usually 5 degrees). Then the current will be determined by the voltage Vd and the load. This is also referred
to as the natural voltage characteristic. The converter in this mode is equivalent to a dc voltage source with
internal resistance Rc, where
