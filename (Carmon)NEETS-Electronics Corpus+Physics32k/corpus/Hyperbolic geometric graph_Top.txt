A hyperbolic geometric graph (HGG) or hyperbolic geometric network (HGN) is special spatial network where nodes are (1) sprinkled according to a probability distribution onto a hyperbolic space of constant negative curvature and (2) an edge between two nodes is present if they are close according to a function of the metric, a HGG generalizes a random geometric graph (RGG) whose embedding space is Euclidean.
