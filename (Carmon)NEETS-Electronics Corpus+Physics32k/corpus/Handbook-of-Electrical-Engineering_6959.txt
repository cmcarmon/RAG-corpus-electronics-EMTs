Let Y(t) = g[X(t + t1), . . ., X(t + tn)], where g[·] is any nonrandom real function, so that Y(t) is a function
of a ﬁnite number of time samples of a strongly stationary process. For example, let (1) Y(t) = X(t + t1)X(t +
t2), E[Y(t)] = RXX(t1 – t2) and (2) Y(t) = 1 if X(t) < x, Y(t) = 0, otherwise, so that
