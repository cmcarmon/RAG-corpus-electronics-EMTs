(B) The distribution of the nonzero clock skews in the per-
missible range after one iteration of problem QP-2—as
described in Step 7 in Section 4.6.1—is shown in Figures
4.14(B) and 4.15(B). Note that there are frequent lower
bound and upper bound violations of the permissible
range. These violations are represented by the dark left-
most and rightmost regions, respectively, where the
number of violations is also indicated.
