The inverse modeling structure shown in Fig. 100.60 tends to force the network to represent the inverse of
the plant, but there are potential drawbacks to this approach. The training signal must be chosen to sample
over a wide range of system inputs, and the actual operational inputs may be difﬁcult to deﬁne a priori [Jordan
and Rumelhart, 1991]. This point is strongly related to the concept of persistent excitation discussed in adaptive
control literature. A second drawback is that an incorrect inverse model can be obtained if the nonlinear system
mapping is not one-to-one. An approach called specialized inverse modeling has been proposed in an effort to
overcome these problems. The details of this approach can be found in [Psaltis et al., 1988]. The neural network
identiﬁcation models can be used in the adaptive control of unknown nonlinear plants.
