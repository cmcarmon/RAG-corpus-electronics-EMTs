Skin effect was discussed in NEETS, Module 10, Introduction to Wave Propagation, Transmission 
Lines, and Antennas, Chapter 3. Skin effect tends to increase the effective resistance of the conductor. 
Although energy transfer in coaxial cable is caused by electromagnetic field motion, the magnitude of the
