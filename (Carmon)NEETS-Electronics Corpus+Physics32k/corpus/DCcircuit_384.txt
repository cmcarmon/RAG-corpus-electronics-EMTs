First, you check your meter on a known source of voltage to see that its working properly.
Any nearby power receptacle should provide a convenient source of AC voltage for a test. You
do so and Ô¨Ånd that the meter indicates as it should. Next, you need to check for voltage among
these three wires in the cabinet. But voltage is measured between two points, so where do you
check?
