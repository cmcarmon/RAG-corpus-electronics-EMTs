A transistor/diode checker 
 
A simple  transistor/diode  checker  can  make  an 
excellent  project  for  the  beginner  to  electronic 
circuit  construction.  The  instrument  shown  in  Fig. 
15.14  measures  current  gain  for  NPN  and  PNP 
transistors  up  to  1,000  and  leakage  current  up  to  
100 ÂµA. It also has a diode check facility which can 
be  useful  for  rapid  testing  of  signal,  rectifier,  and 
zener diodes. The values of R1, R2 and R3 can be 
made  from  series  combinations  of  preferred  value 
resistors  (for  example,  R2  can  be  made  from  a  
150 kH resistor connected in series with an 18  kH
resistor) whilst the meter shunt resistor, R5, should 
be  calculated  in  order  to  provide  a  full-scale 
deflection on the meter of 10 mA whenever any of 
the current gain ranges are selected (see page 246). 
Typical  front  panel  layouts  and  meter  scales  are 
shown in Figs 15.12 and 15.13.
