The Amor asteroids, named after 1221 Amor, are near-Earth asteroids that are not Earth-crossers, having a perihelion just outside the Earth's orbit.
Mars-crosser asteroids have orbits that cross that of Mars, but do not necessarily closely approach the Earth's.
Mars trojans follow or lead Mars on its orbit, at either of the two Lagrangian points 60Â° ahead (L4) or behind (L5). As of March 2008, four are known. The largest appears to be 5261 Eureka.
Many of the Earth-, Venus-, and Mercury-crosser asteroids have aphelia greater than 1 AU.
