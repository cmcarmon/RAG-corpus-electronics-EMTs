This describes the electrically controlled drum brake principles.

The brake is built with the brake shield (1) as a base that contains the mechanisim. The brake shield is mounted on an axle/spindle using the holes in the centre.
The brake shoes (3) are the items performing the braking by pressing outwards at the drum that covers all the innards.
The brake shoes are held in place by reactor springs (2) and an adjuster (7) spring. There are also some minor clips not pictured to keep the brake shoes in place.
Braking starts with applying a current proportional to the desired brake force to the electromagnet (5) which is pulled axially towards the drum. If the wheel is rotating the drum will then pull the actuating arm (4) either to the left or to the right depending on the rotation of the wheel. The actuating arm is pivoted on the black round pin that is anchored to the brake shield. This in turn applies pressure on one of the brake shoes which comes into contact with the brake drum. The first brake shoe then tries to follow the rotation while asserting friction and thereby propagate the movement onto the second brake shoe through the adjuster which also pushes against the drum. The friction force is then caught by the stopper (Black trapezoid) mounted on the brake shield.
The braking force asserted is caused by the friction between the electromagnet and the face of the drum which depends on the current through the electromagnet (as stated before). The force applied on the brake shoes is counteracted by one of the reactor springs (which one depends on the direction of the rotation) so that when the current through the electromagnet is withdrawn the spring ensures that the actuating arm is returned to its resting position and the brake shoes are retracted from the drum.
The electric current controlling the brake force is supplied by a trailer brake controller.
