Using a model to understand transistors
Exactly how a transistor works internally involves technical details about 
free electrons, moving holes, pn‐junctions, and biasing. You don’t have to 
know all that technical stuff by chapter and verse to use transistors in cir-
cuits. Instead, familiarize yourself with a functional model of a transistor, and 
you’ll know enough to get going.
