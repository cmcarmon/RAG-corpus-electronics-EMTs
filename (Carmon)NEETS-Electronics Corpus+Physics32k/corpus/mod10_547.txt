When the line is terminated in an inductance, both the current and voltage shift in phase as they
arrive at the end of the line. When XL  is equal to Z0, the resulting standing waves are as shown in figure

is increased, the standing waves appear closer to the end. When the inductive reactance is decreased, the
standing waves move away from the end of the line.
