distance can be decreased to 1/L binary digits. Note the subtle distinction here between bits, which are units
of  information,  a  property  of  the  source  alone,  and  binary  digits,  which  are  units  of  code  word  length,  and
hence only a property of the code used to represent the source. Also note that the Huffman code satisﬁes the
preﬁx condition, i.e., no code word is the preﬁx of another longer code word. This means that a stream of 0’s
and  1’s  may  be  uniquely  decoded  into  the  corresponding  sequence  of  source  symbols  without  the  need  for
markers to delineate boundaries between code words.
