Power semiconductor devices are used as switches in power
electronics applications. Ideal switches arbitrarily block large
forward and reverse voltages, with zero current ﬂow in the off-
state, arbitrarily conduct large currents with zero voltage drop in
the on-state, and have negligible switching time and power loss.
Material and design limitations prevent semiconductor devices
from operating as ideal switches. It is important to understand
the operation of these devices to determine how much the
device characteristics can be idealized. Available semiconductor
devices could be either controllable or uncontrollable. In an
uncontrollable device, such as the diode, on-and off-states are
controlled by circuit conditions. Devices like BJTs, MOSFETs,
and their combinations can be turned on and off by control
signals, and hence, are controllable devices. Thyristors belong
to an intermediate category deﬁned by latch-on being deter-
mined by a control signal and turn-off governed by external
circuit conditions. This chapter presents a summary of the
design equations, terminal characteristics, and the circuit per-
formance of contemporary and emerging power devices.
