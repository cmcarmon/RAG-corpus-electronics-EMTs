7. When working on equipment with closely spaced parts, you will find that conventional test
probes are often the cause of accidental short circuits between adjacent terminals. Momentary
short circuits, which rarely cause damage to an electron tube, may ruin a transistor. To avoid
accidental shorts, a test probe can be covered with insulation for all but a very short length of the
tip.
