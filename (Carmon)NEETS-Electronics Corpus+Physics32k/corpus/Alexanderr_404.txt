8.1
In the previous chapter we considered circuits with a single storage ele-
ment (a capacitor or an inductor). Such circuits are ﬁrst-order because
the differential equations describing them are ﬁrst-order. In this chap-
ter we will consider circuits containing two storage elements. These are
known  as  second-order circuits  because  their  responses  are  described
by differential equations that contain second derivatives.
