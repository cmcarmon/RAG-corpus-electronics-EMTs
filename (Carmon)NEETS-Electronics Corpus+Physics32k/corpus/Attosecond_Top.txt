An attosecond is 1×10−18 of a second (one quintillionth of a second). For context, an attosecond is to a second what a second is to about 31.71 billion years.
The word "attosecond" is formed by the prefix atto and the unit second. Atto- was made from the Danish word for eighteen (atten). Its symbol is as.
An attosecond is equal to 1000 zeptoseconds, or ​1⁄1000 of a femtosecond. Because the next higher SI unit for time is the femtosecond (10−15 seconds), durations of 10−17 s and 10−16 s will typically be expressed as tens or hundreds of attoseconds:
Times which can be expressed in attoseconds:
1 attosecond: the time it takes for light to travel the length of two hydrogen atoms
12 attoseconds: record for shortest time interval measured as of 12 May 2010
24 attoseconds: the atomic unit of time
43 attoseconds: the shortest pulses of laser light yet created
53 attoseconds: the second shortest pulses of laser light created
100 attoseconds: fastest ever view of molecular motion
200 attoseconds (approximately): half-life of beryllium-8, maximum time available for the triple-alpha process for the synthesis of carbon and heavier elements in stars
320 attoseconds: estimated time it takes electrons to transfer between atoms.
