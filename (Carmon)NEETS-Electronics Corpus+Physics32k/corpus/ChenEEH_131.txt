and J i is called the Jacobian of the system, and Dvi is the
change in the solution at the ith iteration. From the solution
of equation 3.9, Dvi is obtained and viþ1 ¼ vi þ Dvi is com-
puted. Note that equation 3.9 is a linear system of equations,
and the Jacobian can be created using circuit stamps, as done
