Distance is not the only quantity relevant in determining the difference between absolute and apparent magnitude. Absorption is another important factor and it may even be a dominant one in particular cases (e. g. in the direction of the galactic center).
Thus a distinction is made between distance moduli uncorrected for interstellar absorption (whose values would overestimate the distance if used naively) and absorption-corrected moduli.
The first ones are termed visual distance moduli and are denoted by





(
m
−
M
)


v




{\displaystyle {(m-M)}_{v}}
while the second ones are called true distance moduli and denoted by





(
m
−
M
)


0




{\displaystyle {(m-M)}_{0}}
.
Visual distance moduli are computed by calculating the difference between the observed apparent magnitude and some theoretical estimate of the absolute magnitude. True distance moduli require a further theoretical step, that is the estimation of the interstellar absorption coefficient.
