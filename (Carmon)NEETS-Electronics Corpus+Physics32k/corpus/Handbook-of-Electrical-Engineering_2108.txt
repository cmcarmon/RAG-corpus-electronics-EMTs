Motion Analysis or Tracking
The fourth function of underwater acoustic signal processing is to perform contact (or target) motion analysis
(TMA), that is, to estimate parameters of bearing and speed. Generally, nonlinear ﬁltering methods, including
Kalman-Bucy  ﬁlters,  are  applied;  typically  these  methods  rely  on  a  state  space  model  for  the  motion  of  the
contact. For example, the underlying model of motion could assume a straight-line course and constant speed
of the contact of interest. When the acoustic source of interest behaves like the model, then results consistent
with the basic theory can be expected. It is also possible to incorporate motion compensation into the signal
processing detection function. For example, in the active sonar case, proper waveform selection and processing
can  reduce  the  degradation  of  detector  performance  caused  by  uncompensated  Doppler.  Moreover,  joint
detection and estimation can provide clues to the TMA and classiﬁcation processes. For example, if the processor
simultaneously estimates depth in the process of performing detection, then a submerged object would not be
classiﬁed  as  a  surface  object.  Also,  joint  detection  and  estimation  using  Doppler  for  detection  can  directly
improve contact motion estimates.
