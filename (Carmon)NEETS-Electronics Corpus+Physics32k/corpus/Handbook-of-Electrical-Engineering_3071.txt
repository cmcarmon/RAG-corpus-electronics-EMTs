Circuit Realizations
Various electronic circuits can be found to implement any given transfer function. Cascade ﬁlters and ladder
ﬁlters are two of the basic approaches for obtaining a practical circuit. Cascade realizations are much easier to
ﬁnd and to tune, but ladder ﬁlters are less sensitive to element variations. In cascade realizations, the transfer
function is simply factored into ﬁrst- and second-order parts. Circuits are built for the individual parts and
then cascaded to produce the overall ﬁlter. For simple to moderately complex ﬁlter designs, this is the most
common method, and the remainder of this section is devoted to several examples of the circuits used to obtain
