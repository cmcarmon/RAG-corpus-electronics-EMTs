Let a particle P of mass m  move in a two-dimensional Euclidean space (planar motion). Suppose that C is the curve traced out by P and s is the arc length of C corresponding to time t. Let O be an arbitrary origin in the plane and {i,j} be a fixed orthonormal basis. The position vector of the particle is

{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} =r\mathbf {e} _{r}.}

where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to the arc length s, and κ is the curvature function of the curve C. In general, Sr and St are not equal to the orthogonal projections of a onto er and et.
