Two of the most important parameters used for transistor testing are the transistor CURRENT GAIN
(BETA) and the COLLECTOR LEAKAGE or REVERSE CURRENT (ICO). Two other tests that can be
accomplished include the electrode resistance and diode measurements. You may want to review NEETS,
Module 7, Introduction to Solid-State Devices and Power Supplies, for a review of transistors before
continuing this section.
