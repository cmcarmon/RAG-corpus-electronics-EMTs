bit oversimplified, as you may already suspect. Actually, only one current flows. Because the counter emf 
can never become as large as the applied voltage, and because they are of opposite polarity as we have 
seen, the counter emf effectively cancels part of the armature voltage. The single current that flows is 
armature current, but it is greatly reduced because of the counter emf.
