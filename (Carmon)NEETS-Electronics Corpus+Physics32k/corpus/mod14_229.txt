If we apply two variables, A and B, to the inputs of the AND gate, then both A and B would have to
be TRUE at the same time to produce the desired TRUE output. . The symbol f designates the output
function. The Boolean expression for this operation is f = AÂ·B or f = AB. The expression is spoken, "f =
A AND B." The dot, or lack of, indicates the AND function.
