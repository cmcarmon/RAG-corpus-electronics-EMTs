We notice that each of the diagonal terms is the sum of the resistances
in  the  related  mesh,  while  each  of  the  off-diagonal  terms  is  the  nega-
tive  of  the  resistance  common  to  meshes  1  and  2.  Each  term  on  the
right-hand  side  of  Eq.  (3.24)  is  the  algebraic  sum  taken  clockwise  of
all independent voltage sources in the related mesh.
