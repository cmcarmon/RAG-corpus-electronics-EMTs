If the complex envelope g(t) is desired for generalized signal detection or for optimum reception in digital
systems, the x(t) and y(t) quadrature components, where x(t) + jy(t) = g(t), may be obtained by using quadrature
product  detectors,  as  illustrated  in  Fig. 69.4. x(t)  and y(t)  could  be  fed  into  a  signal  processor  to  extract  the
modulation information. Disregarding the effects of noise, the signal processor could recover m(t) from x(t)
and y(t) (and, consequently, demodulate the IF signal) by using the inverse of the complex envelope generation
functions given in Table 69.1.
