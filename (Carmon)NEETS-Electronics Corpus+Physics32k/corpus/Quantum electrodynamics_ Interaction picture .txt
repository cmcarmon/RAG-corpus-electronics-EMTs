This theory can be straightforwardly quantized by treating bosonic and fermionic sectors as free. This permits us to build a set of asymptotic states which can be used to start a computation of the probability amplitudes for different processes. In order to do so, we have to compute an evolution operator that, for a given initial state

i

{\displaystyle |i\rangle }
, will give a final state

{\displaystyle \langle f|}
in such a way to have

{\displaystyle M_{fi}=\langle f|U|i\rangle .}

This technique is also known as the S-matrix. The evolution operator is obtained in the interaction picture where time evolution is given by the interaction Hamiltonian, which is the integral over space of the second term in the Lagrangian density given above:

{\displaystyle V=e\int d^{3}x{\bar {\psi }}\gamma ^{\mu }\psi A_{\mu }}

{\displaystyle U=T\exp \left[-{\frac {i}{\hbar }}\int _{t_{0}}^{t}dt'V(t')\right]}

where T is the time ordering operator. This evolution operator only has meaning as a series, and what we get here is a perturbation series with the fine structure constant as the development parameter. This series is called the Dyson series.
