Years of study and heated debate preceded the start-up of the ﬁrst Niagara Falls Power Station in the
summer  of  1895,  as  engineers  and  ﬁnanciers  argued  about  whether  electricity  could  be  relied  on  to
transmit  large  amounts  of  power  the  20  miles  to  Buffalo  and,  if  so,  whether  it  should  be  direct  or
alternating  current.  The  success  of  the  giant  polyphase  alternating  current  generators  made  clear  the
directions  that  electric  power  technology  would  take  in  the  new  century,  and  the  attraction  of  novel
industries  that  consumed  great  amounts  of  electricity,  such  as  aluminum  and  other  electrochemical
manufacturers,  showed  the  vast  potential  for  growth  and  change  that  electricity  held  for  the  future.
