Optical Ampliﬁers
The performance of optical ampliﬁers has improved signiﬁ-
cantly—with current ampliﬁers providing signiﬁcantly lower
noise and ﬂatter gain—which is essential to DWDM systems.
The total power of ampliﬁers also has steadily increased, with
ampliﬁers approaching þ20-dBm outputs, which is many
orders of magnitude more powerful than the ﬁrst ampliﬁers.
