not completely understood. However, for the sake of convenience, it has been arbitrarily divided (based primarily
on anatomical considerations) into the following areas: frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, and occipital
lobe  (Fig.  115.2).  Each  of  these  segments  of  the  cortex,  which  is  the  source  of  intellectual  and  imaginative
capacities, includes millions of neurons and a host of interconnections.
