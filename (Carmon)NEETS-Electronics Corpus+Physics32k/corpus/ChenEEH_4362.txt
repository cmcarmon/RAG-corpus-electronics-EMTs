Whether a linear system is stable or unstable is a property of
the system itself and does not depend on the input or driving
function of the system. The poles of the input or driving
function do not affect the property of stability of the system,
but they contribute only to steady-state response terms in the
solution. Thus, the problem of closed-loop stability can be
solved readily by choosing no closed-loop poles in the right
half of the s plane, including the jv axis.
