There is a direct relationship between the transducer frequency transfer function and the transducer conduc-
tance. Consider an interdigital transducer (IDT) with uniform overlap electrodes having Np interaction pairs.
Each  gap  between  alternating  polarity  electrodes  is  considered  a  localized  SAW  source.  The  SAW  impulse
response at the fundamental frequency will be continuous and of duration t, where t = N Â· Dt, and h(t) is given by
