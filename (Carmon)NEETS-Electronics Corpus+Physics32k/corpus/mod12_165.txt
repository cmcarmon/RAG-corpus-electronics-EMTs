If the same 100-kilohertz carrier is modulated by a 10-kilohertz audio tone, sideband frequencies will 
appear at 90 and 110 kilohertz and the signal will have a bandwidth of 20 kilohertz. Notice that as the 
modulating signal becomes higher in frequency, the bandwidth required also becomes greater. As 
illustrated by the above examples, the bandwidth of an amplitude-modulated wave at any instant is two 
times the highest modulating frequency applied at that time. Thus, if a 400-kilohertz carrier is modulated 
with 3, 5, and 8 kilohertz simultaneously, sideband frequencies will appear at 392, 395, 397, 403, 405, 
and 408 kilohertz. This signal extends from 392 to 408 kilohertz and has a bandwidth of 16 kilohertz, 
twice the highest modulating frequency of 8 kilohertz.
