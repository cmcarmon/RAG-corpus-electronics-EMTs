The best-known algorithms are the D-algorithm (precursor to all), PODEM, and FAN [Abramovici, 1992].
Three steps can be identiÔ¨Åed in most automatic test pattern generation (ATPG) programs: (1) listing the signals
on the inputs of a gate controlling the line on which a fault should be detected, (2) determining the primary
input conditions necessary to obtain these signals (back propagation) and sensitizing the path to the primary
outputs such that the signals and fault can be observed, and (3) repeating this procedure until all detectable
faults in a given fault set have been covered. PODEM and FAN introduce powerful heuristics to speed the three
steps  by  aiding  in  the  sequential  selection  of  faults  to  be  examined  and  by  cutting  the  amount  of  back  and
forward propagation necessary.
