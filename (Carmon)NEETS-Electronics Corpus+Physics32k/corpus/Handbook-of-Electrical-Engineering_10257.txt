Displays
All  modern  avionics  systems  use  electronic  displays,  either  CRTs  or  ﬂat-panel  LCDs  that  offer  exceptional
ﬂexibility in display format and signiﬁcantly higher reliability than electromechanical displays. Because of the
very  bright  ambient  sunlight  at  ﬂight  altitudes  the  principal  challenge  for  an  electronic  display  is  adequate
brightness. CRTs achieve the required brightness through the use of a shadow mask design coupled with narrow
bandpass  optical  ﬁlters.  Flat-panel  LCDs  also  use  narrow  bandpass  optical  ﬁlters  and  a  bright  backlight  to
achieve the necessary brightness.
