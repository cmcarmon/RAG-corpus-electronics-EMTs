Future CACSD environments will have to give equal emphasis to “control data objects” as they now do for
matrices. This is becoming urgent as the number of specialist toolboxes being written for MATLAB and similar
packages  increases.  Only  by  having  a  set  of  commonly  approved  data-types  can  the  further  development  of
incompatible data formats 
 be prevented. Rimvall has deﬁned an extended MATLAB-
compatible command language to overcome such problems and the issues are discussed in [Rimvall and Wette,
1993].
