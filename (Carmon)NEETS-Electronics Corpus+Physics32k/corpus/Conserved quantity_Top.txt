In mathematics, a function H of the dependent variables with a constant along each trajectory of the system takes the name conserved quantity of a dynamical system used for qualitative analysis. Not all systems have conserved quantities, however the existence has nothing to do with linearity, a simplifying trait in a system. This means finding and examining conserved quantities cognizes nonlinear systems.
Conserved quantities are not unique, since one can always add a constant to a conserved quantity.
Since most laws of physics express some kind of conservation, conserved quantities commonly exist in mathematical models of real systems. For example, any classical mechanics model will have energy as a conserved quantity so long as the forces involved are conservative.
