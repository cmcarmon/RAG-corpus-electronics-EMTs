A number of phenomena are related to the interaction of mechanical energy with electrical energy. The ﬁeld
acoustics
 deals with those situations where that mechanical energy takes the form of sound waves. Acoustic
of 
applications have been particularly fruitful, especially during the last two decades. Surface acoustic wave (SAW)
ﬁlters  are  among  the  more  useful  applications.  These  elegant  devices  are  a  marriage  of  sophisticated  signal
theory  and  piezoelectricity,  consummated  on  the  bed  of  thin-ﬁlm  technology.  Unlike  some  elegant  devices,
they have been commercially successful as well.
