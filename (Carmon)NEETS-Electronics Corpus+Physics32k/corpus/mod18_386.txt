The combination of stc and iagc circuits results in better overall performance than with either type of
gain control alone. Stc decreases the amplitude of nearby target return signals, while iagc decreases the
amplitude of larger-than-average return signals. Thus, normal changes of signal amplitudes are adequately
compensated for by the combination of iagc and stc.
