Sailplanes, hang gliders and paragliders are all types of glider aircraft.
For a glider to generate lift, it must first gain and then maintain sufficient forward air speed.
Launching a glider gives it the initial forward airspeed to start flying. This is often done by towing the aircraft into the air on a long line, using either a ground-based winch or vehicle, or a powered "tug" aircraft. A small foot-launched glider is launched by running downhill or stepping off a high location.
Forward speed is then maintained by a gradual descent through the surrounding air, with the wings angled slightly down so that their lift also provides a small forward thrust to counter the drag of the wing.
If the air is rising faster than the aircraft is descending through it, the glider will gain height and additional potential energy. Sources of such rising air include warm thermals and hill ridges.
In the past, unpowered military gliders have been used for military applications.
Today, the majority of use of all types of glider aircraft is recreational.
