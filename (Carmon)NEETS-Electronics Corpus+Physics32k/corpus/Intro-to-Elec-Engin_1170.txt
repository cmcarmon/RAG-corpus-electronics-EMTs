Equations (13.3.9) and (13.3.10) hold for a cylindrical-rotor synchronous generator with negligible
armature resistance. To obtain the total power for a three-phase generator, Equations (13.3.9) and
(13.3.10) should be multiplied by 3 when the voltages are line to neutral. If the line-to-line
magnitudes are used for the voltages, however, these equations give the total three-phase power.
The power-angle or torque-angle characteristic of a cylindrical-rotor synchronous machine
is shown in Figure 13.3.3, neglecting the effect of armature resistance. The maximum real power
output per phase of the generator for a given terminal voltage and a given excitation voltage is
