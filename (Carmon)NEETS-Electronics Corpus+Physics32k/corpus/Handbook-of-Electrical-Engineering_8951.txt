Joystick
The  joystick  has  not  achieved  much  acceptance  as  an  input  device  for  electronic  display  systems,  except  for
video games, although it has been the preferred control for many types of aircraft. However, it can be used to
some extent in display systems other than those used in video games, and therefore warrants inclusion in this
section. There are two basic types of joysticks, termed “displacement” and “force-operated”. A typical displace-
ment joystick is shown in Fig. 89.10, and may have two or three degrees of freedom. The activating means may
vary  from  as  few  as  four  switches  mounted  90  degrees  apart,  to  full  potentiometers  for  analog  output,  and
optical encoders for digital output. A third axis may be added by allowing the handle to rotate and drive a third
potentiometer. Spring forces of 5 to 10 lbs. are usual for the other two axes, and displacements go from 6 to
30 degrees.
