The collision destroyed both Iridium 33 (owned by Iridium Communications Inc.) and Cosmos 2251 (owned by the Russian Space Forces). The Iridium satellite was operational at the time of the collision. Cosmos-2251 was launched on June 16, 1993, and went out of service two years later, in 1995, according to Gen. Yakushin. It had no propulsion system, and was no longer actively controlled.
Several smaller collisions had occurred previously, during rendezvous attempts or the intentional destruction of a satellite, including the DART satellite colliding with MUBLCOM, and three collisions involving the manned Mir space station, during docking attempts by Progress M-24, Progress M-34, and Soyuz TM-17, but these were all low-velocity collisions. In 1996, the Cerise satellite collided with space debris. There have been eight known high-speed collisions in all, most of which were only noticed long after they occurred.
