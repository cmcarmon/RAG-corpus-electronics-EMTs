While most research attention has been focused on fault de-
tection and diagnosis, much less research effort has been
dedicated to ‘‘general’’ failure accommodation mainly because
of the lack of well-developed control theory and techniques for
general nonlinear systems. Because of the inherent complexity
of nonlinear systems, most of model-based analytical redun-
dancy fault diagnosis and accommodation studies deal with
the linear system that is subject to simple additive or multi-
plicative faults. This assumption has limited the system’s
effectiveness and usefulness in practical applications. In this
research work, the online fault accommodation control prob-
lems under catastrophic system failures are investigated. The
main interest is dealing with the unanticipated system com-
ponent failures in the most general formulation. Through
discrete-time Lyapunov stability theory, the necessary and
sufﬁcient conditions to guarantee the system online stability
and performance under failures are derived, and a systematic
procedure and technique for proper fault accommodation
under the unanticipated failures are developed. The approach
is to combine the control technique derived from discrete-time
Lyapunov theory with the modern intelligent technique that is
capable of self-optimization and online adaptation for real-
