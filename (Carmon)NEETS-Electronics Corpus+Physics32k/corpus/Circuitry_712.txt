emitter  junction  is  still  intact  and  thus  the  normal 
forward  voltage  drop  of  0.6  V  is  present.  In  this 
condition a relatively high value of current is drawn 
by  the  stage  and  thus  the  supply  voltage  falls 
slightly. 
 
Fault 2
The  base-emitter  short-circuit  produces  identical 
base  and  emitter  voltages.  No  collector  current 
flows and the collector voltage rises to almost the  
full supply voltage. The base and emitter  voltages 
are  relatively 
the  emitter  resistor 
effectively  appears  in  parallel  with  the  lower 
section  of  the  base  bias  potential  divider,  thus 
pulling the base voltage down. 
 
Fault 3 
 
Identical voltages at the collector and emitter result 
from  a  collector-emitter  short-circuit.  The  emitter 
voltage rises above the base voltage and the base-
emitter  junction  is  well  and  truly  turned  off.  The 
short-circuit causes a higher value of current to be 
drawn  from  the  supply  and  hence  the  supply 
voltage falls slightly. 
 
Fault 4 
 
Perhaps the most obvious fault condition is when a 
short-circuit  condition  affects  all  three  terminals. 
The  voltages  are,  naturally,  identical  and,  as  with 
fault  3,  more  current  than  usual  is  taken  from  the 
supply  and,  as  a  consequence,  the  supply  voltage 
falls slightly. 
 
Fault 5 
 
With  the  base-emitter  junction  open-circuit,  the 
base-emitter  voltage  rises  well  above  the  0.6  V 
which would normally be expected. No collector or 
emitter  current  is  flowing  and  thus  the  collector 
voltage rises, while the emitter voltage falls.
