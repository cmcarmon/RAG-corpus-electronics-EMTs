As noted above, pyroelectric devices have also been used for thermal imaging. In this application, their main
advantage when compared with photon detector materials such as mercury cadmium telluride (CMT) (which
are  more  sensitive)  is  that  they  can  be  used  at  room  temperature. All  the  photon  detectors  require  cooling,
typically to 77 K. A very successful device for pyroelectric thermal imaging is the pyroelectric vidicon which
uses a thin plate of pyroelectric material contained in a vacuum tube. The thermal image is focused onto the
surface of the material using a germanium lens. This causes the formation of a pattern of pyroelectric charges,
which are “read” by means of an electron beam. Typical sensitivities for such devices are between 0.50 and 1 K
temperature differences in the scene for an f/1 lens. This compares with <0.10 K for a cooled CMT detector-
based imager. Recently, a solid-state approach to pyroelectric thermal imaging has been developed. In this,
m
m square, depending
an array of many thousands of very small identical detectors, each between 50 and 100 
on the array design, are linked to a silicon ampliﬁer/multiplexer circuit which allows the signals from all the
elements  to  be  read  onto  a  single  output  line.  These  devices  have  been  primarily  developed  for  thermal
imaging  applications  and  excellent  sensitivities  (close  to  those  achieved  by  many  cooled  systems)  have  been
demonstrated.
