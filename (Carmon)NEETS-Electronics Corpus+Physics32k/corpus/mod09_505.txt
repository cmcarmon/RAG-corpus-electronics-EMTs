The bistable multivibrator is also known as a FLIP-FLOP. The two inputs are SET and CLEAR. The 
two outputs are "1" and "0." A trigger pulse on the set input will cause the "1" output (negative or positive 
voltage depending on the type transistor used). At the same time the "0" output will equal 0 volts. This is 
the SET state.
