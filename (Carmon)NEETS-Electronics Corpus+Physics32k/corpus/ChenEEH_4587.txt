where a is the learning rate parameter. The searching procedure
is repeated until inequalities of equations 8.11 and 8.12 hold, the
control input converges, or the maximum number of iterations
is reached. Of course, the term nf ~yy(k þ 1), the remaining un-
certainty of the failure dynamics, and the remaining uncertainty
of the nominal system N~yy(k þ 1) are unknown; the terms
qnf ~yy(k þ 1)=qu(k) and qN ~yy(k þ 1)=qu(k) cannot be com-
puted either. So, the actual searching procedure is based on
the approximated values:
