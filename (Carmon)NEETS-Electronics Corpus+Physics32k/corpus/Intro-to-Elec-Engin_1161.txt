Applications for Induction Motors
Before specifying a particular motor for a given application, the designer must know the load
characteristics, such as horsepower requirement, starting torque, acceleration capability, speed
variation, duty cycle, and the environment in which the motor is to operate. Typical speed–torque
curves for squirrel-cage induction motors with NEMA design classiﬁcation A, B, C, and D are
shown in Figure 13.2.17. Having selected the appropriate motor for a given application, the next
step is to specify a controller for the motor to furnish proper starting, stopping, and reversing
without damaging the motor, other connected loads, or the power system. The ranges of standard
power ratings given by NEMA for single-phase motors are listed in Table 13.2.1. Two-phase
induction motors with high rotor resistance are employed as servomotors for control-system
applications that usually require positive damping over the full speed range.
