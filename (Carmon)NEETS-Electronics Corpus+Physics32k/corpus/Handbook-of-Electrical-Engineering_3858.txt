The  basic  three-element  Yagi–Uda  array  is  shown  in  Fig. 38.5.  The  array  consists  of  a  driven  antenna  of
length l1, a reﬂector element of length l2, and a director element of length l3. Typically, the director element is
shorter than the driven element by 5% or more, while the reﬂector element is longer than the driven element
by  5%  or  more  [Stutzman  and  Thiele,  1981].  The  radiation  pattern  for  the  array  in  Fig. 38.5  will  have  a
maximum in the +z direction.
