Some rotary switches are made with several layers or levels. The arrangement makes possible the
control of several circuits with a single switch. Figure 3-8 is an illustration of a rotary switch with two
layers. Each layer has a selector and 20 contacts. As this switch is rotated, both layers select a single
circuit (contact) of the 20.
