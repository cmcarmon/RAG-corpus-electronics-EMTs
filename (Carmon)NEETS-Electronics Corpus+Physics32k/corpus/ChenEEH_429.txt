Ladder Simulation
The analogy of the present treatment with the one summarized
in Figure 4.10 should let us suspect that ﬂoating inductors can
be simulated as well by appropriate gyrator connections.
Indeed, we only need to connect two gyrators with identical
gm values to a grounded capacitor as shown in Figure 4.18(B)
to obtain a ﬂoating inductor of value L ¼ C=g 2
m. For example,
