Note that ID is simply the DC bias current related to the DC input voltage VI.
Accordingly, the DC terms relating ID to VI can be equated as in Equation 8.9
because the operating point values ID, VI satisfy Equation 8.3, which is the
MOSFET equation. When the DC terms are eliminated from both sides of
Equation 8.8, the incremental relation shown in Equation 8.10 results.
