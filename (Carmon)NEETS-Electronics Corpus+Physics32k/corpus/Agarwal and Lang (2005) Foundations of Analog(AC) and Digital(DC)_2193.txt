Given that vS = 2 cos(ωt) (in volts), make a sketch of vO(t) through one complete cycle.
Be sure to label the dimensions of the voltage and time axes and identify characteristic
waveform shapes with suitable expressions. (Make reasonable assumptions based on
your lab experience.)

and kT/q = 25 mV.
For v1 in the range |v1| < 575 V, how should the value of R be chosen to keep the Op
Amp in the linear region? Make reasonable approximations.
