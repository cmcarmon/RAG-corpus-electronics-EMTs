This is a useful way to study the stability of a given flow bifurcation theory with the changes that occur in the structure of a given system, in the case of hydrodynamic stability this is a series of differential equations and their solutions. A bifurcation occurs when a small change in the parameters of the system causes a qualitative change in its behaviour, the parameter that is being changed in the case of hydrodynamic stability is the Reynolds number. It can be shown that the occurrence of bifurcations falls in line with the occurrence of instabilities.
