Another form of color display is provided by cholesteric crystals. The three main types of liquid crystals,
nematic, cholesteric, and smectic, are distinguished by the different types of molecular ordering they display.
In  the  cholesteric  crystal,  the  direction  of  molecular  alignment  rotates  in  each  successive  parallel  plane
(Fig. 83.15).  The  spatial  period  of  the  rotation,  p,  is  called  the  pitch,  and  Bragg  reï¬‚ections  occur  when  the
wavelength of incident light meets the condition
