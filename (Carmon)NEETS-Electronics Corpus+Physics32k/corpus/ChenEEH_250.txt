This limitation stems from today’s power devices’ technol-
ogy. Based on vertical power MOSFET technology, most of
today’s low-voltage power MOSFETs are available at a rating
of 30 V. Roughly, the total power loss of a power device can
be divided into three parts: conduction loss, gate drive loss,
and switching loss. Figure 1.11 shows the relationship be-
tween conduction loss, gate drive loss, and switching loss.
For this kind of low-voltage, high-current application, con-
duction loss contributes a large percentage of the total loss.
When only one IRL3803 is used, the MOSFET’s conduction
loss is 25 times the gate drive loss plus the switching loss. To
reduce conduction and total loss, more switches need to be
paralleled. This does not necessarily mean, however, that
more parallel switches equals lower total
loss. When ﬁve
IRL3803 are paralleled, the total loss is reduced to the min-
imum. After this point, adding more switches will not im-
prove efﬁciency. Figure 1.12 shows the number of parallel
