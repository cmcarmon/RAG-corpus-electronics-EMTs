If some of the branch voltages in a circuit are known, then it is possible that KVL
alone can be used to find other branch voltages in the circuit. For example, consider
the circuit in Figure 2.18 with v1 = 1 V and v3 = 3 V, as shown in Figure 2.19. Using
Equation 2.16, namely KVL for Loop 4, it can be seen that v6 = 2 V. This is all that
can be learned from KVL alone given the information in Figure 2.19. But, if we further
know that v2 = 2 V, for example, we can learn from KVL applied to the other loops
that v4 = âˆ’1 V and v5 = 1 V.
