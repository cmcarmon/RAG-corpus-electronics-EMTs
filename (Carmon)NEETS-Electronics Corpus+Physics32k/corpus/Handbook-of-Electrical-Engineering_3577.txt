Design entry deﬁnes a desired speciﬁcation. Synthesis reﬁnes the initial design speciﬁcation into a detailed
design  ready  for  implementation.  Veriﬁcation  checks  that  the  detailed  design  faithfully  realizes  the  desired
speciﬁcation. Physical design deﬁnes the implementation, i.e., the actual hardware. Finally, test checks that the
manufactured part is functionally and parametrically correct.
