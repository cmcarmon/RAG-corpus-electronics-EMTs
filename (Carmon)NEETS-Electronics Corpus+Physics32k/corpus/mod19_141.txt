Transformers are often used to STEP-UP voltage. You may find a low 
voltage across the primary and a much higher voltage across the secondary. Use 
extreme caution, especially when working around television and other crt high 
voltage transformers. They often step voltages up to, or in excess of, 30,000 volts.
