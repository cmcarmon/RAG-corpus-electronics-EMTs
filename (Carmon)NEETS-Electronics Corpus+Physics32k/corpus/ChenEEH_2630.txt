The superconducting class of passive components is fabri-
cated by using both low- and high-temperature superconduct-
ors, such as NbN and YBCO materials, that are able to reduce
the conductor loss to a negligible level. Therefore, extremely
high Q superconductive planar transmission lines and wave-
guides can be used to design various loss- and noise-sensible
passive microwave components that include ﬁlters, diplexers,
low-loss antenna feeders, delay lines, and phase shifters. In
particular, the extremely narrow band-pass ﬁlters and very
