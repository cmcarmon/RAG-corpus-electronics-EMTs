Since  ampliﬁcation,  ﬁltering,  and  digitization  determine  the  frequency  characteristics  of  the  EEG  and  the
source of potential artifacts, the acquisition parameters must be chosen with an understanding of their effects
on signal acquisition and subsequent analysis. Ampliﬁcation, for example, increases the amplitude range (volts)
of  the  analog-to-digital  (A/D)  converter.  The  resolution  of  the A/D  converter  is  determined  by  the  smallest
amplitude of steps that can be sampled. This is calculated by dividing the voltage range of the A/D converter
by 2 to the power of the number of bits of the A/D converter. For example, an A/D converter with a range of
–
2.4 mV. Appropriate matching of ampliﬁcation
and A/D converter sensitivity permits resolution of the smallest signal while preventing clipping of the largest
signal amplitudes.
