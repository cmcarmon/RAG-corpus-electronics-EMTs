{\displaystyle (.,.)\colon {\mathfrak {g}}\otimes {\mathfrak {g}}\to \mathbb {R} }
that is invariant under the adjoint action, i.e.
([X,Y],Z)+(Y,[X,Z])=0
where X,Y,Z are elements of the Lie algebra g. A localization/ generalization is the concept of Courant algebroid where the vector space g is replaced by (sections of) a vector bundle.
