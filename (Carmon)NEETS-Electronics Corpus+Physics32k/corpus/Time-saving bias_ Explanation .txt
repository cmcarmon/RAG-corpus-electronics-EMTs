The physical formula for calculating the time,



t


{\displaystyle t}
, gained when increasing speed is:




t
=
c
D
(

v

1


−
1


−

v

2


−
1


)


{\displaystyle t=cD(v_{1}^{-1}-v_{2}^{-1})}

where



c


{\displaystyle c}
is constant and used to transform between units of measurement,



t


{\displaystyle t}
is the time gained,



D


{\displaystyle D}
is the distance traveled and




v

1




{\displaystyle v_{1}}
and




v

2




{\displaystyle v_{2}}
are the original and increased speeds, respectively. This formula shows that the relationship between increasing speed and journey time is curvilinear: a similar speed increase would result in more time saved when increasing from a low speed compared to a higher speed. For example, when increasing from 20 to 30 mph the time required to complete 10 miles decreases from 30 to 20 minutes, saving 10 minutes. However, the same speed increase of 10 mph would result in less time saved if the initial speed is higher (e.g., only 2 minutes saved when increasing from 50 mph to 60 mph). Changing the distance of the journey from 10 miles to a longer or shorter distance will increase or decrease these time savings, but will not affect the relationship between speed and time savings.
Svenson (2008) suggested that people’s judgments of time-savings actually follow a Proportion heuristic, by which people judge the time saved as the proportion of the speed increase from the initial speed. Another study suggested that people might follow a simpler difference heuristic, by which they judge the time saved based solely on the difference between the initial and higher speed (Peer, 2010b, Study 3). It seems that people falsely believe that journey time decreases somewhat linearly as driving speed increases, irrespective of the initial speed, causing the time-saving bias. Although it is still unclear what is the dominant heuristic people use to estimate time savings, it is evident that almost none follow the above curvelinear relationship.
