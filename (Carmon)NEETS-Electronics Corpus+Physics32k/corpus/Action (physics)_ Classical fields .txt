The action principle can be extended to obtain the equations of motion for fields, such as the electromagnetic field or gravitational field.
The Einstein equation utilizes the Einsteinâ€“Hilbert action as constrained by a variational principle.
The trajectory (path in spacetime) of a body in a gravitational field can be found using the action principle. For a free falling body, this trajectory is a geodesic.
