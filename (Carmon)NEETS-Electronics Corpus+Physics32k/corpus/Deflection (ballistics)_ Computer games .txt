Modern computer games of the first-person shooter genre typically feature a number of relatively low-velocity projectile weapons such as unguided shoulder-launched missile weapons, such that leading targets is necessary. Additionally, in some multiplayer games that calculate behavior on a remote server, even for high-velocity or hitscan weapons, there are issues of latency that may require leading. Essentially, even if the shooter has the target exactly in his sights, by the time the information relating weapon fire from the shooter's computer has reached the server, the target may have moved enough to avoid the shot.
Modern game-engines use a lag compensation system which moves all players back to a point in time based on the shooter's client interpolation time and ping (or more commonly by trusting the result detected on the client side) to evaluate if there was a hit or not. Such systems eliminate the need to lead hitscan weapons, but introduce the risk of players being shot after visibly taking cover.
