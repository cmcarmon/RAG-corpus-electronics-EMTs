the output of which is obtained by transforming h[n] and s[n] into H[k] and S[k] via the DFT (FFT), multiplying
the transforms point-wise to obtain Y[k] = H[k]S[k], and then using the inverse DFT (FFT) to obtain y[n] =
IDFT{Y[k]}. If s[n] is a ﬁnite sequence of length M, then the result of the circular convolution implemented
by  the  DFT  will  correspond  to  the  desired  linear  convolution  if  and  only  if  the  block  length  of  the  DFT  is
chosen so that NDFT ‡ N + M – 1 and both h[n] and s[n] are padded with zeros to form blocks of length NDFT . 
Relationships among Fourier Transforms
Figure 14.8 illustrates the functional relationships among the various forms of CT and DT Fourier transforms
that have been discussed in the previous sections. The family of CT is shown on the left side of Fig. 14.8, whereas
the right side of the ﬁgure shows the hierarchy of DTFTs. Fourier transforms. The complex Fourier transform
is identical to the bilateral Laplace transform, and it is at this level that the classical Laplace transform techniques
and the Fourier transform techniques become identical.
