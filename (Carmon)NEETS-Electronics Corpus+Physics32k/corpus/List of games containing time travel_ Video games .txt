Time travel has been used and explored by both film, literature, and video games. Unlike films and literature, video games allow the player to interact directly, opening up different forms of gameplay. Time travel as a plot device has been employed in video games since early arcade games. The manipulation of time as an aspect of gameplay entered the mainstream following the release of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time in 2003, though earlier titles such as 2000's The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask have employed it.
