modeling 
The adaptability of the ﬁlter is necessary since H(z) changes appreciably with movement of people or objects
in the room and because periodic measurements of the room would be impractical. Acoustic echo cancellation
is more challenging than cancelling line echoes for several reasons. First, room impulse responses h(t) are longer
than 200 ms compared to less than 20 ms for line echo cancellers. Second, the echo path of a room h(t) is likely
to change constantly (note that even small changes in temperature can cause signiﬁcant changes of h). Third,
