The amount of light reflected back to the phototube is a measure of the lightness or darkness of the 
segment of the picture being scanned. The phototube changes the varying amounts of light into electrical 
signals. These are used to amplitude modulate the constant frequency output of a local oscillator. The 
modulated signal is then amplified and sent to the radio circuits.
