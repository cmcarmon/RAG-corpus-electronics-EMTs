Avogadro's law states that the volume occupied by an ideal gas is directly proportional to the number of molecules of the gas present in the container. This gives rise to the molar volume of a gas, which at STP (273.15 K, 1 atm) is about 22.4 L. The relation is given by

{\displaystyle {\frac {V_{1}}{n_{1}}}={\frac {V_{2}}{n_{2}}}\,}

where n is equal to the number of molecules of gas (or the number of moles of gas).
