When you are testing individual components in a circuit, a parallel resistor or diode of similar value
may cause a defective component to appear good. Therefore, you should, in most cases, electrically
isolate the suspected component from the circuit while testing individual components. The best way to do
this is to desolder all but one lead on the suspected component.
