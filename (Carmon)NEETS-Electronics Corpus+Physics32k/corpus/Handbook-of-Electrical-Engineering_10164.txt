Joint torque sensors, as the name implies, are placed at the joints of the manipulator. If F represent the vector
of forces at the end effector, then the corresponding vector of joint torques is obtained by using t =[J(q)]T F,
where J(q) is the Jacobian and q are the generalized joint coordinates. Joint torque sensing has some drawbacks.
First, to obtain the endpoint forces F, the Jacobian which changes with the conﬁguration has to be inverted in
real time. Second, the sensors at the joints not only measure the forces and torques applied at the hand but
also those applied at the other points of the manipulator. Wrist sensors are better at reducing this uncertainty
because they are placed close to the end effector and below the last powered joint of the manipulator. Several
wrist sensors are available commercially with necessary electronics to obtain force/torque measurements at high
speeds suitable for real-time force control. Another method for providing information about the gripping forces
is  by  mounting  tactile  sensors  at  the  ﬁngertips.  However,  these  may  not  be  suitable  in  situations  where  high
gripping forces are required. Force pedestals are employed when a common platform is used for many tasks. In
this case, the platform is instrumented to measure interacting forces and torques.
