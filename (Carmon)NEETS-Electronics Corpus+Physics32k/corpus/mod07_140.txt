When the ac input goes in a negative direction (fig. 1-21 view A), the top of the transformer becomes
negative and the diode becomes reverse biased. With reverse bias applied to the diode, the depletion
region increases, the resistance of the diode is high, and minimum current flows through the diode. For all
