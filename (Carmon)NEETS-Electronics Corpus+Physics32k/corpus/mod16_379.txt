An ordinary ohmmeter cannot be used for measuring multimillion ohm values of resistances, such as
those in conductor insulation. To test for such insulation breakdown, you need to use a much higher
potential than that supplied by the battery of an ohmmeter. This potential is placed between the conductor
and the outside of the insulation. A megger (megohmmeter) is used for these tests. The megger, shown in
figure 3-15, is a portable instrument consisting of two main elements: (1) a hand-driven dc generator,
which supplies the necessary voltage for making the measurement, and (2) the instrument portion, which
indicates the value of the resistance you are measuring. The instrument portion is of the opposed-coil
type, as shown in view A. Coils a and b are mounted on movable member c. A fixed angular relationship
exists between coils, and they are free to turn as a unit in a magnetic field. Coil b tends to move the
pointer counterclockwise, and coil a tends to move it clockwise.
