The supernova was at magnitude 16.4 at discovery, and quickly rose to a peak magnitude of around 15.3 (in visible light) just over a week after discovery. By mid-May, the supernova had faded to 17th magnitude.
The host galaxy, NGC 5698, along with the supernova lie approximately 200 million light-years (~60 million parsecs) from Earth. This puts the absolute magnitude of the supernova at around âˆ’18.6 at maximum, rather faint for a Type Ia event.
As the supernova was of Type Ia, its progenitor star was a White Dwarf star which exceeded the Chandrasekhar limit.
Below is an image of SN 2005bc and NGC 5698 taken just over a week after peak brightness.
