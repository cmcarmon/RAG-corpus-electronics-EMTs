An oscilloscope can be used to graphically display the back-and-forward resistance characteristics of
a crystal diode. A circuit used in conjunction with an oscilloscope to make this test is shown in figure 2-
15. This circuit uses the oscilloscope line-test voltage as the test signal. A series circuit (composed of
resistor R1 and the internal resistance in the line-test circuit) decreases a 3-volt, open-circuit test voltage
to a value of approximately 2 volts peak to peak.
