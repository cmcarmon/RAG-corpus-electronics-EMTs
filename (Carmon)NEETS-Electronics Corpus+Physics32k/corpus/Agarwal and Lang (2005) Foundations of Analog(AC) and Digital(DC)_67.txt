Electrical engineering and computer science, or electrical engineering for
short,
is one of many engineering disciplines. Electrical engineering is the
purposeful use of Maxwell’s Equations (or Abstractions) for electromagnetic
phenomena. To facilitate our use of electromagnetic phenomena, electrical
engineering creates a new abstraction layer on top of Maxwell’s Equations
called the lumped circuit abstraction. By treating the lumped circuit abstrac-
tion layer, this book provides the connection between physics and electrical
engineering. It unifies electrical engineering and computer science as the art
of creating and exploiting successive abstractions to manage the complexity of
building useful electrical systems. Computer systems are simply one type of
electrical system.
