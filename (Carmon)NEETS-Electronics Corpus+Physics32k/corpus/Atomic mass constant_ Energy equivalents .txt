The atomic mass constant can also be expressed as its energy equivalent, that is muc2. The 2010 CODATA recommended values are:
1.492417954(66)×10−10 J
931.494061(21) MeV
The megaelectronvolt (MeV) is commonly used as an unit of mass in particle physics, and these values are also important for the practical determination of relative atomic masses. Although relative atomic masses are defined for neutral atoms, they are measured (by mass spectrometry) for ions: hence, the measured values must be correct for the mass of the electrons that were removed to form the ions, and also for the mass equivalent of the electron binding energy, Eb/muc2. The total binding energy of the six electrons in a carbon-12 atom is 1030.1089 eV = 1.650 4163×10−16 J: Eb/muc2 = 1.105 8674×10−6, or about one part in 10 million of the mass of the atom.
