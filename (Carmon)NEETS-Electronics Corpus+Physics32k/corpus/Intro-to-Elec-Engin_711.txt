7.4.7 A self-biased n-channel JFET used in the circuit
of Example 7.4.1 has the characteristics given in
Figure P7.4.7 and a supply voltage VDD = 36

7.4.1, with the JFET having VP = 4 V and IDSS =
−5 mA, ﬁnd RD and RS to establish IDQ = −2
mA and VDSQ = −4 V when VDD = −12 V.
7.4.9 An n-channel JFET in the circuit conﬁguration
shown in Example 7.4.1 is operating at IDQ =
6 mA and VGSQ = −1 V when VDS = 5 V.

(b) RD = 4 k.
7.4.10 An n-channel JFET is given to have VP = 3 V
and IDSS = 6 mA.
(a) Find the smallest value of vDS when vGS = −2
V if the operation is to be in the active region.
(b) Determine the corresponding iD for the small-

is operating in the ohmic or active region when
vGS = −3.2 V and iD = 0.5 mA.
7.4.12 For an n-channel JFET with VA = 350 V, IDSS =
10 mA, and VP = 3 V, ﬁnd VDS that will cause
iD = 11 mA when vGS = 0.

V, and IDSS = 10 mA is to be operated in the
active mode. Determine iD when vDS = 10 V and
vGS = −0.5 V.
7.4.14 Sketch gm versus vGS for a JFET with IDSS = 10
mA, VP = 3 V, VA = 100 V, and vDS = 10 V. See
