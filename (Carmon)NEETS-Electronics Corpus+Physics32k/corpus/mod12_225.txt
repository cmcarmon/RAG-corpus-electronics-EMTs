extremely low-level modulator that is useful in portable equipment. In emitter-injection modulation, the 
gain of the rf amplifier is varied by the changing voltage on the emitter. The changing voltage is caused 
by the injection of the modulating signal into the emitter circuitry of Q1, as shown in figure 1-51. Here 
the modulating voltage adds to or subtracts from transistor biasing. The change in bias causes a change in 
collector current and results in a heterodyning action. The modulation envelope is developed across the 
collector-tank circuit.
