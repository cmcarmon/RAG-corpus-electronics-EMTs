The Massachusetts Body of Liberties was the first legal code established by European colonists in New England. Compiled by the Puritan minister Nathaniel Ward, the laws were established by the Massachusetts General Court in 1641. The Body of Liberties begins by establishing the exclusive right of the General Court to legislate and dictate the "Countenance of Authority".
In 1684 King Charles II revoked the Body of Liberties and reinstated English law over the Commonwealth. When King James II established the Massachusetts Colony the Body of Liberties took effect and remained so until it was replaced by the 1691 Provincial Charter.
