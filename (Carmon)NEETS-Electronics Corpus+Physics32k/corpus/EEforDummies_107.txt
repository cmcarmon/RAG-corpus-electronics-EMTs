Sensing and alarming
Electronics can be used also to make something happen in response to a spe-
cific level or absence of light, heat, sound, or motion. Electronic sensors gen-
erate or change an electrical current in response to a stimulus. Microphones, 
motion detectors, temperature sensors, humidity sensors, and light sensors 
can be used to trigger other electronic components to perform some action, 
such as activating an automatic door opener, sounding an alarm, or switching 
a sprinkler system on or off.
