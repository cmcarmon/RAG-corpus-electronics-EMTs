Introduction
In a typical signal processing application, one is given empirically gathered data that arises from measurements
made on a signal(s) characterizing a phenomenon under study. These measurements are invariably corrupted
due to imperfections arising from the measurement instrumentation and environmental inﬂuences. To recover
a reasonable facsimile of the original signal being monitored, it is generally necessary to process the measurement
data in a manner that takes into account all information known about the monitored signal, the instrument
dynamics, and the nature of the corruption. Although it is generally impossible to obtain a perfect recovery,
remarkable approximations can be made in several important applications by employing the concept of signal
restoration  (or  signal  recovery).  In  signal  restoration,  a  priori  knowledge  concerning  the  underlying  signal’s
intrinsic nature may be effectively used to strip away the corruption in the measurement data. The philosophy
behind this approach is to modify the measurement data to the smallest extent possible so that the modiﬁed
data possesses the prescribed properties known (or hypothesized) as being possessed by the underlying signal(s).
This modiﬁcation then serves as a cleansing process whereby the measurement corruption is effectively removed.
