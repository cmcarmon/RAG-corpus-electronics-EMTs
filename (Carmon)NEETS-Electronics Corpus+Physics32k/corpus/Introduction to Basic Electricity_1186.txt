Based  on  the  classification  of  the  hazardous 
 material, the DOT is responsible for determining the 
appropriate packaging materials for shipping or trans-
port. Packing	groups are used to indicate the degree 
of risk a hazardous material may pose when in trans-
port. Packing groups are always represented by roman 
numerals that indicate the type of packaging required 
for the hazardous materials as well as quantity limits 
allowed. The groups are shown below:
■● Packing Group I—High danger
■● Packing Group II—Moderate danger
■● Packing Group III—Low danger
Also, based on the material classification, there are 
strict guidelines for proper labeling or marking of 
packages with hazardous materials to be transported 
and for signs on the transport vehicles (Figure 9-4).
