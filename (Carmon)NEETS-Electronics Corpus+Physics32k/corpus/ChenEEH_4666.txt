Let us now move to the second method described in this
chapter and give the theoretical development prior to present-
ing application results for both methods. As an extension to
the works described in the previous sections, in this section we
describe an adaptive DSMC design method for nonlinear
systems having an input/output form. Explicit knowledge of
the system dynamics is not required; instead, feed-forward
neural networks are applied to approximate the unknown
part of the system dynamics based on past system outputs
and control inputs. The sliding surface, deÔ¨Åned in terms of a
stable polynomial of the system tracking error, is used to tune
the neural network structure online using gradient methods.
The sliding-mode control law is given based on the approxi-
mated system dynamics. It can be proved that the state trajec-
tories will converge to a small sliding sector whose size could
be as small as desired provided that the structure of the neural
networks is large enough.
