Inductance Simulation
In  the  inductance  simulation  approach,  use  is  made  of  impedance  converter/inverter  networks.  Figure  29.8
gives a classiﬁcation of the various generic forms of device. The NIC enjoyed prominence in the early days of
active ﬁlters but was found to be prone to instability. Two classes of device that have proved more useful in the
longer term are the GIC and the gyrator.
