Since Dutch roll is a handling mode, analogous to the short period pitch oscillation, any effect it might have on the trajectory may be ignored. The body rate r is made up of the rate of change of sideslip angle and the rate of turn. Taking the latter as zero, assuming no effect on the trajectory, for the limited purpose of studying the Dutch roll:

{\displaystyle {\frac {d\beta }{dt}}=-r}


The yaw and roll equations, with the stability derivatives become:

The inertial moment due to the roll acceleration is considered small compared with the aerodynamic terms, so the equations become:

The equation for roll rate is identical. But the roll angle,

{\displaystyle \phi }
(phi) is given by:

{\displaystyle {\frac {d\phi }{dt}}=p}


If p is a damped simple harmonic motion, so is



ϕ


{\displaystyle \phi }
, but the roll must be in quadrature with the roll rate, and hence also with the sideslip. The motion consists of oscillations in roll and yaw, with the roll motion lagging 90 degrees behind the yaw. The wing tips trace out elliptical paths.
Stability requires the "stiffness" and "damping" terms to be positive. These are:

(stiffness)

The denominator is dominated by




L

p




{\displaystyle L_{p}}
, the roll damping derivative, which is always negative, so the denominators of these two expressions will be positive.
Considering the "stiffness" term:



−

L

p



N

β




{\displaystyle -L_{p}N_{\beta }}
will be positive because




L

p




{\displaystyle L_{p}}
is always negative and




N

{\displaystyle N_{\beta }}
is positive by design.




L

β




{\displaystyle L_{\beta }}
is usually negative, whilst




N

p




{\displaystyle N_{p}}
is positive. Excessive dihedral can destabilize the Dutch roll, so configurations with highly swept wings require anhedral to offset the wing sweep contribution to




L

β




{\displaystyle L_{\beta }}
.
The damping term is dominated by the product of the roll damping and the yaw damping derivatives, these are both negative, so their product is positive. The Dutch roll should therefore be damped.
The motion is accompanied by slight lateral motion of the center of gravity and a more "exact" analysis will introduce terms in




Y

β




{\displaystyle Y_{\beta }}
etc. In view of the accuracy with which stability derivatives can be calculated, this is an unnecessary pedantry, which serves to obscure the relationship between aircraft geometry and handling, which is the fundamental objective of this article.
