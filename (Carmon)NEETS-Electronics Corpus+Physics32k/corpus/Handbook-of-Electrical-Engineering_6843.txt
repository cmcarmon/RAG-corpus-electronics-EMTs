problems, in which the two signals s (0) and s (1) correspond to the waveforms received after transmission of a
logical “zero’’ and “one,’’ respectively. In such problems, we are generally interested in minimizing the average
probability of error, which is the average of the two error probabilities weighted by the prior probabilities of
occurrence  of  the  two  signals.  This  is  a  Bayesian  performance  criterion,  and  the  optimum  decision  rule  is  a
straightforward extension of the correlation detector based on (73.5). In particular, under the assumptions that
the two signals are equally likely to occur prior to measurement, and that the noise is white and Gaussian, the
optimum decision between (73.16) and (73.17) is to choose the model (73.16) if (

More generally, many problems in digital communications involve deciding among M equally likely signals
with  M  >  2.  In  this  case,  again  assuming  white  Gaussian  noise,  the  decision  rule  that  minimizes  the  error
probability is to choose the signal  s 1
