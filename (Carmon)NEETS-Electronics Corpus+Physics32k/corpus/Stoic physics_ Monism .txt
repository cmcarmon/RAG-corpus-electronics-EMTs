As to the relation between the active and the passive principles there was no real difference. The active cause was always a corporeal current, and therefore matter, although the finest and subtlest matter. Aristotle's technical term Form (ethos) the Stoics never used, but always Reason or God. The Stoics laid down with rigid accuracy the two chief properties of matter â€“ extension in three dimensions, and resistance, both being traced back to force. There were, it is true, certain conceptions, creations of thought to which nothing real and external corresponded, such as time, space, and void, but though each of these might be said to be something, they could not be said to exist.
A Stoic might maintain that World-Soul, Providence, Destiny and Seminal Reason are not mere synonyms, for they express different aspects of God or different relations of God to things, but there were no different substances underlying the different forces of nature. The pneuma neither increases nor diminishes; but its modes of working, its different currents, can be conveniently distinguished and enumerated as evidence of so many distinct attributes.
