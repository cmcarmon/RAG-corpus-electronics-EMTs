The grounding wire used for this purpose is generally made of flexible material (copper or
aluminum) that provides sufficient current-carrying capacity to ensure an effective ground. In this
manner, equipment cases and frames that are not intended to be above ground potential are effectively
grounded; also, the possibility of electrical shock to personnel coming in contact with metal parts of the
equipment is minimized. The secondary purpose of grounding equipment is to improve the operation and
continuity of service of all equipments.
