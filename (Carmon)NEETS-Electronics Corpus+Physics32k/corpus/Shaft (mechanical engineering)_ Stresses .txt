The following stresses are induced in the shafts.
Shear stresses due to the transmission of torque (due to torsional load).
Bending stresses (tensile or compressive) due to the forces acting upon the machine elements like gears and pulleys as well as the self weight of the shaft.
Stresses due to combined torsional and bending loads.
