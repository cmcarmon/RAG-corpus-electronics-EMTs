from NaturePkg as a function of the temperature Temp, which,
in turn, is one of the thermal branch quantities. The second one,
Power, is calculated from the electrical branch quantities V and
ID in the last equation. Note the noncausal notation of these
equations. The diode current ID thus depends on the junction
temperature via the thermal voltage VT.
