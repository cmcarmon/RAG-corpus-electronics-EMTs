In equations 8.29 and 8.30, k0 is the current time-step, pfi,
and ny represent the time domain signatures of the postfailure
model i and the nominal model, respectively. Equation 8.29
will examine the system’s state every vf time-steps. In cases of
failure alarms caused by unexpected disturbances or measure-
ment noises, the detection scheme will eventually recognize the
false alarm situations by comparing the signatures of the actual
system behavior with the nominal system using a prespeciﬁed
threshold value and recommend nominal control actions to
avoid the unnecessary control effort after the effect resulting
from unexpected disturbances or noises decay. Sharing the
spirit of the multiple model approach, the effective control
actions to achieve successful
failure accommodations for
anticipated faults are selected based on the matching condi-
tions of the signatures between the actual failures and the
multiple model-based failures. The fault isolation process is
to compare the most recent time domain signatures between
the actual failure and the postfailures. The differences be-
tween the actual measurements and the outputs of the nominal
model are considered as the outputs from the failure dynamics,
and they are compared with the ‘‘signatures,’’ outputs, from
the postfailure models within a certain length of time-shifting
window, vf diag. A prespeciﬁed threshold value is used to
compare with cf diagi
for the proper selection of the anti-
cipated failure condition. If none of the ‘‘signatures’’ of the
anticipated failures meets the criterion, the system status will
be switched to the unanticipated failure situation, and the
