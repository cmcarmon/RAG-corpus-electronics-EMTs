Thevenin theorem for ac circuits: A phasor circuit across a
pair of terminals is equivalent to an ideal phasor voltage source
Voc in series with an impedance ZTh, where Voc is the open
circuit voltage across the terminals and where ZTh is the
equivalent impedance of the circuit across the speciÔ¨Åed ter-
minals.
