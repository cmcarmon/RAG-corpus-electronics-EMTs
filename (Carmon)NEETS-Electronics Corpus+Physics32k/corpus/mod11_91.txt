The operation of a velocity-modulated tube depends on a change in the velocity of the electrons 
passing through its electrostatic field. A change in electron velocity causes the tube to produce 
BUNCHES of electrons. These bunches are separated by spaces in which there are relatively few 
electrons. Velocity modulation is then defined as that variation in the velocity of a beam of electrons 
caused by the alternate speeding up and slowing down of the electrons in the beam. This variation is 
usually caused by a voltage signal applied between the grids through which the beam must pass.
