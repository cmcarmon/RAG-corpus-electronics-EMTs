In addition to his work in railroads, Sprague’s
diverse talents led to his development of electric
elevators, an ac induction smelting furnace, min-
iature electric power units for use in small appli-
ances, and as a member of the U.S. Naval Consulting Board during World War I, he developed fuses and
air  and  depth  bombs.  Sprague  was  awarded  the AIEE’s  Edison  Medal  in  1910.  (Courtesy  of  the  IEEE
