Cleaning, like all other parts of the process, should be considered during the design phase. Cleaning require-
ments are determined largely by the ﬂux in the solder paste, and should be determined before production is
ever started. Design issues may effect the choice of ﬂux, which determines cleaning. For example, low clearance
(close to the substrate) parts are difﬁcult to clean under, and the use of no-clean ﬂux may be suggested.
