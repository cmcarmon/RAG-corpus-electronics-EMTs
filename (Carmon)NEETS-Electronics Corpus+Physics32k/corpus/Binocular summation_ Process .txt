It is still uncertain exactly how this process is performed by the brain and remains an active area of research. The mechanism can be explained by some combination of probability summation, neural summation, and effects due to binocular-monocular differences in pupil size, accommodation, fixation, and rivalry. Probability summation comes from the principle that there is a greater chance of detecting a visual stimulus with two eyes than with one eye.
There are five possible results when the input stimuli are summed together. These are
Binocular facilitation. The summation is more than twice that of a single input.
Complete binocular summation. The summation is exactly twice that of a single input.
Partial binocular summation. The summation is greater than that of a single input, but less than twice as large.
No binocular summation. The summation is the same as a single input.
Binocular inhibition. The summation is lower than worse than a single input.
