The rapid advancement of the electronics industry has created a time when many products become obsolete
in  less  than  ﬁve  years’  time.  Electronic  products  must  be  built  to  last,  but  only  until  it  is  time  to  take  them
apart  for  rebuilding  or  for  reuse  of  material.  This  means  employing  modular  design  strategies  to  facilitate
disassembly for recycle or upgrade of the product rather than replacement. Designers must extend their views
to consider the full utilization of materials and the environmental impact of the material life cycle as well as
the product life cycle.
