I/O  intensive  applications  vary  widely  in  the  demand  they  place  on  the  I/O  system.  They  run  the  gamut
from processing small numbers of bulk I/Os that must be handled with minimum delay (supercomputer I/O)
to  large  numbers  of  simple  tasks  that  touch  small  amounts  of  data  (transaction  processing).  An  important
design challenge is to develop an I/O system that can handle the performance needs of these diverse workloads.
A given workload’s demand for I/O service can be speciﬁed in terms of three metrics: throughput, latency,
and bandwidth. Throughput refers to the number of requests for service made per unit time. Latency measures
how  long  it  takes  to  service  an  individual  request.  Bandwidth  gauges  the  amount  of  data  ﬂowing  between
service requesters (i.e., applications) and service providers (i.e., devices).
