The parallel-encoding or ﬂash ADC design provides the fastest operation at the expense of
high component count and high cost (ﬁgure 8.5).
The resistor network sets discrete thresholds for a number of comparators. All comparators
with thresholds above the input signal go false while those below go true. Then digital
encoding logic converts the result to a digital number.
