The  graphical  modeling  environments  cannot  be  viewed  as  replacements  for  the  matrix  environments
described  in  the  previous  sections,  as  most  of  the  block-diagram  environments  have  very  limited  analytical
capabilities  (usually  only  simulation  and  linearization).  However,  many  of  todayâ€™s  block  diagram  tools  have
been developed as companion packages by the same commercial vendors that also sell matrix environments.
Through linearization, it thus becomes possible to transform a non-linear block diagram to a linear represen-
tation which can then be analyzed and used for design in the matrix environment. Unfortunately, such automatic
transformations are only available between tools from the same vendor, cross-translations between arbitrary
tools are not possible.
