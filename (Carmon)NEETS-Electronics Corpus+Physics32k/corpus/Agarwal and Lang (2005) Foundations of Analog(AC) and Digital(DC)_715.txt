F I G U R E 5.8 A mapping
between voltage levels and logical
signals that provides noise
margins. For a logical high, senders
must output values in the VOH to
5-V range. For a logical low,
senders must output values in the
0 V to VOL range. Receivers must
correspondingly interpret values
greater than VIH as a logical high,
and output values lower than VIL as
a logical low.
