In the previous four chapters we've looked at communications equipment and systems that were used 
in several frequency ranges. Some have had many applications. In this chapter you will look at systems 
used in some portions of the rf spectrum that have not been covered in detail. We will also discuss the 
naval tactical data system (NTDS), which operates in the high-frequency and ultrahigh-frequency regions. 
Various portable communications equipments used in the military and an introduction to the laser and its 
uses in communications are included. Some of the applications presented are fairly new to the military 
community.
