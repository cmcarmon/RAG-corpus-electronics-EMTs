Level 11 provides a means of attaching user processes inter-
changeably to pipes, Ô¨Åles, or I/O devices. The idea is to make
each fundamental operation of levels 8, 9, and 10 (open, close,
read, and write) look the same so that the author of a program
need not be concerned with the differences in these objects.
