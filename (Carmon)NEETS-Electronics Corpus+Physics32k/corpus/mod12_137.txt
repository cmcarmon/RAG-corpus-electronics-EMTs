The impedance of a microphone is important in that it must be matched to the microphone cable and 
to the amplifier input as well as to the amplifier input load. Exact impedance matching is not always 
possible, especially in the case where the impedance of the microphone increases with an increase in 
frequency. A long microphone cable tends to seriously attenuate the high frequencies if the microphone 
impedance is high. This attenuation is caused by the increased capacitive action of the line at higher 
frequencies. If the microphone has a low impedance, a lower voltage is developed in the microphone, and 
more voltage is available at the load. Because many microphone lines used aboard ship are long, low-
impedance microphones must be used to preserve a sufficiently high voltage level- over the required 
frequency range.
