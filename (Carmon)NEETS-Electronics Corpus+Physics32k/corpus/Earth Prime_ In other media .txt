In the DC animated feature Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths, the villainous Owlman's ultimate goal is to locate a universe that he designates as Earth Prime, the so-called "original" universe that all other universes stem from, and destroy it, thus leading to the destruction of all reality as well, due to believing that the existence of a multiverse meant nothing truly matters. Earth Prime is shown to be a desolate barren wasteland of a planet which has been ripped out of orbit, with ruins as far as the eye can see. It is unknown what exactly caused its desolation, though Owlman reasons that mankind was destroyed by itself.
In the final episode of Spider-Man: The Animated Series, after saving the multiverse from Spider-Carnage, an evil version of himself from an alternate Earth, Spider-Man briefly visits Earth Prime and meets his own creator, Stan Lee.
