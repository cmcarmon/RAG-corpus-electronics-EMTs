Several  types  of  aeroturbines  are  available.  They  can  have  horizontal  or  vertical  axes,  number  of  blades
ranging from one to several, mounted upwind or downwind, and Ô¨Åxed- or variable-pitch blades with full blade
control or tip control. Vertical-axis (Darrieus) turbines are not self-starting and require a starting mechanism.
Today,  horizontal-axis  turbines  with  two  or  more  blades  are  the  most  prevalent,  and  considerable  work  is
underway to develop advanced versions of these.
