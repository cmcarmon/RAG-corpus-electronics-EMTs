Research around this time looked more at the behavioral dimensions of channels, somewhat the result of Wroe Aldersonâ€™s earlier writings. The first attempts were made to improve the typical conceptual models of inter-firm relations towards the tail end of the 1970s. Major developments were undertaken by researchers such as Robicheaux. Also the first marketing channels textbook was created Malled in 1976. Research in this decade was very limited in that studies were considered unsuccessful if conflict and power were not present. Leading researchers to focus on the car industry and franchisor-franchisee relations were conflict and power are more likely.
