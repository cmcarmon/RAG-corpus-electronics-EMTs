We have shown that both the inverting and non-inverting Op Amp connections
have very low output resistance, that is, they approximate ideal voltage sources.
But in some circuit applications, we may want the Op Amp to look like a
current source, that is, we want a very high output resistance. It follows from
the discussion at the end of Section 15.4.1 that such a design can be realized by
a change in the topology of the output circuit.
