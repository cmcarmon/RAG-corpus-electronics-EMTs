To examine the behavior of the circuit shown in Figure 12.6, we can
employ the node analysis method outlined in Chapter 3. Since a ground node
is already selected in Figure 12.6, and since the unknown voltage at the other
node is already labeled with the node voltage v, Steps 1 and 2 of the node
analysis are already complete. Note that v will be the primary unknown for the
node analysis.
