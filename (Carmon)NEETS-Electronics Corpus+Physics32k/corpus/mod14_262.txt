Now let’s compare a NAND gate to an AND gate with an inverter on each input. Figure 2-18 shows
these gates and the associated Truth Tables. With the NAND gate (view A), the output is HIGH when
either or both inputs is/are LOW. The AND gate with inverters on each input (view B), produces a HIGH
output only when both inputs are LOW. This comparison also points out the differences between the
expressions f = A B  (A AND B quantity NOT) and f = ¾fi¾ A  B  (NOT A AND NOT B).
