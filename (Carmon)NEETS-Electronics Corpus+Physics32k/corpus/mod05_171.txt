To check the direction of rotation of this armature, you should use the right-hand rule for motors. 
Hold your thumb, forefinger, and middle finger at right angles. Point your forefinger in the direction of 
field flux; in this case, from left to right. Now turn your wrist so that your middle finger points in the 
direction that the current flows in the winding on the outside of the ring. Note that current flows into the 
page (away from you) in the left-hand windings and out of the page (toward you) in the right-hand 
windings. Your thumb now points in the direction that the winding will move.
