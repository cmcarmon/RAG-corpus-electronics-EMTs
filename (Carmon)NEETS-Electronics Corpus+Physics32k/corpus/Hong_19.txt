For DC signals, the linearity of the system implies that H is independent of Vin. 
For  dynamic  signals,  the  transfer  function  cannot  in  general  be  described  simply. 
However,  if  the  input  is  a  sinusoidal  signal  then  the  output  must  also  be  a  sinusoidal 
signal  with  the  same  frequency  but  possibly  a  different  amplitude  and  phase.  In  other 
words,  a  linear  system  can  only  modify  the  amplitude  and  phase  of  a  sinusoidal 
input. As a result, if the input signal is described as a complex exponential,
