In speaking of a three-phase system, unless otherwise speciﬁed, balanced conditions are
assumed. The terms voltage, current, and power, unless otherwise identiﬁed, are conventionally
understood to imply the line-to-line voltage (rms value), the line current (rms value), and the total
power of all three phases. In general, the ratio of the real or average power P to the apparent
power or the magnitude of the complex power S is the power factor, which happens to be cos φ
in the sinusoidal case.
