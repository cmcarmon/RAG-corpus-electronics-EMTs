between two entities. Many functions are also deﬁned that help
in organizing data and arranging relations between different
objects in the video. Tran et al. (2000) proposed a graphical
model, VideoGraph that supports not only the event descrip-
tion but also the interevent description that describes the
temporal relationship between two events—a functionality
overlooked by most of the existing video data models. Tran
et al. (2000) also have a provision for exploiting incomplete
information by associating the temporal event with a Boolean-
like expression. A query language based on their framework is
proposed in which query processing involves only simple
graph traversal routines.
