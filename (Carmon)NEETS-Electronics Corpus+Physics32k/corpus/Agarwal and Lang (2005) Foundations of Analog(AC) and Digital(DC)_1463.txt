It is interesting to speculate as to what will happen if the switch in
Figure 10.32c is opened after being closed for a long time. When the switch is
opened, the inductor current cannot go to zero instantaneously. Since a prac-
tical open switch behaves as an extremely high resistance, the current through
the inductor will result in a huge voltage spike across the switch, and possibly
damage it.
