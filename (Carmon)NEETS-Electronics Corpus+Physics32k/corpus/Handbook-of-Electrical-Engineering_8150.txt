The Cathode
The  cathode  used  on  most  CRTs  is  the  oxide  cathode,  which  consists  typically  of  a  heated  nickel  substrate
coated with barium, strontium, and calcium oxides. This cathode works at a temperature of »800(cid:176)C and provides
a dc emission density up to 0.2 amp/cm2 and 2 amp/cm2 peak current density. When higher current densities
are  required,  a  tungsten-impregnated  cathode  (porous  tungsten  matrix  heated  at »1000(cid:176)C  and  impregnated
with barium and calcium aluminates) can be used. The impregnated cathode operates at higher temperature
than the oxide cathode and requires sophisticated materials and techniques for its processing. The impregnated
cathode, also known as a dispenser cathode, is commonly used on projection tubes and on other tubes where
high beam currents are required, typically above 1.5 mA.
