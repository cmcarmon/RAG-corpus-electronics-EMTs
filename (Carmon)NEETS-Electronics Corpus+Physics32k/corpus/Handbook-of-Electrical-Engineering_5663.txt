Normal  ratings  of  bulk-power-system  transformers  are  determined  by  manufacturersâ€™  nameplate  ratings.
Nameplate  ratings  are  based  on  the  following  ANSI/IEEE  standard  conditions:  (1) continuous  loading  at
nameplate output; (2) 30(cid:176)C average ambient temperature (never exceeding 40(cid:176)C); and (3) 110(cid:176)C average hot-
spot conductor temperature (never exceeding 120(cid:176)C) for 65(cid:176)C-average-winding-rise transformers [ANSI/IEEE
C57.92-1981, 1990]. For 55(cid:176)C-average-winding-rise transformers, the hot-spot temperature limit is 95(cid:176)C aver-
age (never exceeding 105(cid:176)C). The actual output that a bulk-power-system transformer can deliver at any time
with  normal  life  expectancy  may  be  more  or  less  than  the  nameplate  rating,  depending  on  the  ambient
temperature and actual temperature rise of the windings. Emergency transformer ratings typically vary from
130 to 150% of nameplate ratings.
