The use of integrated circuits enables designers to produce equipment that is very small and highly
efficient when compared to other methods of construction. The block diagram shown in figure 3-36, view
A, represents an 8-bit, serial-input and parallel-output shift register. This circuit is contained in a standard
14-pin DIP measuring about 0.75 inch long and 0.25 inch wide. View B shows this circuit package.
