There is also an important energy interpretation to Figure 12.7. It is that
the oscillations in iL and vC carry out a repetitive exchange of energy between
the inductor and the capacitor. Indeed, the state of each element drives the
growth of the other at the expense of the energy it stores. To see this, consider
the energy wE stored in the capacitor, the energy wM stored in the inductor, and
the total energy wT stored between them. In the general case, the substitution
of Equations 12.21 and 12.22 into Equations 9.18 and 9.36, respectively, yields
