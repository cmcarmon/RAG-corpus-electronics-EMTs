After completing this chapter, the student will be 
able to:
Describe the phase relationship between current 
and voltage in an inductive AC circuit.
Determine the inductive reactance in an AC 
circuit.
Explain impedance and its effect on inductive 
circuits.
Describe how an inductor-resistor network can 
be used for filtering and phase shifting.
Explain how low-pass and high-pass inductive 
circuits operate.
