i s t i c s o f a c i r c u i t Determine the i v relationship for the two-terminal
device shown in Figure 2.61a. Make a sketch of the i v relationship for R = 4  and
V = 5 V. As shown in the figure, assume that the internals of the device can be modeled
as a voltage source in series with a resistor.
