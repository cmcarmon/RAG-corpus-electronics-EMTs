philosophy is due, in part, to the fact that for any photovoltaic material, optimizing the light-generated current
is, in general, an easier task to accomplish than optimizing the voltage-sensitive parameters. Therefore, a better
measure of the potential performance of a material or design is the actual achieved open-circuit voltage, relative
to the theoretical open-circuit voltage, rather than short-circuit current, which often has a value approaching
the theoretically expected current.
