The electronics principle on which radar operates is very similar to the principle of sound-wave
reflection. If you shout in the direction of a sound-reflecting object (like a rocky canyon or cave), you will
hear an echo. If you know the speed of sound in air, you can then estimate the distance and general
direction of the object. The time required for a return echo can be roughly converted to distance if the
speed of sound is known. Radar uses electromagnetic energy pulses in much the same way, as shown in
figure 1-1. The radio-frequency (rf) energy is transmitted to and reflects from the reflecting object. A
small portion of the energy is reflected and returns to the radar set. This returned energy is called an
ECHO, just as it is in sound terminology. Radar sets use the echo to determine the direction and distance
of the reflecting object.
