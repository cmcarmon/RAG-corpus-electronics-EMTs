Other insulating materials ﬁnd use in small-scale applications. For instance, the small-
diameter wire used to make electromagnets (coils producing a magnetic ﬁeld from the ﬂow of
electrons) are often insulated with a thin layer of enamel. The enamel is an excellent insulating
material and is very thin, allowing many ”turns” of wire to be wound in a small space.
