At 180 degrees the voltage has dropped to zero. This means that for a brief instant the electrons are 
equally distributed between the two plates; the current is maximum because the rate of change of voltage 
is maximum. Just after 180 degrees the voltage has reversed polarity and starts building up its maximum 
negative peak which is reached at the end of the third quarter-cycle (180ยบ  to 270ยบ). During this third 
quarter-cycle the rate of voltage change gradually decreases as the charge builds to a maximum at 270 
degrees. At this point the capacitor is fully charged and it carries the full impressed voltage. Because the 
capacitor is fully charged there is no further exchange of electrons; therefore, the current flow is zero at 
this point. The conditions are exactly the same as at the end of the first quarter-cycle (90ยบ) but the polarity 
is reversed.
