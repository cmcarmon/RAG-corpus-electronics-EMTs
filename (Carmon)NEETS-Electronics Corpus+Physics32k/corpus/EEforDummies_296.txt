When you start shopping for resistors, you’ll find that you can’t always get 
exactly what you want. It would be impractical for manufacturers to make 
resistors with every possible value of resistance. Instead, they make resis­
tors with a limited set of resistance values, and you work around it (as you’re 
about to see). For instance, you can search far and wide for a 25 kΩ resistor, 
but you may never find it; however, 22 kΩ resistors are as common as the 
day is long! The trick is to figure out how to get the resistance you need using 
standard available parts.
