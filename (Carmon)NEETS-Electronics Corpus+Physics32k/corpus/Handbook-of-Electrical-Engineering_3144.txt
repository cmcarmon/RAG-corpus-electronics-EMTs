where Em is the peak value of the phase voltage. At a = 90(cid:176), the output voltage is zero. For 0 < a < 90(cid:176), vo is
positive  and  power  ï¬‚ows  from  ac  supply  to  the  load.  For  90(cid:176)  <  a  <  180(cid:176),  vo  is  negative  and  the  converter
operates in the inversion mode. If the load is a dc motor, the power can be transferred from the motor to the
ac supply, a process known as regeneration.
