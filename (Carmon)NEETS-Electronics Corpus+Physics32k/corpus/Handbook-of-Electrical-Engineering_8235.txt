The path the data travels through the system is called the data acquisition channel. Data are Ô¨Årst captured
and subsequently translated into usable signals using transducers. In this discussion, usable signals are assumed
to be electrical voltages, either unipolar (that is, single ended, with a common ground so that we need just one
lead wire to carry the signal) or bipolar (that is, common mode, with the signal carried by a wire pair, so that
the reference of the rest of the system is not part of the output). These voltages can be either analog or digital,
depending on the nature of the measurand (the quantity being captured). When there is more than one analog
 (MUX). Both the analog and the digital signals are
input, they are subsequently sent to an analog 
then conditioned using signal conditioners. There are two additional steps for those conditioned analog signals.
First they must be sampled (see Chapter 73.4) and next converted to digital data. This conversion is done by
analog-to-digital converters
