The defining criterion of a shock wave is that the bulk velocity of the plasma drops from "supersonic" to "subsonic", where the speed of sound cs is defined by




c

s

γ
p

/

ρ


{\displaystyle c_{s}^{2}=\gamma p/\rho }
where



γ


{\displaystyle \gamma }
is the ratio of specific heats, p is the pressure, and



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
is the density of the plasma.
A common complication in astrophysics is the presence of a magnetic field. For instance, the charged particles making up the solar wind follow spiral paths along magnetic field lines. The velocity of each particle as it gyrates around a field line can be treated similarly to a thermal velocity in an ordinary gas, and in an ordinary gas, the mean thermal velocity is roughly the speed of sound. At the bow shock, the bulk forward velocity of the wind (which is the component of the velocity parallel to the field lines about which the particles gyrate) drops below the speed at which the particles are gyrating.
