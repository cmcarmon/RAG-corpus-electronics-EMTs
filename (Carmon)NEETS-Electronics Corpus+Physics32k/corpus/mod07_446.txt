the largest possible capacitor will provide the best filtering. Remember, also, that the load resistance is an 
important consideration. If load resistance is made small, the load current increases, and the average value 
of output voltage (Eavg) decreases. The RC discharge time constant is a direct function of the value of the 
load resistance; therefore, the rate of capacitor voltage discharge is a direct function of the current through 
the load. The greater the load current, the more rapid the discharge of the capacitor, and the lower the 
average value of output voltage. For this reason, the simple capacitive filter is seldom used with rectifier 
circuits that must supply a relatively large load current. Using the simple capacitive filter in conjunction 
with a full-wave or bridge rectifier provides improved filtering because the increased ripple frequency 
decreases the capacitive reactance of the filter capacitor.
