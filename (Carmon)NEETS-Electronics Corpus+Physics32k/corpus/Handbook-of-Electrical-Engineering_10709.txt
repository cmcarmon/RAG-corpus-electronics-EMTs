Omega is a worldwide radio aid consisting of eight radio stations that emit continuous sine waves at 10 to
13 kHz. Vehicles with precise clocks measure their range to a station by observing the absolute time of reception.
Other vehicles measure the range differences between two stations in the form of phase differences between
the received sinusoids. Differential Omega creates hyperbolic “lanes” that are 10 to 150 nmi wide. The lanes
are indistinguishable from each other by measuring phase; hence the vehicle must count lanes from a point of
known position. Errors are about 2 nmi due to radio propagation irregularities. Omega is used by submarines,
