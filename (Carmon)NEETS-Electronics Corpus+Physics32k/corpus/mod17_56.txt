Facsimile transmissions suffer distortion from all of the common sources of interference experienced 
with ordinary radiotelegraph and radio teletypewriter. Certain characteristics of TIF transmission make it 
less susceptible to complete loss of intelligence. For example, picture quality will be downgraded by any 
noise bursts, since facsimile recording is a continuous recording of signals coming from a receiver. 
However, because the machine scans material at the rate of about 100 lines per inch, each line is only 
1/100th of an inch high. So you can see, if a noise burst interfers with the signal, it will distort a line only 
1/100th of an inch high, leaving the image still readable. Under similar circumstances on a conventional 
rtty circuit, such distortion could cause a portion of the page copy to be unreadable.
