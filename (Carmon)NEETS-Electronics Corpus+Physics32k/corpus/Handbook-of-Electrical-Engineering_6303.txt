As consumer demands drive manufacturers to produce larger picture sizes, the weight and depth of the CRT
and  the  higher  power  and  voltage  requirements  become  serious  limitations.  These  are  reﬂected  in  sharply
increasing receiver costs. To withstand the atmospheric pressures on the evacuated glass envelope, CRT weight
increases  exponentially  with  the  viewable  diagonal.  Nevertheless,  manufacturers  have  continued  to  meet  the
demand for increased screen sizes with larger direct-view tubes. Improved versions of both tridot delta and in-
line guns have been produced. The tridot gun provides small spot size at the expense of critical convergence
adjustments for uniform resolution over the full-tube faceplate. In-line guns permit the use of a self-converging
deﬂection yoke that will maintain dynamic horizontal convergence over the full face of the tube without the
need for correction waveforms. The downside is slightly reduced resolution.
