Law of attraction proponents claim that it affects our relationships because whatever we focus on we experience more of; if an individual focuses on another person's good qualities, for example, those positive qualities will be magnified, and vice-versa. They also claim that by visualizing that a certain person is treating you in a positive manner, then you will attract experiences that match those visualizations. It also claims that a person can attract a romantic relationship with a person who has the characteristics wished for, by creating a mental image of the ideal person and by visualizing the imagined scenes as being real. Similarly, the idea that improving one's self-confidence, charisma and overall subconscious willingness to receive love can attract a partner. These areas can be improved with the help of visualization exercises and manifestation techniques.
