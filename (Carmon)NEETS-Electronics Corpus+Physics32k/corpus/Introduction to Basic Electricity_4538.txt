from memory at any time, with no provision for data 
to be written to it. ROMs are considered nonvola-
tile memory. ROMs use the same decoder circuitry 
as RAM. The stored data are retained even when the 
power is removed. ROMs may be programmed during 
manufacture to be either permanent or replaceable by 
the user, but they are not easily altered and require the 
use of a special device called a burner.
