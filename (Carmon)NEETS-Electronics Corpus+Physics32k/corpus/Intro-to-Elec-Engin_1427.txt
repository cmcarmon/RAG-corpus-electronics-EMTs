Every communication system has a modulator at the transmitting station to structure the
transmitted waveform, and a demodulator (detector) at the receiving end to recover the message
from the received signal. Radio (AM and FM) and television broadcasting are the most familiar
forms of communication through analog signal transmission. The FCC in the United States
regulates the carrier-frequency assignments in order to minimize the interference between nearby
stations. Commercial AM radio broadcasting utilizes the frequency band of 535 to 1605 kHz for
the transmission of voice and music. The carrier-frequency allocations range from 540 kHz to
1600 kHz, with 10-kHz spacing. Each station can occupy a channel bandwidth of only 10 kHz
centered on its carrier. Even though the baseband message signal is limited to a bandwidth of about
5 kHz, the AM broadcasting system adequately meets the need for low-cost mass communication
and general audio entertainment, in spite of lacking high-Ô¨Ådelity behavior.
