the bi-phase circuit, i.e. it charges to approximately 
16.3  V  at  the  peak  of  the  positive  half-cycle  and 
holds the voltage at this level when the diodes are 
in  their  non-conducting  states.  This  component 
operates in exactly the same way as for the bi-phase 
circuit  and  the  secondary  and  rectified  output 
waveforms are shown in Fig. 6.18. Once again note 
that  the  ripple  frequency  is  twice  that  of  the 
incoming a.c. supply. 
  Finally, R–C and L–C ripple filters can be added 
to  bi-phase  and  bridge  rectifier  circuits  in  exactly 
the  same  way  as  those  shown  for  the  half-wave 
rectifier arrangement (see Figs 6.8 and 6.9).
