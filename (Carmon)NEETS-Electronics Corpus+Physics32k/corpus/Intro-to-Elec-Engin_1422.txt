Noise in receiving systems exists in two broad categories: (i) that originated external to the
system (i.e., the one generated by the antenna in response to random waves from cosmic sources
and atmospheric effects), and (ii) internally generated noise (i.e., the one generated within all
circuits making up the receiver, including transmission lines and ampliﬁers). It is common to
model internal noise as having been generated by an external source.
