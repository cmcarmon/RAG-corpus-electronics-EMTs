The aforementioned techniques are important in performing an economic justiﬁcation for a proposed robotic
installation. Still, in general, there are other issues that should be included in the overall analysis. These issues
are of particular importance if one is considering installing a more comprehensive system such as a ﬂexible
manufacturing system that may include many robots and automated systems. As noted by Proth and Hillion
[1990], these issues give rise to criteria that are both quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative criteria include
not only reduced throughput time and work-in-process inventory but also criteria related to increased produc-
tivity coupled with fewer resources. Another measurable criterion is the reduction in management and mon-
itoring staff as a result of smaller quantities and automatic monitoring by sensors. Quality improvement can
also  be  measured  both  quantitatively  and  qualitatively.  Qualitative  beneﬁts  from  quality  improvement  can
include  increased  customer  satisfaction,  increased  competitiveness,  simpliﬁed  production  management,  and
other factors. It should be noted that any beneﬁts and cost reductions for installation of an automated system
are difﬁcult to evaluate and reﬂect a long-term commitment of the corporation.
