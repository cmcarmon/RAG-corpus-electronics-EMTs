Images
A single high-quality color image of 1024 by 1024 pixels with 24 bits per pixel represents about 3 MB of storage
in an uncompressed form, which will take more than 14 minutes to transmit over a 28800-baud modem. It is
therefore very important to use compression to save storage and communication capacity for images. Many
different  algorithms  have  been  proposed  for  image  compression,  and  standards  are  still  being  developed  for
compression of images. For example, the popular GIF standard uses a patented version of Lempelâ€“Ziv coding,
and the JPEG standard being developed by the Joint Photographic Experts Group uses an 8 by 8 discrete cosine
transform  (DCT)  followed  by  quantization  (the  quality  of  which  can  be  chosen  by  the  user)  and  Huffman
coding.  Newer  compression  algorithms  using  wavelets  or  fractals  offer  higher  compression  than  JPEG.  The
compression ratios achieved by these algorithms are very dependent on the image being coded. The lossless
compression  methods  achieve  compression  ratios  of  up  to  about  3:1,  whereas  lossy  compression  methods
achieve ratios up to 50:1 with very little perceptible loss of quality.
