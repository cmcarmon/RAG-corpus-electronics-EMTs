The wetting layer serves as another parameter that can change the physics of a quantum dot. The thickness and composition determine the effect of the wetting layer on the quantum dot, however the thickness is usually roughly 0.5 nanometers. The electronic structure and strain of the quantum dot change as a result of the wetting layer. Theoretically, due to the lattice mismatch, finite thickness wetting layers are not stable and therefore admit some strain on the quantum dot.
