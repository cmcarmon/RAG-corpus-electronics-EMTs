The original goal of the BSIM model was to ﬁt better than the level 2 and 3 models for submicron channel
lengths,  over  a  wider  range  of  geometries,  in  the  subthreshold  region,  and  for  nonzero  back-bias.  Without
question,  BSIM  can  ﬁt  individual  devices  better  than  level  2  and  level  3.  It  also  ﬁts  the  subthreshold  region
better and it ﬁts better for nonzero back-biases. However, its greatest shortcoming is its inability to ﬁt over a
large geometry variation. This occurs because (13.6) is a truncated Taylor series in 1/Leff and 1/Weff terms, and
in order to ﬁt better over varying geometries, higher power terms in 1/Leff and 1/Weff are needed. In addition,
no provision was put into the BSIM model for ﬁtting Gds, so its usefulness for analog applications is questionable.
Many of the BSIM model parameters are unphysical, so it is very hard to understand the signiﬁcance of these
model  parameters.  This  has  profound  implications  for  generating  skew  models  (fast  and  slow  models  to
represent the process corners) and for incorporating temperature dependence. Another ﬂaw of the BSIM model
is its wild behavior for certain values of the model parameters. If model parameters are not speciﬁed for level 2
or 3, they will default to values that will at least force the model to behave well. For BSIM, not specifying certain
model parameters, setting them to zero, or various combinations of values can cause the model to become very
ill-behaved.
