The Language of the Brain
The mass of brain tissue is composed of bundles of nerve cells (neurons) which constitute the fundamental
building  blocks  of  the  nervous  system.  Figure  115.1  is  a  schematic  drawing  of  just  such  a  cell.  It  consists  of
three major components: the cell body (or soma), the receptor zone (or dendrites), and the axon, which carries
electrical signals from the soma to target sites such as muscles, glands, or other neurons. Numbering approx-
imately 20 billion in each human being, these tiny cells come in a variety of sizes and shapes. Although neurons
are  anatomically  distinct  units  having  no  physical  continuity  between  their  processes,  the  axon  ends  on  the
soma and the dendrites of other cells in what is called a synapse. Under the microscope this often stands out
as a spherical enlargement at the end of the axon to which various names have been given, for example, boutons,
