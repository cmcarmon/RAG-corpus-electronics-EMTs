The last, but equally important, characteristic of a wave that we will discuss is the Doppler effect.
The DOPPLER EFFECT is the apparent change in frequency or pitch when a sound source moves either
toward or away from the listener, or when the listener moves either toward or away from the sound
source. This principle, discovered by the Austrian physicist Christian Doppler, applies to all wave motion.
