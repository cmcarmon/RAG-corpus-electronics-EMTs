practical unit, and one that can be used more easily, is the decibel (1/10 bel). You can convert any figure
expressed in bels to decibels by multiplying that figure by 10 or simply by moving the decimal point one
place to the right. Applying this rule, we find that the above ratio of 0.3 bel is equal to 3 decibels.
