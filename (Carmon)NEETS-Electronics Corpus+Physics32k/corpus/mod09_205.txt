WAVE GENERATORS play a prominent role in the field of electronics. They generate signals from 
a few hertz to several gigahertz (109 hertz). Modern wave generators use many different circuits and 
generate such outputs as SINUSOIDAL, SQUARE, RECTANGULAR, SAWTOOTH, and 
TRAPEZOIDAL waveshapes. These waveshapes serve many useful purposes in the electronic circuits 
you will be studying. For example, they are used extensively throughout the television receiver to 
reproduce both picture and sound.
