For example, local area network (LAN) and shipboard applications use multimode graded-index
fibers with a core and cladding size of 62.5/125 m m. In LAN-type environments, macrobend and
microbend losses are hard to predict. Cable tension, bends, and local tie-downs increase macrobend and
microbend losses. In shipboard applications, a ship's cable-way may place physical restrictions, such as
tight bends, on the fiber during cable plant installation. The good microbend and macrobend performance
of 62.5/125 m m fiber permits installation of a rugged and robust cable plant. 62.5/125 m mmultimode
graded-index fibers allow for uncomplicated growth because of high fiber bandwidth capabilities for the
expected short cable runs on board ships.
