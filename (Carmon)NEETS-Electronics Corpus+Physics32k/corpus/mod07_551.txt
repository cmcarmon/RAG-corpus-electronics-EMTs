or electrical equipment, ALWAYS ENSURE THAT THE EQUIPMENT AND ANY TEST 
EQUIPMENT YOU ARE USING IS PROPERLY GROUNDED AND THAT THE RUBBER MAT 
YOU ARE STANDING ON IS IN GOOD CONDITION. As long as you follow these simple rules, you 
should be able to avoid the possibility of becoming an electrical conductor.
