Einstein's radius of the universe is the radius of curvature of space of Einstein's universe, a long-abandoned static model that was supposed to represent our universe in idealized form. Putting

where



c


{\displaystyle c}
is the speed of light,



G


{\displaystyle G}
is the Newtonian gravitational constant, and



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
is the density of space of this universe. The numerical value of Einstein's radius is of the order of 1010 light years.
