ARMATUREâ€”The windings in which the output voltage is generated in a generator or in which input
current creates a magnetic field that interacts with the main field in a motor. Note: Armature is often
used as being identical with ROTOR. This usage is correct only part of the time. See the text and the
entries under ROTOR and STATOR in this Glossary.
