The greater the resistance, the less the conductance, and vice versa. This should make
intuitive sense, resistance and conductance being opposite ways to denote the same essential
electrical property. If two components’ resistances are compared and it is found that compo-
nent ”A” has one-half the resistance of component ”B,” then we could alternatively express this
relationship by saying that component ”A” is twice as conductive as component ”B.” If compo-
nent ”A” has but one-third the resistance of component ”B,” then we could say it is three times
more conductive than component ”B,” and so on.
