As you have seen, a transistor amplifier is limited in its frequency response. You should also
remember from chapter 1 that a VIDEO AMPLIFIER should have a frequency response of 10 hertz (10
Hz) to 6 megahertz (6 MHz). The question has probably occurred to you: How is it possible to "extend"
the range of frequency response of an amplifier?
