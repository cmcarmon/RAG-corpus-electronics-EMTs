Although signal detection and estimation is an area of considerable current research activity, the fundamental
principles  are  quite  well  developed.  These  principles,  which  are  based  on  the  theory  of  statistical  inference,
explain  and  motivate  most  of  the  basic  signal  detection  and  estimation  procedures  used  in  practice.  In  this
section, we will give a brief overview of the basic principles underlying the Ô¨Åeld of signal detection. Estimation
is  treated  elsewhere  this  volume,  notably  in  Section  16.2. A  more  complete  introduction  to  these  subjects  is
found in Poor [1994].
