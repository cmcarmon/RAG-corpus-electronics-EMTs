However, when we’re solving for multiple unknown values, we need to have the same num-
ber of equations as we have unknowns in order to reach a solution. There are several methods
of solving simultaneous equations, all rather intimidating and all too complex for explanation
in this chapter. However, many scientiﬁc and programmable calculators are able to solve for
simultaneous unknowns, so it is recommended to use such a calculator when ﬁrst learning how
to analyze these circuits.
