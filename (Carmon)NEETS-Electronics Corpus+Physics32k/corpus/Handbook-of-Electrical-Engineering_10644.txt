Effective April  28,  1994,  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  (FTC)  must  provide  manufacturers  with  labeling
requirements  for  all  lamps  covered:  ﬂuorescent,  incandescent,  and  reﬂector  incandescent.  Though  not  yet
deﬁned, the proposals include: an energy rating for the lamps, probably LPW (lumens per watt), and energy
cost per year to operate the lamp. The energy efﬁciency label will then allow side-by-side comparison of two
different lamp types, thus enabling consumers to make a more intelligent choice of lamps; taking into account
not just the purchase price, but also the operating cost. Manufacturers must begin applying labels by April 28,
1995. Table 107.9 shows the proposed efﬁciency standards for the ﬂuorescent lamps, and Table 107.10 shows
the proposed efﬁciency standards for incandescent reﬂector lamps.
