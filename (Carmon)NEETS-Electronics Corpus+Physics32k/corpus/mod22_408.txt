In local area networks (LANs), various machines are linked together within a building or adjacent 
buildings. Figure 4-12 shows an example of a LAN. A LAN allows dissimilar machines to exchange 
information within one universal system. With the ability to communicate, the dissimilar machines act as 
a team. The information that exists in one system can be reused without being reentered via keyboard or 
disk into another separate system. A universal system for the integration and exchange of information is 
connected to all input devices. The entire system is usually housed within the same building or the same 
geographic area. A local area network is made up of a communications facility (for example, a coaxial 
cable, such as that used for cable television) and interface units creating a link for the computers and 
terminals to the communications facility. Two designs can be used: broadband or baseband.
