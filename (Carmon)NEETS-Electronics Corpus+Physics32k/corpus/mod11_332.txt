Slot antennas are adaptable for the vhf and uhf ranges. One of their practical advantages is that the 
feed section which energizes the slot may be placed below the large metal surface in which the slot is cut. 
Thus, nothing needs to extend from the surface. In addition, the slot itself may be covered by a section of 
insulating material to provide a seal so that the antenna can be pressurized with dry air. Dry air 
pressurization reduces moisture in the waveguide and prevents arcing.
