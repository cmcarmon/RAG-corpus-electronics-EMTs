Because inductors store the kinetic energy of moving electrons in the form of a magnetic
ﬁeld, they behave quite differently than resistors (which simply dissipate energy in the form of
heat) in a circuit. Energy storage in an inductor is a function of the amount of current through
it. An inductor’s ability to store energy as a function of current results in a tendency to try
