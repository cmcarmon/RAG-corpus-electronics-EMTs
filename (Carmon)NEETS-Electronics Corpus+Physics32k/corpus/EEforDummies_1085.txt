copper pads on one or both sides of the board. The holes are spaced 
0.1 inch apart to accommodate both ICs and discrete components. You 
mount discrete components, such as resistors, diodes, and capacitors, 
to one side of the board by inserting their leads into the holes, soldering 
the leads to the copper pads on the other side of the board, and then 
trimming the leads. You can mount ICs directly to the board or you can 
mount IC sockets to the board and then insert the IC into the socket.
▶✓ Surface mount: These PCBs are solid (no holes). Specially designed 
 surface‐mount components — which look nothing like their through‐
hole counterparts — are mounted and attached to one side of the board. 
Surface‐mount technology (SMT), which includes the boards and com-
ponents, is geared for high‐density circuits and large‐scale automated 
circuit assembly processes.
