The fact that MLE is a function of sufÔ¨Åcient statistics means
that it depends on relevant information. This does not neces-
sarily mean that it will always be the best estimator (in the
sense of, say, minimum variance), for it may not make the best
use of the information. However, when the sample size is large,
all the information relevant to the unknown parameter is
essentially available to the MLE estimator. This explains why
MLE is asymptotically unbiased, it is consistent, and its vari-
ance achieves asymptotically the CRLB.
