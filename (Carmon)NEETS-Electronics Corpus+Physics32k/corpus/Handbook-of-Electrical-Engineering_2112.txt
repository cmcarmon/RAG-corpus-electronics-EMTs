where, as before, f is the frequency in hertz and G is the power spectrum function. Array gain depends on the
coherence of the signal and noise between the sensors of the array. To increase the array gain, it is necessary
to  have  good  coherence  among  the  sensors  for  the  signal,  but  poor  coherence  (incoherent)  for  the  noise.
Coherence of the signal between sensors improves with decreasing separation between the sensors, frequency
of the received waveform, total bandwidth, and integration time. Loss of coherence of the signal could be due
to  ocean  motion,  object  motion,  multipaths,  reverberation,  or  scattering.  The  coherence  function  has  many
uses,  including  measurement  of  SNR  or  array  gain,  system  identiÔ¨Åcation,  and  determination  of  time  delays
