Op Amp Circuit Analysis with PSpice
PSpice for Windows does not have a model for an ideal op amp, although
one  may  create  one  as  a  subcircuit  using  the  Create  Subcircuit line  in
the Tools menu. Rather than creating an ideal op amp, we will use one
of  the  four  nonideal,  commercially  available  op  amps  supplied  in  the
PSpice library eval.slb. The op amp models have the part names LF411,
LM111,  LM324,  and  uA741,  as  shown  in  Fig.  5.34.  Each  of  them  can
be obtained from Draw/Get New Part/libraries . . . /eval.lib or by sim-
ply  selecting  Draw/Get  New  Part and  typing  the  part  name  in  the
PartName dialog box, as usual. Note that each of them requires dc sup-
plies, without which the op amp will not work. The dc supplies should
be connected as shown in Fig. 5.3.
