• When in the current-measuring (”ammeter”) mode, multimeters have practically no resis-
tance between their leads. This is intended to allow electrons to ﬂow through the meter
with the least possible difﬁculty. If this were not the case, the meter would add extra
resistance in the circuit, thereby affecting the current.
