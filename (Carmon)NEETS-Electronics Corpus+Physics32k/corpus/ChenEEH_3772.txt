Modiﬁed Baum-Welch reestimation formulas have been
derived for the three quantities cim, mim, and C im for mixture
density m in state i (Liporace, 1982; Juang et al., 1986). As in
the discrete-observation case, the use of these formulas will
ultimately lead to a model, M, that represents a local max-
imum of the likelihood P(yjM). However, ﬁnding a good local
maximum depends rather critically on a reasonable initial
estimate of the vector and matrix parameters mim and C im
for each i and m. We now describe a convenient procedure
for deriving good separation of the mixture components for
use with a Viterbi procedure.
