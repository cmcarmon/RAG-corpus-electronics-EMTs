loop 2. Both bridges are excited by a common 10-kHz source. The 10-kHz amplifier-oscillator supplies 
10-kHz power to bias the thermistor in feedback loop 1 to produce the resistance required to balance the 
rf bridge. An equal amount of 10-kHz power is supplied by the same oscillator to the second thermistor in 
feedback loop 2 through two series-connected transformers. Feedback loop 2 balances the meter bridge. 
When rf is applied to the thermistor in the detection bridge (but not to the compensation and metering 
bridge), an amount of 10-kHz power is present, equal to the rf power being removed from the detection 
bridge by the self-balancing action of the bridge. Since the rf power replaced the 10-kHz power, the 
detection bridge is in balance; however, the metering bridge must be balanced by its separate feedback 
loop. Sufficient dc power to equal the 10-kHz power lost by the metering bridge is automatically 
replaced, balancing this loop. Hence the dc power applied to the metering bridge thermistor is equal to the 
microwave power applied to the detection bridge. The meter circuit senses the magnitude of the feedback 
current. The resultant meter current passes through a differential amplifier to the indicating meter. The 
two thermistors are matched with respect to their temperature characteristics; therefore, there is only a 
very small amount of drift of the zero point with ambient temperature changes. When there is a change in 
temperature, there is a change in the electrical power needed by the thermistors to maintain constant 
operating resistances. This change is automatically performed by feedback loop 1, which changes the 
amount of 10-kHz power for both thermistors by the proper amount. The dc power in feedback loop 2 is 
not changed; and since it is this dc power that is metered, the temperature change has not affected the 
meter indication.
