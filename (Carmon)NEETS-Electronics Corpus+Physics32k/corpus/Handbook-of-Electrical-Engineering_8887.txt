The low-end of the price/performance spectrum is the personal computer, presently typiÔ¨Åed by Intel Pentium
systems. Three of the manufacturers of Pentium-compatible chip sets (which include the memory controllers)
are Intel, OPTi, and VLSI Technologies. Their controllers provide for memory systems that are simply inter-
leaved, all with minimum bank depths of 256 Kbyte, and maximum system sizes of 192 Mbyte, 128 Mbyte,
and 1 Gbyte, respectively.
