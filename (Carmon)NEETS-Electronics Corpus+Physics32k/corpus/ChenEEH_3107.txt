Induction motors are by far the most common type of motor
used by industry. The most common polyphase induction
motor has a laminated stator core and a three-phase winding
contained in slots. The rotor has two standard conﬁgurations:
squirrel cage and wound rotor. The squirrel cage is the most
common and consists of solid rotor bars that are contained in
slots. The bars are typically made of a good conductor, such as
copper or aluminum. The rotor is usually laminated. The bars
are connected together at each end by a short-circuiting ring.
The squirrel cage has the advantage of being inexpensive and
very rugged, having no insulation. In the wound rotor induc-
tion machine, the rotor winding is an insulated three-phase
winding. The terminals are brought out through slip rings.
The advantage of the wound rotor is that the resistance of the
rotor can be controlled by inserting or removing stationary
resistance through the slip rings. A squirrel cage induction
motor cross section is shown in Figure 4.15 along with a plot
of the ﬂux lines for rated conditions.
