Figure 4-8 illustrates one use of a resolver in solving a composition problem. Assume that we have
two known quantities, vertical and horizontal components, that are represented by E1 and E2,
respectively. Each of these is fed to a stator coil. These two voltages induce a voltage, ET, in one of the
rotor coils. ET represents a voltage that is proportional to the hypotenuse. The voltage induced in the
other rotor coils is fed to a closed-loop servo, which positions the rotor shaft to the angle (direction) of the
hypotenuse.
