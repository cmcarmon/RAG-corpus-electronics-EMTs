You can also connect two or more of the counterâ€™s outputs using diodes to 
produce a variable timing sequence. To do this, connect each anode (posi-
tive side of a diode) to an output pin, and connect all the cathodes (negative 
sides of the diodes) together and then through a resistor. With this arrange-
ment, when any one of the outputs is high, current will flow through the
