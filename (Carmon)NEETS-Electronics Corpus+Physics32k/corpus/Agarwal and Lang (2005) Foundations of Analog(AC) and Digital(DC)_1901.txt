Let us analyze the steady-state response of the first stage of the amplifier
to a small sinusoid signal applied at its input when the output of the first stage
is loaded with the gate capacitance CGS of the second stage. In other words,
our goal is to find the relationship between vo and vi in the presence of the
capacitor CGS when vi = Vi cos(Ï‰t).
