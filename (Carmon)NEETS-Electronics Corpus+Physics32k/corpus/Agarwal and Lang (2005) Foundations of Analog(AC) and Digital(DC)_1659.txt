e) Suppose that the inverter must satisfy a static discipline with high and low voltage
thresholds VIH = VOH = VH = VOL = VL, respectively. You are given a MOSFET
with on resistance RON and threshold VT. Assume that VL < VT < VH < VS
choose a value for RL in terms of the other circuit parameters such that the power
consumed by the inverter is minimized.
