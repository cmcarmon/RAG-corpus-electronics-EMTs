Example 9.3 
 
The astable multivibrator in Fig. 9.6 is required to 
produce a square wave output at 1 kHz. Determine 
suitable values for R3 and R4 if C1 and C2 are both 
10 nF. 
 
Solution 
 
Since  a  square  wave  is  required  and  C1  and  C2 
have  identical  values,  R3  must  be  made  equal  to 
R4. Now:
