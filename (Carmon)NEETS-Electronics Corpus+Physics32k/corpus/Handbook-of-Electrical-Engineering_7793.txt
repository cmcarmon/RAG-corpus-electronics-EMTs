Thus for a given rotational speed 1 and a Ô¨Åxed clock cycle Tc , the minimum mark length , is a linear function
of  track  radius  r,  and  ,  decreases  toward  zero  as  r  approaches  zero.  One  must,  therefore,  pick  a  minimum
usable track radius, rmin, where the spatial extent of the recorded marks is always greater than the minimum
allowed mark length, D0. Equation (80.3) yields
