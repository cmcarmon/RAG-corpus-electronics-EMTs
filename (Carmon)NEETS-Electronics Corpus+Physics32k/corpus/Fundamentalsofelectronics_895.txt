Figure 6.22: In a (3,1) repetition code, only two of the possible eight three-bit data blocks are codewords.
We can represent these bit patterns geometrically with the axes being bit positions in the data block. In
the left plot, the ﬁlled circles represent the codewords [0 0 0] and [1 1 1], the only possible codewords.
The unﬁlled ones correspond to the transmission. The center plot shows that the distance between
codewords is three. Because distance corresponds to ﬂipping a bit, calculating the Hamming distance
geometrically means following the axes rather than going “as the crow ﬂies.” The right plot shows the
data words that result when one error occurs as the codeword goes through the channel. The three data
words are unit distance from the original codeword. Note that the received data word groups do not
overlap, which means the code can correct all single-bit errors.
