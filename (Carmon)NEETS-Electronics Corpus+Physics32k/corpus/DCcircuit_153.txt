A historical note: it was James Prescott Joule, not Georg Simon Ohm, who ﬁrst discovered
the mathematical relationship between power dissipation and current through a resistance.
This discovery, published in 1841, followed the form of the last equation (P = I2R), and is
properly known as Joule’s Law. However, these power equations are so commonly associated
with the Ohm’s Law equations relating voltage, current, and resistance (E=IR ; I=E/R ; and
R=E/I) that they are frequently credited to Ohm.
