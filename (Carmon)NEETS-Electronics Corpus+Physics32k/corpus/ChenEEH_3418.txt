Circuit Breaker
The last component in the basic relaying system is the circuit
breaker. The breakers allow interruption of the current ﬂow,
which is needed if the fault is detected and a tripping com-
mand is issued by the relay. Circuit breakers operate based on
different principles associated with physical means of inter-
rupting the ﬂow of power (Flurscheim, 1985). As a result,
vacuum, air-blast, and oil-ﬁeld breakers are commonly used
depending on the voltage level and required speed of oper-
ation. All breakers try to detect the zero crossing of the current
and interrupt the ﬂow at that time since the energy level to be
