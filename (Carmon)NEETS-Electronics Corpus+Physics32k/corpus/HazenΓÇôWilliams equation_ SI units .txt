When used to calculate the head loss with the International System of Units, the equation becomes:




S
=



h

f


L


=



10.67


Q

1.852





C

1.852




d

4.8704







{\displaystyle S={\frac {h_{f}}{L}}={\frac {10.67\ Q^{1.852}}{C^{1.852}\ d^{4.8704}}}}

where:
S = Hydraulic slope
hf = head loss in meters (water) over the length of pipe
L = length of pipe in meters
Q = volumetric flow rate, m3/s (cubic meters per second)
C = pipe roughness coefficient
d = inside pipe diameter, m (meters)
Note: pressure drop can be computed from head loss as hf Ã— the unit weight of water (e.g., 9810 N/m3 at 4 deg C)
