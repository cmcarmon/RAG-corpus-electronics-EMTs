Waveform and Output Switching
Optimizing the deﬁbrillation waveform has been the subject of much investigation. Because a capacitor is used
to deliver the energy, the waveform is some form of a decaying exponential. Still, there are many parameters
that can be varied when creating a waveform, such as the pulse width, amplitude, decay, and the polarity and
number of phases. In the past, monophasic, truncated, exponential waveforms were common. More recently,
biphasic  waveforms,  in  which  the  direction  of  current  is  reversed  at  some  point  during  the  waveform  by
switching the electrode polarity, have become more popular. This is due to the work of Schuder and others,
who have shown that biphasic waveforms deﬁbrillate with less energy than monophasic waveforms [Schuder
et al., 1984; Feeser et al., 1990].
