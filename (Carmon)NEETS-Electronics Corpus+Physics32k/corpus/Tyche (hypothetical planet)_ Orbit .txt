Whitmire and Matese speculated that Tyche's orbit would lie at approximately 500 times Neptune's distance, some 15,000 AU (2.2Ã—1012 km) from the Sun, a little less than one quarter of a light year. This is well within the Oort cloud, whose boundary is estimated to be beyond 50,000 AU. It would have an orbital period of roughly 1.8 million years. A failed search of older IRAS data suggests that an object of 5 MJ would need to have a distance greater than 10,000 AU. Such a planet would orbit in a plane different from the ecliptic, and would probably have been in a wide-binary orbit at the time of its formation. Wide binaries may form through capture during the dissolution of a star's birth cluster.
