The same result can be obtained by considering energy relations. The energy stored in the angular spring is





E

r
i
n
g



=
∫

k

θ

k

θ



θ

{\displaystyle E_{\mathrm {spring} }=\int k_{\theta }\theta \mathrm {d} \theta ={\frac {1}{2}}k_{\theta }\theta ^{2}}

and the work done by the force is simply the force multiplied by the vertical displacement of the beam end, which is



L
(

−
cos

θ
)


{\displaystyle L(1-\cos \theta )}
. Thus,





E


f

L
(

θ
)



{\displaystyle E_{\mathrm {force} }=\int {F\mathrm {d} x=FL(1-\cos \theta )}}

The energy equilibrium condition




E

{\displaystyle E_{\mathrm {spring} }=E_{\mathrm {force} }}
now yields

L


{\displaystyle F=k_{\theta }/L}
as before (besides from the trivial

{\displaystyle \theta =0}
).
