busses. High-speed switching and synchronous bus structures
are making this noise very signiﬁcant in current technologies.
Inductive noise can combine with capacitive noise to cause
even worse noise than that shown in Figure 7.6. Because the
analysis of inductive effects is highly dependent on layout
and is quite complex, the approach is usually to design the
problem out
through rules rather than analyze arbitrary
conﬁgurations.
