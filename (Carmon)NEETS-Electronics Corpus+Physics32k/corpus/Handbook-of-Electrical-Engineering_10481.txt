Fundamentally, the crossover model states that the humanâ€™s
transfer characteristics will be different for each set of machine
dynamics, but that the form of the composite total open-loop
dynamics  will  be  substantially  invariant.  The  effective  time
delay in Eq. (105.5) is a low-frequency approximation to the
combination of all manner of high-frequency pure delays, lags,
and leads, including a component representing the effects of
