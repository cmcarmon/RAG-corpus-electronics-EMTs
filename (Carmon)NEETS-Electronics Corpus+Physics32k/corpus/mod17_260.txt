Because of these variables, some form of tone control is sometimes used in Navy receivers. Treble
tones are defined as the audio frequencies above approximately 3,000 hertz and bass tones are those
below approximately 300 hertz. Although several methods of tone control can be used, we are only going
to mention the attenuation method. With this method, a decrease in the intensity of one tone can produce
an apparent increase in the intensity of another tone. As an example, letâ€™s look at tones of 400 and 4,000
hertz produced by a speaker with the same intensity. If we reduce the intensity of the 4,000-hertz tone, the
400-hertz tone will appear to be louder, even though its intensity has not actually changed. You should
see from this example that bass emphasis can be accomplished by attenuating treble tones.
