. Different collision detection (CD) techniques: Baseband
compares the received signal with a collision detection
(CD) threshold. If the received signal exceeds the threshold,
it claims that the collision is detected. It may fail to detect a
collision due to signal attenuation. Broadband performs a
bit-by-bit comparison or lets the headend perform colli-
sion detection by checking whether higher signal strength is
received at the headend. If the headend detects a collision, it
sends a jamming signal to the outbound channel.
