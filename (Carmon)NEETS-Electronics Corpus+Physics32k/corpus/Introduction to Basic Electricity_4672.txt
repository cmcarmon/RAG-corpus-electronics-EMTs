Digital computers are classified by size and com-
puting  power.  The  largest  computers  are  called 
mainframes. These computers are expensive, having 
extensive memory and high-speed calculating capa-
bilities. Smaller-scale computers—the minicomputer 
and the microcomputer—are more widely used. Even 
though they represent a small percentage of the total 
computer dollars invested, small-scale computers rep-
resent the largest number of computers in use. The 
microcomputer is the smallest and least expensive of 
the digital computers that still retains all the features 
and characteristics of a computer.
