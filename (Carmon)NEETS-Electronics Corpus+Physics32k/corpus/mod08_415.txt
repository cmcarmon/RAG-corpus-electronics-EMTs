The magnetic amplifier is important, however, to many phases of naval engineering because it
provides a rugged, trouble-free device that has many applications aboard ship and in aircraft. These
applications include throttle controls on the main engines of ships; speed, frequency, voltage, current, and
temperature controls on auxiliary equipment; and fire control, servomechanisms, and stabilizers for guns,
radar, and sonar equipment.
