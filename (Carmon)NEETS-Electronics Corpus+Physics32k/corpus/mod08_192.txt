You should remember that if frequency is low, capacitive reactance will be high and inductive reactance
will be low. This is shown by the position of the variable resistors that represent the reactances. Notice
that XL1  and XL2 are low; therefore, they do not "drop" very much of the input and output signals. XC4
and XC5 are high; these reactances tend to "block" the input and output signals and keep them from going
to the power supplies (VBB and VCC). Notice that the output signal is larger in amplitude than the input
signal.
