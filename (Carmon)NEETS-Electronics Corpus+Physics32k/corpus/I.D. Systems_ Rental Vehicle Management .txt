In 2011, I.D. Systems and Avis Budget Group signed an exclusive agreement to deploy I.D. Systems' wireless vehicle management technology on more than 25,000 Avis Budget vehicles, enabling Avis customers to self-manage their rentals by computer or smartphone. The technology can also automate and expedite the rental and return process, track vehicle mileage, measure fuel consumption, and remotely control a vehicle's door locks. In February 2013, the company was awarded its second patent (patent number 8370268) for an automated wireless rental car management system.
