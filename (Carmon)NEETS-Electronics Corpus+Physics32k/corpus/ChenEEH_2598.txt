Most frequently used conﬁgurations for planar band-pass
ﬁlters are direct-coupled, parallel-coupled,
interdigital,
comb-line, hairpin-line, dual-mode ring, and square-patch
resonators, some of which are shown in Figure 7.37. Direct-
coupled resonator ﬁlters are of excessive length that can be
reduced by using a parallel-coupled geometry. The parallel
coupling can be made stronger to achieve a larger bandwidth.
The interdigital combline, and hairpin-line have side-to-side
inter-resonator coupling schemes, and ﬁlters can be made
compact if spurious responses are suppressed. In addition,
