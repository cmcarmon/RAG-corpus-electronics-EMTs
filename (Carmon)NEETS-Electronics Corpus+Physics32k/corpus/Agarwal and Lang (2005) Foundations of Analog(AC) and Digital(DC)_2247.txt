where the diode current iD is zero (the diode is an open circuit). This suggests
a very simple analysis technique: Draw two subcircuits corresponding to the
two diode states, and analyze each subcircuit. Because in each subcircuit the
diode is either a short or an open circuit, the subcircuits are linear. Hence linear
analysis methods can again be used to find the output voltage. Some insight is
then required to piece together a complete solution from these two parts.
