One of the first hubodometers was designed by Howard G. Engler, co-founder of Engler Instruments with his brother, Clifford E. Engler, in 1952. Numerous attempts at electronic versions have been attempted, including a Stemco version patented in 1991 (pat #4,989,222). The first hubodometer with no moving parts was made by Stemco and released in 2002 under the name DataTrac, patent number 6,940,940 granted in 2005. This part was then made programmable in 2006. An improved version of the DataTrac, which utilizes two 3-axis accelerometers, was released in 2011 under patent number 8,352,210 (granted Jan 2013). The additional 3-axis device allows updates to the counting algorithms so that the device can now be used in off-road applications with high vibrations and instantaneous accelerations. The system now uses a differential acceleration analysis to extract distance from the center of the wheel, allowing for increased accuracies. The display now stays on at low speeds so that the counting operations can be viewed in realtime.
