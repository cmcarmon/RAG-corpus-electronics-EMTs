Field theory had its origins in the 18th century in a mathematical formulation of Newtonian mechanics, but it was seen as deficient as it implied action at a distance. In 1852, Michael Faraday treated the magnetic field as a physical object, reasoning about lines of force. James Clerk Maxwell used Faraday's conceptualisation to help formulate his unification of electricity and magnetism in his electromagnetic theory.
With Albert Einstein's special relativity and the Michelson-Morley experiment, it became clear that electromagnetic waves did not travel as vibrations in a physical aether; and there was in Einstein's physics no difference between the effects of a field and action at a distance.
In quantum field theory, fields become the fundamental objects of study, and particles are excitations of these fields.
