In the book Chronophobia: On Time in the Art of the 1960s by Pamela Lee, Chronophobia is described as “an experience of unease and anxiety about time, a feeling that events are moving too fast and are thus hard to make sense of.” In Peter PaulAnnas Lichtenstein's review he reveals it can be caused by a traumatic experience in one's childhood, genetics, incarceration, or old age. Most traumatic experiences can lead to personal withdrawals from one's surroundings such as dissociation, depersonalization, or derealisation. A person may be genetically affected after the traumatic experience due to Adrenal insufficiency. Those with these insufficiencies are more susceptible to anxiety and fear. When people are incarcerated, they experience a heightened sense of anxiety. The stress of prison makes inmates especially at risk. Inmates start to contemplate time extensively because they are incarcerated for a certain amount of time. It is not uncommon for prison inmates to count-down the days until their release. The elderly also exhibit more of a risk because they feel that death is closer than it had ever been before in their life. The threat of death can cause an overwhelming sensation of chronophobia.
