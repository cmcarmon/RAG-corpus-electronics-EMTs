What kind of circuit would act as a frequency-determining network? In general, a frequency-
determining network is a circuit that provides the desired response at a particular frequency. This
response could be maximum impedance or minimum impedance; it all depends on how the frequency-
determining network is used. You will see more about frequency-determining networks in NEETS,
Module 9â€”Introduction to Wave-Generation and Shaping Circuits. As you have seen, the frequency-
determining network needed for an rf amplifier should have maximum impedance at the desired
frequency.
