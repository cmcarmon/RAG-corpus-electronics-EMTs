Communications systems in the 1 gigahertz to 10 gigahertz portion of the radio frequency spectrum 
use line-of-sight propagation. Propagation takes place in the lower atmosphere (troposphere). It is 
affected by factors such as barometric pressure, temperature, water vapor, turbulence, and stratification 
(forming of atmospheric layers).
