As stated earlier, the magnetic amplifier does not amplify magnetism, but uses electromagnetism to
amplify a signal. It is a power amplifier with a very limited frequency response. Technically, it falls into
the classification of an audio amplifier; but, since the frequency response is normally limited to 100 hertz
and below, the magnetic amplifier is more correctly called a low-frequency amplifier.
