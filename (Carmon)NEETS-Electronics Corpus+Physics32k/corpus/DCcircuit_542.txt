This application of the potentiometer is a very useful means of obtaining a variable voltage
from a ﬁxed-voltage source such as a battery. If a circuit you’re building requires a certain
amount of voltage that is less than the value of an available battery’s voltage, you may connect
the outer terminals of a potentiometer across that battery and ”dial up” whatever voltage you
need between the potentiometer wiper and one of the outer terminals for use in your circuit:
