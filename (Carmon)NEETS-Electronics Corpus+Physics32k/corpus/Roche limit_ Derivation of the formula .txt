In order to determine the Roche limit, consider a small mass



u


{\displaystyle u}
on the surface of the satellite closest to the primary. There are two forces on this mass



u


{\displaystyle u}
: the gravitational pull towards the satellite and the gravitational pull towards the primary. Assume that the satellite is in free fall around the primary and that the tidal force is the only relevant term of the gravitational attraction of the primary. This assumption is a simplification as free-fall only truly applies to the planetary center, but will suffice for this derivation.
The gravitational pull




F

{\displaystyle F_{\text{G}}}
on the mass



u


{\displaystyle u}
towards the satellite with mass



m


{\displaystyle m}
and radius



r


{\displaystyle r}
can be expressed according to Newton's law of gravitation.

the tidal force

{\displaystyle F_{\text{T}}}
on the mass



u


{\displaystyle u}
towards the primary with radius



R


{\displaystyle R}
and mass



M


{\displaystyle M}
, at a distance



d


{\displaystyle d}
between the centers of the two bodies, can be expressed approximately as





F

T


=

G
M

3






{\displaystyle F_{\text{T}}={\frac {2GMur}{d^{3}}}}
.
To obtain this approximation, find the difference in the primary's gravitational pull on the center of the satellite and on the edge of the satellite closest to the primary:

In the approximation where



r
≪
R


{\displaystyle r\ll R}
and



R
<
d


{\displaystyle R<d}
, it can be said that the




r

{\displaystyle r^{2}}
in the numerator and every term with



r


{\displaystyle r}
in the denominator goes to zero, which gives us:





F

{\displaystyle F_{\text{T}}=GMu{\frac {2dr}{d^{4}}}}

{\displaystyle F_{\text{T}}={\frac {2GMur}{d^{3}}}}

The Roche limit is reached when the gravitational force and the tidal force balance each other out.

{\displaystyle F_{\text{G}}=F_{\text{T}}\;}

{\displaystyle d=r\left(2\,{\frac {M}{m}}\right)^{\frac {1}{3}}}

The radius of the satellite should not appear in the expression for the limit, so it is re-written in terms of densities.
For a sphere the mass



M


{\displaystyle M}
can be written as




M
=

R

{\displaystyle M={\frac {4\pi \rho _{M}R^{3}}{3}}}
where



R


{\displaystyle R}

And likewise

ρ

m



r

3




{\displaystyle m={\frac {4\pi \rho _{m}r^{3}}{3}}}
where



r


{\displaystyle r}
is the radius of the satellite.
Substituting for the masses in the equation for the Roche limit, and cancelling out
