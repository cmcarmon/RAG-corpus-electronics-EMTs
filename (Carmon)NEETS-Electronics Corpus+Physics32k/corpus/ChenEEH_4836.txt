Consider the use of object-oriented middleware to provide
the distributed communication channel for the publish/sub-
scribe method of communications. Object-oriented middle-
ware treats the software and hardware components connected
to it as objects. Ordinarily, when one object on a distributed
communication network calls a method of another object, it
would have to know which object had that method and be able
to locate it on the network. The middleware makes this
method request transparent to the object that makes the call
by using remote procedure calls (RPCs). Because all objects
have a standard interface and all coupling between objects is
mediated through the communication channel (that is, the
objects are not required to be coupled together directly),
adding or removing objects from the overall system can be
done in a much simpler manner than is possible if the com-
ponents are all tightly coupled. Consider three different alter-
natives for object-oriented middleware: DCOM, CORBA, and
Java-based technologies (including Jini technology) (Szy-
perski, 1998).
