The shunt motor is essentially a constant-speed machine with a low speed regulation. As
seen from Equation (13.4.8), the speed is inversely proportional to the ﬁeld ﬂux, and thus it can
be varied by controlling the ﬁeld ﬂux. When the motor operates at very low values of ﬁeld ﬂux,
however, the speed will be high, and if the ﬁeld becomes open-circuited, the speed will rise rapidly
beyond the permissible limit governed by the mechanical structure. In order to limit the speed to
a safe value, when a shunt motor is to be designed to operate with a low value of shunt-ﬁeld ﬂux,
it is usually ﬁtted with a small cumulative series winding, known as a stabilizing winding.
