To give you a better idea of what you can expect to see on your microcomputer display screen, we 
will show a few fundamental disk operating system commands and messages. Again, the functions of 
each operating system are about the same, but each may use a different command to do about the same 
thing. For example, try not to get confused because CP/M uses the command PIP (peripheral interchange 
program) to copy a file, while MS-DOS uses the command COPY.
