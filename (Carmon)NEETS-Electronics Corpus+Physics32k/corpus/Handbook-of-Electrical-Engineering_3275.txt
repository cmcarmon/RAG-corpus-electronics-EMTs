Brightness and Illumination
The ï¬‚ux density of a light beam emitted from a  point source decreases with the square of distance from it.
Light sources are typically extended sources (being larger than point sources). The illumination of a surface
from light emitted from an extended source can be calculated using Fig. 31.5.
