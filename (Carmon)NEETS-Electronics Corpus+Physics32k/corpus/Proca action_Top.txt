In physics, specifically field theory and particle physics, the Proca action describes a massive spin-1 field of mass m in Minkowski spacetime. The corresponding equation is a relativistic wave equation called the Proca equation. The Proca action and equation are named after Romanian physicist Alexandru Proca.
The Proca equation is involved in the Standard model and describes there the three massive vector bosons, i.e. the Z and W bosons.
