The common-base transistor clamper is similar to the dual diode limiter in figure 4-15, except for the 
addition of a transistor. In the previous clampers, we have clamped the output signal to a reference. In the 
transistor common-base clamper, we want to clamp the amplitude of the input to no more than nor less 
than certain values in the output. Also, we do not want phase inversion in the output. View (A) of figure 
4-24 shows such a circuit. The transistor does not amplify the input and the output is not inverted. 
However, the two diode circuits serve to clamp the output between −2 volts and −8 volts, no matter what 
the varying input positive and negative extremes.
