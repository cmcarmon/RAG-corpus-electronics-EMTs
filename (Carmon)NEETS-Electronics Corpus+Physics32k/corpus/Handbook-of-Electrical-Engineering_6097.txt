New packages became available for business and engineering which were based on either the spreadsheet or
database principle. These also had the ability to produce graphical output. It was no longer essential to know
a programming language to do even quite complex engineering analysis. The programming was usually inef-
Ô¨Åcient and obtaining results was more laborious, e.g., each iteration had to be started by hand. But, as engineers
had to use these packages for other work, they became very convenient tools.
