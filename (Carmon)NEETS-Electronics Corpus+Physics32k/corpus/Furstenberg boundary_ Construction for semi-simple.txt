In general, let G be a semi-simple Lie group and μ a probability measure on G that is absolutely continuous. A function f on G is μ-harmonic if it satisfies the mean value property with respect to the measure μ:




f
(
g
)
=

∫

G


f
(
g

g
′

)

d
μ
(

g

)


{\displaystyle f(g)=\int _{G}f(gg')\,d\mu (g')}

There is then a compact space Π, with a G action and measure ν, such that any bounded harmonic function on G is given by




f
(
g
)
=

∫

d

(

{\displaystyle f(g)=\int _{\Pi }{\hat {f}}(gp)\,d\nu (p)}

for some bounded function






f
^





{\displaystyle {\hat {f}}}
on Π.
The space Π and measure ν depend on the measure μ (and so, what precisely constitutes a harmonic function). However, it turns out that although there are many possibilities for the measure ν (which always depends genuinely on μ), there are only a finite number of spaces Π (up to isomorphism): these are homogeneous spaces of G that are quotients of G by some parabolic subgroup, which can be described completely in terms of root data and a given Iwasawa decomposition. Moreover, there is a maximal such space, with quotient maps going down to all of the other spaces, that is called the Furstenberg boundary.
