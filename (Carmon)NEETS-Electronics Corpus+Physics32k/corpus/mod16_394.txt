Electric power is measured by means of a wattmeter. This instrument is of the electrodynamometer
type. As shown in figure 3-18, it consists of a pair of fixed coils, known as current coils, and a moving
coil, called the voltage (potential) coil. The fixed current coils are wound with a few turns of a relatively
large conductor. The voltage coil is wound with many turns of fine wire. It is mounted on a shaft that is
supported in jeweled bearings so that it can turn inside the stationary coils. The movable coil carries a
needle (pointer) that moves over a suitably graduated scale. Coil springs hold the needle at the zero
position in the absence of a signal.
