In ordinary affairs as well as in science, engineering, and other fields, all of the characteristics of an effect will be completely explained by the set of proximate causes. If a postulated (hypothesized) set of proximate causes (also known as "direct factors") does not fully explain all of the characteristics (attributes) of the effect, then the set of direct factors is either wrong or incomplete.
The set of direct factors (of an effect) has a number of known properties:
Predisposing factors that set the stage for the effect and a precipitating factor that brought the effect into being. (The future recurrence of the effect may be precluded by negating certain predisposing factors and/or by negating the precipitating factor. For example, the detonation of a car bomb could be precluded by removing the bomb or by not turning the ignition key.)
These factors may be considered to be predisposing factors:
The nature of the effect
The magnitude (or intensity) of the effect
The location of the effect

May be considered to be precipitating:
The timing of the effect.
The vulnerability for the effect
the creation of the effect
The factor(s) that made the effect as large [intense] as it was
The factor(s) that kept the magnitude [intensity] from being even greater.

The set of direct factors will always include:
Something that can be affected
Something that can do the affecting
The proximity of the foregoing
The simultaneity of the first two
The absence of any intervening separation between the first two. (This is the paradigm of "barrier analysis.")
