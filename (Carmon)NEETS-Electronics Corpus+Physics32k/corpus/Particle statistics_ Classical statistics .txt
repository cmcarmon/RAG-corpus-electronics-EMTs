In classical mechanics, all particles (fundamental and composite particles, atoms, molecules, electrons, etc.) in the system are considered distinguishable. This means that individual particles in a system can be tracked. As a consequence, changing the position of any two particles in the system leads to a completely different configuration of the entire system. Furthermore, there is no restriction on placing more than one particle in any given state accessible to the system. These characteristics of classical positions are called Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics (or M–B statistics).
