Hydraulic
Nonreversible, low-frequency, high-power underwater projectors can be constructed utilizing hydraulic forces
acting  to  move  large  pistons.  Electroacoustic  transduction  is  achieved  by  modulating  the  hydraulic  pressure
with a spool valve actuated by an electrostrictive (PZT) stack.
