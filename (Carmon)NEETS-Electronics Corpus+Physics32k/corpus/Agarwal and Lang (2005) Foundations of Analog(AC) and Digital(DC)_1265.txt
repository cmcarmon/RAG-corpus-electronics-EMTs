where the second equality results from the substitution of Equation 9.38 and
then Equation 9.37. Thus, we see that the reciprocal capacitances of capacitors
in series add. This is consistent with the physical derivation of capacitance
in Equation 9.4 since placing capacitors in series essentially increases their
combined gap length.
