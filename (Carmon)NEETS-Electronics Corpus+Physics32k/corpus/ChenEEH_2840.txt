Application of FDTD solutions of Maxwell’s equations to
problems such as the one illustrated in this ﬁgure shows great
promise in allowing the detailed study of a variety of novel
nonlinear optical wave species that may one day be used to
implement all-optical switching circuits (light switching light),
attaining speeds 10,000 times faster than those of the best
semiconductor circuits today. The implications may be pro-
found for the realization of ‘‘optonics,’’ a proposed successor
technology to electronics that would integrate optical-ﬁber
interconnects and optical microchips into systems of un-
imaginable information-processing capability.
