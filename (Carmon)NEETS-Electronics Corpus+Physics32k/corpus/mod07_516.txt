In this voltage regulator, Q1 has a constant voltage applied to its base. This voltage is often called 
the reference voltage. As changes in the circuit output voltage occur, they are sensed at the emitter of Q1 
producing a corresponding change in the forward bias of the transistor. In other words, Q1 compensates 
by increasing or decreasing its resistance in order to change the circuit voltage division.
