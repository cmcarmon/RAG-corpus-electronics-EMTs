Difficulty may be experienced when you attempt to measure wire-wound resistors. To obtain a sharp
balance on the indicator, you can shunt the resistor with a variable capacitor and adjust the capacitor for
the clearest indication. The resistance measurement will not be affected by this reactance neutralization.
