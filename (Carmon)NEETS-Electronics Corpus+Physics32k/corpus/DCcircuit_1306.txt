The amount of magnetic ﬁeld force generated by a coiled wire is proportional to the current
through the wire multiplied by the number of ”turns” or ”wraps” of wire in the coil. This ﬁeld
force is called magnetomotive force (mmf), and is very much analogous to electromotive force
(E) in an electric circuit.
