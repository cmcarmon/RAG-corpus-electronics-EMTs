above the tuned frequency. As you approach the tuned frequency, the input level required to maintain a
given output level will fall. As you pass the tuned frequency, the required input level will rise. Input
voltage levels are then compared with frequency. They can be plotted on paper or you might view them
on an oscilloscope. They would appear in the form of a response curve. The steepness of the response
curve at the tuned frequency indicates the selectivity of the receiver.
