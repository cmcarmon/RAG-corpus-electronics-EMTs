Because of the extensive growth of electronic communication since the Second World War, information is
very often presented on CRTs, mainly when the information content exceeds 100,000 picture elements (pixels).
Monochrome CRTs are widely used for computer terminals, radars, oscilloscopes, projection systems, etc.,
while high resolution color CRTs are preferred for imaging from computers, such as multimedia, CAD-CAM
systems and digital image processors [Keller, 1991].
