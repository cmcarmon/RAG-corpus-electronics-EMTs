Notice the RLCGS2 factor in Equation 10.73. In typical circuits, a ballpark
estimate of the delay can be obtained by simply taking the product of the
capacitance and the effective resistance through which it charges. In our case,
tpd,1→0 ≈ RLCGS2 = 10 × 103 × 100 × 10
−15 = 1 ns. Similarly, the ballpark
estimate of tpd,0→1 is given by tpd,0→1 ≈ RTHCGS2 = 10/11 × 103 × 100 ×
−15 = 0.09 ns.

Computing tpd
By our definition, the propagation delay of the gate tpd is the greater of the
rising and falling delays. In other words,
