. Delivery of session description: Once the user is located,
SIP performs the second function of delivering a descrip-
tion of the session that the user is invited to. SIP itself is
opaque to the session description in the sense that it does
not know anything about the session. It merely notiÔ¨Åes
the user about the protocol to be used so that the user can
understand the session description. Session Description
Protocol (SDP) is the most common protocol used for
this purpose. SIP can also be used to decide a common
format to describe a session so that protocols other than
SDP can also be used.
