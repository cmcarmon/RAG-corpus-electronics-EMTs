All these units for speciﬁc resistance are valid for any material (Ω-cmil/ft, Ω-m, or Ω-cm).
One might prefer to use Ω-cmil/ft, however, when dealing with round wire where the cross-
sectional area is already known in circular mils. Conversely, when dealing with odd-shaped
busbar or custom busbar cut out of metal stock, where only the linear dimensions of length,
width, and height are known, the speciﬁc resistance units of Ω-meter or Ω-cm may be more
appropriate.
