The NA is a convenient way to measure the light-gathering ability of an optical fiber. It is used to
measure source-to-fiber power-coupling efficiencies. A high NA indicates a high source-to-fiber coupling
efficiency. Source-to-fiber coupling efficiency is described in chapter 6. Typical values of NA range from
0.20 to 0.29 for glass fibers. Plastic fibers generally have a higher NA. An NA for plastic fibers can be
higher than 0.50.
