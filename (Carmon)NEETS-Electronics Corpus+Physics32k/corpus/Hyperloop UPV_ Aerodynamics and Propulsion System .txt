The Hyperloop Makers UPV proposes a propulsion system that consists in compressing the incoming air flowing along an inner tube up to a turbine that partially recovers energy and a nozzle that expands the air at the outlet of the pod producing thrust.
In the CFD analysis, the obtained results validate that the thrust needed to achieve cruise speed and to keep it constant is more than enough.
Additionally, this system allows braking with a constant deceleration by controlling the compressor discharge valve and/or compressor operating point.
At low speeds, the propulsion system consists of a mechanical traction mechanism of retractable wheels which is more efficient than the aerodynamic propulsion at these speeds.
Nevertheless, a complementary off-pod propulsion system could be proposed in order to reduce the energetic costs due to the initial acceleration and downsize the battery requirements.
At a cruise speed of 276 m/s (roughly 1000 km/h) the pod consumption per passenger is as low as 35 kW.
