The focus for applications of these new techniques is on a
representative problem from automotive engineering, that of
idle speed control for the typical spark-ignited, internal com-
bustion (IC) engine. Idle is one of the most frequently encoun-
tered operating conditions in city driving. Thus, there is
motivation for adjustment to the lowest possible idle speed
(i.e., while keeping smooth engine performance) as a way of
reducing fuel consumption. Factors that most affect the idle
speed are the intake-airï¬‚ow and the ignition timing. The idle
speed can therefore be controlled by changing the air quantity
(charge adjustment) and/or the ignition timing. In this chap-
ter, we will be concerned with disturbance torques acting on
the plant model and being able to maintain nearly constant
idle speed. These disturbance torques may arise from several
sources, such as the engagement of the automatic transmis-
sion, the turning-on (cycling) of the air conditioner unit, or
the effects of loading with the power steering system.
