covered  with  a  magnetic  material  for  recording  information.  Each  platter  contains  a  number  of  circular
. A sector is a unit of a track that is physically read or written at the same time. In traditional
recording 
magnetic disks, the constant angular rotation of the platters dictates that sectors on inner tracks are recorded
more densely than sectors on the outer tracks. Thus, the platter can spin at a constant rate and the same amount
of data can be recorded on the inner and outer tracks.
 Some modern disks use zone recording techniques to

more densely record data on the outer tracks, but this requires more sophisticated read/write electronics.
