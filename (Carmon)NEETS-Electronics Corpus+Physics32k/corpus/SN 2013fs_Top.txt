SN 2013fs is a supernova, located in the spiral galaxy NGC 7610, discovered by the Intermediate Palomar Transient Factory sky survey at Palomar Observatory in October 2013 (and originally named iPTFâ€‰13dqy). It was discovered approximately three hours from explosion (first light) and was observed in ultraviolet and X-ray wavelengths, among others, within several hours. Optical spectra were obtained beginning at six hours from explosion, making these the earliest such detailed observations ever made of a supernova.
The star that produced SN 2013fs was a red supergiant with a mass 10 times the mass of our Sun, an effective temperature of 3,500 K, a radius 607 times the size of our sun, and no more than a few million years old when it exploded. The star was surrounded by a relatively dense shell of gas shed by the star within the year before it exploded. Radiation emitted by the supernova explosion illuminated this shell, which had a mass of approximately one-thousandth the mass of our sun, and its outer fringe was about 5 times the distance of Neptune from our sun.
