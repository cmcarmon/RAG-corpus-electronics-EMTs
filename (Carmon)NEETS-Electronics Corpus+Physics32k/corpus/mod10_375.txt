Tropospheric scattering, on the other hand, provides a usable signal at distances beyond the point 
where the diffracted space wave drops to an unusable level. This is because of the height at which 
scattering takes place. The turbulence that causes the scattering can be visualized as a relay station located 
above the horizon; it receives the transmitted energy and then reradiates it in a forward direction to some 
point beyond the line-of-sight distance. A high gain receiving antenna aimed toward this scattered energy 
can then capture it.
