Packaging and Cost
The simplest processors are housed in normal dual in-line packages (DIP) of 16 pins or more, spaced 0.3 inches
wide.  Thus,  they  resemble  conventional  transistor-transistor  logic  (TTL)  packages.  The  mid-range  ones  are
usually in large DIP packages, 0.8 inches wide, with 40 to 68 pins (2 to 4 inches long.) The high-performance
ones come in multirow pin packages and may require 200 connections and may use unusual chip sockets. The
high performance chips may require special cooling.
