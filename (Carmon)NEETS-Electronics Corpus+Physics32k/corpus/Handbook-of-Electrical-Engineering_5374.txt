Even the most developed and commercialized of the photovol-
taics approaches, crystalline Si, has required many redirections of
its module construction to meet either operational or cost limi-
tations over the past 25 years. Two examples highlight this ability and necessity for change. First, the module
has been redesigned to eliminate framing to decrease materials cost, and improve loading (weight) and aero-
dynamics when conﬁgured into the array. In this same area, some modules, traditionally only the DC delivery
system, have integrated the inverter into its construction to meet AC energy requirements. The second example
has to do with the encapsulation of the Si cells in a polymer — commonly ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA). This
encapsulant was identiﬁed through several development programs as a cost-effective and environment-resistant
material for PV modules in the late 1970s. In the mid-1980s, the EVA in some modules was observed to turn
yellow and brown. Subsequently, new and improved polymer encapsulants have also been developed to replace
the original EVA formulations and UV-absortion glass has been implemented.
