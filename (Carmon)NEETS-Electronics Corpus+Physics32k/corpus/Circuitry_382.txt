Two  practical  emitter-follower  circuits  are  shown 
in Figs 7.41 and 7.42. These circuits offer a voltage 
gain of unity (1) but are ideal for matching a high 
resistance  source  to  a  low  resistance  load.  It  is 
important  to  note  that  the  input  resistance  varies 
with the load connected to the output of the circuit 
(it is typically in the range 50 kP to 150 kP). The 
input resistance can be calculated by multiplying hfe 
by the effective resistance of R2 in parallel with the 
load connected to the output terminals. 
  Figure 7.42 is an improved version of Fig. 7.41 
in  which  the  base  current  is  derived  from  the 
potential  divider  formed  by  R1 and  R2.  Note, 
however, that the input resistance is reduced since 
R1 and  R2 effectively  appear  in  parallel  with  the 
input.  The  input  resistance  of  the  stage  is  thus 
typically in the region of 40 kP to 70 kP.
