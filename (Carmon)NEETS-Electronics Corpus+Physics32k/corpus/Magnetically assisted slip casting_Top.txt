Magnetically-assisted slip casting is a manufacturing technique that uses anisotropic stiff nanoparticle platelets in a ceramic, metal or polymer functional matrix to produce layered objects that can mimic natural objects such as nacre. Each layer of platelets is oriented in a different direction, giving the resulting object greater strength. The inventors claimed that the process is 10x faster than commercial 3D printing. The magnetisation and orientation of the ceramic platelets has been patented.
