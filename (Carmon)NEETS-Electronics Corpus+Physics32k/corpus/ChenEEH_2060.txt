It is easy to see that a TPrTN TN is a PrTN N with a
temporal logic formula f. The temporal logic formula is de-
ﬁned according to the net graph NG using logical connectives
and operators, which can be viewed as a part of the underlying
algebraic speciﬁcation (Sig, V, H). The temporal logic formula f
is evaluated using the dynamic behaviors of N. By incorpo-
rating a temporal formula into the deﬁnition of a PrTN, we are
able to explicitly specify and verify many system properties
such as fairness.
