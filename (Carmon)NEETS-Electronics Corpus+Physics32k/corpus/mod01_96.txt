Benjamin Franklin, American statesman, inventor, and philosopher, is credited with first using the
terms POSITIVE and NEGATIVE to describe the two opposite kinds of electricity. The charge produced
on a glass rod when it is rubbed with silk, Franklin labeled positive. He attached the term negative to the
charge produced on the silk. Those bodies which were not electrified or charged, he called NEUTRAL.
