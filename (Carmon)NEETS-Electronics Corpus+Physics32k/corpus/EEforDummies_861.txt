A word to the wise: It doesnâ€™t take much electrical current to seriously hurt 
or even kill you. Even the most seasoned professionals take appropriate 
precautions to stay safe. I strongly suggest (insist, even) that you thoroughly 
read the safety information provided (hey, I took great pains putting it 
together) and, before you start each project, review the safety checklist at 
the end of this chapter. Promise?
