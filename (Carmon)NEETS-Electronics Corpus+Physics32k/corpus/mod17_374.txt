The teletypewriter receives messages and prints them on page-size copy paper. In addition, it can 
receive and record messages on perforated tape. You can use the keyboard or perforated tape to send 
messages. Page print monitoring is available with both methods. The set shown can prepare perforated 
and printed tape for separate transmission. It does this with or without simultaneous transmission and 
page-print monitoring. The combinations of services available are extensive.
