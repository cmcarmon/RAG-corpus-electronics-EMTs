case. An internal fan circulates the nitrogen over and through the heat-producing elements and then 
through the air duct. While passing through the air duct, the nitrogen loses its heat to the bottom of the 
case. This heat is then transferred by convection through fins on the bottom of the case and by conduction 
through the mounting feet.
