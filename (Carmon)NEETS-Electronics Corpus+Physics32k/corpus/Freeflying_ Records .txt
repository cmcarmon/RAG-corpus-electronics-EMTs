The world's largest vertical (head down) formation took place on Friday, 31 July 2015, when a multinational team of 164 skydivers, some traveling at speeds of over 200 mph, linked over Skydive Chicago, in Ottawa, Illinois, United States. This broke the previous record of 138 linked skydivers, set on Saturday, 4 August 2012, also at Skydive Chicago.
Marc Hauser set the world record for the fastest horizontal free fall at 304 km/h in Empuriabrava, Spain, without specialized equipment, in October 2012.
