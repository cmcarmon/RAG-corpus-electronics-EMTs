The Faraday paradox or Faraday's paradox is any experiment in which Michael Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction appears to predict an incorrect result. The paradoxes fall into two classes:
Faraday's law appears to predict that there will be zero EMF but there is a non-zero EMF.
Faraday's law appears to predict that there will be a non-zero EMF but there is zero EMF.
Faraday deduced his law of induction in 1831, after inventing the first electromagnetic generator or dynamo, but was never satisfied with his own explanation of the paradox.
