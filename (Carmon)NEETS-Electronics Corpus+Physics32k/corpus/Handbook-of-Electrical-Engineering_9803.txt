Stabilizable: A system is stabilizable if all its unstable modes are controllable.
State variables: A set of variables that completely summarize the systemâ€™s status in the following sense. If all
states xi are known at time t0, then the values of all states and outputs can be determined uniquely for
any time t1 > t0, provided the inputs are known from t0 onward. State variables are components in the
state vector. State space is a vector space containing the state vectors.
