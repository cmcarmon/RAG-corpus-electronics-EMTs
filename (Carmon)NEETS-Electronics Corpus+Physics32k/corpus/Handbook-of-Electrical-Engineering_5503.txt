Series Capacitors
Series  capacitors  are  employed  to  neutralize  part  of  the  inductive  reactance  of  a  power  circuit,  as  shown  in
Fig. 61.22.  From  the  phasor  diagram  of  Fig. 61.23  we  see  that  the  load  voltage  is  higher  with  the  capacitor
inserted than without the capacitor.
