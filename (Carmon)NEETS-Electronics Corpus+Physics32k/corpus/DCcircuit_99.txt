Knife switches are great for illustrating the basic principle of how a switch works, but they
present distinct safety problems when used in high-power electric circuits. The exposed con-
ductors in a knife switch make accidental contact with the circuit a distinct possibility, and
any sparking that may occur between the moving blade and the stationary contact is free to
ignite any nearby ï¬‚ammable materials. Most modern switch designs have their moving con-
ductors and contact points sealed inside an insulating case in order to mitigate these hazards.
A photograph of a few modern switch types show how the switching mechanisms are much
more concealed than with the knife design:
