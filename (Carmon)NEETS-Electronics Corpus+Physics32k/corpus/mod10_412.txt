The TWISTED PAIR transmission line is illustrated in figure 3-4. As the name implies, the line
consists of two insulated wires twisted together to form a flexible line without the use of spacers. It is not
used for transmitting high frequency because of the high dielectric losses that occur in the rubber
insulation. When the line is wet, the losses increase greatly.
