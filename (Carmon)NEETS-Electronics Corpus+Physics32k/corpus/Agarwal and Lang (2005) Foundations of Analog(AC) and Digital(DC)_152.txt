As better processes become available, VLSI fabrication processes undergo periodic
shrinks to reduce the size of chips without needing significant design changes. The
initially appeared in the 0.25-µm process, and later in the
Pentium III, for example,
0.18-µm process. The Pentium IV chip shown in Figure 1.17 initially appeared in a
0.18-µm process in the year 2000, and later in 0.13-µm and 0.09-µm processes in
2001 and 2004, respectively.
