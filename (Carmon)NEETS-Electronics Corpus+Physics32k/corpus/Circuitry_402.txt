Input resistance 
 
The  input  resistance  of  an  operational  amplifier  is 
defined as the ratio of input voltage to input current 
expressed in ohms. It is often expedient to assume 
that the input of an operational amplifier is purely 
resistive  though  this  is  not  the  case  at  high 
frequencies  where  shunt  capacitive  reactance  may 
become  significant.  The
