You can use an oscilloscope to graphically display the forward- and back-resistance characteristics
of a diode. A test circuit used in conjunction with an oscilloscope is shown in figure 2-7. This circuit uses
an audio-signal generator as the test signal. It should be adjusted for an approximate 2-volt, 60-hertz
signal, as measured across R1.
