Facsimile combines copying with data transmission to produce an image of a subject copy at another location,
either nearby or distant. Although the Latin phrase fac simile means to “make similar,” the compressed phrase
facsimile has been taken to mean “exact copy of a transmission” since 1815 [Quinn, 1989]. The image of the
subject copy is referred to as a facsimile copy, or record copy. Often the abbreviated reference “fax” is used in
place of the longer term facsimile.
