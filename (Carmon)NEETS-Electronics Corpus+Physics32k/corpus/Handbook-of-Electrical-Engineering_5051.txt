generally  deﬁned  as  a  device  which  converts  energy  from  one  form  to  another. A  usable  ouput  refers  to  an
optical, electrical, or mechanical signal. In the context of electrical engineering, however, a usable output refers
to an electrical output signal. The measurand can be a physical, chemical, or biological property or condition
to be measured.
