Conductor ampacity rating is a crude assessment of resistance based on the potential for cur-
rent to create a ﬁre hazard. However, we may come across situations where the voltage drop
created by wire resistance in a circuit poses concerns other than ﬁre avoidance. For instance,
we may be designing a circuit where voltage across a component is critical, and must not fall
below a certain limit. If this is the case, the voltage drops resulting from wire resistance may
cause an engineering problem while being well within safe (ﬁre) limits of ampacity:
