Diffraction Tomography
The X-ray computerized tomography (CT) has been widely
used for medical imaging and diagnosis since the 1970s. The
basic idea of it is that the total attenuation of the X-ray
traversing the object along some direction is related to the
integrated absorption by the object along that direction.
Hence, the attenuation distribution of the transmitted X-ray
forms a Radon transform of the absorption distribution of the
object. The projection–slice theorem is used to collect the data
in the Fourier domain, and then the inverse Fourier transform
is performed (by FFT) to reconstruct the absorption distribu-
tion of the object. Now, if the electromagnetic wave is used to
reconstruct dielectric constant distribution of the object in a
similar manner, the diffraction effect due to ﬁnite wavelength
should be taken into account. It is quite complicated to do in
general. For a weakly inhomogeneous object, however, it is
possible to formulate the diffraction tomography in a manner
similar to CT, and the general solution can be obtained. To be
speciﬁc, here the dielectric object of interest is assumed to be
Y
E in the ﬁrst
weakly inhomogeneous such that the total ﬁeld
part of equation 10.58 can be approximated by the incident
Y
Ei. This is usually referred to as the Born approximation.
