When the magnet and iron bar are separated, the 
domains in the iron bar return to their random pat-
tern, although a few domains remain in northâ€“south 
alignment, giving the iron bar a weak magnetic field. 
This remaining magnetic field is called residual	
magnetism. The ability of a material to retain its 
magnetic field after the magnetizing force is removed 
is called retentivity. Soft iron has low retentivity. 
 Alnico, an alloy made of aluminum, nickel, and cobalt, 
has high retentivity.
