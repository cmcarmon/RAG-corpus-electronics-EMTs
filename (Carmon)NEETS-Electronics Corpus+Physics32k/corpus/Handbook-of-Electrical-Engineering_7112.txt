Proposed Ka-band satellite systems that would operate at the 20- and 30-GHz bands may incorporate inter-
satellite links at Ka-band or even at 60 GHz. These systems are intended to provide broadband voice, video,
and data services for the GII. Systems have been proposed for operation at GEO and LEO.
