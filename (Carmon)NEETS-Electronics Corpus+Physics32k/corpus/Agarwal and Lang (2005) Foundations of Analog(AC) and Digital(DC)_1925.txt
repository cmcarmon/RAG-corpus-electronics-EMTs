The same frequency response can also be sketched easily by making the
following observations about the magnitude and phase plots. Let us first deal
with the magnitude plot. Observe from Figure 13.24 that the magnitude plot
is asymptotic to two straight lines. At low frequencies (ω → 0), the magnitude
becomes
