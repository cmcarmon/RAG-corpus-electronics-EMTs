The TRIAC is a three-terminal device similar in construction and operation to the SCR. The TRIAC 
controls and conducts current flow during both alternations of an ac cycle, instead of only one. The 
schematic symbols for the SCR and the TRIAC are compared in figure 3-23. Both the SCR and the 
TRIAC have a gate lead. However, in the TRIAC the lead on the same side as the gate is "main terminal 
1," and the lead opposite the gate is "main terminal 2." This method of lead labeling is necessary because 
the TRIAC is essentially two SCRs back to back, with a common gate and common terminals. Each 
terminal is, in effect, the anode of one SCR and the cathode of another, and either terminal can receive an 
input. In fact, the functions of a TRIAC can be duplicated by connecting two actual SCRs as shown in 
figure 3-24. The result is a three-terminal device identical to the TRIAC. The common anode-cathode 
connections form main terminals 1 and 2, and the common gate forms terminal 3.
