11.6.2 A two-winding, single-phase transformer rated
3 kVA, 220:110 V, 60 Hz is connected as an
autotransformer to transform a line input voltage
of 330 V to a line output voltage of 110 V and to
deliver a load of 2 kW at 0.8 lagging power factor.
Draw the schematic diagram of the arrangement,
label all the currents and voltages, and calculate
all the quantities involved.
