Near the cruise condition most of the lift force is generated by the wings, with ideally only a small amount generated by the fuselage and tail. We may analyse the longitudinal static stability by considering the aircraft in equilibrium under wing lift, tail force, and weight. The moment equilibrium condition is called trim, and we are generally interested in the longitudinal stability of the aircraft about this trim condition.

Equating forces in the vertical direction:




W

w

L

t




{\displaystyle W=L_{w}+L_{t}}

where W is the weight,




L

w




{\displaystyle L_{w}}
is the wing lift and




L

t




{\displaystyle L_{t}}
is the tail force.
For a thin airfoil at low angle of attack, the wing lift is proportional to the angle of attack:

{\displaystyle L_{w}=qS_{w}{\frac {\partial C_{L}}{\partial \alpha }}(\alpha -\alpha _{0})}

where




S

{\displaystyle S_{w}}

C

L




{\displaystyle C_{L}}
is the (wing) lift coefficient,



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }
is the angle of attack. The term

{\displaystyle \alpha _{0}}
is included to account for camber, which results in lift at zero angle of attack. Finally



q


{\displaystyle q}
is the dynamic pressure:

{\displaystyle q={\frac {1}{2}}\rho v^{2}}

where



ρ
