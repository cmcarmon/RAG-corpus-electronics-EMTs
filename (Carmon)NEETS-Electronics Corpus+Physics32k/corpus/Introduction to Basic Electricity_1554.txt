Electrical grounding is used in automobiles. Here 
the chassis of the automobile is used as a ground. This 
can be verified by seeing where the battery cables are 
attached to the automobile. Generally, the negative ter-
minal is bolted directly to the frame of the automobile. 
This point or any other point on the frame of the au-
tomobile is considered to be ground. Ground serves as 
part of the complete circuit.
