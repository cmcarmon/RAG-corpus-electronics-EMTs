The simple conÔ¨Åguration shown in Figure 16.2.2 is actually the basic building block of a
complex block diagram. The arrows on the diagram imply that the block diagram has a unilateral
property; in other words, a signal can pass only in the direction of the arrows. A box is the
symbol for multiplication; the input quantity is multiplied by the function in the box to obtain the
output. With circles indicating summing points (in an algebraic sense), and with boxes or blocks
denoting multiplication, any linear mathematical expression can be represented by block-diagram
notation, as in Figure 16.2.3 for an elementary feedback control system. The expression for the
output quantity with negative feedback is given by
