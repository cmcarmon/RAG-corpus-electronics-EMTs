The only effect that a variation in voltage will have on meter indication is the degree to
which the measured resistance changes with applied voltage. So, if we were to use a megger
to measure the resistance of a gas-discharge lamp, it would read very high resistance (needle
to the far right of the scale) for low voltages and low resistance (needle moves to the left of the
scale) for high voltages. This is precisely what we expect from a good high-voltage ohmmeter:
to provide accurate indication of subject resistance under different circumstances.
