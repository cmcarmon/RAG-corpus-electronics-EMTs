It follows from the arguments of rate distortion theory that we will do better if we encode long blocks of
source  symbols  rather  than  encoding  each  symbol  individually.  In  this  case,  we  will  consider  a  block  of  n
symbols from the source as a vector-valued random variable, and we will represent these n-dimensional vectors
by a set of 2nR code words. This process is called vector quantization (VQ). We can apply the Lloyd algorithm
to  design  a  set  of  representation  vectors  (the  code  book)  and  the  corresponding  nearest  neighbor  regions.
Instead of using the probability distribution for the source to calculate the centroids of the regions, we can use
the empirical distribution from a training sequence. Many variations of the basic vector quantization algorithm
are described in Gersho and Gray [1992].
