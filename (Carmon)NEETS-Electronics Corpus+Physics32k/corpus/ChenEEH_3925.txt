It may appear, at the ﬁrst sight, that the likelihood function is
nothing but the pdf. It is important, however, to note that the
likelihood function is really a function of the parameter u for a
ﬁxed value of x, whereas the pdf is a function of the realization
of the random variable x for a ﬁxed value of u. Therefore, in a
likelihood function, the variable is u, while in a pdf the variable
is x. The likelihood function is a quantitative indication of how
