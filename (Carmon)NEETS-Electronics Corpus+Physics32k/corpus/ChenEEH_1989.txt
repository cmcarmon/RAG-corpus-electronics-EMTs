During the execution of the program, the lines of the cache will
be ﬁlled successively until a branch in the program ﬂow is
taken. The design technique of Rota (2002) introduces a small
hardware modiﬁcation in the cache system: a counter that
counts the number of accesses by the processor to the cache,
and every K that accesses the accessed instruction is sent to an
FIFO buffer placed in a bus controller that interfaces with the
external memory bus. The WD then performs a derived signa-
ture checking of each block based on the instructions of the
block that it receives.
