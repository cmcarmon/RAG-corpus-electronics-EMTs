an output and then go back to check it for self-consistency. This is given as a problem at the end
of the chapter. Figure 6.1.18 is a realization of an SRFF in terms of a physical circuit that behaves
similarly to the ideal device called SRFF which obeys the SR instruction rules. Thus, note that
the circuit of Figure 6.1.18 cannot accurately be said to be an SRFF. While it is certainly possible
to apply the “forbidden” input (S = 1 and R = 1) to the real circuit, the circuit is then not properly
used as an SRFF.
