Serial Thermal Printing
Thermal  technologies  have  been  used  in  many  low-cost  serial  printer  applications.  There  are  three  basic
approaches: (1) use of a heat-sensitive special paper, (2) thermal transfer of ink from a ribbon to paper, and
(3) a variant on (2) with a special ribbon structure and printhead that improve thermal efﬁciency and allow
printing on a wide range of standard papers (including the relatively rough ofﬁce bond papers).
