The circular waveguide is also very popular due to its simpli-
city in manufacturing and low attenuation of the fundamental
mode. The circular waveguide is made of a cylindrical struc-
ture that maintains a uniform cross section along the length as
illustrated in Figure 5.7. As in the case of a rectangular wave-
guide, the inside of the waveguide is either Ô¨Ålled with air or
with dielectric material.
