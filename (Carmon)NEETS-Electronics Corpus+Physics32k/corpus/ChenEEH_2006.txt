HC and, if the corresponding instruction or data line fetched is
stored in cache. Subsequently, when the instruction is fetched
from cache, it will always be erroneous. If this error is subse-
quently detected by the WD monitoring the cache-processor
bus or the HC on that bus, a microrollback occurs. After the
microrollback occurs, the same instruction (with permanent
errors) will be fetched again, and the microrollback and subse-
quent fetch will repeat ad inﬁnitum. This type of inﬁnite loop
can be detected with high probability if the WD can be aug-
mented to detect the number of microrollbacks of the same
type (e.g., deﬁned by just the microrollback distance) and then
send a signal to the processor to terminate the program when
10 consecutive microrollbacks of the same type are detected.
Such termination is a fail-safe termination of the program as
its results are not deemed reliable.
