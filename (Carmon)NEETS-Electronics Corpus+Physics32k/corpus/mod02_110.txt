 However, since some inductors are designed to carry relatively large amounts of current, 
considerable power can be dissipated in the inductor even though the amount of resistance in the inductor 
is small. This power is wasted power and is called COPPER LOSS. The copper loss of an inductor can be 
calculated by multiplying the square of the current in the inductor by the resistance of the winding (I2R).
