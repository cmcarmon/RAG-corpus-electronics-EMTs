Without refraction, light waves would pass in straight lines through transparent substances without
any change of direction. Figure 2-5 shows that rays striking the glass at any angle other than
perpendicular are refracted. However, perpendicular rays, which enter the glass normal to the surface,
continue through the glass and into the air in a straight lineâ€”no refraction takes place.
