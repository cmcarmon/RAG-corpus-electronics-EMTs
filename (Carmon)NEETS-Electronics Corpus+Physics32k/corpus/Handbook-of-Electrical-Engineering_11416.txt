Cryogenic Detectors
Detectors in this group are limited principally to high-purity germanium (HPGe) and lithium drifted silicon
(Si:Li). HPGe detectors are available in a number of conﬁgurations for operation in the X-ray and gamma-ray
regions. Si:Li detectors are primarily for the X-ray region. Cryogenic detectors provide the ultimate in energy
resolution, as well as good detection efﬁciency. Common to the group is the requirement that they be operated
in the region of 77K. In most cases, the detector temperature is maintained by liquid nitrogen (LN2) contained
in an attached cryogenic vessel (dewar). Dewars are available in capacities ranging from a few liters to several
tens  of  liters,  depending  on  the  service  interval  that  is  acceptable  and  the  degree  of  portability  required.
Alternatively, electromechanical coolers are also available.
