The ideal MHD equations consist of the continuity equation, the Cauchy momentum equation, Ampere's Law neglecting displacement current, and a temperature evolution equation. As with any fluid description to a kinetic system, a closure approximation must be applied to highest moment of the particle distribution equation. This is often accomplished with approximations to the heat flux through a condition of adiabaticity or isothermality.
The main quantities which characterize the electrically conducting fluid are the bulk plasma velocity field v, the current density J, the mass density ρ, and the plasma pressure p. The flowing electric charge in the plasma is the source of a magnetic field B and electric field E. All quantities generally vary with time t. Vector operator notation will be used, in particular ∇ is gradient, ∇⋅ is divergence, and ∇× is curl.

is the ratio of specific heats for an adiabatic equation of state. This energy equation is, of course, only applicable in the absence of shocks or heat conduction as it assumes that the entropy of a fluid element does not change.
