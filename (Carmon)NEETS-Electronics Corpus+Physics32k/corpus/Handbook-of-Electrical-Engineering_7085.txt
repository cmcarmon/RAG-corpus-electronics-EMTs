Data Compression in Practice
The previous subsections discussed the fundamental limits to compression for a stochastic source. We will now
consider the application of these algorithms to some practical sources, namely, text, speech, images, and video.
In real applications, the sources may not be stationary or ergodic, and the distributions underlying the source
are often unknown. Also, in addition to the efÔ¨Åciency of the algorithm, important considerations in practical
applications include the computational speed and memory requirements of the algorithm, the perceptual quality
of the reproductions to a human observer, etc. A considerable amount of research and engineering has gone
into the development of these algorithms, and many issues are only now being explored. We will not go into
the details but simply list some popular algorithms for the different sources.
