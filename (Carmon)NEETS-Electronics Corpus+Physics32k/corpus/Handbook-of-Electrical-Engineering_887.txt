DC (Steady-State) Analysis
DC analysis calculates the state of a circuit with ﬁxed (non-time varying) inputs after an inﬁnite period of time.
DC analysis is useful to determine the operating point (Q-point) of a circuit, power consumption, regulation
and  output  voltage  of  power  supplies,  transfer  functions,  noise  margin  and  fanout  in  logic  gates,  and  many
other types of analysis. In addition DC analysis is used to ﬁnd the starting point for AC and transient analysis.
To perform the analysis the simulator performs the following steps:
