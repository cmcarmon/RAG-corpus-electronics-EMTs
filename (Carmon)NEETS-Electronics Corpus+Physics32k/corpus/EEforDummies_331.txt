To calculate the current flowing through the circuit, you need to determine 
the total resistance that the 9‐volt battery is facing in the circuit. Because the 
resistors are in series, the resistances add up, for a total equivalent  resistance 
of 1.22 kΩ. You use this equivalent resistance to calculate the new current, as 
follows:
