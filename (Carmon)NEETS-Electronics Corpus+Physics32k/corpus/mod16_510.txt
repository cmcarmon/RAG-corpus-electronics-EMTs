The Semiconductor Test Set AN/USM-206A (figure 4-17) is a rugged, field-type tester designed to
test transistors and semiconductor diodes. The set will measure the beta of a transistor, the resistance
appearing at the electrodes, and the reverse current of a transistor or semiconductor diode. It will also
measure a shorted or open condition of a diode, the forward transconductance of a field-effect transistor,
and the condition of its own batteries.
