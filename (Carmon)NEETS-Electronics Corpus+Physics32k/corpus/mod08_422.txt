So a decrease in inductance of 11.3 millihenries (23 mH—11.7 mH) causes an increase in power to
the load (true power) of 625 watts (1125 W—500 W). If it took 1 watt of power to change the inductance
by 11.3 millihenries (by some electrical or mechanical means), figure 3-29 would represent a power
amplifier with a gain of 625.
