Look again at figure 1-38. The sum and difference frequencies are located very near the rf signal 
(100 kilohertz), while the audio signal (5 kilohertz) is spaced a considerable distance away. Because of 
this frequency separation, the audio frequency can be easily removed by filter circuits, leaving just three 
radio frequencies of 95, 100, and 105 kilohertz. These three radio frequencies are radiated through space 
to the receiving station. At the receiver, the process is reversed. The frequency of 95 kilohertz, for 
example, is heterodyned with the frequency of 100 kilohertz and the sum and difference frequencies are 
again produced. (A similar process occurs between the frequencies of 100 and 105 kilohertz.) Of the 
resultant frequencies (95, 100, 105, and 5 kilohertz), all are filtered out except the 5 kilohertz difference 
frequency. This frequency, which is identical to the original 5 kilohertz audio applied at the transmitter, is 
retained and amplified. Thus, the 5 kilohertz audio tone appears  to have been radiated through space 
from the transmitter to the receiver.
