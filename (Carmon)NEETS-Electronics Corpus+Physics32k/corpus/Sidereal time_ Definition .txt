The local apparent sidereal time at a given location is defined as the hour angle of the vernal equinox at that location: it has the same value as the right ascension of any celestial body that is crossing the local meridian at that same moment.
At the moment when the vernal equinox crosses the local meridian, local apparent sidereal time is 00:00. Greenwich apparent sidereal time (GAST) is the hour angle of the vernal equinox at the prime meridian at Greenwich, London.
Local sidereal time at any location differs from the Greenwich sidereal time value of the same moment, by an amount that is proportional to the longitude of the location. When one moves eastward 15° in longitude, sidereal time is larger by one sidereal hour (wrapping around at 24 hours). Unlike the reckoning of local solar time in time zones, incrementing by (usually) one hour, differences in local sidereal time are reckoned based on actual measured longitude, to the accuracy of the measurement of the longitude, not just in whole hours.
Apparent sidereal time (local or at Greenwich) differs from mean sidereal time (for the same location and moment) by the equation of the equinoxes: this is a small difference in right ascension (dRA) parallel to the equator, not exceeding about ±1.2 s, due to nutation, the complex 'nodding' motion of Earth's polar axis of rotation. It corresponds to the current amount of the nutation in (ecliptic) longitude (dψ) and to the current obliquity (ε) of the ecliptic, so that dRA = dψ cos ε.
Greenwich mean sidereal time (GMST) and UT1 differ in rate; the second of sidereal time is a little shorter than that of UT1, so that at 12:00 noon on the first day of the year 2000 1.002737909350795 s of mean sidereal time was equal to 1 s of UT1. The ratio at this second-resolution varies in the tenth decimal place over a century. It is modelled to be approximately 1.002737909409795 in 2100.
To an accuracy of 0.1 s per century, Greenwich (Mean) Sidereal Time (in hours and decimal parts of an hour) can be calculated as
GMST = 18.697374558 + 24.06570982441908 × D,
where D is the interval, in UT1 days including any fraction of a day, since 2000 January 1, at 12:00 UT (interval counted positive if forwards to a later time than the 2000 reference instant), and the result is freed from any integer multiples of 24 hours to reduce it to a value in the range 0–24.
Thus, Greenwich Mean Sidereal Time exceeds mean solar time at Greenwich by a difference equal to the longitude of the fictitious mean Sun used for defining mean solar time (with longitude converted to time as usual at the rate of 1 hour for 15 degrees), plus or minus an offset of 12 hours (because mean solar time is reckoned from 00:00 midnight, instead of the pre-1925 astronomical tradition where 00:00 meant noon).
Sidereal time is used at astronomical observatories because it makes it very easy to work out which astronomical objects will be observable at a given time. Objects are located in the night sky using right ascension and declination relative to the celestial equator (analogous to longitude and latitude on Earth), and when sidereal time is equal to an object's right ascension the object will be at its highest point in the sky, or culmination, at which time it is usually best placed for observation, as atmospheric extinction is minimised.
Sidereal time is a measure of the position of the Earth in its rotation around its axis, or time measured by the apparent diurnal motion of the vernal equinox, which is very close to the motion of stars. They differ by the precession of the vernal equinox in right ascension relative to the stars.
Earth's sidereal day also differs from its rotation period relative to the background stars by the amount of precession in right ascension during one day (8.4 ms). Its J2000 mean value is 23 h 56 min 4.090530833 s.
