Let’s do an example resistance problem for a piece of custom-cut busbar. Suppose we have a
piece of solid aluminum bar, 4 centimeters wide by 3 centimeters tall by 125 centimeters long,
and we wish to ﬁgure the end-to-end resistance along the long dimension (125 cm). First, we
would need to determine the cross-sectional area of the bar:
