â€¢ Thyristor-switched shunt reactors (TCR): In this scheme the fundamental frequency current component
through the reactor is controlled by delaying the closing of the thyristor switch with respect to the natural
zero  crossings  of  the  current.  Figure 61.26(b)  shows  the  concept  of  the  TCR.  Harmonic  currents  are
generated from the phase-angle-controlled reactor.
