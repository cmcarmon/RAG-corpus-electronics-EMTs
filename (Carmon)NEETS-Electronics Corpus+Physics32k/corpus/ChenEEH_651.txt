Mixed radix representations associated with the RNS
numbers can be used to detect overﬂows as well as to detect
and correct errors in redundant RNS systems. For example,
to detect overﬂows, a redundant modulus mNþ1 is added to
the base and the corresponding highest order mixed radix
digit aNþ1 is found and compared to zero. Assuming that the
