For magnetic circuits with ac excitation, the concepts of inductance and energy storage come
into play along with Faradayâ€™s law of induction. Those concepts have been presented in some
detail in Section 1.2. The reader is encouraged to review that section, as that background will be
helpful in solving some of the problems related to this section.
