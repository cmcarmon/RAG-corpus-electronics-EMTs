segment of operation associated with each of the nonlinear devices. This was
not too hard with a single nonlinear device such as an ideal diode, but can be
challenging when there are a number of nonlinear devices. It turns out that
the approach that we discussed in this example generalizes to the method of
assumed states, which will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 16.
