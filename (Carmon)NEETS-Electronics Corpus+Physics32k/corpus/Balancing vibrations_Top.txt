Balancing is a process of correcting or eliminating, either partially or completely, the effects due to inertia forces and couples acting on the machine parts or components. thus purpose of balancing is to avoid the vibration of the machine by balancing the resultant inertia forces and couples.
Vibration can have huge effects on the balancing and efficiency of vehicles and machinery. Over time excessive vibrations can even lead to damage to your vehicle or machinery, resulting in expensive replacement or repair costs. A huge variety of machinery is at risk from long term vibration damage including high speed tooling machines, generators, compressors, fans and electric motors. All kinds of vehicles are also at risk, especially high speed vehicles, where mechanical failure can result in catastrophic injuries. The balancing is highly essential, especially in high speed applications such as electric motors, generators, turbines, pumps, aircraft etc.
