Low-level flying involves air safety hazards such as:
Collision with the ground, electricity wires etc. as a result of pilot error (e.g. Cavalese, 1998) or failure of aircraft systems - at low level and high speed there is little time to react to any problem.
Mid-air collision with light aircraft (e.g. Norfolk, 1974) or other military aircraft.
Bird strike.
The noise can also disturb animals and hence cause a hazard to horse-riders etc.
