Disk terminology. Heads reside on arms which are positioned by actuators. Tracks are concentric rings on
platters. A sector is the basic unit of read/write. A cylinder is a stack of tracks at one actuator position. An HDA is everything
in the Ô¨Ågure plus the air-tight casing. In some devices it is possible to transfer from multiple surfaces simultaneously. The
collection of heads that participate in a single logical transfer that is spread over multiple surfaces is called a head group.
