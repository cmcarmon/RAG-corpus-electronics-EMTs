• Temperature changes in the measured liquid affect both the response of the measurement
electrode to a given pH level (ideally at 59 mV per pH unit), and the actual pH of the
liquid. Temperature measurement devices can be inserted into the liquid, and the signals
from those devices used to compensate for the effect of temperature on pH measurement,
but this will only compensate for the measurement electrode’s mV/pH response, not the
actual pH change of the process liquid!
