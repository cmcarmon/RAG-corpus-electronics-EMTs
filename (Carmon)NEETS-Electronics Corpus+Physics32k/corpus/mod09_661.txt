A schematic diagram of a positive step counter is shown in view (A) of figure 4-45. For step 
counting, the load resistor of the positive-counting circuit is replaced by capacitor C2. This capacitor is 
relatively large in comparison to C1. Each time D2 conducts, the charge on C2 increases as shown in 
view (B). The steps are not the same height each time. They decrease exponentially with time as the 
voltage across C2 approaches the input voltage.
