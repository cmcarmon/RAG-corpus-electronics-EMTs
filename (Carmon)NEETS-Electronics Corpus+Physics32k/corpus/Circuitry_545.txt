facility isnâ€™t available it will be necessary to use an 
external  ADC  which  usually  takes  the  form  of  a 
single integrated circuit. The resolution of the ADC  
will depend upon the number of bits used and 8, 10,  
and  12-bit  devices  are  common 
in  control 
applications. 
 
Output devices 
 
Output  devices 
communicate 
information  or  actions  from  a  computer  system  to 
the  outside  world.  In  a  personal  computer  system, 
the  most  common  output  device  is  the  CRT 
(cathode  ray  tube)  display.  Other  output  devices 
include  printers  and  modems.  As  with 
input 
devices,  microcontroller  systems  often  use  much 
simpler output devices. These may be nothing more 
than  LEDs,  piezoelectric  sounders,  relays  and 
motors.  In  order  to  be  connected  directly  to  the 
output  port  of  a  microcontroller,  an  output  device 
must,  once  again,  be  able  to  accept  a  logic 
compatible signal.
