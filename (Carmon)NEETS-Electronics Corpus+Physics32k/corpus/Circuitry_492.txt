Date codes 
 
It  is  also  worth  noting  that  the  vast  majority  of 
logic  devices  and  other  digital  integrated  circuits 
are  marked  with  a  four  digit  date  code.  The  code 
often appears alongside or below the device code. 
The  first  two  digits  of  this  code  give  the  year  of 
manufacture  while  the  last  two  digits  specify  the 
week of manufacture.
