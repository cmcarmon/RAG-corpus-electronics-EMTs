positions along the annular ring as shown in Figure 7.19(A).
The electrical characteristics of hybrid rings are quite similar to
those of the 90 branch-line hybrids except that the output
ports 2 and 3 have a phase difference of 180 instead of 90.
With reference to Figure 7.19, the design of a 3-dB coupler
requires Z1 Â¼ Z2 Â¼
Z0. Generally, the rat-race hybrid has a
2
broader bandwidth than its branch-line counterpart, but it is
also limited by resonance of the ring or the commensurate line
sections.
