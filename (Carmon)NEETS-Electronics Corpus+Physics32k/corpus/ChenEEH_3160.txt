Whether an insulator fails by surface ﬂashover or a puncture
depends on the magnitude and duration of the electric stress
applied, insulator dimensions, and defects in the material.
Breakdown requires the formation of an ionized channel, and
this channel has to be established within the duration of the
applied voltage. If the insulator is defective, (i.e., has large
voids or impurities), puncture can be caused by extremely
short duration and large magnitude pulses. Lightning surges,
which have a rise time in the microsecond range, do not cause
puncture if the insulator is sound. Similarly, switching surges
normally do not cause puncture. Both lightning and switching
surges can cause ﬂashover if they have adequate magnitude,
even under dry conditions. Longer duration stresses, such as
those imposed by power frequency, do not result in a punc-
ture. A ﬂashover is, however, possible in a wet and contami-
nated environment at
the nominal operating voltage, as
illustrated in Figure 5.3.
