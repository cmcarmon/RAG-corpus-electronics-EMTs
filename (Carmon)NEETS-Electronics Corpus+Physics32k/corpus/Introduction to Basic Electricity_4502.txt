An up窶電own counter can count in either di-
rection through a certain sequence. It is also referred 
to as a bidirectional counter. The counter can be re-
versed at any point in the counting sequence. Its sym-
bol is shown in Figure 44-20. An up窶電own counter 
can consist of any number of stages. Figure 44-21 
shows the logic diagram for a BCD up窶電own coun-
ter. The inputs to the JK flip-flops are enabled by the 
up窶電own input qualifying the up or down set of the 
AND gates.
