This relationship is plotted through 360 degrees of rotation. A continuous line is drawn through the 
successive points and is known as 1 CYCLE of a sine wave. If the time axis were extended for a second 
revolution of the vector plotted, you would see 2 cycles of the sine wave. The 0-degree point of the 
second cycle would be the same point as the 360-degree point of the first cycle.
