The most prominent effects of ionospheric storms are a turbulent ionosphere and very erratic sky 
wave propagation. Critical frequencies are lower than normal, particularly for the F2 layer. Ionospheric 
storms affect the higher F2 layer first, reducing its ion density. Lower layers are not appreciably affected 
by the storms unless the disturbance is great. The practical effect of ionospheric storms is that the range of
