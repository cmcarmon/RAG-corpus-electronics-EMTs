In two’s complement arithmetic, the addition of more than
two numbers will be correct independently of the order in
which they are added even if overﬂow occurs in a partial
summation as long as the overall sum is within the available
range to represent the numbers. As a result, a simpliﬁed scaling
technique can be used where only the multiplier inputs require
scaling. To perform scaling, a multiplier is used at the input of
the ﬁlter section as illustrated in Figure 2.25.
