Although the choice of reference node is in fact arbitrary, it is most con-
venient to choose the node that has the maximum number of circuit elements
connected to it. The potential at this node is defined to be zero V, or ground-zero
potential. In electrical and electronic circuits, this node will usually correspond
to the ‘‘common ground’’ of the system, and is usually connected to the system
chassis. Assigning zero potential to the ground node is permissible because ele-
ments respond only to their branch voltages and not to their absolute terminal
voltages. Thus, an arbitrary constant potential may be uniformly added to all
terminal voltages across the circuit thereby permitting any node to be selected
as ground. A node will have a negative voltage if its potential is lower than that
of the ground node.
