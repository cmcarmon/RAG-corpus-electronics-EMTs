2. FDTD is accurate and robust. The sources of error in
FDTD calculations are well understood and can be
bounded to permit accurate models for a very large
variety of electromagnetic wave interaction problems.
3. FDTD treats impulsive behavior naturally. Being a time-
domain technique, FDTD directly calculates the im-
pulse response of an electromagnetic system. Therefore,
a single FDTD simulation can provide either ultrawide-
band temporal waveforms or the sinusoidal steady-state
response at any frequency in the excitation spectrum.
