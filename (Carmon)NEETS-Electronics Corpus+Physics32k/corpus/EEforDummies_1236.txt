The frequency at which the 555 timer output oscillates depends on the values 
of two resistances and a capacitor, as you see in ChapterÂ 11 and in other proj-
ects in this chapter. Resistor R1 and capacitor C1 are two of the three values 
that go into the frequency calculation. The other value that helps determine 
frequency is the resistance found between pins 7 and 2.
