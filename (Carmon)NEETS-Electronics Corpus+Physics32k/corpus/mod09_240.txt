Let's review what you have studied up to this point concerning feedback. Feedback is the process of 
transferring energy from a high-level point in a system to a low-level point in a system. This means 
transferring energy from the output of an amplifier back to its input. If the output feedback signal opposes 
the input signal, the signal is DEGENERATIVE or NEGATIVE FEEDBACK. However, if the feedback 
aids the input signal, the feedback is REGENERATIVE or POSITIVE FEEDBACK. Regenerative or
