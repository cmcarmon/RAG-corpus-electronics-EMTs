Varistors  in  Parallel.  The  equivalent  k  value  for  a  parallel  combination  of  varistors  can  be  obtained  by
connecting n varistors in parallel and applying a voltage V across the terminals. The current through the varistors
will still be n times the current through a single varistor with a voltage V across it. Mathematically the current
and voltage are related as
