Computer network architecture refers to a set of rules that
allow for connectivity among a large number of computers.
This set of rules is also called communication protocols. To
simplify the complexity of network design, the communication
functions are divided into several levels of abstractions. Each
level or layer of the protocol is designed in such a way that the
change to one layer normally does not affect adjacent layers.
The services of higher layers are implemented to use the
services provided at lower layers. There are two interfaces at
each layer. One is the peer-to-peer protocol between two
computers. The other is the service interface to its adjacent
layers on the same computer. Peer-to-peer protocol between
two computers mostly regards indirect communication, and
the direct communication only occurs at the lowest layer or
hardware level. Each higher layer of protocol adds its own
header information to the data message it receives from its
higher layer of protocol before it passes the data message to its
lower layer. This process is called encapsulation. The receiving
system reverses the process, called decapsulation, by removing
the header at each layer before passing the data message to its
upper layer. Two prevalent network architectures are described
in this section.
