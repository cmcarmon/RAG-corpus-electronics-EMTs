Air-search radar systems are used as early-warning devices because they can detect approaching
enemy aircraft or missiles at great distances. In hostile situations, early detection of the enemy is vital to a
successful defense against attack. Antiaircraft defenses in the form of shipboard guns, missiles, or fighter
planes must be brought to a high degree of readiness in time to repel an attack. Range and bearing
information, provided by air-search radars, used to initially position a fire-control tracking radar on a
target. Another function of the air-search radar system is guiding combat air patrol (CAP) aircraft to a
position suitable to intercept an enemy aircraft. In the case of aircraft control, the guidance information is
obtained by the radar operator and passed to the aircraft by either voice radio or a computer link to the
aircraft.
