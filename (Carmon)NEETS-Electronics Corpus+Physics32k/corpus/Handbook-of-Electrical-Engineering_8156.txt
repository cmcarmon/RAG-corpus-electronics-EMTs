Shadow-mask tubes use a mechanical selection of colors. The thin perforated steel or invar shadow-mask is
welded onto a metallic frame suspended by supports in the tube glass faceplate. This structure is sensitive to
shock and vibration, which may affect the position of the mask in the faceplate and the registration of the beam
on  the  appropriate  phosphor  dots.  These  types  of  CRTs  need  specialized  damping  when  ruggedization  is
required. Another type of shadow-mask CRT, the ï¬‚at tension mask (FTM), is much more resistant to shock
and vibration because of the thin shadow-mask foil tension sealed to the face plate. Suspended weight is minimal
and the CRT can withstand high shock and vibration levels [Taki et al., 1996]. The shadow-mask tube is by far
the most widespread tube for computer and high-resolution monitor displays.
