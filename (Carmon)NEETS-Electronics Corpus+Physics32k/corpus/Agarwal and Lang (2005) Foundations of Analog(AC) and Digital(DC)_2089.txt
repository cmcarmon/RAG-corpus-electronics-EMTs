√
2 smaller than the maximum,
and the phase angles at ω1 and ω2. Calculate the quantity Q2 = ωr/(ω2 − ω1).
e) Now suppose that you have just been given a ‘‘parallel resonant’’ circuit Z, but
you don’t know whether it is of the Z1 form or the Z2 form. Suggest a step-by-
step experimental procedure based on measurements of |Z| and perhaps ∠Z as a
function of frequency to determine the following:
