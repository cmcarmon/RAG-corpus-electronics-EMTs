For convenience, as in the past, we will use the variable s as a substitute for jÏ‰.
Let us first use the impedance method to derive the complex output voltage
amplitude Vo as a function of the input voltage amplitude Vi. We will use the
method of series and parallel simplification from Section 2.4 to do so. Notice
that the voltage Va can be obtained using a voltage-divider relationship between
1/C1s and R1(cid:9)(R2 + 1/C2s). Then, observe that Vo can be obtained from
yet another voltage-divider relationship between R2 and 1/C2s. Accordingly,
we have
