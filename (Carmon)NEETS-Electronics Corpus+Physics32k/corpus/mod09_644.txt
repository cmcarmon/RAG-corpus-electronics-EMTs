At the end of the first 100 microseconds of input, the applied voltage suddenly drops to 0 volts, a 
change of 100 volts. Since the capacitor is not able to respond to so rapid a voltage change, it becomes the 
source of 9.5 volts. This causes a âˆ’9.5 voltage to be felt across the resistor in the first instant of time. The 
sum of the voltage across the two components is now 0 volts.
