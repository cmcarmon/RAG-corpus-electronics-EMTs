Relatively few events require that type of responsiveness. Most events have a deadline, but there continues
to be value in responding to that event even past the deadline. In our airline reservation example, the airline
may  wish  to  respond  to  a  customer  request  within,  say,  10  seconds.  However,  if  the  response  comes  in  11
seconds, there is still value in the response. The value is lessened because the customer has become upset. As
time increases, the customer becomes more and more upset and the value of responding decreases. We illustrate
this in Fig. 96.3.
