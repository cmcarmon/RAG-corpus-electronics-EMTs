If fluid pressures in a soil deposit are uniformly increasing with depth according to

then hydrostatic conditions will prevail and the fluids will not be flowing through the soil.




z

w




{\displaystyle z_{w}}
is the depth below the water table. However, if the water table is sloping or there is a perched water table as indicated in the accompanying sketch, then seepage will occur. For steady state seepage, the seepage velocities are not varying with time. If the water tables are changing levels with time, or if the soil is in the process of consolidation, then steady state conditions do not apply.
