Converters ﬁlled with ionizable gases such as cesium vapor in the interelectrode space yield higher power
densities due to space charge neutralization. Barrier index is a parameter that signiﬁes the closeness to ideal
performance with no space charge effects. As this index is reduced, more applications become feasible.
