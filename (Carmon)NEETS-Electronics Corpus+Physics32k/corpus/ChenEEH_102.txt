Theorem 2.4 (orthogonality relationship): (1) A circuit and
a cutset in a connected graph have an even number of common
edges; and (2) if a circuit and a cutset in a directed graph have
2k common edges, then k of these edges have the same relative
orientation in the circuit and the cutset, and the remaining k
edges have one orientation in the circuit and the opposite
orientation in the cutset.
