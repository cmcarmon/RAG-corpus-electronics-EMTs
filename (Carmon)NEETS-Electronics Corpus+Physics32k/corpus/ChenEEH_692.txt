nearly only DRAMs. In that category, the most important
subclass is becoming the SDRAMs (see previous section). In
that case, the bus protocol
is fully synchronous, but the
internal operation of the DRAM is still partly asynchronous.
For the more conventional DRAMs that also have an asyn-
chronous interface, the internal organization involves special
ﬂags, which signal the completion of a read or write and thus
the ‘‘readiness’’ for a new data and/or address word. In this
case, a distinction has to be made between the address access
delay tAA from the moment when the address changes and
when the actual data are available at the output buffer and
the chip (RAM) access delay tACS from the moment when the
chip select (CS) goes up and the data are available. Ideally,
tACS ¼ tAA, but in practice t ACS is the largest. So special
‘‘tricks’’ have to be applied to approach this ideal.
