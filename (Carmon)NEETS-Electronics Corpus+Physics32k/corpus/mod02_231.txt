THE ELECTROSTATIC FIELDâ€”When a charged body is brought close to another charged body,
the bodies either attract or repel one another. (If the charges are alike they repel; if the charges are opposite
they attract). The field that causes this effect is called the ELECTROSTATIC FIELD. The amount by which
two charges attract or repel each other depends upon the size of the charges and the distance between the
charges. The electrostatic field (force between two charged bodies) may be represented by lines of force
