Below is a list of common piping components and their kinetic energy factor,




e

v




{\displaystyle e_{v}}
.

The kinetic energy factor is used to calculate the configurational head loss, the energy loss to the components of the system. The configurational head loss,




H

L

{\displaystyle H_{Lc}}
, can be calculated using the following equation.
