As illustrated in Fig. 89.1, a keyboard consists of a number of keyswitches whose exact structure is of prime
importance  in  keyboard  design.  The  relevant  characteristics  of  keyswitch  operation  are  life,  actuation  force,
travel  distance,  and  feedback.  Accepted  values  are  shown  in  Table 89.2  for  different  keyswitch  designs.  The
elastomer type is preferred to a limited extent over the other two when the electronic audio feedback is included.
This indicates that some type of audio feedback is desirable. One form of keyswitch design using an elastomer
