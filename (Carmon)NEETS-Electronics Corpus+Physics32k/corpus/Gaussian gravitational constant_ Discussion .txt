Isaac Newton was primarily concerned with the laws of force, that is, what the forces between matter were and how they would cause the planets to orbit as they do. His 1687 formulation of the law of universal gravitation thus included a constant G which was convenient for that investigation—one which quantified the relatively weak gravitational force between masses. Such weak forces were difficult to measure with any accuracy; indeed Henry Cavendish's (indirect) first measurement was published only in 1798, just a few years before Gauss' work.
Gauss developed a method of calculating the orbit of a body from observations and hence needed an accurate and easily derived gravitational constant suitable for Solar System celestial mechanics on an astronomical scale. In formulating it, he specified distance in astronomical units (approximately the radius of Earth's orbit). Orbital period was specified in days, and mass in Solar masses. The result was roughly equal to the mean angular motion of Earth in its orbit around the Sun. In early celestial mechanics, comparative measurements, such as the size of an orbit versus Earth's orbit, or the mass of a body versus the Sun's mass, were easier to make and known more accurately than the same values in standard units—for instance, kilometers or kilograms. For these reasons, k was more appropriate for theoretical work.
