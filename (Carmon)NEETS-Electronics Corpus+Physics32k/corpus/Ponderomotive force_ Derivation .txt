The derivation of the ponderomotive force expression proceeds as follows.
Consider a particle under the action of a non-uniform electric field oscillating at frequency



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }
in the x-direction. The equation of motion is given by:







x
¨



=
g
(
x
)
cos
⁡
(
ω
t
)
,


{\displaystyle {\ddot {x}}=g(x)\cos(\omega t),}

neglecting the effect of the associated oscillating magnetic field.
If the length scale of variation of



g
(
x
)


{\displaystyle g(x)}
is large enough, then the particle trajectory can be divided into a slow time motion and a fast time motion:




x
=

x

0


+

x

1




{\displaystyle x=x_{0}+x_{1}}

where




x

0




{\displaystyle x_{0}}
is the slow drift motion and




x

1




{\displaystyle x_{1}}
represents fast oscillations. Now, let us also assume that




x

1


≪

x

0




{\displaystyle x_{1}\ll x_{0}}
. Under this assumption, we can use Taylor expansion on the force equation about




x

0




{\displaystyle x_{0}}
, to get:

cos

(

)


{\displaystyle {\ddot {x}}_{0}+{\ddot {x}}_{1}=\left[g(x_{0})+x_{1}g'(x_{0})\right]\cos(\omega t)}









x
¨




0


≪




x
¨




1




{\displaystyle {\ddot {x}}_{0}\ll {\ddot {x}}_{1}}
, and because




x

1




{\displaystyle x_{1}}
is small,



g
(

x

0


)
≫

x

1



g
′

(

x

0


)


{\displaystyle g(x_{0})\gg x_{1}g'(x_{0})}
, so








x
¨




1


=
g
(

x

0


)
cos
⁡
(
ω
t
)


{\displaystyle {\ddot {x}}_{1}=g(x_{0})\cos(\omega t)}

On the time scale on which




x

1




{\displaystyle x_{1}}
oscillates,




x

0




{\displaystyle x_{0}}
is essentially a constant. Thus, the above can be integrated to get:





x

x

)


ω

cos
⁡
(
ω
t
)


{\displaystyle x_{1}=-{\frac {g(x_{0})}{\omega ^{2}}}\cos(\omega t)}

Substituting this in the force equation and averaging over the

/

ω


{\displaystyle 2\pi /\omega }
timescale, we get,








x

g

{\displaystyle {\ddot {x}}_{0}=-{\frac {g(x_{0})g'(x_{0})}{2\omega ^{2}}}}

{\displaystyle \Rightarrow {\ddot {x}}_{0}=-{\frac {1}{4\omega ^{2}}}\left.{\frac {d}{dx}}\left[g(x)^{2}\right]\right|_{x=x_{0}}}

Thus, we have obtained an expression for the drift motion of a charged particle under the effect of a non-uniform oscillating field.
