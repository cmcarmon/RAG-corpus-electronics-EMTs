Marie Grice Young boarded the Titanic at Cherbourg with White, traveling in first class. They also brought along some exotic French-bred chickens, intending to keep them at their New York country home. She was the last woman passenger from first class to leave the Titanic.

Historian Jonathan Ned Katz suggested that she was intimately related to her travel partner Ella Holmes White, making her an LGBT passenger aboard Titanic.
