IESP is thematically focused on advances in Earth system science. In this context the Earth system is considered as the sum of the planet´s interacting physical, chemical, biotic and societal processes. The atmosphere, hydroshere and cryosphere are parts of the Earth system as well as the grand natural cycles (carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle, phosphorus cycle and sulfur cycle) including the water cycle. All living organisms, humans included, and their activities are also an integral part of the Earth system. The growing human population is changing the interaction of the system´s components and dynamics. Therefore, one of the most important questions to be addressed by the members of IESP is how to maintain the resilience of the Earth system with respect to the grand living conditions on our planet. Answers presented to decision makers of economic and political institutions and to the general public are extracted from the discurse during workshops following the Dahlem Konferenzen concept (http:// www.fu-berlin.de/sites/dahlemkonferenzen/index.html),
