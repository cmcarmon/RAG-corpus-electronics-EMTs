. Shunt impedances: Finite permeability implies nonzero
core reluctance and requires current to magnetize the core
(i.e., a nonzero mmf). This difference between the pri-
mary and secondary mmfs can be modeled as a shunt
inductance. Hysteresis and eddy currents lead to energy
losses in the core that can be approximately modeled by a
shunt resistor. Saturation is an important nonlinear effect
that results in additional losses and the creation of odd
order harmonics in the current and voltage signals.
Because in steady-state system analysis only the 60-Hz
component of the currents and voltages is considered,
saturation effects are typically ignored.
