At  any  given  time,  the  patient  may  be  connected  to  a  variety  of  devices,  e.g.,  respirator,  blood  pressure
monitor, temporary pacemaker, etc., some of which will invade the body and provide a low resistance pathway
to the heart. It is essential that the device not act as a current source and inject the patient with enough current
to stimulate the heart and cause it to Ô¨Åbrillate. Some bias currents are unavoidable for the system input stage
and recommendations are that these leakage currents be less than 10 mA per device. This not only applies to
the normal setting but if a fault condition arises whereby the patient comes in contact with the high voltage
side of the ac power lines, then the isolation must be adequate to prevent 10 mA of fault current as well. This
mandates that the ECG reference ground not be connected physically to the low side of the ac power line or
