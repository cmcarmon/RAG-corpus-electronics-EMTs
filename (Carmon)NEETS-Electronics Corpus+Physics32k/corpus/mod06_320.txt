We will explain the limitation of transit time by using figure 2-9. In view A, the positive-going
alternation of a uhf ac signal is applied to the grid of a conventional-triode tube. The first positive-going
alternation reduces the negative bias on the grid, and electrons start to move toward the grid. Since the
input is an ultrahigh frequency signal, the majority of the electrons cannot pass the grid before the input
signal progresses to the negative alternation. The electrons that have not yet passed the grid are either
stopped or repelled back toward the cathode. This is shown in view B. Before these electrons can move
very far, the second positive alteration reaches the grid, and causes even more electrons to move from the
cathode (view C). At the same time, the electrons that were repelled from the grid toward the cathode by
the first negative alternation feel the effect of the positive-going grid. These electrons reverse direction
and again move toward the grid. Because these electrons had to first reverse direction, they are now
moving slower than the electrons that are attracted from the cathode by the second positive alteration. The
result is that the electrons from the cathode catch up to the slower moving electrons and the two groups
combine (view C). This action is called BUNCHING.
