Hammerspace (also known as malletspace) is a fan-envisioned extradimensional, instantly accessible storage area in fiction, which is used to explain how animated, comic, and game characters can produce objects out of thin air.
This phenomenon dates back to early Warner Bros.' Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies animated cartoons during the Golden Age of American animation.
