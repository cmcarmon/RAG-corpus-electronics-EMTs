The instantaneous power in the circuit is equal to the product of the applied voltage and current 
through the circuit. When the voltage and current are of the same polarity they are acting together and 
taking power from the source. When the polarities are unlike they are acting in opposition and power is 
being returned to the source. Briefly then, in an ac circuit which contains reactance as well as resistance, 
the apparent power is reduced by the power returned to the source, so that in such a circuit the net power, 
or true power, is always less than the apparent power.
