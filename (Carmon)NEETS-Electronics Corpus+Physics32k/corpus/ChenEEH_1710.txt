Spatial Image Features
Low-level image representation features can be extracted from
keyframes in an effort to efﬁciently model the visual content.
At this level, any of the techniques from representation of
image indexing schemes can be used. The obvious candidates
for feature space are color, texture, and shape. Thus, features
used to represent video data have conventionally been the
same ones used for images, extracted from keyframes of the
video sequence, with additional motion features used to cap-
ture temporal aspects of video data. Nephade et al. (1998) ﬁrst
segmented the video spatiotemporally obtaining regions in
each shot. According to their experiments, each region is
then processed for feature extraction. A linearized HSV histo-
gram is used that has 12 bins per channel as the color feature.
