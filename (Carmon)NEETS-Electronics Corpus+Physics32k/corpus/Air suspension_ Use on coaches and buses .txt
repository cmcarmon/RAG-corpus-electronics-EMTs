The current market of buses have suspension system consisting of either mechanical or air suspension system. Compared to its counterpart, air suspension system has significant benefits. Vehicle height can be maintained at a particular value irrespective of it load by varying the pressure and also standard coaches have a system called ferry lift. This allows the air suspension to be raised above the normal ride height level to originally aid loading and unloading the vehicle on and off ferries due to their steep ramps and risk of grounding out, but can be used on rough ground or on steep crests. Although the ferry lift may be installed on some buses, the Kneel Down facility is more common on public transport buses. This helps reduce the step height for easy ingress of passengers.The Kneel Down facility is also used when using the built in wheel chair ramps. Due to several advantages air suspension has been extensively used in commercial vehicles since 1980.
