The fundamental purpose of the vast majority of the world's electric motors is to electromagnetically induce relative movement in an air gap between a stator and rotor to produce useful torque or linear force.
According to Lorentz force law the force of a winding conductor can be given simply by:





F

=
I

ℓ

×

B





{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =I{\boldsymbol {\ell }}\times \mathbf {B} \,\!}

or more generally, to handle conductors with any geometry:





F

=

J

×

B



{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =\mathbf {J} \times \mathbf {B} }

The most general approaches to calculating the forces in motors use tensors.
