The greater the rate of convergence, the better the mesh quality. It means that the correct solution has been achieved faster. An inferior mesh quality may leave out certain important phenomena such as the boundary layer that occurs in fluid flow. In this case the solution may not converge or the rate of convergence will be impaired.
