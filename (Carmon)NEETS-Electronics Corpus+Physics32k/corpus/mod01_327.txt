A primary cell is one in which the chemical action eats away one of the electrodes, usually the 
negative electrode. When this happens, the electrode must be replaced or the cell must be discarded. In 
the galvanic-type cell, the zinc electrode and the liquid electrolyte are usually replaced when this happens. 
In the case of the dry cell, it is usually cheaper to buy a new cell.
