A magnetic circuit provides a path for magnetic ﬂux, just as an electric circuit provides a path for
electric current. Magnetic circuits are integral parts of transformers, electric machines, and many
other common devices such as doorbells. Analogous to voltage (electric potential difference) in
the electric circuit, in a magnetic circuit we have the magnetomotive force (mmf), or the magnetic
potential difference which produces a magnetic ﬁeld, and which has units of amperes or ampere-
turns. The two sources of mmf in magnetic circuits are the electric current and the permanent
magnet (which stores energy and is capable of maintaining a magnetic ﬁeld with no expenditure
