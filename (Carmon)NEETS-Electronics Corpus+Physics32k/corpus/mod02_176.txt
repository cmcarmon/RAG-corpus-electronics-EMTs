To DISCHARGE a capacitor, the charges on the two plates must be neutralized. This is accomplished
by providing a conducting path between the two plates as shown in figure 3-8(B). With the switch in
position (4) the excess electrons on the negative plate can flow to the positive plate and neutralize its charge.
When the capacitor is discharged, the distorted orbits of the electrons in the dielectric return to their normal
positions and the stored energy is returned to the circuit. It is important for you to note that a capacitor does
not consume power. The energy the capacitor draws from the source is recovered when the capacitor is
discharged.
