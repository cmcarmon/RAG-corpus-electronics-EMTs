Rectiﬁers
This  section  discusses  some  simple   uncontrolled  rectiﬁer 
circuits  that  are  commonly  encountered.  The  term 
uncontrolled  refers to the absence of any control signal necessary to operate the primary switching elements (diodes)
in the rectiﬁer circuit. The discussion of  controlled rectiﬁer circuits, and the controlled switches themselves, is
more appropriate in the context of  power electronics applications [Hoft, 1986]. Rectiﬁers are the fundamental
building block in dc power supplies of all types and in dc power transmission used by some electric utilities.
