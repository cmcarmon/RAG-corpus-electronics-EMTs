Despite the simplicity of the model, it has two highly distinguishable phases â€“ the jammed phase, and the free-flowing phase. For low numbers of cars, the system will usually organize itself to achieve a smooth flow of traffic. In contrast, if there is a high number of cars, the system will become jammed to the extent that no single car will move. Typically, in a square lattice, the transition density is when there are around 32% as many cars as there are possible spaces in the lattice.
