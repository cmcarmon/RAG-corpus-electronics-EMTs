If a force F is applied to a particle for a time interval Δt, the momentum of the particle changes by an amount




Δ
p
=

.


{\displaystyle \Delta p=F\Delta t\,.}

In differential form, this is Newton's second law; the rate of change of the momentum of a particle is proportional to the force F acting on it,




F
=



d

d

.


{\displaystyle F={\frac {dp}{dt}}.}

If the force depends on time, the change in momentum (or impulse J) between times t1 and t2 is

{\displaystyle \Delta p=J=\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}F(t)\,dt\,.}

Impulse is measured in the derived units of the newton second (1 N⋅s = 1 kg⋅m/s) or dyne second (1 dyne⋅s = 1 g⋅m/s)
Under the assumption of constant mass m, it is equivalent to write

{\displaystyle F=m{\frac {dv}{dt}}=ma,}

hence the force is equal to mass times acceleration.
Example: A model airplane of 1 kg accelerates from rest to a velocity of 6 m/s due north in 2 s. The net force required to produce this acceleration is 3 newtons due north. The change in momentum is 6 kg⋅m/s. The rate of change of momentum is 3 (kg⋅m/s)/s = 3 N.
