ﬁrst-come–ﬁrst-served service discipline to the trafﬁc entering the FDDI network, which is remarkable con-
sidering that the LANs being interconnected are geographically dispersed. Interestingly, DQDB concepts have
recently  been  adapted  to  provide  wide-area  communications.  Speciﬁcally,  structures  have  been  deﬁned  for
transmitting DQDB frames over standard DS-1 (1.544 megabits per second [Mb/s]) and DS-3 (6.312 Mb/s)
facilities, and these have been used as the basis for a new service offering called switched multimegabit data
services (SMDS).
