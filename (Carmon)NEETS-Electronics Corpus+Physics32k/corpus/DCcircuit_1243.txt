Capacitors are components designed to take advantage of this phenomenon by placing two
conductive plates (usually metal) in close proximity with each other. There are many different
styles of capacitor construction, each one suited for particular ratings and purposes. For very
small capacitors, two circular plates sandwiching an insulating material will sufﬁce. For larger
capacitor values, the ”plates” may be strips of metal foil, sandwiched around a ﬂexible insu-
lating medium and rolled up for compactness. The highest capacitance values are obtained by
using a microscopic-thickness layer of insulating oxide separating two conductive surfaces. In
any case, though, the general idea is the same: two conductors, separated by an insulator.
