The following table lists current measured masses and mass estimates for all the fermions, using the same scale of measure: millions of electron-volts (MeV). For example, the most accurately known quark mass is of the top quark (t) at 172.7 GeV/c² or 172 700 MeV/c², estimated using the On-shell scheme.
Estimates of the values of quark masses depend on the version of quantum chromodynamics used to describe quark interactions. Quarks are always confined in an envelope of gluons which confer vastly greater mass to the mesons and baryons where quarks occur, so values for quark masses cannot be measured directly. Since their masses are so small compared to the effective mass of the surrounding gluons, slight differences in the calculation make large differences in the masses.
