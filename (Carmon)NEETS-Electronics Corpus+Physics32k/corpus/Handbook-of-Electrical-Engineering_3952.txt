Thus,  a  short  section  (g
d  <<  1)  of  a  short  circuited  (ZL  =  0)  transmission  line  looks  like  an  inductor  and  a
capacitor if it is open circuited (ZL = Â¥). When the line is a half wavelength long, an open circuit is presented
at the input to the line if the other end is short circuited.
