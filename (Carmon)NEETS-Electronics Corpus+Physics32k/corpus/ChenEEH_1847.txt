As said earlier, IpSec provides two protocols to secure trafﬁc
ﬂow. The ﬁrst is the Authenticated Header (AH) whose main
function is to establish the authenticity of the sender to the
receiver. It does not provide data conﬁdentiality. In other
words, AH does not encrypt the payload. It may seem, at
ﬁrst, that authentication without conﬁdentiality might not be
useful in the industry. However, there are many applications
where this does provide a great help. For example, there may
be many situations, such as news reports, where the data may
not be encrypted, but it may be necessary to establish the
authenticity of
the sender. AH provides signiﬁcantly less
overhead as compared to ESP. The second protocol is the
Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP). ESP provides both
authentication and encryption services to the IP packets.
Since every packet is encrypted, ESP puts a larger load on the
processor.
