Closer spacing between elements permits compactness of construction. For this reason an end-fire 
array is preferred to other arrays when high gain or sharp directivity is desired in a confined space. 
However, the close coupling creates certain disadvantages. Radiation resistance is extremely low, 
sometimes as low as 10 ohms, making antenna losses greater. The end-fire array is confined to a single 
frequency. With changes in climatic or atmospheric conditions, the danger of detuning exists.
