Spot welding and arc welding represent two major applications of
industrial  robots.  It  has  been  noted  that  industrial  robot  usage  in
welding  tasks  may  be  as  high  as  40%  [Ross,  1984].  Spot  welding  robots  have  found  wide  use  in  automotive
assembly  lines  and  have  been  found  to  improve  weld  quality  and  provide  more  consistent  welds  and  better
repeatability  of  weld  locations.  Continuous  arc  welding  is  a  more  difﬁcult  application  than  spot  welding.
Welding of dissimilar materials, variations in weld joints, dimensional variations from part to part, irregular
edges,  and  gap  variations  are  some  of  the  difﬁculties  encountered  in  the  continuous  arc  welding  processes.
Typical arc welding processes include gas metal arc welding (GMAW), shielding metal arc welding (SMAW),
i.e.,  the  commonly  known “stick”  welding,  and  submerged  arc  welding  (SAW).  The  most  heavily  employed
