At the scale of Earth's orbit, space debris probability peaks at 718 km and 1475 km have been predicted with scale relativity, which is in agreement with observations at 850 km and 1475 km. Da Rocha and Nottale suggest that the dynamical braking of the Earth's atmosphere may be responsible for the difference between the theoretical prediction and the observational data of the first peak.
