The depletion region does not get larger. The 
combining action tapers off quickly, and the region 
remains small. The size is limited by the opposite 
charges that build up on each side of the junction. 
As the negative charge builds up, it repels further 
electrons and keeps them from crossing the junc-
tion. The positive charge absorbs free electrons and 
aids in holding them back.
