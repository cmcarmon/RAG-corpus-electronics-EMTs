ATM Adaptation Layer
The 
 (AAL) is between the ATM layer and higher layers. Its basic function is the enhanced
adaptation of the services provided by ATM to the requirements of the layers above. In order to minimize the
number of AAL protocols, the service classiﬁcation shown in Fig. 72.3 was deﬁned. This classiﬁcation was made
with respect to timing relation, bit rate, and connection mode.
