A  naive  trial-and-error  approach  to  the  design  of  a  control  system  might  consist  of  constructing  a  controller,
installing it into the system to be controlled, performing tests, and then modifying the controller until satisfactory
performance is achieved. This approach could be dangerous and uneconomical, if not impossible. A more rational
is  a  mathematical  description  of  system
approach  to  control  system  design  uses  mathematical  models. A 
behavior, as inï¬‚uenced by input variables or initial conditions. The model is a stand-in for the actual system during
the control system design stage. It is used to predict performance; to carry out stability, sensitivity, and trade-off
