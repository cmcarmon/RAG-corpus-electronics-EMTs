Prior to the mid-1800s, before the development of electronics and the necessary mathematics, (see Euler), and material science to fully understand pressure vessel design, internal ballistics did not have a lot of detailed objective information. Barrels and actions would simply be built strong enough to survive a known overload (Proof test), and muzzle velocity change could be surmised from the distance the projectile traveled.
In the 1800s test barrels began to be instrumented. Holes were drilled in the barrel, "crusher gauges" using copper pellets were attached, the gun was fired, and the pressure was measured indirectly by how much the copper pellet was deformed. But the measurement only indicated the maximum pressure that was reached at that point in the barrel. By the 1960s, piezoelectric strain gauges were used. They allow instantaneous pressures to be measured and did not need a pressure port drilled into the barrel. More recently, using advanced telemetry and acceleration-hardened sensors, instrumented projectiles were developed that could measure the pressure at the base of the projectile and its acceleration.
