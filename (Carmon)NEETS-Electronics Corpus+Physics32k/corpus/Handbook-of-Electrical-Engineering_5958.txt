Capacitor Motors
Another way to generate a phase angle of current in the auxiliary winding is to include a capacitor in series
with it. The capacitor can be disconnected after starting in a capacitor start motor. Their operation is similar
to that of the resistance split-phase motor, but they have better starting characteristics and are made as large
as 5 hp. Figure 66.20 shows schematically the wiring diagram of the capacitor start motor.
