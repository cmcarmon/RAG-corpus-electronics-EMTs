In fluid dynamics, Landau–Levich flow or the Landau–Levich problem describes the flow created by a moving plate which is pulled out of a liquid surface. Landau–Levich flow finds many applications in thin film coating. The solution to the problem was described by Lev Landau and Veniamin Levich in 1942. The problem assumes that the plate is dragged out of the liquid slowly, so that the three major forces which are in balance are viscous force, the force due to gravity, and the force due to surface tension.
