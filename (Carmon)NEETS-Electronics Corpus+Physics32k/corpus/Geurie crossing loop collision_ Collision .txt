The impact of the two locomotives colliding forced the Garratt into the side of the silo and reared up its boiler section on to its leading water unit. 3817 was derailed and pushed over on to its side. Three carriages of the Mail train were also derailed.
The collision damaged about 60m of track on the main line and loop and the line was not reopened for another 3 days.
