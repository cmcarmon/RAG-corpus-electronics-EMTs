Density of states: The total number of charged carrier states per unit volume.
Fermi levels: The energy level at which there is a 50% probability of Ô¨Ånding a charged carrier.
Mean free path: The distance traveled by the charged carrier between two collisions.
Mobile charge: The charge due to the free electrons and holes.
Quasi-Fermi levels: Energy levels that specify the carrier concentration inside a semiconductor under non-
