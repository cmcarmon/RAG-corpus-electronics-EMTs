The space environment including radiation, thermal, and debris issues are described in Wertz and Larson
[1991], GrifÔ¨Ån and French [1991], and Committee on Space Debris [1995]. The structure must support all the
functional  components  and  withstand  the  rigors  of  the  launch  environment.  The  thermal  subsystem  must
control the radiation of heat to maintain a required operating temperature for critical electronics [Gilmore,
1994].
