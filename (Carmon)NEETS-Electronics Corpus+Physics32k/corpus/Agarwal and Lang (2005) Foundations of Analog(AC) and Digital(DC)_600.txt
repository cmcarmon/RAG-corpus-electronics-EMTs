To solve these expressions graphically, we plot both on the same coor-
dinates and find the point of intersection. Because we are assuming that we
have a graph of the nonlinear function, in this case Figure 4.2, the simplest
course of action is to plot the linear expression, Equation 4.31, on this graph,
as shown in Figure 4.20. The linear constraint of Equation 4.31 is usually called
a ‘‘load line’’ for historical reasons arising from amplifier design (as we will see
in Chapter 7).
Equation 4.31 plots as a straight line of slope −1/R intersecting the vD
axis, (iD = 0) at vD = E. (The negative sign may be a bit distressing, but
does not represent a negative resistance, just the fact that iD and vD are not
associated variables for the resistors.) For the particular values in this circuit, the
graph indicates that iD must be about 5 mA, and vD, about 0.6 V. Once we
know that iD is 5 mA, it immediately follows that
