In a semiconductor crystallite whose size is smaller than twice the size of its exciton Bohr radius, the excitons are squeezed, leading to quantum confinement. The energy levels can then be predicted using the particle in a box model in which the energies of states depend on the length of the box. Comparing the quantum dots size to the Bohr radius of the electron and hole wave functions, 3 regimes can be defined. A 'strong confinement regime' is defined as the quantum dots radius being smaller than both electron and hole Bohr radius, 'weak confinement' is given when the quantum dot is larger than both. For semiconductors in which electron and hole radii are markedly different, an 'intermediate confinement regime' exists, where the quantum dot's radius is larger than the Bohr radius of one charge carrier (typically the hole), but not the other charge carrier.

Band gap energy
The band gap can become smaller in the strong confinement regime as the energy levels split up. The Exciton Bohr radius can be expressed as:

{\displaystyle a_{b}^{*}=\varepsilon _{r}\left({\frac {m}{\mu }}\right)a_{b}}


where ab is the Bohr radius=0.053 nm, m is the mass, μ is the reduced mass, and εr is the size-dependent dielectric constant (Relative permittivity). This results in the increase in the total emission energy (the sum of the energy levels in the smaller band gaps in the strong confinement regime is larger than the energy levels in the band gaps of the original levels in the weak confinement regime) and the emission at various wavelengths. If the size distribution of QDs is not enough peaked, the convolution of multiple emission wavelengths is observed as a continuous spectra.
Confinement energy
The exciton entity can be modeled using the particle in the box. The electron and the hole can be seen as hydrogen in the Bohr model with the hydrogen nucleus replaced by the hole of positive charge and negative electron mass. Then the energy levels of the exciton can be represented as the solution to the particle in a box at the ground level (n = 1) with the mass replaced by the reduced mass. Thus by varying the size of the quantum dot, the confinement energy of the exciton can be controlled.
Bound exciton energy
There is Coulomb attraction between the negatively charged electron and the positively charged hole. The negative energy involved in the attraction is proportional to Rydberg's energy and inversely proportional to square of the size-dependent dielectric constant of the semiconductor. When the size of the semiconductor crystal is smaller than the Exciton Bohr radius, the Coulomb interaction must be modified to fit the situation.
Therefore, the sum of these energies can be represented as:

Although the above equations were derived using simplifying assumptions, they imply that the electronic transitions of the quantum dots will depend on their size. These quantum confinement effects are apparent only below the critical size. Larger particles do not exhibit this effect. This effect of quantum confinement on the quantum dots has been repeatedly verified experimentally and is a key feature of many emerging electronic structures.
The Coulomb interaction between confined carriers can also be studied by numerical means when results unconstrained by asymptotic approximations are pursued.
Besides confinement in all three dimensions (i.e., a quantum dot), other quantum confined semiconductors include:
Quantum wires, which confine electrons or holes in two spatial dimensions and allow free propagation in the third.
Quantum wells, which confine electrons or holes in one dimension and allow free propagation in two dimensions.
