In figure 1-49, the bias on Q1 is established by the voltage divider R1 and R2. With the rf carrier 
input at T1, and no modulating signal, the circuit acts as a standard rf amplifier. When a modulating 
signal is injected through C1, it develops a voltage across R1 that adds to or subtracts from the bias on 
Q1. This change in bias changes the gain of Q1, causing more or less energy to be supplied to the 
collector tank circuit. The tank circuit develops the modulation envelope as the rf frequency and af 
modulating frequency are mixed in the collector circuit. Again, this action is identical to that in the plate 
modulator.
