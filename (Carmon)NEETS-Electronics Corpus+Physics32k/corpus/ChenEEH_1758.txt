The H.263 standard is aimed at video communications over POTS and wireless networks at very low data rates (as low as 18 to
64 Kbps). Improvements in this standard are due to the incorporation of several features such as half-pixel motion estimation,
overlapping and variable block sizes, bidirectional temporal prediction, and improved variable length coding options.
