Transformation in three-phase systems can be accomplished in either of two ways: (1)
connecting three identical single-phase transformers to form a three-phase bank (each one will
carry one-third of the total three-phase load under balanced conditions); or (2) a three-phase
transformer manufactured for a given rating. A three-phase transformer, compared to a bank of
three single-phase transformers, for a given rating will weigh less, cost less, require less ﬂoor
space, and have somewhat higher efﬁciency.
