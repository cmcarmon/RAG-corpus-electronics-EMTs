Multirotor type Unmanned Aerial Vehicles exist in numerous configurations including tricopter, quadcopter, hexacopter and octocopter. All of them can be upgraded to coaxial configuration in order to bring more stability and flight time while allowing carrying much more payload without gaining too much weight. Indeed, coaxial multirotors are made by having each arm carrying two motors facing in opposite directions (one up and one down). Therefore, it is possible to have an octorotor looking like a quadcopter thanks to coaxial configuration. Having more lifting power for a greater payload explains why coaxial multirotors are preferred for all professional commercial application of UAS.
