Limit Cycles and Stability
To investigate the possibility of limit cycles in the autonomous closed loop system of Fig. 100.42, the input to
the nonlinearity n(x) is assumed to be a sinusoid so that it can be replaced by the amplitude-dependent DF
gain N(a). The open loop gain to a sinusoid is thus N(a)G(jw) and, therefore, a limit cycle exists if
