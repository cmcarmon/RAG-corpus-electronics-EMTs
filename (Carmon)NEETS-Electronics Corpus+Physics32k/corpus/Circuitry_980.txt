(e)   the equation for the voltage. 
 
All of the above can be obtained from the graph of 
Fig. A8.19, as follows: 
 
(a)   period,  T = 20  ms  (this  is  the  time  for  one 
 
(b)   at t = 5 ms, v = 20 V; at t = 35 ms, v = R20 V 
(c)   vmax = +20 V and vmin = R20 V 
(d)   vav. = 0 V (the positive and negative cycles of
 
(e)   v = 20 sin 314 t
