It had been postulated that neutron star collisions are the main source of r-process elements. In 2017 strong evidence for this theory emerged, when LIGO, VIRGO, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and INTEGRAL, along with a collaboration of many observatories around the world, detected both gravitational and electromagnetic signatures of a likely neutron star collision, GW170817, and detected signals of heavy elements like gold.
