If the number is a whole number, the MSD is the nonzero digit farthest to the left of the radix point
and the LSD is the digit immediately to the left of the radix point. Conversely, if the number is a fraction
only, the nonzero digit closest to the radix point is the MSD and the LSD is the nonzero digit farthest to
the right of the radix point.
