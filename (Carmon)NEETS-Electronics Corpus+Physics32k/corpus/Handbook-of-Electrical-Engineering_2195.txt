To illustrate the use of MATLAB in computing some of the steps mentioned above, we use a speech signal
collected at 8 kHz. After loading the signal from a data Ô¨Åle, we will remove any linear trend that might have
been introduced in the collection process (this also removes any constant term). Figure 21.1 contains a plot of
the signal which clearly shows the time-varying nature of the signal. Figure 21.2 contains a histogram of the
distribution of the values, showing that the values are closer to a Laplacian or Gamma distribution than to a
uniform or Gaussian distribution. Figure 21.3 contains a spectogram which displays the frequency content of
the signal computed using short overlapping time windows. The MATLAB code that generated these plots is
shown in Fig. 21.4. This code illustrates some of the important characteristics of high-level computational tools.
The fundamental data structure is a matrix, and all operations and functions are designed to work with matrices.
Hence, loops are rarely necessary, and thus the code is generally much shorter, more readable, and more self-
documenting.
