Computer simulations can, of course, never replace a skilled engineer, although they can be a tremendous
help  in  both  the  design  and  analysis  process.  The  most  powerful  simulation  program  cannot  solve  all  the
problems  that  arise,  and  the  process  of  making  trade-off  decisions  will  always  be  based  on  experience.  In
addition, evaluating and interpreting the results of a complex simulation require considerable skill and insight.
While these remarks seem obvious, as computer-aided techniques become more powerful, one is tempted to
replace experience and insight with computing power.
