Let's review polarization briefly. In chapter 2 you learned that the radiation field is composed of 
electric and magnetic lines of force. These lines of force are always at right angles to each other. Their 
intensities rise and fall together, reaching their maximums 90 degrees apart. The electric field determines 
the direction of polarization of the wave. In a vertically polarized wave, the electric lines of force lie in a 
vertical direction. In a horizontally polarized wave, the electric lines of force lie in a horizontal direction. 
Circular polarization has the electric lines of force rotating through 360 degrees with every cycle of rf 
energy.
