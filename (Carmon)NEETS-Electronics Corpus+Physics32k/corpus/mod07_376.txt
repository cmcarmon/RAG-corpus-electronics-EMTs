The TUNNEL DIODE is a heavily doped PN junction that exhibits negative resistance over part of 
its range of operation, as can be seen in the curve in the illustration. The heavy doping causes the tunnel 
diode to have a very narrow depletion region and also causes the valence band of one of the 
semiconductor materials to overlap the energy level of the conduction band of the other semiconductor 
material. At the energy overlap point, electrons can cross from the valence band of one material to the 
conduction band of the other material without acquiring any additional energy. This action is called 
tunneling. Tunnel diodes are used as amplifiers, oscillators, and high-speed switching devices.
