hear the same frequency sound produced by the source. This is because the receiver is receiving the same
number of waves per second that the source is producing. Now, if either the source or the receiver or both
move toward the other, the receiver will perceive a higher frequency sound. This is because the receiver
will receive a greater number of sound waves per second and interpret the greater number of waves as a
higher frequency sound. Conversely, if the source and the receiver are moving apart, the receiver will
receive a smaller number of sound waves per second and will perceive a lower frequency sound. In both
cases, the frequency of the sound produced by the source will have remained constant.
