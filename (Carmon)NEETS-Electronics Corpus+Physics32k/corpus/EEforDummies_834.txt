▶✓ Infrared temperature sensor: This sensor 
measures the infrared light given off by an 
object. You use it when your sensor must 
be located at a certain distance from the 
object you plan to measure. For example, 
you use this sensor if a corrosive gas sur­
rounds the object. Industrial plants and sci­
entific labs typically use thermocouples and 
infrared temperature sensors.
