is essentially constant. The rotor mmf Fr determined by the direct ﬁeld current is also a constant
under normal operating conditions. So, as seen from Equation (13.1.3), any variation in the torque
requirements of the load has to be accounted for entirely by variation of the angle δr, which is
why δr is known as the torque angle (or load angle) of a synchronous machine. The effect of
salient poles on the torque-angle characteristic is discussed in Section 13.3.
