Changes in input signal strength occur when we change stations or when we experience fading because of
changing atmospheric conditions. The function of an AUTOMATIC GAIN CONTROL, also referred to
as an AUTOMATIC VOLUME CONTROL, is to limit unwanted variations in the output of the receiver
caused by variations in strength of the received signal input. A receiver without agc would require
continuous manual readjustment to compensate for received signal changes so that it could maintain a
constant output level.
