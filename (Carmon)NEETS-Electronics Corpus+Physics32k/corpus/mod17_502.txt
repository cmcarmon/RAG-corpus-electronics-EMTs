Early communications satellites were severely limited by the lack of suitable power sources. This 
severely limited the output power of the satellite transmitter. The only source of power available within 
early weight restrictions was a very inefficient panel of solar cells without battery backup. A major 
disadvantage of this type of power source is that the satellite has no power when it is in ECLIPSE (not in 
view of the sun). For continuous communications, this outage is unacceptable.
