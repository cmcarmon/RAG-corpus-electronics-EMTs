For simplicity, assume the voltage from source vS is a square wave. Assume that at t = 0,
vO = 0, that is, the circuit is at rest. Now assuming that R is small enough to make
the circuit time constant much smaller than t1 or t2, calculate the voltage waveforms for
each half cycle of the input wave. Find the average value of the output voltage vO for
t1 = t2. Sketch the waveforms carefully. For this choice of R, it should be clear that no
useful smoothing has been accomplished.

For R much larger than the value used in Problem 10.10, so
that the circuit time constant is much larger than t1 or t2, (so that the exponentials can be
approximated by straight lines) calculate vO for the first half cycle of vS, and the second
half cycle. Sketch the result. Note that the solution does not return to the initial point
of vO = 0 after one cycle, so is not in the ‘‘steady state’’ yet.
