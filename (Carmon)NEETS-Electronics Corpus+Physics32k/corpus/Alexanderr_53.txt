If you are looking at a plot of voltage versus resistance or current
versus resistance or power versus resistance, what do you actually see?
Does  the  curve  make  sense?  Does  it  agree  with  what  the  theory  tells
you? Does it differ from expectation, and, if so, why? Clearly, practice
with analyzing and interpreting data will enhance this skill.
