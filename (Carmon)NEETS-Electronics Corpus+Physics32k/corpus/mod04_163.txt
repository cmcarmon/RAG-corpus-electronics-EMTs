The gun or iron should always be kept tinned to permit proper heat transfer to the connection to be 
soldered. Tinning also helps control the heat to prevent solder buildup on the tip. This control reduces the 
chance of the solder spilling over to nearby components and causing short circuits. Maintaining the proper 
tinning on the iron or gun, however, may be made easier by tinning with silver solder (a composition of 
silver, copper, and zinc). The temperature at which the bond is formed between the copper tip and the 
silver solder is much higher than with lead-tin solder. This tends to decrease the pitting action of the 
solder on the copper tip.
