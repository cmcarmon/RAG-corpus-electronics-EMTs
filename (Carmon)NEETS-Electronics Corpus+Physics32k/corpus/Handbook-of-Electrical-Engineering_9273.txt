One of the critical tasks of post-release defect removal is the retroactive calculation of defect removal efﬁciency
levels after software has been in use for one year. For a software project of some nominal size, such as 1000
Function Points, assume that 2000 bugs or defects were found via inspections and tests prior to release. The
ﬁrst year total of user-reported defects might be 50. Dividing the pre-release defect total (2000) by the sum of
all defects (2050) indicates a provisional defect removal efﬁciency of 97.56%.
