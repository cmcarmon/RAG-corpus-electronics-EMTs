2. The half-bridge. In the half-bridge conﬁguration (Fig. 30.26) center-tapped dc source is created by two
smoothing capacitors (Cin), and this conﬁguration utilizes the transformer core efﬁciently. The voltage
across  each  transistor  is  equal  to  the  supply  voltage  (half  of  push-pull)  and,  therefore,  is  suitable  for
high-voltage inputs. One salient feature of this conﬁguration is that the input ﬁlter capacitors can be
used to change between 110/220-V mains as selectable inputs to the supply.
