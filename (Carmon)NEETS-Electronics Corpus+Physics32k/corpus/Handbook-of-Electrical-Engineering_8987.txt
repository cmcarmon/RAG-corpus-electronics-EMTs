Mouse: An input device based on a much older type known as a trackball and fancifully named because it
bears only a casual resemblance to a mouse. It consists of a roller ball that is moved on a ﬂat surface and
causes orthogonal potentiometers or other types of X–Y-position signal generators to move and produce
electrical signals deﬁning the desired coordinates of the cursor on the screen so that the cursor can be
moved to that position.
