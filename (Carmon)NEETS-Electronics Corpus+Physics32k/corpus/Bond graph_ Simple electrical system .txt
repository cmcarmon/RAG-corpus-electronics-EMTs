A simple electrical circuit consisting of a voltage source, resistor, and capacitor in series.

The first step is to draw 0-junctions at all of the node. The result is shown below.

The next step is to add all of the elements acting at their own 1-junction. The result is below.

The next step is to pick a ground. The ground is simply an 0-junction that is going to be assumed to have no voltage. For this case, the ground will be chosen to be the lower left 0-junction, that is underlined above. The next step is to draw all of the arrows for the bond graph. The arrows on junctions should point towards ground (following a similar path to current). For resistance, inertance, and compliance elements, the arrows always point towards the elements. The result of drawing the arrows can be seen below, with the 0-junction marked with a star as the ground.

Now that we have the Bond graph, we can start the process of simplifying it. The first step is to remove all the ground nodes. Both of the bottom 0-junctions can be removed, because they are both grounded. The result is shown below.

Next, the junctions with less than three bonds can be removed. This is because flow and effort pass through these junctions without be modified, so they can be removed to allow us to draw less. The result can be seen below.

The final step is to apply causality to the bond graph. Applying causality was explained above. The final bond graph is shown below.
