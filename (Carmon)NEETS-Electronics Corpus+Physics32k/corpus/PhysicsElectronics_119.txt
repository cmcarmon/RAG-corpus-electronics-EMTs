We now consider circuits where the currents and voltages may vary with time (V = V (t),
I = I(t) (also Q = Q(t))). These lectures will concentrate on the special case in which the
signals are periodic, with time average values of zero ((cid:10)v(t)(cid:11) = (cid:10)i(t)(cid:11) = 0). Circuits with
these signals are referred to as alternating current (AC) circuits. In general signals will have
both DC and AC properties (v(t) = VAC(t) + VDC). We will concentrate only on the AC
components and assume that the DC properties can be treated separately using the methods
of the previous lectures.
