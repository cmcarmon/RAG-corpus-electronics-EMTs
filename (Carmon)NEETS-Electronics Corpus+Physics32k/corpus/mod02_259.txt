When the current flowing through an inductor continuously reverses itself, as in the case of an ac 
source, the inertia effect of the cemf is greater than with dc. The greater the amount of inductance (L), the 
greater the opposition from this inertia effect.  Also, the faster the reversal of current, the greater this 
inertial opposition. This opposing force which an inductor presents to the FLOW of alternating current 
cannot be called resistance, since it is not the result of friction within a conductor. The name given to it is 
INDUCTIVE REACTANCE because it is the "reaction" of the inductor to the changing value of 
alternating current. Inductive reactance is measured in ohms and its symbol is XL.
