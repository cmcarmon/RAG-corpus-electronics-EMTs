The rectiﬁed signal is now a combination of an AC signal and a DC component. Generally,
it is the DC part of a rectiﬁed signal that is of interest, and the un-welcomed AC component
is described as ripple. It is desirable to move the ripple to high frequencies where it is easier
to remove by a low-pass ﬁlter.
