For	the	creation	of	a	circuit,	you	can	make	use	of	just	about	any	tool	you	come
across;	if	you	find	equipment	that	will	make	you	accomplish	a	task	easier,	then,
maybe	you	should	put	it	in	your	arsenal.	You	can	use	just	any	tool,	yes,	but,	doing
so	is	not	advised.	It	is	best	to	choose	the	right	set	(i.e.	a	set	of	tools	with	a	non-
conductive	handle)	to	not	put	your	safety	at	risk.
Common	tools:
Crimper
Cutters	(e.g.	cable	cutter,	electrical	cutter,	etc.)
Extraction	tool
Glue	gun
Non-metallic	tweezers
Pliers
Screwdriver
Soldering	gun
Wire-wrapping	tools
