In a system identiﬁcation problem, one is normally asked to
identify the mathematical input/output relation S from input/
output data. In theory, this is straightforward if the system is
truly linear (Chang, 1973), but in practice this may be difﬁcult
due to noisy data and ﬁnite precision arithmetic. The non-
linear case is difﬁcult in general because series approximations
must be made that may not converge rapidly enough for large
signal modeling (Bello et al., 1973). In both linear and non-
linear identiﬁcation techniques, random inputs are commonly
used as probes (Bello et al., 1973; Cooper and McGillem, 1971;
Lee and Schetzen, 1961). The identiﬁcation of S is then carried
out by mathematical operations on the system input and
output autocorrelations and the cross-autocorrelations be-
tween input and output.
