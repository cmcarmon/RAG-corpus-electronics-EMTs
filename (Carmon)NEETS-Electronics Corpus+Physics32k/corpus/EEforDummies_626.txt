you choose values of supply voltages and resistors so that the base‐
emitter junction is either nonconducting (the voltage across it is less 
than 0.7 V) or fully conducting — with nothing in between. When the 
base‐emitter junction is nonconducting, the transistor is in cutoff mode 
and the switch is off. When the base‐emitter junction is fully conducting, 
the transistor is in saturation mode and the switch is on.
