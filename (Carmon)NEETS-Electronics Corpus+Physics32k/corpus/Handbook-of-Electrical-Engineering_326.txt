In any electrical network which carries direct or alternating current, the
maximum possible power transferred from one section to another occurs when the impedance of the
section acting as the load is the complex conjugate of the impedance of the section that acts as the source.
Here, both impedances are measured across the pair of terminals in which the power is transferred with
the other part of the network disconnected.
