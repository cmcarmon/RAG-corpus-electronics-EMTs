SKEW is the time difference in microseconds between the tracks on a multi-tracked tape recorder.
Fixed or dynamic skew can happen when one of the tracks on the multi-track head leads or lags the track
next to it. Fixed skew errors only show up when you record on one recorder and reproduce on a different
recorder. You can minimize fixed skew by adjusting the recorderâ€™s electronics and aligning the heads.
Dynamic skew errors are caused by worn or sticking tape transport guides or by warped magnetic tape.
