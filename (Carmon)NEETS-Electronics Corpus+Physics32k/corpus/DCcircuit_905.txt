Wiring requirements for pH electrodes tend to be even more severe than thermocouple
wiring, demanding very clean connections and short distances of wire (10 yards or less, even
with gold-plated contacts and shielded cable) for accurate and reliable measurement. As with
thermocouples, however, the disadvantages of electrode pH measurement are offset by the
advantages: good accuracy and relative technical simplicity.
