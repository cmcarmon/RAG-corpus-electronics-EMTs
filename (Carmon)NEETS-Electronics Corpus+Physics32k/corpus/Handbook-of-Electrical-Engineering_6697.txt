All three of the access methods mentioned above became IEEE standards (IEEE 802) and eventually became
ISO  standards  (ISO  8802  series)  because  all  merited  standardization.  On  the  other  hand,  all  existed  for  the
express purpose of exchanging information among peers, and it was recognized at the outset that the upper
end of the data link layer could be shared by all three access techniques. On the other hand, the lower-level
functions  of  the  layer  deal  with  interfacing  to  the  physical  media.  Here,  drastic  differences  in  the  way  the
protocol  had  to  interface  with  the  media  were  recognized.  Thus,  a  different  media-access  control  sublayer
(MAC) was needed for each of the access techniques.
