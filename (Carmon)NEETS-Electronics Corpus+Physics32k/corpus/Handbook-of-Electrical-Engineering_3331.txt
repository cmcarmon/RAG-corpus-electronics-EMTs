Vidicon Camera Tube
A simple TV camera tube is the vidicon. This is the type used in camcorders and for many video applications
where a rugged, simple, and inexpensive camera is required. Figure 31.16 is a schematic of a vidicon tube; the
optical image is formed on the surface of a large-area photoconductor, causing corresponding variations in the
conductivity. This causes the rear surface to charge toward the bias voltage Vb in relation to the conductivity
image. The scanning electron beam periodically recharges the rear side to 0 V, resulting in a recharging current
ï¬‚ow in the output. The output signal is a current signal proportional to the light incident at the position of
the scanning electron beam.
