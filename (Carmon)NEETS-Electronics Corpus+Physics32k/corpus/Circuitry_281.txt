For  each  transistor,  record  your  results  in  a  table 
showing  corresponding  values  of  IC and  IB (see 
Table 5.14). Plot graphs showing IC plotted against 
IB (see  Fig.  5.39).  Calculate  the  value  of  hFE  for 
each  transistor  at  IC = 2 mA.  Compare  your 
calculated  results  and  characteristic  graphs  with 
manufacturerâ€™s data.
