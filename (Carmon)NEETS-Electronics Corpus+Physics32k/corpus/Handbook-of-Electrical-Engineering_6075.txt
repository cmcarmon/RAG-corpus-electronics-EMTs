Initially, transient stability programs all ran in the time domain. A set of differential equations is developed
to describe the dynamic behavior of the synchronous machines. These are linked together by algebraic equations
for the network and any other part of the system that has a very fast response, i.e., an insigniﬁcant time constant,
relative to the synchronous machines. All the machine equations are written in the direct and quadrature axes
of the rotor so that they are constant regardless of the rotor position. The network is written in the real and
imaginary axes similar to that used by the load ﬂow and faults programs. The transposition between these axes
only  requires  knowledge  of  the  rotor  angle  relative  to  the  synchronously  rotating  frame  of  reference  of  the
network.
