Just as important as positional notation is the use of the zero. The placement of the zero in a number
can have quite an effect on the value being represented. Sometimes a position in a number does not have a
value between 1 and 9. Consider how this would affect your next paycheck. If you were expecting a
check for $605.47, you wouldnâ€™t want it to be $65.47. Leaving out the zero in this case means a difference
of $540.00. In the number 605.47, the zero indicates that there are no tens. If you place this value on a bar
graph, you will see that there are no multiples of 101.
