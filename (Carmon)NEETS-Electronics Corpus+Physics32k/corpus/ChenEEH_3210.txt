In a broad deﬁnition, the distribution system is the part of the
electric utility system between the bulk power source and the
consumers’ service switches. It includes a subtransmission
system; distribution substations; primary distribution feeders;
distribution transformers; secondary circuits,
including the
services to the consumer (called service drops); and appropri-
ate protective and control equipment. Some distribution en-
gineers, however, deﬁne the distribution system as that part of
the power system between the distribution substations and the
consumers’ service entrance. Figure 6.1 shows a one-line dia-
gram of a typical distribution system.
