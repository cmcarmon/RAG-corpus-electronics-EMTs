To permit tests to be made interchangeably at all ranges, it was necessary to standardize types of telemeters
at the ranges. To this end the Department of Defense Research and Development Board formed the Guided
Missiles Committee, which in turn formed the Working Group on Telemetry. This later became the Inter-Range
Instrumentation Group (IRIG), which has published telemetry standards that are widely accepted.
