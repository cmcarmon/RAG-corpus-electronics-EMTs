Spectral efÔ¨Åciency is a function of the modulation system used. Among the modulation formats that have
been proposed for DAB transmission are QPSK, M-ary QAM, and MSK [Springer, 1992]. Using these and other
formats,  digital  transmission  systems  that  use  no  more  spectrum  than  their  analog  counterparts  have  been
designed.
