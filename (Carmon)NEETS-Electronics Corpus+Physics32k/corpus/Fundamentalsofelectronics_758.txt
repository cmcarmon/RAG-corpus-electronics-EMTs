A related transmission line is the optic ﬁber. Here, the electromagnetic ﬁeld is light, and it propagates
down a cylinder of glass. In this situation, we don’t have two conductors—in fact we have none—and the
energy is propagating in what corresponds to the dielectric material of the coaxial cable. Optic ﬁber com-
munication has exactly the same properties as other transmission lines: Signal strength decays exponentially
according to the ﬁber’s space constant and propagates at some speed less than light would in free space.
From the encompassing view of Maxwell’s equations, the only diﬀerence is the electromagnetic signal’s fre-
quency. Because no electric conductors are present and the ﬁber is protected by an opaque “insulator,” optic
ﬁber transmission is interference-free.
