The ARC EXTINGUISHER confines, divides, and extinguishes the arc drawn between contacts each
time the circuit breaker interrupts current. The arc extinguisher is actually a series of contacts that open
gradually, dividing the arc and making it easier to confine and extinguish. This is shown in figure 2-18.
Arc extinguishers are generally used in circuit breakers that control a large amount of power, such as
those found in power distribution panels. Small power circuit breakers (such as those found in lighting
panels) may not have arc extinguishers.
