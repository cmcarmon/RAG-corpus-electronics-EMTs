The desired traces are printed onto the copper with 
a material called resist. The board is then placed in a 
chemical tray with a chemical for etching, referred to 
as an etchant, to remove the copper not covered by 
the resist, as shown in Figure 48-4. The etchants of-
ten used for etching small quantities of printed circuit 
boards are either ferric chloride or ammonium persul-
fate. A major concern with etchants is disposal accord-
ing to current environmental standards.
