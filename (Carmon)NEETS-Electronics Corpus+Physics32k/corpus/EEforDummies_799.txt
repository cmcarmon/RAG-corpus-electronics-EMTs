battery. Most generate a nominal 3.7 volts and a maximum 4.2 
volts, and all require a special charger (an NiMH charger will not 
work). Although some models look like your run‐of‐the‐mill AA or 
AAA batteries, Li‐ion batteries use a different naming convention 
(for instance, a 14500 Li‐ion battery is the same size as an AA bat-
tery). If you choose to use Li‐ion batteries, bear in mind the voltage 
differences between these batteries and conventional cells. (For 
instance, two Li‐ion batteries in series generate 7.4 V while two AA 
batteries in series generate 3.0 V.)
