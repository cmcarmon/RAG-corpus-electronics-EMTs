The breakdown voltage, or zener voltage (EZ), is 
 determined by the resistivity of the diode. This, in 
turn, is controlled by the doping technique used  during 
 manufacturing. The rated breakdown  voltage  represents 
the reverse voltage at the zener	test		current	(iZt). The 
zener test current is somewhat less than the maximum 
reverse current the diode can  handle. The breakdown 
voltage is typically rated with 1% to 20% tolerance.
