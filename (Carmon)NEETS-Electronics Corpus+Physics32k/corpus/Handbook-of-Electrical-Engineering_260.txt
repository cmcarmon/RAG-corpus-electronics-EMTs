Consequently, a set of linear, algebraic equations describe the phasors of the currents and voltages in a circuit
in the sinusoidal steady state, i.e., the notion of time is suppressed (see Section 3.2). The solution of the set of
equations  yields  the  phasor  of  each  voltage  and  current  in  the  circuit,  from  which  the  actual  time-domain
expressions can be extracted.
