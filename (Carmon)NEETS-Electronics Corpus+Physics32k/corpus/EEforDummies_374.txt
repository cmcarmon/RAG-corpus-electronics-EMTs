Remember that the negative terminal of a battery has a surplus of electrons. 
So in the circuit shown in Figure 7‐2, the surplus electrons begin to move 
away from the battery toward one side of the capacitor. After they reach the 
capacitor, they’re stopped in their tracks, with no conductive path to follow 
across the capacitor. The result is an excess of electrons on that plate.
