Any further increase in the prime-mover input to the generator causes the real power output to
decrease. The excess power goes into accelerating the generator, thereby increasing its speed
and causing it to pull out of synchronism. Hence, the steady-state stability limit is reached when
δ = π/2. For normal steady operating conditions, the power angle or torque angle is well below
90°. The maximum torque or pull-out torque per phase that a round-rotor synchronous motor can
develop for a gradually applied load is
