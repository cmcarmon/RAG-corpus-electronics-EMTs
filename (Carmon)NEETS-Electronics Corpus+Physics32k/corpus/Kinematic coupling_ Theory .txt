The reproducible and precision of a kinematic coupling comes from the idea of Exact Constraint Design. The principle of Exact Constrain Design is the number of points of constraint should be equal to the number of degrees of freedom to be constrained. In a mechanical system there are six potential degrees of freedom. There are three linear degrees of freedom, the "x", "y", and "z" axis, and three rotational degrees of freedom around each axis commonly called pitch, roll and yaw. If a system is under constrained then the two parts are free to move in one of the degrees of freedom. if the system is over constrained it can cause the system to break down under deformation, extra care needs to be taken when designing an over constrained system. Kinematic coupling designs only make contact with the number of points equal to the number of degrees of freedom that are to be restrained and therefore makes predictable.
