At standstill, ωm = 0, so that the slip S = 1 and fr = fs; that is, the machine then acts as a simple
transformer with an air gap and a short-circuited secondary winding. A steady starting torque is
produced because the condition for energy conversion at constant torque is satisﬁed; hence the
polyphase induction motor is self-starting. At synchronous speed, however, ωm = ωs, so that the
slip S = 0 and fr = 0; no induction takes place because there is no relative motion between ﬂux
and rotor conductors. Thus, at synchronous speed, the value of the secondary mmf is zero, and
no torque is produced; that is, the induction motor cannot run at synchronous speed. The no-load
speed of the induction motor is usually on the order of 99.5% of synchronous speed so that the
no-load per-unit slip is about 0.005, and the full-load per-unit slip is on the order of 0.05. Thus,
the polyphase induction motor is effectively a constant-speed machine.
