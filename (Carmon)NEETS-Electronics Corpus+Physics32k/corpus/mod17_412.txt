Now let's look at figure 3-29, view B, where channel one is shown sampled four times. (This is the 
output of channel one in our transmitter.) Figure 3-29, view C, shows all six channels being sampled four 
times during each cycle. (This is the output of the rotating switch in our transmitter.) What you see here is 
a continuous, time-sharing waveform.
