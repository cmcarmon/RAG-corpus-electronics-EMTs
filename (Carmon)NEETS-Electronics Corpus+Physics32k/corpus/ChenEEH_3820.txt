Another similar histogram manipulation technique is histo-
gram speciﬁcation, where we try to make the histogram of an
image as similar as possible to a given one (Gonzalez and Wintz,
1977; Jain, 1989). Some texts refer to histogram matching. It
is a kind of histogram speciﬁcation technique in which the
histogram of an image is matched to the one of another image.
It can be used, for example, when there are two images of the
same scene taken from two different sensors.
