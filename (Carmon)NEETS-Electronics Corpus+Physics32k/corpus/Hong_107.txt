The inverting amplifier circuit is shown in Figure 8.4. The input is applied to the 
resistor R1 which is connected to the op ampâ€™s minus terminal. The plus terminal is tied 
to ground while the output is fed back to the negative terminal through resistor RF. Since 
no current flows into the minus terminal, all current sourced from the source through R1 
must be drained through RF. The feedback mechanism ensures that voltages at the plus 
and minus terminals are equal, which means that
