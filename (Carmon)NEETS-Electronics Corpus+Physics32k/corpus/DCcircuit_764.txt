Rather than just measure the resistance of the second conductor to the sheath (Rc2−s), what
we’ll actually measure is that resistance in parallel with the series combination of conductor-
to-conductor resistance (Rc1−c2) and the ﬁrst conductor to the sheath (Rc1−s). If we don’t care
about this fact, we can proceed with the test as conﬁgured.
If we desire to measure only
