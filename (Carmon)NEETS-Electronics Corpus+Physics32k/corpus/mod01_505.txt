The value of the voltage dropped by a resistor is determined by the applied voltage and is in
proportion to the circuit resistances. The voltage drops that occur in a series circuit are in direct
proportion to the resistances. This is the result of having the same current flow through each resistorâ€”the
larger the ohmic value of the resistor, the larger the voltage drop across it.
