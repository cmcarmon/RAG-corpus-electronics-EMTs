15.2.9 In an AM transmitter that transmits a total power
of 1 kW, the unmodulated carrier power is 850
W. Compute the required value of (Si /Ni )AM at a
receiver, if (S0/N0)AM = 2ηAM(Si /Ni )AM must
be 103 for good performance.
15.2.10 At the transmitter in a standard AM system, Pf =
50 W. In the receiver (S0/N0)AM = 250 when
(Si /Ni )AM = 3000. Find the transmitter’s un-
modulated carrier power and the total transmitted
power if (S0/N0)AM = 2ηAM(Si /Ni )AM.
