Current capacity limited by anode mass and self consumption at low current density.
Lower driving voltage means the anodes may not work in high-resistivity environments.
Often require that structure be electrically isolated from other structures and ground.
Anodes are heavy and will increase water resistance on moving structures or pipe interiors.
Where D.C. power is available, electrical energy can be obtained more cheaply than by galvanic anodes.
Where large arrays are used wiring is needed due to high current flow and need to keep resistance losses low.
Anodes must be carefully placed to avoid interfering with water flow into the propeller.
