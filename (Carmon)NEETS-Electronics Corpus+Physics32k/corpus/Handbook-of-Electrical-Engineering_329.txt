Thévenin theorem: The current ﬂowing in any impedance connected to two terminals of a linear, bilateral
network containing generators is equal to the current ﬂowing in the same impedance when it is connected
to a voltage generator whose voltage is the voltage at the open-circuited terminals in question and whose
series  impedance  is  the  impedance  of  the  network  looking  back  from  the  terminals  into  the  network,
with all generators replaced by their internal impedances.
