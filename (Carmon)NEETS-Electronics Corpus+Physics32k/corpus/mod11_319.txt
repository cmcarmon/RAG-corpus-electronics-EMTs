Signals from a number of different sources may contribute to or subtract from the overall effect. By 
properly phasing the energy fed to the antenna elements, and by properly locating the elements, you can 
control the direction of the energy. You can cause the energy to add in the desired direction and to be out 
of phase (cancel) in the undesired direction.
