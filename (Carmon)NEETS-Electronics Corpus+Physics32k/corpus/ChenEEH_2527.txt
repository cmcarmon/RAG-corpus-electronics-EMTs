Transmission-line-based impedance transformation is made
possible through distributed effects, which may also be realized
by using lumped-element-based networks in terms of ca-
pacitors and inductors. Capacitors and inductors connected
in L-/p-shaped conÔ¨Ågurations are widely used as impedance-
matching networks. There are eight possible arrangements of
the LC network topology, as shown in Figure 7.14. They are
popular in the design of miniaturized ICs, such as monolithic
(MMIC) and high-density hybrid circuits (MHMIC) as well as
low-frequency ICs.
