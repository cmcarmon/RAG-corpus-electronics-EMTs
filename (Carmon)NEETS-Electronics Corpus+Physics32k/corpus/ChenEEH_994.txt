This increase in the number of transistors per package allowed
more functions to be integrated and increased the total logic
density of a chip. For example, Figure 5.3(A) indicates that the
logic density for the Intel microprocessors doubles every process
generation. At the same time, the frequency of operation has
dramatically increased due to the device scaling, Figure 5.3(B)
shows the introduction of performance boosting techniques,
such as pipelining, super-pipelining, and parallel architectures.
This increase in operating frequency was driven by the need for
fast digital systems realizing powerful personal workstations,
sophisticated computer graphics, and multimedia capabilities,
such as real-time speech recognition and real-time video (Chan-
drakasan et al., 1992). When CMOS technology was introduced,
it was believed that the power consumption problem was solved.
The major concerns of the VLSI designer were mainly speed,
cost, and reliability; power consideration was mostly of second-
ary importance (Pedram, 1995). But as major concerns were
being met, the power dissipated in a chip has increased from one
generation to another. Figure 5.4 shows the power dissipation of
the Intel family of microprocessors.
