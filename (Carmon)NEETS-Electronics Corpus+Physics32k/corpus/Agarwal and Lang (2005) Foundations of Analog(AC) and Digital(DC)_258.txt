This result is important because it shows that the branch currents passing
through two series-connected elements must be the same. That is, there is
nowhere for the current i1 to go as it enters the node connecting the two ele-
ments except to exit that node as i2. In fact, with multiple applications of KCL,
this observation is extendible to a longer string of series-connected elements.
Such an extension would show that a common branch current passes through
a string of series-connected elements.
