Room-Temperature Semiconductors
Applications arise that require energy resolution beyond the capability of scintillator systems and where cryo-
genically cooled semiconductors are not suitable. Examples include detector probes for monitoring restricted
areas,  monitoring  at  remote  sites  where  replenishing  the  coolant  is  impractical,  spectral  imaging,  and  many
portable instrument applications. There is available a class of semiconductor detectors that satisfy many such
needs  by  providing  energy  resolution  substantially  better  than  the  best  scintillators  (although  inferior  to
cryogenic semiconductors) while operating at ambient temperature. In addition to spectroscopy, these devices
are also useful for counting applications where high detection efÔ¨Åciency per unit volume is required. In these
applications, the devices are operated in pulse mode wherein the charge associated with single photon absorp-
tion events is recorded. They also can be operated in a current mode in the manner of a solid-state ion chamber.
In their current stage of development, room-temperature detectors are limited in size and best suited for the
energy region below 1 MeV.
