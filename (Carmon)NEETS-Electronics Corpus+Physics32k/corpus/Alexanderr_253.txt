Such  a  circuit  has  a  very  high  input  impedance  and  is  therefore  use-
ful as an intermediate-stage (or buffer) ampliﬁer to isolate one circuit
from  another,  as  portrayed  in  Fig.  5.18.  The  voltage  follower  mini-
mizes  interaction  between  the  two  stages  and  eliminates  interstage
loading.
