where v(t) and i(t) are defined using the associated variables discipline. The
unit of energy is the joule.
(cid:1) Ohm’s law states that resistors that obey Ohm’s law satisfy the equation v =
iR, where R is constant. The resistance of a piece of homogeneous material
is proportional to its length and inversely proportional to its cross-sectional
area.
