In simulation experiments, multiple errors of different pat-
terns were injected on the memory and cache busses at various
repeat frequencies and duty cycles to simulate the effect of EM
interference on a computer system (see footnote 4). These
errors can be caught by the HC detector and/or the WD. The
maximum error detection latency of the HC error detector is
one instruction execution and that of the WD is bmax instruc-
tion executions, where bmax is the maximum block size of the
program after CFC-based augmentation as described in
Section 8.4 (note again that here the rollback distance unit is
an instruction execution and not a clock cycle). Whenever
either the HC or the WD detects an error, the microrollback
unit is signaled and microrollback of the appropriate distance
occurs (¼ error latency of the detector—one instruction exe-
cution for HC and bi instruction executions for the WD if bi is
the size of the current block). When both the HC and WD
detect errors simultaneously, the HC is given priority, and a
rollback of one instruction is performed.
