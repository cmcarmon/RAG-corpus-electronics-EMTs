An important detail emerges when we consider making this program work; in fact, as written it has (at
least) two bugs. What input and output values enter into the computation of y (1)? We need values for
y (0) , y (−1) , . . . values we have not yet computed. To compute them, we would need more previous values of
the output, which we have not yet computed. To compute these values, we would need even earlier values, ad
inﬁnitum. The way out of this predicament is to specify the system’s initial conditions: we must provide
the p output values that occurred before the input started. These values can be arbitrary, but the choice
does impact how the system responds to a given input. One choice gives rise to a linear system: Make the
initial conditions zero. The reason lies in the deﬁnition of a linear system: The only way that the output to
