CONDUCTORS, SEMICONDUCTORS, AND INSULATORS are categorized as such by the
number of valence electrons in their atoms. The conductor normally has 3 or less valence electrons and
offers little opposition to the flow of electrons (electric current). The insulator contains 5 or more valence
electrons and offers high opposition to electron flow. The semiconductor usually has four valence
electrons of conductivity and is in the midrange. The best conductors in order of conductance are silver,
copper, gold, and aluminum.
