say, the DPSK waveform in a given bit interval serves as its own local-oscillator signal in the
following bit interval.
In Figure 15.3.17, si(t) is the signal component of the matched ﬁlter output, and sd(t) is the
signal component of the detector output. If the phases of both si(t) and si(t − Tb) are the same,
sd(t) is then a positive voltage; if their phases differ by π radians, sd(t) will then be a negative
voltage. These voltages will have maximum amplitudes at the sample time at the end of the bit
interval. Because the sign of the voltage at the sampler depends upon the phase relationship
between si(t) and its delayed replica, and the sign of sd(t) is of the same form as d(t), the
original digital bit sequence can be determined by sampling to decide the sign of the detector
output.
