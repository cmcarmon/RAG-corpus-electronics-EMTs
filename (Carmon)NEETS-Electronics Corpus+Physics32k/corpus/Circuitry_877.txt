In  the  case  of  a  joint  to  be  made  between  a 
component  and  a  PCB  pad,  a  slightly  different 
technique 
the  requisites  for 
cleanliness  still  apply).  The  component  should  be 
fitted to the PCB (bending its leads appropriately at 
right angles if it is an axial lead component)  such 
that  its  leads  protrude  through  the  PCB  to  the 
copper  foil  side.  The  leads  should  be  trimmed  to 
within  a  few  millimetres  of  the  copper  pad  then 
bent  slightly  (so  that  the  component  does  not  fall 
out when the board is inverted) before soldering in 
place.  Opinions  differ  concerning 
the  angles 
through which the component leads should be bent. 
For easy removal, the leads should not be bent at all 
while,  for  the  best  mechanical  joint,  the  leads 
should  be  bent  through  90°.  A  good  compromise, 
and  that  preferred  by  the  author  involves  bending 
the leads through about 45°. Care should again be 
taken to use the minimum of solder consistent with 
making a sound electrical and mechanical joint. 
  Finally,  it  is  important  to  realize  that  good 
soldering  technique  usually  takes  time  to  develop 
and the old adage ‘practice makes perfect’ is very 
apt  in  this  respect.  Do  not  despair  if  your  first 
efforts fail to match with those of the professional!
