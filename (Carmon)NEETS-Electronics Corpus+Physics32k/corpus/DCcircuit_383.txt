Also, it must be remembered that digital multimeters usually do a good job of discriminat-
ing between AC and DC measurements, as they are set for one or the other when checking
for voltage or current. As we have seen earlier, both AC and DC voltages and currents can be
deadly, so when using a multimeter as a safety check device you should always check for the
presence of both AC and DC, even if you’re not expecting to ﬁnd both! Also, when checking for
the presence of hazardous voltage, you should be sure to check all pairs of points in question.
For example, suppose that you opened up an electrical wiring cabinet to ﬁnd three large
conductors supplying AC power to a load. The circuit breaker feeding these wires (supposedly)
has been shut off, locked, and tagged. You double-checked the absence of power by pressing the
