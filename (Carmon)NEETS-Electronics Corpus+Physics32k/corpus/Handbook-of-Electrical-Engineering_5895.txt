A  disadvantage  of  induction  generators  is  that  they  are  highly  inductive.  Because  the  current  and  voltage
have very large phase shifts, delivering a moderate amount of power requires an unnecessarily high current on
the power line. This current can be reduced by connecting capacitors at the terminals of the machine. Capacitors
have negative reactance; thus, the machineâ€™s inductive reactance can be compensated. Such a scheme is known
as capacitive compensation. It is ideal to have a compensation in which the capacitor and equivalent inductor
completely cancel the effect of each other. In windmill applications, for example, this faces a great challenge
because  the  varying  speed  of  the  rotor  (as  a  result  of  wind  speed)  implies  a  varying  equivalent  inductor.
Fortunately, strategies for ideal compensation have been designed and put to commercial use.
