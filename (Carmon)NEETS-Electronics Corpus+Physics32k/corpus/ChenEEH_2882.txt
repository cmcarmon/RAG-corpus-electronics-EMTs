Consider an airborne pulse radar pointing its antenna
toward the ground or sea surface at a depression angle. If the
area illuminated by the pulse is smaller than the area covered
by the antenna beamwidth, then the illumination is called
pulse width-limited illumination. If the area covered by the
antenna beamwidth is smaller than that covered by the pulse,
the illumination is called beamwidth-limited illumination.
With pulse width-limited illumination, the received clutter
power is inversely proportional to R3, whereas with beam-
width-limited illumination, the received clutter power is in-
versely proportional to R2.
