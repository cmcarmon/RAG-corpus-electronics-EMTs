These first Heisler-Gröber charts were based upon the first term of the exact Fourier Series solution for an infinite plane wall:

{\displaystyle {\frac {T(x,t)-T_{\infty }}{T_{i}-T_{\infty }}}=\sum _{n=0}^{\infty }{\left[{\frac {4\sin {\lambda _{n}}}{2\lambda _{n}+\sin {2\lambda _{n}}}}e^{-\lambda _{n}^{2}{\frac {\alpha t}{L^{2}}}}\cos {\frac {\lambda _{n}x}{L}}\right]}}
,
where Ti is the initial temperature of the slab, T∞ is the constant temperature imposed at the boundary, x is the location in the plane wall, λn is π(n+1/2), and α is thermal diffusivity. The position x=0 represents the center of the slab.
The first chart for the plane wall is plotted using 3 different variables. Plotted along the vertical axis of the chart is dimensionless temperature at the midplane, θo*

. Plotted along the horizontal axis is the Fourier Number, Fo=αt/L2 . The curves within the graph are a selection of values for the inverse of the Biot Number, where "Bi = hL/k. k is the thermal conductivity of the material and h is the heat transfer coefficient."

The second chart is used to determine the variation of temperature within the plane wall for different Biot Numbers. The vertical axis is the ratio of a given temperature to that at the centerline θ/θo

where the x/L curve is the position at which T is taken. The horizontal axis is the value of Bi−1.

The third chart in each set was supplemented by Gröber in 1961 and this particular one shows the dimensionless heat transferred from the wall as a function of a dimensionless time variable. The vertical axis is a plot of Q/Qo, the ratio of actual heat transfer to the amount of total possible heat transfer before T=T∞ . On the horizontal axis is the plot of (Bi2)(Fo), a dimensionless time variable.
