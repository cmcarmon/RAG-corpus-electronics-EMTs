Certain atmospheric and ionospheric conditions can also cause the normal line-of-sight range to be 
extended. Frequencies at the lower end of this band are capable of overcoming the shielding effects of 
hills and structures to some degree; but as the frequency is increased, the problem becomes more 
pronounced. Reception is notably free from atmospheric and man-made static. (The VERY-HIGH-
FREQUENCY (vhf) and ULTRAHIGH-FREQUENCY (uhf) bands are known as line-of-sight 
transmission bands.) Because this is line-of-sight communications, the transmitting antenna is in a direct 
line with the receiving antenna and not over the horizon. The line-of-sight characteristic makes the vhf 
band ideal for amphibious operations (beach landing from sea craft) and the uhf well suited for tactical 
voice transmissions (maneuvering of ships traveling together). The SUPERHIGH-FREQUENCY (shf) 
band is used for radar and satellite communications, whereas the EXTREMELY HIGH-FREQUENCY 
(ehf) band is used only in the experimental stage.
