Tisserand's criterion is computed in a circular restricted three-body system. In a circular restricted three-body system, one of the masses is assumed to be much smaller than the other two. The other two masses are assumed to be in a circular orbit about the system’s center of mass. In addition, Tisserand's criterion also relies on the assumptions that a) one of the two larger masses is much smaller than the other large mass and b) the comet or asteroid has not had a close approach to any other large mass.
Two observed orbiting bodies are possibly the same if they satisfy or nearly satisfy Tisserand's criterion:

{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2a_{1}}}+{\sqrt {a_{1}(1-e_{1}^{2})}}\cos i_{1}={\frac {1}{2a_{2}}}+{\sqrt {a_{2}(1-e_{2}^{2})}}\cos i_{2}}

where a is the semimajor axis, e is the eccentricity, and i is the inclination of the body’s orbit.
In other words, if a function of the orbital elements (named Tisserand's parameter) of the first observed body (nearly) equals the same function calculated with the orbital elements of the second observed body, the two bodies might be the same.
