GAIN AND DIRECTIVITY.â€”The physical disposition of dipoles operated broadside to each other 
allows for much greater coupling between them than can occur between collinear elements. Moving the 
parallel antenna elements closer together or farther apart affects the actual impedance of the entire array 
and the overall radiation resistance as well. As the spacing between broadside elements increases, the 
effect on the radiation pattern is a sharpening of the major lobes. When the array consists of only two 
dipoles spaced exactly 1/2 wavelength apart, no minor lobes are generated at all. Increasing the distance 
between the elements beyond that point, however, tends to throw off the phase relationship between the 
original current in one element and the current induced in it by the other element. The result is that, 
although the major lobes are sharpened, minor lobes are introduced, even with two elements. These, 
however, are not large enough to be of concern.
