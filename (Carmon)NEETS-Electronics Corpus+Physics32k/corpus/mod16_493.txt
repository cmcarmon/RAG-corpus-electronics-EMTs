Several accessories are available for use with the electronic digital multimeter. One accessory is the
test lead kit, shown in figure 4-10. The kit contains two color-coded test leads with threaded adapters.
These adapters attach to banana plugs, pin tips, test prod tips, alligator clips, and binding post lugs.
