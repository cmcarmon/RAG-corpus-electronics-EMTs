the slip, so a smaller capacitor is needed for optimal running
performance. Suitable values for starting and running are
achieved by using a short-time rated capacitor in parallel
with the running capacitor. The short-time rated capacitor is
removed when the motor comes up to speed. The conﬁgu-
ration of the two-value capacitor motor is illustrated in Figure
4.30. Because of the running capacitor, this motor basically has
a two-phase supply and, therefore, runs more efﬁciently and
quietly.
