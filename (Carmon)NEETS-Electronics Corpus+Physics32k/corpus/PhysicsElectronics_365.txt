A common method for generating even more charge carriers in a semiconductor is by
doping. That is, replacing a few atoms of the base material with atoms of a diï¬€erent element.
These impurities will contribute an excess electron or hole which is loosely bound and hence
can be excited into the conduction band by thermal energy. In N-type semiconductors the
majority of free charge carriers are negative, while in a P-type semiconductor the majority
are positive.
