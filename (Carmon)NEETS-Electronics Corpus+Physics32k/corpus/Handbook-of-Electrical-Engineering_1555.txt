Tree Search
The search for the most likely word sequence can be thought of as searching for a path in a tree whose branches
are labeled with the various words of the vocabulary V such that there are |V| branches leaving each node, one
for each word (i.e., the size of the vocabulary). Typically, in large vocabulary continuous speech recognition,
this  search  from  a  tree  of  possible  hypotheses  turns  out  to  be  a  very  large  computational  effort.  Hence,  the
search is limited by a fast match approach [26] that will reject from consideration several branches of the tree
without subjecting them to a detailed analysis. The Viterbi algorithm achieves the same kind of pruning using
the beam search approach and multi-pass strategies.
