Driving current through a resistance
If you place a voltage source across an electronic component 
that has measurable resistance (such as a light bulb or a resistor), 
the force of the voltage will push electrons through the component. The move-
ment of gobs of electrons is what constitutes electric current. By applying a 
greater voltage, you exert a stronger force on the electrons, which creates a 
stronger flow of  electrons — a larger current — through the resistance. The 
stronger the force (voltage V  ), the stronger the flow of electrons (current I  ).
