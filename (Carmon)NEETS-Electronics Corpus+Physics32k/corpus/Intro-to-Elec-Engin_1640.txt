The block diagram is a pictorial representation of the equations of the system. Each block
represents a mathematical operation, and the blocks are interconnected to satisfy the governing
equations of the system. The block diagram thus provides a chart of the procedure to be followed
in combining the simultaneous equations, from which useful information can often be obtained
without Ô¨Ånding a complete analytical solution. The block-diagram technique has been highly
developed in connection with studies of feedback control systems, often leading to programming
a problem for solution on an analog computer.
