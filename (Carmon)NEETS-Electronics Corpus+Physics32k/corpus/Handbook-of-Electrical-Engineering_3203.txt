current i then oscillates sinusoidally and goes to zero in the natural way. The current tries to reverse,
and the path for this current is provided by the diode D1. Conduction of D1 feeds the reactive energy in
the load and the tank circuit back to the supply. The on-state of D1 also provides a reverse voltage across
S1, allowing it to turn off. After providing a time equal to or greater than the turn-off time of S1, switch
S2 can be turned on to initiate the second half cycle. The process is similar to the Ô¨Årst half cycle, with
the voltage across vAB being of opposite polarity, and the functions of D1, S1 will be assumed by D2, S2.
With  this  type  of  operation,  the  converter  works  in  the  continuous  current  mode  as  the  switches  are
turned on before the currents in the diodes reach zero. If the switching on of S1 and S2 is delayed such
that  the  currents  through  the  previously  conducting  diodes  reach  zero,  then  there  are  zero  current
intervals and the inverter operates in the DCM [Fig. 30.33(b)].
