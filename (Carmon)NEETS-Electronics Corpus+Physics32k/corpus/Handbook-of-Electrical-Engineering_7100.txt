An orbit for which the highest altitude (apogee) is greater than GEO is sometimes referred to as high earth
orbit (HEO). Low earth orbits (LEO) typically range from a few hundred km to about 2000 km. Medium earth
orbits (MEO) are at intermediate altitudes. Circular MEO orbits, also called Intermediate Circular Orbits (ICO)
