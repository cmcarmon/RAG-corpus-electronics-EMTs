Another interesting application is the use of an array to mitigate discrete noise sources in a room. For this,
we  need  to  attach  an  FIR  ﬁlter  to  each  of  the  microphone  signal  outputs.  For  any  given  frequency,  one  can

More information on microphone arrays can be found in Flanagan et al. [1991]; in particular, they describe
how  to  make  arrays  adapt  to  changing  talker  positions  in  a  room  by  constantly  scanning  the  room  with  a
moving search beam and by switching the main beam accordingly. Current research issues are, among others,
3-D arrays and how to take advantage of low-order wall reﬂections.
