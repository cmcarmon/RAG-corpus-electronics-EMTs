Although  we  have  used  ac  circuit  techniques  to  calculate  faults,  the
problem  is  fundamentally  transient  since  it  involves  sudden  switching
actions.  Consider  the  so-called  dc  offset  current. We  model  the  system  by  determining  its  positive  sequence
Th√©venin equivalent circuit, looking back into the positive sequence network at the fault, as shown in Fig. 61.38.
The transient fault current is
