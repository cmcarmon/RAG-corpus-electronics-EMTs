Summaries.
In large industrial areas, all these lighting systems may be used. In small areas, localized general
lighting may also serve as a substitute for general lighting. In this case, additional supplementary lighting may
be required to increase the quantity or improve the quality of the illumination. Many factors must be considered
in selecting a lighting system. It is not feasible to recommend one or two systems for all conditions. Because
of  the  relationship  of  ceiling  height  to  light  utilization,  most  industrial  applications  call  for  either  direct  or
semi-direct lighting systems.
