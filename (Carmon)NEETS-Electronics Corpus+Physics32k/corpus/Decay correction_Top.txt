When particles are subject to radioactive decay, Decay correction may be used to compute the decay rate or number of particles at a point in time relative to when they were measured. This is necessary when comparing measurements obtained at different points in time. For example, the decay rate of a parent radionuclide is proportional to the number of atoms; as time passes some of atoms decay into daughter nuclides reducing the number of parent atoms.
