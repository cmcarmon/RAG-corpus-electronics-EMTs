Delta Connection (Fig. 1.26)
In the delta connection, the Ô¨Ånish point of each winding is connected
to the start point of the adjacent winding to form a closed triangle, or
delta. A delta winding in the transformer tends to balance out unbal-
anced  loads  that  are  present  on  the  system.  Each  phase  of  the  delta
winding  only  carries  57.7%  of  the  line  current,  whereas  the  phase
voltages are equal to the line voltages.
