 (DGPS) employs one or more ground stations at known locations, that receive GPS signals
and transmit measured errors on a radio link to nearby ships and aircraft. DGPS improves accuracy (centimeters
for Ô¨Åxed observers) and detects faults in GPS satellites. In 1997, the U.S. was conducting experiments with a
 (WAAS) could eventually
nationwide DGPS system of about 25 stations. This 
replace VORTAC and Category I ILS. A denser network of DGPS stations and GPS-emulating pseudolites, whose
stations are located at airports, might replace ILS and MLS (below). In 1997, the cost, accuracy, and reliability
 (LAAS) were still being compared to existing landing aids but marine
of such a 
LAAS were in operation for navigation into harbors in North America, the North Sea, and the Baltic Sea.
