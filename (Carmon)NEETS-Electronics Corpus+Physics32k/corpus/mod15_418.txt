Figure 4-7 illustrates the use of a resolver in solving a resolution problem. Assume that a voltage, E,
and an angle, R, represent the magnitude and direction of a known quantity. To determine the two right-
angle components of the quantity, feed the magnitude of the quantity to one stator coil and physically turn
the rotor through angle R. The input voltage (E) induces voltage E1 and E2 in the two rotor coils. The
values of these rotor voltages represent the vertical and horizontal components of the known quantity and
depend on both the value of E and the angle (R) through which the rotor was turned.
