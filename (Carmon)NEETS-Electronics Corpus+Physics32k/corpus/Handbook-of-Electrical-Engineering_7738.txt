Although  increased  densities  are  inevitable,  the  problem  is  primarily  economic.  Increasing  the  tracks  per
inch  may  make  seeks  slower  as  it  becomes  more  time  consuming  for  the  heads  to  correctly “lock”  onto  the
appropriate track. The sensing electronics get more complex and thus more expensive. Once again, it can be
argued that higher capacity can be achieved at lower cost by using several smaller disks rather than one expensive
high-density disk.
