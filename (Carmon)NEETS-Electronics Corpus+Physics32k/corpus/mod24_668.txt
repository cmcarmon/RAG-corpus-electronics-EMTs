An SLD is, in essence, a combination of a laser and an ELED. SLDs are similar in geometry to lasers
but have no built-in optical feedback mechanism required by laser diodes for stimulated emission to
achieve lasing. SLDs have structural features similar to those of ELEDs that suppress the lasing action by
reducing the reflectivity of the facets. SLDs are essentially highly optimized ELEDs.
