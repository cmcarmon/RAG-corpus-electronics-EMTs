One of the most common DSP applications is the analysis of signals that have been collected from experiments
or from a physical environment. These signals are typically stored in data ﬁles, and often need preprocessing
steps applied to them before we are able to extract the desired information. Preprocessing can include removing
means or linear trends, ﬁltering noise, removing anomalies, and interpolating for missing data. Once the data
is ready to analyze, we are usually interested in statistical information (mean, median, variance, autocorrelation,
etc.) along with an estimate of the distribution of the values (uniform, Gaussian, etc.). The frequency content
of a signal is also important to determine; if the signal is non-stationary, the frequency content needs to be
determined using short time windows.
