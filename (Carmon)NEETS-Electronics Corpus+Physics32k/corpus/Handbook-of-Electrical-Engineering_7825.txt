The signal that controls the voice coil is obtained from the light reﬂected from the disk. There are several
techniques  for  deriving  the  focus  error  signal,  one  of  which  is  depicted  in  Fig. 80.27(a).  In  this  so-called
obscuration  method  a  secondary  lens  is  placed  in  the  path  of  the  reﬂected  light,  one-half  of  its  aperture  is
covered,  and  a  split  detector  is  placed  at  its  focal  plane.  When  the  disk  is  in  focus,  the  returning  beam  is
collimated  and  the  secondary  lens  will  focus  the  beam  at  the  center  of  the  split  detector,  giving  a  difference
