It should also be understood that some materials experience changes in their electrical
properties under different conditions. Glass, for instance, is a very good insulator at room
temperature, but becomes a conductor when heated to a very high temperature. Gases such
as air, normally insulating materials, also become conductive if heated to very high tempera-
tures. Most metals become poorer conductors when heated, and better conductors when cooled.
Many conductive materials become perfectly conductive (this is called superconductivity) at ex-
tremely low temperatures.
