: An A/D conversion process where the digital output code represents the change, or slope,
of the analog input signal, rather than the absolute value of the analog input signal. A 1 indicates a rising
slope of the input signal. A 0 indicates a falling slope of the input signal. The sampling rate is dependent
on the derivative of the signal, since a rapidly changing signal would require a rapid sampling rate for
acceptable performance.
