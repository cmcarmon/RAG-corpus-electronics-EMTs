Within the application program, each thread runs as if it were the only thread of control. It may call functions,
manipulate memory, perform I/O operations, etc. If the threads do not interact with each other, then, to the
application programmer, there is little change other than determining how to subdivide the program. However,
it would be unusual for these threads not to interact. It is this interaction that makes parallel programming
more complex.
