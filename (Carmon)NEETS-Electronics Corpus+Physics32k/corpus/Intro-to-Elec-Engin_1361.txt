with fco = ωco/2π = 100 Hz. If x(t) is a
triangular wave of Figure E14.1.4(b), with A =
π 2/8 and T = 25 ms, obtain an approximate
expression for the periodic steady-state response
y(t). See Figure 14.1.5.
14.2.1 (a) Let x(t) = 12 cos 2π100t + 8 cos 2π150t,
and xc(t) = x(t) cos 2πfct, where fc = 600
Hz. Sketch the amplitude spectrum.
