An audio signal generator may not be able to produce a high enough voltage for you to test Zener
diodes. You can, however, make this test with a diode test set or with the circuit shown in figure 2-10. In
this circuit, R1 is used to adjust the input voltage to a suitable value for the Zener diode being tested.
Resistor R2 limits the current through the diode. The signal voltage applied to the diode is also connected
to the horizontal input of the oscilloscope. The voltage developed across current-measuring resistor R3 is
applied to the vertical input of the oscilloscope. The horizontal sweep will therefore represent the applied
voltage, and the vertical deflection will indicate the current through the diode under test. Figure 2-11
shows the characteristic pattern of a Zener diode (note the sharp increase in current at the avalanche
breakdown point). For the Zener diode to be acceptable, this voltage must be within the limits specified
by the manufacturer.
