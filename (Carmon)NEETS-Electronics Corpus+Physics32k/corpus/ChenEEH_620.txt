Although the word lengths k and l computed via equations
1.13 and 1.14 meet the posed equivalence speciﬁcations of
equations 1.11 and 1.12, LNS is capable of covering a signiﬁ-
cantly larger range than the equivalent ﬁxed-point representa-
tion. Let neq denote the word length of a ﬁxed-point system
that can cover the range offered by an LNS deﬁned through
equations 1.13 and 1.14. Equivalently, let neq be the smallest
integer, which satisﬁes:
