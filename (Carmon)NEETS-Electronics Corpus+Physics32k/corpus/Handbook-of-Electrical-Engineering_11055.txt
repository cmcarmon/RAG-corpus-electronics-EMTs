Stimulators
With magnetic (eddy-current) stimulation, three circuits and two coil geometries are used. The simplest circuit
is illustrated in Fig. 113.25, which shows a capacitor (C) being discharged into the stimulating coil (L). The
induced current (i) is proportional to the rate of change (di/dt) of the coil current (i). The resistance (R) in
the entire circuit is low and the coil current is an underdamped sinusoid. The tissue is stimulated by the induced
current density J = k(de/dx)/r, where de/dx is the induced voltage gradient, r is the tissue resistivity, and k is
a constant that depends on coil geometry and target distance. The effective stimulus duration (d) is from the
onset of the induced current to the Ô¨Årst zero crossing as shown in Fig. 113.25. Typical durations (d) range from
20 to 200 msec. When the damping is low, the multiple pulses of induced current can elicit responses, providing
the period is longer than the refractory period of the tissue being stimulated. Note that the capacitor voltage
falls to zero and the capacitor must be recharged to deliver the next stimulus.
