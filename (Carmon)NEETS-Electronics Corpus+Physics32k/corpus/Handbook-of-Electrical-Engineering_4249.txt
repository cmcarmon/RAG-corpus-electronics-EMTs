Detection and Search
Detection  processing  consists  of  comparing  the  amplitude  of  each  range  gate/Doppler  ﬁlter  output  with  a
threshold. A detection is reported if the amplitude exceeds that threshold. A false alarm occurs when noise or
other interference produces an output of sufﬁcient magnitude to exceed the detection threshold. As the detection
threshold  is  decreased,  both  the  detection  probability  and  the  false  alarm  probability  increase.  S/N  must  be
increased to enhance detection probability while maintaining a constant false alarm probability.
