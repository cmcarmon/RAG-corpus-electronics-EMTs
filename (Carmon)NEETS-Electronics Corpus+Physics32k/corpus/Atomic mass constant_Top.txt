In physics and chemistry, the atomic mass constant, mu, is one twelfth of the mass of an unbound atom of carbon-12 at rest and in its ground state. It serves to define the atomic mass unit and is, by definition, equal to 1 u. The CODATA recommended value is 1.660539040(20)×10−27 kg.
In practice, the atomic mass constant is determined as the ratio of the electron rest mass me to the electron relative atomic mass Ar(e) (that is, the mass of the electron on a scale where 12C = 12). The relative atomic mass of the electron can be measured in cyclotron experiments, while the rest mass of the electron can be derived from other physical constants.

The current uncertainty in the value of the atomic mass constant – one part in 20 million – is almost entirely due to the uncertainty in the value of the Planck constant.
