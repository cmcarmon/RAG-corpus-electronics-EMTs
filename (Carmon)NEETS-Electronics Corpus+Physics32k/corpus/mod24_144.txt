dimension of the cladding region. The modes trapped in the cladding region are called cladding modes.
As the core and the cladding modes travel along the fiber, mode coupling occurs. Mode coupling is the
exchange of power between two modes. Mode coupling to the cladding results in the loss of power from
the core modes.
