A digital signal is a discontinuous signal that changes from one state to another in discrete steps. A
popular form of digital modulation is binary, or two level, digital modulation. In binary modulation the
optical signal is switched from a low-power level (usually off) to a high-power level. There are a number
of modulation techniques used in digital systems, but these will not be discussed here. For more
information on digital modulation techniques, refer to the references listed in appendix 2.
