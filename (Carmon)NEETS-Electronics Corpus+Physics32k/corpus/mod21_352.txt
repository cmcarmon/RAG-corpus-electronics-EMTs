Figure 3-14 shows a common output power meter used in vhf-uhf applications. It has a 0- to 150-
watt range covered in two steps: 0-50 watts and 0-150 watts. Attenuator AT1 provides a 50-ohm nominal 
resistive (dummy) load and uses metal film on glass construction. This dummy load is tapped to provide 
the proper operating voltage to the meter. Resistors R3 and R5 form a calibration network at 50 watts; R7 
and R8 form a calibration network at 150 watts. Accuracy, at approximately 20º C, is ±5% for frequencies 
between 30 MHz and 600 MHz, ±10% for frequencies between 0.6 GHz and 0.8 GHz, and ±20% for 
frequencies between 0.8 and 1.0 GHz. When radio-frequency (rf) power is applied to AT1, this attenuator 
minimizes the effects of power factors generated by any reactive components. The rf energy is then 
detected and filtered by CR1 and C1, respectively. The resultant dc voltage, which is proportional to the 
input power, is applied to a sensitive microammeter via one of the calibration networks. This meter has a 
scale provided with two ranges: 0-50 watts and 0-150 watts. To protect the meter, you should always try 
the higher range first. If the value proves to be under 50 watts, a shift to the lower scale would provide 
improved accuracy.
