Module Technologies
Solar cells are typically electrically connected into series and par-
allel strings to deliver a desired voltage and current and encapsu-
lated  into  a  supporting  structure  for  environmental  protection
and  strength.  The  module  is  a  composite  structure  involving
mechanical, optical, and electrical optimization that has required
the collaborating and overlapping knowledge of physics, chemis-
try, materials science, and engineering to ensure viability [Lasnier
and Ang, 1990]. The materials used for support and encapsulation
depend on both the solar cell type and the application/installation.
The  module  construction  determines  not  only  its  cost,  but  also
its lifetime. Module design has occupied a signiﬁcant portion of
the  development  efforts  in  photovoltaics,  and  the  complexities
and details for all photovoltaic materials are beyond the scope of
this  review.  However,  module  issues  are  almost  as  important  as
solar  cell  issues  because  they  directly  impact  the  performance,
lifetime,  and  cost  of  the  photovoltaic  technology  [Wohlgemuth,
1995].  The  module  is  central  to  meeting  not  only  the  efﬁciency
goals (e.g., 15 to 25% for modules), but also the system cost (e.g.,
$1.00  to  $1.50/W)  and  system  lifetime  (e.g.,  >30 years)  in  the
2010 to 2030 timeframe. (See Fig. 60.16.)
