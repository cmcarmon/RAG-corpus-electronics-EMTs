A  low-performance  I/O  system  might  dedicate  the  pathway  between  the  host  and  the  disk  for  the  entire
duration of the seek, rotate, and transfer times. Assuming small blocksizes, transfer time is a small component
of the overall service time, and these pathways can be better utilized if they are shared among multiple devices.
Thus, higher performance systems support independent seeks, in which a device can be directed to detach itself
from the pathway while seeking to the desired track (recall the discussion of dynamic path reconnect in the
previous  section).  The  advantage  is  that  multiple  seeks  can  be  overlapped,  reducing  overall  I/O  latency  and
better utilizing the available I/O bandwidth.
