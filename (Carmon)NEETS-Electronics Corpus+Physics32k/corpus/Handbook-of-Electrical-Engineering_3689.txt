AVCON, Inc. worked initially with Lewis Research Center on the development of a magnetic bearing
system for a cryogenic magnetic bearing test facility. The resulting AVCON development was extensively
tested over a two-year span and these tests provided a wealth of data on the performance of magnetic
bearings under severe conditions. In this program, AVCON developed the basic hybrid magnetic bearing
approach in which both permanent magnets and electromagnets are employed to suspend a shaft; the
permanent magnets provide suspension, the electromagnets provide control. Analyses of AVCON bearing
tests showed that a hybrid magnetic bearing test was typically only one-third the weight, substantially
smaller and dramatically less power-demanding than previous generations of magnetic bearings.
