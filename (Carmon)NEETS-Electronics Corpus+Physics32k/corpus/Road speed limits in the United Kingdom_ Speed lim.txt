Some classes of vehicles are required to have speed limiters which enforce a maximum speed by physical means. Older vehicles still in use do not have limiters fitted or have them set at a higher speeds. New vehicles should be fitted with limiters as follows:
Buses and coaches, including minibuses: 100 km/h (62 mph)
HGVs: 90 km/h (56 mph) or 85 km/h (53 mph) depending on class.
Mopeds: 45 km/h (28 mph)
Some other vehicles, especially light commercial or service vehicles, may be voluntarily fitted with limiters by their owners (either private businesspeople or company fleets), generally set at 90, 97, 100, 110 or 113 km/h (56, 60, 62, 68 or 70 mph), though some ultralight citybound service vehicles may be limited to 80 km/h (50 mph) or less. In all cases, a warning sticker must be displayed on the rear of the vehicle.
