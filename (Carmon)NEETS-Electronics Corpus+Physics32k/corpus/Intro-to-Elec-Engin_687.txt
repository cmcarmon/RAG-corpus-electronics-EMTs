2. Monolithic technology, in which all the parts (such as transistors, resistors, capacitors, and
diodes) needed for a complete circuit (such as an ampliÔ¨Åer circuit) are constructed at the
same time from one silicon wafer (which is typically 5 mils or 0.005 inch in thickness).
3. Hybrid technology, a combination of the preceding two technologies, in which various
circuit components constructed on individual chips are connected so that the hybrid IC
resembles a discrete circuit packaged into a single, small case.
