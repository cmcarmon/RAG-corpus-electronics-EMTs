Serial  Wire  Matrix  Printing. This  technology  employs  an  array  of  guided  wires  (often  tungsten)  that  are
individually driven into the ribbon/paper set (see Fig. 89.36). The array may form a single-row conﬁguration
at the plane of ribbon impact, may have two in-line rows, or may have two staggered rows. Nine wire designs
became very popular in the 1980s for low-cost personal computer systems, but the demand for higher print
quality has moved the “standard” design point to 24 wires. Early technology limited wire cycle repetition rates
to about 500 Hz. More advanced designs can perform at 2500 Hz, but most available products operate in the
1000–1500 Hz range.
