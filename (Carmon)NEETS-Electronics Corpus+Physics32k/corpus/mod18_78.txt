Altitude- or height-finding search radars use a beam that is very narrow in the vertical plane. The
beam is scanned in elevation, either mechanically or electronically, to pinpoint targets. Height-finding
radar systems that also determine bearing must have a beam that is very narrow in both the vertical and
horizontal planes. An electronic elevation-scanning pattern for a search radar set is illustrated in figure 1-10.
Lines originating at the antenna indicate the number of beam positions required for complete elevation
coverage. In practice the beams overlap slightly to prevent any gaps in the coverage. Each beam position
corresponds to a slight change in either the frequency or phase of the radiated energy. A change in either
phase or frequency of the energy causes it to leave the antenna at a different angle. Thus, the frequency or
