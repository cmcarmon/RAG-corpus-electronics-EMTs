Power ï¬‚ow studies are software tools that rely on steady-
state operation of the system to be studied. These software
tools use input data such as load type, load level (P, Q), and
circuit data (e.g., impedance, connection diagram). The out-
put is typically all nodal voltages and all line currents at all
frequencies.
