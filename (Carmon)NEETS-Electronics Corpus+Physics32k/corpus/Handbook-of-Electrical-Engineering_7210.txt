Scanning
Before transmission of the facsimile signal, the subject copy must be scanned. This involves the sensing of the
diffuse reﬂectances of light from the elemental areas making up the subject copy. For CCITT Group 3 high-
resolution  facsimile,  these  elemental  areas  are  rectangles  1/208  inch  wide  by  1/196  inch  high.  The  signal
corresponding to an elemental area is called a pixel which stands for picture element. For pixels that can assume
only one of two possible states (i.e., white on black or vice versa), the term used is a pel. Various arrangements
of  illuminating  sources,  light-sensing  transducers,  and  mechanical  scanning  methods  can  be  employed.  For
more than six sweeps per second across the subject copy, electronic scanning utilizing a cathode-ray tube or
photosensitive arrays or laser sources with polygon mirrors are utilized. A photosensitive array arrangement
for  scanning  a  ﬂood-illuminated  subject  copy  is  illustrated  in  Fig.  75.2.  This  is  the  most  often  encountered
scanning mechanism for modern facsimile scanners, and the sensors are typically silicon photosensitive devices.
Two photosensor arrays in common use are photodiode arrays and charge-coupled device linear image sensors.
For digital facsimile, the array is composed of 1728 sensors in a row 1.02 inches long with the optics designed
so that an 8.5 inch subject copy can be scanned.
