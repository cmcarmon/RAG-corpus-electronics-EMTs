The ﬁrst problem involves the relatively straightforward task
of determining a measure of similarity between sets of features
resulting from the analysis of two frames of speech. When
features composing the feature vectors represent uncorrelated
pieces of information with similar scales (e.g., outcomes of
uncorrelated random variables with equal variances), then the
widely used Euclidean distance is an appropriate measure of
similarity between the vectors. Such is the case, for example,
with cepstral coefﬁcients because the parameters are coefﬁ-
cients of a Fourier series and, therefore, represent an expansion
on an orthogonal set of basis functions. Determining the
‘‘distance’’ between (models represented by) two sets of LP
parameters, however, is a common task for which the Euclid-
ean distance is not appropriate because the LP parameters are
highly correlated. For this problem, some variation of the
Itakura distance measure (Itakura, 1975) (discussed next) is
often used.
