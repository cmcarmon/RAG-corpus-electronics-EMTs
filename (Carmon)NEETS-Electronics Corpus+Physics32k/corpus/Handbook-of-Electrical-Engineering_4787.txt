Perhaps  the  least  understood  and  to  some  extent  still  unsolved  problem  is  that  of  fatigue.  In  nonvolatile
memory applications the polarization represents the memory state of the material (up ” bit 1; down ” bit 0).
In use the device can be switched at the clock rate, say 100 MHz. Thus for a lifetime of 5 years the material
must withstand .1016 polarization reversals or large ﬁeld reversals. Typical materials for ferroelectric applica-
tions are PZTs with the ratio of zirconium to titanium adjusted to yield the maximum dielectric constant and
polarization. This maximum will be near the morphotropic phase boundary for PZT. Small quantities of other
materials  can  be  added,  such  as  lanthanum  or  niobium  to  modify  optical  or  switching  characteristics.  The
Sol-Gel method discussed below is particularly suitable for incorporating these additives. Devices made from
materials at the current state of the art loose a signiﬁcant portion of their polarization after 1010 to 1012 cycles,
rendering them useless for their intended memory use because of the associated signal loss. This is a topic of
intensive  investigation  and  only  one  proprietary  material  has  emerged  which  might  be  suitable  for  memory
use (Symetric Corporation). High epsilon nonferroelectric materials are of great interest for DRAM applica-
tions.  As  an  example,  major  efforts  are  extant  to  produce  thin  ﬁlms  of  mixtures  of  barium  and  strontium
titanate (BST). Dielectric constants of 600 and above have been achieved (compared to 4–6 for silicon oxides
and nitrides).
