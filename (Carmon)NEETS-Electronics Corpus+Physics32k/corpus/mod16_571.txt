As in most conventional electron tubes, the cathode is indirectly heated and emits a cloud of
electrons. The control grid is a hollow metal tube placed over the cathode. A small opening is located in
the center of a baffle at the end opposite the cathode. The control grid is maintained at a negative potential
with respect to the cathode to keep the electrons bunched together.
