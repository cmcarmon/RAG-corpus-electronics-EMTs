In the Netherlands there is no limit to the power of an air rifle. Anyone above the age of 18 can legally buy one.
However, in order to comply with the World Field Target Federation rules (as well as to limit damage to the targets), Field Target in the Netherlands is shot with rifles with a maximum muzzle energy of 16.3 Joule (12 ft/lbs).
