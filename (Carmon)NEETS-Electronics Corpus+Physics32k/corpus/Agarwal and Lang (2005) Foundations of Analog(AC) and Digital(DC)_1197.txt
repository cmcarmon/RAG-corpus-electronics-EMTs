e x e r c i s e 8.1 Consider the amplifier shown in Figure 8.49. The MOSFET oper-
ates in its saturation region and is characterized by the parameters VT and K. The
input voltage vI comprises the sum of a DC bias voltage VI and a sinusoid of the form
vi = A sin(Ï‰t). Assume that A is very small compared to VI. Let the output voltage vO
comprise a DC bias term VO and a small-signal response term vo.
