Optimizations can be achieved by facing the power problem
from different perspectives: design and technology. Enhanced
design capabilities mostly impact switching and short-circuit
power; technology improvements, on the other hand, contrib-
ute to reductions of all three components (Benini et al., 2001).
From a design perspective, circuit designers can choose from
a number of options to reduce the power dissipation ranging
from the highest levels of abstraction (architecture level) to
the lowest levels of abstraction (physical or technology level)
(Alidina et al., 1994). In each level of abstraction, there exists
a number of techniques that can be employed to effectively
reduce the power dissipation of CMOS circuits, all of which
can be obtained from the power dissipation equations men-
tioned in the previous section. As each technique has its own
ﬁgure of merit, it usually affects one or more aspect of the
system being optimized. As such, attempts are always being
made to ﬁnd a compromise that can effectively present a fair
and reasonable solution among conﬂicting objectives like
power dissipation and performance, where improving one
generally means degrading the other!
