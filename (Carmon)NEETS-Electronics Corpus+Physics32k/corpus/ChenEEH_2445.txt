Once the electric Ô¨Åeld is obtained, then basic antenna param-
eters can be derived using steps similar to those used for a
small dipole antenna (Das, 2004). The radiated power is
obtained by integrating the power-density function over the
sphere, as usual, from which the radiation resistance can be
derived. The necessary spherical integration involving equa-
tion 6.152 cannot be easily expressed in closed form, requiring
numerical integration.
