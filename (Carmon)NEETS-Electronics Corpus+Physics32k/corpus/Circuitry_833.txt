This  chapter  deals  with  the  techniques  used  to 
produce  a  working  circuit  from  an  initial  ‘paper 
design’  to  a  working  circuit  ready  for  testing  and 
performance  measurement.  Various  methods  are 
used  for  building  electronic  circuits.  The  method 
that’s  actually  chosen  for  a  particular  application 
depends  on  a  number  of  factors,  including  the 
available resources and the scale of production.     
  Techniques  used 
large-scale  electronic 
manufacture  generally  involve  fully  automated 
assembly  using  equipment 
that  can  produce 
complex circuits quickly and accurately and at very 
low cost with minimal human intervention. On the 
other extreme, if only one circuit is to be built then 
a hand-built  prototype  is  much  more  appropriate. 
It’s  also  worth  noting  that,  when  a  circuit  is 
designed  for  a  commercial  application  it  will 
invariably  be  tested  using  computer  simulation 
techniques before a prototype is manufactured (see 
Chapter  17).  It’s  also  possible  for  the  computer 
simulation to output data that can be used by CNC 
equipment  to  manufacture  a  printed  circuit  board 
on which the real circuit will be assembled. These 
techniques  have  been  instrumental  in  significantly 
reducing 
to  get  a  prototype 
electronic circuit off the computer screen and into 
production. 
  We  begin  with  a  quick  introduction  to  the 
different  methods  of  circuit  construction  before 
looking  in  greater  detail  at  the  stages  involved  in 
the  layout  and  manufacture  of  stripboards  and 
printed  circuit  boards.  Consideration  is  also  given 
to the correct choice of enclosure and connectors as 
this  is  crucial  in  making  the  finished  equipment 
both  functional  and  attractive.  The  chapter  also 
deals  with  soldering  and  desoldering  techniques 
and the selection of heatsinks.
