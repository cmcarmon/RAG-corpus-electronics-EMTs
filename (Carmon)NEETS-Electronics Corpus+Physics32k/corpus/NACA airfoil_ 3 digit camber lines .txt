3 digit camber lines provide a very far forward location for the maximum camber.
The first digit is 2/3 of the design lift coefficient (in 10ths).
The second digit is twice the longitudinal location of the maximum camber location (in 10ths).
The third digit indicates a non-reflexed (0) or reflexed (1) trailing edge.
