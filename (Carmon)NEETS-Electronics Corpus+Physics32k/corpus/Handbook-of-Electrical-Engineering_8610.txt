As you look at Fig. 87.3, undoubtedly you will prefer big-endian, but that is
only because it appeals to your prejudices. In truth, either works well. What is
important  is  that  you  be  able  to  direct  your  program  to  go  fetch  the  item  of
choice. In both systems, you use the lowest-numbered byte to indicate the item
of choice. Thus, for the number 01020304, the address will be 13. For the big-endian system, 13 will point to
the byte containing 04 and for the little-endian system, it will point at the byte containing 01.
