There  are  a  large  number  of  materials  which  are  currently  being  used  for  SAW  devices.  The  most  popular
). The
single-crystal piezoelectric materials are quartz, lithium niobate (LiNbO
3
materials are anisotropic, which will yield different material properties versus the cut of the material and the
direction of propagation. There are many parameters which must be considered when choosing a given material
for a given device application. Table 47.2 shows some important material parameters for consideration for four
of the most popular SAW materials [Datta, 1986; Morgan, 1985].
