One final type of summing amplifier is the SCALING AMPLIFIER. This circuit multiplies each
input by a factor (the factor is determined by circuit design) and then adds these values together. The
factor that is used to multiply each input is determined by the ratio of the feedback resistor to the input
resistor. For example, you could design a circuit that would produce the following output from three
inputs (E1, E2, E3):
