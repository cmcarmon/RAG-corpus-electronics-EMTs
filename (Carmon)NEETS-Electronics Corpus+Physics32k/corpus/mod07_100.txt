In the theory just described, two current carriers were created by the breaking of covalent bonds: the
negative electron and the positive hole. These carriers are referred to as electron-hole pairs. Since the
semiconductor we have been discussing contains no impurities, the number of holes in the electron-hole
pairs is always equal to the number of conduction electrons. Another way of describing this condition
where no impurities exist is by saying the semiconductor is INTRINSIC. The term intrinsic is also used to
distinguish the pure semiconductor that we have been working with from one containing impurities.
