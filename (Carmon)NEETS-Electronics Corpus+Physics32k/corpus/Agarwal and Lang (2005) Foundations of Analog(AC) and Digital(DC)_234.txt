In general, we can discretize values into any number of levels, for exam-
ple, four. Thus the representation discussed thus far is a special case of value
discretization called the binary representation where we discretize the voltage
(or current for that matter) into two information levels: ‘‘0’’ and ‘‘1.’’ Because
systems using more than two levels are difficult to build, most digital systems in
use today use the binary representation. Accordingly, the digital representation
has become synonymous with the binary representation.
