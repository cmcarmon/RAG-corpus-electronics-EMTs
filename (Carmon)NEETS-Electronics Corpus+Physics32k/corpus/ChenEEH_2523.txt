A multisection impedance matching network is described in
Figure 7.11, in which the sections may be equal or not equal to
quarter-wavelengths. Broadband matching condition can be
achieved with adequate design schemes, such as Chebyshev
synthesis techniques. The matching bandwidth can be enlarged
if the number of sections increases. Of course, in most prac-
tical cases, the limit is given by the maximum circuit area and
loss considerations.
