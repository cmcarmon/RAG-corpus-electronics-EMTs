Considering Example 2, the advantage of separating levels of concern may appear to be subtle. The reason
is the small size of the original sort program. A quote by B. Stroustrup [1991] emphasizes this point, “You can
make a small program (less than 1000 lines) work through brute force even when breaking every rule of good
style. For a larger program, this is simply not so. . . .” Advantages that do not seem very signiﬁcant for small
programs  become  invaluable  for  large  ones.  Writing  large  programs  is  an  inherently  difﬁcult  activity  that
demands a high level of concentration, helped by separating and hindered by mixing unrelated levels of concern.
Second, as a rule of thumb, the text of a procedure should ﬁt onto one page (or into a window). A single
page of text can be studied exclusively by eye movement and, thus, comprehended more easily than text that
spans  over  several  pages.  That  is  not  to  say  that  longer  procedures  are  necessarily  an  indication  of  poor
programming methods, but there should be compelling reasons if the limit of one page is to be exceeded.
