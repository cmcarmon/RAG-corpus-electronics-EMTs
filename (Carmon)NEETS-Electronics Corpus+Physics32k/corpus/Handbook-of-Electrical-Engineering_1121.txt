Of particular note is the Kaiser window where I0(.) is the 0th-order modiﬁed Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind
and  b  is  a  shape  parameter.  The  proper  choice  of  N  and  b  allows  the  designer  to  meet  given  passband
ripple/stopband attenuation and transition bandwidth speciﬁcations. Speciﬁcally, using S, the stopband atten-
uation in dB, the ﬁlter order must satisfy
