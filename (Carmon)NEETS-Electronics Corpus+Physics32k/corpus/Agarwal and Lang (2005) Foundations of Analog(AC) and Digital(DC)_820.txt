6. When fabricated on a VLSI chip, the physical MOSFET itself is symmetric with respect to
the drain and source. (Note, however, discrete MOSFET devices suitable for use on a bread-
board are not symmetric.) So its drain and source labels can be interchanged without changing the
device. Accordingly, if the drain and source nomenclature was unrelated to the potential difference
between the two terminals, the MOSFET characteristic would look like as in the adjacent figure.
As depicted, there is an open circuit between D and S when vGS < VT, and a short circuit when
vGS â‰¥ VT. When the open circuit exists, vDS can take on any value (positive or negative) as deter-
mined by external circuit constraints. Similarly, when the short circuit exists, iDS is unconstrained.
Interestingly, notice here that the model we choose for an element depends on the way we use the
element as much as on the physical construction of the element!
