The Physical Layer
Since the physical layer provides the most primitive services to LAN users, this layer is most closely associated
with the implementation technology of the LAN. At a fundamental level the transmission media can be either
electrical or optical waveguides. The physical media can be laid out as one of those topologies illustrated in
Fig.  72.9.  However,  certain  media  are  better  suited  to  some  topologies,  e.g.,  the  bus  is  frequently  used  with
electrical but not with optical media, because there is high insertion loss associated with taps in the latter.
