Unfortunately, for such large blocks, the probability of multiple-bit errors can exceed the number of
single-bit errors unless the channel single-bit error probability pe is very small. Consequently, we need to
enhance the codeâ€™s error correcting capability by adding double as well as single-bit error correction.
