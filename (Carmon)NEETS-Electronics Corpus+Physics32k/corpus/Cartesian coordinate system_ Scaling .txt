An example of an affine transformation which is not a Euclidean motion is given by scaling. To make a figure larger or smaller is equivalent to multiplying the Cartesian coordinates of every point by the same positive number m. If (x, y) are the coordinates of a point on the original figure, the corresponding point on the scaled figure has coordinates




(

x
′

,

y
′

)
=
(
m
x
,
m
y
)
.


{\displaystyle (x',y')=(mx,my).}

If m is greater than 1, the figure becomes larger; if m is between 0 and 1, it becomes smaller.
