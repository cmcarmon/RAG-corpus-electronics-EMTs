The cutback method for measuring multimode fiber attenuation is EIA/TIA-455-46. The cutback
method for measuring single mode fiber attenuation is EIA/TIA-455-78. The basic measurement process
is the same for both of these procedures. The test method requires that the test fiber of known length (L)
be cut back to an approximate 2-m length. This cut back causes the destruction of 2-m of fiber. This
method requires access to both fiber ends. Each fiber end should be properly prepared to make
measurements. EIA/TIA-455-57 describes how to properly prepare fiber ends for measurement purposes.
