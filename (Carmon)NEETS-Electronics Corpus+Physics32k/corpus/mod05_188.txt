The interpole coil in a motor is connected to carry the armature current the same as in a generator. 
As the load varies, the interpole flux varies, and commutation is automatically corrected as the load 
changes. It is not necessary to shift the brushes when there is an increase or decrease in load. The brushes 
are located on the no-load neutral plane. They remain in that position for all conditions of load.
