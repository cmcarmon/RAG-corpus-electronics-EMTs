(iii) real and reactive power ﬂow modiﬁcations; (iv) islanding; (v) synchronization during system restoration;
(vi) transients; (vii) protection issues; (viii) load following capability; and (ix) dynamic interation with the rest
of the system. Since there are very few systems with high penetration of DG, studies based on detailed models
should be undertaken to forecast potential problems and arrive at suitable solutions.
