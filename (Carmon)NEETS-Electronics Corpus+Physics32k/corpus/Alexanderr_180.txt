The  two  circuits  in  Fig.  4.15  are  equivalent—provided  they  have  the
same  voltage-current  relation  at  terminals 
It  is  easy  to  show  that
they are indeed equivalent. If the sources are turned off, the equivalent
resistance  at  terminals  a-b in  both  circuits  is  R. Also,  when  terminals
are short-circuited, the short-circuit current ﬂowing from a to b is
a-b

for the circuit
on the right-hand side. Thus, 
in order for the two circuits to
be equivalent. Hence, source transformation requires that
