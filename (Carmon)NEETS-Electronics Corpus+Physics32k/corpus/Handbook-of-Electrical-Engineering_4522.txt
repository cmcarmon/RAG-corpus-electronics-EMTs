Note  that  D  is  the  number  of  spatial  dimensions  in  the  problem  and  is  not  necessarily  the  sampling  dimensionality  d.  The
distinction is important because when an appropriate Green’s function is available, the source integrals are usually one dimension
less than the problem dimension, i.e., d =  D – 1. An exception is an inhomogeneous, penetrable body where d = D when using an
IE. We also assume for simplicity that matrix solution is achieved via factorization rather than iteration but that banded matrices
are  exploited  for  the  DE  approach  where  feasible.  The  solution-time  dependencies  given  can  thus  be  regarded  as  upper-bound
estimates. See Table 45.10 for further discussion of linear-system solutions.
