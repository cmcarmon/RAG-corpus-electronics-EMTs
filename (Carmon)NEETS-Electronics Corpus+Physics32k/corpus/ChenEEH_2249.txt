Capacitance is deﬁned as the ratio of the charge stored (or
separated) to the potential difference between the conductors.
(In the case of only one conductor, the point at inﬁnity serves
as the second conductor.) Ignoring fringing in a parallel plate
capacitor means the charge distribution is uniform throughout
the plates. Since s ¼ Q=A, and the D ﬁeld near a charged
plane is s=2, the total D ﬁeld between the two plates is s.
Therefore, E is s=e and is practically uniform. The potential
difference is then the integral of this nearly uniform E from
one plate to the other, or V ¼ Ed. Dividing Q by V, the
equation 2.45 is obtained.
