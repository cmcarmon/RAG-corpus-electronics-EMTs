A simple circuit model for a specific type of MOSFET device called the
n-channel MOSFET is depicted in Figure 6.10.3 This model based on the
simple switch is called the MOSFETâ€™s Switch Model, or S Model for short.4
The device is in the ON state when vGS crosses a threshold voltage VT,
otherwise it is off. A typical value for VT for n-channel MOSFETs is 0.7 volts,
but it can be varied by the manufacturing process.5 In the ON state, the S model
approximates the connection between the drain and the source as a short circuit.
In practice, there is some nonzero resistance between the drain and the source,
