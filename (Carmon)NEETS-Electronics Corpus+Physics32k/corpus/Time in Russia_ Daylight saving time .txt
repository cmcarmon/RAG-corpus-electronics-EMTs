Daylight saving time in Russia was originally introduced on 30 June [13 July, N.S.] 1917 by a decree of the Russian Provisional Government. However, it was abandoned by a Decree of the Soviet government five months later.
Daylight saving time was re-introduced in the USSR on 1 April 1981, by a decision of the Council of Ministers of the USSR. Daylight saving time began on 1 April and ended on 1 October each year, until mid-1984, when the USSR began following European daylight saving time rules, moving clocks forward one hour at 02:00 local standard time on the last Sunday in March, and back one hour at 03:00 local daylight time on the last Sunday in September until 1995, after which the change back occurred on the last Sunday in October. The usage of daylight saving time continued after the Soviet collapse but ended in 2011, when Russia stopped observing daylight saving time.
On 27 March 2011, clocks were advanced as usual, but they did not go back on 30 October 2011, effectively making Moscow Time UTC+04:00 permanently. On 26 October 2014, following another change in the law, the clocks in most of the country were moved back one hour, but summer Daylight Time was not reintroduced; Moscow Time returned to UTC+03:00 permanently. Since this reform, most Russian territories have a standard time ahead of mean solar time, including time in some cities ahead it even by one hour. For example, St. Petersburg at 30°E [+2h (*solar time)] has UTC+03:00, Yekaterinburg at 60°E (+4h*) has UTC+05:00, and Vladivostok at 132°E (+9h*) has UTC+10:00.
