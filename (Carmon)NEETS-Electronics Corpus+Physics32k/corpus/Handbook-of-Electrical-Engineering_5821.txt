The  subtransmission  system  connects  the  high-voltage  substations  to  the  distribution  substations.  These
stations  are  directly  in  the  load  centers.  For  example,  in  urban  areas,  the  distance  between  the  distribution
stations is around 5 to 10 miles. The typical voltage of the subtransmission system is between 138 and 69 kV.
In high load density areas, the subtransmission system uses a network conÔ¨Åguration that is similar to the high-
voltage  network.  In  medium  and  low  load  density  areas,  the  loop  or  radial  connection  is  used.  Figure  65.1
shows a typical radial connection.
