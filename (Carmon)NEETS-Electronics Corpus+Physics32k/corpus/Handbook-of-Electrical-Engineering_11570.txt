Deafness  is  often  brought  on  (or  occurs  congenitally)  by  damage  to  the  cochlea.  The  cochlea  normally
transduces variations in sound pressure intensity at a given frequency into patterns of neural discharge. This
neural code is then carried by the auditory (eighth cranial) nerve to the brainstem, where it is preprocessed
and  relayed  to  the  auditory  cortex  for  initial  processing  and  on  to  the  parietal  and  other  cortical  areas  for
information extraction. Similar to the case for the visual system, the cochlea, auditory nerve, auditory cortex,
and all relays in between maintain a topological map, this time based on tone frequency (tonotopic). If deafness
is solely due to cochlear damage (as is often the case) and if the auditory nerve is still intact, a cochlear implant
can often be substituted for the regular transducer array (the cochlea) while still sending the signal through
the normal auditory channel (to maintain modality speciÔ¨Åcity).
