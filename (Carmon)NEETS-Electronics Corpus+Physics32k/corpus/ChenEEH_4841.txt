The following example illustrates how middleware can be
used to facilitate control system integration and evolution of
the system as new hardware components or new software
algorithms become available. Consider the ï¬‚ight control
example introduced in Figure 14.2. This control system is
shown in Figure 14.4 integrated into a publish/subscribe
model. The publishing components (those that produce
data) are shown with arrows pointing away from them, and
the subscribing components (those that require data) are
shown with arrows pointing toward them. Note that some
components are both publishers and subscribers.
