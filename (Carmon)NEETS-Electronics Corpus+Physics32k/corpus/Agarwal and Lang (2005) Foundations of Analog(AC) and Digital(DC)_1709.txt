Finally, suppose that we wish to find the details of iL and vC during the nth ringing
period in which switch S1 is off and switch S2 is on. In this case, we use Equations 12.21
and 12.22 with one modification and several substitutions. The modification is that the
sign of iL in both equations must be reversed since iL is defined in opposite directions
in Figures 12.6 and 12.11. The substitutions are −VT/L for iL(0), vC[n] for vC(0), and
t − T for t since t = 0 occurs at the beginning of a cycle when switch S1 closes.
