Preinsulated Copper Terminal Lugs and Splicesâ€”The most common method of terminating and 
splicing copper wires is with the use of preinsulated terminal lugs and splices. Besides not having to 
insulate the terminal or splice after the crimping operation, the other advantage of this type is that it gives 
extra wire insulation support. Several types of crimping tools can be used for these types of terminals and 
splices. The tool varies with the size of the terminal or splice. Preinsulated terminal lugs and splices are 
color coded to indicate the wire size they are to be used with.
