At 12:54, Flight 7628 took off from Voronezh airport on the last leg of a domestic scheduled route from Chelyabinsk to Voronezh, then to Kishinev.
At 13:11, Flight 7880 departed Donetsk airport bound for Minsk.
At 13:17:15, Flight 7628 contacted ATC to report it was at flight level (FL) 8400 meters and requested permission to climb to FL 9600 meters. Flight 7628 also informed ATC it would reach the Volchansk waypoint at 13:22 and the Krasnohrad waypoint at 13:28, but controller Zhukovsky incorrectly recorded 13:19 to 13:26 respectively, which placed the aircraft ahead of schedule.
At 13:21:43, Flight 7628 re-contacted the ATC center and again requested permission to climb up to 9600 meters, but Zhukovsky rejected that request.
At 13:25:48, Flight 7880 bound for Minsk, informed ATC they had departed Donetsk 14 minutes before and were at 5700 meters, and that they would reach the Dnepropetrovsk waypoint at 13:34 and the Kremenchug waypoint at 13:44. Zhukovsky confirmed the location of the aircraft and ordered them to climb to and maintain 7,200 meters.
At 13:27:50, Flight 7628 contacted ATC and reported that they were over Krasnohrad at FL 8400 meters. Flight 7628 then asked controller Zhukovsky for their ground speed and the speed of another Tu-134A identified as 65132, flying at FL 9600 meters. Flight 7628 was flying at 830 km/h and aircraft 65132 was at 750 km/h. Because of the speed difference ATC refused to let flight 7628 climb to 9600 meters. Flight 7628 confirmed the instructions, although they tried to clarify that they could also slow down after the climb. This was the last radio transmission from Flight 7628.
At 13:30:40, Flight 7880 contacted ATC and reported they were at 7200 meters, 25 kilometers away from the Dnepropetrovsk beacon. The controller confirmed their position and instructed them to climb to an altitude of 8400 meters. After 3 minutes (13:34:52) Flight 7880 reported at an altitude of 8400 meters, at the Dnipropetrovsk the beacon. Controller Zhukovsky initially incorrectly identified the aircraft on radar and, when he properly identified it, he realized that it was on a collision course with another aircraft (CCCP-86676 – an Ilyushin Il-62 at 9000 meters.) and therefore instructed Flight 7880 to stay at 8400 meters, which was confirmed.
Flight 7628 was flying on Airway 50 (Magdalinovka – Ball, course 201°) and Flight 7880 was on Airway 147 corridor (Dnepropetrovsk – Kremenchug, course 300°). These corridors intersect at an angle of 99° north-east of Dneprodzerzhinsk. Because of previous errors, the controllers perception of the location of each aircraft was incorrect. When Zhukovsky's supervisor Sumy overheard the radio traffic and saw the aircraft converging on the radar screen he realized the catastrophic situation and attempted to correct it. At 13:34:07 controller Sumy ordered aircraft 86676 (IL-62) from 9000 meters to 9600 meters. At 13:34:21 Sumy repeated the order then directed Flight 7880 from 8400 meters to the now vacant altitude at 9000 meters.
13:34:07 ATC to aircraft 86676 "Take 9600."
13:34:21 ATC to aircraft 86676 "Take 9600."
13:34:23 ATC to Flight 7880 "and you take a 9. Over 8400 Dneprodzerzhinsk crossover."
13:34:25 aircraft 86676 to ATC "9600."
13:34:33 (inaudible.) "Got it ... 8400"
The controller heard a muffled reply and assumed it was an acknowledgement from Flight 7880, but the muffled transmission was actually from aircraft 86676 and Flight 7880 remained at 8400 meters.
