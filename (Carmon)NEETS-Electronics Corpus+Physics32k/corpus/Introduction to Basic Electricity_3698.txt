Figure 36-28 shows a circuit that limits current 
through the series regulator transistor. It is shown added 
to the feedback series voltage regulator. Transistor Q3 
and resistor R6 form the current-limiting circuit. In order 
for transistor Q3 to conduct, the base-to-emitter junction 
must be forward biased by a minimum of 0.7 volt. When
