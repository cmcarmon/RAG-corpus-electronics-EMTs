The limitations associated with the DAC in a successive-approximation ADC can be avoided
by using the analog method of charging a capacitor with a constant current; the time required
to charge the capacitor from zero to the voltage of the input signal becomes the digital
output. When charged by a constant current the voltage on a capacitor is a linear function
