As the pressure builds rapidly in relation to depth, underground mining operations require a fairly complex water system with pressure reducing valves. These devices must be installed at a certain distance interval, usually 600 feet (180 m). Without such valves, pipes would easily burst and pressure would be too great for equipment operation.
