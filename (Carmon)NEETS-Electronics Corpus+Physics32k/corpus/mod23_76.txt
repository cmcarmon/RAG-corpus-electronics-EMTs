Oxide particles that can be magnetized are coated onto the base material. The most common
magnetic particles used are either gamma ferric oxide or chromium dioxide. It’s very important that these
magnetic particles are uniform in size. If they’re not, the tape’s surface will be abrasive and will reduce the
life of the recorder’s magnetic heads.
