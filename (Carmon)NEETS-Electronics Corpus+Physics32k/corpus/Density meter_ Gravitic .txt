Gravitic density meters work on the principle of gravity to calculate the density of a sample. A flexible hose is used to determine the change in weight. Using the principle of beam deflection of two fixed ends, the weight can be calculated. Increases in weight result in a larger deflection. Decreases in weight result in a smaller deflection. The volume inside of the hose never changes. Since the volume is constant and the weight is known, the density is easily calculated from this information.
Displacement is measured with a high precision displacement laser. Micron scale deflections can be read by the density meter. Minute changes in weight are seen at this scale.
The entire volume is measured using gravitic methods. This means that the sample size is the entire volume of what needs to be measured.
Gravitic density meters use the least amount of theory, making them the most accurate choice, depending on the application. Using the equation

{\displaystyle \rho ={\frac {m}{V}}}
the volume is known, once we find the mass, we can find the density.
