modes that are degenerated (have the same resonant fre-
quency). Application of a bias Ô¨Åeld will remove this mode
degeneracy with two resonant modes having slightly different
resonant frequencies, which are referred to as mode splitting.
The operating frequency of the circulator can then be chosen
between the two resonant frequencies so that the superposition
of those two modes add at the output port and cancel out at
the isolated port. A similar operating principle is also applied
to the waveguide Y-junction circulator.
