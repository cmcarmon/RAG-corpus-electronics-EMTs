When measuring resistors, you will find situations in which the quantities to be measured may be
extremely large, and the resulting number using the basic unit, the ohm, may prove too cumbersome.
Therefore, a metric system prefix is usually attached to the basic unit of measurement to provide a more
manageable unit. Two of the most commonly used prefixes are kilo and mega. Kilo is the prefix used to
represent thousand and is abbreviated k. Mega is the prefix used to represent million and is abbreviated
M.
