The  essential  feature  of  a  liquid  crystal  is  the  long  rod-like  molecule.  In  a  nematic  crystal,  the  molecules
align as shown in Fig. 83.12. If the container surface is microscopically grooved, the interface molecules will
be  aligned  by  the  grooves  and  intermolecular  forces  will  maintain  that  orientation  across  the  liquid  crystal
[Fig. 83.12(a)]. The molecules will align in an electric ﬁeld, and beyond a critical value, the ﬁeld may be sufﬁcient
to overcome the alignment with the grooves [Fig. 83.12(b)]. (In practice, the transition is not so abrupt, and
groove alignment persists at the interface itself [Fig. 83.13].)
