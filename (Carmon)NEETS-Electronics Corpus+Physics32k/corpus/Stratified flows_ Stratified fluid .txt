A stratified fluid may be defined as the fluid with density variations in the vertical direction. For example, air and water; both are fluids and if we consider them together then they can be seen as a stratified fluid system. Density variations in the atmosphere profoundly affect the motion of water and air. Wave phenomena in air flow over the mountains and occurrence of smog are the examples of stratification effect in the atmosphere. When a fluid system having a condition in which fluid density decreases with height, is disturbed, then the gravity and friction restore the undisturbed conditions. If however the fluid tends to be stable if density decreases with height.
