Consider a vessel maintained at a constant temperature

, containing a homogeneous reacting mixture. Let the characteristic size of the vessel be



a


{\displaystyle a}
. Since the mixture is homogeneous, the density



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
is constant. During the initial period of ignition, the consumption of reactant concentration is negligible (see

{\displaystyle t_{f}}
and
