Using the z-parameter values found in Eqs. (3.63), (3.65), (3.67), and (3.70) and substituting into the network
characteristic  relationships  shown  in  the  last  column  of  Table 3.1,  assuming  ZS  =  20  W  and  ZL  =  10  W,  we
obtain Zin = 4.89 W, Zout = 4.32 W, Vg  = 0.252, Vgt  = 0.0494, and Ig = â€“0.123.
