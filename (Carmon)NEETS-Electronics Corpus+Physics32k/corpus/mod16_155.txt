Resistance measurements are a valuable aid to you in locating defective circuits and components
during corrective maintenance. Maintenance handbooks for the equipment can often be used to help you
take these measurements. These handbooks often contain resistance charts that are referenced to
accessible test points within the equipment. Without these charts, taking resistance measurements in a
complex circuit is a slow process. The process is slow because one side of the circuit component must
often be desoldered to get a true resistance measurement. However, resistance tolerances vary so widely
that approximate resistance readings are adequate for most jobs.
