Traces are detailed logs of program execution. Whenever a
meaningful event takes place, such as a message passed be-
tween two processes or the entry and exit of a procedure, the
event is logged and time-stamped. Analysis tools are then
heavily relied upon to extract some meaningful information
from these logs or to at least reduce the dimensionality of the
data such that visualization tools can be used to explore the
information present. The main disadvantage to the use of
traces is the huge amount of data that can be created; Foster
(1995) gives the example of a 20-byte record on every message
on a 128-processor system with messages produced every
10 ms. For this system, a volume of 1 GB of data would be
produced per hour. In addition to the storage and postproces-
sing requirements necessary,
logging this much data could
itself change performance signiÔ¨Åcantly.
