Trellis-Coded Modulation
Trellis-coded modulation (TCM) combines multilevel modulation and coding to achieve coding gain without
bandwidth expansion [Ungerboeck, 1982, 1987]. TCM has been adopted for use in the new CCITT V.32 modem
that allows an information data rate of 9600 b/s (bits per second) to be transmitted over VF (voice frequency)
lines. The TCM has a coding gain of 4 dB [Wei, 1984]. The combined modulation and coding operation of
TCM is shown in Fig. 70.5(b). Here, the serial data from the source, m(t), are converted into parallel (m-bit)
