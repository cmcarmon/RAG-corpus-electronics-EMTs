Now, look at the smaller schematic diagram in figure 3-7. Only three connections have been brought
out from the stator. Electrically, this is the same as the large diagram above it. Instead of being connected
at the output terminals, the B1-A2 connection was made internally when the stator was wired. A two-
phase alternator connected in this manner is called a two-phase, three-wire alternator.
