started or ending, which block has been taken after the branch,
and when a derived signature checking for each block is based
on the received instructions. Because which instruction in a
block that will be passed ﬁrst to the WD is not known a priori
(except that it will be one of the ﬁrst K instructions), the
derived signature is different for each of the K possibilities of
the ﬁrst instruction of the block seen by the WD. Thus, every
block must be assigned K signatures, each one for a different
possible alignment. The signature is concurrently computed by
the WD and compared with the K references stored in its
memory to verify the correctness of the fetches.
