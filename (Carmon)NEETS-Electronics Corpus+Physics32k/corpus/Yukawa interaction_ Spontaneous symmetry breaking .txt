Now suppose that the potential



V
(
ϕ
)


{\displaystyle V(\phi )}
has a minimum not at



ϕ
=
0


{\displaystyle \phi =0}
but at some non-zero value




ϕ

0




{\displaystyle \phi _{0}}
. This can happen, for example, with a potential form such as



V
(
ϕ
)
=

μ

2



ϕ

2


+
λ

ϕ

4




{\displaystyle V(\phi )=\mu ^{2}\phi ^{2}+\lambda \phi ^{4}}
with



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }
set to an imaginary value. In this case, the Lagrangian exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking. This is because the non-zero value of the



ϕ


{\displaystyle \phi }
field, when operated on by the vacuum, has a non-zero expectation called the vacuum expectation value of



ϕ


{\displaystyle \phi }
. In the Standard Model, this non-zero expectation is responsible for the fermion masses, as shown below.
To exhibit the mass term, the action can be re-expressed in terms of the derived field






ϕ
~



=
ϕ
−

ϕ

0




{\displaystyle {\tilde {\phi }}=\phi -\phi _{0}}
, where




ϕ

0




{\displaystyle \phi _{0}}
is constructed to be a constant independent of position. This means that the Yukawa term has a component




g

ϕ

0





ψ
¯



ψ


{\displaystyle g\phi _{0}{\bar {\psi }}\psi }

and since both g and




ϕ

0




{\displaystyle \phi _{0}}
are constants, this term resembles a mass term for a fermion with mass



g

ϕ

0




{\displaystyle g\phi _{0}}
. This mechanism, the Higgs mechanism, is the means by which spontaneous symmetry breaking gives mass to fermions. The field

{\displaystyle {\tilde {\phi }}}
is known as the Higgs field.
