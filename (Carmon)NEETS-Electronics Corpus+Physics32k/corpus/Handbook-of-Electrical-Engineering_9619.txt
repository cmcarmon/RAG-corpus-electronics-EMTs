To build a fault-tolerant system requires both hardware and software modiﬁcations. Let’s take a look at an
example of a small problem that illustrates the type of changes that must be made. Remember, the goal of such
a system is to achieve continuous operation. That means we can never purposely shut the computer off. How
then do we repair the system if we cannot shut it off? First, the hardware must be capable of having circuit
boards plugged and unplugged while the system is running; this is not possible on most computers. Second,
removing  a  board  must  be  detected  by  the  hardware  and  reported  to  the  operating  system.  The  operating
system, the manager of resources, must then discontinue use of that resource.
