To  make  use  of  the  new  service,  it  is  then  necessary  to  set “triggers”  in  the  appropriate  service  switching
point. These triggers can be set for both originating and terminating calls, and they represent events which,
should they occur, indicate the need for the switch to launch a query to the SCP for information the switch
needs to process the call. The AIN switch generics, which are presently deployed, support several triggers such
as “immediate off hook” or “called address.” Future AIN switch generics are expected to support several dozen
triggers. The ﬁrst phase of the AIN, called AIN 0, became reality in late 1991 when friendly user trials began
in two of the Regional Bell Operating Companies.
