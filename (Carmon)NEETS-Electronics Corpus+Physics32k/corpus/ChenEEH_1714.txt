where Rij is a binary random variable taking value 1 if the
concept i is present in frame j. During the training phase, the
identiﬁed concepts are given labels, and the corresponding
Multiject consists of a label along with its probability of occur-
rence and multimodal feature vector. Multijects are then inte-
grated at the frame level by deﬁning frame level features
Fi, i 2 {1 . . . N } (N is the number of concepts the system is
being trained for) in the same way they are for Rij. If M is the
number of
then given
w ¼ ~XX1, . . . ~XXM
, the conditional probability of Multiject i
being present in any region in the current frame is:
