Critical bands: Broadly  used  to  refer  to  psychoacoustic  phenomena  of  limited  frequency  resolution  in  the
cochlea. More speciÔ¨Åcally, the concept of critical bands evolved in experiments on the audibility of a tone
in noise of varying bandwidth, centered around the frequency of the tone. Increasing the noise bandwidth
beyond a certain critical value has little effect on the audibility of the tone.
