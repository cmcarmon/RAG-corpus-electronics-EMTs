Problems involving grounded or ﬂoating conductors in the
presence of sources can be solved by the method of images. In
this method, the total ﬁeld (potential and vector) of a charge in
the presence of a PEC object is obtained by ﬁnding the po-
sition of a ﬁctitious source of appropriate strength that, when
combined with the original source, would make the surface of
the PEC an equipotential. When the PEC is grounded, there is
usually only one oppositely charged image. When the PEC is
ﬂoating, conservation of charge demands that the total charge
over its surface remain zero. In that case, the image charges
form a dipole. Figure 2.7 summarizes the most common
source–conductor–image systems for both two-dimensional
and three-dimensional problems.
