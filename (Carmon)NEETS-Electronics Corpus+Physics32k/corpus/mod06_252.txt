Remember that the voltage gain of a circuit is measured by the ratio of the change in plate voltage to
the change in grid voltage. Because plate voltage is developed across a resistor, the more current varies
with a given input signal, the greater will be the output (E = I × R). If you have two tubes, one with a gm
of 500 mhos and the other with a gm of 500 PKRV��\RX�FDQ�HVWLPDWH�WKH�UHODWLYH�JDLQ�RI�WKHVH�WZR�WXEHV�
Assume that the circuit in which you wish to use one of these tubes has a load resistor of 100 kohms and
that ¨Eg will be 2 volts. The voltage gain of these two circuits will be:
