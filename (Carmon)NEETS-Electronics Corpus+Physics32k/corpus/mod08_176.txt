The bandwidth represents the amount or "width" of frequencies, or the "band of frequencies," that
the amplifier is MOST effective in amplifying. However, the bandwidth is NOT the same as the band of
frequencies that is amplified. The bandwidth (BW) of an amplifier is the difference between the
frequency limits of the amplifier. For example, the band of frequencies for an amplifier may be from 10
kilohertz (10 kHz) to 30 kilohertz (30 kHz). In this case, the bandwidth would be 20 kilohertz (20 kHz).
As another example, if an amplifier is designed to amplify frequencies between 15 hertz (15 Hz) and 20
kilohertz (20 kHz), the bandwidth will be equal to 20 kilohertz minus 15 hertz or 19,985 hertz (19,985
Hz). This is shown in figure 2-1.
