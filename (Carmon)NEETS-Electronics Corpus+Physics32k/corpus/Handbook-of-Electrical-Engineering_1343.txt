good
The  perception  of  “good  quality”  speech  is  a  highly  individual  and  subjective  area.  As  such,  no  single
performance  measure  has  gained  wide  acceptance  as  an  indicator  of  the  quality  and  intelligibility  of  speech
produced by a coder. Further, there is no substitute for subjective listening tests under the actual environmental
conditions  expected  in  a  particular  application. As  a  rough  guide  to  the  performance  of  some  of  the  coders
discussed  here,  we  present  the  DRT,  DAM,  and  MOS  values  in  Table  15.1,  which  is  adapted  from  [Spanias,
1994;  Jayant,  1990].  From  the  table,  it  is  evident  that  at  8  kbits/s  and  above,  performance  is  quite  good  and
that the 4.8 kbits/s CELP has substantially better performance than LPC-10e.
