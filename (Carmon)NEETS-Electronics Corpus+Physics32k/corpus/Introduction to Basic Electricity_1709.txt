Redraw the circuit again, substituting equivalent resistance 
RA for parallel resistors RS and R5, and determine the total 
series resistance for the redrawn circuit. See Figure 13-31.
Given 
RT  5 ?  
R1  5 2700 V 
RA 5 500 V 
R6  5 5600 V
The circuit shown in Figure 13-29 can be replaced with 
a single resistor of 8800 ohms (Figure 13-32).
