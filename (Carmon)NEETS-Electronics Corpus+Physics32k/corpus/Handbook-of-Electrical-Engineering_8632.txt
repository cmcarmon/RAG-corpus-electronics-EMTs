How different is the SPARC! The parameters to be passed are placed in the out registers (six are available
for this purpose). Only the overï¬‚ow, if any, would go on the stack. In general, registers are saved by window-
blinding rather than moving them to the stack. On return, data is returned in the in registers and the registers
restored by reverse window-blinding.
