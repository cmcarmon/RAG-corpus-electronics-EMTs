Now, if you stop the gyro top and turn its axis horizontal, and then start it spinning again, balancing 
one end on a pivot, (fig. 3-3), it won't fall. The top's axis will stay horizontal, resisting the tendency of 
gravity to change its direction Although the gyro will RESIST the force that gravity applies to it, the gyro 
will still RESPOND to that force. The gyro responds by moving its axis at a RIGHT ANGLE to the 
APPLIED FORCE.
