Photon Counting
For the detection of very low light levels and for measuring the statistical properties of light, photon counting
can be done using photomultipliers. A pulse of up to 108 electrons can be generated for each photoelectron
emitted  from  the  cathode,  and  so  the  arrival  of  individual  photons  can  be  detected.  There  is  a  considerable
ﬁeld of study into the statistical properties of light ﬁelds as measured by photon counting statistics.
