frequency that can be made adjustable by replacing  
R with a variable or preset resistor. 
  Assume  that  C is  initially  uncharged  and  the 
voltage  at  the  inverting  input  is  slightly  less  than 
the  voltage  at  the  non-inverting  input.  The  output 
voltage will rise rapidly to +VCC and the voltage at 
the inverting input will begin to rise exponentially 
as capacitor C charges through R.
