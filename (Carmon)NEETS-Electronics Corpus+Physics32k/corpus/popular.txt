Suppose we have to measure the distance between point µx and point µy, which are collinear with some point 0. Suppose further that we instructed this task to two independent and large groups of surveyors equipped with tape measures, wherein each surveyor of the first group will measure distance between 0 and µx and each surveyor of the second group will measure distance between 0 and µy.
Under the following assumptions we may consider the two sets of received observations xi, yj as random variables X and Y having normal distribution of the same variance σ 2 and distributed over "factual locations" of points µx, µy.
Calculating the arithmetic mean for all pairs |xi − yj| we should then obtain the value of L–K metric DNN(X, Y). Its characteristic curvilinearity arises from the symmetry of modulus and overlapping of distributions f(x), g(y) when their means approach each other.
An interesting experiment the results of which coincide with the properties of L–K metric was performed in 1967 by Robert Moyer and Thomas Landauer who measured the precise time an adult took to decide which of two Arabic digits was the largest. When the two digits were numerically distanced such as 2 and 9. subjects responded quickly and accurately. But their response time slowed by more than 100 milliseconds when they were closer such as 5 and 6, and subjects then erred as often as once in every ten trials. The distance effect was present both among highly intelligent persons, as well as those who were trained to escape it.
