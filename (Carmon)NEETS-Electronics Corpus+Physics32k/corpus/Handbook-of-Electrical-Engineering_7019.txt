where log2 100.1 = 0.33 and SNRdB is equal to the optimum signal-to-noise ratio (in dB) of a linear estimate of
a ï¬‚at input signal given the channel output signal. Such an optimum signal-to-noise ratio is equal to one plus
the power alloted to the input divided by the noise power in the channel band, i.e.,
