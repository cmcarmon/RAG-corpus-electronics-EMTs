PULSE-FREQUENCY MODULATION.â€”Pfm is a method of pulse modulation in which the
modulating wave is used to frequency modulate a pulse-generating circuit. For example, the pulse rate
may be 8,000 pulses per second (pps) when the signal voltage is 0. The pulse rate may step up to 9,000
pps for maximum positive signal voltage, and down to 7,000 pps for maximum negative signal voltage.
Figure 2-47, views (A), (B), and (C) show three typical waveforms for pfm. This method of modulation is
not used extensively because of complicated pfm generation methods. It requires a stable oscillator that is
frequency modulated to drive a pulse generator. Since the other forms of ptm are easier to achieve, they
are commonly used.
