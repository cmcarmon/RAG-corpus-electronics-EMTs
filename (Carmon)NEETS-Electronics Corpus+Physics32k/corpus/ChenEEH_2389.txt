It may be noted, depending on the speciÔ¨Åc application in
mind, that the desired radiation pattern may take many differ-
ent forms. In addition to the total power radiation pattern, one
may be interested in the theta- or phi-power patterns to evalu-
ate the polarization properties of radiation. The polarization
properties are discussed separately in the following section.
