Present and Future Trends
According to the Edison Electric Institute, electricity’s share of U.S. primary energy was almost
36% in 1989, and it is likely to reach 46% by the year 2010. The growth rate in the use of electric
energy in the United States is projected to increase by about 2.4% per year for the near future,
in spite of conservation practices, more efﬁcient use of electricity, and a slackening population
growth. One should also be aware of large growth of power systems internationally.
