(b) If the same machine is operated as a motor
supplied from a 400-V dc supply, and if the
motor is delivering 30 hp to the mechanical
load, determine: (i) the current taken from
the supply, (ii) the speed of the motor, and
(iii) the electromagnetic torque, if the Ô¨Åeld
current is maintained at 4 A. Assume that
the armature circuit resistance and the me-
chanical losses are negligible.
