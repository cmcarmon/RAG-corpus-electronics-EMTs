Physica B was created in 1975 as a result of the splitting of Physica in 1975. It is concerned with condensed matter physics and its applications, particularly solid state and low-temperature physics. Some conference proceedings are published in special editions of Physica B.
Physica B is published by Elsevier on an at-least monthly basis (12 times per year, sometimes more).
