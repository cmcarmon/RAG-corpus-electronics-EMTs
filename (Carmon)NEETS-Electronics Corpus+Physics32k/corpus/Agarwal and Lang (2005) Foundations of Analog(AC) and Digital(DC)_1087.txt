a) The fact that a second amplifier stage is connected to the first amplifier stage does
not change the operation of the first stage. That is, the relation between vMID and
vIN here is the same as the relation between vOUT and vIN in Problem 7.2. Why?
What terminal characteristic of the second MOSFET must change in order for this
not to be true?
