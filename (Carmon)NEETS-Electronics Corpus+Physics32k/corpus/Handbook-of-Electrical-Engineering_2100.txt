Probability is a measure, between zero and unity, of how likely an event is to occur. For a received wavefront
the  likelihood  ratio,  L,  is  the  ratio  of  PH1  (probability  that  hypothesis  H1  is  true)  to  PH0  (probability  that
hypothesis H0 is true). A decision (detection) is made by comparing the likelihood, or logarithm of the likelihood
ratio called the log-likelihood ratio, to a predetermined threshold h. That is, if L =  PH1/PH0 > h, a decision is
made that the signal is present.
