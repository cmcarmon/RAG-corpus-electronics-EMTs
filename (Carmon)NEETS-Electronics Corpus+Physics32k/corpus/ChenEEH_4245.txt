Fiber data distribution interface (FDDI) is an example of
MAN that is an ANSI X3T9.5 standard, proposed by the ANSI
XT9.5 study group. Each Ô¨Åeld in the MAC frame can either be
represented as a symbol (4 bits, for nondata) or in bits format
(data or address). The IEEE 802.5 token ring frame format is
similar to the FDDI frame format. The FDDI frame includes
a preamble to help in clocking because this is desirable for
high-speed communication. FDDI does not include an access
