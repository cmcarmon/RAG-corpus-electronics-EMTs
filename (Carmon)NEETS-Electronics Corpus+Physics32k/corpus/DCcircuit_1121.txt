Mercury standard cells were also susceptible to slight changes in voltage if physically or
thermally disturbed. Two different types of mercury standard cells were developed for differ-
ent calibration purposes: saturated and unsaturated. Saturated standard cells provided the
greatest voltage stability over time, at the expense of thermal instability. In other words, their
voltage drifted very little with the passage of time (just a few microvolts over the span of a
decade!), but tended to vary with changes in temperature (tens of microvolts per degree Cel-
sius). These cells functioned best in temperature-controlled laboratory environments where
long-term stability is paramount. Unsaturated cells provided thermal stability at the expense
of stability over time, the voltage remaining virtually constant with changes in temperature
but decreasing steadily by about 100 µV every year. These cells functioned best as ”ﬁeld” cali-
bration devices where ambient temperature is not precisely controlled. Nominal voltage for a
saturated cell was 1.0186 volts, and 1.019 volts for an unsaturated cell.
