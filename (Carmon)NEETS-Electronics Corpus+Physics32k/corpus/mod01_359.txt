In the pressed-powder cells, shown in figure 2-5 views B and C, the zinc powder for the anode is 
mixed prior to being pressed into shape. The absorbent shown in the figure is paper soaked in the 
electrolyte. The space between the inner and outer containers provides passage for any gas generated by 
an improper chemical balance or impurities present within the cell.
