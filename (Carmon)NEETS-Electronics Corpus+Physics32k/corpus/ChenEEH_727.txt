The rebalancing of the bandwidth load is again performed by
reordering the memory accesses (also across loop scopes).
Moreover, the overall cycle distribution for the loops has a
large impact on the peak bandwidth. Tool support is indispens-
able for this difﬁcult task. An accurate memory access ordering
is needed for deﬁning the needed memory architecture.
