In the area of analysis of resistive circuits, interesting and still
unresolved issues are: Does a given transistor circuit possess
exactly one, or more than one dc operating point? How many
operating points can it possess? What simple techniques can be
used to distinguish between those circuits having a unique
operating point and those capable of possessing more than
one? What can we say about the stability of an operating point?
How can circuit simulators be used to Ô¨Ånd all the solutions of
a given circuit? These and other issues have been and still are a
focal point of research in the area of nonlinear circuits.

many topics considered in this elementary review of nonlinear
circuits.
