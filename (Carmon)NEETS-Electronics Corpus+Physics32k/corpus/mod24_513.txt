The core-cladding concentricity error for multimode fibers is the distance between the core and
cladding centers divided by the core diameter. Multimode core-cladding concentricity error is expressed
as a percentage of core diameter. The core-cladding concentricity error for single mode fibers is defined
as the distance between the core and cladding centers.
