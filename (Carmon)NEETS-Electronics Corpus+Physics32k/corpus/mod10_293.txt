As the frequency of the radio wave is increased, the critical angle must be reduced for refraction to 
occur. This is illustrated in figure 2-18. The 2-megahertz wave strikes the layer at the critical angle for 
that frequency and is refracted back to Earth. Although the 5-megahertz wave (broken line) strikes the 
ionosphere at a lesser angle, it nevertheless penetrates the layer and is lost. As the angle is lowered from 
the vertical, however, a critical angle for the 5-megahertz wave is reached, and the wave is then refracted 
to Earth.
