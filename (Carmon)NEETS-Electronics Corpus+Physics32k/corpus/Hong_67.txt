The  unidirectional  conduction  through  a  diode  is  explained  by  semiconductor 
physics.    A  diode  is  a  junction  between  N-type  and  P-type  semiconductors,  typically 
fabricated  in  thin  layers  as  shown  in  Figure  6.3.  Both  N-type  and  P-type  materials  are 
electrically  neutral,  but  have  different  mechanisms  of  conduction.  In  N-type  material, 
negatively charged electrons are mobile and are the majority current carriers. In P-type 
material, positively charged holes are mobile are the majority current carriers. Holes are 
actually temporary positive charges created by the lack of an electron; the details of this 
interpretation  can  be  found  in  textbooks  on  semiconductor  physics  [Ref:  Sedra  and 
Smith].
