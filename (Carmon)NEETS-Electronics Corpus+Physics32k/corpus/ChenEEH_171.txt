A sketch of the pole-zero plot of some such lowpass ﬁlter
was shown in Figure 4.10. As always, the roots of the poly-
nomial must be in the left half of the plane. There are many
possibilities for selecting the zeros and poles, all beyond
the scope of this presentation. Fortunately, there exist numer-
ous
in literature. Best known are the
Cauer-parameter ﬁlters with equiripple responses
in the
passband and with equal minimal suppressions in the stop-
band. We have analyzed one such ﬁlter: see Figure 4.12
and its amplitude responses in Figures 4.13(A) through
4.13(D).
