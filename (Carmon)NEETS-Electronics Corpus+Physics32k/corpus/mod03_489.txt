Another type of switch can be LOCKED IN or OUT of some of the switch positions. This locking
prevents the accidental movement of the switch. If a switch has locked-in positions, the switch cannot be
moved from those positions accidentally (by the switch being bumped or mistaken for an unlocked
switch). If the switch has locked-out positions, the switch cannot be moved into those positions
accidentally. Figure 3-12 shows a three-position, locking switch.
