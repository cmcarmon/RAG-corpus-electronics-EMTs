The ﬁrst meter movements built were known as galvanometers, and were usually designed
with maximum sensitivity in mind. A very simple galvanometer may be made from a mag-
netized needle (such as the needle from a magnetic compass) suspended from a string, and
positioned within a coil of wire. Current through the wire coil will produce a magnetic ﬁeld
which will deﬂect the needle from pointing in the direction of earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. An antique
string galvanometer is shown in the following photograph:
