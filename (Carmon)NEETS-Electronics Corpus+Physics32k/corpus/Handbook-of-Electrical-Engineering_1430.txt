Several characteristics of a speech utterance may be determined by examination of the DFT magnitude. In
Fig. 15.10, the DFT of a voiced utterance contains a series of sharp peaks in the frequency domain. These peaks,
caused by the periodic sampling action of the glottal excitation, are separated by the fundamental frequency
which is about 141 Hz, in this example. In addition, broader peaks can be seen, for example at about 300 Hz
and at about 2300 Hz. These broad peaks, called formants, result from resonances in the vocal tract.
