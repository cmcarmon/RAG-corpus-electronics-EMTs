Here pn denotes the probability or relative frequency of occurrence of the nth symbol in the source alphabet,
and  log2(x)  =  ln(x)/ln(2)  is  the  base  2  logarithm  of  x.  The  units  of  H  are  bits/source  symbol.  The  proof  of
Shannon’s theorem is based on grouping the source symbols into large blocks and assigning binary code words
of varying length to each block of source symbols. More probable blocks of source symbols are assigned shorter
code  words,  whereas  less  probable  blocks  are  assigned  longer  code  words.  As  the  block  length  approaches
inﬁnity, the bit rate tends to H. Huffman determined the optimum variable-length coding scheme for a discrete
memoryless source using blocks of any ﬁnite length.
