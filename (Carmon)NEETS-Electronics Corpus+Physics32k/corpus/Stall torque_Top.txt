Stall torque is the torque produced by a mechanical device whose output rotational speed is zero. It may also mean the torque load that causes the output rotational speed of a device to become zero, i.e., to cause stalling. Electric motors, steam engines and hydrodynamic transmissions are all capable of developing torque when stalled.
