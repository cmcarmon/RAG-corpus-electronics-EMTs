  Then  turn  your  attention  to  linking  to  the  pads 
or edge connectors used for connecting the off-
 
 
board components. Minimize, as far as possible, 
the number of links required. Do not use links in 
 
the 0 V rail and avoid using them in the positive 
 
 
supply rail. 
16. Experiment  with  positioning  of 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the  pin  spacing  used  by 
17. Be  aware  of 
components  and  try  to  keep  this  consistent 
 
 
throughout.  With  the  exception  of  the  larger 
  wirewound resistors (which should be mounted 
on  ceramic 
 
lead 
 
components should be mounted flat against the 
  PCB  (with  their  leads  bent  at  right  angles). 
  Axial  lead  components  should  not  be  mounted 
 
18. Do  not  forget  that  tracks  may  be  conveniently 
 
routed  beneath  other  components.  Supply  rails 
in  particular  can  be  routed  between  opposite 
 
rows  of  pads  of  D1L  integrated  circuits;  this 
 
permits  very  effective  supply  distribution  and 
 
 
decoupling. 
19. Minimize  track  runs  as  far  as  possible  and 
  maintain constant spacing between parallel runs 
of  track.  Corners  should  be  radiused  and  acute 
 
internal and external angles should be avoided. 
 
 
In  exceptional  circumstances, 
it  may  be 
necessary to run a track between adjacent pads 
 
of  a  DIL  integrated  circuit.  In  such  cases,  the 
 
track should not be a common 0 V path, neither 
 
 
should it be a supply rail. 
 
Figure  19.8  shows  examples  of  good  and  bad 
practice associated with PCB layout while Fig. 19.9 
shows  an  example  of  a  PCB  layout  and  matching 
component  overlay  that  embodies  most  of  the 
techniques and principles discussed.
