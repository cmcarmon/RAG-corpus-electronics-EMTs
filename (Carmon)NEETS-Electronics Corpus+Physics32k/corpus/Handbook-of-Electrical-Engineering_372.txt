Consider  the  circuit  in  Fig.  3.28(b).  This  arrangement  is  similar  to  a  combination  of  three  of  the  simple
circuits in Fig. 3.28(a) connected in such a way that each one shares the return connection from O to N. The
three  sources  can  be  viewed  collectively  as  a  single  source  and  the  three  loadsâ€”which  are  assumed  to  be
