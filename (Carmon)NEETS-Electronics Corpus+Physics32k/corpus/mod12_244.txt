ANGLE MODULATION is modulation in which the angle of a sine-wave carrier is varied by a
modulating wave. FREQUENCY MODULATION (fm) and PHASE MODULATION (pm) are two types
of angle modulation. In frequency modulation the modulating signal causes the carrier frequency to vary.
These variations are controlled by both the frequency and the amplitude of the modulating wave. In phase
modulation the phase of the carrier is controlled by the modulating waveform. Letâ€™s study these
modulation methods for an understanding of their similarities and differences.
