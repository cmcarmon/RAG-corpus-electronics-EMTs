High-frequency flutter (above 1000 Hz) is caused by the fixed parts of a tape transport, such as fixed
tape guides and magnetic heads. When the magnetic tape passes over a fixed tape guide or magnetic head,
the transition from static to dynamic friction causes something called stiction. Itâ€™s this stiction that causes
the variations in tape speed which, in turn, cause the flutter.
