Performance of a memory system is measured in terms of latency and bandwidth. The latency of a memory
request is how long it takes the memory system to produce the result of the request. The bandwidth of a memory
system is the rate at which the memory system can accept requests and produce results. The memory hierarchy
improves average latency by quickly returning results that are found in the higher levels of the hierarchy. The
memory hierarchy generally reduces bandwidth requirements by intercepting a fraction of the memory requests
at higher levels of the hierarchy. Some machines—such as high-performance vector machines—may have fewer
levels  in  the  hierarchy,  increasing  memory  cost  for  better  predictability  and  performance.  Some  of  these
machines contain no caches at all, relying on large arrays of main memory banks to supply very high bandwidth,
with pipelined accesses to operands that mitigate the adverse performance impact of long latencies.
