A light wave passing through a block of glass is shown in figure 2-5. The wave moves from point A
to point B at a constant speed. This is the incident wave. As the wave penetrates the glass boundary at
point B, the velocity of the wave is slowed down. This causes the wave to bend toward the normal. The
wave then takes the path from point B to point C through the glass and becomes both the refracted wave
from the top surface and the incident wave to the lower surface. As the wave passes from the glass to the
air (the second boundary), it is again refracted, this time away from the normal, and takes the path from
point C to point D. After passing through the last boundary, the velocity increases to the original velocity
of the wave. As illustrated, refracted waves can bend toward or away from the normal. This bending
depends on the velocity of the wave through different mediums. The broken line between points B and E
is the path that the wave would travel if the two mediums (air and glass) had the same density.
