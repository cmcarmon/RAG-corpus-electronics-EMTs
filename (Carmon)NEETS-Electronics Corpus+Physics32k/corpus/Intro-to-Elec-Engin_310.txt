3.1.10 The voltage across a parallel combination of a 100-
 resistor and a 0.1-µF capacitor is 10 cos(5000t
+ 30°) V. Determine the admittance of the parallel
combination and ﬁnd the current from the supply
source. Sketch the phasor diagram showing all
quantities involved.
3.1.11 At the two terminals (A, B) of a one-port network,
the voltage and the current are given to be v(t ) =
√
200
2 cos
(377t + 30°) A.
(a) Determine the average real power, reactive
power, and volt-amperes absorbed by the net-
work.
