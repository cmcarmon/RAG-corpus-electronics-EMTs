In regular, ”alligator” style clips, both halves of the jaw are electrically common to each
other, usually joined at the hinge point. In Kelvin clips, the jaw halves are insulated from
each other at the hinge point, only contacting at the tips where they clasp the wire or terminal
of the subject being measured. Thus, current through the ”C” (”current”) jaw halves does not
go through the ”P” (”potential,” or voltage) jaw halves, and will not create any error-inducing
voltage drop along their length:
