The LSI systems can be further classiﬁed according to the
duration of the impulse response. An LSI system is called
ﬁnite-duration impulse response (FIR) if its impulse response
has ﬁnite support. An inﬁnite-duration impulse response
(IIR) LSI system has an impulse response with inﬁnite sup-
port. LSI systems are often referred to as ﬁlters in a generalized
sense, though the term ﬁlters is commonly understood in
terms of passing or rejecting signal content in a frequency-
selective manner. Hence, the labels FIR and IIR ﬁlters are
commonly used even when frequency selectivity is not the
objective. We now consider frequency domain analysis of
signals and systems.
