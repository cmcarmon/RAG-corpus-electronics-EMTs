An alternative way to refer to a clock skew schedule is to
specify the vector of all clock skews in a circuit corresponding
to a set of clock delays tcd as speciﬁed above. Denoted by s, the
vector column of clock skews is s ¼ s1 s2 . . . ]t
where the
skews s1, s2, . . . sn of all
local data paths in the circuit are
enumerated. Typically, the dimension of s is different from
the dimension of tcd for the same circuit. If a circuit consists
of r registers and p local data paths,
for example, then
s ¼ s1 . . . sp
for this circuit. There-
fore, the clock skew schedule refers to either tcd or s, where
the precise reference is usually apparent from the context.
