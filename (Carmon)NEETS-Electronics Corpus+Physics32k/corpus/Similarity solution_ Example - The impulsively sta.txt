Consider a semi-infinite domain bounded by a rigid wall and filled with viscous fluid. At time



t
=
0


{\displaystyle t=0}
the wall is made to move with constant speed



U


{\displaystyle U}
in a fixed direction (for definiteness, say the



x


{\displaystyle x}
direction and consider only the



x
−
y


{\displaystyle x-y}
plane). We can see that there is no distinguished length scale given in the problem, and we have the boundary conditions of no slip




u
=
U


{\displaystyle u=U}
on



y
=
0


{\displaystyle y=0}

and that the plate has no effect on the fluid at infinity




u
→
0


{\displaystyle u\rightarrow 0}
as



y
→
∞


{\displaystyle y\rightarrow \infty }
.
Now, if we examine the Navier-Stokes equations

u
→





{\displaystyle \rho \left({\dfrac {\partial {\vec {u}}}{\partial t}}+{\vec {u}}\cdot \nabla {\vec {u}}\right)=-\nabla p+\mu \nabla ^{2}{\vec {u}}}

we can observe that this flow will be rectilinear, with gradients in the



y


{\displaystyle y}
direction and flow in the



x


{\displaystyle x}
direction, and that the pressure term will have no tangential component so that







∂
p


∂
y




=
0


{\displaystyle {\dfrac {\partial p}{\partial y}}=0}
. The



x


{\displaystyle x}
component of the Navier-Stokes equations then becomes

u
→





∂

u
→





{\displaystyle {\dfrac {\partial {\vec {u}}}{\partial t}}=\nu \partial _{y}^{2}{\vec {u}}}

and we may apply scaling arguments to show that






U
t


∼
ν


U

y

2






{\displaystyle {\frac {U}{t}}\sim \nu {\frac {U}{y^{2}}}}

which gives us the scaling of the



y


{\displaystyle y}
co-ordinate as




y
∼
(
ν

)

1

/

{\displaystyle y\sim (\nu t)^{1/2}}
.
This allows us to pose a self-similar ansatz such that, with



f


{\displaystyle f}
and



η


{\displaystyle \eta }
dimensionless,




u
=
U
f

(

)



{\displaystyle u=Uf\left(\eta \equiv {\dfrac {y}{(\nu t)^{1/2}}}\right)}

We have now extracted all of the relevant physics and need only solve the equations; for many cases this will need to be done numerically. This equation is

{\displaystyle f=1-\operatorname {erf} (\eta /2)}
or

{\displaystyle u=U\left(1-\operatorname {erf} \left(-y/(4\nu t)^{1/2}\right)\right)}

which is a self-similar solution of the first kind.
