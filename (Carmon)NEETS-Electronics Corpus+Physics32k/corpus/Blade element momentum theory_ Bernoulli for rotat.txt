The velocity is the velocity of the fluid along a streamline. The streamline may not necessarily run parallel to a particular co-ordinate axis, such as the z-axis. Thus the velocity may consist of components in the axes that make up the co-ordinate system. For this analysis, we will use cylindrical polar co-ordinates



(
r
,

θ
,

z
)


{\displaystyle (r,~\theta ,~z)}
. Thus

{\displaystyle v^{2}=v_{r}^{2}+v_{\theta }^{2}+v_{z}^{2}}

{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =F_{r}{\hat {\mathbf {r} }}+F_{\theta }{\hat {\theta }}+F_{z}{\hat {\mathbf {z} }}}

Now consider the setup shown above. As before, we can break the setup into two components: upstream and downstream.
