The relation of equilibrium vapor pressure to the saturation vapor pressure can be thought of as a relative humidity measurement for the atmosphere. As Pv/Psat increases, vapor will continue to condense inside a given capillary. If Pv/Psat decreases, liquid will begin to evaporate into the atmosphere as vapor molecules. The figure below demonstrates four different systems in which Pv/Psat is increasing from left to right.

System A → Pv=0, no vapor is present in the system
System B → Pv=P1<Psat, capillary condensation occurs and liquid/vapor equilibrium is reached
System C → Pv=P2<Psat, P1<P2, as vapor pressure is increased condensation continues in order to satisfy the Kelvin equation
System D → Pv=Pmax<Psat, vapor pressure is increased to its maximum allowed value and the pore is filled completely
This figure is used to demonstrate the concept that by increasing the vapor pressure in a given system, more condensation will occur. In a porous medium, capillary condensation will always occur if Pv≠0.
