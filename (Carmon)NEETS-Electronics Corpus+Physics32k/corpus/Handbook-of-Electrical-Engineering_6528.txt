Various linearization techniques have been explored. The two most popular approaches are feedforward and
predistortion. Feedforward requires that a portion of the modulated output signal be detected and compared
to the original applied voltage signal to provide an error signal. This error signal is then used to modulate a
second laser, which is combined with the Ô¨Årst laser such that the total instantaneous intensity of the two lasers
is a replica of the applied voltage. In principle, this technique is capable of linearizing any order of distortion
and correcting RIN from the laser.
