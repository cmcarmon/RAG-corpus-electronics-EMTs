You can use your multimeter set to ohms to test any of these switches. Be 
sure to familiarize yourself with the on/off position(s) and the terminal con-
nections of the particular switch you’re testing — and run tests for each 
possibility. With your test leads connected across the terminals of any input/
output combination placed in the off position, the meter should read infinite 
ohms; the on position should give you a reading of 0 Ω.
