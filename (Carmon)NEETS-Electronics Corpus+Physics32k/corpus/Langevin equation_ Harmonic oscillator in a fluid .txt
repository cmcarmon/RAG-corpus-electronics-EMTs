A non-ideal harmonic oscillator is affected by some form of damping, from which it follows via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem that there must be some fluctuations in the system. The diagram at right shows a phase portrait of the time evolution of the momentum,

of a harmonic oscillator. Deterministic motion would follow along the ellipsoidal trajectories which cannot cross each other without changing energy. The presence of some form of damping, e.g. a molecular fluid environment (represented by diffusion and damping terms), continually adds and removes kinetic energy from the system, causing an initial ensemble of stochastic oscillators (dotted circles) to spread out, eventually reaching thermal equilibrium.
