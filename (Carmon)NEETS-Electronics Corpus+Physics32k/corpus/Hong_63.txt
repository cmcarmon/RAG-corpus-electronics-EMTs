In  digital  electronics,  buffer  refers  to  a  mechanism  in  the  communications  link 
between two devices. When there are time-lags between the transmitting device and the 
receiving  device,  some  temporary  storage  is  necessary  to  store  the  extra  data  that  can 
accumulate. This temporary storage mechanism is known as a buffer. For example, there 
is a buffer between the keyboard and the computer so that the CPU can finish one task 
before accepting more input to initiate another task. Digital video cameras have a much 
larger buffer to accumulate raw data from the camera before the data can be compressed 
and stored in a permanent location.
