Relationship Between Ter and Radiation–Noise Density
Let pdn(u, f) be the noise–power density of the incoming
radiation per unit solid angle and per unit bandwidth, as
seen by an ideal, matched ‘‘isotropic’’ antenna (gain function
Giso(u, f) ¼ 1, matched effective
area ¼ Aem(iso)). The
matched radiation noise Pnr received by an arbitrary antenna
can be expressed in terms of pdn(u, f) and the antenna’s
ð
effective area Aem(u, f) relative to Aem(iso):
