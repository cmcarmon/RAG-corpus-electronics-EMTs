From the patients’ point of view, it is critical to integrate their demographic information with their clinical
data. Usually the HIS contains all the ADT, orders, laboratory, pharmacy, etc. while the CIS may be more of a
departmental  system  such  as  ICU/CCU,  which  contains  hemodynamic  variables,  i.e.,  blood  pressure,  stroke
volume,  heart  rate,  etc.  Both  systems  need  to  coexist.  Point-of-care  systems,  many  times  known  as  bedside
terminals, include both general med/surgery and the ICU/CCU type. The general type include functions such
as  patient  assessment,  nursing  diagnosis,  patient  care  plans,  kardex,  discharge  planning,  discharge  summary,
medication administration record, I/O, vital signs, activities of daily living, patient classiﬁcation/acuity, etc. The
ICU/CCU systems in addition contain information regarding drug administration, ﬂuid analysis, hemodynamic
analysis  (i.e.,  blood  gas  report,  ECG,  blood  pressures,  pulse  oximeters,  cardiac  output),  respiratory  analysis
(i.e.,  ventilator  data,  O
  analyzer),  and  real-time  monitoring.  Today’s  trends  are  incorporating  imaging

devices in both at the regular nursing stations, at the operating rooms, and at the recovery room/ICU/CCU.
The  motivation  is  to  incorporate  all  patients’  information  and  have  it  available  wherever  they  may  be. As  a
patient moves from a regular bed to the OR, back to an ICU, and later to a regular nursing station, the electronic
record follows the patient. The one big difference with paper charts is that the electronic record can be shared
simultaneously within and outside the institution.
