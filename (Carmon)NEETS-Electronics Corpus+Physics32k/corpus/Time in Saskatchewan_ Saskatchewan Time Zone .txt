Due to these discrepancies, many computer programs and major operating systems offer a distinct "Saskatchewan" option when listing time zone options that automatically disables DST. In the tz database, both the America/Regina and America/Swift_Current entries result in Saskatchewan time.
The current wording of the Time Act says that during the entire year Saskatchewan observes "central standard time", which is defined to be "the time that is six hours behind Greenwich time". With respect to mean solar time however, this translates into Saskatchewan effectively being on DST year round. In the map above, Saskatchewan is the rectangle of Central Standard Time protruding into Mountain Standard Time in Canada, visually displaying that geographically, Saskatchewan is in the Mountain Time Zone.
