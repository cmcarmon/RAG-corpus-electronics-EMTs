Muzzle energy is the kinetic energy of a bullet as it is expelled from the muzzle of a firearm. It is often used as a rough indication of the destructive potential of a given firearm or load. The heavier the bullet and especially the faster it moves, the higher its muzzle energy and the more damage it will do.
The general formula for the kinetic energy is

{\displaystyle E_{k}={\begin{matrix}{\frac {1}{2}}\end{matrix}}mv^{2}}

where
v is the velocity of the bullet
m is the mass of the bullet.
A subsonic variant of ammunition that would otherwise be supersonic has its velocity limited to less than the speed of sound, i.e. v is fixed at around 300 metres per second (980 ft/s). For ammunition with this limitation the muzzle energy is variable only with respect to the bullet mass m.
