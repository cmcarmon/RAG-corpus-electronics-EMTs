Generally,  then,  to  obtain  good  high-density  particulate  recording  media  it  is  desired  to  have  adequate
coercivity  (to  achieve  the  required  recording  density),  small  particles  (for  low  noise),  with  a  very  narrow
switching  Ô¨Åeld  distribution  (to  obtain  a  narrow  transition),  to  have  them  oriented  along  the  direction  of
recording  (to  obtain  a  large  remanence),  and  to  have  them  uniformly  dispersed  (to  obtain  low  modulation
noise), with high packing density (to obtain large signals).
