The three-phase inputs with the associated rectiﬁer output voltage are shown in Fig. 5.7 as they would appear
without  the  low-pass  ﬁlter  section.  The  three-phase  bridge  rectiﬁer  has  a  reduced  ripple  content  of  4%  as
compared  to  a  ripple  content  of  47%  in  the  single-phase  bridge  rectiﬁer  [Milnes,  1980].  The  corresponding
diodes that conduct are also shown at the top of the ﬁgure. This output waveform assumes a purely resistive
load connected as shown in Fig. 5.6. Most loads (motors, transformers, etc.) and many sources (power grid)
include  some  inductance,  and  in  fact  may  be  dominated  by  inductive  properties.  This  causes  phase  shifts
between the input and output waveforms. The rectiﬁer output may thus vary in shape and phase considerably
from that shown in Fig. 5.7 [Kassakian et al., 1991]. When other types of switches are used in these circuits the
inductive elements can induce large voltages that may damage sensitive or expensive components. Diodes are
used regularly in such circuits to shunt current and clamp induced voltages at low levels to protect expensive
components such as electronic switches.
