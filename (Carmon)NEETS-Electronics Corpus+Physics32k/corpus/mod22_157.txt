An alternative to ROM is programmable read only memory (PROM) that can be purchased already 
programmed by the manufacturer or in a blank state. By using a blank PROM, you can enter any program 
into the memory. However, once the PROM has been written into, it can never be altered or changed. 
Thus you have the advantage of ROM with the additional flexibility to program the memory to meet a 
unique need. The main disadvantage of PROM is that if a mistake is made and entered into PROM, it 
cannot be corrected or erased. Also, a special device is needed to "burn" the program into PROM.
