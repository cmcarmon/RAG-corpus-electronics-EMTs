Most of the research efforts have been focused on developing
formulas for the peak noise pulse amplitude. The pulse width of
the cross talk noise and the peak noise occurring time, which are
of similar importance for circuit performance as the peak amp-
litude, should also be considered. Since digital gates are inher-
ently low-pass ﬁlter, they can ﬁlter out noise pulses with high
amplitude provided that the noise pulse width is sufﬁciently
narrow. Dynamic noise-immunity metrics, such as the noise-
immunity curve (NIC), are required (Elgamel et al., 2002).
