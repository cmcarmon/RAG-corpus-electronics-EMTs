j¼1 qj as the mathematical realization of the system
dynamics for the lth output. The yl, yi, uj 2 < are the lth
and ith system outputs and jth input, respectively. The d is
the relative degree of the system (the smallest delay from the
input signal to the system output). In general, fl may not
be readily available in mathematical format all the time due
to the difﬁculty of modeling a complex dynamic system. It is
possible, however, to develop a realization to describe the
system behavior off-line with a known bounded uncertainty
