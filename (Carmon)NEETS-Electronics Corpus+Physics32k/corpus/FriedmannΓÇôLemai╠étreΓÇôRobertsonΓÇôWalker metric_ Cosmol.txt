The cosmological constant term can be omitted if we make the following replacements




ρ
→
ρ
+



Λ

c

{\displaystyle \rho \rightarrow \rho +{\frac {\Lambda c^{2}}{8\pi G}}}





p

{\displaystyle p\rightarrow p-{\frac {\Lambda c^{4}}{8\pi G}}.}

Therefore, the cosmological constant can be interpreted as arising from a form of energy which has negative pressure, equal in magnitude to its (positive) energy density:




p
=
−
ρ

c

.



{\displaystyle p=-\rho c^{2}.\,}

Such form of energy—a generalization of the notion of a cosmological constant—is known as dark energy.
In fact, in order to get a term which causes an acceleration of the universe expansion, it is enough to have a scalar field which satisfies




p
<
−



ρ

c

.



{\displaystyle p<-{\frac {\rho c^{2}}{3}}.\,}

Such a field is sometimes called quintessence.
