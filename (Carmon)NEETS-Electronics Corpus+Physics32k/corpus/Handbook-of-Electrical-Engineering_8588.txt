If our program were to scan the indented block of code above, it would report ﬁnding six numbers. The symbols
that the program recognizes as potentially part of a number include the digits 0 to 9 and the symbols ‘e’, ‘E’, ‘ . ’, ‘–’
and ‘+’. Now it is certainly possible to include other symbols in legitimate numbers, such as HEX numbers or
the like, but this little routine will not properly deal with them. Our purpose was not to handle all comers but
to provide a routine with some variety of expression and possible application. Let us begin.
