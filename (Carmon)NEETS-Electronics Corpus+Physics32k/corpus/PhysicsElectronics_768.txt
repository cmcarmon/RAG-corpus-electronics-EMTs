Example: Using the 2â€™s complement convention, the 3-bit number ABC can
represent the numbers from -3 to 3 as shown in table 7.7 (ignore -4). Assuming
that A, B, C and A, B, C are available as inputs, the goal is to devise a circuit
that will yield a 2-bit output EF that is the absolute value of the ABC number.
You have available only two- and three-input AND and OR gates.
