There are many such polarized devices used in electric circuits. Most of them are made of so-
called semiconductor substances, and as such aren’t examined in detail until the third volume
of this book series. Like switches, lamps, and batteries, each of these devices is represented in a
schematic diagram by a unique symbol. As one might guess, polarized device symbols typically
contain an arrow within them, somewhere, to designate a preferred or exclusive direction of
current. This is where the competing notations of conventional and electron ﬂow really matter.
Because engineers from long ago have settled on conventional ﬂow as their ”culture’s” standard
notation, and because engineers are the same people who invent electrical devices and the
symbols representing them, the arrows used in these devices’ symbols all point in the direction
of conventional ﬂow, not electron ﬂow. That is to say, all of these devices’ symbols have arrow
marks that point against the actual ﬂow of electrons through them.
