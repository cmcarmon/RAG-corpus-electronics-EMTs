The  Wheatstone  bridge  (or  resistance  bridge)  circuit  is  used  in  a
number  of  applications.  Here  we  will  use  it  to  measure  an  unknown
resistance.  The  unknown  resistance 
is  connected  to  the  bridge  as
shown in Fig. 4.63. The variable resistance is adjusted until no current
ﬂows  through  the  galvanometer,  which  is  essentially  a  d’Arsonval
movement  operating  as  a  sensitive  current-indicating  device  like  an
ammeter in the microamp range. Under this condition 
and the
bridge is said to be balanced. Since no current ﬂows through the gal-
vanometer,

implies that
