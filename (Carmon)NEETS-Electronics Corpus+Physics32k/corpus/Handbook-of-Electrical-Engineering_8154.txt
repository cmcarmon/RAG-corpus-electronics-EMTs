where Ni is the number of ampere turns generating the magnetic ﬁeld, D the diameter of the cylindrical winding
generating  the  ﬁeld,  l  is  its  length,  and  VB  the  accelerating  voltage  expressed  in  volts.  From  the  above,  the
deﬂection angle is conversely proportional to the coil diameter. As the coil diameter is limited by the tube neck
diameter, it is preferable to use a small neck diameter to increase sensitivity to reduce deﬂection power. Because
a small neck diameter cannot accommodate the large electrostatic focusing lenses required to reduce spherical
aberration and spot size, a compromise must then be found between spot size and deﬂection power to achieve
the best CRT performance when electrostatic focus is required.
