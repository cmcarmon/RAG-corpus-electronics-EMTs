Weighing pan - The area in which an object is placed in order to be weighed.
Base - The base rests underneath the weighing pan and can usually be customised to fit on a workbench or set up with tripod legs.
Beams - The three beams on the balance are used to set the level of precision, with each beam working at different increments (1-10 grams, 10 grams and 100 grams). When using the triple beam balance, it is recommended that your start with the lowest level of precision e.g 100 gram increments and then work your way down. For example, if your object weighs 327 grams the 100 gram pointer will drop below the fixed mark on the 4th notch (400g), you will then need to move this back to the third notch (300g). This process will then need to be repeated for the 10 gram increments (20g) and then single figure units (7g).
Riders - The riders are the sliding pointers placed on top of the balance beams to indicate the mass in grams on the pan and beam.
Pointers - The scale pointer marks the equal point of the object's mass on the scale and mass on the beam
Zero adjustment knob - This is used to manually adjust the triple beam balance to the 'zero' mark (check to ensure that the pointer is at zero before use).
