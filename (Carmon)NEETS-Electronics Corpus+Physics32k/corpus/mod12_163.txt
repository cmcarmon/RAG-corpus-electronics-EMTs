BANDWIDTH OF AN AM WAVE.â€”An ideal carrier wave contains a single frequency and 
occupies very little of the frequency spectrum. When the carrier is amplitude modulated, sideband 
frequencies are created both above and below the carrier frequency. This causes the signal to use up a 
greater portion of the frequency spectrum. The amount of space in the frequency spectrum required by the 
signal is called the BANDWIDTH of the signal.
