The problem is attacked in two different ways. The element
replacement method eliminates the inductors by electronic
circuits whose input impedance is inductive over the relevant
frequency range. We encountered this method in Figure 4.7,
where the need for an inductor was avoided when L was
replaced by a GIC terminated in a resistor. The method of
operational simulation makes use of the fact that inductors
and capacitors fundamentally perform the function of integra-
tion, 1/s. Speciﬁcally, the voltage V across an inductor gener-
ates the current I ¼ V =(sL), and the current I through a
capacitor is integrated to produce the voltage V ¼ I=(sC).
Thus, we should need only to employ electronic integrators,
as in Figure 4.2, to arrive at an inductorless simulation of an
LC ladder.
