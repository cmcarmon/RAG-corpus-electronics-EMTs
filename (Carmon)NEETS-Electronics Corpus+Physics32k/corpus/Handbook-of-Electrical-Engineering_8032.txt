Microelectronics  is  able  to  produce  2  million  transistor  chips. While  they  are  expensive,  they  will  replace
virtually all of the peripheral chips: memory, timers, and communication channels can all be controlled from

a single chip. However, the humble 8-bit chip is still be the most cost-effective workhorse of the bulk of 
applications.
