This normalization has the great added advantage of redu-
cing the need to represent the ideal transformer in the circuit.
One must simply keep track of the nominal base voltage in
each part of the network. In this way, the equivalent trans-
former model is as given in Figure 7.3. Note that phase shifting
and off-nominal transformer ratios result in asymmetric cir-
cuits and require some additional manipulation in the per unit
framework. Those details are omitted here for brevity.
