While the above discussion might seem just philosophical, it is more than that. We normally read printed
text with our eyes. We recognize words from their (visual) letter combinations. We comprehend what we read
via a mysterious processing in the parietal and temporal parts of the cerebral cortex. Could we perhaps read
and comprehend this text or other forms of writing through our ﬁngertips with an appropriate interface? The
answer, surprisingly, is yes! And, the adaptation actually goes back to one of the earliest applications of coding
theory — that of the development of Braille. Braille condenses all text characters to a raised matrix of 2 by
combinations),  with  certain  combinations  reserved  as  indicators  for  the  next  character  (such  as  a
3 dots  (2
number indicator) or for special contractions. Trained readers of Braille can read over 250 words per minute
of grade 2 Braille (as fast as most sighted readers can read printed text). Thus, the Braille code is in essence a
rehabilitation  engineering  concept  where  an  alternate  sensory  channel  is  used  as  a  substitute  and  where  a
recoding scheme has been employed.
