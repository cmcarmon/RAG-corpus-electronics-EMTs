S
 should be as ﬂat
as possible over the broadest possible bandwidth. For some purposes, however, such as ultrasonic cleaning or
long-range  underwater  acoustic  propagation,  ﬁdelity  is  unnecessary  and  high  Q  resonant  transducers  are
employed to produce high-intensity sound over a narrow bandwidth.
