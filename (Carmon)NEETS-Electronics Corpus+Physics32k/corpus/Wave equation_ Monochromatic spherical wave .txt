Although the word "monochromatic" is not exactly accurate since it refers to light or electromagnetic radiation with well-defined frequency, the spirit is to discover the eigenmode of the wave equation in three-dimensions. Following the derivation in the previous section on Plane wave eigenmodes, if we again restrict our solutions to spherical waves that oscillate in time with well-defined constant angular frequency



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }
, then the transformed function



r
u

r

{\displaystyle ru(r,t)}
has simply plane wave solutions,

{\displaystyle u(r,t)={\frac {A}{r}}e^{i\left(\omega t\pm kr\right)}}
.
From this we can observe that the peak intensity of the spherical wave oscillation, characterized as the squared wave amplitude
