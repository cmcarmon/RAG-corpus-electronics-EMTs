Thyristors are widely used for applications where 
DC and AC power must be controlled. They are used 
to apply power to a load or remove power from a load. 
In addition, they can also be used to regulate power 
or adjust the amount of power applied to a loadâ€”for 
example, a dimmer control for a light or a motor speed 
control.
