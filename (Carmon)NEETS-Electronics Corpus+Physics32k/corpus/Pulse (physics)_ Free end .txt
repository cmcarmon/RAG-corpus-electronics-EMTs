A pulse will reflect off a free end and return with the same direction of displacement that it had before reflection. That is, a pulse with an upward displacement will reflect off the end and return with an upward displacement.
This is illustrated by figures 1 and 2 that were obtained by the numerical integration of the wave equation.
