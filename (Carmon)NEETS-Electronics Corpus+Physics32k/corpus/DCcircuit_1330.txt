Other times, magnetic hysteresis is a desirable thing. Such is the case when magnetic ma-
terials are used as a means of storing information (computer disks, audio and video tapes). In
these applications, it is desirable to be able to magnetize a speck of iron oxide (ferrite) and rely
on that material’s retentivity to ”remember” its last magnetized state. Another productive ap-
plication for magnetic hysteresis is in ﬁltering high-frequency electromagnetic ”noise” (rapidly
alternating surges of voltage) from signal wiring by running those wires through the middle
of a ferrite ring. The energy consumed in overcoming the hysteresis of ferrite attenuates the
strength of the ”noise” signal. Interestingly enough, the hysteresis curve of ferrite is quite
extreme:
