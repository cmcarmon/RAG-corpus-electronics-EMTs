3. Establish a set of alternative solutions and determine the one that
promises the greatest likelihood of success. There are essentially three
techniques that can be used to solve this problem. Later in the text you
will  see  that  you  can  use  circuit  analysis  (using  Kirchhoff’s  laws  and
Ohm’s law), nodal analysis, and mesh analysis.
