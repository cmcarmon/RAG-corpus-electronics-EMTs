Nickel crystals (face-centered cubic) have an easy direction of [111] and a hard direction of [100]. Cobalt
has the hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structure and the hexagonal axis is the easy direction at room temperature.
Magnetocrystalline anisotropy plays a very important part in determining the coercivity of ferro- or ferri-
