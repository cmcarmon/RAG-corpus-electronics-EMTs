The  effective  radiated  power  (ERP)  refers  to  the  effective  power  output  from  the  antenna  in  a  speciÔ¨Åed
direction  and  includes  the  transmitter  power  output,  transmission  line  losses,  and  antenna  power  gain.  The
ERP in most cases exceeds the transmitter output power, since that antenna power gain is normally 2 or more.
For a hypothetical perfect isotropic radiator with a power gain of 1, the ERP is found to be
