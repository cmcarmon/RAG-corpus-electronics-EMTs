The  leading  computer  manufacturers,  telecommunication  companies,  defense  contractors,  and  software
vendors  utilize  powerful  defect  tracking  systems  for  monitoring  both  pre-release  and  post-release  software
defects. These systems record all incoming defects and the symptoms which were present when the defect was
discovered.  They  offer  a  variety  of  supplemental  facilities  as  well.  Obviously  statistical  analysis  on  defect
quantities and severities is a by-product of defect tracking systems. Less obvious, but quite important, is support
for routing defects to the appropriate repair center and for notifying users of anticipated repair schedules. The
most powerful defect tracking systems can show defect trends by product, by development laboratory, by time
period, by country, by state, by city, by industry, and even by speciÔ¨Åc customer.
