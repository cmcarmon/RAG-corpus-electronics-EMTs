The Huntron Tracker 2000, shown in figure 2-33, is a versatile troubleshooting tool used to statically
test resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, transistors, multiple-component circuits, and integrated
circuits. Its built-in features eliminate the use of multiple pieces of test equipment. These features and its
lightweight portability make the 2000 a widely used tool for troubleshooting.
