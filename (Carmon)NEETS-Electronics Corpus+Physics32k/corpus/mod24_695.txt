In SURFACE-EMITTING LED'S (SLEDs), the size of the primary active region is limited to a
small circular area of 20 m to 50 m in diameter. The active region is the portion of the LED where
photons are emitted. SLEDs usually emit more total power into the air gap at the fiber interface than an
ELED, but they do not launch as much power into the fiber. SLEDS also tend to emit power over a wider
spectral range than ELED.
