Between points 2 and 3, where the falling water is releasing energy at the water-wheel,
there is a difference of pressure between the two points, reﬂecting the opposition to the ﬂow
of water through the water-wheel. From point 1 to point 2, or from point 3 to point 4, where
water is ﬂowing freely through reservoirs with little opposition, there is little or no difference
of pressure (no potential energy). However, the rate of water ﬂow in this continuous system is
the same everywhere (assuming the water levels in both pond and reservoir are unchanging):
through the pump, through the water-wheel, and through all the pipes. So it is with simple
electric circuits: the rate of electron ﬂow is the same at every point in the circuit, although
voltages may differ between different sets of points.
