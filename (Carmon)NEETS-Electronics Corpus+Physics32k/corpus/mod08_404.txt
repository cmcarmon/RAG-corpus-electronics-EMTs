For ease of explanation, in the circuit shown in figure 3-25 all the resistors have a value of 1 kilohm,
but any value could be used as long as the above ratio is true. For a subtractor circuit, the values of R1
and R3 must also be equal, and therefore, the values of R2 and R4 must be equal. It is NOT necessary that
the value of R1 equal the value of R2.
