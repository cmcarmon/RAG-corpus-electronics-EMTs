Pulse Repetition Frequency
The  radar  system  pulse  repetition  frequency  (PRF)  determines  its  ability  to  unambiguously  measure  target
range  and  range  rate  in  a  single  CPI  as  well  as  determining  the  inherent  clutter  rejection  capabilities  of  the
radar  system.  In  order  to  obtain  an  unambiguous  measurement  of  target  range,  the  interval  between  radar
pulses  (1/PRF)  must  be  greater  than  the  time  required  for  a  single  pulse  to  propagate  to  a  target  at  a  given
range  and  back.  The  maximum  unambiguous  range  is  then  given  by  C/(2  Â·  PRF)  where  C  is  the  velocity  of
electromagnetic propagation.
