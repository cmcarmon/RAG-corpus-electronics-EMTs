For notational convenience, clock skews in a circuit are
frequently denoted throughout this work with the small letter
s with a single subscript. In such cases, the clock skew sk
corresponds to a uniquely identiÔ¨Åed local data path k in the
circuit, where the local data paths have been numbered
1 through a certain number p. In other words, the skew s1
corresponds to the local data path one, the skew s2 corresponds
to the local data path two, and so on.
