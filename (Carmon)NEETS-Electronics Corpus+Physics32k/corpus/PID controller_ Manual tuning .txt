If the system must remain online, one tuning method is to first set




K

i




{\displaystyle K_{i}}
and




K

d




{\displaystyle K_{d}}
values to zero. Increase the




K

p




{\displaystyle K_{p}}
until the output of the loop oscillates, then the




K

p




{\displaystyle K_{p}}
should be set to approximately half of that value for a "quarter amplitude decay" type response. Then increase




K

i




{\displaystyle K_{i}}
until any offset is corrected in sufficient time for the process. However, too much




K

i




{\displaystyle K_{i}}
will cause instability. Finally, increase




K

d




{\displaystyle K_{d}}
, if required, until the loop is acceptably quick to reach its reference after a load disturbance. However, too much




K

d




{\displaystyle K_{d}}
will cause excessive response and overshoot. A fast PID loop tuning usually overshoots slightly to reach the setpoint more quickly; however, some systems cannot accept overshoot, in which case an overdamped closed-loop system is required, which will require a




K

p




{\displaystyle K_{p}}
setting significantly less than half that of the




K

p




{\displaystyle K_{p}}
setting that was causing oscillation.
