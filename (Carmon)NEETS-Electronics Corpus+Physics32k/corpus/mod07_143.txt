The semiconductor diode shown in the figure can be replaced by a metallic rectifier and still achieve
the same results. The metallic rectifier, sometimes referred to as a dry-disc rectifier, is a metal-to-
semiconductor, large-area contact device. Its construction is distinctive; a semiconductor is sandwiched
between two metal plates, or electrodes, as shown in figure 1-22. Note in the figure that a barrier, with a
resistance many times greater than that of the semiconductor material, is constructed on one of the metal
electrodes. The contact having the barrier is a rectifying contact; the other contact is nonrectifying.
Metallic rectifiers act just like the diodes previously discussed in that they permit current to flow more
readily in one direction than the other. However, the metallic rectifier is fairly large compared to the
crystal diode as can be seen in figure 1-23. The reason for this is: metallic rectifier units are stacked (to
prevent inverse voltage breakdown), have large area plates (to handle high currents), and usually have
cooling fins (to prevent overheating).
