Asynchronous Transfer Mode
In  today’s  public  switched  networks  the  synchronous  transfer  mode  (STM)  predominates.  Applying  STM
technology, for the duration of a connection a synchronous channel with constant bit rate is allocated to that
connection.  STM  does  not  ﬁt  very  well  for  the  integration  of  services  with  bit  rates  from  some  kilobits  per
 (ATM)
second to 130 Mbit/s. Therefore, in B-ISDN a new transfer mode called 
is used.
