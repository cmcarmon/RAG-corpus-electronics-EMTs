Equation (89.1) may be used to calculate the light output required from the display surface, which may be
a CRT or other light-emitting device, but with the limitation that most of the ﬂat panel units are matrix driven
and must track the drive sequence in order to know the location of the light pen from the drive pulse timing.
When phosphors are involved as for the CRT, vacuum ﬂuorescent displays (VFDs), thin-ﬁlm electroluminescent
(TFEL) units, and color liquid crystal displays (LCDs), the phosphor delays must be entered into the timing,
and the total delay is given by
