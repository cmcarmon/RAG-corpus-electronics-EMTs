Particle acceleration is ubiquitous in nature and understanding its nature is one of the fundamental problems of space plasma astrophysics. The unique data set obtained by ACE measurements have been used to:
Make direct measurements of charge and/or mass–dependent fractionation during solar energetic particle and interplanetary acceleration events.
Constrain solar flare, coronal shock, and interplanetary shock acceleration models with charge, mass, and spectral data spanning up to five decades in energy.
Test theoretical models for 3He–rich flares and solar γ–ray events.
