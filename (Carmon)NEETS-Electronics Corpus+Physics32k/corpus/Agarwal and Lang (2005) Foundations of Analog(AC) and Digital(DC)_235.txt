19. Notice that before the advent of currencies, the barter system prevailed, and wealth was indeed
analog in nature, since a loaf of bread, or a plot of land for that matter, theoretically is infinitely
divisible!
20. For applications that care only about whether a signal is above or below some threshold, the
loss in precision is of no consequence, and a two-level representation is sufficient. However, for
other applications that care about small changes in a signal, the basic two-level representation of
a signal must be extended. We show in Chapter 5 that practical digital systems can offer both
arbitrary degrees of precision and noise immunity through a process of discretization and coding.
Briefly, to recover some precision while retaining noise immunity, digital systems quantize signals
into a large number of levels
and code these levels into a few binary
digits
8, in our example, where each binary digit can be represented as a two-level voltage on
a single wire. This method converts an analog signal on a single wire into a binary encoded signal
on several wires, where each wire carries a voltage that can vary between two levels.
