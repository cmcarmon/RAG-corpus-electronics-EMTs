As with tunnel-diode amplifiers, low-noise generation is one of the more attractive characteristics of 
tunnel-diode frequency converters. Low-noise generation is a primary concern in the design of today's 
extremely sensitive communications and radar receivers. This is one reason tunnel-diode circuits are 
finding increasingly wide application in these fields.
