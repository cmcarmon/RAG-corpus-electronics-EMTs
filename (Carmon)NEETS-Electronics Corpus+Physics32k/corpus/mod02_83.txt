permeability has less reluctance to the magnetic flux, resulting in more magnetic lines of force. This 
increase in the magnetic lines of force increases the number of lines of force cutting each loop of the coil, 
thus increasing the inductance of the coil. It should now be apparent that the inductance of a coil increases 
directly as the permeability of the core material increases.
