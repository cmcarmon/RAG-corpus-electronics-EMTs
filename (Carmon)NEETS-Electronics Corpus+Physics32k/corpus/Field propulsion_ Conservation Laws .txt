Conservation of momentum is a fundamental requirement of propulsion systems because in experiments momentum is always conserved, and is implicit in published work of Newton and Galileo. In each of the propulsion technologies, some form of energy exchange is required with momentum directed backward at light speed c or some lesser velocity v to balance the forward change of momentum. In absence of interaction with an external field, the power P that is required to create a thrust force F is given.
F = P/v when mass is ejected or F=P/c if mass free energy is ejected.
For a photon rocket the efficiency is too small to be competitive. Other technologies may have better efficiency if the ejection velocity is less than light speed, or a local field can interact with another large scale field of the same type residing in space, which is the intent of field effect propulsion.
