Several other MOS-gated structures, such as base resistance-
controlled thyristor (BRT), insulated gate-controlled thyristor
(IGCT), injection-enhanced transistor (IEGT), MOS-turn-off
thyristor (MTO), and so forth have been introduced in the
recent past to further optimize the on-state and switching
performance at high voltage and current levels.
