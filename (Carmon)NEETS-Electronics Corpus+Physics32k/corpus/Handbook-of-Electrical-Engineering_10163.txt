In  general,  compliance  motion  control  is  very  important  whenever  the  robot  is  required  to  make  contact
with its “environment.” This is true for many assembly tasks. Apart from the active methods of control discussed
above, passive methods can be used to introduce the desired compliance. One such passive scheme is the use
of a remote center compliance (RCC) device developed at Draper Laboratories. The RCC is a purely mechanical
device consisting of a spring with six degrees of freedom that is inserted between the wrist and the end effector.
By adjusting the stiffness of the springs, various levels of compliance can be obtained. However, passive methods
suffer from lack of programmability achieved through active methods. Active control methods, however, require
