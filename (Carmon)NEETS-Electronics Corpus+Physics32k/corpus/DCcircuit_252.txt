Another effect of electric current on the body, perhaps the most signiﬁcant in terms of haz-
ard, regards the nervous system. By ”nervous system” I mean the network of special cells in
the body called ”nerve cells” or ”neurons” which process and conduct the multitude of signals
responsible for regulation of many body functions. The brain, spinal cord, and sensory/motor
organs in the body function together to allow it to sense, move, respond, think, and remember.
Nerve cells communicate to each other by acting as ”transducers:” creating electrical sig-
nals (very small voltages and currents) in response to the input of certain chemical compounds
called neurotransmitters, and releasing neurotransmitters when stimulated by electrical sig-
nals. If electric current of sufﬁcient magnitude is conducted through a living creature (human
or otherwise), its effect will be to override the tiny electrical impulses normally generated by
the neurons, overloading the nervous system and preventing both reﬂex and volitional sig-
nals from being able to actuate muscles. Muscles triggered by an external (shock) current will
involuntarily contract, and there’s nothing the victim can do about it.
