CHARGED BODIES affect each other as follows: When two bodies having unequal charges are
brought close to each other, they will tend to attract each other in an attempt to equalize their respective
charges. When two bodies, both having either positive or negative charges, are brought close together,
they tend to repel each other as no equalization can occur. When the charge on one body is high enough
with respect to the charge on an adjacent body, an equalizing current will flow between the bodies
regardless of the conductivity of the material containing the bodies.
