The only manual process in the above system is adjustment of the reﬂow proﬁle based on the results of soldering
an assembly. The last step in the process would be to test the ﬁnished prototype board. This system could also
be used for very small volume production runs, and all components as described are available. With a change
from milled boards to etched boards, the system can be used as a ﬂexible assembly system.
