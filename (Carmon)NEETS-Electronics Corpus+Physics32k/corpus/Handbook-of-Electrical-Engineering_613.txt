Thus, while chaotic signals share many of the properties of stochastic processes, they also possess a deter-
ministic structure that makes it possible to generate noise-like chaotic signals in a theoretically reproducible
manner. In particular, a continuous-time chaotic system can be used to generate a wideband noise-like signal
with robust and reproducible statistical properties [2].
