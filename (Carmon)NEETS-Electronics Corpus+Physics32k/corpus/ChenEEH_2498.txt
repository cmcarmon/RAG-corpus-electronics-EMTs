tunable. Ferrite components and some special material-related
circuits (e.g., ferroelectrics) constitute another class of passive
microwave components. They may be used to design tunable
circuits by applying external magnetic or electric Ô¨Åelds. Ideally,
no external energy consumption takes place even in this case.
Ferrite components have been widely used for isolators, phase
shifters, and other nonreciprocal circuit functions like circula-
tors and others.
