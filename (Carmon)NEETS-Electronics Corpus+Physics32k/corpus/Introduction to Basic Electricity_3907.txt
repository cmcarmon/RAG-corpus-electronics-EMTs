The differential amplifier has a high degree of 
temperature stability because transistors Q1 and Q2 
are mounted close together and therefore are equally 
 affected by temperature changes. Also, the collector 
currents of transistors Q1 and Q2 tend to increase and 
decrease by the same amount so that the output volt-
age remains constant.
