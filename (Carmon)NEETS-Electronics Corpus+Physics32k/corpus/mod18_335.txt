During the resting time, the atr spark gap is not broken down by the received signals. The received
signal sets up standing waves within the cavity that cause it to resonate. At resonance, the low impedance
of the atr cavity is reflected as a high impedance at the entrance to the transmitter waveguide (three-
quarter wavelength away). This ensures that the maximum received signal will enter the receiver branch.
