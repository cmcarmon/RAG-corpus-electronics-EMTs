Solution:
This  is  an  example  of  a  second-order  circuit  with  two  inductors.  We
ﬁrst obtain the mesh currents 
and  which happen to be the currents
through the inductors. We need to obtain the initial and ﬁnal values of
these currents.
t 6 0,
t 7 0,
so that the equivalent circuit is as shown in Fig. 8.30(a). Due
