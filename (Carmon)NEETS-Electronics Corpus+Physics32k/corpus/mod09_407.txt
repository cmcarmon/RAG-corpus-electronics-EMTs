The capacitors that were removed from figure 3-19 must be returned to the flip-flop as shown in 
figure 3-22 to change the state of the flip-flop from one condition to the other. Capacitors C3 and C4 
transmit almost instantaneously any changes in voltage from the collector of one transistor to the base of 
the other. Capacitors C1 and C2 are input coupling capacitors.
