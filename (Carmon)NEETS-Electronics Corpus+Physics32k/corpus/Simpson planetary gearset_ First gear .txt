In Simpson's gearbox, the first gear is the most difficult to understand, and probably the one that causes most stress in the components. It happens because there is a feedback: the first gearset actuates on the second gearset and output shaft; the second gearset reacts and makes the sun turn in reverse, causing the first gearset to increase the reduction ratio. The mechanical energy has actually to "loop" in the gearset system until settling the ratio.
