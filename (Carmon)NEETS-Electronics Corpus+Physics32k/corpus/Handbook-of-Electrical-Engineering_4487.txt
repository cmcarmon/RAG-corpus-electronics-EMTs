The environment illustrated in Fig. 44.4 also shows tools for automatic optimization that are now becoming
feasible in industrial design applications. Both deterministic and stochastic methods for minimizing constrained
objective functions of the design space have been developed for electromagnetic applications (For a review see
Russenschuck, 1996). It must be emphasized, however, that the use of optimizing methods is only part of the
total problem of design. For example, the process of automatic synthesis based on design rules and engineering
