Principle of Operation
Materials classed as liquid crystals are typically liquid at high temperatures and solid at low temperatures, but
in the intermediate temperature range they display characteristics of both. Although there are many different
types of liquid crystals used, we will concentrate here on the use of nematic crystals in twisted nematic devices,
the most common by far.
