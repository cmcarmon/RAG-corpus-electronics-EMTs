All the circuit breakers presented so far in this chapter have been physically large, designed to
control large amounts of power, and used a type of toggle operating mechanism. Not all circuit breakers
are of this type. The circuit breaker in figure 2-23 is physically large and controls large amounts of power;
but the operating mechanism is not a toggle. Except for the difference in the operating mechanism, this
circuit breaker is identical to the circuit breakers already presented.
