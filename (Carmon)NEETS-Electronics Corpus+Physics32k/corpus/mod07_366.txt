The operation of the MOSFET, or IGFET, is basically the same as the operation of the JFET. The 
current flow between the source and drain can be controlled by using either of two methods or by using a 
combination of the two methods. In one method the drain voltage controls the current when the gate 
potential is at zero volts. A voltage is applied to the gate in the second method. An electric field is formed 
by the gate voltage that affects the current flow in the channel by either depleting or enhancing the 
number of current carriers available. As previously stated, a reverse bias applied to the gate depletes the 
carriers, and a forward bias enhances the carriers. The polarity of the voltages required to forward or 
reverse bias a MOSFET depends upon whether it is of the P-channel type or the N-channel type. The 
effects of reverse-bias voltage on a MOSFET designed to operate in the depletion mode are illustrated in
