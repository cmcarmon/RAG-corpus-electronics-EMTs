Recent evidence from the spacecraft Cassini has confirmed that the same interchange process is prominent on Saturn. Unlike Jupiter, the events happen much more frequently and more clearly. The difference lies in the configuration of the magnetosphere. Since Saturn’s gravity is much weaker, the gradient/curvature drift for a given particle energy and L value is about 25 times faster. Saturn’s magnetosphere provides a much better environment for the study of interchange instability under these conditions even though the process is essential in both Jupiter and Saturn. In a case study of one injection event, the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) produced characteristic radial profiles of plasma densities and temperatures of the plasma particles that also allowed the calculation of the origin of the injection and the radial propagation velocity. The electron density inside the event was lowered by a factor of about 3, the electron temperature was higher by an order of magnitude than the background, and there was a slight increase in the magnetic field [Rhymer et al. 2009]. The study also used a model of pitch angle distributions to estimate the event originated between 9<L<11 and had a radial speed of about 260+60/-70 km/s. These results are similar to the Galileo results discussed earlier [Thorne et al. 1997]. The similarities imply that the Saturn and Jupiter processes are the same.
