The capacitors and rf chokes in figure 1-26, views (A) and (B), prevent surges of current. In view 
(B), the choke coil causes a lag in the current when the key is closed, and the current builds up gradually 
instead of instantly. The capacitor charges as the key is opened and slowly releases the energy stored in 
the magnetic field of the inductor. The resistor controls the rate of charge of the capacitor and also 
prevents sparking at the key contacts by the sudden discharge of the capacitor when the key is closed.
