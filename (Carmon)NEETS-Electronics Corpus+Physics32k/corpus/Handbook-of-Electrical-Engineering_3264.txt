Properties of Light
The strict deÔ¨Ånition of light is electromagnetic radiation to which the eye is sensitive. Optical devices, however,
can operate over a larger range of the electromagnetic spectrum, and so the term usually refers to devices which
can operate in some part of the spectrum from the near ultraviolet (UV) through the visible range to the near
infrared. Figure 31.2 shows the whole spectrum and delineates these ranges.
