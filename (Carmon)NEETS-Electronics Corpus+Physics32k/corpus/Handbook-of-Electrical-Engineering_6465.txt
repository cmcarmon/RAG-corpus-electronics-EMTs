The condition under which the two options are available can be stated in an alternate manner. If one envisions
what  is  taking  place  in  the  frequency  domain,  it  is  straightforward  to  show  that  the  condition  of  the  chip
duration being smaller than the multipath delay spread is equivalent to requiring that the spread bandwidth
of the transmitted waveform exceed what is called the coherence bandwidth of the channel. This latter quantity
is simply the inverse of the multipath delay spread and is a measure of the range of frequencies that fade in a
highly  correlated  manner.  Indeed,  anytime  the  coherence  bandwidth  of  the  channel  is  less  than  the  spread
bandwidth of the signal, the channel is said to be  frequency selective with respect to the signal. Thus, we see
that  to  take  advantage  of  DS  signalling  when  used  over  a  multipath  fading  channel,  that  signal  should  be
designed such that it makes the channel appear frequency selective.
