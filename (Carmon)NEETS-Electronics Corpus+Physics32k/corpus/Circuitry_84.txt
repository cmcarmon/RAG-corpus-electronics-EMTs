Example 2.13 
 
Determine  the  effective  resistance  of  the  circuit 
shown in Fig. 2.12. 
 
Solution 
 
The  circuit  can  be  progressively  simplified  as 
shown in Fig. 2.13. The stages in this simplification 
are: 
 
(a)   R3 and R4 are in series and they can replaced 
by a single resistance (RA) of (12 $ + 27 $) =
 
39 $.
