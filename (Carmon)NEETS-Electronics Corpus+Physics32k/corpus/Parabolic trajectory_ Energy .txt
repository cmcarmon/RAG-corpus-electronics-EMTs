Under standard assumptions, specific orbital energy (



ϵ



{\displaystyle \epsilon \,}
) of parabolic trajectory is zero, so the orbital energy conservation equation for this trajectory takes form:




ϵ
=



v

2


2


−


μ

r



=
0


{\displaystyle \epsilon ={v^{2} \over 2}-{\mu  \over {r}}=0}

where:




v



{\displaystyle v\,}
is orbital velocity of orbiting body,




r



{\displaystyle r\,}
is radial distance of orbiting body from central body,




μ



{\displaystyle \mu \,}
is the standard gravitational parameter.
This is entirely equivalent to the characteristic energy (square of the speed at infinity) being 0:





C

=
0


{\displaystyle C_{3}=0}
