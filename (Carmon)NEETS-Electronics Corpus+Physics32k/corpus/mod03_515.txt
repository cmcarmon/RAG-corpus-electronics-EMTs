When current flows through the conductor, it produces a magnetic field. The magnetic flux produced
by the coil results in establishing north and south poles in both the core and the plunger. The plunger is
attracted along the lines of force to a position at the center of the coil. As shown in figure 3-17, the
deenergized position of the plunger is partially out of the coil due to the action of the spring. When
voltage is applied, the current through the coil produces a magnetic field. This magnetic field draws the
plunger within the coil, resulting in mechanical motion. When the coil is deenergized, the plunger returns
to its normal position because of spring action. The effective strength of the magnetic field on the plunger
varies according to the distance between the plunger and the core. For short distances, the strength of the
field is strong; and as distances increase, the strength of the field drops off quite rapidly.
