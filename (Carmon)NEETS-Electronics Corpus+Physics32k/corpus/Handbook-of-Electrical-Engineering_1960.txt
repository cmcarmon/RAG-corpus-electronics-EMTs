These three types of relaxations make it possible to implement pipelined transversal and lattice adaptive digital
ﬁlters with marginal increase in hardware overhead. Relaxations on the weight update operations change the
convergence behavior of the adaptive ﬁlter, and we are forced to examine carefully the convergence behavior
of the relaxed look-ahead adaptive digital ﬁlters. It has been shown that the relaxed look-ahead adaptive digital
ﬁlters do not suffer from degradation in adaptation behavior. Futhermore, when coding, the use of pipelined
adaptive ﬁlters could lead to a dramatic increase in pixel rate with no degradation in signal-to-noise ratio of
the coded image and no increase in hardware overhead [Shanbhag and Parhi, 1992].
