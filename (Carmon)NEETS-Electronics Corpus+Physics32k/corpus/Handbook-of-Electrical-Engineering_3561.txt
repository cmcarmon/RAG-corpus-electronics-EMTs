Figure 34.17 shows that 
 follows physical design. After physical design, the digital system is manufactured
and test checks the resulting hardware for correct function and performance. Thus, the primary objective of
test is to detect a faulty device by applying input test stimuli and observing expected results [Buckroyd, 1989;
Weyerer and Goldemund, 1992].
