electrically neutral. In this state, it is said to have a "zero charge." Electrons will neither leave nor enter
the neutrally charged body should it come in contact with other neutral bodies. If, however, any number
of electrons are removed from the atoms of a body of matter, there will remain more protons than
electrons and the whole body of matter will become ELECTRICALLY POSITIVE. Should the positively
charged body come in contact with another body having a normal charge, or having a NEGATIVE (too
many electrons) charge, an electric current will flow between them. Electrons will leave the more
negative body and enter the positive body. This electron flow will continue until both bodies have equal
charges. When two bodies of matter have unequal charges and are near one another, an electric force is
exerted between them because of their unequal charges. However, since they are not in contact, their
charges cannot equalize. The existence of such an electric force, where current cannot flow, is referred to
as static electricity. ("Static" in this instance means "not moving.") It is also referred to as an electrostatic
force.
