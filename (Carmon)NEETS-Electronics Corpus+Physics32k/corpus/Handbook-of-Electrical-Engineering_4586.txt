In essentially all computer modeling, there are two basic kinds of errors. One, the physical
modeling error, arises from replacing some real-world physical problems with some idealized mathemat-
ical representation. The other, the numerical modeling error, comes from obtaining only an approximate
solution to that idealized representation. Usually, the numerical modeling error can be reduced below
the  physical  modeling  error  if  enough  unknowns,  i.e.,  a  large  enough  matrix,  are  used  to  model  the
problem of interest.
