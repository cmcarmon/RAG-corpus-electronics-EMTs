If, for example, the gear ratio between the two transmitters is 36 to 1, 1 revolution of the rotor of the 
first transmitter causes 36 revolutions of the rotor of the second transmitter. The first transmitter-the one 
that accepts the external input-can be called the coarse transmitter, and the second one can be called the 
fine transmitter. Representative speeds include 1 and 36, 2 and 36, and 2 and 72.
