We have to obtain a suitable tensor to describe the geometry of space in the presence of an energy field. Einstein proposed this equation in 1917, written as:





G

α
γ


+
Λ

g

α
γ


=
(

c
o
n
s
t

)

T

α
γ




{\displaystyle G^{\alpha \gamma }+\Lambda g^{\alpha \gamma }=(\mathrm {const} )T^{\alpha \gamma }}

(const) is what will become Einstein's constant. We will take the cosmological constant Λ equal to zero (one of the requirements of the properties of the gravitational equations is that they reduce to the free-space field equations when the density of energy in space Tαγ is zero, therefore that the cosmological constant Λ appearing in this equation is zero) so the field equation becomes:





G

α
γ

R

)

=
κ

T

α
γ




{\displaystyle G^{\alpha \gamma }=\left(R^{\alpha \gamma }-{\tfrac {1}{2}}g^{\alpha \gamma }R\right)=\kappa T^{\alpha \gamma }}

where Rαγ is the Ricci tensor, gαγ is the metric tensor, R the scalar curvature and κ is Einstein's constant we will calculate in the next section..
This equation can be written in another form, contracting indices:







R

g

T

α





{\displaystyle {R^{\alpha }}_{\alpha }-{\tfrac {1}{2}}{g^{\alpha }}_{\alpha }R=\kappa {T^{\alpha }}_{\alpha }~}

Thus:




R

T

=

T


{\displaystyle R=-{\kappa T^{\alpha }}_{\alpha }=-\kappa T}

where T is the scalar Tαα which we shall refer to as the Laue scalar.
Using this result we can write the field equation as:
