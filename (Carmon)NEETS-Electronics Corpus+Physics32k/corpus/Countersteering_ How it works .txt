When countersteering to turn left, the following is performed:
A torque on the handlebars to the right is applied.
The front wheel will then rotate about the steering axis to the right and the tire will generate forces in the contact patch to the right.
The machine as a whole steers to the right
Because the forces in the contact patch are at ground level, this pulls the wheels "out from under" the bike to the right and causes it to lean to the left.
The rider, or in most cases the inherent stability of the bike, provides the steering torque necessary to rotate the front wheel back to the left and in the direction of the desired turn.
The bike begins a turn to the left.
While this appears to be a complex sequence of motions, it is performed by every child who rides a bicycle. The entire sequence goes largely unnoticed by most riders, which is why some assert that they do not do it.
It is also important to distinguish the steering torque necessary to initiate the lean required for a given turn from the sustained steering torque and steering angle necessary to maintain a constant radius and lean angle until it is time to exit the turn.
The initial steer torque and angle are both opposite the desired turn direction.
The sustained steer angle is in the same direction as the turn.
The sustained steer torque required to maintain that steer angle is either with or opposite the turn direction depending on forward speed, bike geometry, and combined bike and rider mass distribution.
