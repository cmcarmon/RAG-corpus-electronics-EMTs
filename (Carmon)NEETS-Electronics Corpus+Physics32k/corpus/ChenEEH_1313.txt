Small Computer System Interface
Small computer system interface (SCSI), standardized in 1986,
is a ï¬‚exible I/O bus that has been used in a number of peripherals
such as disk drives, CD-ROM drives, tape drives, and scanners.
SCSI drives have much higher transfer rates than IDE drives.
A SCSI-controlling card plugged into a system expansion slot
serves as a host to other SCSI devices. At most, 7 SCSI devices can
be linked together to a host (15 for wide SCSI).
