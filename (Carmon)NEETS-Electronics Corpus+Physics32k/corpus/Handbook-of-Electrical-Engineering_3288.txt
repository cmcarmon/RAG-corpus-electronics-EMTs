Higher luminance is achieved by using higher gas pressures. The ﬂuorescent lamp is very efﬁcient since a
high proportion of the input electrical energy is converted to light. White light is achieved by coating the inside
of the container with various types of phosphor. The gas, for example a mercury–argon mixture, provides UV
and violet radiation which excites the phosphor. Since the light is produced by ﬂuorescence and phosphores-
cence, the spectral content of the light does not follow Planck’s radiation law but is characteristic of the coating
(e.g., soft white, cool white).
