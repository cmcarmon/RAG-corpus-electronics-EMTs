Static RAMs (SRAMs)
The primary advantages of SRAMs as compared to DRAMs are high speed and ease of use. In addition, SRAMs
fabricated in CMOS technology exhibit extremely low standby power. This later feature is effectively used in
much portable equipment like pocket calculators. Bipolar SRAMs are generally faster but less dense than FET
versions. Figure 80.4 illustrates two cells. SRAM performance is dominated by the speed of the support circuits,
leading some manufacturers to design bipolar support circuits to FET arrays.
