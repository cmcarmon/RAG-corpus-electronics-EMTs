In mechanics, the configuration of a system consists of the positions had by all components subject to kinematical constraints. The set of velocities available to a system defines a plane tangent to the configuration manifold of the system. Momentum vectors are linear functionals of the tangent plane, known as cotangent vectors. Thus, the set of positions and momenta of a mechanical system forms the cotangent bundle of the configuration manifold.
This larger manifold is called the phase space of the system. The joint space and configuration space can be viewed as a bijection on the phase space of a mechanical system.
