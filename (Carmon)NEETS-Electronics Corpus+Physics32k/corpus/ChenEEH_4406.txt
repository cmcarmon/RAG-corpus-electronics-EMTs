typically added on the exogenous input channels and the
performance output channels. The former weights serve to
include in the model spectral information about the inputs.
The latter weights are important in design to emphasize the
frequency bands where the performance outputs need to be
minimized. A possible design problem that results is to Ô¨Ånd a
