When the dependencies are linear, dependent sources are amenable to the set of
analyses discussed earlier in Chapters 2 and 3. Care must be taken, however, in
applying the superposition principle. Recall that the principle of superposition
allows linear multisource networks to be solved for one source at a time by
setting all other independent sources to zero. Setting a voltage source to zero
means replacing it with a short circuit; a current source set to zero is an open
circuit. The complete response is the sum of the responses to each individual
source.
