The rotating frame of reference introduces some interesting pseudo-forces into the equations through the material derivative term. Consider a stationary inertial frame of reference K, and a non-inertial frame of reference K', which is translating with velocity

with respect to the stationary frame. The Navier-Stokes equation observed from the non-inertial frame then becomes

are measured in the non-inertial frame. The first term in the parenthesis represents Coriolis acceleration, the second term is due to centripetal accleration, the third is due to the linear acceleration of K' with respect to K and the fourth term is due to the angular acceleration of K' with respect to K.
