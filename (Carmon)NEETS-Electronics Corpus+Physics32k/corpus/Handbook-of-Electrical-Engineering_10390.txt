Capital investment constraints limit strict adherence to either architectural approach. MTACCS is a meta-
system of seven independently developed systems and is best described as a hybrid architecture. Most commu-
nication systems within any of the above architectures existed prior to an architecture and thus have a hybrid nature.
Doctrine  is  a  formalized  description  of  military  mission  deﬁnitions  and  often  includes  the  procedures  to
accomplish  those  missions.  Doctrine  will  also  often  specify  the  organizational  structure  appropriate  to  the
speciﬁc  missions.  Some  military  establishments  adhere  to  strong  doctrinal  orientation,  even  down  to  strict
dictation  of  technology  developments.  Other  establishments  treat  doctrine  as  a  loose  guideline  that  can  be
liberally modiﬁed. One foreign military analyst observed that U.S. commanders did not seem to read their own
doctrinal  publications,  and  even  if  they  did,  would  not  feel  compelled  to  follow  them.  A  ﬂexible  military
organization with ﬂexible doctrine, however, can be constrained by inﬂexible hardware and software. Thus an
emerging C3 emphasis is a technical focus on modular equipments, standard interfaces between equipments,
“open system” architectures, and (software) programmable equipments.
