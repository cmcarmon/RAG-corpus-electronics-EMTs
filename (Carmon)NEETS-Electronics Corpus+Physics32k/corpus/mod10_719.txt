In figure 4-29, view A, elements A and B are perpendicular to the plane represented by the page; 
therefore, only the ends of the antennas appear. In view B the antennas are rotated a quarter of a circle in 
space around the QQ1 axis so that they are seen in the plane of the elements themselves. Therefore, the 
PP1 axis, now perpendicular to the page, is not seen as a line. The RR1 axis, now seen as a line, is 
perpendicular to the PP1 axis as well as to the QQ1 axis. The end-fire array is directional in this plane 
also, although not quite as sharply. The reason for the greater broadness of the lobes can be seen by 
following the path of energy radiating from the midpoint of element B toward point S in view B. This 
energy passes the A element at one end after traveling slightly more than the perpendicular distance 
between the dipoles. Energy, therefore, does not combine in exact phase toward point S. Although 
maximum radiation cannot take place in this direction, energy from the two sources combines closely 
enough in phase to produce considerable reinforcement. A similar situation exists for wavefronts traveling 
toward T. However, the wider angle from Q to T produces a greater phase difference and results in a 
decrease in the strength of the combined wave.
