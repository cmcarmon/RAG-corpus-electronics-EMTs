drop in current, the voltage drop across RS is 18 volts; consequently, the output of the regulator has 
increased to 102 volts. At this time, the regulating device (RV) decreases in resistance, and 6 amperes of 
current flows through this resistance (RV). Thus, the total current RS is once again 10 amperes (6 amperes 
through RV; 4 amperes through RL). Therefore, 20 volts is dropped across RS causing the output to 
decrease back to 100 volts. You should know by now that if the load resistance (RL) increases, the 
regulating device (RV) decreases its resistance to compensate for the change. If RL decreases, the opposite 
effect occurs and RV increases.
