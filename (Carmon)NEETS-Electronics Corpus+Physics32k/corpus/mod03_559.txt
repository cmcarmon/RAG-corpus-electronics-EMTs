A SOLENOID is a control device that uses electromagnetism to convert electrical energy into a
mechanical motion. The magnetic field of the coil and core will attract the plunger of a solenoid when
current flows through the coil. When current is removed, the spring attached to the plunger will cause the
plunger to return to its original position.
