Experimental Results
The algorithms in Figure 8.9 were coded for the FPGA model of
single-length segments and tested on a number of benchmark
circuits (obtained from the University of Toronto FPGA group)
ranging from about 80 cells and nets to about 500 cells and nets.
The input to the incremental routing software of Dutt et al.
(1999) is the mapped and routed circuits produced by the
Toronto’s group SEGA tools (Lemieux and Brown, 1993). Two
important metrics, track overhead and reconﬁguration time
(essentially, rerouting time), are the focus of these experiments.
