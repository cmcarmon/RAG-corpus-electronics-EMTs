As mentioned before, the true power of a circuit is the power actually used in the circuit. This power, 
measured in watts, is the power associated with the total resistance in the circuit. To calculate true power, 
the voltage and current associated with the resistance must be used. Since the voltage drop across the 
resistance is equal to the resistance multiplied by the current through the resistance, true power can be 
calculated by the formula:
