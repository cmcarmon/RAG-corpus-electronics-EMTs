The rtty mode of transmission and reception is rapidly becoming more efficient and reliable for 
communications between ships and from ship-to-shore. Ships copy what is known as "fleet broadcast" 
messages on rtty. The speed at which message traffic is transmitted on rtty circuits depends on the 
equipment in use. Normal speed of operation is 100 words per minute, but it may be faster or slower. You 
may find high-speed equipment, capable of printing a line or even a page at a time, in some 
communications centers. The use of rtty has brought about a considerable savings in manpower.
