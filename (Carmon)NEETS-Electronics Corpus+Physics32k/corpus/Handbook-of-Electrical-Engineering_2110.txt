Advanced Signal Processing
Adaptive Beamforming
Beamforming was discussed in an earlier section. The cancellation of noise through beamforming can also be
done adaptively, which can improve the array gain further. Some of the various adaptive beamforming tech-
niques are [Knight et al., 1981], Dicanne, sidelobe cancellers, maximum entropy array processing, and maxi-
mum-likelihood (ML) array processing.
