Mechanical and fusion splicing are two broad categories that describe the techniques used for fiber
splicing. Amechanical splice is a fiber splice where mechanical fixtures and materials perform fiber
alignment and connection. A fusion splice is a fiber splice where localized heat fuses or melts the ends of
two optical fibers together. Each splicing technique seeks to optimize splice performance and reduce
splice loss. Low-loss fiber splicing results from proper fiber end preparation and alignment.
