Most commercial applications of electrostriction involve high-permittivity materials such as relaxor ferroelec-
trics. PMN (Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3) relaxor ferroelectric compounds were ﬁrst synthesized more than 30 years ago.
Since then, the PMN system has been well characterized in both single-crystal and ceramic forms, and may be
considered the prototype ferroelectric electrostrictor [Jang et al., 1980]. Lead titanate (PbTiO3, PT) and other
materials are commonly added to PMN to shift Tmax or increase the maximum dielectric constant. The addition
of PT to PMN gives rise to a range of compositions, the PMN–PT system, that have a higher Curie range and
superior electromechanical coupling coefﬁcients. The addition of other oxide compounds, mostly other ferro-
electrics, is a widely used method to tailor the electromechanical properties of electrostrictors [Voss et al., 1983].
Some properties of the PMN–PT system are listed here.
