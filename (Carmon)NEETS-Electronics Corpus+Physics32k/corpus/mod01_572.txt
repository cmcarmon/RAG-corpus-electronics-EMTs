The total current of 10 amperes, as illustrated in figure 3-40(B), leaves the negative terminal of the
battery and flows to point a. Since point a is a connecting point for the two resistors, it is called a
JUNCTION. At junction a, the total current divides into two currents of 5 amperes each. These two
currents flow through their respective resistors and rejoin at junction b. The total current then flows from
junction b back to the positive terminal of the source. The source supplies a total current of 10 amperes
and each of the two equal resistors carries one-half the total current.
