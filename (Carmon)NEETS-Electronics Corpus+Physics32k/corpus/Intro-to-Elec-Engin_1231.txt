13.1.14 A dc machine, operating as a generator, develops
400 V at its armature terminals, corresponding to
a ﬁeld current of 4 A, when the rotor is driven at
1200 r/min and the armature current is zero.
(a) If the machine produces 20 kW of electro-
magnetic power, ﬁnd the corresponding ar-
mature current and the electromagnetic
torque produced.
