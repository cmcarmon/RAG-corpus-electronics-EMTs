Circuit measurement is used to monitor the operation of an electrical or electronic device, or to
determine the reason a device is not operating properly. Since electricity is invisible, you must use some
sort of device to determine what is happening in an electrical circuit. Various devices called test
equipment are used to measure electrical quantities. The most common types of test equipment use some
kind of metering device.
