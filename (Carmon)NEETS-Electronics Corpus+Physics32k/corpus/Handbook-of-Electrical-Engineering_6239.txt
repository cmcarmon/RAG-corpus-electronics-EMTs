Up to this time, the television process attempted to transmit an image converted to an electrical signal
by  scanning  with  mechanically  moving  apparatus  during  the  brief  time  period  the  human  eye  would
retain a picture. Such equipment could not move at sufﬁcient speed to provide full-shaded images to the
viewer. At the age of 20, Farnsworth succeeded in producing the ﬁrst all-electronic television image. It
took  more  that  two  decades  to  be  adopted  for  consumer  use,  but  it  is  easy  to  see  how  important  this
invention has become in today’s society. (Copyright © 1995, DewRay Products, Inc. Used with permission.)
