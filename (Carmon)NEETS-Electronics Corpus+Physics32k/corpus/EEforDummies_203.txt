Because the current in a series circuit has only one path to flow through, you 
may run into a potential problem with this type of circuit. If one component 
fails, it creates an open circuit, stopping the flow of current to every other 
component in the circuit. So if your expensive new restaurant sign sports 
200 LEDs wired in series to say “BEST FOOD IN TOWN,” and a home‐run ball 
knocks out one LED, every one of the LEDs goes dark.
