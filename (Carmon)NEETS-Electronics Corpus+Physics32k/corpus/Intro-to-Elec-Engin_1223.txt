The power coefﬁcient Cp of wind turbines varies with the tip-speed ratio λ, as shown in
Figure 13.6.1. Maximum power transfer is achieved by ensuing operation of λopt, where the
turbine is most efﬁcient. The mechanical power Pm available at the shaft of the wind turbine may
be expressed as a function of the wind speed v and the shaft speed w,
Pm(v, w) = C1vw2 + C2v2w + C3v3
