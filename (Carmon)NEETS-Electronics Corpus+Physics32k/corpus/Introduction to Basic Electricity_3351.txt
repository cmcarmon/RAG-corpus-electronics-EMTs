that both alternations of each cycle are made to flow 
in the same direction before being applied to the SCR.
Figure 33-8 shows a simple variable half-wave cir-
cuit. The circuit provides a phase shift from 0 to 90 
electrical degrees of the anode voltage signal. Diode 
D1 blocks the reverse gate voltage on the negative half-
cycle of the anode supply voltage.
