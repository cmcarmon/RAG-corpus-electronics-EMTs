Among land transportation vehicles, there are more subdivisions than the lay person might expect. In general,
distinctions are based on vehicle size, weight, speed, and passenger or cargo capacity. Cars, trucks, mini-vans,
vans, sport utility vehicles, etc. are familiar terms. There is some variation among them relative to the electronics
embedded  in  the  systems  and  the  options  available  to  the  driver.  The  same  is  true  for  railroads,  rail  transit,
and  mass  transit,  although  the  distinctions  among  classiﬁcations  are  important  to  the  manufacturers  and
operators of the equipment. The classiﬁcations include railroad, commuter rail, heavy rail, light rail, street car,
trolley bus, bus, paratransit, and “people mover” or monorail.
