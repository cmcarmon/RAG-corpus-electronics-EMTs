Electrical energy is converted to acoustic waves in ultrasonic applications by means of electro-acoustic trans-
ducers. Most transducers are reciprocal in that they will also convert the mechanical energy in acoustic waves
into  electrical  energy.  The  form  of  the  transducer  is  very  application  dependent.  Categories  of  applications
include imaging, wherein one transducer is used to create an acoustic beam, discontinuities in the propagating
medium  scatter  this  beam,  and  the  scattered  energy  is  captured  by  the  same  or  another  transducer  [see
Fig. 48.4(b)]. From the changes of the scattered energy as the beam is moved, characteristics of the scatterer
are determined. This is the process in the use of ultrasonics for nondestructive evaluation (NDE), ï¬‚aw detection,
for example, and in ultrasonic images for medical diagnosis. These are radar-like applications and are practical
at reasonable frequencies because most solids and liquids support acoustic waves with tolerable losses and the
wavelength is short enough that the resolution is adequate for practical targets. By recording both the amplitude
and  phase  of  the  scattered  signal  as  the  transmitter-receiver  combination  is  rotated  about  a  target,  one  can
generate tomographic-type images of the target.
