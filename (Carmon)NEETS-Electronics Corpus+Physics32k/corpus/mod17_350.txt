The length of time required to transmit the entire character is called the CHARACTER INTERVAL. 
Character interval becomes very important in some transmissions because certain items of equipment are 
character length conscious or code conscious. Stop unit intervals of various lengths are used or produced 
by various equipment (1.0, 1.27, 1.5, 1.96, 2.0, and so forth). Basically, the only difference between them 
is the length of time required to transmit one character.
