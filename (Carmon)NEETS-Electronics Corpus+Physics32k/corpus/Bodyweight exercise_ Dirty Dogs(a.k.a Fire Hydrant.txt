The individual starts in an all-fours position, then lifts one knee off the ground and swings the knee out to the side as far as possible, maintaining the bent knee at a 90-degree angle. The leg is then returned to the starting position and the exercise is then performed with the other leg.
The Mule Kick variant is performed by straightening the leg as it is lifted away from the body as high as possible.
