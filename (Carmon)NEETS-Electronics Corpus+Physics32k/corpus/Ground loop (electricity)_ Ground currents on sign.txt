The symptoms of a ground loop, ground noise and hum in electrical equipment, are caused by current flowing in the ground or "shield" conductor of a cable. Fig. 1 shows a signal cable S linking two electronic components, including the typical line driver and receiver amplifiers (triangles). The cable has a ground or shield conductor which is connected to the chassis ground of each component. The driver amplifier in component 1 (left) applies signal V1 between the signal and ground conductors of the cable. At the destination end (right), the signal and ground conductors are connected to a differential amplifier. This produces the signal input to component 2 by subtracting the shield voltage from the signal voltage to eliminate common-mode noise picked up by the cable

{\displaystyle V_{2}=V_{\text{S2}}-V_{\text{G2}}\,}

If a current I from a separate source is flowing through the ground conductor, the resistance R of the conductor will create a voltage drop along the cable ground of IR, so the destination end of the ground conductor will be at a different potential than the source end

Since the differential amplifier has high impedance, little current flows in the signal wire, therefore there is no voltage drop across it:

{\displaystyle V_{\text{S2}}=V_{\text{S1}}\,}
The ground voltage appears to be in series with the signal voltage V1 and adds to it

If I is an AC current this can result in noise added to the signal path in component 2. In effect the ground current "tricks" the component into thinking it is in the signal path.
