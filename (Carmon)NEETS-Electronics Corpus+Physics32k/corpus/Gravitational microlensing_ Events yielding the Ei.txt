In principle, the Einstein parallax can be measured by having two observers simultaneously observe the event from different locations, e.g., from the earth and from a distant spacecraft. The difference in amplification observed by the two observers yields the component of

{\displaystyle {\vec {\pi }}_{E}}
perpendicular to the motion of the lens while the difference in the time of peak amplification yields the component parallel to the motion of the lens. This direct measurement was recently reported using the Spitzer Space Telescope. In extreme cases, the differences may even be measurable from small differences seen from telescopes at different locations on the earth.
More typically, the Einstein parallax is measured from the non-linear motion of the observer caused by the rotation of the earth about the sun. It was first reported in 1995 and has been reported in a handful of events since. Parallax in point-lens events can best be measured in long-timescale events with a large

—from slow-moving, low mass lenses which are close to the observer.
If the source star is a binary star, then it too will have a non-linear motion which can also cause slight, but detectable changes in the light curve. This effect is known as Xallarap (parallax spelled backwards).
