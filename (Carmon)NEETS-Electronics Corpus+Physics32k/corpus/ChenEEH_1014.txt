When scaling the supply voltage down, one can compensate
for the speed loss by altering the device threshold voltage.
Reducing the Vt (achieved by changing the substrate and
channel dopant concentrations) allows the supply voltage to
be scaled down without loss in speed. Unfortunately, such
scaling leads to an exponential increase in the subthreshold
leakage current (Wei et al., 2000). The limit of how low the Vt
can go is determined by the requirement to set adequate noise
margins and control the increase in subthreshold leakage cur-
rents, as shown in Figure 5.13. The optimum Vt must be
determined based on the current drives at low supply voltage
operation and control of the leakage currents (Pedram, 1995).
If the threshold voltage is reduced, then the whole characteris-
tic curve moves toward the left, as Figure 5.8 illustrates. Thus
for low threshold voltages, the device cannot be properly
switched off (when Vgs ¼ 0 V ) and there is signiﬁcant short
circuit current. The subthreshold currents can result in signiﬁ-
cant static power dissipation. Essentially, subthreshold leakage
occurs due to carrier diffusion between the source and the
drain when the gate-source voltage Vgs has exceeded the weak
inversion point but is still below the threshold voltage Vt ,
where drift is dominant.
