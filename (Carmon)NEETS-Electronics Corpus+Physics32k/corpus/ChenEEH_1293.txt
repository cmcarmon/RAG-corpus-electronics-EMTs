Bus technology is well-developed in computer systems such as
PCs. Most of the busses described here are common in a
typical PC-based system. However, some busses such as PCL
are also used in Sun Microcomputer systems. In 1982, the Ô¨Årst-
generation PCs used ISA busses. The ISA bus was an 8-bit bus
running at 4.77 MHz on PC XT. Although it was extended to a
16-bit bus with the speed of 8 MHz on PC AT, the low speed
led to extended industry standard architecture bus (EISA)
design. At the same time, micro channel architecture (MCA)
bus was added by IBM to provide users with choices. Newer
Intel486TM and Pentium processor-based machines offer ISA/
PCI or EISA/PCI. With most vendors now shipping PCI-based
machines across their complete product line, it is clear that
PCI will be the dominant bus for the future. Furthermore,
the transition of corporate PC purchases to Pentium proces-
sor-based systems hastens the move to PCI for the adapter
interface. This move allows for better response time for
PCs, which eliminates the bottlenecks for these high-powered
workstations.
