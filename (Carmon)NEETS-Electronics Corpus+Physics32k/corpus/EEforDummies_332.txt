That double squiggle symbol (≈) in the equation just given means “is approxi-
mately equal to,” and I used that because I rounded off the current to the 
nearest tenth of a milliamp. It’s usually okay to round off the tinier parts of 
values in electronics — unless you’re working on the electronics that control 
a subatomic particle smasher or other high‐precision industrial device.
