The amount of time given to each player to complete their moves will vary from game to game. However most games tend to change the classification of tournaments according to the length of time given to the players. Shorter time limits, which do not afford due consideration to moves, are afforded a lesser degree of importance. Indeed, shorter limits are normally given special names to distinguish them.
In chess, the categories of time limits are: 'lightning', 'bullet', 'blitz', and 'rapid'. 'Lightning' games are the fastest, with either a very short time limit per move (such as ten seconds) or a very short total time (such as one minute). 'Bullet' games typically give two or three minutes per player. 'Blitz' games typically give five to ten minutes per player, and 'rapid' games give between ten and sixty minutes. By way of contrast, for Go anything under twenty minutes could be considered blitz.
