zero with time also decays to zero. Instability can come about in various ways, and it is a
very common difﬁculty, which must be prevented. In almost all cases, op-amp circuits can be
classiﬁed as feedback circuits. Feedback of an improper kind can lead to instability or oscillation
of an op-amp circuit. In general, instability occurs when there is excessive phase shift in the
op amp and feedback loop, so that negative feedback is changed to positive feedback. The
frequency response of an op amp is usually designed to roll off smoothly at 20 dB decade,
as mentioned earlier. This type of frequency response ensures stability for the more common
op-amp circuits.
