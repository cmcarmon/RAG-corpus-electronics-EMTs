Microswitch with actuator driven by a diaphragm. May be used to sense 
differential pressure. Alternatively, one chamber may be evacuated and 
the sensed pressure applied to a second input. 
Pressure exerted on diaphragm causes changes of resistance in attached 
piezo-resistive transducers. Transducers are usually arranged in the form 
of  a  four  active  element  bridge  which  produces  an  analogue  output 
voltage.  
Reed switch and permanent magnet actuator. Only effective over short 
distances.
