The polar-coordinate graph now shows a definite area enclosed by the radiation pattern. This pattern 
indicates the general direction of radiation from the source. The enclosed area is called a LOBE. Outside 
of this area, minimum radiation is emitted in any direction. For example, at position 2 the radiation is 0. 
Such a point is called a NULL. In real situations, some radiation is usually transmitted in all directions. 
Therefore, a null is used to indicate directions of minimum radiation. The pattern of figure 4-12 shows 
one lobe and one continuous null.
