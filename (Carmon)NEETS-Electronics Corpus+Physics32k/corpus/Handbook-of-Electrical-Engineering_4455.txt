ampliﬁers. Both PIN diodes and GaAs MESFET devices are used for variable attenuators. Figure 43.10(c) shows
a variable attenuator conﬁguration using MESFETs in the passive mode. Apart from the use of MESFETs in
Dual-
the passive mode, active MESFET ampliﬁer circuits may also be used for variable attenuation circuits.

  ampliﬁers  with  controlled  voltage  applied  to  the  second  gate  are  ideal  for  this  purpose  and
provide a lower noise ﬁgure than the passive attenuators.
