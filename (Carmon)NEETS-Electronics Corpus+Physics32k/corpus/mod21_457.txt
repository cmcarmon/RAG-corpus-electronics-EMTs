close together with reference to the unit under test. The output of the system under test (an amplifier,
receiver, or transmitter) is monitored on a spectrum analyzer that is comparable in characteristics to the
suspect system. The resultant display should be an exact reproduction of the input frequencies. If not,
some form of intermodulation distortion is present. To determine if external sources are causing the
intermodulation distortion, you can use a single-frequency signal. If the display on the spectrum analyzer
does not show the single frequency, then intermodulation distortion is present.
