Letâ€™s put the facts together. The filament is hot and electrons boil from its surface. Because the
filament is the only heated element in the diode, it is the ONLY source of electrons within the space
between filament and plate. However, because the plate is NEGATIVE and the electrons are
NEGATIVE, the electrons are repelled back to the filament. Remember that LIKE CHARGES REPEL.
If electrons cannot flow across the space, then no electrons can flow anywhere in the plate circuit. The
ammeter therefore indicates ZERO.
