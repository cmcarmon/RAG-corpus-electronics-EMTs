Media in motion were the ﬁrst bianisotropic media to receive attention in electromagnetic theory. In 1888,
Roentgen discovered that a moving dielectric becomes magnetized when it is placed in an electric ﬁeld. In 1905,
Wilson showed that a moving dielectric in a uniform magnetic ﬁeld becomes electrically polarized. Almost any
medium becomes bianisotropic when it is in motion.
