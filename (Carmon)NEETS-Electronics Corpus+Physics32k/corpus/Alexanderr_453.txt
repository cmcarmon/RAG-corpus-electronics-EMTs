To  verify  the  polarity  of  the  voltage  source  and  the  direction  of
the current source, we may apply mesh currents 
(all in the
clockwise  direction)  in  the  original  circuit  in  Fig.  8.48.  The  10-V
so  that  its  dual  is  a
voltage  source  produces  positive  mesh  current 
10-A current source directed from 0 to 1. Also, 
in Fig. 8.48
has as its dual
