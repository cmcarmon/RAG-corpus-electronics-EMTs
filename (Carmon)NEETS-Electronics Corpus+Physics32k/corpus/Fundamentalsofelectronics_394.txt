Let’s return to the question of equality; how can the equal sign in the deﬁnition of the Fourier series be
justiﬁed? The partial answer is that point wise—each and every value of t—equality is not guaranteed.
However, mathematicians later in the nineteenth century showed that the rms error of the Fourier series was
always zero.
