The v0
the stopband of
B(v) ¼ jE(v)j. The passband values of B(v) and ^BB(v) are
left unchanged in equation 2.67 to preserve the equiripple
property of the minimax method, although it does not have
to be that way. The parameter L is the single design parameter
for the proposed scheme. Choosing L ¼ 1 makes the new
scheme similar
to an equiripple-passband WLS design,
whereas choosing L to be as large as possible (i.e., making
L ¼ p), we return to the original minimax algorithms.
