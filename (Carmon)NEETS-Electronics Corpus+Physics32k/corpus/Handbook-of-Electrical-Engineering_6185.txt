M-ary Phase-Shift Keying
If  the  transmitter  is  a  PM  transmitter  with  an  M-level  digital  modulation  signal,  MPSK  is  generated  at  the
transmitter  output. A  plot  of  the  permitted  values  of  the  complex  envelope, g(t)  = Ace jq(t),  would  contain  M
points, one value of g (a complex number in general) for each of the M multilevel values, corresponding to the
M phases that q is permitted to have.
