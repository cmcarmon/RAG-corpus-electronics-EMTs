Normally the frames used to describe a vehicle's local observations are the same frames used to describe its attitude respect the ground tracking stations. i.e. if an ENU frame is used in a tracking station, also ENU frames are used onboard and these frames are also used to refer local observations.
An important case in which this does not apply is aircraft. Aircraft observations are performed downwards and therefore normally NED axes convention applies. Nevertheless, when attitudes respect ground stations are given, a relationship between the local earth-bound frame and the onboard ENU frame is used.
