is a graph with junction points called nodes which are connected by directed line segments called branches
with signals traveling along the branches only in the direction described by the arrows of the branches.
A signal xk traveling along a branch between xk and xj is multiplied by the gain of the branches gkj, so
that a signal gkj xk is delivered at node xj. An input node (source) is a node which contains only outgoing
branches;  an  output  node  (sink)  is  a  node  which  has  only  incoming  branches. A  path  is  a  continuous
unidirectional succession of branches, all of which are traveling in the same direction; a forward path is
a path from the input node to the output node along which all nodes are encountered exactly once; and
a feedback path (loop) is a closed path which originates from and terminates at the same node, and along
with all other nodes are encountered exactly once (the trivial case is a self-loop which contains exactly
one node and one branch). A path gain is the product of all the branch gains of the branches in a loop.
