The aperture-coupled geometry affords several degrees of freedom for control of the electrical properties of
the antenna. The slot size (length) primarily determines the coupling level and, hence, the input impedance.
Tightest coupling occurs when the slot is centered below the patch, with the input impedance decreasing as
the  slot  size  is  decreased. As  with  any  microstrip  antenna,  the  resonant  frequency  is  controlled  primarily  by
the length of the patch. The feed line stub length can be used to adjust the reactance loading of the element,
and the antenna substrate thickness and dielectric constant has a direct effect on the bandwidth of the element.
It is also possible to use the slot to provide a double tuning effect to increase signiÔ¨Åcantly impedance bandwidth.
Such aperture-coupled antennas have been demonstrated with bandwidths up to 40% [Pozar and Schaubert,
1995]. Another unique feature of the aperture coupled patch is that the principal plane patterns have theoret-
ically zero cross polarization because of the symmetry of the element.
