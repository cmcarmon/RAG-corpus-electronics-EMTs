Nonlinear Receivers
When amplitude distortion is present in the channel, a memoryless detector operating on the output of this receiver
Ô¨Ålter no longer minimizes symbol error probability. Recognizing this fact, several authors have investigated optimum
or approximately optimum nonlinear receiver structures subject to a variety of criteria [Lucky, 1973].
