The geodesic equations are readily obtained from the geodesic Lagrangian. As always, these are second order nonlinear ordinary differential equations.
If we set

{\displaystyle \theta =\pi /2}
we find that test particle motion confined to the equatorial plane is possible, and in this case first integrals (first order ordinary differential equations) are readily obtained. First, we have

{\displaystyle {\dot {t}}=E\,\left(1+m/r\right)^{2}\approx E\,\left(1+2m/r\right)}

where to first order in m we have the same result as for the Schwarzschild vacuum. This also shows that Nordström's theory agrees with the result of the Pound–Rebka experiment. Second, we have

{\displaystyle {\dot {\phi }}=L/r^{2}}

which is the same result as for the Schwarzschild vacuum. This expresses conservation of orbital anglar momentum of test particles moving in the equatorial plane, and shows that the period of a nearly circular orbit (as observed by a distant observer) will be same as for the Schwarzschild vacuum. Third, with
