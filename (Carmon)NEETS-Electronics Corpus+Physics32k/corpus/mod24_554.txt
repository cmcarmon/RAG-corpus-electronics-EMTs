OTDRs are equipped with either manual or automatic cursors to locate points of interest along the
trace. In figure 5-14, a cursor is positioned at a distance zo on the rising edge of the reflection at the end of
the dead-zone fiber. Cursors are also positioned at distances z1 and z2. The cursor positioned at z1 is just
beyond the recovery from the reflection at the end of the dead-zone fiber. Since no point defects are
present in figure 5-14, the cursor positioned at z2 locates the end of the test fiber. Cursor z2 is positioned
just before the output pulse resulting from Fresnel reflection occurring at the end of the test fiber.
