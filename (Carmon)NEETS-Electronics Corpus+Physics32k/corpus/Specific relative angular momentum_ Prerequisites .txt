The following is only valid under the simplifications also applied to Newton's law of universal gravitation.
One looks at two point masses




m

{\displaystyle m_{1}}
and




m

2




{\displaystyle m_{2}}
, at the distance



r


{\displaystyle r}
from one another and with the gravitational force

r




{\displaystyle {\vec {F}}=G{\frac {m_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}}{\frac {\vec {r}}{r}}}
acting between them. This force acts instantly, over any distance and is the only force present. The coordinate system is inertial.
The further simplification




m

≫

m

2




{\displaystyle m_{1}\gg m_{2}}
is assumed in the following. Thus




m

1




{\displaystyle m_{1}}
is the central body in the origin of the coordinate system and




m

2




{\displaystyle m_{2}}
is the satellite orbiting around it. Now the reduced mass is also equal to




m

2




{\displaystyle m_{2}}
and the equation of the two-body problem is









r

r

r




{\displaystyle {\ddot {\vec {r}}}=-{\frac {\mu }{r^{2}}}{\frac {\vec {r}}{r}}}

with the Standard gravitational parameter



μ

m

{\displaystyle \mu =Gm_{1}}
and the distance vector






r
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {r}}}
(absolute value



r


{\displaystyle r}
) that points from the origin (central body) to the satellite, because of its negligible mass.
It is important not to confound the gravitational parameter



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }
with the reduced mass, which is sometimes also denoted by the same letter



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }
.
