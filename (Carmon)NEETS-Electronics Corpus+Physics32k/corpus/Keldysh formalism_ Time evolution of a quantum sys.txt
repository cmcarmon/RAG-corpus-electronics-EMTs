Consider a general quantum mechanical system. This system has the Hamiltonian




H

0




{\displaystyle H_{0}}
. Let the ground state of the system with respect to this Hamiltonian be




|

0
⟩


{\displaystyle |0\rangle }
. If we now add a time-dependent perturbation to this Hamiltonian, say




H
′

(
t
)


{\displaystyle H'(t)}
, the state will no more be the ground state for the full Hamiltonian



H
(
t
)
=

H

0


+

H
′

(
t
)


{\displaystyle H(t)=H_{0}+H'(t)}
and hence the system will evolve in time towards an equilibrium state under the full Hamiltonian. In this section, we will see how time evolution actually works in quantum mechanics.
Let us consider a Hermitian operator





O




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}}
. In the Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics, this operator is time-dependent and the state is not. We are interested in the average



⟨


O


(
t
)
⟩


{\displaystyle \langle {\mathcal {O}}(t)\rangle }
. In the natural units, if we define the time-evolution operator as



U
(
t
,
0
)
=

e

−
i

∫

0


t


H
(

t
′

)
d

t
′





{\displaystyle U(t,0)=e^{-i\int _{0}^{t}H(t')dt'}}
, then the average of the operator





O


(
t
)


{\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}(t)}
is given by








⟨


O


(
t
)
⟩



=
⟨
0

U

†


(
t
,
0
)



O



U
(
t
,
0
)

|

0
⟩






{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\langle {\mathcal {O}}(t)\rangle &=\langle 0|U^{\dagger }(t,0)\,{\mathcal {O}}\,U(t,0)|0\rangle \\\end{aligned}}}

As can be seen, we need to use both the forward time evolution operator



U
(
t
,
0
)


{\displaystyle U(t,0)}
as well as the backward time evolution operator




U

†


(
t
,
0
)


{\displaystyle U^{\dagger }(t,0)}
. But usually, only the forward time evolution is considered. This is done by assuming that




H
′

(
t
)


{\displaystyle H'(t)}
obeys the adiabatic theorem. This is basically saying that the perturbation




H
′

(
t
)


{\displaystyle H'(t)}
is turned on slowly as



t


{\displaystyle t}
increases from



0


{\displaystyle 0}
and it is also turned off slowly as



t


{\displaystyle t}
approaches



∞


{\displaystyle \infty }
.
This forward as well as backward time evolution is a characteristic feature of Keldysh formalism.
