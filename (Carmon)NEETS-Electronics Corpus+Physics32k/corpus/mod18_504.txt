Many other supply voltages are used in radar systems and subsystems. They are usually used as 
reference voltages for specific functions. When you are missing a power input to your equipment, work 
backwards from the load to the source. Usually, the power panels and bus transfer units that feed the 
equipment are located nearby, possibly in the same space or in a passageway.
