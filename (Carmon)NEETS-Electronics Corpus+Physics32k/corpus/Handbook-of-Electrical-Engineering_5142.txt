Electroplastic Effect
The 
(EPE) refers to the plastic deformation of metals with the application of high-density
electric current with an enhanced deformation rate (that persists in addition to that caused by the side effects
of  the  current  such  as  joule-heating  and  the  magnetic  pinch  effect).  The  plastic  strain  rate  resulting  from  a

 are material constants.
J
is the strain rate in the absence of the current pulse, 
 is the current density and 
Typically the EPE has been observed in zinc, niobium, titanium, etc.
