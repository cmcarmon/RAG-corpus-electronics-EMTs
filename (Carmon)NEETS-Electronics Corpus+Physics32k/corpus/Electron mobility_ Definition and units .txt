The electron mobility is defined by the equation:






v

d


=
μ
E


{\displaystyle \,v_{d}=\mu E}
.
where:
E is the magnitude of the electric field applied to a material,
vd is the magnitude of the electron drift velocity (in other words, the electron drift speed) caused by the electric field, and
µ is the electron mobility.
The hole mobility is defined by the same equation. Both electron and hole mobilities are positive by definition.
Usually, the electron drift velocity in a material is directly proportional to the electric field, which means that the electron mobility is a constant (independent of electric field). When this is not true (for example, in very large electric fields), the mobility depends on the electric field.
The SI unit of velocity is m/s, and the SI unit of electric field is V/m. Therefore the SI unit of mobility is (m/s)/(V/m) = m2/(V·s). However, mobility is much more commonly expressed in cm2/(V·s) = 10−4 m2/(V·s).
Mobility is usually a strong function of material impurities and temperature, and is determined empirically. Mobility values are typically presented in table or chart form. Mobility is also different for electrons and holes in a given semiconductor.
