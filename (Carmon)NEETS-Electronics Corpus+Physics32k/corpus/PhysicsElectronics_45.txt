It is common, but not always necessary, to connect some part of the circuit to earth or
ground, which is taken, for convenience and by convention, to be at zero volts. Frequently, a
common (or reference) connection of the metal chassis of the instrument suï¬ƒces. Sometimes
there is a common reference voltage that is not at 0 V. Figure 1.2 show some common ways
of depicting grounds on a circuit diagram.
