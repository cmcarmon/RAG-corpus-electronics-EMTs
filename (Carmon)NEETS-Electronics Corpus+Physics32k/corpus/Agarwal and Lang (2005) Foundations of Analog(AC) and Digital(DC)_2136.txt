We know that for most Op Amps, A will be 100,000 or larger, and the
maximum allowed vo will be about 12 V (see Figure 15.3c). Hence the largest
value of (v
) for linear operation will be around 120 mV, a voltage orders-
of-magnitude smaller than either the input or the output voltage. On this basis
