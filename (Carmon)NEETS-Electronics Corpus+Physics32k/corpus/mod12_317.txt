Phase-shift keying (psk) is similar to ON-OFF cw keying in AM systems and frequency-shift keying
in fm systems. Psk is most useful when the code elements are all of equal length; that is, all marks and
spaces, whether message elements or synchronizing signals, occupy identical elements of time. It is not
fully suitable for use on start-stop teletypewriter circuits where the stop pulse is 1.42 times longer than the
