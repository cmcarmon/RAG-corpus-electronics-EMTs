LAN Market Factors
Personal Computer Explosion
The move from mainframe and central information processing of the 1960s and 1970s provided an opportunity
for minicomputers to enter the market. The minicomputer provided greater computer and applications access
by employees. Throughout the 1980s the move to more intelligent desktop devices like personal computers was
just  thatâ€”personal.  Organizations,  in  an  effort  to  empower  the  worker,  provided  all  types  of  applications,
software,  and  hardware  to  the  worker.  The  decremental  costs  of  technology  facilitated  the  distribution  of
personal computers. More importantly, projections state that business personal computer growth will continue
its aggressive pace (see Fig. 75.4).
