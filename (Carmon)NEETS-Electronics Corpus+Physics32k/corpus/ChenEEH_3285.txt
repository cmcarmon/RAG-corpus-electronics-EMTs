where If is the ﬁeld current, um is the angle of the rotor relative
to the armature, and Kf
is a constant that depends on the
number of windings and the physical properties of the ma-
chine. The machine may have several poles so that the arma-
ture will ‘‘see’’ multiple rotations for each turn of the rotor. So,
for example, a four pole machine appears electrically to be
rotating twice as fast as two pole machine. For a machine
rotating at vm radions per second with p poles, the electric
frequency is as follows:
