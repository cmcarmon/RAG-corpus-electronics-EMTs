from an input of 1 volt to about 2.32 volts. In order to ensure that the amplifier
operates within this region of the curve, we must transform the input voltage
appropriately. As illustrated in Figure 7.25, one way of doing so is to boost the
signal that we want to amplify (for example, vA) with a DC offset (say, VX) so
that the amplifier operates in its saturation region even for negative excursions
of the input signal. Figure 7.26 shows the corresponding circuit that adds an
offset to the input signal by connecting a DC voltage source (VX) in series with
the input signal source (vA). In other words, we have
