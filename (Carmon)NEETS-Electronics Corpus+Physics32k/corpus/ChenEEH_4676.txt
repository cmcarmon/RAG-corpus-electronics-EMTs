speed variations and maintaining the capability of torque
disturbance rejection. One of the main difÔ¨Åculties of idle
speed control lies with the induction-to-torque delay; as an
additional challenge in this application, the desired idle speed
is set to 611 RPM instead of the normal (production) idle
speed of 740 RPM.
