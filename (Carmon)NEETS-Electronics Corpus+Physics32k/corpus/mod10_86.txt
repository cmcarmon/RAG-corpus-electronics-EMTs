The apparent change in frequency between the source of a wave and the receiver of the wave is
because of relative motion between the source and the receiver. To understand the Doppler effect, first
assume that the frequency of a sound from a source is held constant. The wavelength of the sound will
also remain constant. If both the source and the receiver of the sound remain stationary, the receiver will
