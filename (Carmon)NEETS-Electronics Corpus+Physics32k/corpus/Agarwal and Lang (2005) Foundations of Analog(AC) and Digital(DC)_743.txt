Yet another representation of boolean functions makes use of the combinational
gate abstraction. We will see how gates are built out of primitive lumped circuit
elements in Chapter 6. For now, let us focus on the gate-level abstraction. The
digital gate notation for the boolean equation Z = X AND Y is shown in
Figure 5.13.
