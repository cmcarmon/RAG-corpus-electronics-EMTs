For spheroid with semi-major axis



a


{\displaystyle a}
and semi-minor axis

{\displaystyle {\frac {\Omega ^{2}}{\pi G\rho }}={\frac {2{\sqrt {1-e^{2}}}}{e^{3}}}(3-2e^{2})\sin ^{-1}e-{\frac {6}{e^{2}}}(1-e^{2}),\quad e^{2}=1-{\frac {c^{2}}{a^{2}}},}

where



e


{\displaystyle e}
is the eccentricity of meridional cross-sections of the spheriod,



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
is the density and



G


{\displaystyle G}
is the Gravitational constant. The formula predicts two possible types of equilibrium figures when



Ω
→
0


{\displaystyle \Omega \rightarrow 0}
, one is a sphere (



e
→
0


{\displaystyle e\rightarrow 0}
) and the other is a flattened spheroid (



e
→
1


{\displaystyle e\rightarrow 1}
). The maximum angular velocity occurs at eccentricity



e
=
0.92995


{\displaystyle e=0.92995}
and its value is

=

{\displaystyle \Omega ^{2}/(\pi G\rho )=0.449331}
, so that above this speed, no equilibrium figures exist. But this contradicts our experience and the cause of this contradiction could be attributed two assumptions which are not realistic, one is homogeneous assumption and the other assumption is that the figures take a simple quadric shape.
