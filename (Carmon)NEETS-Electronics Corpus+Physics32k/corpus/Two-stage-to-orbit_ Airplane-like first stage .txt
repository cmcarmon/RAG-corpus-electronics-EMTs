TSTO designs comprise an airplane-like first stage and a rocket-like second stage. The airplane elements can be wings, air-breathing engines, or both. This approach appeals because it transforms Earth's atmosphere from an obstacle into an advantage. Above a certain speed and altitude, wings and scramjets cease being effective, and the rocket is deployed to complete the trip to orbit.
While not an orbital vehicle, the successful private SpaceShipOne suborbital spacecraft developed for the Ansari X Prize demonstrated that the problems of integrating a two-stage system, with a winged aircraft as the "lower half", that can reach the edge of space are not insurmountable. As of 2005, the team behind SpaceShipOne had built and flown a commercial sub-orbital launch system -- SpaceShipTwoâ€”based on this technology.
The Pegasus rocket while airplane launched, is not a two-stage-to-orbit system because the rocket component itself is composed of multiple stages.
