The MSC is a hierarchical scheme, with three levels of structure. A classification can be two, three or five digits long, depending on how many levels of the classification scheme are used.
The first level is represented by a two digit number, the second by a letter, and the third by another two digit number. For example:
53 is the classification for differential geometry
53A is the classification for classical differential geometry
53A45 is the classification for vector and tensor analysis
