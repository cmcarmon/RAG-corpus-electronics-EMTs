Figure 31.13 show an example of a charge-coupled device (CCD) linear photodiode array. The device consists
of a linear array of pn junction photodiodes. Each diode has capacitance associated with it, and when light falls
on the detector the resulting photocurrent charges this capacitance. The charge is thus the time integral of the
light  intensity  falling  on  the  diode.  The  CCD  periodically  and  sequentially  switches  the  charge  to  the  video
line, resulting in a series of pulses. These pulses can be converted to a voltage signal which represents the light
pattern incident on the array.
