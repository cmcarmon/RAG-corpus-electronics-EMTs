Transducer electrodes are fabricated from thin ﬁlm metal, usually aluminum, and are ﬁnite in width. This
metal  can  cause  discontinuities  to  the  surface  wave  which  cause  velocity  shifts  and  frequency-dependent
reﬂections. In addition, the ﬁlms have a given sheet resistance which gives rise to a parasitic electrode resistance
loss. The electrodes are designed to minimize these distortions in the device.
