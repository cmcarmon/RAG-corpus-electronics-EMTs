In addition to the topics in Sections 8.2 and 8.3, the voltage
control problem is another important topic because it is a
complex problem. It is mostly done by distributed automatic
local controls in the North American grid. However, some
European countries such as France do have automatic coordin-
ated voltage control schemes for the large network.
