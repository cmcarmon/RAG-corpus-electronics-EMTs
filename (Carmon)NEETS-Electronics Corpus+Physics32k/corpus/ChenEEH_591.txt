resistor that is the lateral resistance of the p-base. The equiva-
lent circuit model of the MOSFET, including the parasitic
transistor, is shown in Figure 7.14. Under rapid transients of
voltage at the drain, a displacement current is induced through
the parasitic capacitors of the MOSFET along two paths, as
shown. The current I1 may rise VGS above VTH , thus causing
spurious turn-on of the MOSFET. Likewise, the current I2 may
cause a resistive drop across RB that is high enough to turn the
parasitic bipolar transistor on. This places a limit on the
maximum dV/dt across the MOSFET. Reliability of MOSFET
is also affected by the power dissipation under transient con-
ditions. This power dissipation leads to a temperature rise in
the device. The temperature range of operation and highest
current and voltage stress are determined by the extent of
device self-heating.
