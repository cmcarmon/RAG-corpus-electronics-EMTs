The path that a refracted wave follows to the receiver depends on the angle at which the wave strikes 
the ionosphere. You should remember, however, that the rf energy radiated by a transmitting antenna 
spreads out with distance. The energy therefore strikes the ionosphere at many different angles rather than 
a single angle.
