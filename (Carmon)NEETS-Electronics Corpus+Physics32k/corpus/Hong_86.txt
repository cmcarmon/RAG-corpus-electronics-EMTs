As a circuit element, a BJT can be modeled as a combination of a diode (from 
base  to  emitter)  and  a  voltage-dependent  current  source  (from  collector  to  emitter)  as 
shown in Figure 7.5. The diode has an exponential current-voltage relationship and draws 
current equal to the base current,
