A length of 100 kilometres (about 62 miles), as a rough amount, is relatively common in measurements on Earth and for some astronomical objects. It is the altitude at which the FAI defines spaceflight to begin. To help compare orders of magnitude, this section lists lengths between 100 and 1,000 kilometres (105 and 106 metres).
