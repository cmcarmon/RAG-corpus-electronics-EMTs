Some types of lasers have two other advantages over other light sources: higher power and longer lifetime.
For  some  high-power  semiconductor  lasers,  lifetime  must  be  traded  off  against  higher  power,  but  for  most
others the life vs. power trade-off is minimal. The combination of high power and strong directionality makes
certain lasers the logical choice to deliver high light intensities to small areas. For some applications, lasers offer
longer lifetimes than do other light sources of comparable brightness and cost. In addition, despite their low
efﬁciency, some lasers may be more efﬁcient in converting energy to light than other light sources.
