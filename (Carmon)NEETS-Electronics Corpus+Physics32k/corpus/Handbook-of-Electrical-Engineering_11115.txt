Some experiments showing a resonant cell response at the frequency given by (113.21) could not be replicated,
while  others  were  performed  only  over  a  very  narrow  frequency  range.  Nevertheless,  apparently  successful
attempts have been made to stimulate bone cell proliferation at these ﬁeld combinations [Fitzsimmons et al.,
1991].  The  “Orthologic”  device  (H  in  Table  113.2)  employs  an  experimentally  determined  and  apparently
clinically useful combination of a 20 mT static ﬁeld with a 40 mT 76.6 Hz alternating ﬁeld. This frequency lies
near the ﬁfth harmonic (76.2 Hz) of the calcium ion resonance frequency given by Eq. (103.21); however, since
the device is always used in the presence of the geomagnetic ﬁeld of the order of 50 mT, the total DC magnetic
ﬁeld parallel to the 76.6 Hz ﬁeld can have any value between 0 and 70 mT which would essentially eliminate
unique determination of a 76.6 Hz “resonance”.
