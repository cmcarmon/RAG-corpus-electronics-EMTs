Figure 2-6  shows how a two-conductor cable is joined to a similar size cable by using a Western 
Union splice and by staggering the splices. Care should be taken to ensure that a short wire from one side 
of the cable is spliced to a long wire, from the other side of the cable. The sharp ends are then clamped 
firmly down on the conductor. The figure shows a Western Union splice, but other types of splices work 
just as well.
