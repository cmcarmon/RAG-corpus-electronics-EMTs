Inductors 
 
Inductors  provide  us  with  a  means  of  storing 
electrical  energy  in  the  form  of  a  magnetic  field. 
Typical applications include chokes, filters and (in 
conjunction with one or more capacitors) frequency 
selective  circuits.  The  electrical  characteristics  of 
an inductor are determined by a number of factors 
including  the  material  of  the  core  (if  any),  the 
number of turns, and the physical dimensions of the 
coil. Figure 2.35 shows the construction of a typical 
toroidal 
(high 
permeability) core.  
 
In practice every coil comprises both inductance 
(L) and  a  small  resistance  (R). The  circuit  of  Fig. 
2.36  shows  these  as  two  discrete  components.  In 
reality the inductance and the resistance (we often 
refer  to  this  as  a  loss  resistance  because  it’s 
something  that  we  don’t  actually  want)  are  both
