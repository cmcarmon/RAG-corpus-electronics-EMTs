The Zel'dovich number is a dimensionless number which provides a quantitative value for the activation energy of a chemical reaction which appears in the Arrhenius exponent, named after the Russian scientist Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich.
It is defined as




β
=



E

a



R

T

f





⋅




T

f


−

T

o




T

f






{\displaystyle \beta ={\frac {E_{a}}{RT_{f}}}\cdot {\frac {T_{f}-T_{o}}{T_{f}}}}

where





E

a




{\displaystyle E_{a}}
is the activation energy of the reaction




R


{\displaystyle R}
is the universal gas constant





T

f




{\displaystyle T_{f}}
is the flame temperature





T

o




{\displaystyle T_{o}}
is the unburnt mixture temperature.
In terms of heat release parameter



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }
, it is given by




β
=



E

a



R

T

f





α


{\displaystyle \beta ={\frac {E_{a}}{RT_{f}}}\alpha }

For typical combustion phenomena, the value for Zel'dovich number lies in the range



β
∼
8
−
20


{\displaystyle \beta \sim 8-20}
.
