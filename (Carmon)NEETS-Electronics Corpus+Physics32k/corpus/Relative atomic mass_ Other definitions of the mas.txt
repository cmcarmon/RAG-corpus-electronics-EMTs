Atomic mass (ma) is the mass of a single atom, with unit Da or u (the unified atomic mass unit). It defines the weight of a specific isotope, which is an input value for the determination of the relative atomic mass. An example for three silicon isotopes is given in determination of relative atomic mass
From this mass, the relative isotopic mass is specifically the ratio of the mass of a single atom to the mass of a unified atomic mass unit. This value too is relative, and so dimensionless.
