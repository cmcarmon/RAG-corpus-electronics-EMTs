The tube is full of marbles, just as a conductor is full of free electrons ready to be moved by
an outside inï¬‚uence. If a single marble is suddenly inserted into this full tube on the left-hand
side, another marble will immediately try to exit the tube on the right. Even though each
marble only traveled a short distance, the transfer of motion through the tube is virtually in-
stantaneous from the left end to the right end, no matter how long the tube is. With electricity,
the overall effect from one end of a conductor to the other happens at the speed of light: a swift
186,000 miles per second!!! Each individual electron, though, travels through the conductor at
a much slower pace.
