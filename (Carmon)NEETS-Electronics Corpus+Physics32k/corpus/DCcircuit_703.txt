It is worthy to reiterate the fact that this method, properly executed, places almost zero
load upon the measured circuit. Ideally, it places absolutely no load on the tested circuit, but
to achieve this ideal goal the null detector would have to have absolutely zero voltage across
it, which would require an inﬁnitely sensitive null meter and a perfect balance of voltage from
the adjustable voltage source. However, despite its practical inability to achieve absolute zero
loading, a potentiometric circuit is still an excellent technique for measuring voltage in high-
resistance circuits. And unlike the electronic ampliﬁer solution, which solves the problem with
advanced technology, the potentiometric method achieves a hypothetically perfect solution by
exploiting a fundamental law of electricity (KVL).
