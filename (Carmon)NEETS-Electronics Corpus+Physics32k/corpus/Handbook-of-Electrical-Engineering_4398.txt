After  the  deposition  is  complete,  the  reactant  ﬂow  is  stopped  except  for  a  small  ﬂow  of  oxygen,  and  the
temperature is raised by reducing the torch speed and increasing the ﬂows of oxygen and hydrogen through
the torch. Usually the exhaust end of the tube is closed ﬁrst and a small positive pressure is maintained inside
the  deposited  tube  while  the  torch  travels  backward.  The  higher  temperatures  cause  the  glass  viscosity  to
decrease, and the surface tension causes the tube to contract inward. The complete collapse of the tube into a
solid preform is achieved in several passes. The speed of the collapse, the rotation of the tube, the temperature
of collapse, and the positive pressure of oxygen inside the tube are all accurately controlled to predetermined
values in order to produce a straight and bubble-free preform with minimum ovality. The complete preform
is then taken off the lathe. After an inspection to assure that the preform is free of defects, the preform is ready
to be drawn into a thin ﬁber.
