 1. The current in
this circuit determined by Ohmâ€™s law is .5 amp. Each resistor develops (drops) 25 volts. The five tap-off
points indicated in the schematic are points at which the voltage can be measured. As indicated on the
schematic, the voltage measured at each of the points from point A to point E starts at zero volts and
becomes more positive in 25 volt steps to a value of positive 100 volts.
