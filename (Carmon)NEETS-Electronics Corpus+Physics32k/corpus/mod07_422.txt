To obtain a steady dc output, the capacitor must charge almost instantaneously to the value of 
applied voltage. Once charged, the capacitor must retain the charge as long as possible. The capacitor 
must have a short charge time constant (view A). This can be accomplished by keeping the internal 
resistance of the power supply as small as possible (fast charge time) and the resistance of the load as 
large as possible (for a slow discharge time as illustrated in view B).
