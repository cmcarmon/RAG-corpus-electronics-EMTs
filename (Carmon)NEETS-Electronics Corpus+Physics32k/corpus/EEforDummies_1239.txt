Set up the circuit and try it out! You can play the C‐major scale on it, and 
maybe even the beginning of a few tunes, such as “Do Re Mi” and “America 
the Beautiful.” Eventually, you’ll find that you need more notes, such as 
sharps and flats, or notes beyond one octave. Armed with your knowledge of 
the 555 timer IC, adding resistors in series, and opening and closing circuits 
with switches, you can build out this C‐major circuit to create more interest-
ing tunes.
