Using the paper dolls, lay out the printed circuit 
board in such a way that the paper dolls duplicate the 
schematic diagram. Exact component and lead place-
ment are not critical at this stage. Next, consider the 
trace placements (Figure 48-11B) for proper electrical 
connections. During the layout process, the printed cir-
cuit board will be viewed from the component side or 
top. Three issues address the best component placement:
  1.  Wasted board spaceâ€”Keep components in a hori-
