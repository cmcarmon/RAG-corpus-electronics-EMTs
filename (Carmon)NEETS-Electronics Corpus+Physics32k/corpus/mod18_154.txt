exist between the transmitted frequency and the reference frequency, which is used to detect the Doppler
shift of the receiver signal. Moving objects are detected by the phase difference between the target signal
and background noise components. Phase detection of this type relies on coherence between the
transmitter frequency and the receiver reference frequency.
