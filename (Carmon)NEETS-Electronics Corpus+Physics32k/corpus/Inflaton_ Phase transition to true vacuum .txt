Inflationary theory further postulates that this "inflationary" vacuum state is not the state with globally lowest energy – it's a false vacuum. This is also known as a metastable state. For each observer in any chosen point of space, false vacuum eventually tunnels into a state with the same potential energy, but which isn't a vacuum (it is not at a local minimum of the potential energy, it "can decay"). This state can be seen as a true vacuum, filled with a large number of inflaton particles. However, rate of expansion of the true vacuum does not change at this moment – only its exponential character changes to much slower expansion of FLRW metric. This ensures that expansion rate precisely matches the energy density.
