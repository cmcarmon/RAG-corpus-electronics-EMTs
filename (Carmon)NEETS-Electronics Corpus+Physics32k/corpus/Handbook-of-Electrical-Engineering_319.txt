(2) The angle, qo , is ﬁxed but the magnitude, * Zo
*, is allowed to vary. For example, the analyst may select
and ﬁx qo = 0(cid:176). This requires that the load be resistive (Z is entirely real). In this case, the value of the
load resistance should be selected to be equal to the magnitude of the Thévenin equivalent impedance
