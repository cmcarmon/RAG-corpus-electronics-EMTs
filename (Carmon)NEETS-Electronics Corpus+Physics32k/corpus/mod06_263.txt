Despite this precaution, the screen grid still draws some current from the electron stream. Any signal
applied to the control grid will appear at the screen grid inverted by 180ยบ from the input signal. This is
undesirable, as it reduces the gain of the tube. Consider the effect if the control grid goes positive.
Conduction through the tube increases, and since the screen grid is in the electron stream, it will draw
some current. This causes the screen grid to go toward negative potential (less positive). The effect then,
is to place a negative-going electrode between the plate and positive-going control grid. The plate
becomes partially screened by the negative-going screen grid, and again, gain will decrease. Because the
signal at the screen grid is always 180ยบ out of phase with the control grid, its effect will always be to
oppose the effect of the control grid.
