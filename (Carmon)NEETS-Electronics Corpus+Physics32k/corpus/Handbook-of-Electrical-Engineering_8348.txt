Built-in Self-Test (BIST) Techniques. The term built-in self-test (or BIST) is a generic name given to any
test technique in which an external test resource (e.g., component tester) is not needed to apply test patterns
and check a circuit’s response to those patterns. This implies that the test patterns must be preloaded into the
target device or be generated by the target device itself, in real time. For example, dedicating a section of an
IC component for implementing a ROM-based sequencer to apply prestored patterns to test another section
of that IC would be classiﬁed as a BIST technique. It is often more cost effective to generate the test patterns
in real time (i.e., during testing), but in general it is not possible to develop real-time test pattern generation
techniques  that  generate  arbitrarily  selected  test  patterns  without  additionally  generating  unnecessary  ones.
Note  that  whereas  storing  the  test  patterns  in  a  ROM  might  be  acceptable  in  some  cases,  the  size  of  ROM
necessary to store the test patterns prevents this technique being used for implementing BIST in large/complex
digital circuits.
