One use of phase splitters is to provide input signals to a single-stage amplifier that uses two 
transistors. These transistors are configured in such a way that the two outputs, 180ยบ out of phase with 
each other, combine. This allows more gain than one transistor could supply by itself. This "push-pull" 
amplifier is used where high power output and good fidelity are needed: receiver output stages, public 
address amplifiers, and AM modulators, for example.
