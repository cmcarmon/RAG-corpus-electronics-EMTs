A collision is an event in which two or more bodies exert forces on each other for a relatively short time. Although the most common colloquial use of the word "collision" refers to incidents in which two or more objects collide with great force, the scientific use of the word "collision" implies nothing about the magnitude of the force.
Some examples of physical interactions that scientists would consider collisions:
An insect touches its antenna to the leaf of a plant. The antenna is said to collide with leaf.
A cat walks through the grass. Each contact that its paws make with the ground is a collision. Each brush of its fur against a blade of grass is a collision.
When a boxer throws a punch, their fist is said to collide with the opponent's face.
