Figure  45-1  shows  a  decimal-to-binar y 
 encoder. Its function is to take a single digit (0 to 9) as 
input and to output a 4-bit code representation of the 
digit. This is referred to as a 10-line-to-4-line  encoder. 
That is, if the digit 4 on the keyboard is  entered, this 
produces a low output, or a 0, on line 4, which pro-
duces the 4-bit code 0100 as an output.
