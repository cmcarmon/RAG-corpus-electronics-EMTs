6.1.52 Figure P6.1.52 shows the master–slave JKFF. As-
suming that the output changes on the falling edge
of the clock pulse (i.e., when the clock pulse goes
from high to low), discuss the operation of the
ﬂip-ﬂop, and obtain a table indicating the state of
normal output Q after the passage of one clock
pulse for various combinations of the inputs JK.
6.2.1 A table for the direct 3-bit binary decoding is
given. Show a block diagram for a 3-to-8 decoder
and suggest a method for its implementation.
