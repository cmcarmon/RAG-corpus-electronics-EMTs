Figure 1-24(A) shows the initial reading of a circuit. The highest range (250 milliamperes) has been
selected and the meter indication is very small. It would be difficult to properly interpret this reading with
any degree of accuracy. Figure 1-24(B) shows the second reading, with the next largest range (50
milliamperes). The meter deflection is a little greater. It is possible to interpret this reading as 5
milliamperes. Since this approximation of the current is less than the next range, the meter is switched as
