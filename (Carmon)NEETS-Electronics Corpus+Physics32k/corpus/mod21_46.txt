Most Navy technical manuals provide voltage charts that list correct voltages at all primary test
points in a piece of equipment. Voltage measurements, when compared with these charts, provide a
valuable aid in locating troubles quickly and easily. However, if the sensitivity of the test equipment
differs from that of the test equipment used in preparing the chart, the voltage measurements may not
reflect true circuit conditions. You must keep in mind that a voltmeter with low sensitivity used on a low
range may disturb circuits under test or provide a false indication. Most technical manuals will tell you
what type and model of test equipment was used to prepare the voltage charts. As a rule of thumb, the
input impedance of the voltmeter should exceed the impedance of the circuit by a ratio of at least 10 to 1.
Technicians have spent uncounted hours of wasted time because they have selected improper test
equipment.
