One example of a typical electronic multimeter in use within the Navy is the electronic Model
8000A Digital Multimeter. Most electronic digital multimeters overcome the disadvantage of requiring a
continuous external power source by combining an external ac source with an internal rechargeable
battery. Another advantage of this meter is that it can be read directly and does not use a scale. Figure 4-8
shows the model 8000A multimeter.
