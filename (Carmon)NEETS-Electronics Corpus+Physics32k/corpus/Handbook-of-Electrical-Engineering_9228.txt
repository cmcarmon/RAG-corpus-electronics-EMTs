  of  software  defects.  The  severity  level  scheme  used  by
IBM,  and  widely  adopted  by  other  software  producers,  is  based  on  a  four-point  scale.  Severity  1  defects  are
those which stop the software completely or prevent it from being used at all. Severity 2 defects are those where
major functions are disabled or unusable. Severity 3 defects are those that can be bypassed or which have a
minor impact. Severity 4 defects are very minor problems which do not affect the operation of the software,
for example, a spelling error in a text message.
