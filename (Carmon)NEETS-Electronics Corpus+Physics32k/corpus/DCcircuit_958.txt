For some methods of solution (especially any method involving a calculator), it is helpful
to express each unknown term in each equation, with any constant value to the right of the
equal sign, and with any “unity” terms expressed with an explicit coefﬁcient of 1. Re-writing
the equations again, we have:
- 1I1 + 1I2 - 1I3 = 0
