Quality factor 
 
The  quality  of  a  resonant  (or  tuned)  circuit  is 
measured by its Q-factor. The higher the Q-factor, 
the  sharper  the  response  (narrower  bandwidth), 
conversely  the  lower  the  Q-factor,  the  flatter  the 
response  (wider  bandwidth),  see  Fig.  4.19.  In  the 
case  of  the  series  tuned  circuit,  the  Q-factor  will 
increase as the resistance, R, decreases. In the case
