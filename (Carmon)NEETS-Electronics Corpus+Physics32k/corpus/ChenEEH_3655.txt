The study of the abstract units and their relationships in a
language is called phonemics, while the study of the actual
sounds of the language is called phonetics. Moreover, each of
three branches of phonetics approaches the subject somewhat
differently. Articulatory phonetics is concerned with the
manner in which speech sounds are produced by the articula-
tors of the vocal system; acoustic phonetics research explores
the sounds of speech through analysis of acoustic waveforms;
and, auditory phonetics research focuses on perceptual re-
sponses to speech sounds as reï¬‚ected in listener trials. Our
cursory explorations into phonetics below will represent a
blend of articulatory and acoustic analysis.
