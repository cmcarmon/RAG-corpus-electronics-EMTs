In figure 1-2(A), the resistance in the circuit is 6 ohms. With the 6-volt battery shown, current in the
circuit is 1 ampere. In figure 1-2(B), the resistance has been changed to 12 ohms. With the 6-volt battery
shown, current in the circuit is 1/2 or .5 ampere. The magnetic field around the conductor in figure 1-2(B)
is weaker than the magnetic field around the conductor in figure 1-2(A). The compass needle in figure 1-
2(B) does not move as far from magnetic north.
