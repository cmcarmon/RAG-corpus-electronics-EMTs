The four-force




F



{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} }
as a function of three-force




f



{\displaystyle \mathbf {f} }
is given by




F

)

/

c
,


f


)



{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =\gamma \left((\mathbf {f} \cdot \mathbf {u} )/c,\ \mathbf {f} \right)}
. Four-force and four-acceleration (2) and the invariant mass



m


{\displaystyle m}
are furthermore related by




F

m

{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =m\mathbf {A} }
, thus

{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =\left(\gamma {\frac {\mathbf {f} \cdot \mathbf {u} }{c}},\ \gamma \mathbf {f} \right)=m\mathbf {A} =m\left(\gamma ^{4}\left({\frac {\mathbf {u} \cdot \mathbf {a} }{c}}\right),\ \gamma ^{4}\left({\frac {\mathbf {u} \cdot \mathbf {a} }{c^{2}}}\right)\mathbf {u} +\gamma ^{2}\mathbf {a} \right)}
.
The relation between three-force and three-acceleration for arbitrary directions of the velocity is thus

When the velocity is directed in the x-direction by



u
=

u

x




{\displaystyle u=u_{x}}
and only accelerations parallel (x-direction) or perpendicular (y-, z-direction) to the velocity are considered

Therefore, the Newtonian definition of mass as the ratio of three-force and three-acceleration is disadvantageous in SR, because such a mass would depend both on velocity and direction. Consequently, the following mass definitions used in older textbooks are not used anymore:





m

f

{\displaystyle m_{\Vert }={\frac {f_{x}}{a_{x}}}=m\gamma ^{3}}
as "longitudinal mass",

{\displaystyle m_{\perp }={\frac {f_{y}}{a_{y}}}={\frac {f_{z}}{a_{z}}}=m\gamma }
as "transverse mass".
The relation (5a) between three-acceleration and three-force can also be obtained from the equation of motion

where




p



{\displaystyle \mathbf {p} }
is the three-momentum. The corresponding transformation of three-force between




f



{\displaystyle \mathbf {f} }
in



S


{\displaystyle S}
and





f

′



{\displaystyle \mathbf {f} '}
in




S

{\displaystyle S'}
(when the relative velocity between the frames is directed in the x-direction by



v
=

v

x




{\displaystyle v=v_{x}}
and only accelerations parallel (x-direction) or perpendicular (y-, z-direction) to the velocity are considered) follows by substitution of the relevant transformation formulas for
