The Schering bridge, shown in figure 3-1, is a commonly used type of bridge for the measurement of 
capacitors and dielectric losses. The Q of a capacitor is defined as the reciprocal of the dissipation factor, 
which is the ratio of the capacitor's dielectric constant to its conductivity at a given frequency. 
Accordingly, capacitor Q is determined by the frequency used to conduct the measurement and the value 
of the capacitor, CB, required to obtain bridge balance. The accuracy of this type of bridge is excellent, 
about 2% for dissipation factors ranging from 0.00002 to 0.6. Typical accuracies for capacitive reactances 
in the range of 100 picofarads to 1 microfarad are 0.2%.
