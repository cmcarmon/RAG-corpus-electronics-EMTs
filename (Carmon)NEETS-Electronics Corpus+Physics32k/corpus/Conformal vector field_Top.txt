A conformal vector field (often conformal Killing vector field and occasionally conformal or conformal collineation) of a Riemannian manifold



(
M
,
g
)


{\displaystyle (M,g)}
is a vector field



X


{\displaystyle X}
that satisfies:







L



X


g
=
φ
g


{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{X}g=\varphi g}

for some smooth real-valued function



φ


{\displaystyle \varphi }
on



M


{\displaystyle M}
, where






L



X


g


{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{X}g}
denotes the Lie derivative of the metric



g


{\displaystyle g}
with respect to



X


{\displaystyle X}
. In the case that



φ


{\displaystyle \varphi }
is identically zero,



X


{\displaystyle X}
is called a Killing vector field.
