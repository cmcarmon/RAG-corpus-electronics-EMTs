Generation control and ED minimize the current cost of energy production and transmission within the range
of available controls. Energy management is a supervisory layer responsible for economically scheduling pro-
duction  and  transmission  on  a  global  basis  and  over  time  intervals  consistent  with  cost  optimization.  For
example, water stored in reservoirs of hydro plants is a resource that may be more valuable in the future and
should,  therefore,  not  be  used  now  even  though  the  cost  of  hydro  energy  is  currently  lower  than  thermal
generation. The global consideration arises from the ability to buy and sell energy through the interconnected
power system; it may be more economical to buy than to produce from plants under direct control. Energy
accounting processes transaction information and energy measurements recorded during actual operation as
the basis of payment for energy sales and purchases.
