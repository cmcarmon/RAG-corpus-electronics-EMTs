Resistance, by deﬁnition, is the measure of friction a component presents to the ﬂow of
electrons through it. Resistance is symbolized by the capital letter ”R” and is measured in the
unit of ”ohm.” However, we can also think of this electrical property in terms of its inverse:
how easy it is for electrons to ﬂow through a component, rather than how difﬁcult. If resistance
is the word we use to symbolize the measure of how difﬁcult it is for electrons to ﬂow, then a
good word to express how easy it is for electrons to ﬂow would be conductance.
