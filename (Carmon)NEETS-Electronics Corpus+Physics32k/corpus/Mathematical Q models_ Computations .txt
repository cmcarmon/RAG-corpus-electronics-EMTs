For each of the Q models Ursin B. and Toverud T. presented in their article they computed the attenuation (1.5) and phase velocity (1.6) in the frequency band 0–300 Hz. Fig.1. presents the graph for the Kolsky model – attenuation (left) and phase velocity (right) with cr = 2000 m/s, Qr = 100 and wr = 2π100 Hz.
