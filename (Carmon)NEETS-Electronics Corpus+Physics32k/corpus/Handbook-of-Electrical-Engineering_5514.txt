Shunt Capacitors
Shunt capacitors are used to supply capacitive kVAR to the system at the point where they are connected, with
the same effect as an overexcited synchronous condenser, generator, or motor. Shunt capacitors supply reactive
power  to  counteract  the  out-of-phase  component  of  current  required  by  an  inductive  load.  They  are  either
energized continuously or switched on and off during load cycles.
