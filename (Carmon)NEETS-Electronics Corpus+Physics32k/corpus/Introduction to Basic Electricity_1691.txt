A series‑parallel circuit is a combination of a series 
and a parallel circuit. Figure 13‑24 shows a simple 
 series‑parallel circuit with resistors. Notice that R2 and 
R3 are in parallel and that this parallel  combination 
is in series with R1 and R4. The current flows from 
the  negative  side  of  the  voltage  source  through 
 resistor R4 and divides at point A to flow through 
the two branches, R2 and R3. At point B, the current 
 recombines and flows through R1.
