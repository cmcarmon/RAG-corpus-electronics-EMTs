The value of Infrastructure as Code can be broken down into three, measurable categories: Cost (reduction), Speed (faster execution) and Risk (remove errors and security violations). Cost reduction aims at helping not only the enterprise financially but also in terms of people and effort, meaning that by removing the manual component, people are able to refocus their efforts towards other enterprise tasks. Infrastructure automation enables speed through faster execution when configuring your infrastructure and aims at providing visibility to help other teams across the enterprise work quickly and more efficiently. Automation removes the risk associated with human error, like manual misconfiguration; removing this can decrease downtime and increase reliability. These outcomes and attributes help the enterprise move towards implementing a culture of DevOps, the combined working of Development and Operations.
