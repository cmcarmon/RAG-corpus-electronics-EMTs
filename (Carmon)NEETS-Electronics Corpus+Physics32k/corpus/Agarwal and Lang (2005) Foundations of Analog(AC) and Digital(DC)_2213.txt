At time t = t1, the switch moves to position (1), and C1 charges (instantly) to voltage
v1(t1). Then at time t2, the switch moves to position (2), and C1 discharges into C2.

Assuming that the usual Op Amp approximation of (v
calculate the charge that is ‘‘dumped’’ at each cycle, hence the average current (a function
of both vI and the switching frequency fc), and hence the effective resistance of the
switched capacitor. Also, show that the overall system equation relating vO to vI is the
same as in Problem 5.14.

In Figure 15.83, what are the constraints on C1 and C2 set by
the Op Amp voltage and current limits? Calculate the appropriate values of C1, C2, and
fc for operation at 20 Hz and above. Can the circuit now be built on an IC chip if we
replace the switch by MOS transistors, and Cmax = 100 pF?
