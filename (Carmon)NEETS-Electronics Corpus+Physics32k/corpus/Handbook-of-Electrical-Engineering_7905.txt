bus in a microprocessor or other bus-based system and that is used to describe the microprocessor. The Z80,
for instance, is said to be an eight-bit processor, indicating that the working registers are eight bits wide. The
bit values in the register may represent a numerical value in standard ﬁxed point binary, ﬂoating point, or some
other coded form. Alternatively, they may indicate some logical pattern such as the settings of switches used
in an industrial controller.
