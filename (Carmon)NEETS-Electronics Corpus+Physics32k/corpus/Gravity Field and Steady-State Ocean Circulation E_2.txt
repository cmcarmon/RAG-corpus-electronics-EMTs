The final gravity map and model of the geoid will provide users worldwide with well-defined data product that will lead to:
A better understanding of the physics of the Earth's interior to gain new insights into the geodynamics associated with the lithosphere, mantle composition and rheology, uplift and subduction processes.
A better understanding of the ocean currents and heat transport.
A global height-reference system, which can serve as a reference surface for the study of topographic processes and sea-level change.
Better estimates of the thickness of polar ice-sheets and their movement.
