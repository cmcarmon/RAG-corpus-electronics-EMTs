An example of refraction is the apparent bending of a spoon when it is immersed in a cup of water.
The bending seems to take place at the surface of the water, or exactly at the point where there is a change
of density. Obviously, the spoon does not bend from the pressure of the water. The light forming the
image of the spoon is bent as it passes from the water (a medium of high density) to the air (a medium of
comparatively low density).
