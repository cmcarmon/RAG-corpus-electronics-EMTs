Newton's Second Law of Motion can be expressed mathematically,





F

=
m

a

,


{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =m\mathbf {a} ,}

or force = mass × acceleration. The rotational equivalent for point particles is





τ

=
I

α

+
2
r

p

ω

,


{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}=I{\boldsymbol {\alpha }}+2rp_{||}{\boldsymbol {\omega }},}

Because angular acceleration is the time derivative of angular velocity, and because the moment of inertia is



m

r

2




{\displaystyle mr^{2}}
for point particles, the above formula is equivalent to




τ

=
I



d

d

d

d

ω

.


{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}=I{\frac {d{\boldsymbol {\omega }}}{dt}}+{\frac {d{I}}{dt}}{\boldsymbol {\omega }}.}
Rearranging into a form suitable for integration,




τ

=



d
(
I

ω

)


d
t





{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}={\frac {d(I{\boldsymbol {\omega }})}{dt}}}
and




τ

d
t
=
d
(
I

ω

)
,


{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}dt=d(I{\boldsymbol {\omega }}),}
and integrating with respect to time,




∫

τ

d
t
=
I

ω

+

constant

.


{\displaystyle \int {\boldsymbol {\tau }}dt=I{\boldsymbol {\omega }}+{\text{constant}}.}

Therefore, a torque acting over time is equivalent to a change in angular momentum, known as angular impulse, by analogy with impulse, which is defined as the change in translational momentum. The constant can be interpreted as the initial angular momentum of the body, before the torque began to act. In particular, if torque




τ

=

0

,


{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}=\mathbf {0} ,}
then angular momentum




L

=

0

+

constant

.


{\displaystyle \mathbf {L} =\mathbf {0} +{\text{constant}}.}
That is, if no torque acts upon a body, then its angular momentum remains constant. Conversely,





L

=
I

ω



{\displaystyle \mathbf {L} =I{\boldsymbol {\omega }}}

or Angular momentum = moment of inertia × angular velocity, and its time derivative is







d

L



d
t



=

I



d

ω



d

.


{\displaystyle {\frac {d\mathbf {L} }{dt}}={\frac {dI}{dt}}{\boldsymbol {\omega }}+I{\frac {d{\boldsymbol {\omega }}}{dt}}.}

Because the moment of inertia is



m

r

2




{\displaystyle mr^{2}}
, it follows that






d
I


d
t



=
2
r

p

{\displaystyle {\frac {dI}{dt}}=2rp_{||}}
, and






d

I



d

+

r

p


|

ω

,


{\displaystyle {\frac {d\mathbf {L} }{dt}}=I{\frac {d{\boldsymbol {\omega }}}{dt}}+2rp_{||}{\boldsymbol {\omega }},}
which, as above, reduces to







d

d

I

α

r

ω

.


{\displaystyle {\frac {d\mathbf {L} }{dt}}=I{\boldsymbol {\alpha }}+2rp_{||}{\boldsymbol {\omega }}.}

Therefore, the time rate of change of angular momentum about a particular center of rotation is equivalent to applied torque about that center. If angular momentum is constant,






d

d
t



=
0


{\displaystyle {\frac {d\mathbf {L} }{dt}}=0}
and no torque is applied.
