An important caveat to Ohmâ€™s Law is that all quantities (voltage, current, resistance, and
power) must relate to each other in terms of the same two points in a circuit. For instance, with
a single-battery, single-resistor circuit, we could easily calculate any quantity because they all
applied to the same two points in the circuit:
