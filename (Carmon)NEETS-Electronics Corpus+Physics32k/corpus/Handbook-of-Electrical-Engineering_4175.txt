The Diendorfer–Uman (DU) Model and a Modiﬁcation of It
The  DU  model  [Diendorfer  and  Uman,  1990]  is  a  physically  reasonable  model  that  can  predict  the  salient
features of the measured lightning electric and magnetic ﬁelds. Given the return stroke current at ground level,
the channel current above ground is assumed to discharge the leader by way of two independent processes: (1)
the discharge of the highly ionized core of the leader channel, termed the breakdown discharge process, with
a time constant of 1 ms or less, and (2) the discharge of the corona envelope with a larger time constant. In
both cases, the discharge at a height z¢ starts when the return stroke front, assumed to travel up at a constant
speed v, arrives at z¢. The liberated currents are assumed to ﬂow to the ground at the speed of light.
