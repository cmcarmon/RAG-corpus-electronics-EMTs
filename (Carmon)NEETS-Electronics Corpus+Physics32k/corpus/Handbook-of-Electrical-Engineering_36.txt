Power Rating and Derating Curves
Resistors must be operated within speciﬁed temperature limits to avoid permanent damage to the materials.
The temperature limit is deﬁned in terms of the maximum power, called the power rating, and derating curve.
The power rating of a resistor is the maximum power in watts which the resistor can dissipate. The maximum
power rating is a function of resistor material, maximum voltage rating, resistor dimensions, and maximum
allowable hot-spot temperature. The maximum hot-spot temperature is the temperature of the hottest part on
the resistor when dissipating full-rated power at rated ambient temperature.
