Strategic factors should be incorporated in the overall economic justiﬁcation process, but they are difﬁcult
to  access  and  incorporate  due  to  their  inherent  complexity. Verk  [1990]  proposes  a  general  framework  that
attempts to integrate both qualitative and quantitative factors in an economic justiﬁcation process. The approach
taken is being tested at Cincinnati Milacron and the Mazak Corporation.
