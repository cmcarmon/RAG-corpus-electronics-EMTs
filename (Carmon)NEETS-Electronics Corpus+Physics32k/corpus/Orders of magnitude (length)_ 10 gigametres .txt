To help compare different distances this section lists lengths starting at 1010 metres (10 gigametres (Gm) or 10 million kilometres, or 0.07 Astronomical units).
15 Gm – Closest distance of Comet Hyakutake from Earth
18 Gm – One light-minute (see yellow sphere in right-hand diagram)
24 Gm – Radius of a heliostationary orbit
46 Gm – Perihelion distance of Mercury (yellow ellipse on the right)
55 Gm – 60,000-year perigee of Mars (last achieved on 27 August 2003)
55 Gm - Radius of Rigel, a blue supergiant star (largest star on right)
58 Gm – Average passing distance between Earth and Mars at the moment they overtake each other in their orbits
61 Gm – Diameter of Aldebaran, an orange giant star (large star on right)
70 Gm – Aphelion distance of Mercury
76 Gm – Neso's apocentric distance; greatest distance of a natural satellite from its parent planet (Neptune)
