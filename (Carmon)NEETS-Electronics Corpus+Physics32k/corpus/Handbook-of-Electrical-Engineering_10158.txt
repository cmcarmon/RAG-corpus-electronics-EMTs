Adaptive Control
In  an  attempt  to  reduce  the  errors  caused  by  the  mis-
match of the model with the real system, several adaptive
control schemes have been investigated. Model reference
adaptive  control  (MRAC)  is  one  such  approach.
Dubowsky  and  DesForges  [1979]  were  the  ﬁrst  to  use
this  method  for  manipulator  control.  This  method  is
illustrated in Fig. 101.18. They have chosen a linear sec-
ond-order  system  with  desired z  and wn  as  a  reference
model for each joint. Their scheme works as long as the
manipulator changes conﬁguration slowly relative to the
adaptation  rate.  Since  then  several  researchers  have
extended the concepts well developed for linear systems
to manipulator control. Two aspects that are central to
all these methods are identiﬁcation of the plant or its parameters and use of this new information to update
the control law. An extensive review of recent work in this area is given by Craig [1988] and Hsia [1986]. In
spite of many approaches suggested for this problem, no attempt has been made to implement these methods
by the robot industry.
