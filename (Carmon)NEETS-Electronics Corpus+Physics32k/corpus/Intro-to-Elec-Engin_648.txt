The maximum and minimum values of vt are (VB + √
2 VS ),
corresponding to the values of sin ωt equal to +1 and −1, respectively. The small-
signal current and voltage waveforms, for values of VS much less than VB, are shown
in Figure E7.2.5(f). The large-signal current and voltage waveforms, for values of VS
comparable to those of VB, are shown in Figure E7.2.5(g).
