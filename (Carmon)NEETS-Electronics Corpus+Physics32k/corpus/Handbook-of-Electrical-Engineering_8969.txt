The second form of pen-based input device is one that uses electromagnetic technology and consists of a
grid of wires that transmit radio waves that are picked up by a tuned circuit in the stylus. This circuit resonates
at its own frequency and transmits that signal back to the wires at the grid location it is touching. The pen also
transmits its signal to the computer, which turns off the grid transmission, and locates the position of the pen
by determining which of the grid wires pick up the pen signal. The pen does not need to actually touch the
display surface and does not require any power, which is an advantage somewhat counteracted by the higher cost.
Finally,  the  Scriptel  unit  is  similar  to  that  made  by  Microtouch,  but  differs  in  that  it  uses  electrostatic
