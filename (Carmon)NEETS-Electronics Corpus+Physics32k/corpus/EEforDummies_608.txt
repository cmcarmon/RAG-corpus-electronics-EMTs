Recognizing a transistor when you see one
The semiconductor material in a transistor is the size of a grain of sand or 
even smaller, so manufacturers put these teensy components in a metal or 
plastic case with leads sticking out so you can connect them in your circuits. 
You can find literally dozens upon dozens of different shapes and sizes of 
transistors, some of which are shown in Figure 10-4.
