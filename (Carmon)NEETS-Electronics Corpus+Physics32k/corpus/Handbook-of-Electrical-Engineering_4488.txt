knowledge  may  provide  engineers  with  a  complementary  methodology  to  assist  in  the  creativity  that  is  the
essence of design (see Lowther, 1996). An example of a Ô¨Ånite element solution displayed on a modern work-
 electro-
station for a three-dimensional eddy current problem with a moving conductor retarded by a 
magnet is shown in Fig. 44.5. The post-processor indicates the magnitude and direction of the induced eddy
