Materials that need electrons to complete their 
 valence shell are not stable and are referred to as  active 
materials. To gain stability, an active material must 
 acquire electrons in its valence shell. Silicon atoms are 
able to share their valence electrons with other sili-
con  atoms in a process called covalent  bonding 
 (Figure 28-3). Covalent bonding is the process of sharing 
valence electrons, resulting in the formation of crystals.
Each atom in such a crystalline structure has four 
of its own electrons and four shared electrons from 
four other atoms—a total of eight valence electrons. 
This covalent bond cannot support electrical activity 
because of its stability.
