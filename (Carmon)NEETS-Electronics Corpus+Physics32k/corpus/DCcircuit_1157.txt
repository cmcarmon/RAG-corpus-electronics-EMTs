Another measure of cross-sectional wire area is the gauge. The gauge scale is based on
whole numbers rather than fractional or decimal inches. The larger the gauge number, the
skinnier the wire; the smaller the gauge number, the fatter the wire. For those acquainted
with shotguns, this inversely-proportional measurement scale should sound familiar.
