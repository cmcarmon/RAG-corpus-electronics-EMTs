Some electrical and electronic devices have meters built into them. These meters are known as in-
circuit meters. An in-circuit meter is used to monitor the operation of the device in which it is installed.
Some examples of in-circuit meters are the generator or alternator meter on some automobiles; the
voltage, current, and frequency meters on control panels at electrical power plants; and the electrical
power meter that records the amount of electricity used in a building.
