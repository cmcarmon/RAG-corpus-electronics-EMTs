Maxwell's equations describe the behaviour of electromagnetic fields; electric field, electric displacement field, and the magnetic field. The differential forms of these equations require that there is always an open neighbourhood around the point to which they are applied, otherwise the vector fields E, D, B and H are not differentiable. In other words, the medium must be continuous. On the interface of two different media with different values for electrical permittivity and magnetic permeability, that condition does not apply.
However the interface conditions for the electromagnetic field vectors can be derived from the integral forms of Maxwell's equations.
