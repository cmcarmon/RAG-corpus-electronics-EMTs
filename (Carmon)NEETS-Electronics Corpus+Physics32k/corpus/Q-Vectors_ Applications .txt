Q-vectors can be determined wholly with: geopotential height (



Φ


{\displaystyle \Phi }
) and temperature on a constant pressure surface. Q-vectors always point in the direction of ascending air. For an idealized cyclone and anticyclone in the Northern Hemisphere (where

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial T}{\partial y}}<0}
), cyclones have Q-vectors which point parallel to the thermal wind and anticyclones have Q-vectors that point antiparallel to the thermal wind. This means upward motion in the area of warm air advection and downward motion in the area of cold air advection.
In frontogenesis, temperature gradients need to tighten for initiation. For those situations Q-vectors point toward ascending air and the tightening thermal gradients. In areas of convergent Q-vectors, cyclonic vorticity is created, and in divergent areas, anticyclonic vorticity is created.
