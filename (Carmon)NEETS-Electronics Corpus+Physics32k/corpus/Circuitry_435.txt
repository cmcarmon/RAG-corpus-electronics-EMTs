Positive feedback 
 
In  Chapter  7,  we  showed  how  negative  feedback 
can be applied to an amplifier to form the basis of a 
stage  which  has  a  precisely  controlled  gain.  An 
alternative  form  of  feedback,  where  the  output  is 
fed  back  in  such  a  way  as  to  reinforce  the  input 
(rather  than  to  subtract  from  it),  is  known  as 
positive feedback.  
  Figure  9.1  shows  the  block  diagram  of  an 
amplifier  stage  with  positive  feedback  applied. 
Note  that  the  amplifier  provides  a  phase  shift  of 
180°  and  the  feedback  network  provides  a  further 
180°. Thus the overall phase shift is 0°. The overall 
voltage gain, G, is given by:
