e) Determine the small-signal output resistance of the amplifier. That is, determine the
equivalent resistance of the amplifier at the output port of its small-signal model
with vi ≡ 0. Is the small-signal output resistance greater than, less than, or equal to
that of the ‘‘common source’’ amplifier shown in Figure 8.50?
