In the analysis of a flow, it is often desirable to reduce the number of equations or the number of variables being dealt with, or both. The incompressible Navier-Stokes equation with mass continuity (four equations in four unknowns) can, in fact, be reduced to a single equation with a single dependent variable in 2D, or one vector equation in 3D. This is enabled by two vector calculus identities:




∇
×
(
∇
ϕ
)
=
0


{\displaystyle \nabla \times (\nabla \phi )=0}





∇
⋅
(
∇

A

)
=
0


{\displaystyle \nabla \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf {A} )=0}

for any differentiable scalar



ϕ


{\displaystyle \phi }
and vector




A



{\displaystyle \mathbf {A} }
. The first identity implies that any term in the Navier-Stokes equation that may be represented as the gradient of a scalar will disappear when the curl of the equation is taken. Commonly, pressure p and external acceleration g are what eliminate, resulting in (this is true in 2D as well as 3D):

u

{\displaystyle \nabla \times \left({\frac {\partial \mathbf {u} }{\partial t}}+\mathbf {u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf {u} \right)=\nu \nabla \times (\nabla ^{2}\mathbf {u} )}

where it's assumed that all body forces are describable as gradients (for example it is true for gravity), and density has been divided so that viscosity becomes kinematic viscosity.
The second vector calculus identity above states that the divergence of the curl of a vector field is zero. Since the (incompressible) mass continuity equation specifies the divergence of flow velocity being zero, we can replace the flow velocity with the curl of some vector






ψ
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {\psi }}}
so that mass continuity is always satisfied:

u

⇒

=
0


{\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} =0\quad \Rightarrow \quad \nabla \cdot (\nabla \times {\vec {\psi }})=0\quad \Rightarrow \quad 0=0}

So, as long as flow velocity is represented through




u

=
∇
×



ψ
→





{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} =\nabla \times {\vec {\psi }}}
, mass continuity is unconditionally satisfied. With this new dependent vector variable, the Navier-Stokes equation (with curl taken as above) becomes a single fourth order vector equation, no longer containing the unknown pressure variable and no longer dependent on a separate mass continuity equation:

{\displaystyle \nabla \times \left({\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}(\nabla \times {\vec {\psi }})+(\nabla \times {\vec {\psi }})\cdot \nabla (\nabla \times {\vec {\psi }})\right)=\nu \nabla \times (\nabla ^{2}(\nabla \times {\vec {\psi }}))}

Apart from containing fourth order derivatives, this equation is fairly complicated, and is thus uncommon. Note that if the cross differentiation is left out, the result is a third order vector equation containing an unknown vector field (the gradient of pressure) that may be determined from the same boundary conditions that one would apply to the fourth order equation above.
