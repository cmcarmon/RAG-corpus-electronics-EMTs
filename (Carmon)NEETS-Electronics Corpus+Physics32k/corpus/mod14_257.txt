When broken down, the two functions performed by the NOR gate can be represented by the
equivalent circuit depicted in figure 2-15. When both inputs to the OR gate are LOW, the output is LOW.
A LOW applied to an inverter gives a HIGH output. If either or both of the inputs to the OR gate are
HIGH, the output will be HIGH. When this HIGH output is applied to the inverter, the resulting output is
LOW. The Boolean expression for the output of this NOR gate is f = K L+ . The expression is spoken,
"K OR L quantity NOT."
