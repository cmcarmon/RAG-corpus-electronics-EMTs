To get the mathematical demonstration read: Self-buckling
A free-standing, vertical column, with density



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
, Young's modulus



E


{\displaystyle E}
, and cross-sectional area



A


{\displaystyle A}
, will buckle under its own weight if its height exceeds a certain critical value:

{\displaystyle h_{crit}=\left({\frac {9B^{2}}{4}}\,{\frac {EI}{\rho gA}}\right)^{\frac {1}{3}}}

where g is the acceleration due to gravity, I is the second moment of area of the beam cross section, and B is the first zero of the Bessel function of the first kind of order -1/3, which is equal to 1.86635086…
