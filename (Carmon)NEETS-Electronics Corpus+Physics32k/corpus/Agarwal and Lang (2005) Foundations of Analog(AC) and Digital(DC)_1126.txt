Now, let us examine the last procedure more closely. Notice that in Step 2
it is actually necessary to linearize only the constitutive laws that describe the
behavior of the individual circuit components because KVL and KCL are already
linear equations. It is for this reason that the first procedure called for the
linearization of only the constitutive laws. Further, because KVL and KCL con-
stitute a linear set of equations, they are unchanged by the linearization step.
This is important to recognize because KVL and KCL contain the informa-
tion concerning the topology of the original circuit. That is, they state which
branches are connected to which nodes, and which branches connect to form
which loops. Since KVL and KCL are unaffected by the linearization step,
the topological information is preserved during linearization. It is for this rea-
son that the small-signal circuit model has the same topology as the original
circuit. Thus, the linearized set of equations describing the behavior of the
small-signal circuit variables that is generated by the more formal mathemati-
cal procedure comprises the original KVL and KCL equations, and linearized
component constitutive laws. Thus, to develop a small-signal circuit model
it is necessary to determine only equivalent linearized circuit components and
substitute them into the circuit in place of their corresponding original circuit
components.
