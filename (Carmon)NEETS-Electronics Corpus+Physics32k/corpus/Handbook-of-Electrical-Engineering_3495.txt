In evaluating the thermal resistance by this relation, care must be taken to determine the effective cross-sectional
area  for  heat  ï¬‚ow  at  each  layer  in  the  module.  For  single-chip  modules,  the  requisite  areas  can  be  readily
obtained, although care must be taken to consider possible voidage in solder and adhesive layers.
