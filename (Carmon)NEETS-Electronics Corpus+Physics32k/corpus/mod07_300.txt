In general, varactors are used to replace the old style variable capacitor tuning. They are used in 
tuning circuits of more sophisticated communication equipment and in other circuits where variable 
capacitance is required. One advantage of the varactor is that it allows a dc voltage to be used to tune a 
circuit for simple remote control or automatic tuning functions. One such application of the varactor is as 
a variable tuning capacitor in a receiver or transmitter tank circuit like that shown in figure 3-16.
