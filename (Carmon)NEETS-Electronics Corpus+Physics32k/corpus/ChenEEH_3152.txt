Porcelain and glass insulators have been used for more than
100 years. The widespread use of composite insulators began in
North America during the 1970s. Figure 5.2 shows a schematic
of these insulators for use on outdoor lines (Gorur et al., 1999).
The most widely used type of porcelain and glass insulator,
worldwide, is the cap and pin insulator where each unit or bell
is connected to each other by metal hardware. The number of
bells is dependent on the voltage class. In Europe, the use of
porcelain long-rod insulators, where intermediate metal elec-
trodes are signiﬁcantly reduced or eliminated, is equally popu-
lar. In comparison, composite insulators have a single piece of
dielectric, which is the ﬁberglass rod that is covered by a
polymer housing and is attached to the metal terminals.
