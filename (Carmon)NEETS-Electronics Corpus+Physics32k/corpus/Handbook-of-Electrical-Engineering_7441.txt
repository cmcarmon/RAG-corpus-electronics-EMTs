A carefully developed simulation is much like having a breadboard implementation of the communication system
available for study. Experiments can be performed using the simulation much like experiments can be performed
using hardware. System parameters can be easily changed, and the impact of these changes can be evaluated. By
continuing this process, parameteric studies can easily be conducted and acceptable, or perhaps even optimum,
parameter values can be determined. By changing parameters, or even the system topology, one can play “what if”
games much more quickly and economically using a simulation than with a system realized in hardware.
