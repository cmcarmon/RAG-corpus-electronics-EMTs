This result states that the sum of the complex power delivered to all branches of a linear circuit operating
in the ac steady state is zero. Alternatively stated, the total complex power delivered to a network by its sources
equals the sum of the complex power delivered to its nonsource branches. Again, this result is not surprising.
Since, if a complex quantity is zero, both the real and imaginary parts must be zero, the same result can be
stated for the average power and for the reactive power.
