The constellation consists of 7 satellites. Three of the seven satellites are located in geostationary orbit (GEO) at 32.5° East, 83° East, and 131.5° East longitude, approximately 36,000 km (22,000 mi) above earth surface. Remaining four satellites are in inclined geosynchronous orbit (GSO). Two of them cross equator at 55° East and two at 111.75° East. The four GSO satellites will appear to be moving in the form of an "8".
