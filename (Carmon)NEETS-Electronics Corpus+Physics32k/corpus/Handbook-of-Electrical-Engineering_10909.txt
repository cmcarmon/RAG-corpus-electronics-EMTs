The Editing of Block-Diagram Symbols
In  BEACON,  all  symbols  were  developed  using  a  Symbol  Editor  as  shown  in  Figs.  112.14  and  112.15.  This
graphical editor is similar to most other object-oriented graphical editors, with the additional ability to describe
diagram connectivity and the display of changing parameter values on the symbol itself. Each symbol is made
up of a variety of separate objects (shapes) that are grouped together.
