Gain Reduction
Many linear control systems can be made sufﬁciently stable merely by reduction of the open-loop system gain
to a sufﬁciently low value. This approach ignores all performance speciﬁcations, however, except that of phase
margin (PM) and is, therefore, usually not a satisfactory approach. It is a very simple one, however, and serves
to illustrate the approach to be taken in more complex cases.
