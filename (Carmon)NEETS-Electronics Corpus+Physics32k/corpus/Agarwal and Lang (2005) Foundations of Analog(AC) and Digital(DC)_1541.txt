b) Referring to Figure 10.94c, assume that the input to the buffer vA undergoes a step
transition from 0 V to VS at time t = 0. Write an expression for vC(t) for t ≥ 0
for the step transition in vA. (Hint: Refer to the sketch of vB drawn in part (a.) The
MOSFET in INV2 stays on for vB ≥ VT, and turns off when vB < VT.) Sketch the
form of vC(t) for t ≥ 0.
