transistor in the supply voltage (Vdd) or the ground (Gnd)
path as in. The extra transistor is turned on in the used section
and off in the unused section gated. It maintains the perform-
ance and advantages of low-power supply and threshold volt-
ages while reducing leakage and leakage energy dissipation.
The fundamental reason for the reduction in leakage is the
stacking effect of self-reverse-bias series-connected transistors.
However, the transistor impacts the switching speed due to a
nonzero voltage drop across the gated-Vdd transistor between
the supply rails and the ‘‘virtual Gnd’’ for NMOS gated Vdd
(Figure 7.11) or the ‘‘virtual Vdd’’ for PMOS gated-Vdd.
