Specimens reveal that Petrolacosaurus had a slightly elongated skull with two temporal fenestrae. The upper temporal fenestra is located posteriorly to an enlarged orbit. This is a distinctly diapsid character.
On the dentary, there are marginal teeth, displaying a primitive type of shallow implantation. There are also two larger teeth on the premaxilla, the function of which will be explained below in more detail. The palatal arrangement bears close resemblance to Youngoides.
