One might be tempted to write node equations for the junctions labeled
5 and 6, but this doesnâ€™t make much sense. The branch between 4 and 6 is
a perfect conductor, hence it is really just part of the copper lead attached to
resistor R4. For this reason we did not bother defining a separate current variable
for this branch. A similar argument applies to branch 4-5.
