The compatibility of planar antennas with various types of
printed circuit transmission lines allows the possibility of active
circuitry and antenna being fabricated on a single printed
circuit board, which allows for several attractive possibilities.
First, minimizing losses between the antenna and receiver will
increase sensitivity with no additional engineering of the re-
ceiver. In transmit mode systems, placing the power ampliﬁer
directly at the antenna minimizes output losses to realize high-
efﬁciency performance by eliminating interconnects. This is
possible if proper matching can be maintained. This approach
