The peak power ratings of magnetrons range from a few thousand watts (kilowatts) to several million
watts (megawatts). The average power ratings are much lower, however, and vary from a few watts to
several kilowatts. Additionally, many of the magnetrons used in modern radar systems are tunable in
frequency. Typically, a tunable magnetron can vary the output frequency â€“ 5 percent about the center of
its frequency band. Thus the carrier frequency of radar can be changed to obtain the best operation or
avoid electronic jamming on a particular frequency.
