In figure 1-24 view A, the conductor is moving TOWARD the front of the page and the electrons
move from left to right. The movement of the electrons occurs because of the magnetically induced emf
acting on the electrons in the copper. The right-hand end becomes negative, and the left-hand end
positive. The conductor is stopped at view B, motion is eliminated (one of the three required conditions),
and there is no longer an induced emf. Consequently, there is no longer any difference in potential
between the two ends of the wire. The conductor at view C is moving away from the front of the page. An
induced emf is again created. However, note carefully that the REVERSAL OF MOTION has caused a
REVERSAL OF DIRECTION in the induced emf.
