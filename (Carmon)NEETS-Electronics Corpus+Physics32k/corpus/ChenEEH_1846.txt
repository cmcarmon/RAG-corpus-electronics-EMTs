istrator has conﬁgured the SPD to use some security for a
particular trafﬁc ﬂow, then IpSec ﬁrst negotiates the param-
eters involved in securing the trafﬁc ﬂow with the peer host.
These negotiations result in the so-called Security Association
(SA) between the two peers. The SA contains the type of IpSec
mechanism to be applied to the trafﬁc ﬂow (AH or ESP), the
encryption algorithms to be used and the security keys to be
applied. SAs are negotiated using the Internet Key Exchange
(IKE) protocol.
