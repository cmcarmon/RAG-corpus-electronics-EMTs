Now, consider a case where the mass



M


{\displaystyle M}
is not a point mass, but is distributed in a spherically-symmetric distribution about the center, with an average mass density of



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
,




ρ
=

M

π

R

{\displaystyle \rho ={\frac {3M}{4\pi R^{3}}}}
,
where the volume of a sphere is:




(

)

R

.


{\displaystyle {(4/3)\pi R^{3}}.}

Let us assume that the only force acting is gravity. Then, as first demonstrated by Newton, and can easily be demonstrated using the divergence theorem, the acceleration of gravity at any given distance



R


{\displaystyle R}
from the center of the sphere depends only upon the total mass contained within



R


{\displaystyle R}
. The consequence of this result is that if one imagined breaking the sphere up into a series of concentric shells, each shell would collapse only subsequent to the shells interior to it, and no shells cross during collapse. As a result, the free-fall time of a massless particle at



R


{\displaystyle R}
can be expressed solely in terms of the total mass



M


{\displaystyle M}
interior to it. In terms of the average density interior to



R


{\displaystyle R}
, the free-fall time is

{\displaystyle t_{\text{ff}}={\sqrt {\frac {3\pi }{32G\rho }}}\simeq 0.5427{\frac {1}{\sqrt {G\rho }}}\simeq 66430\,{\rm {s}}{\frac {1}{\sqrt {\rho }}}}

where the latter is in SI units.
This result is exactly the same as from the previous section when :

{\displaystyle M\gg m}
