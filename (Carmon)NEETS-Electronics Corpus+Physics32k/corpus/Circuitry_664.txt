leads  are  connected  to  the  ‘+’  and  ‘O’ sockets 
respectively. In Fig. 14.12, the range selector is set 
to  AC,  10  V.  The  pointer  is  reading  mid-way 
between  2  and  3  and  the  indicated  reading  is 
approximately 2.5 V. 
 
Output level measurement 
 
Figure  14.13  shows  how  to  make  output  level 
measurements.  The  red  and  black  test  leads  are 
respectively 
‘O’
respectively. The range selector is set to AC, 10 V 
(note that the output level facility is actually based 
on AC voltage measurement). 
  Output level indications are indicated in decibels 
(dB) where 0 dB (the reference level) corresponds 
to a power level of 1mW in a resistance of 600 G
.
The  pointer  is  reading  mid-way  between  +18  and 
+20  on  the  dB  scale  and  the  indicated  reading  is 
+19 dB. 
 
Resistance 
 
Figure  14.14  shows  how 
to  make  resistance 
measurements. In all three cases, the red and black
