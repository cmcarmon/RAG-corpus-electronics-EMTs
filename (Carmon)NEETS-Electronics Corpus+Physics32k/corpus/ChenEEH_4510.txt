This section serves two purposes. First, it gives a brief (but
general) account on a few of the most important parameter
optimization algorithms, namely the linear least squares (LLS)
method, the Newton’s method, and the Gauss-Newton’s (GN)
method. Second, the discussion applies some of the methods to
the parameter optimization problems arising from the curve-
ﬁtting process. In particular, this section presents a fast algo-
rithm based on the GN method to the minimization of equation
6.19. Excellent textbooks in this ﬁeld are abundant, and this
discussion only refers the reader to a few of them: Gill et al.,
(1981), Dennis and Schnabel (1996), and Stewart (1973).
