Electric and Magnetic Fields
For  the  usual  negative  return  stroke,  measurements  of  the
vertical component of the electric ﬁeld and the two horizontal
components of the magnetic ﬁeld at ground level using wide-
band systems with upper frequency 3-dB points in the 1- to
20-MHz  range  are  well  documented  in  the  literature.  Mea-
sured  vertical  electric  ﬁeld  and  horizontal  magnetic  ﬁeld
waveshapes are shown in Fig. 40.19. Sketches of typical elec-
tric and magnetic ﬁelds are given in Fig. 40.20 for lightning
in the 1- to 5-km range and in Fig. 40.21 for lightning at 10,
15,  50,  and  200  km.  Measured  vertical  and  measured  hori-
zontal electric ﬁelds near ground are shown in Fig. 40.22. The
mean value of the initial peak vertical electric ﬁeld, normal-
ized to 100 km by assuming an inverse distance dependence,
is about 7 V/m for negative ﬁrst strokes and about 4 V/m for
negative subsequent strokes.
