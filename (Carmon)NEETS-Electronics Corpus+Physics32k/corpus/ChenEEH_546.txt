Today, most semiconductor devices are made of silicon. How-
ever, submicron devices made of compound semiconductors,
such as gallium arsenide or indium phosphide, successfully
compete for applications in microwave and ultra-fast digital
circuits. Other semiconductors, such as mercury cadmium
telluride are utilized in infrared detectors. Silicon carbide,
aluminum nitride, and gallium nitride promise to be suitable
for power devices operating at elevated temperatures and in
harsh environments. Hydrogenated amorphous silicon and
related compounds have found important applications in the
display industry and in photovoltaics. Ternary compounds,
quaternary compounds, and heterostructure materials provide
another important dimension to semiconductor technology.
Developing new semiconductor materials and using their
unique properties in electronic industry is a major challenge
that will exist for many years to come.
