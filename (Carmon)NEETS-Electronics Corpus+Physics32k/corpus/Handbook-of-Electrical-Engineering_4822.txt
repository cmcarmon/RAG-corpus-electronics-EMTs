Based on dielectric constant vs. temperature plots, the electromechanical behavior of a relaxor ferroelectric
may divided into three regimes (Fig. 50.1). At temperatures less than Td , the depolarization temperature, the
relaxor material is macropolar, exhibits a stable remanent polarization, and behaves as a piezoelectric. Tmax is
the  temperature  at  which  the  maximum  dielectric  constant  is  observed.  Between  Td  and  Tmax,  the  material
possesses nanometer-scale microdomains that strongly inﬂuence the electromechanical behavior. Large dielec-
tric permittivities and large electrostrictive strains arising from micro–macrodomain reorientation are observed.
Above Tmax, the material is a “true electrostrictor” in that it is paraelectric and exhibits nonhysteretic, quadratic
strain-ﬁeld behavior. Since macroscale domains are absent, no remanent strain is observed. Improved repro-
ducibility in strain and low-loss behavior are achieved.
