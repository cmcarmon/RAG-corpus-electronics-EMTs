With the universal approximation capability for any piecewise
continuous function to any degree of accuracy (Hordik et al.,
1989), artiﬁcial neural networks become one of the most
promising candidates for the online control problems of our
interest. In this research work, neural network is exploited and
used as the online estimator for the unknown failure dynamics.
Some important features of the online learning using neural
networks should ﬁrst be addressed here. The structure of the
online estimator needs to be decided (i.e., in neural networks,
