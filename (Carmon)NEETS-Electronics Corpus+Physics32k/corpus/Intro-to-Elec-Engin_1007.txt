where Ka is the design constant given by P Z/2π α. The value obtained is the speed voltage
appearing across the brush terminals in the quadrature axis (see Figure 12.2.4) due to the ﬁeld
excitation producing φ in the direct axis. For this reason, in the schematic circuit representation of
a dc machine, the ﬁeld axis and the brush axis are shown in quadrature, i.e., perpendicular to each
other. The generated voltage, as observed from the brushes, is the sum of the rectiﬁed voltages of
all the coils in series between brushes. If the number of coils is sufﬁciently large, the ripple in the
waveform of the armature voltage (as a function of time) becomes very small, thereby making
the voltage direct or constant in magnitude.
