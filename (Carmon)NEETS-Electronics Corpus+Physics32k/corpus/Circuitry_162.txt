where Vs, is the supply voltage, t is the time, C is 
the capacitance, and R is the resistance. 
  The current will fall to approximately 37% of the 
initial value of current, Vs /R, in a time equal to the 
time constant.  
  At  the  end  of  the  next  interval  of  time  equal  to 
the time constant (i.e. after a total time of 2CR has 
elapsed)  the  voltage  will  have  fallen  by  a  further 
37% of the remainder, and so on.
