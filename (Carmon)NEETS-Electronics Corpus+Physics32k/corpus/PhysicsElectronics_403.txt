A simple alternative method of establishing a DC reference for the output voltage is by
using a diode clamp as shown in ﬁgure 4.11. By conducting whenever the voltage at the
output terminal of the capacitor goes negative, this circuit builds up an average charge on
the terminal that is suﬃcient to prevent the output from ever going negative. Positive charge
on this terminal is eﬀectively trapped.
