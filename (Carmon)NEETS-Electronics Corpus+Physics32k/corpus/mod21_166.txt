Transistor circuits, other than pulse and power amplifier stages, are usually biased so that the emitter
current is from 0.5 milliampere to 3 milliamperes and the collector voltage is from 3 to 15 volts. You can
measure the emitter current by opening the emitter connector and inserting a milliammeter in series.
When you make this measurement, you should expect some change in bias because of the meter
resistance. You can often determine the collector current by measuring the voltage drop across a resistor
in the collector circuit and calculating the current. If the transistor itself is suspected, it can be tested by
one or more of the methods described below.
