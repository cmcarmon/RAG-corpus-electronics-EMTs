▶✓ Preventing DC current from passing between circuit stages: When con-
nected in series with a signal source (such as a microphone), capacitors 
block DC current but pass AC current. This is known as capacitive cou-
pling or AC coupling, and when used this way, the capacitor is known as 
a coupling capacitor.
Multistage audio systems commonly use this functionality between 
stages so that only the AC portion of the audio signal — the part that 
carries the encoded sound information — from one stage is passed to 
the next stage. Any DC current used to power components in a previous 
stage is removed before the audio signal is amplified.
