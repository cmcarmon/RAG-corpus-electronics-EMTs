EURECA will take this cryogenic detector technology pioneered by CRESST and EDELWEISS further by building a 1 tonne absorber mass made up from a large number of cryogenic detector modules. The experiment plans to use a range of detector materials. This provides a way to show if a positive signal is due to dark matter, as the event rate is expected to scale with the atomic mass of the target nuclei. Whereas the event rate from neutrons will be higher for lighter nuclei.
The EURECA collaboration includes the member institutions of CRESST, EDELWEISS, and ROSEBUD dark matter experiments, and some new members. These are:
Oxford University
Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique
Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique
Max-Planck-Institut für Physik München
Technische Universität München
Universität Tübingen
Universität Karlsruhe
Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe
JINR
Universidad de Zaragoza
INR Kiev
CERN
The collaboration spokesman is Gilles Gerbier. The experiment will be built in the Modane Underground Laboratory, in the Fréjus road tunnel between France and Italy, the deepest underground laboratory in Europe.
