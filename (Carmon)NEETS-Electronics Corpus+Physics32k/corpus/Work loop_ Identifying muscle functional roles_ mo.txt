As a “motor” the muscle does work on the environment resulting in positive work in the work loop in the counter-clockwise direction. When positive work happens the length of the muscle will increase followed by an increase in force before reaching a peak. When the peak is reached the muscle will shorten along with a decrease in force. An example of positive work being done in the environment would be scallops swimming.
As a “brake” the muscle is able to absorb energy from the environment. This then results in negative work in the work loop in a clockwise direction. The result is a shortening of the muscles as well as a decrease in force output. After the muscle is done absorbing the energy from the environment, the length of the muscle then returns to normal with increased force. In cockroaches, there are legs that act purely as “brakes” to stop the animal’s movement.
As a “spring” the muscles are able to alter between states of motion, thus producing negative work this negative work results from the movement and changing of the muscles position in bird flight and human legs in order to produce more energy. The “springs” in these muscles absorb the energy from the environment and redirect it, then outputting that absorbed energy to make repeated movements more energy efficient.
As a “strut” the muscle can output a force and then hold the muscle length. In fish movement the body moves back and forth to produce work but as the fish moves the muscles move the energy down the length of the fish. As the energy passes the muscle the muscle then holds as a “strut”. The length of the muscle as a “strut” remains constant.
