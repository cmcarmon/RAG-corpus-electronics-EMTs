Input  devices  are  those  portions  of  computer,  data  processing,  and  information  systems  that  perform  the
essential function of providing some means for entering commands and data into the system. Therefore, input
devices are found in all such systems, but are treated here as a separate equipment group, independent of the
total  system  conﬁguration.  However,  the  place  of  input  devices  in  a  representative  computer  system  may  be
clariﬁed by reference to Fig. 89.1(a), which shows the interface of the main input device categories in relation
to the portions of the generalized system that accept the inputs. The categories and the devices listed in Table 89.1
are the subject of this section.
