Recall from Section 4.2.3 that it is frequently possible to make
two simple choices (concerning equation 4.7) characterizing
the clock skews and delays in a circuit, such that both zero and
double clocking violations are avoided. Speciﬁcally, if equal
values are chosen for all clock delays and a sufﬁciently large
value—larger than the longest delay ^DDi, f
PM —is chosen for TCP,
neither of these two clocking hazards will occur. Formally,
