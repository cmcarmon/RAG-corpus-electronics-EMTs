(cid:1) Conservation of energy is a powerful method for obtaining many types of
results in circuits. Energy methods are intuitive and can often allow us to
obtain powerful results without a lot of mathematical grunge. One energy
approach equates the energy supplied by a set of elements in a circuit to
the energy absorbed by the remaining set of elements in a circuit. Another
energy approach equates the total amount of energy in a system at two
different points in time (assuming that there are no dissipative elements in
the circuit).
