out signals fY(t) and [fI(t) + fQ(t)], which is further processed by two synchronous detectors in
quadrature to recover SI(t) and SQ(t). An appropriate matrix combines fY(t), SI(t), and SQ(t) to yield
close approximations of the originally transmitted mR(t), mG(t), and mB(t). These three signals
control the three electron beams in the picture tube.
