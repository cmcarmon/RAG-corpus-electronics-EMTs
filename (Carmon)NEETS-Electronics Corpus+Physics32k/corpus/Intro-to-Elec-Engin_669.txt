Junction FETs (JFETs)
The JFET is a three-terminal, voltage-controlled current device, whereas the BJT is principally
a three-terminal, current-controlled current device. The advantages associated with JFETs are
much higher input resistance (on the order of 107 to 1010 ), lower noise, easier fabrication, and
in some cases even the ability to handle higher currents and powers. The disadvantages, on the
other hand, are slower speeds in switching circuits and smaller bandwidth for a given gain in an
ampliÔ¨Åer.
