As in all superheterodyne receivers, controlling the frequency of the local oscillator keeps the
receiver tuned. Since this tuning is critical, some form of automatic frequency control (afc) is essential to
avoid constant manual tuning. Automatic frequency control circuits mix an attenuated portion of the
transmitted signal with the local oscillator signal to form an IF signal. This signal is applied to a
frequency-sensitive discriminator that produces an output voltage proportional in amplitude and polarity
to any change in IF frequency. If the IF signal is at the discriminator center frequency, no discriminator
output occurs. The center frequency of the discriminator is essentially a reference frequency for the IF
signal. The output of the DISCRIMINATOR provides a control voltage to maintain the local oscillator at
the correct frequency.
