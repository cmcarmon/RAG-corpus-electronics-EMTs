Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling and simulation for phase change materials (PCMs) is a technique to analyze the performance and behavior of PCMs. The CFD models have been successful in studying and analyzing the air quality, natural ventilation and stratified ventilation, air flow initiated by buoyancy forces and temperature space for the systems integrated with PCMs. Simple shapes like flat plates, cylinders or annular tubes,fins, macro- and micro-encapsulations with containers of different shape are often modeled in CFD software's to study.
Typically the CFD models generally include Reynold’s Averaged Navier-Stokes equation (RANS) modeling and Large Eddy Simulation (LES). Conservation equations of mass, momentum and energy (Navier – Stokes) are linearised, discretised, and applied to finite volumes to obtain a detailed solution for field distributions of air pressure, velocity and temperature for both indoor spaces integrated with PCMs.
