Applying Eq. (33.16) or (33.17) to the transfer of heat from the case of a chip module to the coolant, the
external  resistance,  Rex  =  1/hA,  is  found  to  be  inversely  proportional  to  the  wetted  area  and  to  the  coolant
velocity to the 0.5 to 0.8 power and directly proportional to the length in the ﬂow direction to the 0.5 to 0.2
power.  It  may,  thus,  be  observed  that  the  external  resistance  can  be  strongly  inﬂuenced  by  the  ﬂuid  velocity
and package dimensions and that these factors must be addressed in any meaningful evaluation of the external
thermal resistances offered by various packaging technologies.
