For TTL and ECL, PDP is on the order of 100 pJ; for NMOS it is around 10 pJ. Slower
versions of I2L can operate at 1 pJ per change. The average power consumption in CMOS is
linearly proportional to the data rate. CMOS, run at maximum speed, has comparable PDP to
that of NMOS. By reducing logic swing and/or device capacitance, the PDP can be reduced.
Improvements in PDP can also be achieved by making conventional circuits physically smaller
with consequent increased package density. Microfabrication technologies have gradually reduced
the minimum feature size, which refers to the typical minimum dimension used in an IC.
