As studied in NEETS, Module 10, Introduction to Wave Propagation, Transmission Lines, and 
Antennas, radio frequencies do not have the limitations just described for voice frequencies. Radio waves, 
given a suitable antenna, can often radiate millions of miles into space. Several methods of modulation 
can be used to impress voices frequencies onto radio waves for transmission through space.
