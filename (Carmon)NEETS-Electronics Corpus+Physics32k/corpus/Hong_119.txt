A major advantage of active filters is that they can be designed to have high input 
impedance  and  low  output  impedance.  This  means  that  the  signal  load  can  be  isolated 
from  the  signal  source  and  therefore  filter  sections  can  be  chained  together  like 
LEGOâ€™sTM  in  order  to  obtain  a  filter  with  a  higher-order  response.  As  a  pleasant 
consequence, each filter section can provide gain to the desired signal as required to suit 
the needs of the system.
