The ground reaction force creates external moments on the joints of the lower limb. Activation of muscles and other passive connective tissues (e.g., ligaments, tendons) create what is known as internal moments that control joint motions. When a joint motion occurs in the direction of a muscle’s action it is concentrically acting. If a joint motion occurs in the opposite direction of a muscle’s action then the muscle is eccentrically acting. Therefore, the magnitude of the internal moment reasonably matches the described muscular activations.
