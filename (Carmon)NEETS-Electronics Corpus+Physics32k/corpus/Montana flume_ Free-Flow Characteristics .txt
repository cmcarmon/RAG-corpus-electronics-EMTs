The Montana Flume is a restriction with free-spilling discharge that accelerates flow from a sub-critical state (Fr~0.5) to a supercritical one (Fr>1).
The free-flow discharge can be summarized as




Q
=
C

H

a


n




{\displaystyle Q=CH_{a}^{n}}

Where
Q is flow rate
C is the free-flow coefficient for the flume
Ha is the head at the primary point of measurement
n varies with flume size (See Table 1 below)
