A semiconductor diode is a two‐terminal electronic device that consists of a 
single pn‐junction. (See Figure 9­3.) Diodes act like one‐way valves, allowing 
current to flow in only one direction when a voltage is applied to them. This 
capability is sometimes referred to as the rectifying property.
