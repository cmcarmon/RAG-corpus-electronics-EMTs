Or, if you’ve always been curious about, say, how transistors work, you can 
jump right into Chapter 10, find out about those amazing little three‐legged 
components, and build a couple of transistor circuits. With a chapter each 
focused on resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, transistors, and inte-
grated circuits (ICs), you can direct your energy to a single chapter to master 
the component of your choice.
