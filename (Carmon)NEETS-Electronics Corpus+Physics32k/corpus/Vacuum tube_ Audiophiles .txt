Enough people prefer tube sound to make tube amplifiers commercially viable in three areas: musical instrument (guitar) amplifiers, devices used in recording studios, and audiophile equipment.
Many guitarists prefer using valve amplifiers to solid-state models, often due to the way they tend to distort when overdriven. (Any amplifier can only accurately amplify a signal to a certain volume; past this limit, the amplifier will begin to distort the signal. Different circuits will distort the signal in different ways; some guitarists prefer the distortion characteristics of vacuum tubes.) Most popular vintage models use vacuum tubes.
