Together the package pin, the bond wire, and the internal chip wire are associated
with a nonzero parasitic inductance. In this problem, we will study the effect of the
parasitic inductance associated with power supply connections. Figure 10.107 shows
a model of our situation. Two inverters with load resistors R1 and R2 and MOSFETs
with width-to-length ratios W1/L1 and W2/L2, respectively, are connected to the same
power supply node on the chip that is labeled with a voltage vP. Ideally this chip-level
power supply node would be extended with an ideal wire outside the chip to the external
power supply VS shown in Figure 10.107. However, notice the parasitic inductance LP
interposed between the power supply node on the chip (marked with voltage vP) and
the external power supply node (marked with voltage VS.)
