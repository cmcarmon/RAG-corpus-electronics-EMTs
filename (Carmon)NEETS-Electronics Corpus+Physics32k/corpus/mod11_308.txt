Horn radiators are constructed in a variety of shapes, as illustrated in figure 3-9. The shape of the 
horn determines the shape of the field pattern. The ratio of the horn length to the size of its mouth 
determines the beam angle and directivity. In general, the larger the mouth of the horn, the more directive 
is the field pattern.
