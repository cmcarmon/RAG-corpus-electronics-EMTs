Notice that for this equality to hold even when Path 1 and Path 2 are chosen
independently, each integral must be independent of path. It follows from this
−(cid:4)
that the computed voltage Vyx between any pair of points x and y given by
x E · dl is independent of the path.2 Thus, we have our desired outcome:
We can ascribe a unique potential difference or voltage across the terminals x
and y, provided
