As a direct generalization of a vector space, a module M
replaces the underlying ﬁeld by a ring R. Technically speaking,
M is a left module because the scalar appears left of the
module element. In an analogous fashion, a module M over
the ring R is an R-module M. From this discussion, it is
apparent that if R is also a ﬁeld, R-modules are merely vector
spaces. In working with modules, it is important to remember
to avoid any vector space results relying on division by a
nonzero scalar. It is precisely this notion that leads to the
extremely powerful application of modules in system analysis,
controllability, and observability.
