The distributed constants of resistance, inductance, and capacitance are basic properties common to
all transmission lines and exist whether or not any current flow exists. As soon as current flow and
voltage exist in a transmission line, another property becomes quite evident. This is the presence of an
electromagnetic field, or lines of force, about the wires of the transmission line. The lines of force
themselves are not visible; however, understanding the force that an electron experiences while in the
field of these lines is very important to your understanding of energy transmission.
