Figure  10.5  shows  another  circuit  with 
two 
switches.  This  circuit  differs  from  that  shown  in 
Fig. 10.3 by virtue of the fact that the two switches 
are  connected  in  parallel  rather  than  in  series.  In 
this  case  the  lamp  will  operate  when  either  of  the 
two switches is closed. As before, there is a total of 
four  possible  conditions  for  the  circuit.  We  can 
summarize these conditions in Table 10.3. 
  Once  again,  adopting  the  convention  that  an 
open switch can be represented by 0 and a closed 
switch by 1, we can rewrite the truth table in terms 
of the binary states as shown in Fig. 10.6.
