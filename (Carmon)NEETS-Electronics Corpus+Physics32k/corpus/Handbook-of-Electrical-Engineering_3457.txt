When the target thermal resistance is known, ﬁrst-order (or “back-of-the-envelope”) calculations are performed
to evaluate the severity of the thermal management problem. Although some designs can be completed at this stage,
often more precise calculations are needed to verify that the proposed approach does indeed meet the target thermal
resistance value. Such calculations can be performed analytically by drawing on the wealth of knowledge in the
thermal sciences, numerically using commercial general purpose software, or with commercial software speciﬁcally
tailored to the thermoﬂuid and thermostructural conﬁgurations encountered in packaging. Due to the difﬁculty
in predicting thermal contact resistances at lightly and variably loaded mechanical interfaces and in determining
the convective resistances associated with irregular package and printed circuit board geometries, some experimental
data is generally needed to establish key parameters or verify system performance.
