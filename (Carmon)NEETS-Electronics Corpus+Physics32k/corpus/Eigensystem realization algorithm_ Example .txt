Consider a single degree of freedom (SDOF) system with stiffness



k


{\displaystyle k}
, mass



m


{\displaystyle m}
, and damping



c


{\displaystyle c}
. The equation of motion for this SDOF is




m



x
¨



(
t
)
+
c



x
˙



(
t
)
+
k
x
(
t
)
=
p
(
t
)


{\displaystyle m{\ddot {x}}(t)+c{\dot {x}}(t)+kx(t)=p(t)}

where



x


{\displaystyle x}
is the displacement of the mass and



t


{\displaystyle t}
is time. The continuous state-space representation of this system is







s
˙

s

{\displaystyle {\dot {s}}=As(t)+Bu(t)}





y
=
C
s
(
t
)
+
D
u
(
t
)


{\displaystyle y=Cs(t)+Du(t)}

where



s


{\displaystyle s}
represent the states of the system corresponding to the displacement



x


{\displaystyle x}
and velocity






x

{\displaystyle {\dot {x}}}
of the SDOF. Note that the states are usually denoted by



x


{\displaystyle x}
. However, here



x


{\displaystyle x}
is used for the SDOF displacement.
