The force required to detach an ideal suction cup by pulling it directly away from the surface is given by the formula:




F
=
A
P


{\displaystyle F=AP}

where:
F is the force,
A is the area of the surface covered by the cup,
P is the pressure outside the cup (typically atmospheric pressure)
This is derived from the definition of pressure, which is:




P
=
F

/

A


{\displaystyle P=F/A}

For example, a suction cup of radius 2.0 cm has an area of



Ï€


{\displaystyle \pi }
(0.020 m)2 = 0.0013 square meters. Using the force formula (F = AP), the result is F = (0.0013 m2)(100,000 Pa) = about 130 newtons.
The above formula relies on several assumptions:
The outer diameter of the cup does not change when the cup is pulled.
No air leaks into the gap between the cup and the surface.
The pulling force is applied perpendicular to the surface so that the cup does not slide sideways or peel off.
