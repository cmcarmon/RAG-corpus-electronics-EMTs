The ﬁrst LANs—developed in the early 1970s—were proprietary products meant to interconnect one vendor’s
computer products. By 1980, however, Project 802 of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
had recognized the need for publicly disseminated LAN standards and eventually published a speciﬁcation of
the  CSMA/CD  protocol  that  any  vendor  may  implement.  Furthermore,  the  deﬁnition  of  the  standard  was
sanctioned by companies that participated in the IEEE Working Group’s balloting process, so that the standard
was  viewed  as  an  open,  nonproprietary  solution.  The  IEEE  802.3 Working  Group  chose  a  protocol  that  was
based closely on the Ethernet LAN originally developed at Xerox by Robert Metcalfe and David Boggs.
