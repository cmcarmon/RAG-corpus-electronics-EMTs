Transformer Impedance
Impedance is an inherent property in a transformer that results in a voltage drop as power is transferred from
the primary to the secondary side of the power system. The impedance of a transformer consists of two parts:
resistance (R) and reactance (X). The resistance component is due to the resistance of the material of the winding
and  the  percentage  value  of  the  voltage  drop  due  to  resistance  becomes  less  as  the  rating  of  the  transformer
increases. The reactive component, which is also known as leakage reactance, is the result of incomplete linkage
of the magnetic Ô¨Åeld set up by the secondary winding with the turns of the primary winding, and vice versa.
The net impedance of the transformer is given by Z = 
. The impedance value marked on the trans-
former is the percentage voltage drop due to this impedance under full-load operating conditions:
