Passive  components  do  not  require  any  electric  Ô¨Åelds  and  are  used  for  power  splitting  and  combining
functions.  Two  types  of  passive  power  division  structures  have  been  fabricated: Y-junctions  and  directional
couplers.  A  single  waveguide  can  be  split  into  two  by  fabricating  a  shallow-angle  Y-junction  as  shown  in
Fig. 31.17.
