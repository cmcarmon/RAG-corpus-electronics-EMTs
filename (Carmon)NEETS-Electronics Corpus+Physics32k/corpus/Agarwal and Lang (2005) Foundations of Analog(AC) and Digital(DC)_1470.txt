One possible form of this solution is sketched in Figure 10.34. This example
illustrates one of the advantages of the state-variable approach. Once we have
found the solution for some input waveform and zero initial conditions, the
solution for the same input with arbitrary initial conditions can be found by
adding the appropriate ZIR solution.
