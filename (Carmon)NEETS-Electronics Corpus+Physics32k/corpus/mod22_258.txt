screen. You then insert the operating system floppy disk into the drive A. Type a B (for boot) and press 
the RETURN key. The operating system will load from the disk. If you are using a system set up for 
automatic booting, you won't have to type the B. The system automatically loads the operating system 
when you insert the disk that contains it. Some systems will then ask for date and time. Enter these. You 
will next see a prompt, usually A> (or A:). The system is ready and drive A is assigned as your primary 
drive. One thing you might want to do is to display the disk directory to see what is on the disk. To do 
this, enter DIR following the A>. This will list your files.
