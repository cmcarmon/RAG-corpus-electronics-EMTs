I = -5 mA
The negative (-) sign on the value of 5 milliamps tells us that the current is exiting the
node, as opposed to the 2 milliamp and 3 milliamp currents, which must both be positive (and
therefore entering the node). Whether negative or positive denotes current entering or exiting
is entirely arbitrary, so long as they are opposite signs for opposite directions and we stay
consistent in our notation, KCL will work.
