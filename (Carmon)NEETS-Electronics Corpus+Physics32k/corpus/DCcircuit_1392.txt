Equivalent circuit: Since inductor wire has some resistance, and circuit design constraints
typically demand the inductor be built to the smallest possible dimensions, there is no such
thing as a ”perfect” inductor.
Inductor coil wire usually presents a substantial amount of
series resistance, and the close spacing of wire from one coil turn to another (separated by
insulation) may present measurable amounts of stray capacitance to interact with its purely
inductive characteristics. Unlike capacitors, which are relatively easy to manufacture with
negligible stray effects, inductors are difﬁcult to ﬁnd in ”pure” form. In certain applications,
these undesirable characteristics may present signiﬁcant engineering problems.
