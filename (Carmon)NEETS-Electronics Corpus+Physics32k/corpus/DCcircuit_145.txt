It must be understood that neither voltage nor current by themselves constitute power.
Rather, power is the combination of both voltage and current in a circuit. Remember that
voltage is the speciﬁc work (or potential energy) per unit charge, while current is the rate at
which electric charges move through a conductor. Voltage (speciﬁc work) is analogous to the
work done in lifting a weight against the pull of gravity. Current (rate) is analogous to the
speed at which that weight is lifted. Together as a product (multiplication), voltage (work) and
current (rate) constitute power.
