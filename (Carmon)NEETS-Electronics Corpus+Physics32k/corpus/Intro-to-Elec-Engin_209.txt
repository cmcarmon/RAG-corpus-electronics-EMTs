The preceding equations resemble the Ohmâ€™s law relation. The quantities R, sL, and 1/sC have the
dimension of ohms, whereas G, 1/sL, and sC have the dimension of siemens, or 1/ohm. The ratio
of voltage to current in the frequency domain at a pair of terminals is known as the impedance,
designated by Z(s), whereas that of current to voltage is called the admittance, designated by
