The ﬁrst automatic star trackers were built in the late 1950s. They measured the azimuth and elevation of
stars relative to a gyroscopically stabilized platform. Approximate position measurements by dead reckoning
allowed the telescope to point within a fraction of a degree of the desired star. Thus, a narrow ﬁeld-of-view
was possible, permitting the telescope and photodetector to track stars in the daytime. An on-board computer
stored the right ascension and declination of 20–100 stars and computed the vehicle’s position. Automatic star
trackers are used in long-range military aircraft and on space shuttles in conjunction with inertial navigators.
Clever design of the optics and of stellar-inertial signal-processing ﬁlters achieves accuracies better than 500 ft
