Another technique used to broaden the bandpass involves the amount of coupling in the
transformers. For transformers, the term "coupling" refers to the amount of energy transferred from the
primary to the secondary of the transformer. This depends upon the number of flux lines from the primary
that intersect, or cut, the secondary. When more flux lines cut the secondary, more energy is transferred.
