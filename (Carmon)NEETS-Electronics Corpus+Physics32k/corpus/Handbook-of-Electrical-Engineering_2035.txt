Implemented  in  a  real-time “binaural  mixing  console,”  the  above  scheme  can  be  used  to  create “virtual”
sound sources. When combined with an appropriate scheme for interpolating head-related transfer functions,
moving sound sources can be mimicked realistically. Furthermore, it is possible to superimpose early reﬂections
of  a  hypothetical  recording  room,  each  ﬁlterered  by  the  appropriate  head-related  transfer  function.  Such
inclusion of a room in the simulation makes the spatial reproduction more robust against individual differences
between “recording”  and “listening”  ears,  in  particular,  if  the  listener’s  head  movements  are  fed  back  to  the
binaural mixing console. (Head movements are useful for disambiguating spatial cues.) Finally, such a system
can be used to create “virtual acoustic displays,” for example, for pilots and astronauts [Wenzel, 1992]. Other
research  issues  are,  for  example,  the  required  accuracy  of  the  head-related  transfer  functions,  intersubject
variability, and psychoacoustic aspects of room simulations.
