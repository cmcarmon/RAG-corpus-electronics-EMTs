When Benjamin Franklin made his conjecture regarding the direction of charge ﬂow (from
the smooth wax to the rough wool), he set a precedent for electrical notation that exists to
this day, despite the fact that we know electrons are the constituent units of charge, and that
they are displaced from the wool to the wax – not from the wax to the wool – when those
two substances are rubbed together. This is why electrons are said to have a negative charge:
because Franklin assumed electric charge moved in the opposite direction that it actually does,
and so objects he called ”negative” (representing a deﬁciency of charge) actually have a surplus
of electrons.
