We assume that the damping

is sufficiently strong that, in the absence of the driving force



E


{\displaystyle E}
, the amplitude of the parametric oscillations does not diverge, i.e., that



α

<

{\displaystyle \alpha t<D}
. In this situation, the parametric pumping acts to lower the effective damping in the system. For illustration, let the damping be constant
