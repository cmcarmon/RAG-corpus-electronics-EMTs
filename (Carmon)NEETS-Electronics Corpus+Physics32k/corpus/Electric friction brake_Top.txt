Electric Friction Brake, often referred to as just Electric Brake or Electric Trailer Brake is a brake controlled by an electric current and can be seen on medium duty trailers like caravans/RVs and Consumer-Grade Car Trailers. It is related to the Electromagnetic track brake used in railways which also uses electric current to directly control the brake force.
