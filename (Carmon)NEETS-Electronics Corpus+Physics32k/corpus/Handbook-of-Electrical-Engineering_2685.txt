What Is Layout?
For a speciﬁc circuit, a layout speciﬁes the position and dimension of the different layers of materials as they
would be laid on the silicon wafer. However, the layout description is only a symbolic representation, which
simpliﬁes  the  description  of  the  actual  fabrication  process.  For  example,  the  layout  representation  does  not
explicitly indicate the thickness of the layers, thickness of oxide coating, amount of ionization in the transistors
channels, etc., but these factors are implicitly understood in the fabrication process. Some of the main layers
p
-diffusion, poly, metal-1, and metal-2. Each of these layers is
used in any layout description are 
represented by a polygon of a particular color or pattern. As an example, Fig. 25.4 presents a speciﬁc pattern
for each layer that will be used through the rest of this section.
