In a Hesitation Mitchell, the EW pair arriving at the highest numbered table rotate to sit NS at that table on the next round, and then move to Table 1. With an odd number of tables, this allows one more round to be played than the number of tables. For example, with 24 boards and seven tables, eight rounds can be played. A bye stand table will also be needed opposite the hesitation table; in this case between tables 3 and 4.
In a Double Hesitation Mitchell, there are two points where EW move to NS, though not normally at directly rotating tables. With an even number of tables, this allows two more rounds to be played than the number of tables. For example, with 24 boards and 6 tables, eight rounds can be played. Two bye stand tables will also be needed. The position of the rotations and bye stand tables must be chosen precisely, otherwise a conflict will arise, so table cards are needed.
