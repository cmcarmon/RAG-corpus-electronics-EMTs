Before discussing oscillators further, let's review the requirements for an oscillator. First, 
amplification is required to provide the necessary gain for the signal. Second, sufficient regenerative 
feedback is required to sustain oscillations. Third, a frequency-determining device is needed to maintain 
the desired output frequency.
