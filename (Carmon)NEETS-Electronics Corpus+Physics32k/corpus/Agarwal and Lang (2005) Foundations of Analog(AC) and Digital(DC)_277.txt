Note that the paths along the loops have been defined so that each branch voltage is
traversed positively around exactly one loop and negatively around exactly one loop.
It is for this reason that each branch voltage appears exactly once in Equations 2.13
through 2.16 positively, and exactly once negatively. As with the application of KCL,
such patterns can often be used to spot errors.
