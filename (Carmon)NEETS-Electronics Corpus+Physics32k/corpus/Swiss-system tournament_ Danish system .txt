The Danish system works in principle like a Swiss system, only without the restriction that no players can meet for a second time, so it is always #1 vs. #2, #3 vs. #4 etc.
Bridge team tournaments, if not played as "Round Robin", usually start with the Swiss system to make sure that the same teams would not play against each other frequently, but in the last one or two rounds there is a switch to the Danish system, especially to allow the first two ranked teams to battle against each other for the victory, even if they have met before during the tournament.
