power supply, and the output goes low (0 volts), 
current will flow through the resistor into the 
IC — the IC sinks the current. If you connect a 
resistor between the output pin and the nega-
tive supply (ground), and the output goes high, 
current will flow out of the IC and through the 
resistor — the IC sources the current. Refer to 
the datasheet for the maximum source or sink 
current (which are usually the same value) of 
an IC output.
