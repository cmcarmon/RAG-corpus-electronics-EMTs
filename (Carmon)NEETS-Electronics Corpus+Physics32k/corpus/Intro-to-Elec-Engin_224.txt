In constructing a phasor diagram, each sinusoidal voltage and current is represented by a
phasor of length equal to the rms value of the sinusoid, and with an angular displacement from
the positive real axis, which is the angle of the equivalent cosine function at t = 0. This use of the
cosine is arbitrary, and so also the use of the rms value. Formulation in terms of the sine function
could just as well have been chosen, and the amplitude rather than the rms value could have
been chosen for the magnitude. While phasor diagrams can be drawn to scale, they are usually
sketched as a visual check of the algebraic solution of a problem, especially since the KVL and
KCL equations can be shown as graphical addition.
The reference of a phasor diagram is the line Î¸ = 0. It is not really necessary that any voltage
or current phasor coincide with the reference, even though it is often more convenient for the
