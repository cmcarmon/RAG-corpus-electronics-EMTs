All memory (internal storage) sections must contain facilities to store computer data or instructions 
(that are intelligible to the computer) until these instructions or data are needed in the performance of the 
computer calculations. Before the stored-program computer can begin to process input data, it is first 
necessary to store in its memory a sequence of instructions, and tables of constants and other data it will 
use in its computations. The process by which these instructions and data are read into the computer is 
called loading.
