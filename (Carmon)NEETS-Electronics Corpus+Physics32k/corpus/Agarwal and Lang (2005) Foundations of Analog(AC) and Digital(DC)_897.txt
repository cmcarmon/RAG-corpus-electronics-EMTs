Observe further that the transfer curve for the buffer passes through the
forbidden region. Doesnâ€™t this violate our initial premise that voltages in the
forbidden region were disallowed? Recall that the static discipline requires
the logic gate to guarantee valid outputs only for valid inputs. That the outputs
are in the forbidden region when the inputs are invalid is of no consequence.
