Sound waves travel through any medium to a velocity that is controlled by the medium. Varying the
frequency and intensity of the sound waves will not affect the speed of propagation. The ELASTICITY
and DENSITY of a medium are the two basic physical properties that govern the velocity of sound
through the medium.
