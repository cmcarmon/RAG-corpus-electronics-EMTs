Theorem 5. Let  Pk  designate  the  projection  operators  onto  the  closed  convex  sets Ck  for  k  =  1,  2,  ...,  m  of
Hilbert space X and C = C1˙ C2˙  . . . ˙ Cm be their nonempty closed convex set intersection. Furthermore,
for every x ˛  X consider the sequence of successive projections as generated according to
