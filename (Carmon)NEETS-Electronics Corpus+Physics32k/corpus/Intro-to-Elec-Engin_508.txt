When a sum term contains each of the n variables of a function, it is called a maxterm. The
ith maxterm of n variables, denoted by Mi, is the complement of the ith minterm mi of the same
n variables; that is to say, Mi = mi. Table 6.1.4 lists the eight possible maxterms and minterms
of the three variables A, B, and C.
