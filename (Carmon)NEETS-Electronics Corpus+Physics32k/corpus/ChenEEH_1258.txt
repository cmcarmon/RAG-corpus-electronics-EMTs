In writing the microprogram, there are two situations in
which one may want to leave a ﬁeld of the microinstruction
blank. When a ﬁeld that controls a functional unit or that
causes state to be written (such as the memory ﬁeld of the
ALU destination ﬁeld) is blank, no control signals should be
asserted. When a ﬁeld only speciﬁes the control of a multi-
plexor that determines the input to a functional unit, leaving it
blank means that one does not care about the input to the
functional unit. The easiest way to understand the micropro-
gram is to break in into pieces that deal with each component
of instruction execution. The ﬁrst component of every instruc-
tion execution is to fetch the instructions, decode them, and
compute both the sequential PC and branch target PC.
