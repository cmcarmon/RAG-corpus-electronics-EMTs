The  life  requirement  is  estimated  on  the  basis  of  workstation  users  operating  at  approximately  half  the
accepted rate of 20 million actuations per key used for electronic typewriters. The actual layout and content
of the keyboard may vary greatly, ranging from the standard typewriter arrangement, through different com-
binations of alphanumerics and symbols, to the special-function keyboards that contain legends and symbols
speciﬁc to the particular application. However, the outputs of each type are the same in that they must contain
coded signals that relate the action to be performed by the information system to that deﬁned by the key being
operated, in terms of the input code of the system. Thus, many of the keyboards output the ASCII code, and
the system is usually designed so that it can accept this type of standard code. Incidentally, ASCII, the acronym
for American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is the standard means for encoding alphanumerics
and a group of selected symbols for transmission to a display system, among others. It is the standard code
used  in  the  United  States  and  most  other  English-speaking  countries  and  corresponds  to  the  ISO  seven-bit
code. The seven-bit ASCII is usually used, and it should be noted that for serial data transmission an eighth
bit is added for parity. Various keyboard arrangements are possible, and many variants are found in particular
applications. The means for coding the key operation may be through magnetic reed relays, solid-state circuits,
or  more  exotic  devices  such  as  Hall  effect  sensors.  These  device  characteristics  are  only  incidental  to  the
operation  and  beyond  the  scope  of  this  chapter.  Similarly,  we  do  not  discuss  the  human-factors  aspects  of
keyboard design, not because they are not important, but because, apart from the visual considerations, the
other factors have to do with tactile and physical features best left to others.
