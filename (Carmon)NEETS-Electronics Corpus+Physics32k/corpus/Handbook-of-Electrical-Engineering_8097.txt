n, in the p-type region will
lead  to  radiation  of  the  photon  desired,  but  others  will  not,  because  of  the  existence  of  doping  and  various
impurity levels in the bandgap. The total recombination rate, R, can be written in terms of the radiative and
nonradiative rates, Rr and Rnr, as
