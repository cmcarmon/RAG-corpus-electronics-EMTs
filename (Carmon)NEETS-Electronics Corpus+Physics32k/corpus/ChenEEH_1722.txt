Khokhar et al. (1999) introduced a multilevel architecture
for video data in which semantics are shared among various
levels. An object-oriented paradigm is proposed for manage-
ment of information at higher levels of abstraction. For each
video sequence to be indexed, they ﬁrst identiﬁed objects
inside the video sequence, their sizes and locations, and their
relative positions and movements, they encoded this informa-
tion in a spatiotemporal model. This approach integrates both
intraclip and interclip modeling and uses both bottom-up as
well as top-down object-oriented data abstraction concepts.
Decleir et al. (1999) have developed a data model that goes one
step beyond the existing stratiﬁcation-based approaches using
generalized intervals. Here instead of a time segment to be
associated with a description, a set of time segments is associ-
ated with a description—an approach that allows handling
with a single object all occurrences of an entity in a video
document. Also proposed was a declarative, rule-based, con-
straint query language that can be used to infer relationships
from information represented in the model and to intention-
ally specify relationships among objects.
