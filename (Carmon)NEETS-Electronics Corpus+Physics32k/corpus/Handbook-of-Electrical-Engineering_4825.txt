The  mechanical  quality  factor  QM  for  PMN  is  8100  (at  a  ﬁeld  of  ~200 kV/m)  compared  with  300  for
poled  barium  titanate  or  75  for  poled  PZT  5-A  [Nomura  and  Uchino,  1981].  The  induced  piezoelectric
coefﬁcients d33 and d31 can vary with ﬁeld (Fig. 50.4). The maxima in the induced piezoelectric coefﬁcients
for PMN as a function of biasing electric ﬁeld are at E ~ 1.2 MV/m, with d33 = 240 pC/N and –d31 = 72 pC/N.
Pb(Mg0.3Nb0.6Ti0.1)O3  is  a  very  active  composition,  with  a  maximum  d33 =  1300 pC/N  at  a  biasing  ﬁeld  of
3.7 kV/cm.
