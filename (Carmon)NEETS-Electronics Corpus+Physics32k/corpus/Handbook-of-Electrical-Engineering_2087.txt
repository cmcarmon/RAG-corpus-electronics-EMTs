1Ray tracing models are used for high-frequency signals and in deep water. Generally, if the depth-to-wavelength ratio is
100  or  more,  ray  tracing  models  are  accurate.  Below  that,  corrections  must  be  made  to  the  ray  trace  models.  In  shallow
water or low frequencies, i.e., when depth-to-wavelength is about 30 or less, “mode theory” models are used.
