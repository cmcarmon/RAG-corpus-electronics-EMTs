Tri-Phones
In order to take into account the inﬂuence of context on pronunciation, many speech recognizers base their
modeling on the tri-phone concept. The tri-phone concept was ﬁrst introduced by Chow et al. [5, 24] and Lee
et  al.  [7,  8]  in  the  1980s.  In  this  concept,  the  pronunciation  of  a  phone  is  inﬂuenced  by  the  preceding  and
following phone (i.e., the triplet is used to model the realization of the phone). The phone p embedded in the
context p1 and p2 is speciﬁed by the tri-phone p1pp2, where p1 and p2 are the previous and the following phones.
Different such realizations of p are called allophones. This amounts to saying that the contextual inﬂuence of
the preceding and following phone is most important. If this solution were carried out literally, the resulting
allophone alphabet would be too large to be useful. For example, a phonetic alphabet of size M would produce
M3 allophones. Even though in practice, not all M3 allophones occur, the number of possible allophones is still
large.
