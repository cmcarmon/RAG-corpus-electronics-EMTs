Switching power supplies use power semiconductor switches in the on and off switching states resulting in
high efﬁciency, small size, and light weight. With the availability of fast switching devices, HF magnetics and
capacitors, and high-speed control ICs, switching power supplies have become very popular. They can be further
classiﬁed as pulsewidth-modulated (PWM) converters and resonant converters, and they are explained below.
