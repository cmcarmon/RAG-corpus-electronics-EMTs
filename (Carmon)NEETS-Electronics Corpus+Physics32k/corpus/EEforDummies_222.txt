two input contacts and four output contacts (for a total of six terminals), 
and behaves like two SPDT (changeover) switches operating in sync. In 
one position, the two input contacts are connected to one set of output 
contacts. In the other position, the two input contacts are connected to 
the other set of output contacts. Some DPDT switches have a third posi-
tion, which disconnects (or breaks) all contacts. You can use a DPDT 
switch as a reversing switch for a motor, connecting the motor to positive 
voltage to turn one way, negative voltage to turn the other way, and, if 
there is a third switch position, zero voltage to stop turning.
