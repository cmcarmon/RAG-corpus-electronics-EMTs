The CALIBRATED label, shown in view A of figure 1-1, has black lettering and a white
background and comes in two sizes. It is the most commonly used label in the METCAL program. This
label indicates that the instrument to which it is attached is within its applicable tolerance on all
parameters. If there are any qualifying conditions for use of the instrument, one of the other labels
described in the next paragraphs should be used.
