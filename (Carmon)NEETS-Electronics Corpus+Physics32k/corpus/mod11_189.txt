The resonant frequency of a magnetron may be changed by varying the inductance or capacitance of 
the resonant cavities. In figure 2-36, an inductive tuning element is inserted into the hole portion of the 
hole-and-slot cavities. It changes the inductance of the resonant circuits by altering the ratio of surface 
area to cavity volume in a high-current region. The type of tuner illustrated in figure 2-36 is called a 
SPROCKET TUNER or CROWN-OF-THORNS TUNER. All of its tuning elements are attached to a 
frame which is positioned by a flexible bellows arrangement. The insertion of the tuning elements into 
each anode hole decreases the inductance of the cavity and therefore increases the resonant frequency. 
One of the limitations of inductive tuning is that it lowers the unloaded Q of the cavities and therefore 
reduces the efficiency of the tube.
