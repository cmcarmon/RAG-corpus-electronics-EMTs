A fast-time-constant (ftc) circuit is a differentiator circuit located at the input of the first video
amplifier. When a large block of video is applied to the ftc circuit, only the leading edge will pass. This is
because of the short time constant of the differentiator. A small target will produce the same length of
signal on the indicator as a large target because only the leading edge is displayed. The ftc circuit has no
effect on receiver gain; and, although it does not eliminate jamming signals, ftc greatly reduces the effect
of jamming.
