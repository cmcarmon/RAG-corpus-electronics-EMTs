Verifying Circuit Theorems with PSpice
In this section, we learn how to use PSpice to verify the theorems cov-
ered in this chapter. Speciﬁcally, we will consider using DC Sweep analy-
sis  to  ﬁnd  the  Thevenin  or  Norton  equivalent  at  any  pair  of  nodes  in  a
circuit and the maximum power transfer to a load. The reader is advised
to read Section D.3 of Appendix D in preparation for this section.
