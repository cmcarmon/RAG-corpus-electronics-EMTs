As other positive displacement pumps the Bush Pump is constructed around a down-hole cylinder containing a piston, that lifts water with every lever stroke. The pump's signifying feature is the hardwood block that acts as a bearing and its lever mechanism. Besides this, the pump has an untraditional construction where the well base is bolted directly to the top of the well casing, sticking out of the bore hole. It extracts water from a depth up of 18 to 100m, and can support a usage up to 250 people.
