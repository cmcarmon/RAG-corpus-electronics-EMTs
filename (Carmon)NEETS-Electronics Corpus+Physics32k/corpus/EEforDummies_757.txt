Set up the circuit, using Figure 11-20 as your guide. Note that one end of 
the SPDT switch is connected to pin 2 (trigger) of the 555 timer, the other 
end is connected to pin 4 (reset) of the 555 timer, and the center terminal is 
connected to ground. Depending on the position of the slider on the SPDT 
switch, the switch either triggers or resets the 555 timer.
