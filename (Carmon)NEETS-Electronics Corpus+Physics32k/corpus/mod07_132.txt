For example at point A the forward-bias voltage is 1 volt and the forward-bias current is 5
milliamperes. This represents 200 ohms of resistance (1 volt/5mA = 200 ohms). However, at point B the
voltage is 3 volts and the current is 50 milliamperes. This results in 60 ohms of resistance for the diode.
Notice that when the forward-bias voltage was tripled (1 volt to 3 volts), the current increased 10 times
(5mA to 50 mA). At the same time the forward-bias voltage increased, the resistance decreased from 200
ohms to 60 ohms. In other words, when forward bias increases, the junction barrier gets smaller and its
resistance to current flow decreases.
