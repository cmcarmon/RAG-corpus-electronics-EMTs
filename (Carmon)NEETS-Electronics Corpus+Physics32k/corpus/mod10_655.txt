A VERTICAL PATTERN view E is obtained from the drawing of the vertical plane view D of the 
radiation pattern view C. The radiation pattern view C is sliced in half along a vertical plane through the 
antenna. This produces the vertical plane pattern in view D. Note how the vertical plane in view D of the 
radiation pattern differs from the horizontal plane in view B. The vertical pattern view E exhibits two 
lobes and two nulls. The difference between the two patterns is caused by two facts: (1) no radiation is
