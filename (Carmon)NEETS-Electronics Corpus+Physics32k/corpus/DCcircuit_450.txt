However, in circuits containing more than one resistor, we must be careful in how we apply
Ohm’s Law. In the three-resistor example circuit below, we know that we have 9 volts between
points 1 and 4, which is the amount of electromotive force trying to push electrons through the
series combination of R1, R2, and R3. However, we cannot take the value of 9 volts and divide
it by 3k, 10k or 5k Ω to try to ﬁnd a current value, because we don’t know how much voltage is
across any one of those resistors, individually.
