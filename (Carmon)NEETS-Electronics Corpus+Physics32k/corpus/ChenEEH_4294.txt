SIP is a new protocol currently under development. The
core SIP application speciﬁed in IETF RFC 2543 is being
implemented and tested in SIP bake-offs. Many extensions of
SIP are being proposed and are under discussion. Holes and
gaps exist for system-level deployment. For example, QoS,
security, services, and operations issues are still being debated.
Interworking mappings of SIP with H.323 and ISUP/BICC are
not yet ﬁnalized (Internet draft status).
