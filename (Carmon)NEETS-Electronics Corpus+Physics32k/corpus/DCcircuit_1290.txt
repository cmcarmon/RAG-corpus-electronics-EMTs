Some of the capacitors shown on this circuit board are standard electrolytic: C30 (top of
board, center) and C36 (left side, 1/3 from the top). Some others are a special kind of electrolytic
capacitor called tantalum, because this is the type of metal used to make the plates. Tantalum
capacitors have relatively high capacitance for their physical size. The following capacitors on
the circuit board shown above are tantalum: C14 (just to the lower-left of C30), C19 (directly
below R10, which is below C30), C24 (lower-left corner of board), and C22 (lower-right).
