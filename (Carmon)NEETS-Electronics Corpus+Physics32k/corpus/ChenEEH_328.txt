Subthreshold Region: MOSFET in Weak Inversion
When the surface potential at the source end is sufﬁcient
to form an inversion layer but the band bending is less than
is needed to reach strong inversion (i.e., fF <
what
Cs < 2fF ), the MOSFET is said to operate in weak inversion.
This region of operation is commonly called the subthreshold
region and plays an important role in determining switching
characteristics of logic circuits. When an n-channel MOSFET
is in weak inversion, the drain current is determined by diffu-
sion of electrons from the source to the drain. This is because
the drift current is negligibly small due to the low lateral
electric ﬁeld and small electron concentration in weak inver-
sion.
