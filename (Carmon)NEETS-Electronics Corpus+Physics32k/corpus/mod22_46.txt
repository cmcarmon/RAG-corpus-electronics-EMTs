As early as 1919, electronics entered the scene. An article by W. H. Eccles and F. W. Jordan 
described an electronic "trigger circuit" that could be used for automatic counting. It was the 
ECCLES-JORDAN multivibrator which was a little ahead of its time because a trigger circuit is one of 
many components required to make an electronic digital computer. Modern digital computers use these 
circuits, known as flip-flops, to store information, perform arithmetic operations, and control the timing 
sequences within the computer.
