Again we obtain an expression identical in form to Equation 14.23, so this too
is a resonant circuit. The difference this time is that the current is the output
variable, so here the current is maximum at resonance, whereas for the parallel
circuit of Figure 14.1, the voltage was maximum. By comparing corresponding
terms in the two derivations, for this series circuit,
