The  four  parameters  in  Fig.  2.15  (rbe,  hre,  b,  and  rce)  are  the  hybrid  parameters  describing  the  transistor
properties, although our notation differs from that commonly used. The parameters in the small-signal equiv-
alent circuit depend on the operating point of the device, which is set by the time-average voltages and currents
(VB E ,  IC ,  etc.)  applied  to  the  device.  All  of  the  parameters  are  readily  measured  for  a  given  transistor  and
operating point, and manufacturers commonly specify ranges for the various parameters for a type of transistor.
