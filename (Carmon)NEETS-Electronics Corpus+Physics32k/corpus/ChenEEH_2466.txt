FIGURE 6.17 Geometry of a Rectangular Microstrip Antenna. It
consists of a rectangular metal patch on a dielectric substrate and is
excited by a voltage source across the metal patch and the bottom
ground plane of the substrate. The microstrip antenna produces
maximum radiation in the broadside direction (u Â¼ 0), with ideally
no radiation along the substrate edges (u Â¼ 90).
