Stability of Solutions
Once a solution to a circuit’s currents and voltages is found, a
fundamental question arises regarding its stability. A solution
may be stable or unstable, and stability is both a local and a
global concept (Hasler and Neirynck, 1986). Local stability
usually refers to the solution that, with sufﬁciently close initial
conditions, remains close to other solutions as time increases.
A stronger concept of stability is asymptotic stability: if initial
conditions are close, the solutions converge toward each other
as time approaches inﬁnity. Although no rate of convergence is
