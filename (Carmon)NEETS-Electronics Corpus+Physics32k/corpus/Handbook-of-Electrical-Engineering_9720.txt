The Internet is the adolescent offspring developed from the creation of a backbone connecting computers
and computer networks. These 
 within internal locations can now be linked to
other  networks  worldwide.  The  Internet,  not  really  a  place  but  a  concept,  is  intended  to  connect  global
information resources. The value of the Internet is more than its ability to link computers and networks, its
real value is in bringing information to any who need it.
