The IMPATT diode relies on avalanche breakdown in the
device to generate an external current. The nonlinear device
provides negative resistance that is a function of the amplitude
of the RF current ï¬‚owing through the device. At higher RF
current amplitude, the negative resistance is depleted, which is
essential for stable operation as an oscillator.
