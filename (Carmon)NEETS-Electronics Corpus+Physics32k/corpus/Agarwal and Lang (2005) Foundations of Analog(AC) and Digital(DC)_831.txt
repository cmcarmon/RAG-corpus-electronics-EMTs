In our earlier example, we had implemented these expressions using several abstract
logic gate elements. Now that we understand how gates are constructed using MOSFETs
and resistors, we can actually construct a single compound combinational logic gate
using MOSFETs and resistors that implements each of these functions.12
Let us consider the first expression: AB + C + D. Using the intuition that switches in
series implement the AND property and switches in parallel implement the OR property,
we can implement the first expression as shown in Figure 6.23. By checking the circuit
against its truth table, we can convince ourselves that the circuit does work as desired.
Figure 6.24 shows the circuit for the second expression: (A + B)CD.
