The  exponential  modeling  characterization  spelled  out  in  this  theorem  is  only  applicable  to  data  that  is
exactly represented by an exponential model. In most practical applications, however, it is found that the data
being analyzed can only be approximately represented by an exponential model of reasonably small order. For
such situations, it is conceptually possible to employ the concept of signal restoration to slightly perturb the
given data set so that the perturbed data set is exactly represented by a qth-order exponential model. To achieve
this objective, we need to introduce signal attributes that facilitate this goal. From Theorem 12, it is apparent
that the ideal data matrix should be contained in the two attribute sets
