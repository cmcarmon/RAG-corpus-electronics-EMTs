into electric energy as in the case of a battery source, and solar energy converted into electric
energy as in the case of a solar-cell source. On the other hand, when current ï¬‚ows in the direction
of voltage drop, it implies that electric energy is transformed into nonelectric energy. Examples
include electric energy converted into thermal energy as in the case of an electric heater, electric
energy transformed into mechanical energy as in the case of motor load, and electric energy
changed into chemical energy as in the case of a charging battery.
