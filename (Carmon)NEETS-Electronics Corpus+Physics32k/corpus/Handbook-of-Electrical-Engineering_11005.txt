The ventricles may become so excitable that they develop a rapid rhythm called ventricular tachycardia, as
shown  in  Fig  113.14(8).  In  this  situation  the  pumping  capability  is  diminished  owing  to  the  high  rate  that
impairs ﬁlling and to impaired coordination of contraction. Ventricular ﬁbrillation is a condition in which all
of  the  ventricular  muscle  ﬁbers  contract  and  relax  independently  and  asynchronously.  Pumping  ceases  and
cardiac output falls to zero. The ECG [Fig. 113.14(9)] exhibits rapid oscillations of waxing and waning amplitude
at a rate of 800 to 1500 per minute. Ventricular ﬁbrillation is lethal unless the circulation is restored within a
few  minutes,  ﬁrst  by  cardiopulmonary  resuscitation  (CPR)  and  then  by  electrical  deﬁbrillation.  The  latter
technique  employs  the  delivery  of  a  substantial  pulse  of  current  through  the  heart  applied  directly  or  with
transchest  electrodes.  Figure 113.15  illustrates  ventricular  tachycardia  (left),  ventricular  ﬁbrillation  (center),
and deﬁbrillation (right), with the restoration of pumping.
