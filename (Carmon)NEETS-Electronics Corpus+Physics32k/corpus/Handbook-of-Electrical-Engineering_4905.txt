If we prevent the Cooper pairs from forming by ensuring that all the electrons are at an energy greater than
the binding energy, we can destroy the superconducting phenomenon. This can be accomplished, for example,
,  associated  with  this
with  thermal  energy.  In  fact,  according  to  the  BCS  theory,  the  critical  temperature, 
c
energy is
