Battenburg markings were originally developed in the mid-1990s in the United Kingdom by the Police Scientific Development Branch (PSDB) (now the Home Office Centre for Applied Science and Technology (CAST)) at the request of the national motorway policing sub-committee of the Association of Chief Police Officers. They were first developed for the United Kingdom police forces to use on traffic patrol cars, although other private organisations and civil emergency services have since started to use the pattern on their vehicles.
The brief was to create a livery for motorway and trunk road police vehicles which would maximise the visibility of the vehicles when stopped on scene, both in daylight, and under headlights from a minimum distance of 500 metres (1,600 ft), and which would distinctively mark them as police vehicles.
The key research objectives included:
Enhance officer and vehicle conspicuity to reduce the likelihood of road accidents in which a vehicle is not noticed.
Recognisable as a police vehicle to a distance of 500 metres (1,600 ft) in daylight.
Assist in high-visibility policing for public reassurance and deterrence of traffic violations.
Identifiable nationally as a police vehicle.
A cost-neutral option compared with the average cost of the current markings.
Acceptable to at least 75% of the staff.
