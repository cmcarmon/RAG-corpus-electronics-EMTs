A subtle, but very important, aspect of the Fourier spectrum is its uniqueness: You can unambiguously
ﬁnd the spectrum from the signal (decomposition (4.15)) and the signal from the spectrum (composition).
Thus, any aspect of the signal can be found from the spectrum and vice versa. A signal’s frequency
domain expression is its spectrum. A periodic signal can be deﬁned either in the time domain (as a
function) or in the frequency domain (as a spectrum).
