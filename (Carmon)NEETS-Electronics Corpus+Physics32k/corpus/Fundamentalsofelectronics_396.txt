is has no eﬀect: Whatever you pick for a value has no practical relevance for either the signal’s spectrum or
for how a system responds to the signal. The Fourier series value “at” the discontinuity is the average of the
values on either side of the jump.
4.6 Encoding Information in the Frequency Domain11
To emphasize the fact that every periodic signal has both a time and frequency domain representation, we
can exploit both to encode information into a signal. Refer to the Fundamental Model of Communication
(Figure 1.3). We have an information source, and want to construct a transmitter that produces a signal
x (t). For the source, let’s assume we have information to encode every T seconds. For example, we want
to represent typed letters produced by an extremely good typist (a key is struck every T seconds). Let’s
consider the Fourier series formula in the light of trying to encode information.
