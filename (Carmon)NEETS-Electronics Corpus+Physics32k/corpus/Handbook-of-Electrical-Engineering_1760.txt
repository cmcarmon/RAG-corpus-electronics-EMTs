After the processing is complete, a video signal is ready for transmission over some channel or storage on
some  medium.  If  the  signal  is  transmitted,  the  type  of  channel  will  vary  depending  on  the  application.  For
example, today analog television signals are transmitted one of three ways: via satellite, terrestrially, or by cable.
All  three  channels  have  limited  transmission  bandwidths  and  can  adversely  affect  the  signals  because  of  the
imperfect frequency responses of the channels. Alternatively, with a digital channel, the primary limitation will
be the bandwidth.
