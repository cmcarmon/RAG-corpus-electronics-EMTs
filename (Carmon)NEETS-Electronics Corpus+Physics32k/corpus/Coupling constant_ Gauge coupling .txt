In a non-Abelian gauge theory, the gauge coupling parameter,

{\displaystyle g}
, appears in the Lagrangian as

{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4g^{2}}}{\rm {Tr}}\,G_{\mu \nu }G^{\mu \nu }}

(where



G


{\displaystyle G}
is the gauge field tensor) in some conventions. In another widely used convention,



G


{\displaystyle G}
is rescaled so that the coefficient of the kinetic term is 1/4 and



g


{\displaystyle g}
appears in the covariant derivative. This should be understood to be similar to a dimensionless version of the elementary charge defined as
