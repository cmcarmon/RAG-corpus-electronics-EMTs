Research on compilation tools for run-time reconﬁgurable
systems, based on the dbC language, is described by Gokhale
and Marks (1995). These tools target the National Semicon-
ductor CLAy FPGA (National Semiconductor, 1993) and pro-
vide a path for high-level design compilation. Weinhardt and
Luk (2001) have extended vectorization and loop transform-
ation techniques used in super-computers for reconﬁgurable
design; Figure 3.4 summarizes the key steps in this framework.
