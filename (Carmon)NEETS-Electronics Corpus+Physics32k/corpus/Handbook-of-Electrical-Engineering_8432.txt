Although the sign-magnitude system is used in computers, it has two drawbacks. There is no unique zero,
as  indicated  by  the  examples,  and  addition  and  subtraction  calculations  require  time-consuming  decisions
regarding operation and sign as, for example, (–7) minus (–4). Even so, the sign-magnitude representation is
commonly used in ﬂoating-point number systems.
