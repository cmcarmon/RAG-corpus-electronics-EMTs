History
As early as 1962 in the United States [Bassett and Becker, 1963], and even earlier—1957—in Japan [Fukada
and Yasuda,  1957]  it  was  shown  that  electric  potential  differences  appear  across  both  living  and  dead  bone
subjected to mechanical stress. Bassett and Becker observed that these stress-generated electrical signals decayed
very slowly in comparison with similarly initiated signals in piezoelectric crystals and concluded [Bassett and
Becker, 1963] that piezoelectric phenomena “while probably present, were not the sole cause of these potentials.”
Later analysis and experiments established that the observed signals were primarily due to ion displacement
within the porous regions and multiple ﬂuid-ﬁlled channels present in all bone. The early observations already
suggested that direct application of an externally generated voltage might have an effect on bone development.
This  was  shown  to  be  the  case  by  Bassett  et al. [1964]  who  found  that  a  dc  current  of  the  order  of  1  mA
(corresponding  to  a  current  density  of  approximately  0.01  A/m2 )  produced  massive  osteogenesis  near  the
cathode when electrodes were implanted into the femur of living dogs.
