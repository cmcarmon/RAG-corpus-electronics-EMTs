Impedance Transformers
Impedance transformers are used to interface two sections of line with different characteristic impedances.
The smoothest transition and the one with the broadest bandwidth is a tapered line as shown in Fig. 39.3(a)
and (e). This element tends to be very long and so step terminations called quarter-wave impedance transformers
[see  Fig.  39.4(h)  and  (i)]  are  sometimes  used  although  their  bandwidth  is  relatively  small  centered  on  the
frequency at which l = l
