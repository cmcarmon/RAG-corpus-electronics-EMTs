In Subsection 2.5.2, we will also use our tools to create Pareto
curves visualizing the useful trade-off space between the cycle
budget assigned to a given system submodule and its corres-
ponding energy and/or area consumption (i.e., involving three
search space axes). As far as we know, no other systematic (auto-
matable) approach is available in literature to solve this import-
ant design problem. These curves can then be used to optimize
the trade-offs between different system components at the global
system level (see Subsection 2.5.3). These trade-offs are illus-
trated with real-life demonstrators. Prior to this, in Subsection
2.5.1, we will show how different cycle budgets assigned for the
data transfer and storage requirements allow to (signiﬁcantly)
modify the required energy both in fully customizable processors
and in predeﬁned instruction-set processor contexts.
