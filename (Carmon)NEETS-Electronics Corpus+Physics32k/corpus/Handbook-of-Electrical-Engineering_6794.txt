With this architecture, when a customer places a Calling Card call, the call is routed to an operator services
system  (OSS)  which  suspends  call  processing  and  launches  a  query  through  a  CCS7  signaling  network.  The
query is delivered to an SCP which contains the line information database (LIDB) application software. The
LIDB application can provide routing information, such as identifying the customer-speciÔ¨Åed carrier which is
to handle the call, as well as provide screening functions, such as the Calling Card validation used to authorize
a call. The LIDB then returns the appropriate information to the OSS so that the call can be completed. The
LIDBs are supported by the database administration system (DBAS), which is an operations support system
that processes updates for Calling Card Service as well as other services. Multiple DBAS systems typically support
each LIDB.
