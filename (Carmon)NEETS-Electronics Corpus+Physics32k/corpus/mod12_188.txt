During the first 1/8 of a second (T1 to T2), the carrier wave completes exactly 1 cycle, or 360 
degrees, as shown in view (C). The upper sideband, which has a frequency of 9 hertz, will complete each 
cycle in less than 1/8 of a second. Therefore, during the time required for the carrier to complete 1 cycle 
of 360 degrees, the upper sideband [view (B)] is able to complete 1 cycle of 360 degrees plus an 
additional 45 degrees of the next cycle, for a total of 405 degrees.
