FIGURE 5.17 Exploiting Parallelism. (A) This Ô¨Ågure shows a path with modules supplied from a high Vdd; the path length is T (C). Reducing
the supply voltage causes the path to produce the output after 2T seconds (D). Duplicating the modules with the lower Vdd (B) causes the
parallel structure to produce two outputs every 2T seconds, which is equivalent to one output every T seconds (E).
