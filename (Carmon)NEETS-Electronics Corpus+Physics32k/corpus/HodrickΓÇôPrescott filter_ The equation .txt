The reasoning for the methodology uses ideas related to the decomposition of time series. Let




y

t





{\displaystyle y_{t}\,}
for



t

2
,

,
T



{\displaystyle t=1,2,...,T\,}
denote the logarithms of a time series variable. The series




y

t





{\displaystyle y_{t}\,}
is made up of a trend component, denoted by




τ

t





{\displaystyle \tau _{t}\,}
a cyclical component, denoted by




c

t





{\displaystyle c_{t}\,}
, and an error component, denoted by




ϵ

t





{\displaystyle \epsilon _{t}\,}
such that




y

t



=

τ

t



+

c

t



+

ϵ

t





{\displaystyle y_{t}\ =\tau _{t}\ +c_{t}\ +\epsilon _{t}\,}
. Given an adequately chosen, positive value of



λ


{\displaystyle \lambda }
, there is a trend component that will solve

{\displaystyle \min _{\tau }\left(\sum _{t=1}^{T}{(y_{t}-\tau _{t})^{2}}+\lambda \sum _{t=2}^{T-1}{[(\tau _{t+1}-\tau _{t})-(\tau _{t}-\tau _{t-1})]^{2}}\right).\,}

The first term of the equation is the sum of the squared deviations




d

t


=

y

t


−

τ

t




{\displaystyle d_{t}=y_{t}-\tau _{t}}
which penalizes the cyclical component. The second term is a multiple



λ


{\displaystyle \lambda }
of the sum of the squares of the trend component's second differences. This second term penalizes variations in the growth rate of the trend component. The larger the value of



λ


{\displaystyle \lambda }
, the higher is the penalty. Hodrick and Prescott suggest 1600 as a value for



λ


{\displaystyle \lambda }
for quarterly data. Ravn and Uhlig (2002) state that



λ


{\displaystyle \lambda }
should vary by the fourth power of the frequency observation ratio; thus,



λ


{\displaystyle \lambda }
should equal 6.25 for annual data and 129,600 for monthly data.
