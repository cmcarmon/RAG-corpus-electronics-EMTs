Sometimes the phrases alpha test and beta test are used as a linked pair of related terms. Alpha testing deﬁnes
the set of tests run by a development organization prior to release to early customers. Beta testing deﬁnes the
set of tests and actual usage experiences of a small group of early customers. Unfortunately the term alpha test
is  so  ambiguous  that  it  is  not  possible  to  assign  a  defect  removal  efﬁciency  rating.  Beta  testing  is  better
understood, and the observed removal efﬁciency is usually in the 25% range.
