In some radar applications, moving targetsâ€™ signals are embed-
ded in strong stationary clutter. Moving targets will produce a
Doppler frequency shift, while the stationary clutter has very
small spectral spreading around zero frequency. The moving
target indicator (MTI) radar is a pulsed radar that uses the
Doppler frequency shift as a means for discriminating moving
targets from stationary clutter.
