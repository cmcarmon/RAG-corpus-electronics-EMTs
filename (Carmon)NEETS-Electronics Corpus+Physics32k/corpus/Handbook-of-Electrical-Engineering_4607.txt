If an electric charge is moved with a velocity at some angle to a magnetic ﬁeld, the charge will experience a
force at right angles to both the charge velocity and the magnetic ﬁeld. If the charge is inside a solid material,
, which ﬁnds
a charge inhomogeneity is created and an electric ﬁeld results. This is the well-known 
practical  application  in  such  devices  as  magnetic  ﬁeld  meters  and  in  more  basic  uses  as  measuring  and
understanding the properties of semiconductors.
