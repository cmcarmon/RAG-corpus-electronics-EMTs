When dealing with a parallel ac circuit, you will find that the concepts presented in this chapter for 
series ac circuits still apply. There is one major difference between a series circuit and a parallel circuit 
that must be considered. The difference is that current is the same in all parts of a series circuit, whereas 
voltage is the same across all branches of a parallel circuit. Because of this difference, the total impedance 
of a parallel circuit must be computed on the basis of the current in the circuit.
