Because of its electrical topology (single conductor), a struc-
ture cannot support a static electric ﬁeld, so it will not support
TEM modes. The modes supported are TM. As mentioned
earlier for these modes, either the electric or the magnetic ﬁeld
is zero along the direction of propagation (z direction in the
ﬁgure). Starting from Maxwell’s equations and imposing
the proper boundary conditions for the ﬁeld components
on the four sides of the rectangular waveguide (Balanis,
1989), it is possible to derive the exact ﬁeld expressions for
all the ﬁeld components in the guide. The reason there are
more possible modes in a rectangular section waveguide
(TEmnTMmn) is because imposing boundary conditions on
the waveguide walls produce multiple solutions due to the
periodicity of the trigonometric functions in which the ﬁelds
are expressed:
