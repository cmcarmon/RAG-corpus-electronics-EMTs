Since frequency affects capacitive reactance and inductive reactance in opposite ways, and since it is
the capacitive reactance that causes the problem with high-frequency response, inductors are added to an
amplifier circuit to improve the high-frequency response. This is called HIGH-FREQUENCY
COMPENSATION. Inductors (coils), when used for high-frequency compensation, are called PEAKING
COILS. Peaking coils can be added to a circuit so they are in series with the output signal path or in
parallel to the output signal path. Instead of only in series or parallel, a combination of peaking coils in
series and parallel with the output signal path can also be used for high-frequency compensation.
