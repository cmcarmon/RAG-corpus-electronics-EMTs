The low-value resistors are represented by thick-line symbols, and the wires connecting
them to the voltage source (carrying high current) are likewise drawn thickly in the schematic.
This oddly-conﬁgured bridge is perhaps best understood by beginning with a standard Wheat-
stone bridge set up for measuring low resistance, and evolving it step-by-step into its ﬁnal form
in an effort to overcome certain problems encountered in the standard Wheatstone conﬁgura-
tion.
