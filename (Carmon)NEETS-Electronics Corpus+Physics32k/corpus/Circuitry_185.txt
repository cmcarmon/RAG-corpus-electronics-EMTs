Waveforms and signals 
 
A graph showing the variation of voltage or current 
present in a circuit is known as a waveform. There 
are many common types of waveform encountered 
in electrical circuits including sine (or sinusoidal), 
square,  triangle,  ramp  or  sawtooth  (which  may  be 
either positive or negative going), and pulse. 
  Complex  waveforms,
like  speech  and  music, 
usually  comprise  many  components  at  different 
frequencies.  Pulse  waveforms 
are  often 
categorized  as  either  repetitive  or  non-repetitive 
(the  former  comprises  a  pattern  of  pulses  that
