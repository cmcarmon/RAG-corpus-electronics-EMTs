AC’s alternating nature has a greater tendency to throw the heart’s pacemaker neurons into
a condition of ﬁbrillation, whereas DC tends to just make the heart stand still. Once the shock
current is halted, a ”frozen” heart has a better chance of regaining a normal beat pattern than
a ﬁbrillating heart. This is why ”deﬁbrillating” equipment used by emergency medics works:
the jolt of current supplied by the deﬁbrillator unit is DC, which halts ﬁbrillation and gives the
heart a chance to recover.
