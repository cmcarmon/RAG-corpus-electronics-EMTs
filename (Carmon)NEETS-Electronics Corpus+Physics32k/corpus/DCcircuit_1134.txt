When dealing with secondary-cell batteries, particular attention must be paid to the method
and timing of charging. Different types and construction of batteries have different charging
needs, and the manufacturer’s recommendations are probably the best guide to follow when
designing or maintaining a system. Two distinct concerns of battery charging are cycling and
overcharging. Cycling refers to the process of charging a battery to a ”full” condition and
then discharging it to a lower state. All batteries have a ﬁnite (limited) cycle life, and the
allowable ”depth” of cycle (how far it should be discharged at any time) varies from design to
design. Overcharging is the condition where current continues to be forced backwards through
a secondary cell beyond the point where the cell has reached full charge. With lead-acid cells
in particular, overcharging leads to electrolysis of the water (”boiling” the water out of the
battery) and shortened life.
