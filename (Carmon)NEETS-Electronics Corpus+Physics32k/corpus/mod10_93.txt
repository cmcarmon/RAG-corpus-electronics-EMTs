In the study of physics, sound is defined as a range of compression-wave frequencies to which the
human ear is sensitive. For the purpose of this chapter, however, we need to broaden the definition of
sound to include compression waves that are not always audible to the human ear. To distinguish
frequencies in the audible range from those outside that range, the words SONIC, ULTRASONIC, and
INFRASONIC are used. Sounds capable of being heard by the human ear are called SONICS. The normal
hearing range extends from about 20 to 20,000 hertz. However, to establish a standard sonic range, the
Navy has set an arbitrary upper limit for sonics at 10,000 hertz and a lower limit at 15 hertz. Even though
the average person can hear sounds above 10,000 hertz, it is standard practice to refer to sounds above
that frequency as ultrasonic. Sounds between 15 hertz and 10,000 hertz are called sonic, while sounds
below 15 hertz are known as infrasonic (formerly referred to as subsonic) sounds.
