The second Feigenbaum constant (sequence A006891 in the OEIS),
α = 2.502907875095892822283902873218…,
is the ratio between the width of a tine and the width of one of its two subtines (except the tine closest to the fold). A negative sign is applied to α when the ratio between the lower subtine and the width of the tine is measured.
These numbers apply to a large class of dynamical systems (for example, dripping faucets to population growth).
