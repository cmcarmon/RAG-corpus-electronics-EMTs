Rheopectic fluids are a rare class of non-Newtonian fluids. These show a time-dependent increase in viscosity; the longer the fluid undergoes shearing force, the higher its viscosity. Rheopectic fluids, such as some lubricants, thicken or solidify when shaken. Examples of rheopectic fluids include gypsum pastes and printer inks.
