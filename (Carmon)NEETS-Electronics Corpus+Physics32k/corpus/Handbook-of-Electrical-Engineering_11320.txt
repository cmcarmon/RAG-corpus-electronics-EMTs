Battery
The design for an ICD battery has many stringent requirements and presents a unique challenge to the engineer.
While the pacemaker battery is optimized for high energy density, a deﬁbrillator battery must sacriﬁce some
energy  density  for  high  current  capability.  An  average  deﬁbrillator  battery  must  be  able  to  supply  a  steady
background current of 10 to 20 µA for at least 5 years for monitoring and pacing functions, as well as, provide
around 200, 2-A pulses for 10 to 15 seconds each in order to charge the capacitors for multiple deﬁbrillation
shocks [Holmes, 1996]. All of these criteria must be met while minimizing the size of the battery and maximizing
its safety and reliability. In addition, it is necessary to be able to reliably predict the end of life of the battery.
Nearly all modern ICDs use lithium silver vanadium oxide battery technology to accomplish these requirements
[Liang et al., 1982]. Lithium pressed into a nickel current collector serves as the anode, and silver vanadium
oxide serves as the active cathode. The electrolyte is generally a lithium salt dissolved in a mixed organic solvent.
This produces approximately 3.2 V, but two cells are often connected in series to give around 6 V. Some newer
systems  are  using  single  battery  technology.  A  large  electrode  surface  area  and  low  internal  impedance  are
required to achieve the high current pulses [Holmes, 1996]. This is accomplished by folding the anode in an
accordion-like fashion and placing cathode plates in the folds. A disadvantage of this battery is that it exhibits
a phenomenon in its mid-life known as voltage delay, in which the voltage goes low in the ﬁrst second or two
during a charging pulse. This can cause a prolongation of the capacitor charging time, which can be dangerous
to the patient. It is due to an initial high resistance caused by a chemical buildup on the cathode in the cell
