It should be understood that polarity has nothing to do with Ohm’s Law: there will never
be negative voltages, currents, or resistance entered into any Ohm’s Law equations! There are
other mathematical principles of electricity that do take polarity into account through the use
of signs (+ or -), but not Ohm’s Law.
