electronic components are combined into high-density modules. Integrated circuits are made up of active
and passive components, such as transistors, diodes, resistors, and capacitors. Because of their reduced
size, use of integrated circuits can simplify otherwise complex systems by reducing the number of
separate components and interconnections. Their use can also reduce power consumption, reduce the
overall size of the equipment, and significantly lower the overall cost of the equipment concerned. Many
types of integrated circuits are ESDS devices and should be handled accordingly.
