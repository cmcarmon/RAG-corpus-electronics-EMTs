A rotating armature requires slip rings and brushes to conduct the current from the armature to the
load. The armature, brushes, and slip rings are difficult to insulate, and arc-overs and short circuits can
result at high voltages. For this reason, high-voltage alternators are usually of the rotating-field type.
Since the voltage applied to the rotating field is low voltage dc, the problem of high voltage arc-over at
the slip rings does not exist.
