Steady-State Stability
The property of a power system that ensures that it will remain in equilibrium under both normal
and abnormal conditions is known as power-system stability. Steady-state stability is concerned
with slow and gradual changes, whereas transient stability is concerned with severe disturbances,
such as sudden changes in load or fault conditions. The largest possible ï¬‚ow of power through
a particular point, without loss of stability, is known as the steady-state stability limit when
the power is increased gradually, and as the transient-stability limit when a sudden disturbance
occurs.
