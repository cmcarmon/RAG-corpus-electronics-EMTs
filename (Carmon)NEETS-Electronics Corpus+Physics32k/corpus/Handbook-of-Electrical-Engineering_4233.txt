In phased array radars, the thermodynamic temperature of the antenna receive beam-former may be signif-
icantly  higher  than  ambient,  so  a  more  complete  analysis  is  required.  The  antenna  noise  temperature  is
determined  by  the  external  noise  received  by  the  antenna  from  solar,  atmospheric,  earth  surface,  and  other
sources.
