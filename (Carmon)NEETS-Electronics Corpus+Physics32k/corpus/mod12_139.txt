CARBON MICROPHONE.â€”Operation of the SINGLE-BUTTON CARBON MICROPHONE 
figure 1-33, view (A) is based on varying the resistance of a pile of carbon granules located within the 
microphone. An insulated cup, referred to as the button, holds the loosely piled granules. It is so mounted 
that it is in constant contact with the thin metal diaphragm. Sound waves striking the diaphragm vary the 
pressure on the button which varies the pressure on the pile of carbon granules. The dc resistance of the 
carbon granule pile is varied by this pressure. This varying resistance is in series with a battery and the
