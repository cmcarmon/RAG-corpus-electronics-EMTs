This  chapter  introduces  electronic  circuits  and 
devices that are associated  with digital rather than 
analogue  circuitry.  These  logic  circuits  are  used 
extensively in digital systems and form the basis of 
clocks, counters, shift registers and timers.  
  The chapter starts by introducing the basic logic 
functions (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, etc.) together 
with the symbols and truth tables that describe the 
operation of the most common logic gates. We then 
show  how  these  gates  can  be  used  in  simple 
combinational  logic  circuits  before  moving  on  to 
introduce  bistable  devices,  counters  and  shift 
registers.  The  chapter  concludes  with  a  brief 
introduction to the two principal technologies used 
in modern digital logic circuits, TTL and CMOS.
