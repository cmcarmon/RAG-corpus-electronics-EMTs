Some Topological Applications in Network Analysis and Design
In practice a circuit designer often has to make approximations and analyze the same network structure many
times with different sets of component values before the ﬁnal network realization is obtained. Conventional
analysis techniques which require the evaluation of high-order determinants are undesirable even on a digital
computer because of the large amount of redundancy inherent in the determinant expansion process. The extra
calculation  in  the  evaluation  (expansion  of  determinants)  and  simpliﬁcation  (cancellation  of  terms)  is  time
consuming and costly and thereby contributes much to the undesirability of such methods.
