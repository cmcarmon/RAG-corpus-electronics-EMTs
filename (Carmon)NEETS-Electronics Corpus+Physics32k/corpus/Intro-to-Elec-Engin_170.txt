STEP 5: Obtain the desired voltages and currents by the application of KVL and Ohm’s law. To
ﬁnd the current I in the 10-V source, since it does not appear in Figure E2.2.1(b) redrawn for
nodal analysis, one has to go back to the original circuit and identify the equivalence between
nodes A and O, as shown in Figure E2.2.1(c).
