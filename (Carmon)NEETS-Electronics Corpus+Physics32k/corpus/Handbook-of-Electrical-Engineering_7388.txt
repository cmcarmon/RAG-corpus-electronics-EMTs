Power Plants
In power plants, coal is fed in turn to a number of hoppers by conveyor belt. A tripper on the conveyor belt diverts
the  coal  into  a  particular  hopper  until  it  is  full.  Either  an  operator  or  a  mechanical  sensing  device  determines
when  the  hopper  is  full,  and  a  signal  is  transmitted  to  the  conveyor  to  move  onto  the  next  hopper.  Before
telemetering equipment was in use, costly accidents could occur if the operator should be away momentarily or
if the sensor failed to function. As much as six tons of coal a minute could overﬂow onto the power station ﬂoor.
To  prevent  this,  pressure  switches  are  installed  in  the  tripper  chute  to  activate  a  radio  transmitter  if  coal
backs up into the tripper. The transmitter sends its signal to a receiver located at the conveyor belt and sounds
an alarm. This type of control is difﬁcult if not impossible to achieve by wired power connections because the
tripper is moving and because the corrosive coal dust atmosphere attacks the wires. For this reason, a radio
transmitter  equipped  with  long-life  batteries  is  mounted  on  the  tripper.  The  receiver  at  the  control  end  is
powered by ac. Subcarrier tone (frequency) coding is used to eliminate the effects of interference and noise,
giving positive protection at all times.
