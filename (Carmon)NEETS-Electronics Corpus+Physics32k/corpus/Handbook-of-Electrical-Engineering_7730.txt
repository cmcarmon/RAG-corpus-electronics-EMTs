I/O  system  parameters  as  a  function  of  application.  Transaction  processing  applications  are  seek  and
rotational latency limited, since only small blocks are usually transferred from disk. Image-processing applications, on the
other hand, transfer huge blocks and thus spend most of their I/O time in data transfer. Scientiﬁc computing applications
tend to fall in between. (Source: I. Y. Bucher and A. H. Hayes, “I/O performance measurement on Cray-1 and CDC 7600
