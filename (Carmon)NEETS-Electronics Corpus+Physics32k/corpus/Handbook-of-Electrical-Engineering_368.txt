Tellegen’s theorem: Two networks, here including all sources, are topologically equivalent if they are similar
structurally, component by component. Tellegen’s theorem states that the sum over all products of the
product of the current of a component of ne network, network a, and of the voltage of the corresponding
component of the other network, network b, is zero. This would be expressed as Sall j vbj iaj = 0. From this
general relationship it follows that in any electrical network, the sum of the power supplied by the sources
is equal to the sum of the power delivered to all the nonsource components.
