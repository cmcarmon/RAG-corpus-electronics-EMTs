p r o b l e m 14.8 Communications receivers require high-Q circuits to separate
signals broadcast on adjacent channels. Due to losses, modeled by the parallel resistance
r, there is a limit to the Q that can be achieved with passive components. In the amplifier
circuit in Figure 14.62, a variable resistor RF has been added which has the effect of
increasing the Q of the passive tuned circuit.
