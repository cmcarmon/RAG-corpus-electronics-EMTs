Ohm’s law by itself is not sufﬁcient to analyze circuits. However, when
it is coupled with Kirchhoff’s two laws, we have a sufﬁcient, powerful
set of tools for analyzing a large variety of electric circuits. Kirchhoff’s
laws  were  ﬁrst  introduced  in  1847  by  the  German  physicist  Gustav
Robert  Kirchhoff  (1824–1887).  These  laws  are  formally  known  as
Kirchhoff’s current law (KCL) and Kirchhoff’s voltage law (KVL).
