Other Methods
Note that after discretization, the inverse scattering problem
can be cast into a multivariable nonlinear problem. There
exist, of course, miscellaneous methods for solving this prob-
lem. Apart from those mentioned previously, other available
methods include genetic algorithm and simulated annealing.
