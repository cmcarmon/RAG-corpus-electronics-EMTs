The principal steady-state operating characteristics are the interrelations among terminal
voltage, ﬁeld current, armature current, real power, reactive power, torque angle, power factor,
and efﬁciency. These characteristics can be computed for application studies by means of phasor
diagrams, such as those shown in Figure 13.3.2, corresponding to various conditions of operation.
The efﬁciency of a synchronous generator at a speciﬁed power output and power factor is
determined by the ratio of the output to the input; the input power is given by adding the machine
losses to the power output. The efﬁciency is conventionally computed in accordance with a set
of rules agreed upon by ANSI. Six losses are included in the computation:
