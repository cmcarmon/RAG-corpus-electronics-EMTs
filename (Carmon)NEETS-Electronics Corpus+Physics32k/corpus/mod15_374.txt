A fluid surrounds the gyro sphere and provides flotation. It also provides protection from shock, and 
damps the oscillations resulting from sudden changes in the angular rate input. In this gyro, the inner 
gimbal displacement must be measured with some type of electrical pickoff. As the gyro case is rotated 
about the input axis, clockwise or counterclockwise, a precession torque will be developed about the
