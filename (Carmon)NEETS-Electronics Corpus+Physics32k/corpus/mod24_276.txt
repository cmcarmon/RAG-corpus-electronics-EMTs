In most applications, the standard multimode and step-index single mode optical fibers mentioned
before have significant performance advantages over conventional copper-based systems. However,
performance requirements and cost restraints may prohibit the use of these fibers in certain applications.
Fiber manufacturers modify standard multimode and single mode fiber material composition and
structural design to meet these additional requirements. Optical fiber design can depart from a traditional
circular core and cladding, low-loss glass design. The intent of each change is to increase performance
and reduce cost.
