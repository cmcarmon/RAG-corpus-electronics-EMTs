MOSFET chips generally utilize either a p-channel or an n-channel device; hence, these
chips are known as PMOS and NMOS, respectively. Alternatively, both p-channel and n-channel
devices are used to form compound devices, in which case they are known as complementary
MOS (CMOS). Whereas the CMOS has the advantage of low power consumption, only a smaller
number of devices can be placed on the chip. MOS technologies are popularly used in computer
circuits due to their higher packing densities. Bipolar technologies, however, are used in high-
speed applications because they respond more quickly. The device fabrication methods are too
involved to be presented in this introductory text.
