low-pass ﬁlter can only approximate the
ideal
low-pass response. In practice, ﬁlters have passband
magnitude within a tolerance of unity and have stop-
band magnitude within a tolerance of zero. When practical
ﬁlters are speciﬁed, transition bands are allowed between
adjacent passbands and stopbands so that the magnitude
response in the transition bands may swing between the
allowed passband and stopband magnitudes. The impulse
response h[n] of a practical ﬁlter can vary depending on
given ﬁlter speciﬁcations. The task of determining h[n] to
satisfy the speciﬁcations is called ﬁlter design.
