Soon after the Pluto flyby, New Horizons reported that the spacecraft was healthy, its flight path was within the margins, and science data of the Pluto–Charon system had been recorded. The spacecraft's immediate task was to begin returning the 6.25 gigabytes of information collected. The free space path loss at its distance of 4.5 light-hours (3,017,768,400 km) is approximately 303 dB at 7 GHz. Using the high gain antenna and transmitting at full power, New Horizons' EIRP is +83 dBm, and at this distance the signal reaching Earth is −220 dBm. The received signal level (RSL) using one, un-arrayed Deep Space Network antenna with 72 dBi of forward gain equals −148 dBm. Because of the extremely low RSL, it could only transmit data at 1 to 2 kb/s.
By March 30, 2016, New Horizons had reached the halfway point of transmitting this data. The transfer was completed on October 25, 2016 at 21:48 UTC, when the last piece of data—part of a Pluto–Charon observation sequence by the Ralph/LEISA imager—was received by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.
At a distance of 40.40 AU (6.04 billion km; 3.76 billion mi) from the Sun and 2.96 AU (443 million km; 275 million mi) from 2014 MU69 as of January 2017, New Horizons is heading in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius at 14.20 km/s (8.82 mi/s; 3.00 AU/a) relative to the Sun. The brightness of the Sun from the spacecraft is magnitude −18.7.
