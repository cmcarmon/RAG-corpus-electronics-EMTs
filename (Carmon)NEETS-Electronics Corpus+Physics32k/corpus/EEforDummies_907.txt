Solderless breadboards
A solderless breadboard is similar, in a way, to a LEGO table: Itâ€™s a surface on 
which you can build temporary circuits simply by plugging components into 
holes arranged in rows and columns across the board. You can easily take 
one circuit apart and build another different circuit on the same surface.
