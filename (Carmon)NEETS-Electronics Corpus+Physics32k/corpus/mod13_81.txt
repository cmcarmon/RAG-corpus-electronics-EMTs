Table 1-2 provides a comparison of decimal and binary numbers. Notice that each time the total
number of binary symbol positions increase, the binary number indicates the next higher power of 2. By
this example, you can also see that more symbol positions are needed in the binary system to represent the
equivalent value in the decimal system.
