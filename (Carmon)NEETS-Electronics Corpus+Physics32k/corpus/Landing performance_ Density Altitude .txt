A decrease in density of air results in decrease in both aircraft and Engine performance. High elevation airports are characterized by low pressure and high ambient temperatures. The True Airspeed (TAS) will be higher than the Indicated airspeed indicated by the Airspeed indicator to the pilot in air of low density. This increase in TAS leads to greater touchdown speed hence increases the landing roll. More energy has to be absorbed by the brakes thus demanding the need of a longer runway. An increased density altitude means a longer landing distance.
