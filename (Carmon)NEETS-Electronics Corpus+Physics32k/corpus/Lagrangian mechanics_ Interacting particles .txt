For a given system, if two subsystems A and B are non-interacting, the Lagrangian L of the overall system is the sum of the Lagrangians LA and LB for the subsystems:




L
=

L

A


+

L

B



.


{\displaystyle L=L_{A}+L_{B}\,.}

If they do interact this is not possible. In some situations, it may be possible to separate the Lagrangian of the system L into the sum of non-interacting Lagrangians, plus another Lagrangian LAB containing information about the interaction,




L
=

L

A


+

L

B


+

L

A
B



.


{\displaystyle L=L_{A}+L_{B}+L_{AB}\,.}

This may be physically motivated by taking the non-interacting Lagrangians to be kinetic energies only, while the interaction Lagrangian is the system's total potential energy. Also, in the limiting case of negligible interaction, LAB tends to zero reducing to the non-interacting case above.
The extension to more than two non-interacting subsystems is straightforwards â€“ the overall Lagrangian is the sum of the separate Lagrangians for each subsystem. If there are interactions, then interaction Lagrangians may be added.
