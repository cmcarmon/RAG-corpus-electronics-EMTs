Figure  13.19  shows  the  distribution  of  current 
and voltage along the length of a half-wave dipole 
aerial.  The  current  is  maximum  at  the  centre  and 
zero at the ends. The voltage is zero at the centre 
and  maximum  at  the  ends.  This  implies  that  the 
impedance is not constant along the length of aerial
