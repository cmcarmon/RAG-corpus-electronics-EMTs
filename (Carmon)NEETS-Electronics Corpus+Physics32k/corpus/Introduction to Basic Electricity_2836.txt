Transformers are wound with tapped secondar-
ies (Figure 27-2). A center-tapped	secondary is 
the equivalent of two secondary windings, each with 
half of the total voltage across them. The center tap 
is used for power supply to convert AC voltages to 
DC voltages. A transformer may have taps on the 
primary to compensate for line voltages that are too 
high or too low.
