In general, the indication of the power reserve is sometimes represented through a needle or hand or it may be indicted by a revolving wheel viewed through an aperture. Some more modern devices have linear indicators. In the case of a hand indicator, the needle or hand moves from one point of the indicator to another. The zone along which the needle moves, shows how much time is left until the mechanism would be expected to cease autonomous operation. Correspondingly, when the hand leaves the zone (or stops) the watch needs to be wound. The indicator itself represents the amount of tension of the mainspring, thus the lower the tension the less time left until another winding of the watch is required.
