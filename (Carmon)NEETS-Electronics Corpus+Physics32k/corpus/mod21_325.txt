The Hay bridge, shown in figure 3-1, is used for the measurement of inductance and the Q of the 
inductor. It is interesting to note that this type of bridge measures inductance by comparing it with a 
standard capacitor of known characteristics. This arrangement provides the advantage of a wide 
measurement range with the minimum use of electronic parts as comparison standards. A typical range of 
values that can be measured with the Hay bridge is from 1 microhenry to 100 henries. The accuracy of the 
measurements made with this bridge is about 2%. The frequency used in conducting the inductance 
measurement must be taken into account because of the series reactance of capacitor CB. The loss factor 
of the inductor under test is balanced in terms of the Q of the inductor. The Hay bridge, then, is used for 
measurement of inductances having a Q greater than 10. For instance, a Q of 10 gives a calibration error 
of 1%, whereas a Q of 30 gives a calibration error of 0.1%.
