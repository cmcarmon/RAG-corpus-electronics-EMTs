Assume that the inverter has a 0-V input as an initial condition. The
MOSFET is in its off state and the current iL through the inductor L will
be 0. The voltage vL across the inductor is also 0. Now suppose that a 0-V
to VS-step is applied to the input of the inverter as illustrated in Figure 10.32a.
Assume that our goal is to determine the current iL through the inductor and
the voltage vL across the inductor as a function of time.
