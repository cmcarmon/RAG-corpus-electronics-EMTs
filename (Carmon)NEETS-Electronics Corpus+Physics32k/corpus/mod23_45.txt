The best magnetic recording is the one that produces an output signal identical to the input signal. It
didn’t take long to realize that the magnetism generated during the recording process didn’t vary directly
to the current which caused it. This is because there’s a step in the magnetism curve where it crosses the
zero point and changes polarity. This step causes the output signal to be distorted when compared with the
input signal. Figure 1-1 shows this step.
