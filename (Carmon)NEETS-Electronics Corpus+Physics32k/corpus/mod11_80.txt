The INTERELECTRODE CAPACITANCES in a vacuum tube, at low or medium radio frequencies, 
produce capacitive reactances that are so large that no serious effects upon tube operation are noticeable. 
However, as the frequency increases, the reactances become small enough to materially affect the 
performance of a circuit. For example, in figure 2-1A, a 1-picofarad capacitor has a reactance of 159,000 
ohms at 1 megahertz. If this capacitor was the interelectrode capacitance between the grid and plate of a 
tube, and the rf voltage between these electrodes was 500 volts, then 3.15 milliamperes of current would 
flow through the interelectrode capacitance. Current flow in this small amount would not seriously affect 
circuit performance. On the other hand, at a frequency of 100 megahertz the reactance would decrease to 
approximately 1,590 ohms and, with the same voltage applied, current would increase to 315 
milliamperes (figure 2-1B). Current in this amount would definitely affect circuit performance.
