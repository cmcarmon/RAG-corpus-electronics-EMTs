In general relativity, the first term generalizes (includes) both the classical kinetic energy and the interaction with the gravitational field. For a charged particle in an electromagnetic field it is

{\displaystyle L(t)=-mc^{2}{\sqrt {-c^{-2}g_{\mu \nu }(x(t)){\frac {dx^{\mu }(t)}{dt}}{\frac {dx^{\nu }(t)}{dt}}}}+q{\frac {dx^{\mu }(t)}{dt}}A_{\mu }(x(t))\,.}

If the four spacetime coordinates xµ are given in arbitrary units (i.e. unitless), then gµν in m2 is the rank 2 symmetric metric tensor which is also the gravitational potential. Also, Aµ in V·s is the electromagnetic 4-vector potential.
