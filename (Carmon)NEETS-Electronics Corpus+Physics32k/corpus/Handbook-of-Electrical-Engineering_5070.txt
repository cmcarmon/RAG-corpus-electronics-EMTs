at room temperature. Other ISEs have the same type of response, but speciﬁc to a different ion, depending on
the choice of membrane. Many ISEs employ ionophores trapped inside of a polymeric membrane. An ionophore
is a molecule which selectively and reversibly binds with an ion and thereby creates a high exchange rate for
that particular ion.
