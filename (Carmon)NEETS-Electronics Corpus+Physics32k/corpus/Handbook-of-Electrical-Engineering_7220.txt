Mixed-mode  documents: Documents  containing  both  character  and  facsimile  information  within  a  page.
Such  documents  can  be  handled  by  Group  4  facsimile  very  efÔ¨Åciently.  Group  3  facsimile  treats  each
document  as  an  image  to  be  transmitted  pixel  by  pixel.  Mixed-mode  documents  are  subdivided  into
increasingly smaller parts, such as pages, frames, and blocks. A block is a rectangular area that can contain
only one category (character or facsimile information).
