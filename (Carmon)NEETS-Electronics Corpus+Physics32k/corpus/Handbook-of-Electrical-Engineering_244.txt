Regardless of how a linear circuit is stimulated, every node voltage and every branch current, at every instant
of time, must be consistent with Kirchhoff â€™s voltage and current laws. These two laws govern even the most
complex linear circuits. (They also apply to a broad category of nonlinear circuits that are modeled by point
models of voltage and current.)
