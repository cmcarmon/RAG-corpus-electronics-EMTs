The ambient flow conditions which affect lift include the fluid density, viscosity and speed of flow. Lift is proportional to the density of the fluid and approximately proportional to the square of the flow speed. The density, in its turn, may be affected by temperature and, at high speeds approaching or exceeding the speed of sound in the fluid, by compressibility effects. Lift also depends on the size of the wing, being generally proportional to the wing's area projected in the lift direction.
