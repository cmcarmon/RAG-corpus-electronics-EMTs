The basic structure of a gravity intrusion is approximate to that of a classic current with a roughly elliptical 'head' followed by a tail which stretches with increased current length, it is within the rear half of the intrusion head that the majority of mixing with ambient fluids takes place. As with gravity currents, intrusions display the same 'slumping', 'self â€“similar' and 'viscous' phases as gravity currents during propagation.
