Extracellular mechanical forces, which are exerted through focal adhesions, can activate Src kinase and stimulate the growth of the adhesions. As well as, intracellular force generated by actomyosin contractility is sensed by focal adhesion via adhesion proteins such as talin and vinculin . Decreasing actomyosin contractility, using the drug blebbistatin, leads to a decrease in talin tension as well as focal adhesion size . This indicates that focal adhesions may function as mechanical sensors, and suggests that force generated from myosin fibers could contribute to maturing the focal complexes. This gains further support from the fact that inhibition of myosin-generated forces leads to slow disassembly of focal adhesions, by changing the turnover kinetics of the focal adhesion proteins.
The relationship between forces on focal adhesions and their compositional maturation, however, remains unclear. For instance, preventing focal adhesion maturation by inhibiting myosin activity or stress fiber assembly does not prevent forces sustained by focal adhesions, nor does it prevent cells from migrating. Thus force propagation through focal adhesions may not be sensed directly by cells at all time and force scales.
Their role in mechanosensing is important for durotaxis.
