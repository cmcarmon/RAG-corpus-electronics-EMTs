Kepler's third is a direct consequence of the second law. Integrating over one revolution gives the orbital period




T
=



2
π
a
b

h




{\displaystyle T={\frac {2\pi ab}{h}}}

for the area



π
a
b


{\displaystyle \pi ab}
of an ellipse. Replacing the semi-minor axis with



b
=


a
p




{\displaystyle b={\sqrt {ap}}}
and the specific relative angular momentum with



h
=


μ
p




{\displaystyle h={\sqrt {\mu p}}}
one gets




T
=
2
π




a

3


μ





{\displaystyle T=2\pi {\sqrt {\frac {a^{3}}{\mu }}}}

There is thus a relationship between the semi-major axis and the orbital period of a satellite that can be reduced to a constant of the central body. This is the same as the famous formulation of the law:

The square of the period of a planet is proportional to the cube of its mean distance to the Sun.
