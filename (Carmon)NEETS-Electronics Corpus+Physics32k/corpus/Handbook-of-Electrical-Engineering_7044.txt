This  theorem  is  one  of  the  fundamental  theorems  of  information  theory.  It  identiﬁes  the  entropy  as  the
fundamental limit for the average length of the representation of a discrete information source and shows that
we can ﬁnd representations with average length within one bit of the entropy.
