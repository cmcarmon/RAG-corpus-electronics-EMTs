The transducer in some cases may have a local ground that cannot be disconnected. In such
a case, a separate ground strap (braided-wire straps used because of their low inductance) is used
to connect the local ground and the system ground point. The shield is also disconnected from
the ampliﬁer so as to prevent ground-loop current through the shield. Because the ground strap
has nonzero resistance, any stray current through the strap will cause an interference voltage vcm
known as common-mode voltage since it appears at both the transducer and the shield terminals.
vcm is generally quite small; however, when the information-bearing signal voltage itself is rather
small, the common-mode voltage may pose a problem, which can be eliminated by using the
differential ampliﬁer, as shown in Figure 14.3.1. The analysis with the virtual-short model of the
op-amp reveals that
