Recently, a new class of pyroelectric materials which use the effect in the region of Tc have been developed
[Whatmore, 1991]. In these materials a bias ﬁeld must be applied to stabilize the effect, but FD values as high
as 10 to 15 · 10–5 Pa–1/2 have been recorded in such materials as barium strontium titanate or lead scandium
tantalate, both perovskite ceramics. This mode of operation is usually called “dielectric bolometer.”
