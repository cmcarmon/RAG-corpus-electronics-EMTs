FDMA assigns individual channels to individual users. It can
be seen from Figure 7.1 that each user is allocated a unique
frequency channel. These channels are assigned on demand to
subscribers who request service. Guard bands are maintained
between adjacent signal spectra to minimize cross talk between
channels. During the period of the call, no other user can share
the same frequency band. In frequency division duplex (FDD)
systems, the users are assigned a channel as a pair of frequen-
cies; one frequency is used for the upward channel, while the
other frequency is used for the downward channel.
