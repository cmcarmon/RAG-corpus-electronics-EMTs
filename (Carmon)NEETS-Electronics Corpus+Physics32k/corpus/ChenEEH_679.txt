Most older DRAMs are of the pipelined page-mode type.
Pipelined memory implementations improve the throughput
of a memory, but they don’t improve the latency. For instance,
in an extended data output (EDO) RAM, the address decoding
and the actual access to the storage matrix (of the previous
memory access) are done in parallel. In that case, the access
sequence to the DRAM is also important. For example, the
data sheet of an EDO memory chip speciﬁes the sequence
10-2-2-23-2-2-2, where the numbers represent clock cycles.
Each curly bracket indicates four bus cycles of 64-bit each—
that is one cache line. The ﬁrst sequence, 10-2-2-2, speciﬁes the
timing if the page is ﬁrst opened and accessed four times. The
second sequence, 3-2-2-2, speciﬁes the timing if the page was
already open and accessed four additional times—that means
no other memory page was opened and accessed in between
those times. The last sequence repeats as long as memory is
accessed in the same page.
