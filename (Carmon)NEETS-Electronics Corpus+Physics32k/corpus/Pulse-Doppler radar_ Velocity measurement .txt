Pulse-Doppler radar is based on the Doppler effect, where movement in range produces frequency shift on the signal reflected from the target.

{\displaystyle {\text{Doppler frequency}}={\frac {2\times {\text{transmit frequency}}\times {\text{range velocity}}}{C}}.}

Radial velocity is essential for pulse-Doppler radar operation. As the reflector moves between each transmit pulse, the returned signal has a phase difference, or phase shift, from pulse to pulse. This causes the reflector to produce Doppler modulation on the reflected signal.
Pulse-Doppler radars exploit this phenomenon to improve performance.
The amplitude of the successively returning pulse from the same scanned volume is

{\displaystyle x_{0}}

This allows the radar to separate the reflections from multiple objects located in the same volume of space by separating the objects using a spread spectrum to segregate different signals:
