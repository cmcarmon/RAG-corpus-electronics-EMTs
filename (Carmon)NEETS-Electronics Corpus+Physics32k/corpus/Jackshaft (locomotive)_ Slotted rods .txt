Vertical sliding bearings in hornblocks would allow movement, but these must be designed carefully or else the force exerted through the rods would be wasted in simply sliding this bearing back and forth. Such sliding joints must be arranged to allow suspension travel, but so that the rod force is always at right angles to the slideway.
The ten-coupled Italian E550 of 1908 had paired motors, each with a jackshaft. A triangular rod was carried between these, rotating in synchrony and so always horizontal. This carried a sliding crankpin journal for the centre axle, and bearings for the long coupling rods to the unevenly-spaced pairs of drivers ahead and behind. A similar arrangement was used for the Swiss Bern–Lötschberg–Simplon railway Be 5/7 1-E-1 of 1912.
Conceptually similar linkages were used for the Swiss Ce 6/8II crocodiles. As these had only a single traction motor at each end, the triangular frame was also carried by a blind, unpowered, jackshaft. It was slightly inclined, as the motor jackshaft was above the wheel axis.
