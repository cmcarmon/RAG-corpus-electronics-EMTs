Line Parameters
The transmission line parameters can be divided into two parts: series impedance and shunt admittance. Since
these values are subject to installation and utilization, e.g., operation frequency and distance between cables,
the  manufacturers  are  often  unable  to  provide  these  data.  The  most  accurate  values  are  obtained  through
measuring in the Ô¨Åeld, but it has been done only occasionally.
