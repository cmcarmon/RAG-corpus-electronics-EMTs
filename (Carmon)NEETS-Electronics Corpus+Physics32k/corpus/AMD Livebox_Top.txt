The AMD LiveBox is an announced mini-desktop computer that was revealed at Computex 2012. It features a 1 GHz AMD C-60 processor, 1 GB of RAM, a Samsung 64 GB SSD, and Radeon 6200 graphics. With respect to connectivity, it will come with two USB 2.0 ports, a Gigabit Ethernet, HDMI, SD card slot, SIM slot (with support for quad band 3G) and Bluetooth 4.0. There will be no need for any external power brick to power this device as it has its own build in power adapter. There is no WI-FI connectivity in the currently announced model and it is unknown whether there will be a version with such capabilities. It is comparable in size, usability and design as the Intel NUC. There has been no price or release date on the system, and no further details released on the topic. It is uncommon to see such a product being produced by AMD since the company hasnâ€™t played much of a role in the mini desktop scene. Since it is using an x86 based chip, it is capable of running Windows 7 which is also the operating system that it will come preinstalled with. It will also be able to support users wanting to upgrade to Windows 8 without any problems.
