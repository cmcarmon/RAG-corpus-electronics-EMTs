On the other hand, the diode conducts very little when reverse biased. Notice at point C the reverse
bias voltage is 80 volts and the current is only 100 microamperes. This results in 800 k ohms of
resistance, which is considerably larger than the resistance of the junction with forward bias. Because of
these unusual features, the PN junction diode is often used to convert alternating current into direct
current (rectification).
