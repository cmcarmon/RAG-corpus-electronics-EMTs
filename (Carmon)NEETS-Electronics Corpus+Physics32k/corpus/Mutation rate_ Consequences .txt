Cancer and different hereditary diseases are consequences of mutations rates. If normal cells are going through the cell cycle and reproducing at a high rate they have a safety mechanism in place to stop the over production of cells, which can lead to cancer.
This is called TP53, a protein that stops the cell cycle if reproduction occurs rapidly. But, most cancerous cells inactivate the protein TP53 and continue dividing at a high rate causing mutations in the human body.
Other consequences that can occur due to Mutation Rate are different hereditary diseases. Cystic fibrosis, is a genetic disorder mostly affecting the lungs, but also other organs of the body. Cystic fibrosis can also cause clubbing in fingers, which is the enlarging in the tips of fingers due to mutations. HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), has a very high mutation rate which occurs during the replication phase. This happens with Reverse transcriptase (an enzyme used to create complementary DNA from an existing RNA template), and is the reason why HIV weakens our immune system.
There are at least eight common genetic hereditary disorders due to mutation rates in the United States. But there are a huge range of genetic hereditary diseases beyond all types of cancers, Down syndrome and Cystic fibrosis. This shows the effect mutation rate has on the human body.
