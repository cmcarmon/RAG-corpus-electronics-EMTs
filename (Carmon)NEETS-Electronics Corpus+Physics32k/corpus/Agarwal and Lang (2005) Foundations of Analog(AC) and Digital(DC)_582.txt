The nonlinear device is connected to some arbitrary circuit as shown in Figure 4.7.
Following the associated variables discipline, the branch variables vB and iB for the
device are defined as shown in the same figure. Suppose that a measurement reveals
that iB = âˆ’1 mA. What must be the value of vB?
Notice that the polarity of the branch variables has been reversed in Figure 4.7 from
those in Figure 4.5. With this definition of the branch variables, the device equation
becomes
