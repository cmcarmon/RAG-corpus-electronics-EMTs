The effects of additional coils may be illustrated by the addition of a second coil to the armature. The 
commutator must now be divided into four parts since there are four coil ends (see fig. 1-5). The coil is 
rotated in a clockwise direction from the position shown. The voltage induced in the white coil, 
DECREASES FOR THE NEXT 90ยบ  of rotation (from maximum to zero). The voltage induced in the 
black coil INCREASES from zero to maximum at the same time. Since there are four segments in the 
commutator, a new segment passes each brush every 90ยบ  instead of every 180ยบ . This allows the brush to 
switch from the white coil to the black coil at the instant the voltages in the two coils are equal. The brush 
remains in contact with the black coil as its induced voltage increases to maximum, level B in the graph. 
It then decreases to level A, 90ยบ  later. At this point, the brush will contact the white coil again.
