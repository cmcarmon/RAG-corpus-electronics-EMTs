The distribution system has two parts, primary and secondary. The primary distribution system consists of
. The feeders run along the streets and supply
overhead lines or underground cables, which are called 
the distribution transformers that step the voltage down to the secondary level (120â€“480 V). The secondary
distribution system contains overhead lines or underground cables supplying the consumers directly (houses,
light industry, shops, etc.) by single- or three-phase power. Separate, dedicated primary feeders supply industrial
customers requiring several megawatts of power. The subtransmission system directly supplies large factories
consuming over 50 MW.
