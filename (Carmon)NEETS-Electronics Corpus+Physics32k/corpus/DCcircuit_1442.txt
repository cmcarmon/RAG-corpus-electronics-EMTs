The cart, sitting at the top of a slope, possesses potential energy due to the inﬂuence of
gravity and its elevated position on the hill. If we consider the cart’s braking system to be
analogous to the resistance of the system and the cart itself to be the capacitor, what resistance
value would facilitate rapid release of that potential energy? Minimum resistance (no brakes)
would diminish the cart’s altitude quickest, of course! Without any braking action, the cart will
freely roll downhill, thus expending that potential energy as it loses height. With maximum
braking action (brakes ﬁrmly set), the cart will refuse to roll (or it will roll very slowly) and
it will hold its potential energy for a long period of time. Likewise, a capacitive circuit will
discharge rapidly if its resistance is low and discharge slowly if its resistance is high.
