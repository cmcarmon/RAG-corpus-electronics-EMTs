A second type of AC meter uses the iron-vane	
meter	 movement (Figure 22-4). This does not 
 require the conversion of AC to DC. It consists of two 
iron vanes located within a coil: One vane is stationary 
and the other is movable. A pointer is attached to the 
movable vane and moves proportionally to the current 
passing through the coil. The magnetic field of the coil 
induces a north and south pole into the iron vanes. 
 Because like poles repel and both vanes have the same 
polarity, they move away from each other. The iron-
vane movement requires more current for a full-scale 
deflection than does the moving coil meter movement. 
For this reason, iron-vane movements find little appli-
cation in low-power circuits. The iron-vane movement 
is also inaccurate for frequencies above 100 hertz. It is 
used primarily for 60-hertz applications.
