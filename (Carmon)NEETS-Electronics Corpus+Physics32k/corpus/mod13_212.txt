Logic polarity is the type of voltage used to represent the logic 1 state of a statement. We have
determined that the two logic states can be represented by electrical signals. Any two distinct voltages
may be used. For instance, a positive voltage can represent the 1 state, and a negative voltage can
represent the 0 state. The opposite is also true.
