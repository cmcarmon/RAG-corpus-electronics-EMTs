Stability is an important system property. This section is
mostly interested in two types: asymptotic and bounded-
input and bounded-output (BIBO) stability. Asymptotic sta-
bility is a property of an internal representation, such as a
state-space. The representation in 3.3 is said to be asymptoti-
cally stable if the solutions of _xx(t) Â¼ Ax(t ) approach the origin
