Dependability/Security
Another important operating criterion for protective relays is
dependability/security. It is often mentioned as a pair since
dependability and security are selected in a trade-off mode.
Dependability is deﬁned as the relay ability to respond to a
fault by recognizing it each time it occurs. Security is deﬁned
as an ability of a relay not to act if a disturbance is not a fault.
In almost all the relay approaches used today, the relays are
selected with a bias toward dependability or security in such a
way that one affects the other. A more dependable approach
will cause the relays to overtrip, the term used to designate
that the relay will operate whenever there is a fault but at
the expense of possibly tripping even for nonfault events.
The security emphasis will cause relays not to trip for nofault
conditions but at a risk of not operating correctly when
the fault occurs. The mentioned trade-off when selecting
the relaying approach is made by choosing different types of
relaying schemes and related settings to support one or the
other aspect of the relay operation.
