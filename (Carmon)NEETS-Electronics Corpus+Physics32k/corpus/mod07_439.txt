Now, let's consider a complete cycle of operation using a half-wave rectifier, a capacitive filter (C1), 
and a load resistor (RL). As shown in view A of figure 4-17, the capacitive filter (C1) is assumed to be 
large enough to ensure a small reactance to the pulsating rectified current. The resistance of RL is assumed 
to be much greater than the reactance of C1 at the input frequency. When the circuit is energized, the 
diode conducts on the positive half cycle and current flows through the circuit, allowing C1 to charge. C1 
will charge to approximately the peak value of the input voltage. (The charge is less than the peak value 
because of the voltage drop across the diode (D1)). In view A of the figure, the charge on C1 is indicated 
by the heavy solid line on the waveform. As illustrated in view B, the diode cannot conduct on the 
negative half cycle because the anode of D1 is negative with respect to the cathode. During this interval, 
C1 discharges through the load resistor (RL). The discharge of C1 produces the downward slope as 
indicated by the solid line on the waveform in view B. In contrast to the abrupt fall of the applied ac 
voltage from peak value to zero, the voltage across C1 (and thus across RL) during the discharge period 
gradually decreases until the time of the next half cycle of rectifier operation. Keep in mind that for good 
filtering, the filter capacitor should charge up as fast as possible and discharge as little as possible.
