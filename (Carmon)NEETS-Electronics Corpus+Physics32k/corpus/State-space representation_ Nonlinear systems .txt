The more general form of a state-space model can be written as two functions.







x
˙



(
t
)
=

f

(
t
,
x
(
t
)
,
u
(
t
)
)


{\displaystyle \mathbf {\dot {x}} (t)=\mathbf {f} (t,x(t),u(t))}






y

(
t
)
=

h

(
t
,
x
(
t
)
,
u
(
t
)
)


{\displaystyle \mathbf {y} (t)=\mathbf {h} (t,x(t),u(t))}

The first is the state equation and the latter is the output equation. If the function



f
(
⋅
,
⋅
,
⋅
)


{\displaystyle f(\cdot ,\cdot ,\cdot )}
is a linear combination of states and inputs then the equations can be written in matrix notation like above. The



u
(
t
)


{\displaystyle u(t)}
argument to the functions can be dropped if the system is unforced (i.e., it has no inputs).
