Packet networks have been inherently asynchronous. However, as the communications industry moves toward an all IP core and edge network, there is a need to provide synchronization functionality to traditional TDM-based applications. This is essential for the interworking with PSTN. The goal is provide a Primary Reference Clock (PRC) traceable clock for the TDM applications.
