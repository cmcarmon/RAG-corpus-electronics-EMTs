Now, keeping the value of vGS at the same fixed value, we increase vDS
further, and plot our observations in Figure 7.9. Notice that as vDS approaches
the value of vGS − VT, the curve bends and begins to flatten out. In other
words, the current iDS saturates as vDS begins to exceed vGS − VT. In fact,
