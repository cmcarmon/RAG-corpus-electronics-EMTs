Synchros are used primarily for the rapid and accurate transmission of information between 
equipment and stations. Examples of such information are changes in course, speed, and range of targets 
or missiles; angular displacement (position) of the ship's rudder; and changes in the speed and depth of 
torpedoes. This information must be transmitted quickly and accurately. Synchros can provide this speed 
and accuracy. They are reliable, adaptable, and compact. Figure 1-2 shows a simple synchro system that 
can be used to transmit different as of data or information In this system, a single synchro transmitter 
furnishes information to two synchro receivers located in distant spaces. Operators put information into 
the system by turning the handwheel. As the handwheel turns, its attached gear rotates the transmitter 
shaft (which has a dial attached to indicate the value of the transmitted information). As the synchro 
transmitter shaft turns, it converts the mechanical input into an electrical signal, which is sent through 
interconnecting wiring to the two synchro receivers. The receiver shafts rotate in response to the electrical 
signal from the transmitter. When these shafts turn, the dials attached to the shafts indicate the transmitted 
information.
