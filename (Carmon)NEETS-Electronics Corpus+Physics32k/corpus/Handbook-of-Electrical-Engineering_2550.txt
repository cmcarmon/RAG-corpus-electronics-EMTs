The converse is also true: the input at the base presents a high resistance. This is simply because whereas
much the same signal voltage appears at the base as at the emitter, the base signal current ib is smaller than the
emitter signal current ie by a factor of (hfe + 1) . hfe. Hence, the apparent resistance at the base must be at
least hfeRE. To this must be added rbb¢ + rb¢e so that
