According to former Reduced Gravity Research Program director John Yaniec, anxiety contributes most to passengers' airsickness. The stress on their bodies creates a sense of panic and therefore causes the passenger to vomit. Yaniec gives a rough estimate of passengers, that "one third [become] violently ill, the next third moderately ill, and the final third not at all." Vomiting is referred to as "ill".
On commercial flights offered by Zero Gravity Corporation, very few passengers experience motion discomfort. This is because the Zero Gravity Corporation's flights are much shorter than NASA's flights.
Scopolamine is often used as an antiemetic during reduced-gravity-aircraft training.
