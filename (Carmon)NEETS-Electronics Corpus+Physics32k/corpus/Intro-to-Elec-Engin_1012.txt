When a machine has more than two poles, only a single pair of poles needs to be considered
because the electric, magnetic, and mechanical conditions associated with every other pole pair
are repetitions of those for the pole pair under consideration. The angle subtended by one pair
of poles in a P-pole machine (or one cycle of ﬂux distribution) is deﬁned to be 360 electrical
degrees, or 2π electrical radians. So the relationship between the mechanical angle m and the
angle  in electrical units is given by
