Many of the practical design situations used to test the frequency domain design approach are described in the
excellent classic text by Bower and Schultheiss [1958]. A rather detailed discussion of the approach may also
be found in Sage [1978] on which this discussion is, in part, based. A great variety of control systems design
approaches, including frequency domain design approaches, are discussed in a recent deÔ¨Ånitive control systems
encyclopedia [Singh, 1987], and there are a plethora of new introductory control systems textbooks that discuss
it  as  well.  As  noted  earlier,  frequency  domain  design,  in  particular,  and  control  systems  design,  in  general,
constitute one facet of systems engineering effort, such as described in Sage [1992].
