Foot morphology in this context mainly refers to the ratio of forefoot (in front of the ankle joint) to the hindfoot (behind the ankle joint). This ratio is an indication of the effective mechanical advantage (EMA) and can also be represented by a balancing seesaw. A study done on humans, comparing ankle-foot structure using MRI, showed that sprinters had a longer forefoot:hindfoot ratio compared to non-sprinters. This allows the foot to remain in contact with the ground for longer amount of time while decreasing the moment arm. This decreases the rate of muscle shortening and increases the force generated by extensor muscles during the push off phase. These larger gear ratios during the push off phase have been shown to occur in accelerating humans as well as top animal sprinters. Larger moment arms of the cheetah may be achieved if the forefoot is also proportionally larger.
