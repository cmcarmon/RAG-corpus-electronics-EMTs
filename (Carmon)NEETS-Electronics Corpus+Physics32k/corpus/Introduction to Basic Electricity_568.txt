■● Listen actively: Respect the person speaking, ask 
probing questions, and acknowledge what’s said 
by repeating points that have been made. If some-
thing is unclear, ask for more information to clarify 
any confusion before moving on. Listening is a 
vital activity of any team and is the other half of 
communication.
