Truncation
The  truncated  cardinal  series  is  in  Eq.  (73.75). A  signal  cannot  be  both  bandlimited  and  of  ﬁnite  duration.
Indeed,  a  bandlimited  function  cannot  be  identically  zero  over  any  ﬁnite  interval.  Thus,  other  than  the  rare
case where an inﬁnite number of the signal’s zero crossings coincide with the sample locations, truncation will
result in an error.
