Analog signals in an analog communication system can be transmitted directly via carrier
modulation over the communication channel and demodulated accordingly at the receiver. Alter-
natively, an analog source output may be converted into a digital form and the message can be
transmitted via digital modulation and demodulated as a digital signal at the receiver. Potential
advantages in transmitting an analog signal by means of digital modulation are the following:
