Purely  mechanical  problems  are  often  only  a  subset  of  larger  multi-domain 
problems faced by the designer. Particularly, the solutions of many of todayâ€™s interesting 
problems  require  expertise  in  both  mechanical  engineering  and  electrical  engineering. 
DVD players, digital projectors, modern cars, machine tools, and digital cameras are just 
a  few  examples  of  the  results  of  such  combined  innovation.  In  these  hybrid  systems, 
design  trade-offs  often  span  the  knowledge  space  of  both  mechanical  and  electrical 
engineering. For example, in a car engine, is it more cost-effective to design a precise 
mechanical timing mechanism to trigger the firing of each cylinder, or is it better to use 
electronic sensors to measure the positions of each piston and then use a microprocessor 
to trigger the firing? For every problem, designers with combined expertise in mechanical 
and electrical engineering will be able to devise more ideas of possible solutions and be 
able to better evaluate the feasibility of each idea.
