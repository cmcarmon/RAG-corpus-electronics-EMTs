The mathematical model for round-rotor machines is much simpler than that for salient-rotor ones. This
stems from the fact that the rotor body has a permeability much higher than that of the air. In a steady state,
the stator ﬁeld and the rotor body are at a standstill relative to each other. (They rotate at the same speed as
discussed earlier.) If the rotor is salient, it is easier to establish the magnetic ﬂux lines along the direction of
the rotor body (when viewed from the cross section). Therefore, for the same set of stator currents, different
positions of the rotor alter the stator ﬁeld in different ways; this implies that the induced emf ’s are different.
If the rotor is round, then the relative position of the rotor structure does not affect the stator ﬁeld. Hence, the
associated mathematical model is simpliﬁed.
