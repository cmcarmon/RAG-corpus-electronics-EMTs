Any physical law which can be expressed as a variational principle describes a self-adjoint operator (according to Cornelius Lanczos). These expressions are also called Hermitian. Such an expression describes an invariant under a Hermitian transformation.
Statements of variational principles are rewarded by the Fermat Prize.
