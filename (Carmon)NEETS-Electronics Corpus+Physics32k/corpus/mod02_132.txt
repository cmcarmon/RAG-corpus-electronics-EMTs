 UNIT OF INDUCTANCE—Inductance (L) is measured in henrys (H). An inductor has an 
inductance of one henry (H) if an emf of one volt is induced in the inductor when the current through the 
inductor is changing at the rate of 1 ampere per second. Common units of inductance are henry (H), 
millihenry (mH) and the microhenry (µH).
