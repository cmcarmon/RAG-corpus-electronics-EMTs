The reference power measurement is then made. For the bend-reference technique, the launch and
detection conditions are not changed, but an additional bend is added to the test fiber. The test fiber is
bent to a radius of 30 mm or less to suppress the second-order mode at all the scanned wavelengths. For
the multimode-reference technique, the single mode fiber is replaced with a 2-m length of multimode
fiber. The transmitted signal power Pr ( l ) is recorded while scanning the same wavelength range in the
same increments of 10 nm or less. The attenuation A(l ) at each wavelength is calculated as follows:
