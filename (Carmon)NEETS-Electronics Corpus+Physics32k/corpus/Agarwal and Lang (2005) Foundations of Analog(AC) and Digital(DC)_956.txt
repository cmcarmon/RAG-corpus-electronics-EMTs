As shown in Figure 7.22, notice that the magnitude of the slope of certain
regions of the curve is greater than one, thereby amplifying input signals that
fall within this region. Shortly, we will take a more careful look at how we can
connect an input signal to the amplifier so that it is amplified by leveraging the
