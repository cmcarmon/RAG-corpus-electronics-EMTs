▶✓ Red‐red‐yellow‐gold: A resistor with red (2), red (2), yellow (4 zeros), 
and gold (±5%) bands (see Figure 5­10, top) provides a nominal resis­
tance of 220,000 Ω, or 220 kΩ, which could vary up or down by as much 
as 5% of that value. So it could have a resistance of anywhere between 
209 kΩ and 231 kΩ.
