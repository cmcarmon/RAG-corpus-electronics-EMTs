phasors, with the additional understanding that a function such as v(t) or i(t) can be interpreted
graphically in terms of a rotating phasor in the counterclockwise direction (considered positive
for positive ω and positive t). When the frequency of rotation becomes a constant equal to ω
rad/s, the projection of a rotating phasor on the real (horizontal) axis varies as cos ωt, whereas its
projection on the imaginary (vertical) axis varies as sin ωt.
The use of a single exponential function with s = j ω to imply sinusoidal excitation (and
