The ﬁeld of signal processing has grown phenomenally in
the past years. This growth has been fueled by theoretical and
algorithmic developments, technological advances in hardware
and software, and ever widening applications that have gener-
ated an insatiable demand for signal processing tools. Theory
and practice in a number of ﬁelds have been greatly inﬂuenced
by signal processing (e.g., communications, controls, acoustics,
music, seismology, medicine, and biomedical engineering).
