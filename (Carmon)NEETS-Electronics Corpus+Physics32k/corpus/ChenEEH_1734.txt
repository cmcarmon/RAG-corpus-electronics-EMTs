the inadequacy of the current best-effort Internet model to
satisfy the multimedia trafﬁc requirements. We describe three
enhanced architectures: Integrated Services (White, 2001), Dif-
ferentiated Services (Blake et al., 1998) and Multi-Protocol
Label Switching (Rosen et al., 2001). These architectures have
been proposed to overcome these shortcomings. Section 7.4
presents some standard approaches for meeting the functional
requirements posed by multimedia trafﬁc. Later in this section,
we present two protocol architectures (H.323 and SIP) that
have been introduced for the Internet protocol stack to satisfy
these requirements. Section 7.5 describes current efforts to
support multimedia trafﬁc over the cellular/wireless networks;
we illustrate issues related to internetworking between wired
and wireless networks.
