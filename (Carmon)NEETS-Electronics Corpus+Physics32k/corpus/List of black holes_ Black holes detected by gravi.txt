The black holes involved in the binary black hole merger that produced the gravitational wave signal GW150914. Note that this detection confirmed the (former) existence of 3 black holes: the two original black holes with masses of 29 and 32 solar masses that merged to form one heavier black hole with a mass of 62 solar masses.
The black holes involved in the binary black hole merger that produced the gravitational wave signal GW151226. Note that, as for GW150914, this detection confirmed the existence of three black holes: two initial black holes of mass 14 and 8 solar masses that merged into a new, more massive black hole of 21 solar masses.
The black holes involved in the binary black hole merger that produced the gravitational wave signal GW170104.
The black holes involved in the binary black hole merger that produced the gravitational wave signal GW170608.
The black holes involved in the binary black hole merger that produced the gravitational wave signal GW170814.
