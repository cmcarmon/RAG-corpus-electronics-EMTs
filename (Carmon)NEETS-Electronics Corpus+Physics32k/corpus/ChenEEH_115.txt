This chapter has presented an introduction to certain basic
results in graph theory and their application in the analysis of
electrical circuits. For a more comprehensive treatment of
other developments in circuit theory that are primarily of a
graph-theoretic nature, refer to works by Swamy and Thula-
siraman (1981) and Chen (1972). A publication by Seshu and
Reed (1961) is an early work that Ô¨Årst discussed many of the
fundamental results presented in this chapter. A review by
Watandabe and Shinoda (1999) is the most recent reference
summarizing the graph theoretic contributions from Japanese
circuit theory researchers.
