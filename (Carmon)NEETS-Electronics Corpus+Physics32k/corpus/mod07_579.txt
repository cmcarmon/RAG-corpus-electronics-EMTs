CAPACITANCE FILTERS are nothing more than large capacitors placed across the output of the 
rectifier section. Because of the large size of the capacitors, fast charge paths, and slow discharge paths, 
the capacitor will charge to average value, which will keep the pulsating dc output from reaching zero 
volts.
