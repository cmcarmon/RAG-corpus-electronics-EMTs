To obtain this type of insight, we shall focus primarily upon
the ﬁrst class above, in which the feedback is deliberately put
into play. In such situations, one big variable is the nature of
the process which is being controlled by the use of feedback.
One may be controlling speed, or pressure, or temperature, or
voltage, or current, or just about any variable that one can
imagine. To capture at least a bit of this ﬂavor of the subject,
the chapter addresses a wide range of different processes which
are being placed under control. A second big variable is the
design purpose for which the feedback is applied. Perhaps it is
for stabilization, tracking, or ampliﬁcation. Perhaps it is for
coping with process model errors which arise because the
process is too complicated to model exactly—assuming that
we have the knowledge to do so. Perhaps it is for coping with
disturbances, such as noise interfering with the transfer of data
from one portal of a circuit to another. Or perhaps it is because
we cannot get good estimates of key circuit and system param-
eters, or we cannot obtain a big enough budget to make all the
measurements we want, or to install all the actuators we wish.
In the face of all these sorts of issues, we approach the task
here by creating a diverse sample of the sorts of issues which
can arise. One can create entire handbooks on controls; and
that has been done. In fact, one can create encyclopedias on
controls; and that has been done. Here we have only a section,
and we approach the question by taking samples. This is
entirely in the spirit of the subject; and the task of the reader
is to try to master the behavior of the whole body of knowledge
from these samples! Welcome to the experience of feedback
circuits and systems!!!
