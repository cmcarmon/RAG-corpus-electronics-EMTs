The GaN sample discussed here was a square (6 mm × 6 mm) layer grown on sapphire to a thickness of d =
20 µm. Small indium dots were soldered on the corners to provide ohmic contacts, and the Hall measurements
were  carried  out  in  an  apparatus  similar  to  that  illustrated  in  Fig. 22.38.  Temperature  control  was  achieved
using a He exchange-gas dewar. The temperature dependencies of nH and µ
H are shown in Figs. 22.39 and 22.40,
