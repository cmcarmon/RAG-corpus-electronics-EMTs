Radiotelephone has some disadvantages. You may find transmissions unreadable because of static, 
enemy interference, or high local noise level caused by shouts, gunfire, and bomb or shell bursts. Wave 
propagation characteristics of radiotelephone frequencies sometimes are unpredictable, and tactical 
transmissions may be heard from great distances. Most radiotelephone messages are in plain language, 
and if information is to be kept from the enemy, users must keep their messages short, stick to the proper 
procedures, and be careful of what they say.
