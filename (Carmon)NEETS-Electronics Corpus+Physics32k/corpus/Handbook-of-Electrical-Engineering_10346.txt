Video Teleconferencing
Satellite communications provides a cost-effective and ﬂexible means of interactive videoconferencing. Tech-
nological  improvement  in  videocompression  has  resulted  in  low-cost  codecs  at  data  rates  less  than  T1,  and
good quality videoconferencing is possible at data rates as low as 56 Kbps. Low-cost satellite terminals coupled
with low-cost codecs are making videoconferencing via satellite affordable and practical for many organizations.
Applications include all types of business meetings and technical information exchange such as management
and staff meetings, new product introductions and updates, sales meetings, training, and market presentations.
Videoconferencing allows people at different locations to meet with almost as much ease as being in the same
room, providing beneﬁts of increased productivity, reduced travel time and cost, and increased management
visibility.
