tionality constants between the components of the electric ﬁeld and the components of the stress. Similarly 
ij

electric ﬁeld E and of the electric displacement D. If the material is nonpiezoelectric
equations of Eq. (48.6) reduce to the corresponding three of Eq. (48.1), whereas the fourth equation becomes
the anisotropic Laplace equation. In a piezoelectric, these mechanical and electrical components are coupled.
The plane wave solution of Eq. (48.6) then has the three mechanical components of Eq. (48.2) and in addition
