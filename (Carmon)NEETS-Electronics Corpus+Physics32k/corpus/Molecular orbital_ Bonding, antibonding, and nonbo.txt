When atomic orbitals interact, the resulting molecular orbital can be of three types: bonding, antibonding, or nonbonding.
Bonding MOs:
Bonding interactions between atomic orbitals are constructive (in-phase) interactions.
Bonding MOs are lower in energy than the atomic orbitals that combine to produce them.
Antibonding MOs:
Antibonding interactions between atomic orbitals are destructive (out-of-phase) interactions, with a nodal plane where the wavefunction of the antibonding orbital is zero between the two interacting atoms
Antibonding MOs are higher in energy than the atomic orbitals that combine to produce them.
Nonbonding MOs:
Nonbonding MOs are the result of no interaction between atomic orbitals because of lack of compatible symmetries.
Nonbonding MOs will have the same energy as the atomic orbitals of one of the atoms in the molecule.
