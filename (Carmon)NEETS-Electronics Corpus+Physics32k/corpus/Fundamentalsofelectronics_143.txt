Resistors connected in such a way that current from one must ﬂow only into another—currents in all
resistors connected this way have the same magnitude—are said to be connected in series. For the two
series-connected resistors in the example, the voltage across one resistor equals the ratio of that
resistor’s value and the sum of resistances times the voltage across the series combination.
This concept is so pervasive it has a name: voltage divider.
