To illustrate the state-variable analysis of a circuit, consider the analysis of
the circuit shown in W W W Figure 12.50. To analyze this circuit we replace
the capacitor by a voltage source and the inductor by a current source as
shown in Figure 12.62. Next we analyze this circuit to determine iC and vL.
This results in
