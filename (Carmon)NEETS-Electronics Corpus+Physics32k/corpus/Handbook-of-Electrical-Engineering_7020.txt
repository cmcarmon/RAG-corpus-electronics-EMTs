where log2 e = 1.44. This means that the energy per bit necessary for reliable communication is equal to 0.69
times  the  noise  power  spectral  density  level. When  the  channel  bandwidth  is  Ô¨Ånite,  the  energy  necessary  to
send one bit of information is strictly larger. The energy required to send one bit of information reliably can
