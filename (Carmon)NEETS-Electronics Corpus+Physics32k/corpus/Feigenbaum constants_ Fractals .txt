the Feigenbaum constant is the ratio between the diameters of successive circles on the real axis in the complex plane (see animation on the right).

Bifurcation parameter is a root point of period-2n component. This series converges to the Feigenbaum point c = −1.401155...... The ratio in the last column converges to the first Feigenbaum constant.
Other maps also reproduce this ratio, in this sense the Feigenbaum constant in bifurcation theory is analogous to π in geometry and e in calculus.
