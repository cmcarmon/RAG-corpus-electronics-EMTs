During the positive half-cycle of the input signal, the diode is conducting and the capacitor
charges up to the peak value of the input signal. When the input falls below the voltage on the
capacitor, the diode becomes reverse-biased and the input becomes disconnected from the output.
During this period, the capacitor discharges slowly through the load resistor R. On the next cycle
of the carrier, the diode conducts again when the input signal exceeds the voltage across the
capacitor. The capacitor charges up again to the peak value of the input signal, and the process is
continued. The time constant RC must be selected to follow the variations in the envelope of the
carrier-modulated signal. Generally, it is so chosen that
