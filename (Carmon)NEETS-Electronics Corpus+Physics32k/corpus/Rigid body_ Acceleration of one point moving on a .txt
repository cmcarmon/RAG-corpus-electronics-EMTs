{\displaystyle {}^{\mathrm {N} }\mathbf {a} ^{\mathrm {R} }={}^{\mathrm {N} }\mathbf {a} ^{\mathrm {Q} }+{}^{\mathrm {B} }\mathbf {a} ^{\mathrm {R} }+2{}^{\mathrm {N} }{\boldsymbol {\omega }}^{\mathrm {B} }\times {}^{\mathrm {B} }\mathbf {v} ^{\mathrm {R} }}

where Q is the point fixed in B that instantaneously coincident with R at the instant of interest. This equation is often combined with Acceleration of two points fixed on a rigid body.
