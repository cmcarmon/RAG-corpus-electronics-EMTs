The frequency response of dielectrics at the more elevated frequencies is primarily of interest in the electrical
communications ﬁeld. In contradistinction for electrical power generation, transmission, and distribution, it
is the low-frequency spectrum that constitutes the area of application. Also, the use of higher voltages in the
electrical power area necessarily requires detailed knowledge of how the electrical losses vary as a function of
the electrical ﬁeld. Since most electrical power apparatus operates at a ﬁxed frequency of 50 or 60 Hz, the main
variable apart from the temperature is the applied or operating voltage. At power frequencies the dipole losses
are generally very small and invariant with voltage up to the saturation ﬁelds which exceed substantially the
operating ﬁelds, being in the order of 107 kV cm–1 or more. However, both the space charge polarization and
ionic losses are highly ﬁeld-dependent. As the electrical ﬁeld is increased, ions of opposite sign are increasingly
segregated; this hinders their recombination and, in effect, enhances the ion charge carrier concentration. As
the dissociation rate of the ionic impurities is further augmented by temperature increases, combined rises in
temperature and ﬁeld may lead to appreciable dielectric loss. Thus, for example, for a thin liquid ﬁlm bounded
by two solids, tand increases with voltage until at some upper voltage value the physical boundaries begin to
ﬁnally limit the amplitude of the ion excursions, at which point tand commences a downward trend with voltage
(Böning–Garton effect). The interfacial or space charge polarization losses may evince a rather intricate ﬁeld
dependence, depending upon the manner in which the discrete conductivities of the contiguous media change
