The MOSFET channel is created by attraction to the gate and relies upon the insulating layer between the
channel and the gate to prevent leakage of minority carriers to the gate. As a result, MOSFETs can be made
only in material systems that provide very good gate insulators, and the best system known is the siliconâ€“silicon
dioxide combination. This requirement for a good gate insulator is not so important for JFETs and MESFETs,
where the role of the gate is to push away majority carriers rather than to attract minority carriers. Thus, in
GaAs systems where good insulators are incompatible with other device or fabricational requirements, MESFETs
are used.
