The symbol used to represent an inverter or NOT 
function is shown in Figure 42-6. The triangle portion 
of the symbol represents the circuit, and the circle, or 
“bubble,” represents the circuit inversion, or comple-
mentary characteristic. The choice of symbol depends 
on where the inverter is used. If the inverter uses a 1 
as the qualifying input, the symbol in Figure 42-6A is 
used. If the inverter uses a 0 as the qualifying input, 
the symbol in Figure 42-6B is used.
