Radiation exposure is a measure of the ionization of air due to ionizing radiation from photons; that is, gamma rays and X-rays. It is defined as the electric charge freed by such radiation in a specified volume of air divided by the mass of that air.
The SI unit of exposure is the coulomb per kilogram (C/kg), which has largely replaced the roentgen (R). One 1 roentgen equals 0.000258 C/kg; an exposure of one coulomb per kilogram is equivalent to 3876 roentgens.
As a measure of radiation damage exposure has been superseded by the concept of absorbed dose which takes into account the absorption characteristic of the target material.
