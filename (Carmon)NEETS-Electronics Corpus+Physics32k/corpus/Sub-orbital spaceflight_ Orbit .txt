During freefall the trajectory is part of an elliptic orbit as given by the orbit equation. The perigee distance is less than the radius of the Earth R including atmosphere, hence the ellipse intersects the Earth, and hence the spacecraft will fail to complete an orbit. The major axis is vertical, the semi-major axis a is more than R/2. The specific orbital energy

{\displaystyle \epsilon }
is given by:

Almost always a < R, corresponding to a lower

Thus the net extra specific energy needed compared to just raising the spacecraft into space is between 0 and
