We should point out that the so-called H2 controller is equivalent to the LQG controller but provides a uniﬁed
framework for control and observation that explains the striking similarity between the LQ controller equations
and the Kalman ﬁlter equations (for example, in the Riccati equations of (100.148) and (100.63)). See Zhou
and Doyle [1998] for further information.
