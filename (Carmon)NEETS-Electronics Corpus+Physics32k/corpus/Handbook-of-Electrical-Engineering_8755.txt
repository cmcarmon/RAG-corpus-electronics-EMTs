The next improvement in procedural programming came in the form of increased abstraction, called ADT
(abstract data structures). An ADT separates the interface part of a procedure from its implementation part.
Modula II and Ada™ were designed to support ADTs in the form of modules and packages. The interface part
is an abstraction that hides the details of the algorithm. Programming in this form of the procedural paradigm
reduces complexity by elevating a programmer’s thoughts to a higher level of abstraction, but it still does not
remove the problem of how procedures are related to one another.
