When the bias on a pin diode is varied, the microwave resistance changes from a typical value of 6 
kilohms under negative bias to about 5 ohms when the bias is positive. Thus when the diode is mounted 
across a transmission line or waveguide, the loading effect is insignificant while the diode is reverse 
biased, and the diode presents no interference to power flow. When the diode is forward biased, the 
resistance drops to approximately 5 ohms and most power is reflected. In other words, the diode acts as a 
switch when mounted in parallel with a transmission line or waveguide. Several diodes in parallel can 
switch power in excess of 150 kilowatts peak. The upper power limit is determined by the ability of the 
diode to dissipate power. The upper frequency limit is determined by the shunt capacitance of the pn 
junction, shown as C1 in figure 2-53A. Pin diodes with upper limit frequencies in excess of 30 gigahertz 
are available.
