In stowage spaces, individual pieces of test equipment should be held in place by stretch seat-belt-
type straps. If bars are used to hold equipment on shelves, meters and control knobs should be protected
by blocking the equipment to prevent it from rolling and sliding on the shelf. Test equipment too large for
shelf stowage should be kept in stowage cases and tie-downs provided to secure the cases. Refer to
Stowage Guide for Portable Test Equipment, NAVSEA ST000-AB-GYD-010/GPETE, to determine
adequate stowage space and proper weight support requirements.
