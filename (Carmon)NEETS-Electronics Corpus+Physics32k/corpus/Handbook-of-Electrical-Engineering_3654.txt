Negative  values  of  exchange  result  in  an  antiparallel  arrangement  of  the  spins  of  adjacent  atoms  and  in
antiferromagnetic  materials  (Fig. 36.3).  Until  5  years  ago,  it  was  true  to  say  that  antiferromagnetism  had  no
practical application. Thin ﬁlms on antiferromagnetic materials are now used to provide the bias ﬁeld which
is  used  to  linearize  the  response  of  some  magnetoresistive  reading  heads  in  magnetic  disk  drives.  Ferrimag-
netism, also illustrated in Fig. 36.3, is much more widely used. It can be produced as soft, i.e., low coercivity,
ferrites for use in magnetic recording and reading heads or in the core of transformers operating at frequencies
up to tens of megahertz. High-coercivity, single-domain particles (which are discussed later) are used in very
large quantities to make magnetic recording tapes and ﬂexible disks g-Fe2O3 and cobalt-impregnated iron oxides
and to make barium ferrite, the most widely used material for permanent magnets.
