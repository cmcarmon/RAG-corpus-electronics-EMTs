microprocessor. The microprocessor is usually based on an
existing architecture from manufacturers
such as ARM,
MIPS, or IBM to exploit the existing software base. On the
research side, the Garp device (Callahan et al., 2000) and the
NAPA device (Rupp et al., 1998) are two examples of proces-
sor/FPGA hybrid devices.
