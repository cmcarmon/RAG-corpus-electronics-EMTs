The stator in figure 3-6 consists of two single-phase windings completely separated from each other.
Each winding is made up of two windings that are connected in series so that their voltages add. The rotor
is identical to that used in the single-phase alternator. In the left-hand schematic, the rotor poles are
opposite all the windings of phase A. Therefore, the voltage induced in phase A is maximum, and the
voltage induced in phase B is zero. As the rotor continues rotating counterclockwise, it moves away from
the A windings and approaches the B windings. As a result, the voltage induced in phase A decreases
from its maximum value, and the voltage induced in phase B increases from zero. In the right-hand
schematic, the rotor poles are opposite the windings of phase B. Now the voltage induced in phase B is
maximum, whereas the voltage induced in phase A has dropped to zero. Notice that a 90-degree rotation
of the rotor corresponds to one-quarter of a cycle, or 90 electrical degrees. The waveform picture shows
the voltages induced in phase A and B for one cycle. The two voltages are 90ยบ  out of phase. Notice that
the two outputs, A and B, are independent of each other. Each output is a single-phase voltage, just as if
the other did not exist.
