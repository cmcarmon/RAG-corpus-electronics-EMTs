PM of a local data
path Ri?Rj introduced in deﬁnition 4.4. Using the substitu-
tions, equations 4.3 and 4.4, the timing constraints of a local
data path Ri?Rf are rewritten in equations 4.5 and 4.6. A pair
of constraints such as in these latter equations must be satisﬁed
for each local data path in a circuit for this circuit to operate
correctly. Furthermore, the local data path timing constraints
lead to the concept of a permissible range introduced in
