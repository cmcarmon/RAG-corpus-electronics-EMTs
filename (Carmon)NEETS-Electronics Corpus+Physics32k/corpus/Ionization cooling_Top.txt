In accelerator physics, ionization cooling is a process for reducing the emittance of ("cooling") a charged particle beam. In ionization cooling, particles are passed through some material. The momentum of the particles is reduced as they ionize atomic electrons in the material. Thus the normalised beam emittance is reduced. By re-accelerating the beam, for example in an RF cavity, the longitudinal momentum may be restored without replacing transverse momentum. Thus overall the angular spread and hence the geometric emittance in the beam will be reduced.
Ionization cooling can be spoiled by stochastic physical processes. Multiple Coulomb scattering in muons as well as nuclear scattering in protons and ions can reduce the cooling or even lead to net heating transverse to the direction of beam motion. In addition, energy straggling can cause heating parallel to the direction of beam motion.
