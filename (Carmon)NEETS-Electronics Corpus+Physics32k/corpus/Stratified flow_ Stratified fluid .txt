A stratified fluid may be defined as a fluid with density variations in the vertical direction. For example, air and water considered together can be seen as a stratified fluid system. Density variations in the atmosphere profoundly affect the motion of water and air. Wave phenomena in the air flow over the mountains and occurrences of smog are examples of the stratification effect in the atmosphere.
When a fluid system in which fluid density decreases with height is disturbed, gravity and friction restore the undisturbed conditions.
