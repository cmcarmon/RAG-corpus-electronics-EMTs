(2) Delay distortion: The velocity of propogation of a
signal through a guided medium varies with frequen-
cies; it is fast at the center of the frequency, but it falls
off at the two edges of frequencies. Equalization tech-
niques can be used to smooth out the delay distortion.
Delay distortion is a major reason for the timing jitter
problem, where the receiver clock deviates from the
incoming signal in a random fashion so that an in-
coming signal might arrive earlier or late.
