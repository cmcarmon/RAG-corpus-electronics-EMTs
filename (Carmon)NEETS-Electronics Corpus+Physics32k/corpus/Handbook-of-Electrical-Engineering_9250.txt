For such a mainstream activity as test planning, both the literature and tool suites are surprisingly sparse.
The standard reference is Myers [1979]. The basic aspects of test planning are to consider which of the many
varieties of testing will be carried out and to specify the number and kind of test cases that will be performed
at  each  step.  U.S.  military  speciﬁcations  are  fairly  thorough  in  deﬁning  the  contents  of  test  plans.  There  are
also commercial books and courses available, but on the whole the topic of test planning is underreported in
the software literature.
