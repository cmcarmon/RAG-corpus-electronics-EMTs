The reasons why the circuit in figure 1-8 oscillates at the resonant frequency have to do with the 
characteristics of resonant circuits. The discussion of parallel resonance will not be as detailed as that for 
series resonance because the idea of resonance is the same for both circuits. Certain characteristics differ 
as a result of L and C being in parallel rather than in series. These differences will be emphasized.
