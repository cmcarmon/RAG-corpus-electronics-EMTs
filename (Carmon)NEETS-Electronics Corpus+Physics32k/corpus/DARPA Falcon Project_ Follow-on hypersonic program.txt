Following the Phase 2 contract, DARPA and the US Air Force continued to develop the hypersonic vehicle platform.
The program was to follow a set of flight tests with a series of hypersonic technology vehicles.
The FALCON project includes:
X-41 Common Aero Vehicle (CAV): a common aerial platform for hypersonic ICBMs and cruise missiles, as well as civilian RLVs and ELVs.
Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 1 (HTV-1): a test concept, originally planned to fly in September 2007, now canceled.
Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 (HTV-2): first flew on 22 April 2010, but contact was lost soon after booster separation
HTV-3X: Blackswift, now canceled
The Hypersonic Cruise Vehicle (HCV) would be able to fly 9,000 nautical miles (17,000 km) in 2 hours with a payload of 12,000 lb (5,500 kg). It would fly at a high altitude and achieve speeds of up to Mach 20.
