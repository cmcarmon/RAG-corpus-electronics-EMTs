Optical  ﬁbers  are  slender  glass  or  plastic  cylinders  with  annular  cross  sections.  The  core  has  a  refractive
, of the annular region (the cladding). Light propagation
index, 
is conﬁned to the core by total internal reﬂection, even when the ﬁber is bent into curves and loops. Optical
ﬁbers  fall  into  two  main  categories:  step-index  and  graded-index  (GRIN)  ﬁbers.  For  step-index  ﬁbers,  the
 given by
r
refractive index is constant within the core. For GRIN ﬁbers, the refractive index is a function of radius
