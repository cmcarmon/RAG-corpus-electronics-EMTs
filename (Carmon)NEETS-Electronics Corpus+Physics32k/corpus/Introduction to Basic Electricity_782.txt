■● Automatic routing—Circuit Wizard includes 
an advanced automatic router that can route 
 single-sided and double-sided boards. Using the 
latest “rip-up and retry” technology, it achieves 
extremely high completion rates by going back and 
rerouting nets to make space for connections that 
could not be routed on a previous pass.
