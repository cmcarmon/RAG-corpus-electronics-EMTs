employee (D_EMPLOYEE) is one-to-many. This relationship deÔ¨Ånes a set type where the owner record type
is DEPARTMENT and the member record type is D_EMPLOYEE. Each instance of an owner record type along
with all the corresponding member records represents a set instance of the underlying set type. In practice, a
set is commonly implemented using a circular-linked list which allows an owner record to be linked to all its
member records. The pointer associated with the owner record is known as the FIRST pointer, and the one
associated with a member record is known as a NEXT pointer.
