dependent	on	each	other,	another	(and	it	has	to	be	from	a	generic	source)	electric
current	needs	to	enter	the	picture.
Moreover,	Nortonâ€™s	Theorem	gives	light	to	the	fact	that	the	values	for	the
equivalent	current	and	equivalent	voltage	are	values	that	can	be	identified	at	the
first	2	terminals	of	a	circuit.	It	is	important	to	note,	however,	that	such	a	case	is
only	possible	if	all	the	components	in	the	said	circuit	are	short-circuited.	If	the
components	are	not	short-circuited,	a	practical	solution	is	to	have	current	and
voltage	sources	replaced;	current	can	be	replaced	by	transforming	a	circuit	into	an
open	circuit,	and	voltage	can	be	replaced	by	transforming	a	circuit	into	a	short
circuit.
