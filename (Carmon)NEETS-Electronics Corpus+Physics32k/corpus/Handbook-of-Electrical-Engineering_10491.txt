For  a  given  situation  the  minimum  divided  attention
level should be established by the demands of the control
task. When divided attention conditions are present in com-
pensatory  situations  the  major  effects  on  the  control  per-
formance  are  reduced  crossover  frequency  and  increased
system  error.  To  a  ﬁrst  order  the  divided  attention  effects
on average crossover frequency are given in Fig. 105.5. Here
h
, the proportion of the total
the “control dwell fraction,” is 
time spent on the control task. There are many other com-
plications  and  considerations  [McRuer  et al.,  1990],  but
these require more than handbook treatment.
