Height is the measure of vertical distance, either how "tall" something or someone is, or how "high" the position is.
For example "The height of that building is 50 m" or "The height of an airplane is about 10,000 m".
When the term is used to describe how high something like an airplane or a mountain peak is from sea level, height is more often called altitude.
In a cartesian space, height is measured along the vertical axis (y) between a specific point and another that does not have the same y-value. If both points happen to have the same y-value, then their relative height equals to zero.
