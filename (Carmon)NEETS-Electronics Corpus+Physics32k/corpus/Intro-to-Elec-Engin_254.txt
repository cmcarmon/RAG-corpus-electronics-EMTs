For 4b/a2 < 1, from Equation (3.2.33) it is clear that both roots will be negative if a is
positive. For realistic circuits with positive values of RTh, L, and C, a will be positive, and
hence both roots will be negative. With s1 = −α1 and s2 = −α2 (where α1 and α2 are
positive numbers), the transient (natural) solution will be of the form
