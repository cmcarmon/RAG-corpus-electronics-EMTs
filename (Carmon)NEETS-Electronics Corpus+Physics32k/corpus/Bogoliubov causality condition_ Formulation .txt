In axiomatic quantum theory, S-matrix is considered as a functional of a function



g
:
M
→
[
0
,
1
]


{\displaystyle g:M\to [0,1]}
defined on the Minkowski space



M


{\displaystyle M}
. This function characterizes the intensity of the interaction in different space-time regions: the value



g
(
x
)
=
0


{\displaystyle g(x)=0}
at a point



x


{\displaystyle x}
corresponds to the absence of interaction in



x


{\displaystyle x}
,



g
(
x
)
=
1


{\displaystyle g(x)=1}
corresponds to the most intense interaction, and values between 0 and 1 correspond to incomplete interaction at



x


{\displaystyle x}
. For two points



x
,
y
∈
M


{\displaystyle x,y\in M}
, the notation



x
≤
y


{\displaystyle x\leq y}
means that



x


{\displaystyle x}
causally precedes



y


{\displaystyle y}
.
