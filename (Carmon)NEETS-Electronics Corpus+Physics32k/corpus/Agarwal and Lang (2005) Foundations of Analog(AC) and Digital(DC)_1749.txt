Since s1 and s2 are complex, the exponentials in Equation 12.121 are also
complex. To expose the resulting oscillatory and decaying behavior, we can
rewrite into a more intuitive form the homogeneous solution in Equation 12.121
using the complex notation for s1 and s2 as in Equation 12.127 and the
Euler relation:
