In order to decrease the time in which an island is detected, rate of change of frequency has been adopted as a detection method. The rate of change of frequency is given by the following expression:

G
H





{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} f}{\mathrm {d} t}}=ROCOF={\frac {\Delta Pf}{2GH}}}

where



f


{\displaystyle f}
is the system frequency,



t


{\displaystyle t}
is the time,



Δ
P


{\displaystyle \Delta P}
is the power imbalance (



Δ

P

m


−

P

e




{\displaystyle \Delta P=P_{m}-P_{e}}
),



G


{\displaystyle G}
is the system capacity, and



H


{\displaystyle H}
is the system inertia.
Should the rate of change of frequency, or ROCOF value, be greater than a certain value, the embedded generation will be disconnected from the network.
