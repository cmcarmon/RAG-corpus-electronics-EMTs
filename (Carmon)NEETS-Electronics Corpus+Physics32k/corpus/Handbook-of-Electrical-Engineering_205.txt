The Johns Hopkins scientists are among the ﬁrst to create a potentially practical battery in which both
of the electrodes and the electrolyte are made of polymers.  Fluoro-substituted thiophenes polymers have
been developed with potential differences of up to 2.9 volts, and with potential speciﬁc energy densities
of 30 to 75 watt hours/kg.
