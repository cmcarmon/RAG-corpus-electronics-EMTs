If the time delay is smaller than the PRI, the range deter-
mined by equation 10.2 is unambiguous. If the PRF is too high
or the PRI is too short, the echo pulses from the target might
arrive after the transmission of the next pulse, and then the
range measured might be ambiguous. The maximum unam-
biguous range is given by:
