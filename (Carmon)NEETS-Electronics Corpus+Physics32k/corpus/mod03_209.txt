The hook-on ac ammeter consists essentially of a current transformer with a split core and a rectifier-
type instrument connected to the secondary. The primary of the current transformer is the conductor
through which the current to be measured flows. The split core permits the instrument to be "hooked on"
the conductor without disconnecting it. Therefore, the current flowing through the conductor may be
measured safely and easily, as shown in figure 1-43.
