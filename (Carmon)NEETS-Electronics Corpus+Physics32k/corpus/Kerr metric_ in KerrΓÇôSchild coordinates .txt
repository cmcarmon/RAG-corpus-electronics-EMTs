The Kerr metric can be expressed in "Kerr–Schild" form, using a particular set of Cartesian coordinates as follows. These solutions were proposed by Kerr and Schild in 1965.

Notice that k is a unit vector. Here M is the constant mass of the spinning object, η is the Minkowski tensor, and a is a constant rotational parameter of the spinning object. It is understood that the vector






a
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {a}}}
is directed along the positive z-axis. The quantity r is not the radius, but rather is implicitly defined like this:

Notice that the quantity r becomes the usual radius R

when the rotational parameter a approaches zero. In this form of solution, units are selected so that the speed of light is unity (c = 1). At large distances from the source (R >> a), these equations reduce to the Eddington–Finkelstein form of the Schwarzschild metric.
In the Kerr–Schild form of the Kerr metric, the determinant of the metric tensor is everywhere equal to negative one, even near the source.
