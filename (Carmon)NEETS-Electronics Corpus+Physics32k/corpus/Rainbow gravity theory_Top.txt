Rainbow gravity (or "gravity's rainbow") is a theory that different wavelengths of light experience different gravity levels and are separated in the same way that a prism splits white light into the rainbow. This phenomenon would be imperceptible in areas of relatively low gravity, such as Earth, but would be significant in areas of extremely high gravity, such as a black hole. As such the theory claims to disprove that the universe has a beginning or Big Bang, as the big bang theory calls for all wavelengths of light to be impacted by gravity to the same extent. The theory was first proposed in 2003 by physicists Lee Smolin and Jo√£o Magueijo, and claims to bridge the gap between general relativity and quantum mechanics. Scientists are currently attempting to detect rainbow gravity using the Large Hadron Collider.
