The tinned surfaces to be joined should be shaped, fitted, and then mechanically joined to make a 
good mechanical and electrical contact. The parts must be held still. Any motion between the parts while 
the solder is cooling usually results in a poor solder connection, commonly called a "fractured solder" 
joint.
