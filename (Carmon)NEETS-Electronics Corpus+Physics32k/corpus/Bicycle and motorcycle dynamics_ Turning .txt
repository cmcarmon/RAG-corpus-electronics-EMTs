In order for a bike to turn, that is, change its direction of forward travel, the front wheel must aim approximately in the desired direction, as with any front-wheel steered vehicle. Friction between the wheels and the ground then generates the centripetal acceleration necessary to alter the course from straight ahead as a combination of cornering force and camber thrust. The radius of the turn of an upright (not leaning) bike can be roughly approximated, for small steering angles, by:




r
=


w

δ
cos
⁡

(
ϕ
)






{\displaystyle r={\frac {w}{\delta \cos \left(\phi \right)}}}

where



r




{\displaystyle r\,\!}
is the approximate radius,



w




{\displaystyle w\,\!}
is the wheelbase,



δ




{\displaystyle \delta \,\!}
is the steer angle, and



ϕ




{\displaystyle \phi \,\!}
is the caster angle of the steering axis.
