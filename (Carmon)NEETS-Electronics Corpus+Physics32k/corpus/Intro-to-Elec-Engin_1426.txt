An analog message is a continuum of possible amplitudes at any given time, and analog signals
are continuous in time and in amplitude, such as audio and video signals. When the message to
be sent over a communication system is analog, we refer to the system as analog. The transmitted
waveform must be some function of the message so that the receiver could decipher the message.
Usually the transmitted waveform is the result of varying either the amplitude, phase, or frequency
of a basic signal called a carrier. Combinations of amplitude, phase, and frequency variations are
also possible.
The carrier usually is sinusoidal of the form Ac cos (ωct+φc), where Ac, φc, and fc = ωc/2π
are the carrier’s amplitude, phase, and frequency, respectively. When A is varied as a linear function
of the message, amplitude modulation (AM) occurs. In phase modulation (PM) a phase term that
is a linear function of the message is added to the carrier. When the added phase is a linear function
of the integral of the message, the result is known as frequency modulation (FM). Note that the
carrier’s frequency in FM is a linear function of the message, because instantaneous angular
frequency is the time derivative of instantaneous phase. Thus, FM and PM are closely related.
