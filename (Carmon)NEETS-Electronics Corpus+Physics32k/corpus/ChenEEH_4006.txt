. A 1-D discrete fourier transform (DFT) (Dick, 1996)
systolic array of PE with coordinate rotation digital com-
puter (CORDIC) arithmetic is reported. Each PE con-
sumes about 44 conÔ¨Ågurable logic blocks (CLBs) of the
Xilinx XC4010PG191-4. As a result, each FPGA chip can
accommodate 10 PEs. With the operating 15.3-MHz
clock frequency, 1000-point 1-D DFT only takes 51.45 ms
to compute.
