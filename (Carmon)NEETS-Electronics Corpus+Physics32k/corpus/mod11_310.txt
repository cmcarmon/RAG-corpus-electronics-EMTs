The WAVEGUIDE-TYPE LENS is sometimes referred to as a conducting-type. It consists of 
several parallel concave metallic strips which are placed parallel to the electric field of the radiated energy 
fed to the lens, as shown in figure 3-10A and 3-10B. These strips act as waveguides in parallel for the 
incident (radiated) wave. The strips are placed slightly more than a half wavelength apart.
