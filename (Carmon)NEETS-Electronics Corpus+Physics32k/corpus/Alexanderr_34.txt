Dependent sources are useful in modeling elements such as transis-
tors, operational ampliÔ¨Åers, and integrated circuits. An example of a
current-controlled voltage source is shown on the right-hand side of
Fig.  1.14,  where  the  voltage 
of  the  voltage  source  depends  on
the  current  i through  element  C.  Students  might  be  surprised  that
the value  of  the dependent  voltage  source  is 
A)
because  it  is  a  voltage  source.  The  key  idea  to  keep  in  mind  is
that a voltage  source  comes  with  polarities 
in  its  symbol,
while a  current  source  comes  with  an  arrow,  irrespective  of  what  it
depends on.
