During the positive half-cycle of the input signal (solid line) in figure 1-21 view A, the top of the
transformer is positive with respect to ground. The dots on the transformer indicate points of the same
polarity. With this condition the diode is forward biased, the depletion region is narrow, the resistance of
the diode is low, and current flows through the circuit in the direction of the solid lines. When this current
flows through the load resistor, it develops a negative to positive voltage drop across it, which appears as
a positive voltage at the output terminal.
