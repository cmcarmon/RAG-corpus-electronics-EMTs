To test a circuit’s operation, it often helps to apply a known signal input 
to the circuit, and observe how the circuit behaves. You can use a function 
generator to create repeating‐signal AC waveforms in a variety of shapes and 
sizes — and apply the generated waveform to the input of the circuit you’re 
testing. Most function generators develop three kinds of waveforms: sine, 
triangle, and square. You can adjust the frequency of the waveforms from 
a low of between 0.2 Hz and 1 Hz to a high of between 2 MHz and 20 MHz. 
Some function generators come with a built‐in frequency counter so you can 
accurately time the waveforms you generate. You can also use a stand­alone 
frequency counter to fine‐tune the output of your function generator.
