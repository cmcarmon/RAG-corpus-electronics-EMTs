Transistors are semiconductor devices that usually 
 operate for long periods of time without failure. If a 
transistor does fail, excessively high temperature, 
 current, or voltage generally causes the failure.  Failure 
can also be caused by extreme mechanical stress. As a 
result of this electrical or mechanical abuse, a  transistor 
may open or short internally, or its  characteristics 
may alter enough to affect its operation. There are 
two methods for checking a transistor to determine 
whether it is functioning properly: with an ohmmeter 
and with a transistor tester.
