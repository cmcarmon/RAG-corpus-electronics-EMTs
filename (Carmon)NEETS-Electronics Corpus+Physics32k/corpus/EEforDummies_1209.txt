schematic and the sample breadboard in Figure 17-2.
As noted in Chapter 11, the pins on IC chips are numbered counter‐
clockwise, starting at the clocking notch. If you’ve placed the 555 timer 
IC with the clocking notch facing the left side of the board, the pin con-
nections are as shown in Figure 17-2.
Make sure you orient the polarized capacitor properly, with its negative 
side connected to ground.
