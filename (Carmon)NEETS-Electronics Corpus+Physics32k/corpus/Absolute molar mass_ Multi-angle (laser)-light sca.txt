MALS measurements work by calculating the amount of light scattered at each angle detected. The calculation is based on the intensity of light measured and the quantum efficiency of each detector. Then a model is used to approximate the intensity of light scattered at zero angle. The zero angle light scattered is then related to the molar mass.
As previously noted, the MALS detector can also provide information about the size of the molecule. This information is the Root Mean Square radius of the molecule (RMS or Rg). This is different from the Rh mentioned above who is taking the hydration layer into account. The purely mathematical root mean square radius is defined as the radii making up the molecule multiplied by the mass at that radius.
