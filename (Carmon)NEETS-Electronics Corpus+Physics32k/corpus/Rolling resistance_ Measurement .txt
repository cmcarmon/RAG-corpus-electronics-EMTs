There are at least two popular models for calculating rolling resistance.
"Rolling resistance coefficient (RRC). The value of the rolling resistance force divided by the wheel load. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has developed test practices to measure the RRC of tires. These tests (SAE J1269 and SAE J2452) are usually performed on new tires. When measured by using these standard test practices, most new passenger tires have reported RRCs ranging from 0.007 to 0.014." In the case of bicycle tires, values of 0.0025 to 0.005 are achieved. These coefficients are measured on rollers, with power meters on road surfaces, or with coast-down tests. In the latter two cases, the effect of air resistance must be subtracted or the tests performed at very low speeds.
The coefficient of rolling resistance b, which has the dimension of length, is approximately (due to the small-angle approximation of

) equal to the value of the rolling resistance force times the radius of the wheel divided by the wheel load.
ISO 18164:2005 is used to test rolling resistance in Europe.
The results of these tests can be hard for the general public to obtain as manufacturers prefer to publicize "comfort" and "performance".
