to
very modular objects with constant interfaces (even as the
object’s internal code changes), a GPS from one vendor may
be replaced by one from another vendor. As long as the
method call is not changed, no other object in the system
will have to be changed. Inheritance is reﬂected by the
methods that are present in the Sensor class and used by the
subclasses. In this example, you could deﬁne the methods
openPort(int value) and closePort(int value) in the super-
class where the argument is the number of the port to be
used. Even though these methods are not explicitly deﬁned
in the subclasses, the method call gps.openPort(int value) has
meaning because the GPS class inherits the method from
the superclass.
