b. The E layer limits are from about 55 to 90 miles. This layer is also known as the Kennelly-
Heaviside layer, because these two men were the first to propose its existence. The rate of ionic 
recombination in this layer is rather rapid after sunset and the layer is almost gone by midnight. 
This layer has the ability to refract signals as high as 20 megahertz. For this reason, it is valuable 
for communications in ranges up to about 1500 miles.
