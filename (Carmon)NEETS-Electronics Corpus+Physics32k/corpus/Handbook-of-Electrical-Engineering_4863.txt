Thick  ﬁlm  resistors  consist  of  a  conductive  phase,  e.g.,  rutile  (RuO2),  perovskite  (BaRuO3),  or  pyrochlore
(Pb2Ru2O7-x), and an insulating phase (e.g., lead borosilicate) dispersed in an organic vehicle. They are formed
by screen printing on a substrate, usually alumina, followed by sintering at »850oC for 10 min.
