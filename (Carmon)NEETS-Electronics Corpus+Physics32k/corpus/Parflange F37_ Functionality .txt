Flaring Technology
By flaring the pipe end, the flange gets a supporting surface and is able to build up force to ensure a stable connection.
At first, the insert has a sealing function. With its o-ring on the pipe end side, the sealing against the pipe is achieved. The sealing against the connecting part is done by the F37-Seal or a bonded seal. If the connecting part has a soft seal on the face side, an insert with a flat face has to be used. For the connection of two pipes, an insert with cones on both sides, which are soft sealed by o-rings, can be used as well.
Simultaneously, the insert stabilises the connection. The achieved pressure by tightening the flange bolts can be spread on a bigger contact surface of the insert, increasing the solidity of the connection.
Retaining Ring Technology
The special inside contour of the retaining ring flange covers the retaining ring, which is installed onto the machined pipe end. A form-closed connection results from the tightening of the flange, which will be sealed by bonded seal or pipe seal carrier on the face side.
