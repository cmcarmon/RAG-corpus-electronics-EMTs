Future VLSI DSP Systems
Future VLSI  systems  will  make  use  of  a  combination  of  many  types  of  architectures  such  as  dedicated  and
programmable.  These  systems  can  be  designed  successfully  with  proper  understanding  of  the  algorithms,
applications, theory of architectures, and with the use of advanced CAD systems.
