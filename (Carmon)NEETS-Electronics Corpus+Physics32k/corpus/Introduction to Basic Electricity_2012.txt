This chapter applies information from the last 
few chapters to the solving of all unknowns in these 
three basic types of circuits. Voltage dividers can 
make available several voltages from a single voltage 
source. Voltage dividers are essentially series circuits 
with  parallel loads. This chapter helps the student 
 understand how significant voltage dividers are as an 
application of series circuits and how to design one for 
a specific application.
