ONE RESCUER TECHNIQUE.Â—If a cardiac arrest is not witnessed, the rescuer must not assume 
that an arrest has occurred solely because the victim is lying on the floor and appears to be unconscious. 
First, try to arouse the victim. You can try shaking the victim's shoulders gently to obtain a response. 
Next, quickly check vital signs; if there is no response, apply artificial ventilation. Establish an open 
airway and ventilate the victim four times. Check the carotid (neck) pulse as shown in figure 1-1. If no 
pulse is felt and there are no visible signs of breathing, start CPR immediately.
