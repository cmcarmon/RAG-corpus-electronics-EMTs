The metal loss constant amet is usually obtained by assuming that the wall conductivity is high enough to
have only a negligible effect on the transverse properties of the modal ﬁeld patterns. Using this assumption,
the  power  loss  in  the  walls  per  unit  distance  along  the  waveguide  can  then  be  calculated  to  obtain  amet
[Marcuvitz, 1986]. Figure 37.15 shows the metal attenuation constants for several circular waveguide modes,
 and where m and s are the permeability
each normalized to the resistivity Rs of the walls, where Rs = 
and  conductivity  of  the  metal  walls,  respectively.  As  can  be  seen  from  this  ﬁgure,  the  TE0m  modes  exhibit
particularly low loss at frequencies signiﬁcantly above their cut-off frequencies, making them useful for trans-
porting microwave energy over large distances.
