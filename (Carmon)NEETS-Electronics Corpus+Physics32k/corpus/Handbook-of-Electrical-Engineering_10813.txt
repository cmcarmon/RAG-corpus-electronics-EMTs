The successful application of DFE to the design of electronic systems requires the coordination of several
design  and  data-based  activities,  such  as  environmental  impact  metrics;  data  and  data  management;  design
optimization,  including  cost  assessments;  and  others.  Failure  to  address  any  of  these  aspects  can  limit  the
effectiveness and usefulness of DFE efforts. Data and methodological deÔ¨Åciencies abound, and the challenge is
great, yet experience at world class companies such as AT&T, Digital, IBM, Motorola, Siemens Nixdorf, Volvo,
and  Xerox  indicate  that  it  can  be  done.  AT&T,  for  example,  is  testing  a  draft  DFE  practice;  baselining  the
environmental attributes of a telephone at different life cycle stages to determine where meaningful environmental
