7.3
Consider the series connection of a resistor and an inductor, as shown
in  Fig.  7.11.  Our  goal  is  to  determine  the  circuit  response,  which  we
will  assume  to  be  the  current 
through  the  inductor.  We  select  the
inductor current as the response in order to take advantage of the idea
that  the  inductor  current  cannot  change  instantaneously. At 
we
assume that the inductor has an initial current
