The Beam Index CRT
In the beam index tube, the RGB striped screen is intermixed with indexing stripes of a UV emitting luminescent
material with very fast decay time. When excited by the electron beam, the index stripes emit a light pulse that
is detected by photosensors located on the transparent bulb. The signals are then digitally processed, permitting
video signals to be Ô¨Åred at the correct position of the electron beam on the screen.
