Hypersonic International Flight Research and Experimentation (HIFiRE) is a joint program of the US Department of Defense and Australian DST Group. The "purpose of this program is to investigate fundamental hypersonic phenomena and accelerate the development of aerospace vehicle technologies deemed critical to long range precision strike" by using an "affordable, accessible, prototype experimentation strategy".
HIFiRE 0 May 7, 2009 - First HIFiRE hypersonic test flight
HIFiRE 1 March 22, 2010 - Second HIFiRE hypersonic test flight
HIFiRE 2 May 1, 2012 - Accelerating velocity profile hydrocarbon-fueled scramjet
