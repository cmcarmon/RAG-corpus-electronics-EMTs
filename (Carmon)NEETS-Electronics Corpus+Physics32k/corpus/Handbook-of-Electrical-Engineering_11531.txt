Summary
The  electrical  engineer  will  be  only  one  of  many  professionals  involved  in  the  implementation  of  a  hospital
information system. Successful participation in this team will depend on more than the electrical engineering
skills that are applicable to any information system project. The critical success factor is an understanding of
the hospitalâ€”the people (clinicians and administrators), their objectives (low cost and high quality), and the
environment within which they work.
