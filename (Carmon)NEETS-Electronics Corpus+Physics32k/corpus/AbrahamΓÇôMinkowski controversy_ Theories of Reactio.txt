At least one report from Britol et al. has suggested Minkowski's formulation, if correct, would provide the physical base for a reactionless drive, however a NASA report stated, "The signal levels are not sufficiently above the noise as to be conclusive proof of a propulsive effect."
Other work was conducted by the West Virginia Institute for Scientific Research (ISR) and was independently reviewed by the United States Air Force Academy, which concluded that there would be no expected net propulsive forces.
