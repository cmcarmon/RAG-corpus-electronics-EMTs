The emitter of the UJT can be viewed as the wiper arm of a variable resistor. If the voltage level on 
the emitter is more positive than the voltage gradient level at the emitter-base material contact point, the 
UJT is forward biased. The UJT will conduct heavily (almost a short circuit) from base 1 to the emitter. 
The emitter is fixed in position by the manufacturer. The level of the voltage gradient therefore depends 
upon the amount of bias voltage, as shown in figure 3-43.
