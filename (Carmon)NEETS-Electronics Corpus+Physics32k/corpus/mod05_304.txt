The results of this analysis are shown for voltage points 1 through 7 in figure 4-5. At point 1, the
magnetic field in coils 1-1A is maximum with polarities as shown. At the same time, negative voltages
are being felt in the 2-2A and 3-3A windings. These create weaker magnetic fields, which tend to aid the
1-1A field. At point 2, maximum negative voltage is being felt in the 3-3A windings. This creates a strong
magnetic field which, in turn, is aided by the weaker fields in 1-1A and 2-2A. As each point on the
voltage graph is analyzed, it can be seen that the resultant magnetic field is rotating in a clockwise
direction. When the three-phase voltage completes one full cycle (point 7), the magnetic field has rotated
through 360ยบ .
