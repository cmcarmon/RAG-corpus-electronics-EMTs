Figure 29.1(b) shows a typical pole plot for the ﬁfth-order VTF produced by this circuit. Figure 29.1(c) gives

.  The  LCR  low-pass  ladder  structure  of  Fig.  29.1(a)  can  be  altered  to  higher  or
lower order simply by adding or subtracting reactances, preserving the series-inductor/shunt-capacitor pattern.
In general terms, the higher the ﬁlter order, the greater the selectivity.
