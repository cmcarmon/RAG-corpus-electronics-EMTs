The  signal  is  applied  to  the  base  terminal  of  the 
transistor  via  a  coupling  capacitor,  C1.  This 
capacitor removes the d.c. component of any signal 
applied to the input terminals and ensures that the 
base bias current delivered by R1 is unaffected by 
any device connected to the input. C2 couples the 
signal out of the stage and also prevents d.c. current 
flowing appearing at the output terminals.  
 
In order to stabilize the operating conditions for 
the stage and compensate for variations in transistor 
parameters, base bias current for the transistor can 
be  derived  from  the  voltage  at  the  collector  (see 
Fig.  7.32).  This  voltage  is  dependent  on  the 
collector  current  which,  in  turn,  depends  upon  the 
base current. A negative feedback loop thus exists 
in which there is a degree of self-regulation. If the 
collector  current  increases,  the  collector  voltage 
will fall and the base current will be reduced. The
