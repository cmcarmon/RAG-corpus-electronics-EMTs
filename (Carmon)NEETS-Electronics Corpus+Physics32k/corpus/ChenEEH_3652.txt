Since the vocal-tract shape is varied as a function of time to
produce desired speech sounds, so must the spectral properties
of the speech signal be time-varying. In contemporary SP, it is
possible to exhibit these changes using a three-dimensional
plot of magnitude spectra over time (sometimes called a
‘‘waterfall plot’’) This information was historically gleaned
