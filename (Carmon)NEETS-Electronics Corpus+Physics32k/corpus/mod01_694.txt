Carbon dioxide (CO2) is used in fighting electrical fires. It is nonconductive and, therefore, the safest
to use in terms of electrical safety. It also offers the least likelihood of damaging equipment. However, if
the discharge horn of a CO2 extinguisher is allowed to accidentally touch an energized circuit, the horn
may transmit a shock to the person handling the extinguisher.
