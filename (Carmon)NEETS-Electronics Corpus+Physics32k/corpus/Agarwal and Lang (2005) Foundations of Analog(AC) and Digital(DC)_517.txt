By the first step of the Th√©venin method, the voltage vTH is given by the open-circuit
voltage of the network at the aa
port. The open-circuit voltage is the voltage at the
aa
network port when there is no external circuit element connected across the port.
(Note that the 2- resistor is internal to the network and should not be disconnected.)
Figure 3.57a shows this situation. The open-circuit voltage that would be measured at
(cid:3)
the aa
