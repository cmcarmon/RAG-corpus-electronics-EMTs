DAMPINGÂ—(1) The process of smoothing out oscillations. (2) In a meter, this process is used to keep the 
pointer of the meter from overshooting the correct reading [3]. (3) A mechanical or electrical technique 
used in synchro receivers to prevent the rotor from oscillating or spinning. Damping is also used in 
servosystems to minimize overshoot of the load [15] [16].
