A standard 1/2-inch tape may have either seven (fig. 2-13, view A) or nine tracks (fig. 2-13, view B) 
of data stored on it, depending upon the particular read/write heads installed in the tape unit. Read/write 
heads are usually designed to read (or write) data (in the form of bits) concurrently across the width of the 
tape.
