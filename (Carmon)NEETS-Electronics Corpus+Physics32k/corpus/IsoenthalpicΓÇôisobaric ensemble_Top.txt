The isoenthalpic-isobaric ensemble (constant enthalpy and constant pressure ensemble) is a statistical mechanical ensemble that maintains constant enthalpy



H



{\displaystyle H\,}
and constant pressure



P



{\displaystyle P\,}
applied. It is also called the



N
p
H


{\displaystyle NpH}
-ensemble, where the number of particles



N



{\displaystyle N\,}
is also kept as a constant. It was developed by physicist H. C. Andersen in 1980. The ensemble adds another degree of freedom, which represents the variable volume



V



{\displaystyle V\,}
of a system to which the coordinates of all particles are relative. The volume



V



{\displaystyle V\,}
becomes a dynamical variable with potential energy and kinetic energy given by



P
V



{\displaystyle PV\,}
. The enthalpy



H

P
V



{\displaystyle H=E+PV\,}
is a conserved quantity.
