When sid has occurred, examination of the sun has revealed a bright solar eruption. All stations lying 
wholly, or in part, on the sunward side of the Earth are affected. The solar eruption produces an unusually 
intense burst of ultraviolet light, which is not absorbed by the F2, F1, and E layers, but instead causes a 
sudden abnormal increase in the ionization density of the D layer. As a result, frequencies above 1 or 2 
megahertz are unable to penetrate the D layer and are usually completely absorbed by the layer.
