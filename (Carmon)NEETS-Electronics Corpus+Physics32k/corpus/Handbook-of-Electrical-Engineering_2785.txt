Given the wide range of lengths of signal interconnections, all three models above are relevant; the lumped RC
model suitable for short interconnections, the distributed RC model for low-to-moderate speed signals on longer-
length interconnections, and the distributed RLC model for high-speed signals on longer interconnections.
