A little reflection will show that the law of the equality of the inertial and gravitational mass is equivalent to the assertion that the acceleration imparted to a body by a gravitational field is independent of the nature of the body. For Newton's equation of motion in a gravitational field, written out in full, it is:
(Inertial mass)



⋅


{\displaystyle \cdot }
(Acceleration)



=


{\displaystyle =}
(Intensity of the gravitational field)



⋅


{\displaystyle \cdot }
(Gravitational mass).
It is only when there is numerical equality between the inertial and gravitational mass that the acceleration is independent of the nature of the body.
