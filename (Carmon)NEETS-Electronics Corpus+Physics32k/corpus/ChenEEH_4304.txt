Optical networks began with wavelength division multiplex-
ing (WDM), which arose to provide additional capacity on
existing ﬁbers. The components of the optical network are
deﬁned according to how the wavelengths are transmitted,
groomed, or implemented in the network. Viewing the network
from a layered approach, the optical network requires the ad-
dition of an optical layer. To help deﬁne network functionality,
networks are divided into several different physical or virtual
layers. The ﬁrst layer, the services layer, is where the services—
such as data trafﬁc—enter the telecommunications network. The
next layer, SONET, provides restoration, performance monitor-
ing, and provisioning that is transparent to the ﬁrst layer.
