This section does not contain a discussion of such tech-
niques, but some observations are presented. It should be
noted that
information is assumed
known (as is the case in standard identiﬁcation techniques),
then system identiﬁcation does not supply any information on
the system structure or the types or values of components. In
such cases, the component connection model cannot be used.
In many applications, however, connection information and
component type information are available. In such cases, the
component connection model may be applicable. Indeed, for
identiﬁcation schemes using random inputs, it is easily shown
that the component correlation functions and the overall
system correlation functions are related by:
