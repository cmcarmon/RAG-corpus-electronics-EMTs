For the purpose of test pattern (i.e., input stimulus) generation it is often assumed that the circuit under test
(CUT) is either fault-free or it contains only one node which is permanently stuck at a particular logic state.
Thus, the most widely used fault model is the so-called single stuck-at fault model. Using this model each fault
is tested by applying a speciÔ¨Åc test pattern that, in a good circuit, drives the particular node to the logic state
which has the opposite value from the state of the fault assumed to be present in the faulty circuit. For example,
to test if node v is stuck at logic state x (denoted by v/x or v-x), a test pattern must be used that would cause
node v to be driven to the opposite of logic state x if the circuit is not faulty. Thus, the test pattern attempts
to show that node v is not stuck at x by driving the node to a value other than x, which for a two-valued digital
circuit must be the opposite of x (denoted by ~x). This leads to the requirement that to detect any stuck-at
fault v/x, it is necessary to be able to control the logic value at node v so that it can be set to ~v. If the signal
value at node v can be observed directly by connecting it to a test equipment, the particular fault v/x can be
detected  readily.  However,  in  most  cases,  node  v  may  be  an  internal  node,  which  is  inaccessible  for  direct
