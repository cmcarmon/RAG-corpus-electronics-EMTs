Serial Ink-Jet Printing
Ink-jet  technologies  have  evolved  over  the  last  two  decades  with  continuous  ink-jet  being  the  ﬁrst  to  be
developed, followed by piezoelectric and then thermal or bubble-jet technologies. All three have been commer-
cialized,  although  bubble-jet  is  by  far  the  most  popular  today  and  continuous  ink-jet  is  used  primarily  for
speciality page printer or high-quality color graphics and image applications. Both piezoelectric and bubble-
jet  are  “drop-on-demand”  or  “impulse”  technologies,  i.e.,  a  drop  is  ejected  from  the  printhead  only  when
desired. With continuous ink-jet, a continuous stream of droplets is generated by the printhead and undesired
drops are deﬂected electrostatically away from the paper (or vice versa). Ink requirements for these technologies
are very demanding and the development of appropriate inks is as important (and difﬁcult) as the development
of the printer and printhead hardware. Demands on the ink are both extensive and conﬂicting, and include
the requirements of nonclogging in the nozzle but fast dry time on the paper, water-based but water-resistant
after  drying  on  the  paper,  and  quality  printing  on  a  wide  range  of  papers  (requires  minimal  feathering  and
controlled spot size). Nonaqueous solid inks have also been used; the ink is solid at room temperature but is
liquid at an elevated head temperature.
