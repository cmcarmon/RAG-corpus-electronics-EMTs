The PT IGBT has a thin drift region and better on-state
performance than NPT IGBT. High gain of the pnp transistor
can lead to potential thyristor latch-up. For this reason, PT
IGBT is subjected to lifetime control techniques to reduce the
gain of the bipolar transistor. On the other hand, NPT IGBT
has a wide drift region, and the gain is low even without
lifetime control. Low lifetime and thin drift region make the
PT IGBT more sensitive to temperature variation than NPT
IGBT. Further, being bipolar in nature, IGBTs are vulnerable to
thermal runaway in certain conditions, depending on the
relative importance of MOSFET and bipolar transistor param-
eters. Hence, paralleling IGBTs is a challenge. The delay in
turn-on and current tail during turn-off are signiÔ¨Åcant sources
of power loss in an IGBT. Several structures have been
designed for faster removal of charge from the drift region
during turn-off. Controlling the carrier lifetime within a
tightly controlled band in the drift region has also been used
to obtain a better turn-off between conduction and switching
characteristics.
