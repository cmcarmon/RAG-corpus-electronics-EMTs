k

B




{\displaystyle k_{B}}
is the Boltzmann constant




W


{\displaystyle W}
is the mean molecular weight




H


{\displaystyle H}
is the mass of the proton




T


{\displaystyle T}
is the temperature of the star




σ


{\displaystyle \sigma }
is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant




c


{\displaystyle c}
is the speed of light
The equation for equilibrium of the star requires a balance between the pressure force and gravitational force
