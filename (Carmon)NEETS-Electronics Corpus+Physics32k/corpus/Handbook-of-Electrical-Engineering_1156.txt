Finite impulse response (FIR) ﬁlter: A ﬁlter whose output in response to a unit impulse function is identically
zero  after  a  given  bounded  number  of  samples. A  FIR  ﬁlter  is  deﬁned  by  a  linear  constant-coefﬁcient
difference equation in which the output depends only on the present and previous sample values of the
input.
