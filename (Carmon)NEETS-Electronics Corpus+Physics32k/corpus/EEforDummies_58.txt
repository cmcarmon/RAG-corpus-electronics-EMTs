Think of a bucket brigade: You have a line of people, each holding a bucket 
of water, with a person at one end filling an empty bucket with water, and 
a person at the other end dumping a full bucket out. On command, each 
person passes his bucket to his neighbor on the right, and accepts a bucket 
from his neighbor on the left. Although each bucket moves just a short dis-
tance (from one person to the next), it appears as if a bucket of water is being 
transported from one end of the line to the other. Likewise, with electric cur-
rent, as each electron displaces the one in front of it along a conductive path, 
it appears as if the electrons are moving nearly instantaneously from one end 
of the conductor to the other. (See Figure 1-4.)
