Given the same set of rules, forward chaining can also be
applied to derive new conclusions from given data. For
example, the algorithm of forward chaining with breadth-
ﬁrst search is as follows: Compare the content of the working
memory with the premises of each rule in the rule base using
the ordering of the rules. If the data in the working memory
match a rule’s premises, the conclusion is placed in the
working memory, and the control moves to the next rule.
Once all rules have been considered, the control starts again
from the beginning of the rule sets.
