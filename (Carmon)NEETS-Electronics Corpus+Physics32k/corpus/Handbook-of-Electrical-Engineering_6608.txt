We can provide connectivity among users in three dimensions: space, time, and optical frequency or wave-
length, employing space-division multiplexing (SDM), optical time-division multiplexing (OTDM), and optical
frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) or wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM), respectively. To control
the path routing we need optical switches for OTDM and frequency routing technology for OFDM. At present,
network  architectures  and  protocols  are  at  the  research  stage.  We  mention  some  of  these  components  and
switches in the following paragraphs. More details can be found in the References [Miller and Kaminow, 1988;
Special Issue, 1990].
