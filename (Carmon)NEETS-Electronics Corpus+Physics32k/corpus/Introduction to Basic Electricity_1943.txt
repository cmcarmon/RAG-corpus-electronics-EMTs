If the pointer of the meter rests between the major 
divisions of the scale, the smaller divisions are read. 
Figure 15-19 shows four small lines between each ma-
jor division of the scale, creating five equally spaced 
intervals. Each of these small intervals represents one-
fifth of the major interval, or 0.2 units.
