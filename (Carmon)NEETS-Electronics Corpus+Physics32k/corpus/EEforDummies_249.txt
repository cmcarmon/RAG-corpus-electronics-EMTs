A single ohm is so small a unit of resistance that you’re likely to see 
 resistance measured in larger quantities, such as kilohms (kilo + ohm),  
which is thousands of ohms and is abbreviated kΩ, or megohms  
(mega + ohm), which is millions of ohms and is abbreviated MΩ. So  
1 kΩ = 1,000 Ω and 1 MΩ = 1,000,000 Ω.
