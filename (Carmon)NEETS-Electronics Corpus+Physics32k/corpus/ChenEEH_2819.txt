Most theoretical techniques for modeling ELF/VLF propa-
gation in the earth-ionosphere waveguide are based on
frequency-domain waveguide mode theory. However, these
techniques cannot account for arbitrary horizontal as well as
vertical geometrical and electrical
inhomogeneities of the
ionosphere, continents, and oceans. Recently, Simpson and
Taﬂove (2002, 2004) and Otsuyama et al. (2003) have de-
veloped two- and three-dimensional FDTD models of impul-
sive ELF propagation around the entire surface of the earth.
Periodic boundary conditions are used in conjunction with a
latitude-longitude grid that wraps around the complete earth-
sphere. These models have been veriﬁed by numerical studies
of
frequency-dependent propagation attenuation with dis-
tance, antipodal propagation, and the Schumann resonance.
Figure 9.14 visualizes the results of one such model (Simpson
and Taﬂove [2004]) which illustrates the propagation com-
pletely around the Earth of an ELF electromagnetic pulse
generated by a vertical lightning stroke off the coast of South
America. In this model, all features of the lithosphere and
ionosphere located within 100 km of sea level are modeled
with a resolution of approximately 40  40  5 km.
