Voltage  and  current  sources  can  be  independent  or  dependent.  Their  respective 
circuit  symbols  are  shown  in  Figure  1.8.  Independent  sources  are  usually  shown  as  a 
circle  while  dependent  sources  are  usually  shown  as  a  diamond-shape.  Independent 
sources can have a DC output or a functional output; some examples are a sine wave, 
square wave, impulse, and linear ramp. Dependent sources can be used to implement a 
voltage  or  current  which  is  a  function  of  some  other  voltage  or  current  in  the  circuit. 
Dependent  sources  are  often  used  to  model  active  circuits  that  are  used  for  signal 
amplification.
