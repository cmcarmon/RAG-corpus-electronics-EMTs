Plot the magnitude and phase curves on both log and linear scales for those element
values. Also, keeping the resonance frequency and the peak magnitude constant, show
frequency response plots for Q = 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16.
As worked in Example 14.1, the transfer function for the circuit in Figure 14.9 written
in standard form is
