Many multimeters include an audible continuity‐testing feature. By turning the 
meter’s selector to continuity or tone, you can hear a beep whenever the meter 
detects continuity in a wire or connection. If the wire or connection doesn’t 
have continuity, the meter stays silent. The tone gives you a convenient way to 
check an entire circuit without having to keep your eye on the meter.
