Along with bonding type and atomic radii, metallic crystalline structures are also dependent on a quantum-mechanical mechanism. Unlike other crystals, in a metallically bonded solid, the electrons move freely throughout the solid, which are held in the solid by their attraction to the positively charged nuclei. A Schr√∂dinger equation is used to display the wave function of electrons, which is dependent on the quantum numbers n and l, along with a constant, the Bohr radius, and the distance of the electrons from an ion core. It can also be shown from the probability density of an electron, that the electrons in a metallic solid are generally closer to the ionic cores than they were as individual atoms. This causes a decrease in the potential energy of the electrons. However, the assembly of the solid structure also confines the electrons to a smaller space than that in which they normally operate. This results in an increase in the kinetic energy of the electrons. The stability of the structure is a result of the fact that the decrease in potential energy is much more drastic than the increase in kinetic energy. The larger the atomic radius of an atom, the greater the decrease in potential energy will be when the metal solid is formed. Also, the fewer valence electrons an atom has, the smaller the increase in kinetic energy will be. Together these trends explain the observation that elements to the left and lower down the periodic table are more likely to be metals.
