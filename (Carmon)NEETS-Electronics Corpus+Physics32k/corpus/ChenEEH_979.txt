Step 8. The actual clock delays to the individual registers are
calculated by traversing the spanning tree (basis) of
the circuit graph. The clock delay of the Ô¨Årst register is
arbitrarily chosen (zero in this implementation). As
the spanning tree is traversed, additional vertices ad-
jacent to the current vertex are visited. The clock delay
of the visited vertex is determined trivially because
both the clock delay of the current vertex and the
clock skew of the edge between the current and visited
vertex are known.
