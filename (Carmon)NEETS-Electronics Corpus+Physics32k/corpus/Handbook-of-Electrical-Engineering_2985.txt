where  the  ﬁrst  term  on  the  right-hand  side  represents  the  depletion  component  and  the  second  term  is  the
diffusion component of Cp. In Eq. (28.4), t
f is the average forward transit time of minority carriers in the ﬁeld-
neutral base, CJE is the zero bias value of emitter-base junction depletion capacitance, VJE is the built-in potential
of the junction, VE is the forward biasing voltage developed across the intrinsic emitter-base junction, and MJE is
the grading coefﬁcient of the junction. The capacitance, Cm, has only a depletion component, owing to the reverse
