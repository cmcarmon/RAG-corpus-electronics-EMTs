Determining the square of the function f (t ), then ﬁnding the mean (average) value, and ﬁnally
taking the square root yields the rms value, known as effective value. This concept will be seen
to be useful in comparing the effectiveness of different sources in delivering power to a resistor.
The effective value of a periodic current, for example, is a constant, or dc value, which delivers
the same average power to a resistor, as will be seen later.
