The relay is one of the most dependable electromechanical devices in use, but like any other
mechanical or electrical device, relays occasionally wear out or become inoperative. Should an inspection
determine that a relay is defective, the relay should be removed immediately and replaced with another of
the same type. You should be sure to obtain the same type relay as a replacement. Relays are rated in
voltage, amperage, type of service, number of contacts, and similar characteristics.
