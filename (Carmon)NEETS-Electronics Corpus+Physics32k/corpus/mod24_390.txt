In shipboard applications, the Navy recommends using the rotary splice. The rotary splice is a low-
loss mechanical splice that provides stable environmental and mechanical performance in the Navy
environment. Stable performance means that splice loss does not vary significantly with changes in
temperature or other environmental or mechanical conditions. Completing a rotary splice also requires
only a small amount of training, or expertise. This shorter training time is another reason why the Navy
recommends using the rotary splice over other mechanical or fusion splicing techniques.
