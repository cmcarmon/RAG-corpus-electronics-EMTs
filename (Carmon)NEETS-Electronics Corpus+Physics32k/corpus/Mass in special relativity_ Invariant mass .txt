The invariant mass is the ratio of four-momentum (the four-dimensional generalization of classical momentum) to four-velocity:





p

μ


=
m

v

μ





{\displaystyle p^{\mu }=mv^{\mu }\,}

and is also the ratio of four-acceleration to four-force when the rest mass is constant. The four-dimensional form of Newton's second law is:





F

μ


=
m

A

μ


.


{\displaystyle F^{\mu }=mA^{\mu }.}
