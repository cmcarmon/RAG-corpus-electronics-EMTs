First, the SNR is stated in three ways. You’ll see it as (1) root-mean-square (RMS) signal-to-RMS
noise, (2) peak-to-peak signal-to-RMS noise, or (3) peak signal-to-RMS noise. If the SNR specification
doesn’t state which way it was measured, you could be mislead. For example, a 25-dB RMS SNR is equal
to a 34-dB peak-to-peak signal-to-RMS noise ratio, or a 28-dB peak signal-to-RMS noise ratio.
