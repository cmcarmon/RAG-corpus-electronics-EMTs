Bode plots are easily sketched by making asymptotic ap-
proximations ﬁrst. The frequency response function H(jv) is a
rational function, and the numerator and denominator are
factorized into ﬁrst-order terms and second-order terms with
complex roots. The factors are then written in the standard
form as follows:
