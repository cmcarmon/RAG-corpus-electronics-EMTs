The value of Gauss' constant, exactly as he derived it, had been used since Gauss' time because it was held to be a fundamental constant, as described above. The solar mass, mean solar day and sidereal year with which Gauss defined his constant are all slowly changing in value. If modern values were inserted into the defining equation, a value of 0.01720209789 would result. Such would be of little use unless the entire system of constants was changed to reflect the new gravitational constant.
It is also possible to set the gravitational constant, the mass of the Sun, and the astronomical unit to 1. This defines a unit of time with which the period of the resulting orbit is equal to 2Ï€. These are often called canonical units. More on such conversions can be found at the Gravitational constant article.
