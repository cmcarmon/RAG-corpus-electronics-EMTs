The circulating balls travel inside the thread form of the screw and nut, and balls are recirculated through various types of return mechanisms. If the ball nut did not have a return mechanism the balls would fall out of the end of the ball nut when they reached the end of the nut. For this reason several different recirculation methods have been developed.
An external ballnut employs a stamped tube which picks up balls from the raceway by use of a small pick up finger. Balls travel inside of the tube and are then replaced back in the thread raceway.
An internal button ballnut employs a machined or cast button style return which allows balls to exit the raceway track and move one thread then reenter the raceway.
An endcap return ballnut employs a cap on the end of the ball nut. The cap is machined to pick up balls out of the end of the nut and direct them down holes which are bored transversely down the ballnut. The complement cap on the other side of the nut directs balls back into the raceway.
