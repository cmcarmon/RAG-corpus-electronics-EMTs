How can the cardinal series interpolate uniquely the
bandlimited signal from which the samples were taken?
Could not the same samples be generated from another
bandlimited  signal?  The  answer  is  no.  Bandlimited
functions  are  smooth.  Any  behavior  deviating  from
smooth  would  result  in  high-frequency  components
which in turn invalidates the required property of being
bandlimited.  The  smoothness  of  the  signal  between
samples  precludes  arbitrary  variation  of  the  signal
there.
