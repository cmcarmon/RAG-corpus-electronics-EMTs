The value of vC at time t = t0+ 2t can be determined in like manner from the
value of vC(t0 + t) and i(t0 + t). Subsequent values of vC can be determined
using the same process. By choosing small enough values of t, a computer
can determine the waveform for vC(t) to an arbitrary degree of accuracy. This
process illustrates the fact that the initial state contains all the information that is
necessary to determine the entire future behavior of the system from the initial
state and the subsequent input.
