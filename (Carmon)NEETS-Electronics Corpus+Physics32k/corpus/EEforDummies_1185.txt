If your multimeter has a diode‐checking feature, you can test a diode by 
attaching the red test lead to the anode (positive terminal) of the diode, 
and the black lead to the cathode (negative terminal). You should get a fairly 
low, but not zero, reading (for instance, 0.5). Then reverse the leads and 
you should get an overrange reading. If you get two zero readings or two 
 overrange readings, chances are your diode is bad (that is, shorted out or 
open).
