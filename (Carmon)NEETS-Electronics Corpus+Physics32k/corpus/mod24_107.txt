The basic optical property of a material, relevant to optical fibers, is the index of refraction. The
index of refraction (n) measures the speed of light in an optical medium. The index of refraction of a
material is the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed of light in the material itself. The speed
of light (c) in free space (vacuum) is 3 · 108 meters per second (m/s). The speed of light is the frequency
(f) of light multiplied by the wavelength of light (ÿ). When light enters the fiber material (an optically
dense medium), the light travels slower at a speed (v). Light will always travel slower in the fiber material
than in air. The index of refraction is given by:
