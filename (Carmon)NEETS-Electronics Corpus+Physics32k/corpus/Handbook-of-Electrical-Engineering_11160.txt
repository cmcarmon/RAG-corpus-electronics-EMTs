The electrochemical cell is completed by the silver anode. The reaction at the anode involves forming the
low-solubility salt, silver-chloride, from the anode material itself and the chloride ion contained in the electro-
lyte.  The  cell  is  designed  so  that  these  materials  are  also  in  abundance  so  that  their  concentration  does  not
