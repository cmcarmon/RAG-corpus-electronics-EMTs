Three fundamental requirements of a military communications system are reliability, security, and  
speed. Reliability is always first. Security and speed are next in importance and, depending on the stage of 
an operation, are interchangeable. During the planning phase, security is more important than speed. 
During the execution phase, speed sometimes passes security in importance.
