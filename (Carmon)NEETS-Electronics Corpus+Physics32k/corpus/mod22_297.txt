Flowcharting is one method of pictorially representing a procedural (step-by-step) solution to a 
problem before you actually start to write the computer instructions required to produce the desired 
results. Flowcharts use different shaped symbols connected by one-way arrows to represent operations, 
data flow, equipment, and so forth.
