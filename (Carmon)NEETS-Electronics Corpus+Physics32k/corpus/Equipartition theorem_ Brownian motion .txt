The equipartition theorem can be used to derive the Brownian motion of a particle from the Langevin equation. According to that equation, the motion of a particle of mass m with velocity v is governed by Newton's second law

{\displaystyle {\frac {d\mathbf {v} }{dt}}={\frac {1}{m}}\mathbf {F} =-{\frac {\mathbf {v} }{\tau }}+{\frac {1}{m}}\mathbf {F} _{\mathrm {rnd} },}

where Frnd is a random force representing the random collisions of the particle and the surrounding molecules, and where the time constant τ reflects the drag force that opposes the particle's motion through the solution. The drag force is often written Fdrag = −γv; therefore, the time constant τ equals m/γ.
The dot product of this equation with the position vector r, after averaging, yields the equation

for Brownian motion (since the random force Frnd is uncorrelated with the position r). Using the mathematical identities

The above differential equation for

{\displaystyle \langle r^{2}\rangle ={\frac {6k_{\rm {B}}T\tau ^{2}}{m}}\left(e^{-t/\tau }-1+{\frac {t}{\tau }}\right).}

On small time scales, with t << τ, the particle acts as a freely moving particle: by the Taylor series of the exponential function, the squared distance grows approximately quadratically:

{\displaystyle \langle r^{2}\rangle \approx {\frac {3k_{\rm {B}}T}{m}}t^{2}=\langle v^{2}\rangle t^{2}.}

However, on long time scales, with t >> τ, the exponential and constant terms are negligible, and the squared distance grows only linearly:

{\displaystyle \langle r^{2}\rangle \approx {\frac {6k_{B}T\tau }{m}}t={\frac {6k_{B}Tt}{\gamma }}.}

This describes the diffusion of the particle over time. An analogous equation for the rotational diffusion of a rigid molecule can be derived in a similar way.
