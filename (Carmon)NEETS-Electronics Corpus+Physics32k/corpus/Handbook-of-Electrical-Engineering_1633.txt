In this sense we call the conditional joint probability density function f(x n*qm) as likelihood function  l(qm).
The likelihood function l(qm) is a deterministic function of the parameter vector qm once the observed variables
x1, …, xn are inserted. This means that qm is variable and the sample vector xn is ﬁxed, while the conditional
joint probability density function is considered as a function of the observation vector  xn with qm ﬁxed. The
maximum likelihood estimator of qm is that value of the parameter vector for which the likelihood function is
maximized.
