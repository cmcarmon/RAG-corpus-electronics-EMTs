Both organic and inorganic PC materials are used (see Fig. 89.24). A variety of charge-generation and charge-
transport material systems have been developed for organic PCs; most use separate layers for charge generation
and charge transport. Examples of efﬁcient organic charge-generation materials sensitive at both GaAlAs (7800
Å) and HeNe (6328 Å) wavelengths include squarylium and thiopyridium dyes in an appropriate binder layer
(»0.5 mm thick). The charge-transport layer (CTL) consists of a thicker layer (20–30 mm) of a charge-transport
