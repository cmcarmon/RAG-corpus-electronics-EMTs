One problem with both the single- and dual-gate MOSFETs is that the oxide layer between gate and 
channel can be destroyed very easily by ordinary static electricity. Replacement MOSFETs come 
packaged with their leads shorted together by a special wire loop or spring to avoid accidental damage. 
The rule to remember with these shorting springs is that they must not be removed until after the 
MOSFET has been soldered or plugged into a circuit. One such spring is shown in figure 3-58.
