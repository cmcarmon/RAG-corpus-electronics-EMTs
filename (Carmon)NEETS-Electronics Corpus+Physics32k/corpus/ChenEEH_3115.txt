There are two basic tests used to obtain machine parameters.
These are the no-load test and the locked rotor test. In the no-
load test, the motor is run at rated voltage with no mechanical
load attached. In this case, the slip is approximately zero, and
very little current circulates on the rotor. There is a small
amount of mechanical power required, enough to overcome
friction and windage losses. Assuming that the rotor current is
negligible, then, referring to the equivalent circuit, the stator
current circulates in the mutual branch representing the exci-
tation current. The stator resistance is measured independently
with a bridge. The stator voltage, current, and power are
measured. Since the stator resistance is known, the stator
winding losses, 3I 2
1 rs, can be subtracted from the input
power. The remaining losses are associated with the core loss
and mechanical losses. The total reactance XNL ¼ X1 þ Xm is
now found as follows:
