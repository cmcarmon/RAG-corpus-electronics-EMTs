In the single-swing, blocking-oscillator synchronizer, shown in view C of figure 2-2, a free-running,
single-swing blocking oscillator is generally used as the master oscillator. The advantage of the single-
swing blocking oscillator is that it generates sharp trigger pulses without additional shaping circuitry.
Timing trigger pulses of only one polarity are obtained by means of a limiter.
