Field theories had been used with great success in understanding the electromagnetic field and the strong force, but by around 1960 all attempts to create a gauge invariant theory for the weak force (and its combination with fundamental force electromagnetism, the electroweak interaction) had consistently failed, with gauge theories thereby starting to fall into disrepute as a result. The problem was that the symmetry requirements in gauge theory predicted that both electromagnetism's gauge boson (the photon) and the weak force's gauge bosons (W and Z) should have zero mass. Although the photon is indeed massless, experiments show that the weak force's bosons have mass. This meant that either gauge invariance was an incorrect approach, or something else – unknown – was giving these particles their mass, but all attempts to suggest a theory able to solve this problem just seemed to create new theoretical issues.
In the late 1950s, physicists had "no idea" how to resolve these issues, which were significant obstacles to developing a full-fledged theory for particle physics.
