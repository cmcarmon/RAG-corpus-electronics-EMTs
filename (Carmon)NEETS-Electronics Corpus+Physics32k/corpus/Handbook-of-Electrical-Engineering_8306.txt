observation from outside the component package. In that case, it is necessary to create a condition where the
value of the signal on an externally observable node, say node  t, will be different for each of the two possible
values that node v can take on, that is, node t shall be driven to logic state y or ~y depending upon whether
node v is at logic state x or ~x, respectively. Note that x and y may represent the same or different logic states.
The external pins of a component are the only means of applying the stimuli and observing the behavior of
that  component.  During  testing,  a  test  pattern  is  used  as  the  stimulus  to  detect  the  presence  of  a  particular
fault by causing at least one output pin of the component to take on a different value depending upon whether
the targeted fault is present or not. Thus, a test pattern is used for controlling the circuit’s nodes so that the
presence of a fault on a circuit node can be observed on at least one of the circuit’s external pins. Solving the
dual problems of controllability and observability is the primary objective of all test methods. The logic-to-pin
ratio of a digital circuit is a relative measure of the ratio of possible faults in the circuit to the number of signal
pins (i.e., not including the constant power/ground pins) of that component. A large-value logic-to-pin ratio
implies that logic states of a large number of circuit nodes must be controlled using a small number of external
pins. As  a  result,  conﬂicting  requirements  for  controllability  and  observability  become  harder  to  satisfy,  and
the circuit is considered to be more difﬁcult to test.
