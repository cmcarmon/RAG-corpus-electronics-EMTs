{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial c}{\partial t}}=\nabla \cdot (D\nabla c)-\nabla \cdot ({\vec {v}}c)+R}

where
c is the variable of interest (species concentration for mass transfer, temperature for heat transfer),
D is the diffusivity (also called diffusion coefficient), such as mass diffusivity for particle motion or thermal diffusivity for heat transport,







v
→






{\displaystyle {\vec {v}}\ }
is the velocity field that the quantity is moving with. It is function of time and space. For example, in advection, c might be the concentration of salt in a river, and then






v

{\displaystyle {\vec {v}}}
would be the velocity of the water flow,






v
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {v}}}
=f(time, location). Another example, c might be the concentration of small bubbles in a calm lake, and then






v
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {v}}}
would be the velocity of bubbles rising towards the surface by buoyancy (see below) depending on time and location of the bubble. For multiphase flows and flows in porous media,






v
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {v}}}
is the (hypothetical) superficial velocity.
R describes "sources" or "sinks" of the quantity c. For example, for a chemical species, R > 0 means that a chemical reaction is creating more of the species, and R < 0 means that a chemical reaction is destroying the species. For heat transport, R > 0 might occur if thermal energy is being generated by friction.
