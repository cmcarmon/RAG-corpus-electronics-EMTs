Binary numbers – particularly large ones – are not 
very convenient. To make numbers easier to handle 
we  often  convert  binary  numbers  to  hexadecimal 
(base 16). This format is easier for mere humans to 
comprehend  and  offers  the  advantage  over  denary 
(base  10)  in  that  it  can  be  converted  to  and  from 
binary  with  ease.  The  first  sixteen  numbers  in 
binary,  denary,  and  hexadecimal  are  shown  in  the 
table below. A single hexadecimal character (in the 
range zero to F) is used to represent a group of four 
binary  digits  (bits).  This  group  of  four  bits  (or 
single hex. character) is sometimes called a nibble.
A byte  of  data  comprises  a  group  of  eight  bits. 
Thus  a  byte  can  be  represented  by  just  two 
hexadecimal  (hex)  characters.  A  group  of  sixteen 
bits  (a  word)  can  be  represented  by  four  hex 
characters, thirty-two bits (a double word by eight 
hex. characters, and so on). 
  The  value  of  a  byte  expressed  in  binary  can  be 
easily  converted  to  hex  by  arranging  the  bits  in 
groups  of  four  and  converting  each  nibble  into 
hexadecimal using the table shown below:
