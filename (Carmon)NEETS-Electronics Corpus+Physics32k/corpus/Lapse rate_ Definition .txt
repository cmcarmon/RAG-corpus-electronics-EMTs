A formal definition from the Glossary of Meteorology is:
The decrease of an atmospheric variable with height, the variable being temperature unless otherwise specified.
In general, a lapse rate is the negative of the rate of temperature change with altitude change, thus:




Γ

d
T


d
z





{\displaystyle \Gamma =-{\frac {dT}{dz}}}

where



Γ


{\displaystyle \Gamma }
is the lapse rate given in units of temperature divided by units of altitude, T = temperature, and z = altitude.
