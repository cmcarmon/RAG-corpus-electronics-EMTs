Open circuits are often created by design. For instance, a simple light switch 
opens and closes the circuit that connects a light to a power source. When you 
build a circuit, it’s a good idea to disconnect the battery or other power source 
when the circuit is not in use. Technically, that’s creating an open circuit.
