10 mm2 active area, and 3 mm depth) are used in order to decrease capacitance and therefore further reduce
electronic noise. Lithium-drifted silicon (Si:Li) detectors were used ﬁrst for these applications. Early germanium
detectors displayed poor peak shape for X-ray energies just above the L absorption edges (attributed to diffusion
against the ﬁeld to the front contact by some electrons and their resulting loss to the photopeak [17]). However,
as  was  ﬁrst  demonstrated  by  Cox  et al.  [18],  this  is  not  a  fundamental  problem,  but  can  be  solved  by  the
contacting technology. An X-ray spectrum taken with an HPGe detector is shown in Fig. 116.13. Germanium
has the advantages with respect to silicon of a smaller ε (2.96 eV/pair vs. 3.96 eV/pair at 77K) for better energy
resolution, and a higher Z (32 vs. 14) for better photoelectric absorption of higher-energy X-rays.
