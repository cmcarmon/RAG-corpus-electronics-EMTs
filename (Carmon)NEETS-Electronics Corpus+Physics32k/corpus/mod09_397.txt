At T2, a negative trigger is again applied to both bases. This time, Q1 is brought into conduction and 
the regenerative switching action cuts off Q2. The bistable multivibrator will continue to change states as 
long as triggers are applied. Notice that two input triggers are required to produce one gate; one to turn it 
on and the other to turn it off. The input trigger frequency is twice the output frequency.
