The Poynting–Robertson effect is more pronounced for smaller objects. Gravitational force varies with mass, which is



∝

r

3




{\displaystyle \propto r^{3}}
(where



r


{\displaystyle r}
is the radius of the dust), while the power it receives and radiates varies with surface area (



∝

r

2




{\displaystyle \propto r^{2}}
). So for large objects the effect is negligible.
The effect is also stronger closer to the sun. Gravity varies as





1

R

2






{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{R^{2}}}}
(where R is the radius of the orbit) whereas the Poynting–Robertson force varies as





1

R

2.5






{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{R^{2.5}}}}
, so the effect also gets relatively stronger as the object approaches the Sun. This tends to reduce the eccentricity of the object's orbit in addition to dragging it in.
In addition, as the size of the particle increases, the surface temperature is no longer approximately constant, and the radiation pressure is no longer isotropic in the particle's reference frame. If the particle rotates slowly, the radiation pressure may contribute to the change in angular momentum, either positively or negatively.
Radiation pressure affects the effective force of gravity on the particle: it is felt more strongly by smaller particles, and blows very small particles away from the Sun. It is characterized by the dimensionless dust parameter
