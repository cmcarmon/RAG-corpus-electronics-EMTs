Consider two stationary plane walls with a constant volume flow rate



Q


{\displaystyle Q}
is injected/sucked at the point of intersection of plane walls and let the angle subtended by two walls be



2
α


{\displaystyle 2\alpha }
. Take the cylindrical coordinate



(
r

θ
,
z
)


{\displaystyle (r,\theta ,z)}
system with



r
=
0


{\displaystyle r=0}
representing point of intersection and



θ
=
0


{\displaystyle \theta =0}
the centerline and



(
u
,
v
,
w
)


{\displaystyle (u,v,w)}
are the corresponding velocity components. The resulting flow is two-dimensional if the plates are infinitely long in the axial



z


{\displaystyle z}
direction, or the plates are longer but finite, if one were neglect edge effects and for the same reason the flow can be assumed to be entirely radial i.e.,



u
=
u
(
r
,
θ
)
,
v
=
0
,
w
=
0


{\displaystyle u=u(r,\theta ),v=0,w=0}
.
Then the continuity equation and the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations reduce to

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {\partial (ru)}{\partial r}}&=0,\\[6pt]u{\frac {\partial u}{\partial r}}&=-{\frac {1}{\rho }}{\frac {\partial p}{\partial r}}+\nu \left[{\frac {1}{r}}{\frac {\partial }{\partial r}}\left(r{\frac {\partial u}{\partial r}}\right)+{\frac {1}{r^{2}}}{\frac {\partial ^{2}u}{\partial \theta ^{2}}}-{\frac {u}{r^{2}}}\right]\\[6pt]0&=-{\frac {1}{\rho r}}{\frac {\partial p}{\partial \theta }}+{\frac {2\nu }{r^{2}}}{\frac {\partial u}{\partial \theta }}\end{aligned}}}

The boundary conditions are no-slip condition at both walls and the third condition is derived from the fact that the volume flux injected/sucked at the point of intersection is constant across a surface at any radius.
