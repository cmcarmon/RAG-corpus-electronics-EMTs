The VARACTOR is a diode that exhibits the characteristics of a variable capacitor. The depletion 
region at the PN junction acts as the dielectric of a capacitor and is caused to expand and contract by the 
voltage applied to the diode. This action increases and decreases the capacitance. The schematic symbol 
for the varactor is shown below. Varactors are used in tuning circuits and can be used as high-frequency 
amplifiers.
