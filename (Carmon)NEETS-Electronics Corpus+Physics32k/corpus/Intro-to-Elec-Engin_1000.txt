which are identical in form to the corresponding emf equations for a transformer. The effect of
a time-varying ﬂux in association with stationary transformer windings is the same as that of the
relative motion of a coil and a constant-amplitude spatial ﬂux-density wave in a rotating machine.
The space distribution of ﬂux density is transformed into a time variation of voltage because of the
time element introduced by mechanical rotation. The induced voltage is a single-phase voltage
for single-phase synchronous machines of the nature discussed so far. As pointed out earlier, to
avoid the pulsating torque, the designer could employ polyphase windings and polyphase sources
to develop constant power under balanced conditions of operation.
