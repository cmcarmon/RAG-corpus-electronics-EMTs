Here we have a bridge circuit, and for the sake of example we will suppose that it is not
balanced (ratio R1/R4 not equal to ratio R2/R5). If it were balanced, there would be zero current
through R3, and it could be approached as a series/parallel combination circuit (R1−−R4 //
R2−−R5). However, any current through R3 makes a series/parallel analysis impossible. R1 is
not in series with R4 because there’s another path for electrons to ﬂow through R3. Neither is
R2 in series with R5 for the same reason. Likewise, R1 is not in parallel with R2 because R3 is
separating their bottom leads. Neither is R4 in parallel with R5. Aaarrggghhhh!
