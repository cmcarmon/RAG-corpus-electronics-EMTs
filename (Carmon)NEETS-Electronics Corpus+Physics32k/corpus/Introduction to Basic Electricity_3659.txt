A capacitor affects the circuit in the following 
manner. When the anode of the diode is positive, 
current flows in the circuit. At the same time, the 
filter capacitor charges to the polarity indicated in  
Figure 36-14. After 90Â° of the input signal, the capaci-
tor is fully charged to the peak potential of the circuit. 
When the input signal starts to drop in the  negative 
direction, the capacitor discharges through the load. 
The resistance of the load controls the rate the  capacitor 
 discharges by the RC time constant. The  discharge 
time constant is long compared to the  cycle time. 
 Therefore the cycle is completed before the  capacitor 
can discharge. Thus, after the first quarter cycle, the 
current through the load is supplied by the  discharging 
capacitor. As the capacitor discharges, the voltage 
stored in the capacitor decreases. However,  before  
the capacitor can completely discharge, the next  cycle 
of the sine wave occurs. This causes the anode of 
the  diode to become positive, allowing the diode to
