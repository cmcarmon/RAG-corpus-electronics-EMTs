Several types of drilling equipment and different access strategies to reach the miners with escape boreholes were tried in parallel. When the escape shaft reached the miners, there were three plans in operation—the Strata 950 ("Plan A", 702 meter target depth at 90°), the Schramm T130XD ("Plan B", 638 meter target depth at 82°), and a RIG-421 drill ("Plan C", 597 meter target depth at 85°).
