One of the unappealing features of the mechanical switches in Figure 6.1
was that they responded only to mechanical pressure at their control terminal.
The need for mechanical pressure would make it unacceptably hard to build
logic circuits because the voltage at the output of a given switch would have to
somehow be converted to a mechanical pressure to influence another switch.
Preferably, a three-terminal switch device that responded to voltages would
enable the construction of switching circuits using voltages alone. The MOSFET
is one such device that can be implemented cheaply in VLSI technology.
