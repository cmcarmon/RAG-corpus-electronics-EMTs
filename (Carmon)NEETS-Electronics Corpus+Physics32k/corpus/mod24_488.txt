For both techniques, the test fiber is loosely supported in a single-turn with a constant radius of 140
mm. Figure 5-5 shows this single-turn configuration. The transmitted signal power Ps ( l ) is then recorded
while scanning the wavelength range in increments of 10 nm or less. The launch and detection conditions
are not changed while scanning over the range of wavelengths. The wavelength range scanned
encompasses the expected cutoff wavelength.
