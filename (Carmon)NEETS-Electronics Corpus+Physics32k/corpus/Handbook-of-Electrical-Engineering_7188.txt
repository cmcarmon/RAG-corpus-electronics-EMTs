The Difference between Fixed-to-Fixed Radio Communication 
and Mobile Communication
In ﬁxed-to-ﬁxed radio communications, the transmitter power, antenna location, antenna height, and antenna
gain can be determined after calculating the link budget. Also, depending on the frequency range of the carrier
affected on the atmospheric variation, different “margin” values will be put in the budget calculation for different
system applications. The ﬁxed-to-ﬁxed radio links are usually 10 miles or longer and high above the ground.
The signal variation over the link is due mostly to atmospheric changes. Satellite communications, microwave
links, troposcatter, etc. are ﬁxed-to-ﬁxed radio communications. In mobile radio communications, the param-
eters such as transmitter power, antenna location, antenna height, and antenna gain are determined by covering
an area or cell. In mobile radio communications, at least one end is in motion. The sizes of cells in urban and
suburban areas are less than 10 miles. In mobile radio communications, the design of cell coverage is based on
the average power. No margin is applied in calculating the cell coverage.
