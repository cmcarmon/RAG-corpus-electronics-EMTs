COMPARING FSK AND CW SIGNALS.â€”A comparison of on-off keyed cw (figure 2-2), (view
(A), view (B), view (C)), and fsk (figure 2-3), (view (A), view (B), view (C)), signals will show clearly
the principal features of fsk and give us a basis on which frequency modulation can be discussed. Let's
use views (A), (B), and (C) of both figures to show the Morse code character "F" for an example. Figures
2-2 and 2-3 are graphic drawings of the two types of keying. Time and amplitude are known dimensions
of AM; but to explain fsk properly, we have added the third dimension of frequency.
