Figure 2-28 is a multiple crystal, frequency synthesizer that produces desired output frequencies by
mixing frequencies from several crystal oscillators. Each oscillator uses ten or more crystals to control its
operating frequency. This provides for a large number of output frequency combinations. Figure 2-29 is a
practical frequency synthesizer in which the harmonics and subharmonics of a single standard oscillator
are combined to provide a wide multichoice of output signals. Each of these signals is harmonically
related to a subharmonic of the standard oscillator. You will find the primary difficulty encountered in the
frequency synthesizers is the presence of spurious signals generated in the "combining mixers." Extensive
filtering and extremely careful selection of operating frequencies are required for even the simplest
circuits. Spurious frequency problems increase and channel spacing decreases as the range of operating
frequencies increases.
