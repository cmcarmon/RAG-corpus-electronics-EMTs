 (PCM) ICs are high-precision A/D converters. The PCM IC is often refered to as a
  with  both  encoder  and  decoder  functions.  The  encoder  portion  of  the  codec  performs  the A/D
PCM 
conversion,  and  the  decoder  portion  of  the  codec  performs  the  D/A  conversion.  The  digital  code  is  usually
formatted as a serial data stream for ease of interfacing to digital transmission and multiplexing systems.
