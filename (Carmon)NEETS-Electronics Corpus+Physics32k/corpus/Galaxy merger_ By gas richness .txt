Wet merger: It is a merger between gas-rich galaxies, or blue galaxies. Wet mergers may produce a larger amount of star formation, transform disc galaxies into elliptical galaxies and trigger quasar activity.
Dry merger: It takes place between gas-poor galaxies, or red galaxies. These mergers may not affect the star formation rate heavily but can play an important role in the stellar mass growth.
Damp merger: A type of merger between the two mentioned above, where there's enough gas to fuel significant star formation but not enough to form globular clusters
Mixed merger: It occurs when gas-rich and gas-poor galaxies, or blue and red galaxies, merge.
