A pulsed radar transmits a relatively short burst of pulses, and
after each pulse, the receiver is turned on to receive the echo.
According to the primary missions, radars can be classiﬁed
into search radars and tracking radars. Search radars con-
tinuously scan a volume of space without dwelling at any
location. Their primary missions are detecting targets and
determining a target’s range and direction. Tracking radars
dwell on individual targets and track their motion in range,
azimuth, elevation, and/or Doppler.
