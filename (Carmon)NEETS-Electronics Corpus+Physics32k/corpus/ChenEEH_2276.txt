minor axis (AR  1). In the time domain, the electric ﬁeld
vector rotates with the tip of the vector lying on the ellipse.
Right-handed elliptical polarization (RHEP) corresponds to
counterclockwise rotation (the thumb of the right hand aligns
with the direction of propagation, and the ﬁngers of the right
hand align with the direction of rotation in time; this is the
IEEE deﬁnition, which is opposite to the usual optics conven-
tion.) LHEP corresponds to rotation in the opposite direction.
A convenient way to represent the polarization state is with
the Poincare´ sphere (Kraus, 1988). Using spherical trigono-
metric relations, the following results may be derived for the
tilt angle of the ellipse and the axial ratio:
tan 2t ¼ tan 2g cos f,
sin 2j ¼ sin 2g sin f:
