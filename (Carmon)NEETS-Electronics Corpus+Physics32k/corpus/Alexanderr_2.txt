The best approach is to work as many problems as possible in all
of your courses. However, if you are really going to be successful with
this, you must spend time analyzing where and when and why you have
difÔ¨Åculty  in  easily  arriving  at  successful  solutions.  You  may  be  sur-
prised  to  learn  that  most  of  your  problem-solving  problems  are  with
mathematics  rather  than  your  understanding  of  theory.  You  may  also
learn that you start working the problem too soon. Taking time to think
about  the  problem  and  how  you  should  solve  it  will  always  save  you
time and frustration in the end.
