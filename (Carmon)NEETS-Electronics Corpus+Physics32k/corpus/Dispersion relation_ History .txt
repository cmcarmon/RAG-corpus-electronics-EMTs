Isaac Newton studied refraction in prisms but failed to recognize the material dependence of the dispersion relation, dismissing the work of another researcher whose measurement of a prism's dispersion did not match Newton's own.
Dispersion of waves on water was studied by Pierre-Simon Laplace in 1776.
The universality of the Kramers-Kronig relations (1926â€“27) became apparent with subsequent papers on the dispersion relation's connection to causality in the scattering theory of all types of waves and particles.
