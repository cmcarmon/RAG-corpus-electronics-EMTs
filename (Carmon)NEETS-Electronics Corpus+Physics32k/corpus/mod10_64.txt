Time is an important factor in wave studies. When a wave train passes through a medium, a certain
number of individual waves pass a given point in a specific unit of time. For example, if a cork on a water
wave rises and falls once every second, the wave makes one complete up-and-down vibration every
second. The number of vibrations, or cycles, of a wave train in a unit of time is called the FREQUENCY
of the wave train and is measured in HERTZ. If 5 waves pass a point in one second, the frequency of the
wave train is 5 cycles per second. In figure 1-7, the frequency of both wave 1 and wave 2 is four cycles
per second (cycles per second is abbreviated as cps).
