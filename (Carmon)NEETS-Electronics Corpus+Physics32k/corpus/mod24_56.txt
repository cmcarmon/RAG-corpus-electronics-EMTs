Advances in fiber optics have permitted the introduction of fiber optics into present applications.
These applications are mostly in the telephone long-haul systems, but are growing to include cable
television, computer networks, video systems, and data links. Research should increase system
performance and provide solutions to existing problems in conventional applications. The impressive
results from early research show there are many advantages offered by fiber optic systems.
