(1984) presented the seminal work in ABFT in which methods
of detecting and correcting errors in various matrix computa-
tions using checksum-encoded matrices were discussed. These
methods use the linear transformation property of matrix
computations to detect errors in the result matrix. Subse-
quently, a number of ABFT schemes were proposed for error
detection in different computations like Fourier transforms
(Malek and Choi, 1985) and matrix equation solvers (Luk
and Park, 1988). Most ABFT schemes use a ﬂoating point
(FP) checksum equality test that is susceptible to roundoff in
FP computations of ﬁnite precision. This susceptibility arises
from the difference in the sequence of operations used in
computing the two sides of the equality test. Roundoff error
analysis in Wilkinson (1963) indicates that upper bounds on
the (roundoff) error in FP operations are dependent on the
quantities involved, the order in which the intermediate oper-
ations are performed, and the precision used in the intermedi-
ate result’s accumulation.
