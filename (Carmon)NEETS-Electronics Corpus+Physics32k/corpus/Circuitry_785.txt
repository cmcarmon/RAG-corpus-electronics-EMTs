Transient analysis 
 
The transient analysis feature of a SPICE package 
computes 
transient  output  variables  as  a 
function of time over a user-specified time interval.  
The initial conditions are automatically determined 
by  a  DC  analysis.    All  sources  that  are  not  time 
dependent (for example, power supplies) are set to 
their DC value.
