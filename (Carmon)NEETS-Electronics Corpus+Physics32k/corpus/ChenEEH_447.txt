Bipolar transistors are employed wherever speed and drive
capability are required. Major application areas include high-
speed data links, such as in ﬁber-optic communications;
RF-front-ends, such as mixers and ampliﬁers in wireless com-
munications; and drivers, bias circuitry, and high-speed logic
