In the same way that physical masks cover the wearer's face, sound maskers cover up, hide, or disguise other sounds but do not change or eliminate them. True noise cancellation that eliminates sound works only within spatially constrained areas, such as headphones, and cannot be applied to entire rooms. Thus, in larger spaces, one may instead mask distracting sounds, such as conversations, by raising the ambient background sounds up to or above the level of the expected intrusive ones. In the home, the level needed to mask sounds is low, and at sporting events, that level is high. The goal is to provide fewer distractions without the masking sound itself becoming a distraction, which requires persons experienced with this technique to find that optimum level.
