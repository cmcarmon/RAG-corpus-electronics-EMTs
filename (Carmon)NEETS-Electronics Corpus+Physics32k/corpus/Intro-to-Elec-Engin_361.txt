The three-line cable coming out of the secondaries of the distribution transformer on the
utility pole passes through the electric meter that measures energy consumption in kilowatt-hours
and terminates at the main panel. Figure 4.4.2 shows a typical wiring arrangement for a residence.
At the main panel, circuit breakers serve the joint role of disconnecting switches and overcurrent
protection; the neutral is connected to a busbar (bus) and in turn to the local earth ground; the hot
lines are connected to individual circuits for lighting and appliances, as illustrated in Figure 4.4.2.
The circuit breaker labeled GFCI (ground-fault circuit interruption), used for safety primarily
with outdoor circuits and in bathrooms, has additional features that will be described later. Note
that every outgoing “hot” wire must be connected to a circuit breaker, whereas every neutral wire
and ground wire must be tied directly to earth ground at the neutral busbar.
