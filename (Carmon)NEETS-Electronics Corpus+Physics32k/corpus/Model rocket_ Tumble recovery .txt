Another simple approach appropriate for small rockets — or rockets with a large cross-sectional area — is to have the rocket tumble back to earth. Any rocket that will enter a stable, ballistic trajectory as it falls is not safe to use with tumble recovery. To prevent this, some such rockets use the ejection charge to slide the engine to the rear of the rocket, moving the center of mass behind the center of pressure and thus making the rocket unstable.
