 by means of a common memory location. This single-byte memory
location contains a non-negative integer value which represents a station selection. (For example, 0000 0000
might  represent  87.9  MHz,  0000  0001  might  represent  88.1  MHz,  etc.)  The  RBS  may “read”  this  memory
location to “memorize” a current station selection. The RBS may also “write” to this memory location to cause
the tuning system to select another station.
