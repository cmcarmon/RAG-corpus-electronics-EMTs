In an induction machine, the stator winding is essentially the same as in a synchronous
machine. Equation (12.2.13) and the considerations leading to it hold here as in the case of a
synchronous machine. When excited from a balanced polyphase source, the polyphase windings
produce a magnetic Ô¨Åeld in the air gap rotating at a synchronous speed determined by the number
of poles and the applied stator frequency given by Equation (12.2.9). On the rotor, the winding is
electrically closed on itself (i.e., short-circuited) and often has no external terminals.
