A relatively new head which is now being used for readback of information in high-density recording is the
magnetoresistive  (MR)  head.  MR  heads  are  based  on  the  phenomenon  of  magnetoresistance,  in  which  the
electrical resistance of a magnetic material is dependent upon the direction of magnetization in the material
