sectional view of a four-pole machine is given in Fig. 66.2. For the speciﬁed direction of the (dc) current in the
rotor windings, the rotor ﬁeld has two pairs of north and south poles arranged as shown. The emf induced in a
stator winding completes one period for every pair of north and south poles sweeping by; thus, each revolution
of the rotor corresponds to two periods of the stator emf’s. If the machine is to operate at 60 Hz then the rotor

That is, the lower the number of poles is, the higher the rotor speed has to be. In practice, the number of poles
is dictated by the mechanical system (prime mover) that drives the rotor. Steam turbines operate best at a high
speed; thus, two- or four-pole machines are suitable. Machines driven by hydro turbines usually have more poles.
Usually, the stator windings are arranged so that the resulting armature ﬁeld has the same number of poles
as the rotor ﬁeld. In practice, there are many possible ways to arrange these windings; the essential idea, however,
can be understood via the simple arrangement shown in Fig. 66.2. Each phase consists of a pair of windings

suggests that, at any time instant, equal emf ’s are induced across the windings of the same phase. If the individual
windings are connected in series as shown in Fig. 66.2, their emf ’s add up to form the phase voltage.
