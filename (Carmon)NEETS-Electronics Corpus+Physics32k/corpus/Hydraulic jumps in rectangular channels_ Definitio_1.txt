The basic principles behind the momentum function are:
Conservation of momentum which "states that the total momentum of a closed system of objects (which has no interactions with external agents) is constant" and
Newton's laws of motion stating that the sum of the forces in a particular direction is equal to the mass times acceleration in that direction.
