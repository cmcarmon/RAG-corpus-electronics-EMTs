View (A) of figure 3-11 shows a typical Foster-Seeley discriminator. The collector circuit of the
preceding limiter/amplifier circuit (Q1) is shown. The limiter/amplifier circuit is a special amplifier
circuit which limits the amplitude of the signal. This limiting keeps interfering noise low by removing
