Packaging of MEMS is more challenging than the already
quite complex packaging of ICs for a sequence of reasons.
Some MEMS can be sealed in prescribed atmospheres in the
same kinds of packages as ordinary chips. Microaccelerometers
are an example. Many MEMS, however, require vacuum pack-
aging to avoid air damping of vibratory structures or deleteri-
for frequency
ous
standards and uncooled infrared sensor arrays fall
in this
category. The MEMS that are used to measure ambient effects
must be open in some way to atmospheric conditions. Pressure
sensors are an example; they have compliant seals that transmit
pressure but not humidity or chemical vapors. However,
MEMS designed to measure the latter quantities must be
fully open to the atmosphere. Maintenance of performance
over their shelf lives and during use is a problem. Some
MEMS, such as those mounted on the surface of a structure
to control motion, notably vibrations or airï¬‚ow, are not in
separate packages. They have to be mounted on open surfaces,
so they offer another set of challenges.
