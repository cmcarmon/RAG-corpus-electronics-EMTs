Sine-wave generators produce signals ranging from low audio frequencies to ultrahigh radio and 
microwave frequencies. Many low-frequency generators use resistors and capacitors to form their 
frequency-determining networks and are referred to as RC OSCILLATORS. They are widely used in the 
audio-frequency range.
