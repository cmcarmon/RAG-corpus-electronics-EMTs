In figure 2-50 the solid curve represents the unquantized values of a modulating sinusoid. The
dashed curve is reconstructed from the quantized values taken at the sampling interval and shows a very
close agreement with the original curve. Figure 2-51 is identical to figure 2-50 except that the sampling
interval is four times as great and the reconstructed curve is not faithful to the original. As previously
stated, the sampling rate of a pulsed system must be at least twice the highest modulating frequency to get
