No discussion about the Internet’s future would be complete without a quick look at the legal aspects. We
have already seen an attempt by the government to censor content on the Internet. The recent Telecommuni-
cations Act called for criminal penalties for certain obscene material provided to the Internet. This was struck
down by the Supreme Court, but look for more attempts to regulate this new media. In addition, the concerns
about intellectual property and copyright infringement are already being addressed. Many Internet users “use”
material on their Web sites without permission from their creators. This applies to music licenses for entertain-
ment, reprints of news stories and books, cartoons, artists creations, and copyrighted research. Be careful in this
area. The larger the pockets of the user, the more apt they are to be sued for copyright infringement. As the years
go by, you will see many new regulations and judicial decisions in favor of the creators of this material.
