The very presence of noise suggests that the PCM reconstruction circuits may occasion-
ally make a mistake in deciding what input pulse was received in a given bit interval. How
often an error is made is determined by the bit-error probability. Bit errors in a unipolar
system occur much more frequently than in a polar system having the same signal-to-noise
ratio.
