One	of	the	laws	that	underwent	heavy	testing	is	a	law	that	gives	importance	to	the
electrostatic	relationship	of	all	the	charged	elements	within	a	circuit;	this	law	is
called	Coulomb’s	Law	after	the	scientist,	Charles	Agustin	de	Coulomb.	It	argues
that	the	magnitude	of	interactive	circuit	components	is	in	direct	proportion	to	the
squared	area	between	the	distances.	To	demonstrate	a	point,	it	shows	that	the
primary	force	works	along	a	straight	line.
Moreover,	Coulomb’s	Law	requires	that	the	placement	of	the	charged	elements	is
accomplished	through	a	single	medium.	This	causes	the	arrangement	to	eliminate
any	possible	complications.
