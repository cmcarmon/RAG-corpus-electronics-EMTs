One practical and popular use of electric current is for the operation of electric lighting. The
simplest form of electric lamp is a tiny metal ”ﬁlament” inside of a clear glass bulb, which glows
white-hot (”incandesces”) with heat energy when sufﬁcient electric current passes through it.
Like the battery, it has two conductive connection points, one for electrons to enter and the
other for electrons to exit.
