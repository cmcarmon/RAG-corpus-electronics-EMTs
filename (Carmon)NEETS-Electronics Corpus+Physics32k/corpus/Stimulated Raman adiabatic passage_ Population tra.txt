Consider the description of three level Ʌ atom having ground states

g

1


⟩


{\displaystyle |g_{1}\rangle }
and




|


g

2


⟩


{\displaystyle |g_{2}\rangle }
(for simplicity suppose that the energies of the ground states are the same) and excited state




|

e
⟩


{\displaystyle |e\rangle }
. Suppose in the beginning the total population is in the ground state




|


g

1


⟩


{\displaystyle |g_{1}\rangle }
. Here the logic for transformation of the population from ground state




|


g

1


⟩


{\displaystyle |g_{1}\rangle }
to




|


g

2


⟩


{\displaystyle |g_{2}\rangle }
is that initially the unpopulated states




|


g

2


⟩


{\displaystyle |g_{2}\rangle }
and




|

e
⟩


{\displaystyle |e\rangle }
couple, afterward superposition of state




|


g

2


⟩


{\displaystyle |g_{2}\rangle }
and




|

e
⟩


{\displaystyle |e\rangle }
couple to the state




|


g

1


⟩


{\displaystyle |g_{1}\rangle }
. Thereby a state is formed that permits the transformation of the population into state




|


g

2


⟩


{\displaystyle |g_{2}\rangle }
without populating the excited state




|

e
⟩


{\displaystyle |e\rangle }
. This process of transforming the population without populating the excited state is called the stimulated Raman adiabatic passage.
