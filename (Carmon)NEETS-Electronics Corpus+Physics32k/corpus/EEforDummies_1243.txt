The timer on the left operates at a lower frequency than the timer on the 
right and is used to modulate (okay, warble) the signal produced by the timer 
chip on the right. The signal at pin 2 of the 555 chip on the left is a slowly 
rising and falling ramp voltage, which you connect to pin 5 of the 555 chip on 
the right.
