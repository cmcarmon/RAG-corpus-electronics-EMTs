Generally a source of light can be considered a point source if the resolution of the imaging instrument is too low to resolve its apparent size. There are two types and sources of light. A point source, and an extended source.
Mathematically an object may be considered a point source if its angular size,



θ


{\displaystyle \theta }
, is much smaller than the resolving power of the telescope:



θ
<<
λ

/

D


{\displaystyle \theta <<\lambda /D}
,
where



λ


{\displaystyle \lambda }
is the wavelength of light and



D


{\displaystyle D}
is the telescope diameter.
Examples:
Light from a distant star seen through a small telescope
Light passing through a pinhole or other small aperture, viewed from a distance much greater than the size of the hole
Light from a street light in a large-scale study of light pollution or street illumination
