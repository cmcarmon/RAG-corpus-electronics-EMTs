A solar flare is a sudden flash of increased Sun's brightness, usually observed near its surface. Flares are often, but not always, accompanied by a coronal mass ejection.
Solar flares fall on a very broad spectrum of emissions, an energy release of typically 1020 joules of energy is considered to be the median for a well-observed event, while a major event can emit up to 1025 joules
The flare ejects clouds of electrons, ions, and atoms along with the electromagnetic waves through the Sun's corona into outer space. The phenomenon therefore provides an early example of multi-messenger astronomy. If ejection is in the direction of the Earth the particles hitting the upper atmosphere can cause bright auroras, and may even disrupt long range radio communication. It usually takes a day or two for these clouds to reach Earth. The term is also used to refer to similar phenomena in other stars, where the term stellar flare applies.
