Figure  7.25  shows  the  small-signal  input  and 
output currents and voltages for a common-emitter 
amplifier  stage.  The  magnitude  of  the  current 
produced at the output of the transistor is equal to 
the current gain, Ai, multiplied by the applied base 
current,  Ib. Since  the  output  current  is  the  current 
flowing in the collector, Ic, we can deduce that: 
 
Ic = Ai × Ib
where Ai = hfe  (the common-emitter current gain). 
 Figure  7.26  shows  how  this  current  source 
appears  between  the  collector  and  emitter.  Once 
again, 
is  not  a  discrete 
component—it appears inside the transistor. 
 The transistor’s transfer characteristic can be used 
to predict the current gain of a transistor amplifier 
stage. Since the transfer characteristic is linear, the 
current  gain  remains  reasonably  constant  over  a 
range  of  collector  current.  Figure  7.27  shows  a 
typical transfer characteristic in which the transistor 
is operated with a base current, IB, of 240 µA. This 
current produces a collector current, IC, of 12 mA. 
The  current  gain  corresponding  to  these  steady 
(d.c.) values will be given by:
