The graph on the right shows the impulse response of two similar systems. The green curve is the response of the system with impulse response

{\displaystyle y(t)=e^{-{\frac {t}{5}}}}
, while the blue represents the system

{\displaystyle y(t)=e^{-{\frac {t}{5}}}\sin(t)}
. Although one response is oscillatory, both return to the original value of 0 over time.
