Radio, television, radar, and the human eye have much in common because they all process the same 
type of electromagnetic energy. The major difference between the light processed by the human eye and 
the radio-frequency energy processed by radio and radar is frequency. For example, radio transmitters 
send out signals in all directions. These signals can be detected by receivers tuned to the same frequency. 
Radar works somewhat differently because it uses reflected energy (echo) instead of directly transmitted 
energy. The echo, as it relates to sound, is a familiar concept to most of us. An experienced person can 
estimate the distance and general direction of an object causing a sound echo. Radar uses microwave 
electromagnetic energy in much the same way.
