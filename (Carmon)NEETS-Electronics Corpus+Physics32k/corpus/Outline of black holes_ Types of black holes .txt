Schwarzschild metric – In Einstein's theory of general relativity, the Schwarzschild solution, named after Karl Schwarzschild, describes the gravitational field outside a spherical, uncharged, non-rotating mass such as a star, planet, or black hole.
Rotating black hole – black hole that possesses spin angular momentum.
Charged black hole – black hole that possesses electric charge.
Virtual black hole – black hole that exists temporarily as a result of a quantum fluctuation of spacetime.
