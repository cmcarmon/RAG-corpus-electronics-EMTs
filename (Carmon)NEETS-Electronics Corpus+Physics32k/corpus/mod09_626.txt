At the first instant of time, 100 volts is applied to the long time-constant circuit. The value of charge 
on the capacitor at the end of the first 100 microseconds of the input signal can be found by using the 
Universal Time Constant Chart (figure 4-34). Assume that a line is projected up from the point on the 
base line corresponding to 0.1TC. The line will intersect the curve at a point that is the percentage of 
voltage across the capacitor at the end of the first 100 microseconds. Since the applied voltage is 100 
volts, the charge on the capacitor at the end of the first 100 microseconds will be approximately 9.5 volts. 
At the end of the first 100 microseconds, the input signal will fall suddenly to 0 and the capacitor will 
begin to discharge. It will be able to discharge for 100 microseconds. Therefore, the capacitor will 
discharge 9.5 percent of its accumulated 9.5 volts (.095 × 9.5 = 0.90 volt). The discharge of the 0.90 volt 
will result in a remaining charge on the capacitor of 8.6 volts. At the end of 200 microseconds, the input 
signal will again suddenly rise to a value of 100 volts. The capacitor will be able to charge to 9.5 percent 
of the difference (100 − 8.6 = 91.4 volts). This may also be figured as a value of 8.7 volts plus the initial 
8.6 volts. This results in a total charge on the capacitor (at the end of the first 300 microseconds) of 8.7 + 
8.6 = 17.3 volts.
