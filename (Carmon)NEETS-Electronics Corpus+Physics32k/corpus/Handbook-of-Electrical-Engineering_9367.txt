1. Logic simulation for application-speciﬁc integrated circuits (ASICs). Software in this area might display
a schematic of a multigate ASIC from large functional building blocks. These blocks could represent a
ﬁnite-state machine with several states and gates. Representative packages are Mentor Graphics’ Auto-
Logic,  Cadence  Design  Systems’  HDL  Synthesizer  and  Optimizer,  and  Teradyne’s  Frenchip.  HDL  is  a
hardware description language.
