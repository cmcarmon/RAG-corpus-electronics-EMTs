Optical  switches  have  been  shown  to  be  quite  useful  in  the  telecommunications  area.  High-speed  2  ·  2
switches  for  time-domain  mux/demux  as  well  as  lower-speed  4  ·  4  switch  arrays  have  been  successfully
demonstrated. In both cases a major advantage of optical switching is that the switch data transmission rate is
not limited by the switch itself as is the case for electronic switches. Thus, it is possible to route optical signals
at data rates exceeding terabits/per second (1,000,000,000,000 bits/s).
