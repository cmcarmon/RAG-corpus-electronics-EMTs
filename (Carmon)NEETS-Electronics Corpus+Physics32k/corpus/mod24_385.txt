The types of mechanical splices that exist for mechanical splicing include glass, plastic, metal, and
ceramic tubes; and V-groove and rotary devices. Materials that assist mechanical splices in splicing fibers
include transparent adhesives and index matching gels. Transparent adhesives are epoxy resins that seal
mechanical splices and provide index matching between the connected fibers.
