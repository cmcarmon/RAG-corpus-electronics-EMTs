Consider the bipolar transistor, of which there are two types, npn and pnp. Electrically, they differ only in
terms  of  current  direction  and  voltage  polarity.  Figure  24.25(a)  illustrates  the  idealized  structure  of  an  npn
transistor, and diagram (b) implies that it corresponds to a pair of diodes with three leads. This representation
does not convey sufﬁcient information about the actual operation of the transistor, but it does make the point
that the ﬂow of conventional current (positive to negative) is easy from the base to the emitter, since it passes
through a forward-biased diode, but difﬁcult from the collector to the base, because ﬂow is prevented by a reverse-
biased diode.
