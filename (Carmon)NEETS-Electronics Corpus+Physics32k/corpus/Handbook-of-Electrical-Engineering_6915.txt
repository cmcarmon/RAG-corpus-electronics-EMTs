Processing errors can be reduced by using higher resolution of analog-to-digital converters, i.e., more bits to
represent each value. This lowers the quantization error power. Measurement error can be reduced while using
the same instruments by taking multiple measurements and averaging. Other estimation/correlation can yield
better values (e.g., the Global Positioning System location determination can be reduced from meters to a few
centimeters by multiple measurement estimation).
