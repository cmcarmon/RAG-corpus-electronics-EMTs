Use the following test only with bipolar transistors. Testing with a multimeter 
can permanently damage some types of transistors, especially field‐effect 
transistors (FETs). If you’re not sure what type of transistor you have, look 
it up in a datasheet before you test it. You can often find the datasheet by 
searching the Internet for the component‐identification number; for example, 
you might search for 2N3906 datasheet).
