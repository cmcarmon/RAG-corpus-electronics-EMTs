The strength of a given magnet is sometimes given in terms of its pull force— its ability to move (push/ pull) other objects. The pull force exerted by either an electromagnet or a permanent magnet at the "air gap" (i.e., the point in space where the magnet ends) is given by the Maxwell equation:




F
=




B

{\displaystyle F={{B^{2}A} \over {2\mu _{0}}}}
,
where
F is force (SI unit: newton)
A is the cross section of the area of the pole in square meters
B is the magnetic induction exerted by the magnet
Therefore, if a magnet is acting vertically, it can lift a mass m in kilograms given by the simple equation:




m
