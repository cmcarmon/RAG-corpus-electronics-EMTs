A requirement  of  some  oscillators  is  that  they 
accurately  maintain  an  exact 
frequency  of 
oscillation.  In  such  cases,  a  quartz  crystal  can  be 
used  as  the  frequency  determining  element.  The 
quartz  crystal  (a 
in  a 
hermetically  sealed  enclosure,  see  Fig.  9.11) 
vibrates whenever a potential difference is applied 
across its faces (this phenomenon is known as the 
piezoelectric  effect).  The  frequency  of  oscillation 
is  determined  by  the  crystal’s  ‘cut’  and  physical 
size.  
  Most quartz crystals can be expected to stabilize 
the frequency of oscillation of a circuit to within a 
few  parts 
in  a  million.  Crystals  can  be 
manufactured for operation in fundamental  mode 
over a frequency range extending from 100 kHz to 
around  20  MHz  and  for  overtone  operation  from 
20 MHz to well over 100 MHz. Figure 9.12 shows 
a simple  crystal  oscillator  circuit  in  which  the 
crystal  provides  feedback  from  the  drain  to  the 
source of a junction gate FET.
