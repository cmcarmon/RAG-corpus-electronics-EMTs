Typically, complex circuits are not arranged in nice, neat, clean schematic diagrams for us to
follow. They are often drawn in such a way that makes it difÔ¨Åcult to follow which components
are in series and which are in parallel with each other. The purpose of this section is to show
you a method useful for re-drawing circuit schematics in a neat and orderly fashion. Like the
stage-reduction strategy for solving series-parallel combination circuits, it is a method easier
demonstrated than described.
