Wireless electromagnetic channels are used in wireless communication systems, in which
the electromagnetic energy is coupled to the propagation medium through an antenna that serves
as a radiator. The physical size and conﬁguration of the antenna depend mainly on the frequency
of operation. For example, a radio station transmitting AM frequency band of 1 MHz (with
a corresponding wavelength of λ = c/fc = 300 m) requires an antenna of at least 30 m
(approximately one-tenth of the wavelength).
