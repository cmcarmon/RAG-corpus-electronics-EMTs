RADIO TRANSMITTER.â€”Figure 3-8 shows the front panel of the radio transmitter unit. The 
radio transmitter accepts audio or coded intelligence and uses it to modulate one of 280,000 possible 
operating radio frequencies in the 2.0- to 29.999-megahertz frequency range. Tuning is accomplished 
digitally by means of five control knobs and a switch located on the front panel. The transmitter has a 
normal rf output level of at least 100 milliwatts and is designed to be used with an associated rf power 
amplifier.
