Inductive pumps are considered highly accurate and energy efficient. Inductive pumps use two primary parameters to control flow, they are Rate and Dwell. Rate is used to determine the number of strokes per second or in any given time interval. Dwell is used to control the length of time the energizing coil remains on during the Rate cycle. Essentially if the piston has completed its stroke and is waiting for the reverse cycle to occur, there is no need to continue energizing the coil as most of this energy will be converted to heat as no more work is being done by the piston. The Dwell setting allows adjustment of this ON time during the rate cycle. Also the Dwell setting allows for a true pressure control parameter for the pump. By reducing the Dwell time even further one can reduce the total energy applied to the piston during the pumping cycle. This can reduce the maximum output pressure during pumping. This differs from many other pumps as they commonly reduce flow to reduce pressure in a given circumstance, however if an occlusion occurs to the output channel other pumps tend to build up to their maximum pressure until they either burst the tubing or damage their internal mechanism. Inductive pumps can be shut off at the outlet and will not exceed the pressure they are set at. Pumping against a close output does not cause damage to the pump.
