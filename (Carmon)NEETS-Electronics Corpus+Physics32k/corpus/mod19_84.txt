Pressure Points.Â—Bleeding from a cut artery or vein may often be controlled by pressure applied to 
the appropriate pressure point. A pressure point is a place where the main artery to the injured part lies 
near the skin surface and over a bone. Pressure at such a point is applied with the fingers (digital pressure) 
or with the hand; no first aid materials are required. The object of the pressure is to compress the artery 
against the bone, thus shutting off the flow of blood from the heart to the wound.
