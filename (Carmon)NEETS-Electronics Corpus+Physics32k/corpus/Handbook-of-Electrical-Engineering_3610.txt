A dielectric material can be described by a free-space part and a part that is due to the material alone. The
–
P
material part can be characterized by a polarization vector 
symbolizes the electric dipole moment per unit volume of the dielectric material. In the presence of an external
electric ﬁeld, the polarization vector may be caused by induced dipole moments, alignment of the permanent
dipole moments of the medium, or migration of ionic charges.
