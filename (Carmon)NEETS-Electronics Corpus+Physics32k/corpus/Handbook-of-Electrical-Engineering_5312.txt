Biomass Energy
Biological sources provide a wide array of materials that have been and continue to be used as energy sources.
Wood, wood wastes, and residue from wood processing industries, sewage or municipal solid waste, cultivated
herbaceous  and  other  energy  crops,  waste  from  food  processing  industries,  and  animal  wastes  are  lumped
 The most compelling argument for the use of biomass technologies is the inherent
together by the term 
recycling of the carbon by photosynthesis. In addition to the obvious method of burning biomass, conversion
to liquid and gaseous fuels is possible, thus expanding the application possibilities.
