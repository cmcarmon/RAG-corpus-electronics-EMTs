Chapter 1 described the resonant or tank circuit and how a sinusoidal signal is generated by the 
action of an inductor and a capacitor. The feedback signal is coupled from this circuit by either of two 
means. The first method is to take some of the energy from the inductor. This can be done by any one of 
the three ways shown in figure 2-7, views (A), (B), and (C). When an oscillator uses a TICKLER COIL, 
as shown in view (A), it is referred to as an ARMSTRONG OSCILLATOR. When an oscillator uses a 
tapped coil (view (B)) or a split coil (view (C)), it is referred to as a HARTLEY OSCILLATOR. The 
second method of coupling the feedback signal is to use two capacitors in the tank circuit and tap the 
feedback signal between them. This is shown in view (D). An oscillator using this method is referred to as 
a COLPITTS OSCILLATOR. Each of these particular oscillators is named after the person who 
originally designed them.
