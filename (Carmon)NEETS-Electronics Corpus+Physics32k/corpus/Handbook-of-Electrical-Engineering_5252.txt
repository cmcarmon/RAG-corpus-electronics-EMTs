The solid crust of the earth is an average of 20 mil (32 km) deep. Under the solid crust is the molten mass, the
magma. The heat stored in the magma is the source of geothermal energy. The hot molten magma comes close
to  the  surface  at  certain  points  in  the  earth  and  produces  volcanoes,  hot  springs,  and  geysers.  These  are  the
signs of a possible geothermal site. Three forms of geothermal energy are considered for development.
