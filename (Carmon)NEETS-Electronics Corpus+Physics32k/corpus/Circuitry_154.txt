The total current, Isc, will be given by: 
 
Isc = 4 µA + 10 µA + 5 µA = 19 µA 
 
Next  we  need  to  find  the  Norton  equivalent 
resistance.  To  do  this,  we  can  redraw  the  circuit 
showing  each  sensor  replaced  by  its  internal 
resistance, as shown in Fig. 3.22. 
  The  equivalent  resistance  of  this  arrangement 
(think of this as the resistance seen looking into the 
circuit in the direction of the arrow  shown in Fig. 
3.22) is given by: 
1

where R1 = 5 kF, R2 = 3 kF, R3 = 2 kF. Hence: 
1
R
or 
1 = 0.0002 + 0.00033 0.0005 0.00103

from which: 
 
R = 968 F
The Norton equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 3.23. 
To  determine  the  voltage  in  a  l  kF moving  coil 
meter  connected  between  A  and  B,  we  can  make 
use  of  the  Norton  equivalent  circuit  by  simply 
adding  a  1  kF resistor  to  the  circuit  and  applying 
Ohm’s Law, as shown in Fig. 3.24. 
  The  voltage  appearing  across  the  moving  coil 
meter in Fig. 3.25 will be given by: 
1,000 968
1,000 + 968
