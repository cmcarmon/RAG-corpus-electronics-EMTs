PERT chart explicitly defines and makes visible dependencies (precedence relationships) between the work breakdown structure (commonly WBS) elements.
PERT facilitates identification of the critical path and makes this visible.
PERT facilitates identification of early start, late start, and slack for each activity.
PERT provides for potentially reduced project duration due to better understanding of dependencies leading to improved overlapping of activities and tasks where feasible.
The large amount of project data can be organized and presented in diagram for use in decision making.
PERT can provide a probability of completing before a given time.
