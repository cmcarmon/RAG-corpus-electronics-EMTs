Short Titles Act (with its variations) is a stock short title used for legislation in Ireland and the United Kingdom which retroactively confers short titles on a large number of earlier pieces of legislation. The Bill for an Act with this short title will have been known as a Short Titles Bill during its passage through Parliament.
Halsbury's Laws said that Short Titles Acts are law reform Acts.
