is being given comparable weight to area and speed consider-
ations (Najm, 1994). Several important factors have also con-
tributed to this increased concern about power. One of these
primary driving factors has been the remarkable success and
growth of the personal computing device (e.g., Pass portable
desktops, audio- and video-based multimedia products, etc.)
and wireless communications systems (e.g., personal digital
assistants, personal communicators, etc.) that demand high-
speed computation and complex functionality with low-power
consumption (Pedram, 1995). Unfortunately, this rapid devel-
opment in VLSI has not been reï¬‚ected in developments in
