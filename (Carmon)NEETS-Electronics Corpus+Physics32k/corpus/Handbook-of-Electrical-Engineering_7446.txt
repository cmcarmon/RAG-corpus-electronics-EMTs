As illustrated in Fig. 78.1, a communication system is a collection of subsystems such that the overall system
provides a reliable path for information ﬂow from source to user. In a computer simulation of the system, the
individual subsystems must ﬁrst be accurately modeled by signal processing operations. The overall simulation
program is a collection of these signal processing operations and must accurately model the overall commu-
nication system. The important subject of subsystem modeling will be treated in a following section.
