There  are  many  types  of  chemical  sensors  used
in  biomedical  instrumentation.  Table  114.3  lists
some general categories of sensors. Electrochemical
An example
and optical sensors are most frequently used for biomedical measurements both 
of an electrochemical sensor is the Clark electrode illustrated in Fig. 114.3. This consists of an electrochemical
cell separated from the specimen being measured by an oxygen-permeable membrane. The cell is driven at a
Ô¨Åxed potential of 600 mV, and under these conditions the following reaction occurs at the noble metal cathode:
