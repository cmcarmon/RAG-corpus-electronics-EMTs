The distance to the Moon can be measured to an accuracy of 2 mm over a 1-hour sampling period, which results in an overall uncertainty of 2–3 cm for the average distance. However, due to its elliptical orbit with varying eccentricity, the instantaneous distance varies with monthly periodicity. Furthermore, the distance is perturbed by the gravitational effects of various astronomical bodies - most significantly the Sun and less so by Jupiter. Other forces responsible for minute perturbations are other planets in the solar system, asteroids, tidal forces, and relativistic effects. The effect of radiation pressure from the sun contributes an amount of ±3.6 mm to the lunar distance.
Although the instantaneous uncertainty is sub-millimeter, the measured lunar distance can change by more than 21000 km from the mean value throughout a typical month. These perturbations are well understood and the lunar distance can be accurately modeled over thousands of years.
