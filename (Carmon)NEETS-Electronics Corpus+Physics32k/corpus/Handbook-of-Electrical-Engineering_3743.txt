Another  advantage  of  the  MR  head  is  that  it  senses  magnetic  ﬂux f,  not  the  time  rate  of  change  of  ﬂux
d(f)/dt as an inductive head does. Consequently, whereas the inductive head output voltage is dependent upon
the head-to-medium velocity as was shown by Eq. (36.4), the output voltage of an MR head is independent of
velocity.
