Multivibrators are classified according to the number of steady (stable) states of the circuit. A steady 
state exists when circuit operation is essentially constant; that is, one transistor remains in conduction and 
the other remains cut off until an external signal is applied. The three types of multivibrators are the 
ASTABLE, MONOSTABLE, and BISTABLE.
