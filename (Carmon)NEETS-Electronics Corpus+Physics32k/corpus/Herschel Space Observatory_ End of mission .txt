On 29 April 2013, ESA announced that Herschel's supply of liquid helium, used to cool the instruments and detectors on board, had been depleted, thus ending its mission. At the time of the announcement, Herschel was approximately 1.5 million km from Earth. Because Herschel's orbit at the L2 point is unstable, ESA wanted to guide the craft on a known trajectory. ESA managers considered two options:
Place Herschel into a Heliocentric orbit where it would not encounter Earth for at least several hundred years.
Guide Herschel on a course toward the Moon for a destructive high-speed collision that would help in the search for water at a lunar pole. Herschel would take about 100 days to reach the Moon.
The managers chose the first option because it was less costly.
On 17 June 2013, Herschel was fully deactivated, with its fuel tanks forcibly depleted and the onboard computer programmed to cease communications with Earth. The final command, which severed communications, was sent from European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) at 12:25 UTC.
The mission's post-operations phase will continue until 2017. The main tasks are consolidation and refinement of instrument calibration, to improve data quality, and data processing, to create a body of scientifically validated data.
Following Herschel's demise, some European astronomers have pushed for ESA participation in the Japanese-led SPICA far-infrared observatory project as well as ESA's continued partnership in NASA's James Webb Space Telescope. NASA's proposed SAFIR observatory would also observe in the far-infrared band of light.
