which is the expression for the resultant mmf wave. It has a constant amplitude 3/2 Fm, is a
sinusoidal function of the angle θ, and rotates in synchronism with the supply frequency; hence it
is called a rotating ﬁeld. The constant amplitude is 3/2 times the maximum contribution Fm of any
one phase. The angular velocity of the wave is ωs = 2πfs electrical radians per second, where
fs is the frequency of the electric supply in hertz. For a P-pole machine, the rotational speed is
given by
