The electronic frequency counter is a high-speed electronic counter with an accurate, crystal-
controlled time base. This combination provides a frequency counter that automatically counts and
displays the number of events occurring in a precise time interval. The frequency counter itself does not
generate any signal; it merely counts the recurring pulses fed to it.
