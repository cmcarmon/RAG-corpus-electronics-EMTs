If the office of Governor ever becomes vacant or if the incumbent Governor is absent from the Falklands or unable to perform his or her duties, the Queen, on the advice of her Secretary of State, can appoint an Acting Governor under section 24 of the constitution. The Acting Governor must take the oath before assuming office and has all the powers and duties of the Governor until a new Governor is appointed or the incumbent Governor is able to carry on with his or her duties.
