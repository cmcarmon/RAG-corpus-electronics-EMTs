Torque is simply a measure of how much load a machine can turn. In torque synchros, only small 
loads are turned; therefore, only a small amount of torque is required. The measure of torque is the 
product of the applied force and the distance between the point of application and the center of rotation. 
For instance, if a 3 ounce weight is suspended from a synchro pulley having a radius of 2 inches, the 
torque required to move the weight is 6 ounce-inches. In heavy machinery, torque may be expressed in 
pound-feet, but torque synchro measurements are in ounce-inches.
