 
The  impedance  representation  once  again  unifies  resistors,  capacitors,  and 
inductors  as  equivalent  circuit  components  with  specific  impedances  and  the  s-domain 
transfer function can be found by using KVL and KCL. The transfer function is generally 
expressed as a ratio of polynomials such that
