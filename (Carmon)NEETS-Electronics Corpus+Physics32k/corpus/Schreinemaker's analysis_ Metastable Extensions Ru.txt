From the Morey-Schreinemaker Coincidence Theorem, Schreinemaker's Rules can be determined. These rules can be used in the creation of an accurate phase diagram where both axes are intensive thermodynamic variables.
There are many correct collections of "Schreinemaker's Rules" and the choice to use a given set of rules depends on the nature of the phase diagrams being created. Due to the phrasing of the Morey-Schreinemaker Coincidence Theorem, only one rule is essential to the Schreinemaker's Rules. This is the so-called metastable extensions rule:

The metastable extension of the [phase-absent] reaction must fall in the sector in which that phase is stable in all possible assemblages.

This rule is geometrically sound in the construction of phase diagrams since for every metastable reaction, there must be a phase that is relatively stable. This phase must be the one which does not participate in the reaction and is therefore not consumed as a reactant or formed as a product, thus being "stable."
Some collections of Schreinemaker's Rules will contain the following, additional, basic statements:
No assemblage has a stability area greater than 180Â°.
All reactants and products are stable in the field where the reaction plots.
The absent phase is unstable where the reaction plots.
Complex reactions (high number of participating phases) usually lie within bounding, simple reactions defining the phase stability region.
The simplest divariant region usually contains the most metastable extensions.
If each stable and metastable reaction curve is labeled with the absent phase, then the order of the named curves as you proceed around the invariant point should cycle through all phases twice in order of their relative reaction components.
