Formal  inspections  of  the  kind  just  discussed  have  the  highest  measured  efﬁciency  of  any  kind  of  defect
removal  operation  yet  observed.  For  inspections  of  plans,  speciﬁcations,  and  documents  the  defect  removal
efﬁciency of formal inspections can exceed 65%. Formal inspections of source code listings can exceed 60%.
Formal inspections are rather expensive, but extremely valuable and cost-effective. Not only do inspections
achieve high rates of defect removal efﬁciency, but they are also effective against both errors of omission and
errors of clarity or ambiguity, which are extremely difﬁcult to ﬁnd via testing. Formal inspections also operate
as a defect prevention mechanism. Those who participate in the inspection process obviously learn a great deal
about the kinds of defects encountered. These observations are kept in memory and usually lead to spontaneous
reductions in potential defects within a few months of the adoption of formal inspections.
