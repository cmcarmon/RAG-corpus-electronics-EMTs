Line 3 uses 5-rail track, which a TTC document describes as follows:

Track is the 5 rail system on direct fixation and car is powered by an induction or “reaction rail” situated between the running rails at the same top of rail elevation. There are two side contacting power rails +300V and −300V respectively situated a distance of about 14 in. from the closest gauge line of one running rail.

The two power rails of 300 volts positive DC and the other of 300 volts negative DC together produce 600 volts.
