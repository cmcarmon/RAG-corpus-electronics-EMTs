A	multimeter,	also	called	a	multitester,	Volt-Ohm	millimeter,	and	Volt-Ohm	meter,
is	an	electronic	device	that	measures	the	electric	current	in	a	circuit;	it	is	capable	of
measuring	voltage,	resistance,	and	a	variety	of	other	units	in	a	circuit’s	system.	To
know	how	to	use	the	device,	it’s	important	to	be	familiar	with	each	of	its
components;	if	you	can	understand	how	the	components	work,	you	can	also
understand	the	operations	of	the	entire	device.
