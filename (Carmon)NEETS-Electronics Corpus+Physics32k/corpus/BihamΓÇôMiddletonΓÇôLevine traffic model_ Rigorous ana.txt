Despite the simplicity of the model, rigorous analysis is very nontrivial. Nonetheless, there have been mathematical proofs regarding the Biham–Middleton–Levine traffic model. Proofs so far have been restricted to the extremes of traffic density. In 2005, Alexander Holroyd et al proved that for densities sufficiently close to one, the system will have no cars moving infinitely often. In 2006, Tim Austin and Itai Benjamini proved that the model will always reach the free-flowing phase if the number of cars is less than half the edge length for a square lattice.
It would be ideal to formulate a rigorous method to predict the end result of any starting position, especially in the intermediate phases. To that end, this model has been the subject of research for several scientists.
