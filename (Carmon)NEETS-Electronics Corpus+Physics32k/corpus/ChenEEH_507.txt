FIGURE 6.4 The Face-Centered Cubic (fcc) and Diamond Structure. This structure is formed by two interpenetrating fcc lattices shifted by
one quarter of the body diagonal. Thick lines show the bonds formed between an atom and its four nearest neighbors (tetrahedral bond
conÔ¨Åguration). Figure adapted From Shur (1996).
