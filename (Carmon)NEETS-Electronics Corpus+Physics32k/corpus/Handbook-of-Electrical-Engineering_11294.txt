Design
The pacemaker must be able to reliably detect the wavefronts on the atria and the ventricles, determine their
rate, determine if the chambers are synchronized, and intervene in the appropriate chamber if these conditions
are  not  met.  Some  patients  may  receive  continuous  pacing,  while  others  may  rarely  need  pacing  at  all.  The
pacemaker must perform over a period of greater than 5 years, in all types of environments, with maximum
reliability, and using the smallest, most comfortable design possible. In addition, it must be adaptable to various
types of patients through remotely programmable parameters and informative diagnostics. A pacemaker system
is  made  up  of  three  major  components,  including  the  leads,  the  pulse  generator,  and  the  programmer.  The
pulse generator (i.e., the pacemaker itself) houses all of the controlling and pacing electronics in a biologically
compatible  titanium  shell.  The  leads  provide  the  electrical  link  from  the  pulse  generator  to  the  heart.  The
programmer allows the physician to remotely program the pacemaker parameters and assess pacemaker func-
tion through a telemetry system.
