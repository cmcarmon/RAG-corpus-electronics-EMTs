Near the junction interface, electrons from the N-type region diffuse into the P-
type  region  while  holes  from  the  P-type  region  diffuse  into  the  N-type  region.  The 
diffused electrons and holes remain in a thin boundary layer around the junction known 
as the depletion layer shown in Figure 6.3. The excess of positive and negative charges 
create a strong electric field at the junction which acts as a potential barrier that prevent 
electrons  from  entering  the  P-type  region  and  holes  from  entering  the  N-type  region.
