To  implement  algorithm  (14.133),  we  ﬁrst  generate  the  rank-q  approximation  of  the  data  matrix  X.  The
corresponding  matrix  P(q)(X)  is  generally  found  to  be  non-Toeplitz  in  structure.  To  recover  the  prerequisite
Toeplitz structure, we next apply projection operator PT to matrix P(q)(X) to complete the ﬁrst iteration of the
signal restoration algorithm. It is generally found that this new Toeplitz-structured data matrix X1 = PTP(q)(X)
has full rank. It is closer to a rank-q matrix, however, than was the original data matrix X. The ﬁrst iteration
has therefore led to a data matrix whose elements comprise a data sequence that is more compatible with a
qth-order exponential model. Often, this ﬁrst iteration is sufﬁcient in many modeling applications.
