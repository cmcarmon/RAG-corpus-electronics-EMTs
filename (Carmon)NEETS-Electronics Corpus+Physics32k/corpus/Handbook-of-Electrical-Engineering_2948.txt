1. A high voltage gain, down to and including dc, and a dc open loop gain of perhaps 105 (100 dB) or more
2. An inverting (â€“) and noninverting (+) symbol
3. Minimized dc offsets, a high input impedance, and a low output impedance
4. An output stage able to deliver or absorb currents over a dynamic range approaching the power supply
