Now let us suppose that R2 fails shorted. Shorted means that the resistor now acts like a
straight piece of wire, with little or no resistance. The circuit will behave as though a ”jumper”
wire were connected across R2 (in case you were wondering, ”jumper wire” is a common term
for a temporary wire connection in a circuit). What causes the shorted condition of R2 is no
matter to us in this example; we only care about its effect upon the circuit:
