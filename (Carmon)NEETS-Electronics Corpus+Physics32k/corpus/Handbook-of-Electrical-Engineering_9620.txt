Each  component  of  the  computer  system,  both  hardware  and  software,  must  be  specially  built  to  handle
failures. It should also be obvious that a fault-tolerant system must have redundant hardware. If, for example,
a disk controller should fail, there must be another controller communicating with the disks that can take over.
One problem with implementing a fault-tolerant system is knowing when something has failed. If a circuit
board  totally  ceases  operation,  we  can  determine  the  failure  by  its  lack  of  response  to  commands.  Another
failure  mode  exists  where  the  failing  component  appears  to  work  but  is  operating  incorrectly.  A  common
mechanism. By implementing three hardware replicas the system
approach to detect this problem is a 
can detect when any one has failed by its producing output inconsistent with the other two. In that case, the
output of the two components in agreement is used.
