where VAF is  the  forward  Early  voltage,  VÂ¢
CEQ is  the  quiescent  voltage  developed  across  the  internal  collector-
emitter terminals, and IKF symbolizes the forward knee current. The knee current is a measure of the onset of
high injection effects [Gummel and Poon, 1970] in the base. In particular, a collector current numerically equal
to  IKF implies  that  the  forward  biasing  of  the  emitter-base  junction  promotes  a  net  minority  carrier  charge
injected into the base from the emitter that is equal to the background majority charge in the neutral base. The
Early voltage is an inverse measure of the slope of the common emitter output characteristic curves.
