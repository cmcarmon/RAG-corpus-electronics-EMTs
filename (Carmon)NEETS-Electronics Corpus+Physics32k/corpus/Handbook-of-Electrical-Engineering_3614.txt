For isotropic or anisotropic media, the constitutive relations relate the two electric ﬁeld vectors and the two
magnetic ﬁeld vectors by either a scalar or a tensor. Such media become polarized when placed in an electric
ﬁeld  and  become  magnetized  when  placed  in  a  magnetic  ﬁeld.  A  bianisotropic  medium  provides  the  cross
coupling between the electric and magnetic ﬁelds. The constitutive relations for a bianisotropic medium can
be written as
