When a beam of radiated energy that is noticeably wider in one cross-sectional dimension than in 
another is desired, a cylindrical paraboloidal section which approximates a rectangle can be used. Figure 
3-7 illustrates such an antenna. A PARABOLIC CYLINDER has a parabolic cross section in just one 
dimension which causes the reflector to be directive in one plane only. The cylindrical paraboloid 
reflector is fed either by a linear array of dipoles, a slit in the side of a waveguide, or by a thin waveguide 
radiator. It also has a series of focal points forming a straight line rather than a single focal point. Placing 
the radiator, or radiators, along this focal line produces a directed beam of energy. As the width of the 
parabolic section is changed, different beam shapes are obtained. You may see this type of antenna 
system used in search radar systems and in ground control approach (gca) radar systems.
