Temperature also affects the resistance of an electri‑
cal conductor. In most conductors (copper, aluminum, 
and so on), resistance increases with temperature. 
 Carbon is an exception because the resistance de‑
creases as temperature increases. Certain alloys of 
metals (Manganin and Constantan) have resistance 
that does not change with temperature.
