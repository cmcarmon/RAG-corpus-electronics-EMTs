An ohmmeter measures the resistance of a circuit or 
component by applying a known voltage. Batteries 
supply the voltage. When a constant voltage is  applied 
to the meter circuit through the component under 
test, the pointer is deflected based on the current flow. 
The meter deflection varies with the resistance  being 
 measured. To measure the resistance of a circuit or 
component, the ohmmeter is connected in parallel 
with the circuit or component.
