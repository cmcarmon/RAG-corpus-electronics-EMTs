For six minutes each half hour, from 10–16 and 40–46 minutes past each hour, one-minute frames are replaced by a special extended time frame. Rather than transmitting 35 bits of information in one minute, this transmits 7 bits (time of day and DST status only) over 6 minutes, giving 30 times as much energy per transmitted bit, a 14.8 dB improvement in the link budget compared to the standard one-minute time code.
The 360-bit code word consists of three parts:
A 127-bit sequence (generated by a 7-bit LFSR), rotated left by a variable amount to encode a value from 0 to 123.
A 106-bit fixed bit sequence.
The 127-bit reverse of the initial sequence. Because it is reversed, it is effectively rotated in the opposite direction.
The only information transmitted is the time within the day (one of 48 half hours), plus the current U.S. daylight saving time status, making 2×48 = 96 possible time codes.
An additional 2×14 = 28 time codes are transmitted between 04:10 and 10:46 UTC on days when daylight saving time is changing, providing several hours' warning of an imminent DST change.
