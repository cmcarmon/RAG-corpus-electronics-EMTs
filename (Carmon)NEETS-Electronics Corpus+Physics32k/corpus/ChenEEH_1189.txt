To reduce the number of transitions, the offset is en-
coded in a one-hot code. Because the one-hot code
produces two transitions if the previous reference was
also in the one-hot code and an average of n/2 transi-
tions when the previous reference is arbitrary, using
a transition-signaling code reduces the number of
transitions (Musoll et al., 1998).
