Signals from moving targets, however, will have a varying phase relationship with the transmitted
pulse. As a result, the signals from successive receiving periods produce signals of different amplitudes in
the phase detector. When such signals are combined, the difference in signal amplitude provides a video
signal that is sent to the indicator system for display.
