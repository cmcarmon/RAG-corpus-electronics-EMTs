In  the  horsepower  range  above  about  10,000  hp,  three-phase  synchronous  motors  with  wound  ﬁelds  are
used rather than large squirrel cage induction motors. Starting current and other characteristics can be con-
trolled  by  the  external  ﬁeld  exciter.  Three-phase  synchronous  motors  with  wound  ﬁelds  are  available  up  to
about 50,000 hp.
