In addition to modeling difﬁculties, it should be realized that the digital simulation of a system can seldom
be made perfectly consistent with the actual system under study. The simulation is affected by phenomena not
present in the actual system. Examples are the aliasing errors resulting from the sampling operation and the
ﬁnite  word  length  (quantization)  effects  present  in  the  simulation.  Practical  communication  systems  use  a
number of ﬁlters, and modeling the analog ﬁlters present in the actual system by the digital ﬁlters required by
the simulation involves a number of approximations. The assumptions and approximations used in modeling
an analog ﬁlter using impulse-invariant digital ﬁlter synthesis techniques are quite different from the assump-
z
-transform  techniques.  Determining  the  appropriate  modeling
tions  and  approximations  used  in  bilinear 
technique requires careful thought.
