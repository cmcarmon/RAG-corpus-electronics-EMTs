The search for an adequate thermal packaging strategy generally begins with consideration of passive transfer
modes—conduction, natural convection, and radiation, which require no external motive power and no moving
parts. Due to its near-universal availability, air is the most common and preferred cooling ﬂuid. Many electronic
systems  can  be  successfully  cooled  by  passive  means  and  especially  by  natural  convection  in  air. When  such
passive means are incapable of properly controlling the heat source temperature, the designer must examine
the use of active thermal control techniques, including blown air, pumped water, and circulated refrigerants.
Immersion of the electronic components directly in dielectric liquids, which can then be pumped or allowed
to circulate naturally, provides an additional, though less common, alternative.
