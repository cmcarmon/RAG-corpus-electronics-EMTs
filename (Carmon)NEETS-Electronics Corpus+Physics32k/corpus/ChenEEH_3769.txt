Training using the Viterbi algorithm is much simpler and
more computationally efÔ¨Åcient,
though equally effective.
Beginning with an initial model estimate, we implement the
recognition procedure on the training sequence. Once the
optimal path is discovered, backtracking information is used
to determine the number of transitions into and out of each
state and the number of times each symbol is produced in each
state. The tallies are used to reestimate the state and observa-
tion probabilities, and then the process is repeated. The
algorithm can be shown to converge to a proper characteriza-
tion of the underlying probabilities (Fu, 1982).
