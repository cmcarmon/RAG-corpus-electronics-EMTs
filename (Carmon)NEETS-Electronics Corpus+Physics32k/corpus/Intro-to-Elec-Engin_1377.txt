Today digital communication systems are in common use, carrying the bulk of our daily
information transmission through a variety of communication media, such as wire-line telephone
channels, microwave radio, Ô¨Åber-optic channels, and satellite channels. Even the current analog
AM and FM radio and television broadcasts will be replaced in the near future by digital transmis-
sion systems. High-speed integrated circuits (ICs), programmable digital signal processing chips,
microelectronic IC fabrication, and sophisticated digital modulation techniques have certainly
helped digital communications as a means of transmitting information.
