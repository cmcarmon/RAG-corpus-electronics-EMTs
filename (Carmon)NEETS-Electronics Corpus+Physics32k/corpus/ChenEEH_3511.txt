A signal is a mathematical function of one or more inde-
pendent variables that usually represent time and/or space. An
example of a signal as a function of time is a speech signal that
represents a variation of acoustic pressure with time. An
example of a signal as a function of space is an image: it is a
function of light intensity and color in two spatial coordinates.
Some signals may depend both on space and time. Examples
are video signals or the measurements of temperature in a
room that depend on the three spatial coordinates deÔ¨Åning
each point in the room and that also vary with time.
