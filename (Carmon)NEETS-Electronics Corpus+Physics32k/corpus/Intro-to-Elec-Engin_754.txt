VDD = 24 V and for the JFET VP = 3.5 V and
IDSS = 5 mA.
8.2.2 An n-channel JFET having VP = 3.5 V and
IDSS = 5 mA is biased by the circuit of Figure
8.2.1 with VDD = 28 V, RS = 3000 , and
R2 = 100 k. If the operating point is given by
IDQ = 2 mA and VDSQ = 12 V, determine VG,
RD, and R1.
*8.2.3 A self-biasing method for the JFET is shown in
Figure P8.2.3. The JFET has VP = 3 V and
IDSS = 24 mA. It is to operate at an active-
region Q point that is given by IDQ = 5 mA and
VDSQ = 8 V. Determine RS and RD so that the
desired Q point is achieved with VDD = 16 V.
8.2.4 An n-channel depletion MOSFET that has VP = 3
V and IDSS = 3 mA (when VDS = 10 V) is biased
by the circuit of Figure 8.2.1 with VDD = 20 V
and R2 = 1M. If the operating point is given
by IDQ = 3 mA and VDSQ = 10 V, and 40% of
the voltage drop across RD and RS is across RS,
determine RS, RD, VG, and R1.
