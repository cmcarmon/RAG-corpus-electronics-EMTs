A metallic strip is twisted and fixed between two ends as shown. Any longitudinal movement (in either direction) will cause the central portion of the strip to rotate. One end of the strip is fixed to an adjustable cantilever and the other end is fixed to the spring elbow. The spring elbow, in turn, is connected to a plunger, which moves upwards or downwards. The spring elbow, which consists of flexible strips and a stiff diagonal acts as a bell crank lever and causes the twisted strip to change length whenever there is a movement in the plunger. This change in length will result in a proportional amount of twist of the metallic strip. The magnification can be varied by changing the length of the spring elbow.
