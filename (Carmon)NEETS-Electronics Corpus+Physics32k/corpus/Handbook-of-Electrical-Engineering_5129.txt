The inherent intelligence and self-adaptable control of artiÔ¨Åcial smart materials should be programmable in
terms of the constituent processing, microstructural characteristics, and defects to permit the self-conditionings
to adapt in a controlled manner to various types of stimuli. The dividing line between smart materials and the
  is  not,  however,  distinct.  In  simple  terms,  intelligent  material  systems  are
so-called 
constructed of smart materials with a dedicated, discrete set of integrated actuators, sensors, and so on, and
smart
smart materials contain largely a built-in or embedded set of distributed sensors. In general, the term 
 usually connotes the structural constituent in which the discrete functions of sensing, actuation, signal
materials
processing  and  control  are  tangibly  integrated.  Intelligent  structures,  as  an  extension,  are  constructed  with
smart materials to respond to the environment around them in a predetermined, desired manner.
