In fact, it can be shown that this method gives the best linear time-invariant model of the (possibly time varying
and nonlinear) system in the sense that the time-averaged mean-square error between the outputs of the actual
system  and  of  the  model,  when  both  are  subjected  to  the  same  input,  is  minimized  [see  Gardner,  1990,
pp. 282â€“286].
