Pulse-Code Modulation (PCM)
PCM is the simplest and oldest waveform coding scheme for processing an analog signal by
sampling, quantizing, and binary encoding. Figure 15.3.6 shows a functional block diagram of
a PCM system transmitter. In order to guarantee that the message is band-limited to the spectral
extent for which the system is designed, a low-pass ﬁlter is introduced. The compressor is rather
optional for better performance. Let us assume that the PCM signal is transmitted directly over
the baseband channel. Corrupted by the noise generated within the receiver, the PCM signal is
shown as the input to the PCM reconstruction function in Figure 15.3.7, which depicts a block
diagram of functions (including an optional expandor) needed to receive PCM. The operations of
the receiver are basically the inverse of those in the transmitter. The ﬁrst and most critical receiver
operation is to reconstruct the originally transmitted PCM signal as nearly as possible from the
noise-contaminated received waveform. The effect of noise is to be minimized through a careful
selection of circuit implementation.
