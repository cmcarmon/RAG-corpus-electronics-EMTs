latch
To maintain a closed (energized) state in a pair of relay contacts after initial energization from a single electrical pulse.
latching relay
A relay which locks into the mode (on or off) for which it is energized, and requires a start-stop button. Once activated, it stays activated until the setpoint is reached or the stop button is pushed.
lever

A tool, often used with a fulcrum, that transfers force equally with reduction or multiplication.

light-emitting diode (LED)

A semiconductor light source that emits visible light or invisible infrared radiation.

linearity
The quality of delivering identical sensitivity throughout the weighing capacity of a scale or balance.
linearity calibration
A method that minimizes deviation between actual and displayed weights within the weighing range of the scale. It utilizes three calibration points, one at zero, center span and full span.
linearity test
A test that measures an instrument's ability to have consistent sensitivity throughout the weighing range.
liquid crystal display (LCD)
A thin, flat electronic visual display that uses the light modulating properties of liquid crystals (LCs), which do not emit light directly.
live load
The load applied to a scale base that is actually being measured by the weighing system.
structural load

The amount of weight or force that is applied to the load cell.

load cell

A device that produces an output signal which is proportional to the weight or force applied. Types of load cells include beam, S-beam, platform, compression and tension.

low-pass filter

A filter that passes frequency components below a designated frequency and rejects components above that frequency.
