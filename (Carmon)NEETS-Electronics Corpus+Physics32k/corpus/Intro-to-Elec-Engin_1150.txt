The single-phase stator winding is distributed in slots so as to produce an approximately
sinusoidal space distribution of mmf. As discussed in Section 13.1, such a motor inherently has
no starting torque, and as we saw in Section 12.3, it must be started by an auxiliary winding, by
being displaced in phase position from the main winding, or by some similar device. Once started
by auxiliary means, the motor will continue to run. Thus, nearly all single-phase induction motors
are actually two-phase motors, with the main winding in the direct axis adapted to carry most or
all of the current in operation, and an auxiliary winding in the quadrature axis with a different
number of turns adapted to provide the necessary starting torque.
