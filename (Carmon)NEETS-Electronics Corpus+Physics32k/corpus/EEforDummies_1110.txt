Ohm my! It’s an ohmmeter, too!
You can measure the resistance of an individual component or an entire cir-
cuit (measured in ohms, as detailed in Chapter 5) with your multimeter func-
tioning as an ohmmeter. You use this function to check up on wires, resistors, 
motors, and many other components. You always test resistance with the 
circuit unpowered. If the circuit is powered, current flowing through it can 
invalidate the resistance readings — or damage the meter.
