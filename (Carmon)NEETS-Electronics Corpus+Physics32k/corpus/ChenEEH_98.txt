Cut Matrix
Consider a cut (Va, Vb) in a connected directed graph G with
n vertices and m edges. Recall that < Va, Vb > consists of all
those edges connecting vertices in Va to Vb. This cut may be
assigned an orientation from Va to Vb or from Vb to Va.
Suppose the orientation of (Va, Vb) is from Va to Vb. Then
the orientation of an edge (vi, vj) is said to agree with the cut
orientation if vi 2 Va, and vj 2 Vb.
