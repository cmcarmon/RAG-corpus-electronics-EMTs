The character set that can be displayed on a device's formatted screen is stored in ROMs or PROMS. 
That is, the dot-matrix (picture element) patterns for each individual character to be displayed are stored. 
Different character sets may be displayed by simply replacing the appropriate ROM or PROM chips with 
new chips containing different character patterns.
