The Chernobyl Nuclear Incident is one of the most notable nuclear disasters. The current containment building, known as the sarcophagus, does not classify as a proper entombment device. However, due to lack of repair and maintenance, because of extremely high levels of radiation, a new tomb is in the process of construction and will be considered a proper tomb. Upon completion in 2017 the structure will measure 110 meters tall and span 260 meters. The main arch will be composed of triple-layered radiation resistant panels made up of stainless steel coated in polycarbonate, this will provide the shielding necessary for radioactive containment. The structure will weigh over 30,000 tons and completely cover Reactor number 4. This new tomb is designed to last over 100 years and has special ventilation and temperature systems to prevent condensation of radioactive fluids on the inside which could result in a compromised containment. Overall this new containment structure will act as band-aid and only buy time for the Ukrainian Government to develop ways of properly cleaning up the site.
