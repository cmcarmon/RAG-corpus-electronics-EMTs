• Circuit Breakers and Fuses—Covers for all fuse boxes, junction boxes, switch boxes, and wiring
accessories should be kept closed. Any cover which is not closed or is missing should be
reported to the technician responsible for its maintenance. Failure to do so may result in injury to
personnel or damage to equipment in the event accidental contact is made with exposed live
circuits.
