The pilottone system is now obsolete. In the film world the virtually universal use of crystal controlled motors on cameras and digital audio recorders with crystal controlled sampling frequencies assures synchronization of the time base between picture and sound.
In such a situation where the speed of the camera and the recorder are absolutely free of any variation there remains no need for a synchronization pulse cable to run between the camera and the recorder. This has made the work of a sound man much simpler. It also gave more freedom of movement to the camera at the time of motion picture filming.
Additionally the use of SMPTE time code on source recordings simplifies finding match points in post production between picture and audio in both the film and television worlds.
