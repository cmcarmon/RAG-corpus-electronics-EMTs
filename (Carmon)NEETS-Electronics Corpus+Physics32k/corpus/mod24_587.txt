The CUTOFF WAVELENGTH of a single mode fiber is the wavelength above which the fiber
propagates only the fundamental mode. The cutoff wavelength of a single mode fiber varies according to
the fiber's radius of curvature and length. The fiber cutoff wavelength ( l cf) will generally be higher than
the cable cutoff wavelength ( l cc).
