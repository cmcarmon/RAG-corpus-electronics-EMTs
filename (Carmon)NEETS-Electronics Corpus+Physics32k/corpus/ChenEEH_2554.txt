The requirements for power dividing on the component
design may be quite different from power combining even
though the same component may posses both functions. This
is because only a single input signal is concerned in the divider
while two signals are simultaneously injected at the parallel-
ports of the combiner, and these signals are not necessarily
equal in magnitude and in phase. This may cause a serious
problem of power or signal unbalance in the combiner junc-
tion. The added resistor, however, ensures that the two output/
input ports are electrically isolated.
