Strong inversion: The range of gate biases corresponding to the “on” condition of the MOSFET. At a ﬁxed
gate bias in this region, for low drain-to-source biases the MOSFET behaves as a simple gate-controlled
resistor. At larger drain biases, the channel resistance can increase with drain bias, even to the point that
the current saturates, or becomes independent of drain bias.
