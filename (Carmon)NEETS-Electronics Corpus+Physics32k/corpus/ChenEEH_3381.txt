for i ¼ N þ 1, . . . , M. The power ﬂow variables, namely the
bus voltages VNþ1, . . ., VM and phase angles d2, . . ., dN
become the dependent variables in the optimization proced-
ure. In general, there may exist inequality constraints on the
control variables as well as the state variables in the optimal
power ﬂow formulation.
