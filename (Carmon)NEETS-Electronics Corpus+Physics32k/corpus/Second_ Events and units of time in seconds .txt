Fractions of a second are usually denoted in decimal notation, i.e. 2.01 seconds, or two and one hundredth seconds. Multiples of seconds are usually expressed as minutes and seconds, or hours, minutes and seconds of clock time, separated by colons, such as 11:23:24, or 45:23 (the latter notation can give rise to ambiguity, because the same notation is used to denote hours and minutes). It rarely makes sense to express longer periods of time like hours or days in seconds, because they are awkwardly large numbers. For the metric unit of second, there are decimal prefixes representing 10−24 to 1024 seconds.
Some common units of time in seconds are: an hour is 3600 seconds; a day is 86,400 seconds, a week is 604,800 seconds; a year is about 31.6 million seconds; and a century is a little over 3 billion (3.16×109) seconds.
Some common events in seconds are: a stone falls about 4.9 meters from rest in one second; a pendulum of length about one meter has a swing of one second, so pendulum clocks have pendulums about a meter long; the fastest human sprinters run 10 meters in a second; an ocean wave in deep water travels about 23 meters in one second; sound travels about 343 meters in one second in air; light takes a fraction over one second to reach Earth from the surface of the Moon.
