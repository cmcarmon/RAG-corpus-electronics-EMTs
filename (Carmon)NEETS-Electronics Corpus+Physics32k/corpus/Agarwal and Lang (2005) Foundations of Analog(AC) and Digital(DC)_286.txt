Before we return to the specific problem of analyzing the electrical network
shown in Figure 2.1, let us first develop the systematic method using a few
simpler circuits and build up our insight into the technique. We saw previously
that under the lumped matter discipline, Maxwell’s Equations reduce to the
basic element laws and the algebraic KVL and KCL. Accordingly, a systematic
solution of the network involves the assembly and subsequent joint solution
of two sets of equations. The first set of equations comprise the constituent
relations for the individual elements in the network. The second set of equations
results from the application of Kirchhoff’s current and voltage laws.
