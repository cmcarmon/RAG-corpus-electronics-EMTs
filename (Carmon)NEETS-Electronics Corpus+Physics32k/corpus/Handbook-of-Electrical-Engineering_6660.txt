Access lines provide for data transmission between the terminals and the network switching nodes. These
connections may be set up on a permanent basis or they may be switched connections, and there are numerous
transmission schemes and protocols available to manage these connections. The essence of these connections,
however, from our point of view is a channel that provides data transmission at some number of bits per second
. The access line capacities may range from a few hundred bits per second
(bps), called the channel capacity, 
to in excess of millions of bits per second, and they are usually not the same for all terminating equipments of
a given network. The actual information-carrying capacity of the link depends upon the protocols employed
to effect the transfer; the interested reader is referred to Bertsekas and Gallagher [1987], especially Chapter 2,
for a general discussion of the issues involved in transmission of data over communication links.
