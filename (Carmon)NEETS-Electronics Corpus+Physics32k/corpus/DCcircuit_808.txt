Each of the four resistances in a bridge circuit are referred to as arms. The resistor in series
with the unknown resistance Rx (this would be Ra in the above schematic) is commonly called
the rheostat of the bridge, while the other two resistors are called the ratio arms of the bridge.
Accurate and stable resistance standards, thankfully, are not that difﬁcult to construct. In
fact, they were some of the ﬁrst electrical ”standard” devices made for scientiﬁc purposes. Here
is a photograph of an antique resistance standard unit:
