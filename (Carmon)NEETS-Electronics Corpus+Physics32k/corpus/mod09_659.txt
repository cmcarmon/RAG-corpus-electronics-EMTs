Reversing the connections of diodes D1 and D2 in the positive-counter circuit (view (A) of figure 4-
43) will cause the circuit to respond to negative pulses and become a negative-counter circuit. Diode D2 
conducts during the time the negative pulse is applied and current flows in the opposite direction through 
R1, as was indicated by the arrow. At the end of the negative pulse, D1 conducts and discharges C1. The 
current through R1 increases with an increase in pulse frequency as before. However, if the voltage 
developed across R1 is applied to the same control circuit, as shown in view (A) of figure 4-44, the 
increase in current will be in a negative direction and the amplifier will conduct less. Thus, the effect is 
opposite to that of the positive counter.
