A variety of methods to calculate the update term have been
reported. The advantage of one method over another is mainly
in the improvement in compression. It should be noted that pel
recursive  algorithms  assume  that  the  displacement  to  be  esti-
mated is small. If the displacement is large, the estimates will be
poor. Noise can also affect the accuracy of the estimate.
