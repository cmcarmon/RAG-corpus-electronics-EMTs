The fabrication and experimental studies of the properties of the nonlinear tunable magnetic metamaterial operating at microwave frequencies. Varactor diodes are symmetrically introduced, which results in dynamic tunability for the whole structure. Since the magnetic component of the interaction determines the application, the power dependency is demonstrated. Nonlinearity-dependent enhancement or suppression of the transmission is turns out to be dynamcially tunable.
