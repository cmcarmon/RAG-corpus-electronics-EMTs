In  urban  areas,  an  underground  cable  system  is  used.  The  switchgear  and  transformers  are  placed  in
underground vaults or ground-level cabinets. The underground system is not affected by weather and is highly
reliable. Unfortunately, the initial cost of an underground cable is signiÔ¨Åcantly higher than an overhead line
with the same capacity. The high cost limits the underground system to high-density urban areas and housing
developments. Flooding can be a problem.
