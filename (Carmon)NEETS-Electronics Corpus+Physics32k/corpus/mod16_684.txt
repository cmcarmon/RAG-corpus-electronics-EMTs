Special current probes have been designed to use the electromagnetic fields produced by a current as
it travels through a conductor. This type of probe is clamped around a conductor without disconnecting it
from the circuit. The current probe is electrically insulated from the conductor, but the magnetic fields
about the conductor induce a potential in the current probe that is proportional to the current through the
conductor. Thus, the vertical deflection of the oscilloscope display will be directly proportional to the
current through the conductor.
