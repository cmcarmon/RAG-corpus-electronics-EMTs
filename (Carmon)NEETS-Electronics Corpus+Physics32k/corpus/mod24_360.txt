Coupling loss caused by lateral and angular misalignment typically is greater than the loss caused by
fiber separation. Loss, caused by fiber separation, is less critical because of the relative ease in limiting
the distance of fiber separation. However, in some cases, fiber optic connectors prevent fibers from actual
contact. These fiber optic connectors separate the fibers by a small gap. This gap eliminates damage to
fiber-end faces during connection. For connectors with an air gap, the use of index matching gel reduces
the coupling loss.
