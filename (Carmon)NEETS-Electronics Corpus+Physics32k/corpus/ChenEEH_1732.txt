Apart from the Internet, cellular networks have also seen an
unprecedented growth in their usage [13] and consequent
demand for multimedia applications. The second generation
(2G) cellular systems like GSM, IS-95, IS-136 or PDC, which
offered circuit-switched voice services, are now evolving
towards third generation (3G) systems that are capable of
transmitting high-speed data, video, and multimedia trafÔ¨Åc
to mobile users. IMT-2000 is composed of several 3G stand-
ards under development by the International Telecommunica-
tion Union (ITU) that will provide enhanced voice, data, and
multimedia services over wireless networks. We will discuss
the layered QoS approach adopted by IMT-2000 to provide
end-to-end QoS guarantees.
