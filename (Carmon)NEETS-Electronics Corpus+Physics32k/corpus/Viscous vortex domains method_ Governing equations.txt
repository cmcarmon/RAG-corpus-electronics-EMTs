The VVD method is based on a theorem, that circulation in viscous fluid is conserved on contours travelling with speed

{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} =\mathbf {V} +\mathbf {V} _{d};~~~\mathbf {V} _{d}=-\nu {\dfrac {\nabla \mathbf {\Omega } }{|\mathbf {\Omega } |}};~~~\mathbf {\Omega } =[\nabla \times \mathbf {V} ]}
,
where V is fluid velocity, Vd — diffusion velocity, ν — kinematic viscosity. This theorem shows resemblance with Kelvin's circulation theorem, but it works for viscid flows.
Basing on this theorem, flow region with non-zero circulation is presented with number of domains (small regions with finite volumes), which move with velocity u and thus their circulation

remains constant. The actual boundaries of every domain are not tracked, but coordinates of the only tracking point in every domain is saved. Array of domains' coordinates and circulations is known either from boundary conditions or from initial conditions. Such a motion results in vorticity evolution and satisfies Navier-Stokes equations.
