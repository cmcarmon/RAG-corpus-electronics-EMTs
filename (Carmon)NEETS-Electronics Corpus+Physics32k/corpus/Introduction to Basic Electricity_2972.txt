When pure semiconductor material is subjected to 
a voltage, the free electrons are attracted to the positive 
terminal of the voltage source (Figure 28-5). The holes 
created by movement of the free electrons drift toward 
the negative terminal. As the free electrons flow into 
the positive terminal, an equal number leave the nega-
tive terminal. As the holes and electrons recombine, 
both holes and free electrons cease to exist.
