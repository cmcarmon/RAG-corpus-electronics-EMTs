where A1 and A2 are unknown constants that depend on the initial states of
the two capacitors. To find A1 and A2, two equations are required. The first
equation comes from the evaluation of v1 in Equation 12.247 at the initial time.
The second equation comes from the substitution of Equation 12.247 into
Equation 12.240 to determine v2 followed by the evaluation of v2 at the initial
time. The solution of the two equations yields A1 and A2; we will not carry
out the details here.
