Finally, measure the voltage across the LED. Place the red multimeter lead 
to the point where the LED connects with the resistor, and the black multi-
meter lead to the point where the LED connects to the negative side of the 
battery pack. See Figure 3-12. Was your voltage reading close to the one in 
the figure?
