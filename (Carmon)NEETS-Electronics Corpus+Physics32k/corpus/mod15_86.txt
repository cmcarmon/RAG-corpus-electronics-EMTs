Therefore, the number of times the polarity reverses each second is twice the excitation frequency, or 
120 times a second when a 60-Hz frequency is applied. Since the magnetic field of the electromagnet 
follows this alternating current, the bar magnet is attracted in one direction during one-half cycle (view A) 
and in the other direction during the next half cycle (view B). Because of its inertia, the bar magnet 
cannot turn rapidly enough to follow the changing magnetic field and may line up with either end toward 
the coil (view C). This condition also causes weak rotor torque. For these reasons, the iron-bar rotor is not 
practical for ac applications. Therefore, it must be replaced by an electromagnetic rotor as illustrated in 
figure 1-12.
