control  in  ANC  is  in  active  hearing  protective  devices  (HPDs)  and  high-quality  headsets  and  “motional-
feedback”  loudspeakers. Passive  HPDs  offer  little  or  no  noise  attenuation  at  low  frequencies  due  to  inherent
physical limitations. Since the volume enclosed by earmuffs is rather small, HPDs can beneﬁt from the increase
in low-frequency attenuation brought about by feedback-control ANC. Finally, note that the same circuit can
be used for high-quality reproduction of a communications signal  s(t) fed into a headset by subtracting s(t)
electrically from e(t). The resulting transfer function is E/S = C(s)G(s)/[1 + C(s)G(s)] assuming Y(s) = 0. Thus,
a  high  loop  gain  *G(s)*  will  ensure  both,  a  high  noise  attenuation  at  low  frequencies  and  a  faithful  bass
reproduction of the communications signal.
