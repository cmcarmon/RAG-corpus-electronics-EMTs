It is often perplexing to new students of electronics why the time-constant calculation for an
inductive circuit is different from that of a capacitive circuit. For a resistor-capacitor circuit,
the time constant (in seconds) is calculated from the product (multiplication) of resistance
in ohms and capacitance in farads: τ =RC. However, for a resistor-inductor circuit, the time
constant is calculated from the quotient (division) of inductance in henrys over the resistance
in ohms: τ =L/R.
