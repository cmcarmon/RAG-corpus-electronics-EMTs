For atoms or molecules of a well-defined molar mass M (in kg/mol), the number density can be expressed in terms of their mass density ρm (in kg/m3) as




n
=



N


A



M



ρ


m



.


{\displaystyle n={\frac {N_{\rm {A}}}{M}}\rho _{\mathrm {m} }.}

Note that the ratio M/NA is the mass of a single atom or molecule in kg.
