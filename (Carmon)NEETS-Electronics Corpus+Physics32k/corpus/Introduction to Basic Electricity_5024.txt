Surface mount technology (SMT) has added more 
facets to printed circuit board layout. The parts are 
very small, and the lead pitch or spacing between 
the centers of adjacent leads can be very small. It 
is not possible to run any traces between the leads. 
This makes routing more difficult and increases the 
 number of vias.
