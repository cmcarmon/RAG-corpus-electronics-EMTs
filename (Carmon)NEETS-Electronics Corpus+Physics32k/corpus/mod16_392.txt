When an electrodynamometer is used as a voltmeter, no problems in construction are encountered
because the current required is not more than 0.1 ampere. This amount of current can be handled easily by
the spiral springs. When the electrodynamometer is used as a voltmeter, its internal connections and
construction are as shown in view A of figure 3-17. Fixed coils a and b are wound of fine wire since the
current flow through them will not exceed 0.1 ampere. They are connected directly in series with movable
coil c and the series current-limiting resistor.
