What are resistors used for?
Resistors are among the most popular electronic components around 
because they’re simple yet versatile. One of the most common uses of a 
 resistor is to limit the amount of current in part of a circuit. However, resis­
tors can also be used to control the amount of voltage provided to part of a 
circuit and to help create timing circuits.
