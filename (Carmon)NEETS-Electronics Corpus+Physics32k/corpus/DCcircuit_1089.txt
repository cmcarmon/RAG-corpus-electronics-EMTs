When alchemists succeeded in changing the properties of a substance by heat, light, friction,
or mixture with other substances, they were really observing changes in the types of molecules
formed by atoms breaking and forming bonds with other atoms. Chemistry is the modern
counterpart to alchemy, and concerns itself primarily with the properties of these chemical
bonds and the reactions associated with them.
