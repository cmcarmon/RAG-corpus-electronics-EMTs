Not only that, but having such a condition limits the usefulness of the device. If full left-
of-scale on the meter face represents an inﬁnite amount of resistance, then full right-of-scale
should represent zero. Currently, our design ”pegs” the meter movement hard to the right when
zero resistance is attached between the leads. We need a way to make it so that the movement
just registers full-scale when the test leads are shorted together. This is accomplished by
adding a series resistance to the meter’s circuit:
