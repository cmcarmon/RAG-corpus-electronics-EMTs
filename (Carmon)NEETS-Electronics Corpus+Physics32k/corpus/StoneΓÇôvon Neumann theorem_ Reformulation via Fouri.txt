Let G be a locally compact abelian group and G^ be the Pontryagin dual of G. The Fourier–Plancherel transform defined by

{\displaystyle f\mapsto {\hat {f}}(\gamma )=\int _{G}{\overline {\gamma (t)}}f(t)d\mu (t)}

extends to a C*-isomorphism from the group C*-algebra C*(G) of G and C0(G^), i.e. the spectrum of C*(G) is precisely G^. When G is the real line R, this is Stone's theorem characterizing one parameter unitary groups. The theorem of Stone–von Neumann can also be restated using similar language.
The group G acts on the C*-algebra C0(G) by right translation ρ: for s in G and f in C0(G),




(
s
⋅
f
)
(
t
)
=
f
(
t
+
s
)
.


{\displaystyle (s\cdot f)(t)=f(t+s).}

Under the isomorphism given above, this action becomes the natural action of G on C*(G^):

s

{\displaystyle {\widehat {(s\cdot f)}}(\gamma )=\gamma (s){\hat {f}}(\gamma ).}

So a covariant representation corresponding to the C*-crossed product

G


{\displaystyle C^{*}({\hat {G}})\rtimes _{\hat {\rho }}G}

is a unitary representation U(s) of G and V(γ) of G^ such that

{\displaystyle U(s)V(\gamma )U^{*}(s)=\gamma (s)V(\gamma ).}

It is a general fact that covariant representations are in one-to-one correspondence with *-representation of the corresponding crossed product. On the other hand, all irreducible representations of

, the compact operators on L2(G)). Therefore, all pairs {U(s), V(γ)} are unitarily equivalent. Specializing to the case where G = R yields the Stone–von Neumann theorem.
