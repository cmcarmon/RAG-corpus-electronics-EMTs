Energy available in many forms is often converted to and from electrical form because electric
energy can be transmitted and controlled simply, reliably, and efﬁciently. Among the energy-
conversion devices, electromechanical energy converters are the most important. Electromechan-
ical energy conversion involves the interchange of energy between an electric system and a
mechanical system, while using magnetic ﬁeld as a means of conversion.
