In this algorithm, Pk designates the projection operator corresponding to the set of signals possessing attribute
k while xn denotes the enhanced signal at the  nth iteration in which the initial point is xo = x. In this section,
we will give a historical perspective on the evolution of the method of successive projections as well as provide
implementations of some of the most important projection operators.
