Digital meters are generally more accurate and can be equipped with more scales and broader
ranges than analog meters. On the other hand, analog meters are generally less expensive and give
an entire range or scale of reading, which often could be very informative. A digital oscilloscope
represents the combination of analog and digital technologies. By digital sampling techniques,
the oscilloscope trace is digitized and stored in the digital memory included with the digital
oscilloscope. Digital oscilloscopes are generally more costly than analog ones, but their capability
in the analysis and processing of signals is vastly superior.
