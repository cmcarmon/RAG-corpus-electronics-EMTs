In the procedural paradigm a large system is composed of modules which encapsulate procedures which in
turn  implement  algorithms.  Hierarchical  decomposition  of  a  large  problem  into  a  collection  of  subordinate
problems  results  in  a  hierarchical  program  structure.  Hence,  a  large  FORTRAN  or  C  program  is  typically
composed of a collection of procedures (subroutines in FORTRAN and functions in C) organized in layers,
forming a tree structure, much like the organization chart of a large corporation (see Fig. 87.11).
