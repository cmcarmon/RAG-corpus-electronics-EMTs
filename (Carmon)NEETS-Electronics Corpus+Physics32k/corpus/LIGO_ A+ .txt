Like Enhanced LIGO, certain improvements can be retrofitted to the existing Advanced LIGO instrument. These are referred to as "A+" proposals, and are planned for installation over the decade from 2017 to 2026. Two changes would almost double Advanced LIGO's sensitivity and range:
Using frequency-dependent squeezed light, which would simultaneously decrease radiation pressure at low frequencies and shot noise at high frequencies, and
Improved mirror coatings with lower mechanical loss.
Because the final LIGO output photodetector is sensitive to phase, and not amplitude, it is possible to squeeze the signal so there is less phase noise and more amplitude noise, without violating the quantum mechanical limit on their product . This is done by injecting a "squeezed vacuum state" into the dark port (interferometer output) which is quieter, in the relevant parameter, than simple darkness. This has been demonstrated at LIGO and is in use operationally at the GEO600 detector. One change required for Advanced LIGO is frequency dependence. The squeezing must be greater at high frequencies (around 1 kHz), but less at lower frequencies.
