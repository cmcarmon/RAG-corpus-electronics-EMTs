The input signal is coupled through T1. When capacitor C3 is tuned to the proper frequency, the
signal is passed to the emitter of Q1. When no input signal is present, bias is determined by resistor R1.
When the input signal becomes positive, current flows through the emitter-base junction causing it to be
forward biased. C1 and R1 establish the dc operating point by acting as a filter network. This action
provides a varying dc voltage that follows the peaks of the rf modulated envelope. This action is identical
to the diode detector with the emitter-base junction doing the detecting. The varying dc voltage on the
emitter changes the bias on Q1 and causes collector current to vary in accordance with the detected
voltage. Transformer T2 couples these af current changes to the output. Thus, Q1 detects the AM wave
and then provides amplification for the detected waveform.
