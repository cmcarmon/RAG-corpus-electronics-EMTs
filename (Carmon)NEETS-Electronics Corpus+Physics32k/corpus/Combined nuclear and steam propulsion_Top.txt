Combined nuclear and steam propulsion system (CONAS) is used on the Kirov-class guided missile cruisers.
Complementary to the nuclear component there are two conventional boilers, installed as a backup in case of reactor failure. Both components are capable of driving two geared steam turbines, generating 120,000 hp (89 MW) at two prop shafts.
