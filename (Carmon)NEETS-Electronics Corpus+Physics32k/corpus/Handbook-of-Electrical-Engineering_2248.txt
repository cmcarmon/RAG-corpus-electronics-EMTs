In indirect-band materials [e.g., Si, see Fig. 22.3(a)], a band-to-band transition requires a change of momen-
tum that cannot be accomplished by absorption or emission of a photon. Indirect band-to-band transitions
require the emission or absorption of a phonon and are much less probable than direct transitions.
