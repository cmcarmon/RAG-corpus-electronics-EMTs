FIGURE 9.19 Visualizations Illustrating the FDTD-Calculated Sinusoidal Steady-State Optical Electric Field Distributions in a 5.0-mm
Diameter GaAlAs Microdisk Resonator. The resonator is coupled to straight 0.3-mm wide GaAlAs optical waveguides for single-frequency
excitations propagating to the right in the lower waveguide. Upper left: Off-resonance signal; Upper right: On-resonance signal, Ô¨Årst-order radial
mode; Lower left: Second-order radial-mode resonance; Lower right: Third-order radial mode resonance. Courtesy of Hagness et al. (1997).
