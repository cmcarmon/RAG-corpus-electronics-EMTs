Telemetry, then, really begins with measurement. A physical quantity is converted to a signal for transmission
to another point. The transducer that converts this physical quantity into an electrical signal may be a piezo-
electric  crystal,  a  variable  resistance,  or  perhaps  an  accelerometer.  Telemetered  information  need  be  no  less
accurate  than  that  obtained  directly  under  laboratory  conditions.  For  instance,  in  telemetering  strain
measurements, it is possible to achieve accuracies of a few microinches per inch or greater. The only limitation
is usually the degree of stability in the bond of the strain gauge to the specimen, and not the strain gauge itself.
If great accuracy in temperature measurement is desired, it can be attained by choosing a transducer that
provides  a  large  variation  of  output  signal  over  a  small  range  of  process  property  variation.  The  resolution
which this provides may be translated into true accuracy by careful transducer calibration. Accuracy is reduced,
