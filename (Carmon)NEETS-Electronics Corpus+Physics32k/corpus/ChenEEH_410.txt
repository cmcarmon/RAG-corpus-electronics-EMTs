To be able to sum only voltages, we next convert the currents
in equations 4.32(A) and 4.32(B) into voltages. This step is
accomplished by multiplying all currents by a scaling resistor R
and, simultaneously, by multiplying the admittances by R to
obtain so-called ‘‘transmittances’’ tY ¼ 1=(RY ) or tZ ¼ R=Z
as is shown in equation 4.33:
