. Coherent side lobe canceller: The coherent side lobe
canceller uses a small number of auxiliary elements
to adaptively place nulls in the directions of jammers.
The auxiliary elements have a side lobe structure matched
to that of the main antenna, but the antenna’s main
lobe is much smaller. The response of the main and
auxiliary antennas are subtracted, thus cancelling the
response of the radar antenna’s side lobes but not the
main lobe.
