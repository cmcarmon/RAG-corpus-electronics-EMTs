a) Write expressions for the rise and fall times of INV1 for the circuit configuration
shown in Figure 10.92. Assume that the inverters satisfy the static discipline with
voltage thresholds VIL = VOL = VL and VIH = VOH = VH.
(Hint: The rise time of INV1 is the time vB requires to transition from the lowest
voltage reached by vB (given by the voltage divider action of RL and RON) to VH
for a VS to 0-V step transition at the input vA. Similarly, the fall time of INV1 is the
time vB requires to transition from the highest voltage reached by vB (that is, VS) to
VL for a 0-V to VS step transition at the input vA.)
