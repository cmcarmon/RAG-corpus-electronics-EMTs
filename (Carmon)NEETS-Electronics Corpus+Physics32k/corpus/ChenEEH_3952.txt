It should be noted that studies of statistical signal processing
cannot be effective without proper background in probability
theory and random processes. Many reference books on that
subject, such as Billingsley (1979), Kendall and Stuart (1977),
Papoulis and Pillai (2002), and Stark and Woods (2002), are
available.
