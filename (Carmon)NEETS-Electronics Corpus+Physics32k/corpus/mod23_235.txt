2. Equalization and phase correction circuit. This circuit takes the pre-amplified signal and fixes any
frequency response problems that the reproduce magnetic head may have caused. To better
understand this, look at the voltage versus frequency response graph in figure 5-3. The top of the
graph shows the input signal that comes from the pre-amplifier and the bottom shows the
equalization signal generated by the equalization circuit. In the top part of the graph, note how the
output voltage level varies as the frequency of the signal varies. This isnâ€™t good. A good output
voltage level is one that remains constant as the frequency changes. The equalization signal
corrects this problem. Notice that when the input signal and the equalization signal are combined
they cancel each other out. This allows a nice flat (voltage versus frequency) output signal to go
to the output amplifier circuit.
