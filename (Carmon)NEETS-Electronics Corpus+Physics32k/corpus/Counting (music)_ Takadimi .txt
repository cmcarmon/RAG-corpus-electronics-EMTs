The beat is always called ta. In simple meters, the division and subdivision are always ta-di and ta-ka-di-mi. Any note value can be the beat, depending on the time signature. In compound meters (wherein the beat is generally notated with dotted notes), the division and subdivision are always ta-ki-da and ta-va-ki-di-da-ma.
The note value does not receive a particular name; the noteâ€™s position within the beat gets the name. This system allows children to internalize a steady beat and to naturally discover the subdivisions of beat, similar to the down-ee-up-ee system.
Example
The folk song lyric
"This Old Man, he played one, he played knick-knack on my thumb, with a
knick-knack paddy whack, give my dog a bone, this old man came rolling home"
would be said,
"tadi ta tadi ta tadi tadi tadi tadimi
tadi takadi takadimi ta tadi tadi tadi ta."
