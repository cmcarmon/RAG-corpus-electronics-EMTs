For most free space problems, factors 2 and 3 are weaker
functions of the size of the modeled structure than factor 1.
This is because geometrical features at increasing electrical
distances from each other become decoupled due to radiative
losses by the electromagnetic waves propagating between these
features. Further, it can be shown that replacing second-order
accurate algorithms by high-order versions sufﬁciently reduces
numerical dispersion error to avoid the need for progressive
mesh reﬁnement for object sizes up to the order of 100
wavelengths. Overall, a computational burden of order
(N  nmax) ¼ order (N 4=3) is estimated for very large FDTD
and related models.
