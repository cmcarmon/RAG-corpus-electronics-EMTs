Fault-tolerant conﬁgurations of cleverly oriented redundant gyroscopes and accelerometers (typically four
to six) detect and correct sensor failures. Inertial navigators are used aboard naval ships, in airliners, in most
military ﬁxed-wing aircraft, in space boosters and entry vehicles, in manned spacecraft, in tanks, and on large
mobile artillery pieces.
