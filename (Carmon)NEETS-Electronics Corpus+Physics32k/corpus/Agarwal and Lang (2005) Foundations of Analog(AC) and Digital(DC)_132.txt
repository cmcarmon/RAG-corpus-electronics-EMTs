Resistors come in many forms (see Figure 1.12), ranging from lengths of
nichrome wire used in toasters and electric stoves and planar layers of polysili-
con in highly complex computer chips, to small rods of carbon particles encased
in Bakelite commonly found in electronic equipment. The symbol for resistors
in common usage is shown in Figure 1.13.
