Figure 36-43 shows an over-voltage protection 
circuit called a crowbar. The SCR, placed in parallel 
with the load, is normally cut off (not conducting). If 
the output voltage rises above a predetermined level, 
the SCR turns on and places a short circuit across the 
load. With the short circuit across the load, very little 
current flows through the load. This fully protects 
the load. The short circuit across the load does not 
protect the power supply. The output of the power 
supply is shorted, thereby blowing the fuse of the 
power supply.
