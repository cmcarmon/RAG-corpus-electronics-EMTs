These developments continued through World War II with dedicated aircraft including the concept of the heavily protected cockpit or "bathtub" to permit the pilot to survive counterfire from anti-aircraft batteries.
The Luftwaffe's best strafing plane was the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka. The Ju 87 G variant had two Rheinmetall-Borsig 37mm Flak 18 guns each mounted under the wing.
For the RAF the best ground attack plane was the Hawker Hurricane II. It was armed with four 20 mm (.79 in) wing-mounted cannon.  The Hawker Typhoon was used in the later stages of the war. It had four "60 lb" RP-3 rockets.
For the US, the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt was one of the key ground attack planes. It was armed with eight .50 calibre machine guns. Another aircraft that was important in that role was the North American B-25 Mitchell. It was used for low-altitude strafing runs in the Pacific War.
The Russian Ilyushin IL-2 Sturmovik was one of the key Russian ground attack planes. It had heavy armour around the engine, underside and canopy. It was armed with 20mm to 23mm to 37mm cannon depending on the model.
An RCAF Spitfire of 412 Squadron piloted by Charley Fox strafed the command car of Erwin Rommel on 17 July 1944 near Sainte-Foy-de-Montgommery, affecting his possible participation in the 20 July 1944 Operation Valkyrie coup.
