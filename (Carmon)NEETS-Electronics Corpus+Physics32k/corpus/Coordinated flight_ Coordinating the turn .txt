If the pilot were to use only the rudder to initiate a turn in the air, the airplane would tend to "skid" to the outside of the turn.
If the pilot were to use only the ailerons to initiate a turn in the air, the airplane would tend to "slip" toward the lower wing.
If the pilot were to fail to use the elevator to increase the angle of attack throughout the turn, the airplane would also tend to "slip" toward the lower wing.
However, if the pilot makes appropriate use of the rudder, ailerons and elevator to enter and leave the turn such that sideslip and lateral acceleration are zero the airplane will be in coordinated flight.
