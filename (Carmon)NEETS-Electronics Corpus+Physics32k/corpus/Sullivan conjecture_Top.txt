In mathematics, Sullivan conjecture can refer to any of several results and conjectures prompted by homotopy theory work of Dennis Sullivan. A basic theme and motivation concerns the fixed point set in group actions of a finite group



G


{\displaystyle G}
. The most elementary formulation, however, is in terms of the classifying space



B
G


{\displaystyle BG}
of such a group. Roughly speaking, it is difficult to map such a space



B
G


{\displaystyle BG}
continuously into a finite CW complex



X


{\displaystyle X}
in a non-trivial manner. Such a version of the Sullivan conjecture was first proved by Haynes Miller. Specifically, in 1984, Miller proved that the function space, carrying the compact-open topology, of base point-preserving mappings from



B
G


{\displaystyle BG}
to



X


{\displaystyle X}
is weakly contractible.
This is equivalent to the statement that the map



X


{\displaystyle X}
→



F
(
B
G
,
X
)


{\displaystyle F(BG,X)}
from X to the function space of maps



B
G


{\displaystyle BG}
→



X


{\displaystyle X}
, not necessarily preserving the base point, given by sending a point



x


{\displaystyle x}
of



X


{\displaystyle X}
to the constant map whose image is



x


{\displaystyle x}
is a weak equivalence. The mapping space



F
(
B
G
,
X
)


{\displaystyle F(BG,X)}
is an example of a homotopy fixed point set. Specifically,



F
(
B
G
,
X
)


{\displaystyle F(BG,X)}
is the homotopy fixed point set of the group



G


{\displaystyle G}
acting by the trivial action on



X


{\displaystyle X}
. In general, for a group



G


{\displaystyle G}
acting on a space



X


{\displaystyle X}
, the homotopy fixed points are the fixed points



F
(
E
G
,
X

)

G




{\displaystyle F(EG,X)^{G}}
of the mapping space



F
(
E
G
,
X
)


{\displaystyle F(EG,X)}
of maps from the universal cover



E
G


{\displaystyle EG}
of



B
G


{\displaystyle BG}
to



X


{\displaystyle X}
under the



G


{\displaystyle G}
-action on



F
(
E
G
,
X
)


{\displaystyle F(EG,X)}
given by



g


{\displaystyle g}
in



G


{\displaystyle G}
acts on a map



f


{\displaystyle f}
in



F
(
E
G
,
X
)


{\displaystyle F(EG,X)}
by sending it to



g

{\displaystyle gfg^{-1}}
. The



G


{\displaystyle G}
-equivariant map from



E
G


{\displaystyle EG}
to a single point



∗


{\displaystyle *}
induces a natural map η:




X

G


=
F
(
∗
,
X

)

G




{\displaystyle X^{G}=F(*,X)^{G}}
→



F
(
E
G
,
X

)

G




{\displaystyle F(EG,X)^{G}}
from the fixed points to the homotopy fixed points of



G


{\displaystyle G}
acting on



X


{\displaystyle X}
. Miller's theorem is that η is a weak equivalence for trivial



G


{\displaystyle G}
-actions on finite-dimensional CW complexes. An important ingredient and motivation (see [1]) for his proof is a result of Gunnar Carlsson on the homology of



B
Z

/

2


{\displaystyle BZ/2}
as an unstable module over the Steenrod algebra.
Miller's theorem generalizes to a version of Sullivan's conjecture in which the action on



X


{\displaystyle X}
is allowed to be non-trivial. In, Sullivan conjectured that η is a weak equivalence after a certain p-completion procedure due to A. Bousfield and D. Kan for the group



G
=
Z

/

2


{\displaystyle G=Z/2}
. This conjecture was incorrect as stated, but a correct version was given by Miller, and proven independently by Dwyer-Miller-Neisendorfer, Carlsson, and Jean Lannes, showing that the natural map



(

X

G



)

p




{\displaystyle (X^{G})_{p}}
→



F
(
E
G
,
(
X

)

p



)

G




{\displaystyle F(EG,(X)_{p})^{G}}
is a weak equivalence when the order of



G


{\displaystyle G}
is a power of a prime p, and where



(
X

)

p




{\displaystyle (X)_{p}}
denotes the Bousfield-Kan p-completion of



X


{\displaystyle X}
. Miller's proof involves an unstable Adams spectral sequence, Carlsson's proof uses his affirmative solution of the Segal conjecture and also provides information about the homotopy fixed points

E

,

)

G




{\displaystyle F(EG,X)^{G}}
before completion, and Lannes's proof involves his T-functor.
