“1” will be represented on the output. To achieve AND operation, the device is initially set to its “off ” or logic
y
“0” state (i.e., y low and 
 high) with preset pulse, Presety incident on only one pin diode as shown in Fig. 79.27.
If both input signals have logic levels of “1” (i.e., set = 1, reset = 0), then the S-SEED AND gate is set to its
“on” state. For any other input combination, there is no change of state, resulting in AND operation. After the
signal beams determine the state of the device, the clock beams are then set high to read out the state of the
y
 output signal relative to
AND gate. For NAND operation, the logic level is represented by the power of the 
y
the power of the y output signal. That is, when the power of the signal leaving the 
 output is greater than
the power of the signal leaving the y output, a logic “1” is present on the output. The operation of the OR and
NOR  gates  is  identical  to  the AND  and  NAND  gates,  except  that  preset  pulse  Presety  is  used  instead  of  the
preset  pulse  Preset
.  Thus,  a  single  array  of  devices  can  perform  any  or  all  of  the  four  logic  functions  and
memory functions with the proper optical interconnections and preset pulse routing.
