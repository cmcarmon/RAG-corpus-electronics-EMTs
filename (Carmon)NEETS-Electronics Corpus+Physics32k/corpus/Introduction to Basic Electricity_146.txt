Breadboards	allow	the	creation	of	a	circuit	prototype,	which	is	the	reason	why
these	tools	are	ideal	for	beginners.	Bread-boarding,	therefore,	is	the	process	of
creating	a	circuit	prototype	in	a	board	to	resemble	the	operations	of	a	real	circuit.
Its	history	can	be	traced	to	the	time	that	electrical	enthusiasts	would	use	a	literal
breadboard	(i.e.	the	board	used	for	slicing	bread).
According	to	experts,	it’s	recommended	to	learn	and	understand	bread-boarding
prior	to	making	your	first-ever	circuit.	It’s	advised	to	be	familiar	with	each	of	its
components,	as	well	as	how	it	works.
