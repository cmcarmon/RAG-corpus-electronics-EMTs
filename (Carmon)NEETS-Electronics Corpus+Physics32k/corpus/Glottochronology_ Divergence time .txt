The basic formula of glottochronology in its shortest form is:-




t
=



ln
⁡
(
c
)


−
L





{\displaystyle t={\frac {\ln(c)}{-L}}}

where t = a given period of time from one stage of the language to another, c = proportion of wordlist items retained at the end of that period, and L = rate of replacement for that word list.
One can also therefore formulate that:




t
=
−



ln
⁡
(
c
)


2
ln
⁡
(
r
)





{\displaystyle t=-{\frac {\ln(c)}{2\ln(r)}}}

By testing historically verifiable cases where we have knowledge of t through non-linguistic data (e. g. the approximate distance from Classical Latin to modern Romance languages), Swadesh arrived at the empirical value of approximately 0.14 for L (meaning that the rate of replacement constitutes around 14 words from the 100-wordlist per millennium).
