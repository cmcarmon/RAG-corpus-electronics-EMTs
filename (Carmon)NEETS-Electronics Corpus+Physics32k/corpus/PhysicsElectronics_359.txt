The physical principles of semiconductor devices can be understood by considering quantum
energy levels in the material. I will just give a sketchy view here and deﬁne some terminology.
Valance electrons are the electrons outside the closed shells of an atom. In silicon and
germanium there are four valence electrons, arsenic has ﬁve and gallium three. The large
number of valance electrons favour these elements as semiconductors.
