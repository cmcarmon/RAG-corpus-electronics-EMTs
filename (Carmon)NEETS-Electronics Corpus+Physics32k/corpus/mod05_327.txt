Voltage is induced in the rotor as a result of magnetic induction, and a magnetic field is produced
around the rotor. This field will always be in opposition to the stator field (Lenzâ€™s law applies). The
interaction between the rotor and stator fields will not produce rotation, however. The interaction is
shown by the double-ended arrow in figure 4-10, view A. Because this force is across the rotor and
through the pole pieces, there is no rotary motion, just a push and/or pull along this line.
