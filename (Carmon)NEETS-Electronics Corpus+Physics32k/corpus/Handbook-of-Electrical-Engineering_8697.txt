Macro: A single line of code-like text, deﬁned by the programmer, which the assembler will then recognize
and which will result in an inline insertion of a predeﬁned block of code. In most cases, the assembler
allows both hidden and visible local variables and local labels to be used within a macro. Macros also
appear in some HLLs, such as C (the deﬁne paradigm).
