There is a way, however, to reduce wire resistance error far beyond the method just de-
scribed, and also help mitigate another kind of measurement error due to temperature. An
unfortunate characteristic of strain gauges is that of resistance change with changes in tem-
perature. This is a property common to all conductors, some more than others. Thus, our
quarter-bridge circuit as shown (either with two or with three wires connecting the gauge to
the bridge) works as a thermometer just as well as it does a strain indicator. If all we want
to do is measure strain, this is not good. We can transcend this problem, however, by using
a ”dummy” strain gauge in place of R2, so that both elements of the rheostat arm will change
resistance in the same proportion when temperature changes, thus canceling the effects of
temperature change:
