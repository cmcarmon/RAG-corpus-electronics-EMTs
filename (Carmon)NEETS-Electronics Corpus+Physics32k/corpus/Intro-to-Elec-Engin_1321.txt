While the switch is in touch with the upper contact for a short interval of time D << Ts,
and obtains a sample piece of the input signal x(t) every Ts seconds, the output sampled
waveform xs(t) will look like a train of pulses with their tops carrying the sample values of
x(t), as shown in the waveform in Figure 14.2.5(a). This process can be modeled by using
a switching function s(t), shown in the waveform of Figure 14.2.5(b), and a multiplier in
the form
