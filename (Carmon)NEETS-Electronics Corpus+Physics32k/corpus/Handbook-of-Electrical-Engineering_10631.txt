We can expect to see unique lamp shapes and ingenious reﬂector systems developed to illuminate the
LCD uniformly, without adding signiﬁcantly to the overall depth of the display system. There is also a
lot  of  work  in  the  development  of  electroluminescent  panels  as  an  alternative  to  ﬂuorescent  lamps,
although these devices present color difﬁculties as well as comparatively low efﬁcacies.
