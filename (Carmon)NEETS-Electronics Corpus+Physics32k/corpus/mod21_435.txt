Select the formula that yields a ratio greater than unity. The swr calibration can be recorded on the
meter scale directly, recorded on a chart in terms of the meter deflection, or plotted on a graph against the
meter deflection. The variable capacitor, in turn, can be calibrated for various characteristic impedances.
This is accomplished by applying suitable resistors (RO) across the output terminals and noting the
capacitor settings at the respective balance points. A range of 50 to 300 ohms should prove attainable.
