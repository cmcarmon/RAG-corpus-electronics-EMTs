Polarity inversion and voltage gain of the output waveform are not included in this definition of
distortion. Some circuits are designed to distort the output. The reason and methods for this deliberate
distortion will be covered in a later NEETS module. For the most part, however, we desire that circuits
eliminate or reduce distortion.
