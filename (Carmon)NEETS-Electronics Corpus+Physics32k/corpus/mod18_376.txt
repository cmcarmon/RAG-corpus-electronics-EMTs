superimposed IF ripple, as indicated by the solid line in view B. A negative polarity of the output pulse is
ordinarily preferred, but a positive pulse may be obtained by reversing the connections of the diode. In
view A, inductance L1, in combination with wiring capacitance and C2, forms a low-pass filter. This filter
attenuates the IF components in the eo waveform but results in a minimum loss of video high-frequency
components.
