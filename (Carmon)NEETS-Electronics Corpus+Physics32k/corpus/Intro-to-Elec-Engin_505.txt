In terms of the four possible gates (with an output of 1 only) shown in Figure 6.1.8, the circuit in
Figure E6.1.7(a) can be drawn. Note that the resulting circuit will not be minimal, as is usually
the case with the SOP method. The truth table can be realized with only three gates, using the
circuit shown in Figure E6.1.7(b). The student is encouraged to verify by constructing its truth
table.
