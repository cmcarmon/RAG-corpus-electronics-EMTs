When a radio wave passing through the troposphere meets a turbulence, it makes an abrupt change in 
velocity. This causes a small amount of the energy to be scattered in a forward direction and returned to 
Earth at distances beyond the horizon. This phenomenon is repeated as the radio wave meets other 
turbulences in its path. The total received signal is an accumulation of the energy received from each of 
the turbulences.
