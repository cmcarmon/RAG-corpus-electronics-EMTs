The MC and SA techniques fall at the two extremes of BER estimation. MC simulations require no a priori
information  concerning  the  system  performance  or  architecture  but  may  require  tremendous  amounts  of
computer time to execute. SA techniques require an almost trivial amount of computer time for many cases
but  require  the  analyst  to  have  a  considerable  amount  of  information  concerning  the  system.  There  is  a
continuing search for algorithms that fall in between these extremes. These variance reduction algorithms all
share the property of making a limited number of assumptions concerning system performance and architecture,
then using this information to reduce the variance of the MC estimate. Popular techniques are summarized in
[Jeruchim, 1984] and include importance sampling, large deviation theory, extremal statistics, and tail extrap-
olation.  To  successfully  use  one  of  these  techniques  one  must  ﬁrst  understand  the  basic  concept  behind  the
technique. Then one should carefully determine what assumptions were made concerning the system architec-
ture to determine if the system under study satisﬁes the requirements. This can be a difﬁcult task since it is not
always clear what assumptions are required for a speciﬁed technique to be applicable. Finally, one should always
determine the accuracy of the measurement through some technique similar to conﬁdence interval estimation.
