A great advantage in the state-variable approach to network analysis is that it can easily be extended to time-
varying and nonlinear networks, which are often not readily amenable to the conventional methods of analysis.
In these cases, it is more convenient to choose the capacitor charges and inductor ï¬‚ux as the the state variables
instead of capacitor voltages and inductor currents.
