In particle physics, weak isospin is a quantum number relating to the weak interaction, and parallels the idea of isospin under the strong interaction. Weak isospin is usually given the symbol T or I with the third component written as




T


z





{\displaystyle T_{\mathrm {z} }}
,




T

3




{\displaystyle T_{3}}
,




I


z





{\displaystyle I_{\mathrm {z} }}
or




I

{\displaystyle I_{3}}
. It can be understood as the eigenvalue of a charge operator.
The weak isospin conservation law relates the conservation of




T

3




{\displaystyle T_{3}}
; all weak interactions must preserve




T

{\displaystyle T_{3}}
. It is also conserved by the electromagnetic, strong, and gravitational interactions. However, one of the interactions is with the Higgs field. Since the Higgs field vacuum expectation value is nonzero, particles interact with this field all the time even in vacuum. This changes their weak isospin (and weak hypercharge). Only a specific combination of them,

is more important than T and often the term "weak isospin" refers to the "3rd component of weak isospin".
