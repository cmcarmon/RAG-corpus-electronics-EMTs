One-quarter cycle after electrons have begun to flow, the generator will develop its maximum 
voltage and the current will decrease to 0. At that time the condition shown in view C will exist. No 
current will be flowing, but a maximum number of electrons will be at the left end of the line and a 
minimum number at the right end. The charge distribution view C along the wire will vary as the voltage 
of the generator varies. Therefore, you may draw the following conclusions:
