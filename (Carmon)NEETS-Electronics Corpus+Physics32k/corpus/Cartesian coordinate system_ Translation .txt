Translating a set of points of the plane, preserving the distances and directions between them, is equivalent to adding a fixed pair of numbers (a, b) to the Cartesian coordinates of every point in the set. That is, if the original coordinates of a point are (x, y), after the translation they will be




(

x
′

,

y
′

)
=
(
x
+
a
,
y
+
b
)
.


{\displaystyle (x',y')=(x+a,y+b).}
