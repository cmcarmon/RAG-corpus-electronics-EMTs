and the rigorous method. The former is usually based on
the linearized model in which the scattered ﬁeld is approxi-
mated as a linear function of the object function. That is, the
theoretical formulation is approximated at the beginning, and
hence, the problem can be simpliﬁed and easily treated. On
the other hand, the rigorous approach deals directly with the
nonlinear problem based on the rigorous formulation. It is
almost impossible to have a closed-form or exact solution,
however, and some numerical techniques, including how to
discretize the problem, are still needed to obtain a recon-
structed result.
