follow a beam of radar energy that is kept continuously pointed at the desired target; (2) homing missiles
detect and home in on radar energy reflected from the target; the reflected energy is provided by a radar
transmitter either in the missile or at the launch point and is detected by a receiver in the missile; (3)
passive homing missiles home in on energy that is radiated by the target. Because target position must be
known at all times, a guidance radar is generally part of, or associated with, a fire-control tracking radar.
In some instances, three radar beams are required to provide complete guidance for a missile. The beam-
riding missile, for example, must be launched into the beam and then must ride the beam to the target.
Initially, a wide beam is radiated by a capture radar to gain (capture) control of the missile. After the
missile enters the capture beam, a narrow beam is radiated by a guidance radar to guide the missile to the
target. During both capture and guidance operations, a tracking radar continues to track the target. Figure
1-29 illustrates the relationships of the three different radar beams.
