Exercise 5.13
(Solution on p. 192.)
Suppose we obtained our discrete-time signal from values of the product s (t) pTs (t), where the
duration of the component pulses in pTs (t) is ∆. How is the discrete-time signal energy related to
the total energy contained in s (t)? Assume the signal is bandlimited and that the sampling rate
was chosen appropriate to the Sampling Theorem’s conditions.
The following table (5.1) summarizes the properties of the discrete-time Fourier transform. Note the
similarities and diﬀerences with the corresponding properties of the Fourier transform of analog signals
(page 117). The notable diﬀerences are the scaling properties that, for analog signals, are expressed as s(at).
For discrete-time signals, the scaling factor a must be an integer and the resulting spectrum must be periodic
with period 1. For example, the spectrum of x(n) = s(n/2), n even, x(n) = 0, n odd, is derived as follows.
