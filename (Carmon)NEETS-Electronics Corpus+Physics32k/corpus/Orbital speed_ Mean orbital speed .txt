For orbits with small eccentricity, the length of the orbit is close to that of a circular one, and the mean orbital speed can be approximated either from observations of the orbital period and the semimajor axis of its orbit, or from knowledge of the masses of the two bodies and the semimajor axis.

{\displaystyle v\approx {\sqrt {\mu  \over a}}}

where v is the orbital velocity, a is the length of the semimajor axis, T is the orbital period, and μ=GM is the standard gravitational parameter. This is an approximation that only holds true when the orbiting body is of considerably lesser mass than the central one, and eccentricity is close to zero.
In case one of the bodies is not of considerably lesser mass then see: Gravitational two-body problem
So, when one of the masses is almost negligible compared to the other mass, as the case for Earth and Sun, one can approximate the orbit velocity

{\displaystyle v_{o}}
as:

{\displaystyle v_{o}\approx {\sqrt {\frac {GM}{r}}}}

or assuming r equal to the body's radius

{\displaystyle v_{o}\approx {\frac {v_{e}}{\sqrt {2}}}}

Where M is the (greater) mass around which this negligible mass or body is orbiting, and ve is the escape velocity.
For an object in an eccentric orbit orbiting a much larger body, the length of the orbit decreases with orbital eccentricity e, and is an ellipse. This can be used to obtain a more accurate estimate of the average orbital speed:

The mean orbital speed decreases with eccentricity.
