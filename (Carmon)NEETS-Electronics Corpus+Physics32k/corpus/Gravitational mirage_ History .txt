Gravitational bending of light was predicted by Einstein's general relativity in 1916, and first observed by astronomers in 1919 during a total solar eclipse. Accurate measurements of stars seen in the dark sky near the eclipsed Sun indicated a displacement in the direction opposite to the Sun, about as much as predicted by Einstein's theory. The effect is due to the gravitational attraction of the photons when they pass near the Sun on their way to Earth. This was a direct confirmation of an entirely new phenomenon and it represented a milestone in physics.
The possibility of gravitational lensing was suggested in 1924 and clarified by Albert Einstein in 1936. In 1937, Swiss astronomer Fritz Zwicky (1898 - 1974), working at the Mount Wilson Observatory in California, realized that galaxies and galaxy clusters far out in space may be sufficiently compact and massive to observably bend the light from even more distant objects through gravitational lensing. His ideas were confirmed in 1979, when the first example of a cosmic mirage was discovered, the Twin Quasar.
