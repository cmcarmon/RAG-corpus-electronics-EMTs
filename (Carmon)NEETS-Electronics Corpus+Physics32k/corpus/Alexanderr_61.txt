A resistor is either ﬁxed or variable. Most resistors are of the ﬁxed
type, meaning their resistance remains constant. The two common types
of  ﬁxed  resistors  (wirewound  and  composition)  are  shown  in  Fig. 2.3.
The  composition  resistors  are  used  when  large  resistance  is  needed.
The circuit symbol in Fig. 2.1(b) is for a ﬁxed resistor. Variable resis-
tors  have  adjustable  resistance.  The  symbol  for  a  variable  resistor  is
shown in Fig. 2.4(a). A common variable resistor is known as a poten-
tiometer or  pot for  short,  with  the  symbol  shown  in  Fig.  2.4(b).  The
pot is a three-terminal element with a sliding contact or wiper. By slid-
ing the wiper, the resistances between the wiper terminal and the ﬁxed
terminals  vary.  Like  ﬁxed  resistors,  variable  resistors  can  be  of  either
wirewound or composition type, as shown in Fig. 2.5. Although resistors
like those in Figs. 2.3 and 2.5 are used in circuit designs, today most
