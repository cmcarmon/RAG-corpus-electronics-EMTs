Refer to Figure 16-8 for examples of using a multimeter to measure two dif-
ferent voltage drops in the resistor‐LED circuit. In the left image, the meter is 
measuring the voltage that powers the entire circuit, so the multimeter reads 
6.4 V. (Note that the fresh batteries I use are supplying more than their nomi-
nal voltages.) In the right image, the meter is measuring the voltage drop 
across the LED, which is 1.7 V.
