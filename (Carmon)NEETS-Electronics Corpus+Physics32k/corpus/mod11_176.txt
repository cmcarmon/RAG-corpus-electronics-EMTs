The strong dc field going from anode to cathode is created by a large, negative dc voltage pulse 
applied to the cathode. This strong dc field causes electrons to accelerate toward the plate after they have 
been emitted from the cathode. Recall that an electron moving against an E field is accelerated by the 
field and takes energy from the field. Also, an electron gives up energy to a field and slows down if it is 
moving in the same direction as the field (positive to negative). Oscillations are sustained in a magnetron 
because as electrons pass through the ac and dc fields, they gain energy from the dc field and give up 
energy to the ac field. The electrons that give up energy to the ac field are called WORKING 
ELECTRONS. However, not all of the electrons give up energy to the ac field. Some electrons take 
energy from the ac field, which is an undesirable action.
