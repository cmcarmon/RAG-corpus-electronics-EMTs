the transient response increases monotonically or oscillates
with increasing amplitude. This represents an unstable system.
For such a system, as soon as the power is turned on, the
output may increase with time. If no saturation takes place in
the system and no mechanical stop is provided, then the
system may eventually be subjected to damage and fail since
the response of a real physical system cannot increase indeﬁ-
nitely. Hence, closed-loop poles in the right half of the s plane
are not permissible in the usual linear control systems. If all
closed-loop poles lie to the left of the jv axis, any transient
response eventually reaches equilibrium. This represents a stable
system. Therefore, for BIBO stability, the roots of the charac-
teristic equation, or the poles of the transfer function H(s),
must all lie in the left half of the s plane. Note that when a
system has roots on the jv axis, it is unstable by this deﬁnition.
