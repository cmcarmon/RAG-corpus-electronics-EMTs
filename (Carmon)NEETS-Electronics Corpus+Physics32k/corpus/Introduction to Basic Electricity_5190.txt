In electronics, the basic goal of soldering is to elec-
trically and mechanically join two circuit components. 
For soldering to be successful and reliable, the solder 
must adhere to the mating surface. The application of 
solder to a base metal requires the surface to be clean 
and free of contamination. If the surface to be soldered 
is contaminated, the solder tends to ball up and not 
adhere. Sources of contamination include greases, oils, 
and dirt. Aging also causes surface contamination by 
the formation of an oxide film.
