Capacitance 
 
The unit of capacitance is the farad (F). A capacitor 
is said to have a capacitance of 1 F if a current of  
1 A flows in it when a voltage changing at the rate 
of  1  V/s  is  applied  to  it. The  current  flowing  in  a 
capacitor will thus be proportional to the product of 
the  capacitance,  C, and  the  rate  of  change  of 
applied voltage. Hence: 
 
i = C × (rate of change of voltage) 
 
Note  that  we’ve  used  a  small  i to  represent  the 
current  flowing  in  the  capacitor.  We’ve  done  this 
because the current is changing and doesn’t remain 
constant.  
  The 
is  often 
represented  by  the  expression  dv/dt  where  dv 
represents  a  very  small  change  in  voltage  and  dt
