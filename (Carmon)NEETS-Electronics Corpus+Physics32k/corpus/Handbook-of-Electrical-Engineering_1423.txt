where s(n) is the value of the nth sample within the segment of length N. Since the autocorrelation function
of a periodic function is itself periodic, voicing can be estimated from the degree of periodicity of the auto-
correlation function. Figure 15.8 is a graph of the nonnegative terms of the autocorrelation function for a 64-ms
frame of the waveform of Fig. 15.7. Except for the decrease in amplitude with increasing lag, which results from
the rectangular window function which delimits the segment, the autocorrelation function is seen to be quite
periodic for this voiced utterance.
