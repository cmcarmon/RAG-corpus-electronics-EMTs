During the first outbreak of publicity about computers (especially when the UNIVAC predicted the 
outcome of the 1952 presidential election), the term "giant brain" caused much confusion and uneasiness. 
Many people assumed that science had created a thinking device superior to the human mind. Currently 
most people know better. By human standards the giant brain is nothing more than a talented idiot that is 
wholly dependent upon human instructions to perform even the simplest job. A computer is only a 
machine and definitely cannot think for itself. The field of artificial intelligence, however, is developing 
computer systems that can "think"; that is, mimic human thought in a specific area and improve 
performance with experience and operation. The field of digital computers is still in the growing stages. 
New types of circuitry and new ways of accomplishing things are continuing to be developed at a rapid 
rate.
