The force acting on a current-carrying conduc-
tor in a magnetic field depends on the strength of 
the magnetic field, the length of the conductor, and 
the amount of current flowing in the conductor. If 
a loop of wire, free to rotate horizontally, is placed 
between the two poles of a magnet, the loop spins 
as the poles repel each other. The current flows 
in one direction on one side of the loop and in the 
other direction on the other side of the loop. One 
side of the loop moves down and the other side of 
the loop moves upward. The loop rotates in a coun-
terclockwise  direction around its axis. A commuta-
tor  reverses the direction of current flow in the loop 
 every time it reaches the top or zero torque position. 
This is how a DC  motor rotates. The loop or arma-
ture  rotates in a magnetic field. Permanent magnets
