have 40% efﬁciency. This efﬁciency makes thermal manage-
ment and packaging very difﬁcult.
For future microprocessor applications, the power device
must have a smaller FOM value [ < 100(mV  nC)] and a
lower miller charge. With improved device technologies,
such as the SOI LDDMOS technology (Huang, 1998), future
VRM efﬁciency will be higher than 90% at several megahertz
operating frequencies. Figure 1.38 shows the difference be-
tween a vertical DMOS and the proposed LDD MOSFET on
