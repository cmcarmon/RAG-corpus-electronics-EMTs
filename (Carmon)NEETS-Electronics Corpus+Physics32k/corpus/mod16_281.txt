One of the outstanding advantages of transistors is their reliability. Tube failures account for over 90
percent of the failures in electron-tube equipments. Transistors, however, are long lived. This factor,
among others, decreases maintenance required to keep transistorized equipment operating. The techniques
used in testing transistorized equipment are similar to those for maintaining electron-tube circuits.
Basically, these techniques include several checks and inspections.
