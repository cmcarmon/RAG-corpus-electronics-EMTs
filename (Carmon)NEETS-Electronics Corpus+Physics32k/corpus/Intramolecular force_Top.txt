An intramolecular force is any force that holds together the atoms making up a molecule or compound. This includes all types of chemical bonds. They are usually stronger than intermolecular forces, which are present between atoms or molecules that are not bonded. Hydrogen bonds are an important example of a force that can be either intramolecular or intermolecular.
