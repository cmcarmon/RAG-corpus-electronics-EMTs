To access values within the character array, the normal C paradigm is to step a pointer along the array. Source
points at the current character in the array; *source is the character (“what source points at”). source is initialized
at the top of the program before the loop (source = block;) and incremented (source++;) at the bottom of the
loop.  Note  the  many  repetitions  of  *source.  Each  one  means  the  same  current  character.  If  you  read  that
expression  as  the  character  which  source  is  pointing  to,  it  looks  like  an  invitation  to  fetch  the  same  character
from memory eight times. A compiler that optimizes by removing common subexpressions should eliminate all
but the ﬁrst such fetch. This optimization is one of the things that we want to look for.
