COUNTER EMFÂ—The voltage generated within a coil by a moving magnetic field cutting across the coil 
itself. This voltage is in opposition (counter) to the moving field that created it. Counter emf is present 
in every motor, generator, transformer, or other inductance winding whenever an alternating current 
flows [2] [5].
