Until a reform on 28 March 2010, Samara time was UTC+4 in winter and Samara Summer Time (SAMST) was UTC+5 in summer. From that date, Samara time was abolished with the two regions effectively joining Moscow Summer Time. In March 2011, Moscow time was moved forward to UTC+4 year-round, and Samara time was reinstated on 26 October 2014, when Moscow time moved back one hour to UTC+3 year-round and Samara Oblast and Udmurtia remained on UTC+4. On 27 March 2016, Ulyanovsk Oblast and Astrakhan Oblast switched to Samara time by moving the clock 1 hour forwards from Moscow time. On 4 December 2016, Saratov Oblast also switched to Samara time by moving forward 1 hour from Moscow time.
