Building	your	first	circuit	can	be	a	challenge;	since	you’re	still	a	beginner,	you
may	end	up	making	mistakes.	Maybe	your	circuit	won’t	end	up	as	functional	as
desired,	despite	having	followed	your	understanding	of	a	series	of	procedures.	In
such	a	case,	this	is	where	you	have	to	tweak	your	work;	be	diligent	in	figuring	out
where	you	went	wrong.	If	you’re	uncertain	of	your	actions’	impact,	don’t	worry
too	much.	The	important	part	is	to	begin;	you	can,	then,	figure	out	the	rest	along
the	way.
