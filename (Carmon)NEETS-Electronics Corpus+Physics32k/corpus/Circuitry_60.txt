Example 1.26 
 
A coil of 800 turns is wound on a closed mild steel 
core  having  a  length  600  mm  and  cross-sectional 
area  500  mm2. Determine  the  current  required  to 
establish a flux of 0.8 mWb in the core. 
 
Solution 
 
Now B = 9 /A = (0.8 × 10(cid:1)3) / (500 × 10(cid:1)6) = 1.6 T 
 
From Fig. 1.17, a flux density of 1.6 T will occur in
