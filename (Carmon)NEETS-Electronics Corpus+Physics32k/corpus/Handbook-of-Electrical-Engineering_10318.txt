The  transmit  chain  consists  of  several  major  components:  baseband  equipment,  modulators,  frequency
upconverters, high-power ampliﬁers (HPA), and combiner circuitry used to switch the output of the HPAs to
the antenna. The receive chain uses a low-noise ampliﬁer to receive the satellite signals, frequency downcon-
verters, demodulator, and baseband equipment.
