operating at a wavelength of 1550 nm. Equation (71.9) shows that M = 18 ps/(nm · km) at 1550 nm. The light
source was assumed to have a spectral width of 0.2 nm. Then, the pulse dispersion calculated from Eq. (71.10)
yields a pulse spread of 0.36 ns. Because the ﬁber’s rise time is close to its pulse spread, this value is placed in
the table.
