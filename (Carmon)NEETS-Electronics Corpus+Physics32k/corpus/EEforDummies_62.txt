You may hear the term coulomb (pronounced “cool‐ome”) used to describe 
the magnitude of the charge carried by 6,241,000,000,000,000,000 electrons. 
A coulomb is related to an amp in that one coulomb is the amount of charge 
carried by one amp of current in one second. Coulombs are nice to know 
about, but amps are what you really need to understand because moving 
charge, or current, is at the heart of electronics.
