7.4
Before going on with the second half of this chapter, we need to digress
and  consider  some  mathematical  concepts  that  will  aid  our  under-
standing  of  transient  analysis.  A basic  understanding  of  singularity
functions will help us make sense of the response of ﬁrst-order circuits
to a sudden application of an independent dc voltage or current source.
Singularity functions (also called switching functions) are very use-
ful  in  circuit  analysis.  They  serve  as  good  approximations  to  the
switching signals that arise in circuits with switching operations. They
are  helpful  in  the  neat,  compact  description  of  some  circuit  phenom-
ena, especially the step response of RC or RL circuits to be discussed
in the next sections. By deﬁnition,
