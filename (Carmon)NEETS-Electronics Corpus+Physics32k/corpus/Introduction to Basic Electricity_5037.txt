Wrap the artwork around a piece of copper-clad 
board that has been properly cut to size. Clean the board 
with steel wool or with powder cleanser and  water before 
wrapping the artwork around the board. The copper 
side of the board should be toward the artwork, with the 
side identified as bottom facing outward.
