algorithm, we have more accesses to the main memory than to
the local memory. In contrast, for the globally optimized case,
we access the main memory only a bit more than once per
location. The rest of the accesses are to the local memory. This
is due to the increased data locality that is brought about by the
loop transformations and reduced working set sizes from data
layout reorganization. Figure 2.29(C) gives the total power
consumption in the memories for the different local memory
sizes and optimization levels. We observe two issues here Ô¨Årst,
the globally optimized algorithm always performs better, and
second the lowest power consumption for the globally opti-
mized case is for a local memory size of 128 words and not for
any higher size. This is because as we increase the local memory
size, the number of memory accesses to this local memory does
not increase proportionately and the number of accesses to the
main memory remains the same. Hence, the total power con-
sumption increases due to the increase in size of the local
memory. Pure performance optimization does not lead to the
best power solution.
