The discharge causes a corresponding voltage drop across the resistor as shown in graph (C). At time t0,
the current through the resistor is maximum and the voltage drop (er) across the resistor is maximum. As the
current through the resistor decreases, the voltage drop across the resistor decreases until at t1 it has reached
a value of zero. Graph (D) shows the voltage across the capacitor (ec) during the discharge cycle. At time t0
the voltage is maximum and as time progresses toward time t1, the energy stored in the capacitor is depleted.
At the same time the voltage across the resistor is decreasing, the voltage (e) across the capacitor is
decreasing until at time t1  the voltage (ec) reaches zero.
