DESDynI (pronounced destiny) is a dedicated US InSAR and LIDAR mission for studying hazards and global environmental change. The objectives of DESDynI are to:
Determine the likelihood of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and landslides
Predict the response of ice sheets to climate change and impact on sea level
Characterize the effects of changing climate and land use on species habitats and carbon budget
Monitor the migration of fluids associated with hydrocarbon production and groundwater resources
