	
An	important	and	indispensible	tool	in	circuitry	is	a	multimeter.
Imagine	a	situation	when	a	circuit	project	was	presented	to	you.	Since	you	were	requested
to	detail	accurate	measurements	for	its	electric	current,	voltage,	and	resistance,	you	go	to
the	nearest	equipment	laboratory	to	borrow	a	stack	of	devices	for	assistance.
Now,	imagine	the	same	situation,	but	this	time,	you	have	this	tool;	instead	of	having	to	go
to	the	equipment	laboratory	to	borrow	a	stack	of	devices	to	measure	the	electric	current,
voltage,	and	resistance,	you	turn	to	that	tool.	This	particular	time,	you	have	a	multimeter.
If	you’re	not	familiar	with	the	operations	of	a	multimeter,	let	it	be	your	first	job	prior	to
creating	a	circuit	project.	It’s	actually	quite	easy	to	use.	So	long	as	you	are	attentive	to
instructions,	and	you	know	its	components,	certain	restriction,	and	the	technique	to
maximizing	its	functions,	you’re	set.
