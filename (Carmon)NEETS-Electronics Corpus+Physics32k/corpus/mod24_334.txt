abrasion resistance, and stable performance over temperature.
A30. Optical fiber cable component (OFCC), stranded, and ribbon cables designs.
A31. OFCCs are tight-buffer fiber surrounded by arimid yarn and a low-halogen outer jacket.
A32. To minimize microbending of the fibers.
A33. To minimize fiber stress when the cable is bent.
A34. OFCC (12 fibers), stranded (48 fibers), ribbon (204 fibers).
A35. Ribbon.
