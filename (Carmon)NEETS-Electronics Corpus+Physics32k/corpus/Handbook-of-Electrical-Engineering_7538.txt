used to interface the circuits together if these voltage requirements are not met. Of course, a driving circuit’s
output must not exceed the maximum and minimum allowable input voltages for the driven circuit. Also, the
current  sinking  and  sourcing  ability  of  the  driver  circuit’s  output  must  be  greater  than  the  total  current
requirements for the loading circuit. Buffer gates or stages must be used if current requirements are not satisﬁed.
All chips within a single logic family are designed to be compatible with other chips in the same family. Mixing
chips from multiple subfamilies together within a single digital circuit can have adverse effects on the overall
circuit’s switching speed and noise immunity.
