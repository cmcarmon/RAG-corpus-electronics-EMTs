We will begin with a simple representation, and then successively improve
it until we have a representation that can serve as the basis for a static discipline.
One of the representations we saw earlier divided a voltage range into two
intervals and associated a logic value with each, namely,
Logic 0 : 0.0 V ≤ V < 2.5 V.
Logic 1 : 2.5 V ≤ V ≤ 5.0 V.
