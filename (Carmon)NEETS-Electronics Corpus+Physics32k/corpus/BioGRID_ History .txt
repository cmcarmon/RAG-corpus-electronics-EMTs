The BioGRID was originally published and released as simply the General Repository for Interaction Datasets but was later renamed to the BioGRID in order to more concisely describe the project, and help distinguish it from several GRID Computing projects with a similar name. Originally separated into organism specific databases, the newest version now provides a unified front end allowing for searches across several organisms simultaneously. The BioGRID was developed initially as a project at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute at Mount Sinai Hospital but has since expanded to include teams at the Institut de Recherche en Immunologie et en Cancérologie at the Université de Montréal, the Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics at Princeton University, and the Wellcome Trust Center for Cell Biology at the University of Edinburgh. The BioGRID's original focus was on curation of binary protein-protein and genetic interactions, but has expanded over several updates to incorporate curated post-translational modification data, chemical interaction data, and complex multi-gene/protein interactions. Moreover, on a monthly basis, the BioGRID continues to expand curated data and also develop and release new tools, data from comprehensive targeted curation projects, and perform targeted scientific analysis.
