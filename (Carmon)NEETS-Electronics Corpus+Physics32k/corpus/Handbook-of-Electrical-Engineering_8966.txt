Another approach to light interruption is to use a rotating beam of light, which has the advantage that only
one light source and detector pair is required. This technology is depicted in Fig. 89.16 and consists of a LED
and a light detector placed inside a rotating drum which has a slit that allows light to be transmitted outside
the drum. The light is swept across the surface and strikes the retroreﬂectors that sends it back directly to the
detector. The beam scan is sampled 256 times on each scan, and Fig. 89.16 shows how two angles of interruption
are created, angle B by direct interruption, and angle C by mirror reﬂection interruption. The result is that the
location of the interruption can be calculated by comparing the two angles. Again, there is no obstruction of
the screen but a moving element must be added, and parallax errors may occur.
