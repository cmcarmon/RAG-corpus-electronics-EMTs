When Equation (15.3.23) is satisﬁed, the bandwidth of the channel needed to support sFSK(t) is
about 2ωb rad/s. The transmitted signal in Figure 15.3.19 can be seen to be two unipolar ASK
signals in parallel, one at carrier frequency ω2 and the other at ω1. The receiver then becomes two
coherent ASK receivers in parallel (see Figure 15.3.14).
