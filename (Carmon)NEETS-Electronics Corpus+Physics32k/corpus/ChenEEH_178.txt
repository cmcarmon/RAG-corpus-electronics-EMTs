The Ô¨Årst condition is easy to establish by inspection. The
second condition is a standard requirement for stability. Be-
cause the impedance and the admittance are the inverse of each
other, the same must apply for the zeros. Stability is not
destroyed by multiple poles in the left half plane, as stated in
point 3. Point 4 would call for partial fraction expansion of the
