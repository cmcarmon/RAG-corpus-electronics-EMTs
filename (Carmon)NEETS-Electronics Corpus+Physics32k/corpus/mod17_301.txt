The receiver transfer switchboard permits the operator to transfer the audio output from a receiver to 
a remote control station audio circuit. A representative receiver transfer switchboard is shown in figure 3-
4. This switchboard contains ten seven-position switches. Each switch is connected to a remote control 
station, and each switch position (one through five) is connected to a receiver.
