As the wiper (the movable connection) of the rheostat is moved toward the right, there is less
resistance in the control circuit. With less resistance, the control-circuit current increases. This causes the
amount of magnetism in the core to increase and the inductance of the coil in the load circuit to decrease
(because the core is common to both coils). With less inductance in the load circuit, load current increases
and the lamp gets brighter.
