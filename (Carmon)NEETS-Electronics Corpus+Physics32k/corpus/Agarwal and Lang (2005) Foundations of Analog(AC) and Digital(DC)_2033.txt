The phase of H( jω) is also relatively easy to sketch. At the 0.707 frequency,
the real and imaginary parts of the denominator in Equation 14.29 are equal (see
Equation 14.42), so the phase must be +45
◦
above.
These two constraints, along with the low- and high-frequency asymptotes at
+90
◦
respectively, and the phase at resonance of zero, form five
constraints that allow us to draw a fairly accurate phase plot as also shown in
Figure 14.12.
that Q = R/ωoL. Thus,
