The (second) shell just processes them in order, the same as it
would with commands typed on the keyboard. Files containing
shell commands are called shell scripts. Shell scripts may assign
values to shell variables and then read them later. They may also
have parameters and use if, for, while and case constructs. Thus
a shell script is really a program written in a shell language.
