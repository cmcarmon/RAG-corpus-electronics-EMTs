Progress in the signal processing ﬁeld has in recent years been
largely driven by speciﬁc applications. Signal processing often
ﬁgures in multidisciplinary research efforts. A noteworthy suc-
cess in the application of signal processing has been in the ﬁelds
of medicine and healthcare (Baillet et al., 2001; Ebrahimi et al.,
2003). A number of imaging tools have been developed to aid
diagnosis and recognition of disease. Computer tomography
(CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emis-
sion tomography (PET) are being widely used. These imaging
technologies are testimony to the success of multidisciplinary
interaction among researchers in ﬁelds such as signal process-
ing, medicine, biology, and physics. The multidisciplinary effort
can be witnessed in the collaboration on new challenges in
modeling and processing in the emerging modalities for
medical
imaging such as electro/magneto-encephalography
(E/MEG) and electrical impedance tomography (EIT).
