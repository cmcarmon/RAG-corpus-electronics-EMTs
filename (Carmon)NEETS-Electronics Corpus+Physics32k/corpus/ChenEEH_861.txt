Multiple signal paths between a pair of registers, Rx and Ry,
require a more complicated treatment. As speciÔ¨Åed before, there
can be only one edge between the vertices vx and vy in the circuit
graph. Therefore, a methodology is presented for choosing the
correct permissible range bounds and direction labeling for this
single edge. This methodology is illustrated in Figure 4.5 and is a
two-step process. First, multiple signal paths in the same direc-
tion from the register Rx to the register Ry are replaced by a
single edge in the circuit graph according to the transformation
illustrated in Figure 4.5(A). Next, two-edge cycles between
Rx and Ry are replaced by a single edge in the circuit graph
according to the transformation illustrated in Figure 4.5(B).
