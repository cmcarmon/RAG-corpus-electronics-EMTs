(4) Multipoint control unit (MCU): This is an optional
component that provides point-to-multipoint confer-
encing capability to an H.323-enabled network. The
MCU consists of a mandatory multipoint controller
(MC) and optional multipoint processors (MP). The
MC determines the common capabilities of the ter-
minals by using H.245, but it does not perform the
multiplexing of audio, video, and data. The multi-
plexing of media streams is handled by the MP
under the control of the MC. Figure 7.8, illustrates
an H.323-enabled network with all these different
components.
