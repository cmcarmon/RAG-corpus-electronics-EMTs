An important application of particular note is the detection of gravitational radiation with projects such as LIGO. Here high precision distance measurements must be made of two widely separated masses. However, currently the measurements described by quantum metrology are usually not used as they are very difficult to implement and there are many other sources of noise which prohibit the detection of gravity waves which must be overcome first. Nevertheless, plans may call for the use of quantum metrology in LIGO.
