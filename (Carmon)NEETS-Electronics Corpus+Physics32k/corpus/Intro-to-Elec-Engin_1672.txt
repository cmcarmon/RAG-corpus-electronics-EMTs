A voltage ampliﬁer without feedback has a nominal gain of 500. The gain, however, varies in
the range of 475 to 525 due to parameter variations. In order to reduce the per-unit change to
0.02, while maintaining the original gain of 500, if the feedback is introduced, ﬁnd the new direct
transfer gain G and the feedback factor H.
