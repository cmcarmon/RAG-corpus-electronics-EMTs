There are four classes of severity levels. Class 1 is for low-level electromagnetic radiation environments, such
as those typical of local radio/television stations located more than 1 km away and levels typical of low-power
transceivers. Class 2 is for moderate electromagnetic radiation environments, such as portable transceivers that
are  close  to  the  EUT  but  not  closer  than  1  m.  Class  3  is  for  severe  electromagnetic  radiation  environments,
such  as  levels  typical  of  high-power  transceivers  in  close  proximity  to  the  EUT.  Class  4  is  an  open  class  for
situations involving very severe electromagnetic radiation environments. The manufacturer sets the level relative
to the environmental conditions into which the EUT would be installed.
