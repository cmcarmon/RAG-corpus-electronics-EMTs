The Lorentz force imparts a momentum to the particle, so by Newton's second law the particle must impart a momentum to the electromagnetic fields.
In a vacuum, the momentum per unit volume is

B


,


{\displaystyle \mathbf {g} ={\frac {1}{\mu _{0}c^{2}}}\mathbf {E} \times \mathbf {B} \,,}

where μ0 is the vacuum permeability and c is the speed of light. The momentum density is proportional to the Poynting vector S which gives the directional rate of energy transfer per unit area:

.


{\displaystyle \mathbf {g} ={\frac {\mathbf {S} }{c^{2}}}\,.}

If momentum is to be conserved over the volume V over a region Q, changes in the momentum of matter through the Lorentz force must be balanced by changes in the momentum of the electromagnetic field and outflow of momentum. If Pmech is the momentum of all the particles in Q, and the particles are treated as a continuum, then Newton's second law gives

The term on the right is an integral over the surface area Σ of the surface σ representing momentum flow into and out of the volume, and nj is a component of the surface normal of S. The quantity Tij is called the Maxwell stress tensor, defined as
