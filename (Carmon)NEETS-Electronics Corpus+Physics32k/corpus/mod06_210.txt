You may wonder what purpose Ck serves in this circuit. Ck serves as an AC BYPASS. Without Ck,
the bias voltage will vary with ac input signals. This is particularly troublesome in the higher frequencies
like those found in radio receivers. Rk, the cathode-biasing resistor, is used to develop the biasing voltage
on the cathode.
