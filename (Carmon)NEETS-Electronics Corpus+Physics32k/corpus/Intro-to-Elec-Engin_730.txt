Common-Emitter (CE) Conﬁguration
The emitter part of a circuit being common to both the input and the output portions, Figure
8.3.1(a) illustrates a common-emitter (CE) BJT ampliﬁer. The resistors R1, R2, RC, and RE are
primarily set by biasing. The input ac source is represented by its Thévenin equivalent. The
ampliﬁed output ac voltage vL appears across the load resistor RL, which could represent the
input resistance of the next stage in a cascade. Capacitors CB, CC, and CE are so chosen that they
represent short circuits at the lowest frequency of interest. CE would be made large enough so
that 1/ωCE is small relative to RE in parallel with the impedance looking into the emitter at the
smallest ω of interest. Similarly, the reactances of CC and CB would be chosen small relative to
the resistances in their parts of the circuit. Capacitors CB and CC appear as short circuits to the ac
signals, but block the dc voltages and currents out of one part of the circuit from coupling with
