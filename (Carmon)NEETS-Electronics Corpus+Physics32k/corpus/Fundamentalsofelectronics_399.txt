We can create an encoding scheme in the frequency domain (p. 111) to represent an alphabet of letters. But,
as this information-encoding scheme stands, we can represent one letter for all time. However, we note that
the Fourier coeﬃcients depend only on the signal’s characteristics over a single period. We could change
the signal’s spectrum every T as each letter is typed. In this way, we turn spectral coeﬃcients on and oﬀ as
letters are typed, thereby encoding the entire typed document. For the receiver in the Fundamental Model
of Communication (Figure 1.3) to retrieve the typed letter, it would simply use the Fourier formula for the
Fourier spectrum12 for each T -second interval to determine what each typed letter was. Figure 4.9 shows
such a signal in the time-domain.
