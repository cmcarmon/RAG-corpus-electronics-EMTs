Lever-delayed blowback utilizes leverage to delay the opening of the breech. When the cartridge pushes against the bolt face, the lever moves the bolt carrier rearward at an accelerated rate relative to the light bolt. Leverage can be applied with a dedicated part or through inclined surfaces interacting with each other. This leverage significantly increases resistance and slows the movement of the lightweight bolt. John Pedersen patented the first known design for a lever-delay system. The mechanism was adapted by Hungarian arms designer Pál Király in the 1930s and used in the Danuvia 43M. Other weapons to use this system are the Hogue Avenger and Benelli B76 pistols, the Cristóbal Carbine, the TKB-517 and FAMAS assault rifles, the AVB-7.62 battle rifle, the FNAB-43 submachine gun, and the Sterling 7.62 and AA-52 machine guns.
