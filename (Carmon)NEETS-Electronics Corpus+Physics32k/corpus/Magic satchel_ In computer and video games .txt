Since the earliest Infocom text adventures such as Zork and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, many video games have made extensive use of magic satchels or similar devices to hold the player's inventory. Items can be stored in containers, clothing, with companions, or nowhere in particular. Some games allow unlimited storage, others allow a limited inventory that may require players to discard certain items in order to make room for others. Occasionally the unlimited inventory is used as the basis for a joke, for example when a particularly large or awkward item is placed in it.
The point and click Broken Sword series has coined the phrase "George Stobbart pockets" due to the main characters bottomless pockets.
A large number of First-person shooter games allow the player to carry an enormous amount of weaponry with no negative effects (such as reduced speed); often without explanation, though Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force contained mention of a "transporter buffer" for example. RPGs are especially known to have players carrying around outrageous numbers of items and/or extremely large items, such as a house, bicycle, or even other party members (e.g. Final Fantasy, Paper Mario, The Legend of Zelda). On occasion, the gameplay is changed so that players can become encumbered, being able to only carry a set amount of weight and possibly move slower as more items are carried. If a limit, which may depend on certain attributes, is reached, they can no longer carry any more and may be unable to move (e.g. Elder Scrolls, Demon's Souls).
