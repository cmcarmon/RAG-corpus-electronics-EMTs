points where the current divides, called JUNCTIONS, parallel branches begin. These junctions are key
points of reference in any circuit and should be labeled as you find them. The wires in circuit schematics
are assumed to have NO RESISTANCE and there is NO VOLTAGE drop along any wire. This means
that any unbroken wire is at the same voltage all along its length, until it is interrupted by a resistor,
battery, or some other circuit component. In redrawing a circuit, a wire can be "stretched" or "shrunk" as
much as you like without changing any electrical characteristic of the circuit.
