There are a number of types of aberration, caused by the differing components of the Earth's and observed object's motion:
Annual aberration is due to the orbital revolution of the Earth around the Sun.
Planetary aberration is the combination of aberration and light-time correction.
Diurnal aberration is due to the rotation of the Earth about its own axis.
Secular aberration is due to the motion of the Sun and Solar System relative to other stars in our Galaxy.
