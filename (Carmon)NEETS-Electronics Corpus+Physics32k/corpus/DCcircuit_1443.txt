This time the cart is on level ground, already moving. Its energy is kinetic (motion), not
potential (height). Once again if we consider the cart’s braking system to be analogous to
circuit resistance and the cart itself to be the inductor, what resistance value would facilitate
rapid release of that kinetic energy? Maximum resistance (maximum braking action) would
slow it down quickest, of course! With maximum braking action, the cart will quickly grind to a
halt, thus expending its kinetic energy as it slows down. Without any braking action, the cart
will be free to roll on indeﬁnitely (barring any other sources of friction like aerodynamic drag
and rolling resistance), and it will hold its kinetic energy for a long period of time. Likewise,
an inductive circuit will discharge rapidly if its resistance is high and discharge slowly if its
resistance is low.
