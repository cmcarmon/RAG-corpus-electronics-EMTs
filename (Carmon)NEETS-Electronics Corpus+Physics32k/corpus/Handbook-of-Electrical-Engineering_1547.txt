where the Lagrangian multipliers, l
i(p(fi)
– pˆ (fi)).  Ql (ß) is the normalization constant and p(fi)  and  pˆ(fi) are the emperical and expected distributions.
Since the Lagrangian is the log-likelihood for the exponential model, P, the solution states that the model with
the maximum entropy is one that maximizes the likelihood of the training data.
