With this manipulation, we are evaluating the number of computations per sample. For any given value
of the ﬁlter’s order q, the right side, the number of frequency-domain computations, will exceed the left if
the signal’s duration is long enough. However, for ﬁlter durations greater than about 10, as long as the
input is at least 10 samples, the frequency-domain approach is faster so long as the FFT’s power-of-two
constraint is advantageous. Graphically, the parameter range over which the frequency-domain approach
results in fewer computations is shown in the ﬁgure. As the analysis and the plot shows, only for short ﬁlter
durations does the diﬀerence equation approach require fewer computations.
