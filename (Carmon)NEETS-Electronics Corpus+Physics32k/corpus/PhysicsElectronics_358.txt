Along with the diode there is the transistor, which will be discussed in future lectures.
These circuit elements are commonly made from a semiconductor basic material. Semicon-
ductors along with the passive circuit elements are often integrated onto a single electronics
chip. If a hundred or so transistors are on a chip it is referred to as an integrated circuit or
IC. Large-scale integrated circuits, LSI, contain thousands of transistors. And today even
very-large-scale integrated circuits, VLSI, exist, with hundreds of thousands of transistors.
