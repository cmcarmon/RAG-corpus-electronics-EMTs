The use of the digital computer to control physical processes has been a topic of discussion in the technical
literature for over four decades, but the actual use of a digital computer for control of industrial processes was
reserved only for massive and slowly varying processes such that the high cost and slow computing speed of
available computers could be tolerated. The invention of the integrated circuit microprocessor in the early 1970s
radically  changed  all  that;  now  microprocessors  are  used  in  control  tasks  in  automobiles  and  household
appliances, applications where high cost is not justiÔ¨Åable.
