A key concept in the dynamics of vortices is the vorticity, a vector that describes the local rotary motion at a point in the fluid, as would be perceived by an observer that moves along with it. Conceptually, the vorticity could be observed by placing a tiny rough ball at the point in question, free to move with the fluid, and observing how it rotates about its center. The direction of the vorticity vector is defined to be the direction of the axis of rotation of this imaginary ball (according to the right-hand rule) while its length is twice the ball's angular velocity. Mathematically, the vorticity is defined as the curl (or rotational) of the velocity field of the fluid, usually denoted by






ω
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {\omega }}}
and expressed by the vector analysis formula



∇

u

→





{\displaystyle \nabla \times {\vec {\mathit {u}}}}
, where



∇


{\displaystyle \nabla }
is the nabla operator and







u

{\displaystyle {\vec {\mathit {u}}}}
is the local flow velocity.
The local rotation measured by the vorticity






ω

{\displaystyle {\vec {\omega }}}
must not be confused with the angular velocity vector of that portion of the fluid with respect to the external environment or to any fixed axis. In a vortex, in particular,






ω

{\displaystyle {\vec {\omega }}}
may be opposite to the mean angular velocity vector of the fluid relative to the vortex's axis.
