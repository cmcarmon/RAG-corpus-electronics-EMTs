The effectiveness of the automated tuning system was demonstrated in experiments in which the micro-
wave apparatus was used to heat an alumina rod. The apparatus was operated with a forward microwave
power of 200 W in two cases; one with and one without automatic tuning. Without automatic tuning, the
rod attained an asymptotic temperature of about 600(cid:176)C in 5 min. With automatic tuning, the temperature
of the rod exceeded 900(cid:176)C (and was still increasing) in less than 2 min.
