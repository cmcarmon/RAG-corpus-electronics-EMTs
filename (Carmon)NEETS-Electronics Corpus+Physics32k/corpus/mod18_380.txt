one or more IF amplifier stages. Manual gain control by the operator is the simplest method. Usually,
some more complex form of automatic gain control (agc) or instantaneous automatic gain control (iagc) is
used during normal operation. Gain control is necessary to adjust the receiver sensitivity for the best
reception of signals of widely varying amplitudes. Agc and iagc circuits are designed with, a shut-off
feature so that receiver gain may be adjusted manually. In this way, manual gain control can be used to
adjust for best reception of a particular signal.
