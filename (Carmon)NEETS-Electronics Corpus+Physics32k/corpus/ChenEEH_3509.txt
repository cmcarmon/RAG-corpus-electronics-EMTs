Fundamentals of discrete-time systems and properties such
as
time-invariance, causality, and stability are
reviewed ﬁrst. Frequency domain analysis of signals and Four-
ier transforms are then presented followed by a discussion of
frequency-selective ﬁltering. Basics of z-transforms are covered
next with a discussion of the z-domain interpretation of
system properties such as causality and stability. Operations
of sampling and quantization are then presented. Finally, the
discrete Fourier transform is presented, and its importance in
implementing signal processing algorithms is described. Our
discussion is conﬁned to the description and processing of
deterministic signals.
