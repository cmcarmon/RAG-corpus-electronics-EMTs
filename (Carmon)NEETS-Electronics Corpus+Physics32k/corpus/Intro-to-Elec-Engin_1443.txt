Figure 15.2.9 shows the general conﬁguration. A PLL is utilized to generate a phase-coherent
carrier signal that is mixed with the received signal in a balanced modulator. The output of the
balanced modulator is fed into a low-pass ﬁlter of bandwidth W, which passes the desired signal
and rejects all signal (and noise) components above W Hz.
