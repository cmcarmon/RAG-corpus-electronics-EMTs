does not need to see the audience, such as a speech from a senior corporate executive. In a point-to-multipoint
conference, multiple sites can receive a transmitting site. Two of the primary sites are fully interactive with each
other. A feature called multipoint switching has been implemented in some commercial systems. This feature
allows switching of receive and transmit sites during the conference. The multipoint switching feature can be
provided using either a TDMA or SCPC system. A TDMA system allows multiple sites to transmit and receive
in  a  mesh  conﬁguration. An  economical  multipoint  switching  system  is  possible  with  SCPC  using  only  two
transmit frequencies. In a “chair” controlled conference, the chair is assigned one of these frequencies for the
duration of the conference. Dynamic allocation of the second frequency is controlled by the chair to any of the
participating sites at any time during the conference.
