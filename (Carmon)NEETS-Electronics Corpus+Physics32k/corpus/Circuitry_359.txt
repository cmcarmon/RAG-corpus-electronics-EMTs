(note that this is similar to the expression for hie). 
  The transistor’s input characteristic can be used 
to  predict  the  input  resistance  of  a  transistor 
amplifier  stage.  Since  the  input  characteristic  is 
non-linear  (recall  that  very  little  happens  until  the 
base-emitter  voltage  exceeds  0.6  V),  the  value  of 
input  resistance  will  be  very  much  dependent  on 
the exact point on the graph at which the transistor 
is  being  operated.  Furthermore,  we  might  expect 
quite  different  values  of  resistance  according  to 
whether  we  are  dealing  with  larger  d.c.  values  or 
smaller  incremental  changes  (a.c.  values).  Since 
this  can  be  a  rather  difficult  concept,  it  is  worth 
expanding on it.  
  Figure  7.23  shows  a  typical  input  characteristic 
in  which  the  transistor  is  operated  with  a  base 
current, IB, of 50 µA. This current produces a base-
emitter  voltage,  VBE, of  0.65  V.  The 
input 
resistance  corresponding  to  these  steady  (d.c.) 
values will be given by:
