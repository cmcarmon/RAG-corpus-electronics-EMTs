According to Fermat’s principle, the actual path between two points taken by a beam of light is one that takes the least time. In 1697 Johann Bernoulli used this principle to derive the brachistochrone curve by considering the trajectory of a beam of light in a medium where the speed of light increases following a constant vertical acceleration (that of gravity g).
By the conservation of energy, the instantaneous speed of a body v after falling a height y in a uniform gravitational field is given by:




v
=


2
g
y




{\displaystyle v={\sqrt {2gy}}}
,
The speed of motion of the body along an arbitrary curve does not depend on the horizontal displacement.
Bernoulli noted that the law of refraction gives a constant of the motion for a beam of light in a medium of variable density:

{\displaystyle {\frac {\sin {\theta }}{v}}={\frac {1}{v}}{\frac {dx}{ds}}={\frac {1}{v_{m}}}}
,
where vm is the constant and



θ


{\displaystyle \theta }
represents the angle of the trajectory with respect to the vertical.
The equations above lead to two conclusions:
At the onset, the angle must be zero when the particle speed is zero. Hence, the brachistochrone curve is tangent to the vertical at the origin.
The speed reaches a maximum value when the trajectory becomes horizontal and the angle θ = 90°.
Assuming for simplicity that the particle (or the beam) with coordinates (x,y) departs from the point (0,0) and reaches maximum speed after falling a vertical distance D:

{\displaystyle v_{m}={\sqrt {2gD}}}
