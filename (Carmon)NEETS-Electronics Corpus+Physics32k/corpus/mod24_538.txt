Return loss and reflectance are measured using EIA/TIA-455-107. They are measured using an
optical source connected to one input of a 2 Â· 2 fiber optic coupler. Light is launched into the component
under test through the fiber optic coupler. The light reflected from the component under test is transmitted
back through the fiber optic coupler to a detector connected to the other input port. The optical power is
measured at the output of the device under test (Po) and at the input port of the coupler where the detector
is located (Pr). Po is corrected to account for the loss in power through the device under test. Pr is
corrected to account for the loss in power through the coupler and any other connection losses in the path.
The reflectance is then given by the ratio Pr/Po.
