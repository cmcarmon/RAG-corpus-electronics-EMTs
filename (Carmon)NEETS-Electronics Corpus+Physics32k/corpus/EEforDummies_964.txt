Cheapo soldering irons use only two‐prong plugs and don’t have ground con-
nections. Some soldering irons that have three‐prong plugs still pose an ESD 
threat because their tips aren’t grounded, even if their bodies are. Because 
you can’t find a really safe-and-sure means of attaching a grounding wire to a 
low‐end soldering iron, your best bet is to fork over some money for a new, 
well‐grounded soldering iron. The popular Weller WES51 is ESD safe and rea-
sonably affordable.
