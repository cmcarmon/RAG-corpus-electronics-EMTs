Many types of excitable tissue can be stimulated by eddy current. Geddes et al. [1991] investigated its use
to  produce  inspiration  in  humans  by  stimulating  both  phrenic  nerves  at  the  base  of  the  neck.  The  phrenic
nerves cause the diaphragm to contract, thereby producing inspiration. By using two series-connected pairs of
coplanar coils, each pair angled at 150(cid:176), current pulses at 25/sec were delivered from a 50 mF capacitor charged
