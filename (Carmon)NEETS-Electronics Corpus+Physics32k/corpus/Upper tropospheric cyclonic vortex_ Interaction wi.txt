As upper level lows retrograde over land masses, they can enhance thunderstorm activity during the afternoon. This magnifies regional monsoon regimes, such as that over western North America near the United States and Mexican border, which can be used to effectively forecast monsoon surges in precipitation magnitude. Across the north Indian Ocean, the formation of this type of vortex leads to the onset of monsoon rains during the wet season.
