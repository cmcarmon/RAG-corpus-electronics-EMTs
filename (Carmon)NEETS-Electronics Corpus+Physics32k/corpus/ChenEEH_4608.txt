Figures 8.13 through 8.15 show the online simulation results
under the intelligent FDA framework. The abrupt anticipated
failure mode 3 that occurred at time-step 70 is quickly recog-
nized by the diagnosis process, and the effective control com-
mands are then switched to the corresponding postfailure
control actions. This is clearly seen in the online system status
plot shown in Figure 8.14 and the system online response shown
in Figure 8.13. Observing Figure 8.15 closely, one can also Ô¨Ånd
that the time domain signatures of actual failure dynamics and
the postfailure mode 3 are almost undistinguishable from time-
step 80 to 320. After the second change of the system dynamics
caused by another time-varying incipient failure, the discrep-
ancy between the signatures are getting large, which indicates
that an unanticipated situation has occurred.
