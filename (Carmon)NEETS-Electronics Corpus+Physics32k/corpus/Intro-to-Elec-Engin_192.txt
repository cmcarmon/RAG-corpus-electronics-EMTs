While SPICE is capable of several types of analysis, here we illustrate how to solve resistive
circuits containing dc sources using the DC command. PSpice can sweep the value of the source,
when the starting value, the end value, and the increment between values are given. If the
starting and end values are the same, the solution is carried out for only a single value of the
source.
