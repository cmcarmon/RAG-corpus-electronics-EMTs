One of the most commonly used optimization criteria is the
MSE (i.e., minimizing the error variance). This approach leads
to the class of Wiener ﬁlters that includes the Kalman ﬁlter as
a special case. In essence, the Kalman ﬁlter is a realizable
Wiener ﬁlter as it is derived with a realizable (state-space)
model. Those linear estimators are much more appealing in
practice due to reduced implementational complexity and
relative simplicity of performance analysis.
