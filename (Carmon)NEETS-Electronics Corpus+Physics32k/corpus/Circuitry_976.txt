function repeats itself (i.e. the shape of the graph is 
periodic). In the next section we shall plot the sine 
function but, before we do we shall take a look at 
using radian measure to specify angles. 
  The radian is defined as the angle subtended by 
an arc of a circle equal in length to the radius of the 
circle. This relationship is illustrated in Fig. A8.15.
