Assume the motion of the projectile is being measured from a free fall frame which happens to be at (x,y) = (0,0) at t = 0. The equation of motion of the projectile in this frame (by the principle of equivalence) would be



y
=
x
tan
⁡
(
θ
)


{\displaystyle y=x\tan(\theta )}
. The co-ordinates of this free-fall frame, with respect to our inertial frame would be



y
=

{\displaystyle y=-gt^{2}/2}

{\displaystyle y=-g(x/v_{h})^{2}/2}

Now translating back to the inertial frame the co-ordinates of the projectile becomes

is the angle of elevation, and g is the acceleration due to gravity).
