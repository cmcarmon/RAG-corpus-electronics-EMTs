Topographic Mapping
Computerized  tomography  (CT)  and  magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI)  have  demonstrated  the  impact  of
spatial displays on data interpretation and analysis. Similarly, mapping techniques have been applied to elec-
trophysiologic data to depict the spatial information available from multielectrode recordings. This effort has
been assisted by the development and implementation of low-cost, high-resolution graphic displays on micro-
computer systems. The data are frequently presented as two-dimensional topographic color maps [Zappulla,
1991].  In  the  time  domain,  color  values  depict  the  changes  in  potential  across  the  scalp  at  each  time  point.
This is exempliÔ¨Åed by mapping peaks of an evoked potential or the spatial distribution of an epileptic spike.
Temporal  changes  in  the  spatial  distribution  of  voltage  can  be  presented  graphically  as  a  series  of  maps
constructed at adjacent time points or by cartooning the topographic maps over the time interval of interest.
In the frequency domain, color coding can be used to spatially map power, covariance, and phase values. These
maps may be constructed for the broadband activity or for selective frequency components.
