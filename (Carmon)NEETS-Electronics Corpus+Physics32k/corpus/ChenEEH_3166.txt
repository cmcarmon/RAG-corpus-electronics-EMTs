Flashovers usually cause momentary interruption of power
ﬂow in the circuit. Interruption may cause customer interrup-
tion depending on the system conﬁguration. Such interrup-
tions, although a nuisance, can be tolerated in rural locations.
In urban areas with high-tech industries that use semiconduc-
tors and in pharmaceutical and automotive ﬁelds even tempo-
rary interruptions are not acceptable because they lead to huge
ﬁnancial losses from lost production, jammed machinery, and
loss of process control.
