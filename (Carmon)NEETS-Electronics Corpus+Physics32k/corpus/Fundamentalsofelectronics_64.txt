2.3 Signal Decomposition6
A signal’s complexity is not related to how wiggly it is. Rather, a signal expert looks for ways of decomposing
a given signal into a sum of simpler signals, which we term the signal decomposition. Though we will
never compute a signal’s complexity, it essentially equals the number of terms in its decomposition.
In
writing a signal as a sum of component signals, we can change the component signal’s gain by multiplying
it by a constant and by delaying it. More complicated decompositions could contain derivatives or integrals
of simple signals.
