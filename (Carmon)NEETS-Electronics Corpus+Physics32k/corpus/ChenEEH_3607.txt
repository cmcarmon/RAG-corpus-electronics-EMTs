A good discrete approximation of E(v) can be obtained by
evaluating the weighted error function on a dense frequency
grid with 0  vi  p for i ¼ 1, . . . , L(M þ 1). For practical
purposes, for a ﬁlter of length M þ 1, we use 8  L  16.
Points placed at the transition band are disregarded, whereas
the remaining frequencies should be linearly redistributed in
the passband and stopband including their corresponding
edges. Thus, the following vector equation results:
