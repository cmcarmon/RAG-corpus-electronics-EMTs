Faraday's law is used for measuring the flow of electrically conductive liquids and slurries. Such instruments are called magnetic flow meters. The induced voltage ℇ generated in the magnetic field B due to a conductive liquid moving at velocity v is thus given by:

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}=-B\ell v,}

where ℓ is the distance between electrodes in the magnetic flow meter.
