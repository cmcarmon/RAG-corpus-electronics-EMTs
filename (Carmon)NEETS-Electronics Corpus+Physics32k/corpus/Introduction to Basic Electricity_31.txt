that	a	transformer	significantly	improves	the	electric	flow	in	a	circuit,	and
consequently,	results	to	a	more	powerful	circuit.	The	discovery	made	way	for
various	transformer	designs,	as	well	as	various	transformer	sizes.
A	primary	principle	of	a	transformer	is	its	need	for	extremely	high	magnetic
permeability.	It	follows	that	a	circuit	that	is	capable	of	attracting	power	is,	of
course,	more	inclined	to	have	electric	current	transferred	to	it;	and,	conversely,	a
circuit	with	low	magnetic	permeability	is	less	likely	to	extract	power	from	another
circuit.
