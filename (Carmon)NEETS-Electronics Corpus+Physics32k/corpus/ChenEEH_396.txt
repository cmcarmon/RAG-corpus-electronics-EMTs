where v0 is a frequency that is critical for the application,
such as the center frequency in our band-pass case of Figure
4.7 or the passband corner in a low-pass ﬁlter. The simulated
inductor is then equal to L ¼ C2R2
1. Finally, the design is
completed by choosing R ¼ QR1 to determine the quality
factor.
