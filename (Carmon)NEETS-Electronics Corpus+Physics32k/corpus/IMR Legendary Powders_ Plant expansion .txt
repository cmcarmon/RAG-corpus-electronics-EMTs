DuPont began production of the IMR line of smokeless powders across the river from the Wilmington Plant at Carney's Point, New Jersey in 1892. The first powders were called "MR" for Military Rifle powder. In the 1920s these powders were improved and the name was changed to IMR. Various different powder are produced and are given numbers to distinguish them. The different types of powder typically have different burning rates. Due to the construction of metallic cartridges, different amounts of powder of different burning speeds are used to obtain optimum performance and accuracy.
Due to the increased demand for these powders which resulted from World War I an additional plant was constructed in Valleyfield, Canada which remains the primary source of IMR powders today. During World War II up to 1,000,000 pounds of powder was being shipped per day.
