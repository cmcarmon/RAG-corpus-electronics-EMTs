In signal processing, the Nyquist rate, named after Harry Nyquist, is twice the bandwidth of a bandlimited function or a bandlimited channel. This term means two different things under two different circumstances:
as a lower bound for the sample rate for alias-free signal sampling (not to be confused with the Nyquist frequency, which is half the sampling rate of a discrete-time system) and
as an upper bound for the symbol rate across a bandwidth-limited baseband channel such as a telegraph line or passband channel such as a limited radio frequency band or a frequency division multiplex channel.
