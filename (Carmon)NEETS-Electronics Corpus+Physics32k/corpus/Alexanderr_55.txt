2.1
Chapter  1  introduced  basic  concepts  such  as  current,  voltage,  and
power  in  an  electric  circuit. To  actually  determine  the  values  of  these
variables  in  a  given  circuit  requires  that  we  understand  some  funda-
mental laws that govern electric circuits. These laws, known as Ohm’s
law and Kirchhoff’s laws, form the foundation upon which electric cir-
cuit analysis is built.
