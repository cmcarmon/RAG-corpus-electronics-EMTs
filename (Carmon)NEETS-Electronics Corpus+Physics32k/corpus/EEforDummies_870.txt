Remember, as you work on projects, you crouch over your workbench for 
hours at a time. You can skimp and buy or build an inexpensive worktable, 
but if you don’t already own a good chair, put one on the top of your shop-
ping list. Be sure to adjust the seat for the height of the worktable. A poor‐ 
fitting chair can cause backaches and fatigue.
