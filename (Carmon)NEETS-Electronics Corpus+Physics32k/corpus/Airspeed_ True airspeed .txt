True airspeed



(

V

t


)


{\displaystyle (V_{t})}
is the speed of the aircraft relative to the atmosphere. The true airspeed and heading of an aircraft constitute its velocity relative to the atmosphere. The vector relationship between the true airspeed and the speed with respect to the ground



(

V

)


{\displaystyle (V_{g})}
is:

V

w




{\displaystyle V_{t}\ =\ V_{g}-V_{w}}

where





V

w




{\displaystyle V_{w}}
= Windspeed vector
Aircraft flight instruments, however, don't compute true airspeed as a function of groundspeed and windspeed. They use impact and static pressures as well as a temperature input. True airspeed is equivalent airspeed that is corrected for pressure altitude and temperature (which define density). The result is the true physical speed of the aircraft relative to the surrounding body of air. At standard sea level conditions, true airspeed, calibrated airspeed and equivalent airspeed are all equal.
The simplest way to compute true airspeed is using a function of Mach number:

{\displaystyle V_{t}\ =\ a_{0}\cdot M{\sqrt {\frac {T}{T_{0}}}}}

where

{\displaystyle a_{0}}

M


{\displaystyle M}

T


{\displaystyle T}
= Temperature (kelvin)

{\displaystyle T_{0}}
= Standard sea level temperature (288.15 kelvin)

{\displaystyle V_{t}\ =\ a_{0}\cdot {\sqrt {5\left[\left({\frac {q_{c}}{P}}+1\right)^{\frac {2}{7}}-1\right]\cdot {\frac {T}{T_{0}}}}}}

{\displaystyle a_{0}}

{\displaystyle q_{c}}

T


{\displaystyle T}

T

{\displaystyle T_{0}}

The above equation is only for Mach numbers less than 1.0.
True airspeed differs from the equivalent airspeed because the airspeed indicator is calibrated at SL, ISA conditions, where the air density is 1.225 kg/m³, whereas the air density in flight normally differs from this value.
