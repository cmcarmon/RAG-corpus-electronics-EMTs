Programmers must use a language that can be understood by the computer. Several methods can 
achieve human-computer communication. For example, let us assume the computer only understands 
French and the programmer speaks English. The question arises: How are we to communicate with the 
computer? One approach is for the programmer to code the instructions with the help of a translating 
dictionary before giving them to the processor. This would be fine so far as the computer is concerned; 
however, it would be very awkward for the programmer.
