In plasma physics, the Lundquist number (denoted by



S


{\displaystyle S}
) is a dimensionless ratio which compares the timescale of an Alfvén wave crossing to the timescale of resistive diffusion. It is a special case of the Magnetic Reynolds number when the Alfvén velocity is the typical velocity scale of the system, and is given by




S
=

η


,


{\displaystyle S={\frac {Lv_{A}}{\eta }},}

where



L


{\displaystyle L}
is the typical length scale of the system,



η


{\displaystyle \eta }
is the magnetic diffusivity and




v

A




{\displaystyle v_{A}}
is the Alfvén velocity of the plasma.
High Lundquist numbers indicate highly conducting plasmas, while low Lundquist numbers indicate more resistive plasmas. Laboratory plasma experiments typically have Lundquist numbers between

. Considerations of Lundquist number are especially important in magnetic reconnection.
