of the resulting product. Fast convolution results in signiﬁcant computational saving over performing the time-
domain convolution of returns with the ﬁlter function corresponding to the matched ﬁlter. The signal processor
output can be characterized in terms of range gates and Doppler ﬁlters corresponding approximately to the
range and Doppler resolution, respectively.
