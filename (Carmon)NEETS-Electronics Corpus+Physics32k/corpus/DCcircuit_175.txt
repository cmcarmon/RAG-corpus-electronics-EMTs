However, reality is not always this simple. One of the phenomena explored in a later chap-
ter is that of conductor resistance changing with temperature. In an incandescent lamp (the
kind employing the principle of electric current heating a thin ﬁlament of wire to the point that
it glows white-hot), the resistance of the ﬁlament wire will increase dramatically as it warms
from room temperature to operating temperature. If we were to increase the supply voltage
in a real lamp circuit, the resulting increase in current would cause the ﬁlament to increase
temperature, which would in turn increase its resistance, thus preventing further increases in
current without further increases in battery voltage. Consequently, voltage and current do not
follow the simple equation ”I=E/R” (with R assumed to be equal to 3 Ω) because an incandescent
lamp’s ﬁlament resistance does not remain stable for different currents.
