The beat-frequency oscillator (bfo) is necessary when you want to receive cw signals. Cw signals are
not modulated with an audio component, you remember, so we must provide one. The action of the rf
amplifier, mixer, local oscillator, and IF amplifier is the same for both cw and AM; but the cw signal
reaches the detector as a single frequency signal with no sideband components. To produce an af output,
you must heterodyne (beat) any cw signal with an rf signal of the proper frequency. This separate signal is
obtained from an oscillator known as a beat-frequency oscillator.
