Figure 4.10: A periodic pulse signal, such as shown on the left part (∆/T = 0.2), serves as the input to
an RC lowpass ﬁlter. The input’s period was 1 ms (millisecond). The ﬁlter’s cutoﬀ frequency was set to
the various values indicated in the top row, which display the output signal’s spectrum and the ﬁlter’s
transfer function. The bottom row shows the output signal derived from the Fourier series coeﬃcients
shown in the top row. (a) Periodic pulse signal (b) Top plots show the pulse signal’s spectrum for various
cutoﬀ frequencies. Bottom plots show the ﬁlter’s output signals.
