Methods that use more than one determinant are not strictly post-Hartreeâ€“Fock methods, as they use a single determinant as reference, but they often use similar perturbation, or configuration interaction methods to improve the description of electron correlation. These methods include:
Multi-configurational self-consistent field (MCSCF)
Multireference single and double configuration interaction (MRCISD)
N-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT).
