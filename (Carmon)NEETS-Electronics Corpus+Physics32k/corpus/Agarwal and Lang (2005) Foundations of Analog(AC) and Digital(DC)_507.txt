If the system is linear, then the answer to this question is very simple. We
will show that any collection of voltage sources, current sources, and resistors
can be represented at any one pair of terminals by one voltage source and one
resistor, or by one current source and one resistor. The graphical construction
of Figure 1.43 already hinted at this fact, but we present here a more formal
proof. We start with a general linear network containing sources and resistors,
shown as an amorphous box in Figure 3.55a. We presume that the only two
