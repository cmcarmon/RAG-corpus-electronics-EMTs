Initially both semiconductors are totally neutral. The concentration of positive and
negative carriers are quite diﬀerent on opposite sides of the junction and the thermal energy-
powered diﬀusion of positive carriers into the N-type material and negative carriers into the
P-type material occurs. The N-type material acquires an excess of positive charge near
the junction and the P-type material acquires an excess of negative charge. Eventually
diﬀuse charges build up and an electric ﬁeld is created which drives the minority charges
and eventually equilibrium is reached. A region develops at the junction called the depletion
region. This region is essentially un-doped or just intrinsic silicon.
