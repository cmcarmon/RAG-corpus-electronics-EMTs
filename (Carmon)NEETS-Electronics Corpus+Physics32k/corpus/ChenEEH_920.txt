will be called the circuit connectivity matrix, and each row of
B corresponds to a cycle of the circuit graph and contains
elements from the incidence matrix A combined with zeros
depending on whether a skew (an edge) belongs to the cycle.
Note that since each cycle contains exactly one chord, the
cycles can always be permuted such that the cycles appear in
the order of the chords i.e. C1 corresponds to e1, C2 corres-
ponds to e2, and so on). If this correspondence is applied, the
matrix B can be represented as:
