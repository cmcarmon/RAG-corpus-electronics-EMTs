A Fast VRM with a Small Ripple: The Interleaved
QSW VRM
To meet both the steady state and transient requirements, a
novel VRM topology, the interleaved QSW,
is introduced
in Figure 1.16. The interleaved QSW topology naturally
cancels the output current ripple and still maintains the fast
transient response characteristics of the QSW topology. A
smaller capacitance is needed compared to both the single-
module QSW VRM and the conventional VRM. The more
modules in parallel, the better the ripple canceling effect.
Figure 1.17 shows a four-module interleaved QSW VRM.
Figure 1.18 shows its transient response. The results show
that this technique can meet future transient requirements
without a large steady-state voltage ripple. Compared with
the single-module QSW topology, the efﬁciency is improved
signiﬁcantly. Figure 1.19 shows the efﬁciency comparison
results.
