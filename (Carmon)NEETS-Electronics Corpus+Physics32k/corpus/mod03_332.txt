In the example shown, the code 3AG represents the same information as the underlined portions of
F02 G 1R00 A from figure 2-8 (Old Military Designation) and F02A 250VIAS from figure 2-9 (New
Military Designation). The only way to know the time delay rating of this fuse is to look it up in the
manufacturer’s catalog or in a cross-reference listing to find the military designation. The catalog will tell
you the physical size, the material from which the fuse is constructed, and the time delay rating of the
fuse. A 3AG fuse is a glass-bodied fuse, 1/4 inch ·  1 1/4 inches (6.35 millimeters ·  31.8 millimeters) and
has a standard time delay rating.
