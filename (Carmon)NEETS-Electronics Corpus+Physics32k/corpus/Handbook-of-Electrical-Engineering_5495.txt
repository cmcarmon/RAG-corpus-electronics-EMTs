The second and third problems are solved by the application of zinc oxide varistors connected line to ground
and across the breaking element. The Ô¨Årst is the major problem, and several different solutions are adopted by
different manufacturers. Basically, current zero is achieved by inserting a counter voltage into the circuit.
