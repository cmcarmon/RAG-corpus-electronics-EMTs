It is important that the spectrum analyzer be more stable in frequency than the signals being 
measured. The stability of the analyzer depends on the frequency stability of its vco. Scan time of the 
spectrum analyzer must be long enough, with respect to the amplitude of the signal to be measured, to 
allow the IF circuitry of the spectrum analyzer to charge and recover. This will prevent amplitude and 
frequency distortion.
