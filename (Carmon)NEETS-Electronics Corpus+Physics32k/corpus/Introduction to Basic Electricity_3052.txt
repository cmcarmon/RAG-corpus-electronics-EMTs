Both germanium and silicon diodes can be damaged 
by excessive heat and excessive reverse voltage. Manu-
facturers specify the maximum forward current 
(iF max) that can be handled safely. They also specify 
the maximum safe reverse voltage (peak inverse 
voltage, or PiV). If the PIV is exceeded, a large 
 reverse  current  flows,  creating  excess  heat  and 
 damaging the diode.
