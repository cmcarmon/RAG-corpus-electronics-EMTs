Classical mechanics is the system of physics begun by Isaac Newton and his contemporaries. It is concerned with the motion of macroscopic objects at speeds well below the speed of light.

Newton, Isaac (1687). Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica [Mathematical principles of natural philosophy] (in Latin).
A three-volume work, often called Principia or Principia Mathematica. One of the most influential scientific books ever published, it contains the statement of Newton's laws of motion forming the foundation of classical mechanics as well as his law of universal gravitation. He derives Kepler's laws for the motion of the planets (which were first obtained empirically).
Lagrange, Joseph Louis (1788). Mécanique Analytique [Analytical mechanics] (in French).
Lagrange's masterpiece on mechanics and hydrodynamics. Based largely on the calculus of variations, this work introduced Lagrangian mechanics including the notion of virtual work, generalized coordinates, and the Lagrangian. Lagrange also further developed the principle of least action and introduced the Lagrangian reference frame for fluid flow.

These three papers used Hamilton's methods in optics to formulate mechanics anew; now called Hamiltonian mechanics.
