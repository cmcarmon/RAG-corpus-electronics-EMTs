Oscilloscopes are also part of some harmonic analysis test equipments that display harmonic energy
levels. To effectively analyze waveform displays, you must know the correct wave shape. The
maintenance instructions manual for each piece of equipment illustrates what waveforms you should
observe at the various test points throughout the equipment. Waveforms that will be observed at any one
selected test point will differ; each waveform will depend on whether the operation of the equipment is
normal or abnormal.
