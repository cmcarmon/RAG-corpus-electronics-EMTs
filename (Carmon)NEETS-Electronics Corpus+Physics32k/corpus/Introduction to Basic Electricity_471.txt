Act of 1990 (ADA) removes the barriers pre-
venting qualified individuals with disabilities 
from being employed, and provides transporta-
tion,  communication, and cultural events that 
are  available to persons without disabilities. It 
is  unlawful for an employer with 15 or more 
 employees to discriminate when recruiting,   
hiring, promoting, training, laying-off, paying,  
firing,  assigning jobs, giving leave, and/or  
providing other benefits because of an employeeâ€™s  
disability.
