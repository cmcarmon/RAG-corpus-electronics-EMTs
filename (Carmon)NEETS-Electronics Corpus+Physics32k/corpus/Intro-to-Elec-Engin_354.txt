Given the two wattmeter readings from the two-wattmeter method used on a three-phase
balanced load, it is possible to ﬁnd the tangent of the phase impedance angle as
3 times the ratio
of the difference between the two wattmeter readings and their sum, based on Equation (4.3.8).
If one knows the system sequence and the lines in which the current coils of the wattmeters are
located, the sign for the angle can be determined with the aid of the following expressions. For
sequence A–B–C,
