and a common voltage ea. An analog electric circuit can then be drawn as in Figure E16.2.1(d) for
a separately excited dc motor, in which the inertia is represented by a capacitance, the damping
by a shunt conductance, and the load–torque component of current is shown ﬂowing through an
equivalent impedance ZL. The time constants, τ i associated with inertia and τm associated with the
damping-type load torque that is proportional to speed (in terms of the analog-circuit notations),
are given by
