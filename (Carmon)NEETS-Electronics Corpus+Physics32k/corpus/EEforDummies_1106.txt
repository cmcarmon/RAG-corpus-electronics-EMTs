Using your multimeter as a voltmeter, you can measure the voltage of a 
 battery outside a circuit or under load (meaning when it is providing power 
in a circuit). You can also use your multimeter with your circuit  powered 
up if you want to test voltages dropped across circuit elements and 
(for that matter) voltages at various points in your circuit with respect to 
ground.
