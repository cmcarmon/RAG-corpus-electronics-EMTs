Once installed and load-locked, an earth anchor exerts effort to the soil above it, with the soil in turn providing resistance. Upward soil compression created by the anchor is typically exerted in a frustum shaped cone, reflecting:
The shear angle of the soil
The depth at which the anchor has been installed
The load applied to the anchor
The size of the anchor and size and angle of its lateral surfaces
When angled these lateral surfaces generate greater cone-shaped soil resistance than a simple cylinder created by purely perpendicular design.
