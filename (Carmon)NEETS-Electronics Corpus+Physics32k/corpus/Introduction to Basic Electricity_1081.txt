Most workshops have hand tools. Hand tools are clas-
sified as any tools that donâ€™t require batteries or need 
to be plugged in to operate. They are typically the easi-
est tools to misplace and lose; therefore, it is impor-
tant to keep them organized. How to organize them 
depends on several factors: the available storage space, 
the number of tools, and how often they are used.
