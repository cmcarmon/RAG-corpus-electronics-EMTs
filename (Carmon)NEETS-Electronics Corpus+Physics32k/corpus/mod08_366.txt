Since no current flows into or out of the inverting input of the operational amplifier, any current
reaching point A from R1 must flow out of point A through R2. Therefore, the input current (Iin) and the
feedback current (Ifdbk) must be equal. Now we can develop a mathematical relationship between the input
and output signals and R1 and R2.
