When gate current is injected in the thyristor, ﬁnite time is
required by the regenerative action to turn the thyristor on
under the inﬂuence of the gate current (see Figure 7.10). A time
delay is observed before the current starts rising. After the
delay time, the anode current rapidly rises toward its on-state
value at a rate limited only by external current elements, and
the device voltage collapses. The ﬁnite time required for the
charge plasma to spread through the device causes a tail in on-
state voltage. The thyristor cannot be turned off by the gate
and turns off naturally when the anode current is forced to
change direction. A thyristor exhibits turn-off reverse recovery
characteristics just like a diode. Excess charge is removed once
the current crosses zero and attains a negative value at a rate
determined by external circuit elements. The reverse recovery
peak is reached when either junction J1 or J3 becomes reverse
biased. The reverse recovery current starts decaying, and the
anode–cathode voltage rapidly attains its off-state value.
