Because of building obstructions such as walls and ceilings, propagation losses indoors can be significantly higher. This occurs because of a combination of attenuation by walls and ceilings, and blockage due to equipment, furniture, and even people.
For example, a “2 x 4” wood stud wall with drywall on both sides results in about 6 dB loss per wall.
Older buildings may have even greater internal losses than new buildings due to materials and line of sight issues.
Experience has shown that line-of-sight propagation holds only for about the first 3 meters. Beyond 3 meters propagation losses indoors can increase at up to 30 dB per 30 meters in dense office environments.
This is a good “rule-of-thumb”, in that it is conservative (it overstates path loss in most cases). Actual propagation losses may vary significantly depending on building construction and layout.
The attenuation of the signal is highly dependent on the frequency of the signal.
