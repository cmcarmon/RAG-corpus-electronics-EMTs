another example of circuit analysis simplification, consider the network of twelve resis-
tors shown in Figure 2.52. Each resistor in the network has resistance R, and together
the network outlines the shape of a cube. Additionally, the network has two terminals
marked A and B, which extend from opposite corners of the cube to form a port. We
wish to determine the equivalent resistance of the network as viewed through this port.
