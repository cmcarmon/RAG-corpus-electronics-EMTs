Erase heads transfer a signal to the magnetic tape that causes the magnetic particles to assume a 
neutralized or erased state. To do this, a high current signal that is 3 to 5 times higher in frequency than 
the maximum frequency response of the record and reproduce heads is used. In some audio recorders, a 
simple direct current (dc) voltage is used.
