Two very different types of stochastic methods have been
researched. The ﬁrst, the hidden Markov model (HMM), is
amenable to computation on conventional sequential comput-
ing machines. Speech research has driven a majority of the
engineering interest in the HMM in the last three decades, and
the HMM has been the basis for several successful large-scale
laboratory and commercial speech recognition systems. In
contrast, the second class of stochastic techniques in speech
recognition based on the artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) has
been a small part of a much more general research effort to
explore alternative computing architectures with some super-
ﬁcial resemblances to the massively parallel computing of
biologic neural systems. ANNs have had relatively little impact
on the speech ﬁeld, and we will not pursue this topic here.
