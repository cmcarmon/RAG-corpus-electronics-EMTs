The monthly IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing frequently publishes articles on the
theory and application of signal restoration and recovery. Signal restoration concepts were discussed in articles
published in the January 1988 issue (pp. 49–62), in the March 1989 issue (pp. 393–401), and in the May 1990
issue (pp. 778–786).
