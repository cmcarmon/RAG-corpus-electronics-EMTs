The pump signal causes the capacitor in figure 2-45A to vary at a 12-gigahertz rate. The 3-gigahertz 
input signal enters via a four-port ferrite circulator, is developed in the signal cavity, and applied across 
the varactor. The nonlinear action of the varactor produces a 9-gigahertz difference frequency (fp-fs) with 
an energy-level higher than the original input signal.
