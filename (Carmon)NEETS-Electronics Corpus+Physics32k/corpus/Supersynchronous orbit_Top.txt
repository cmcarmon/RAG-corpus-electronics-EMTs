A supersynchronous orbit is either an orbit with a period greater than that of a synchronous orbit, or just an orbit whose apsis (apogee in the case of the earth) is higher than that of a synchronous orbit. A synchronous orbit has a period equal to the rotational period of the body which contains the barycenter of the orbit.
