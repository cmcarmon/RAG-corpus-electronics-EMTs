media players), consumer electronics (e.g., television set-top
boxes, digital video recorders, television browsers, Internet
appliances), and mobile applications (e.g., cell phones, wireless
computers) (Bickmore and Schlit, 1997; Smith et al., 1999,
1998b; Han and Smith, 2000). UMA is partially addressed by
scalable or layered encoding, progressive data representation,
and object- and scene-based encodings (such as MPEG-4) that
inherently provide different embedded levels of content quality
(Vetro et al., 1999). From the network perspective, UMA
involves important concepts related to the growing variety of
communication channels, dynamic bandwidth variation, and
perceptual quality of service (QoS) (Mohan and Smith, 1999,
1998). UMA involves different preferences of the user (recipi-
ents of the content) and the content publisher in choosing the
form, quality, and personalization of the content. UMA prom-
ises to integrate these different perspectives into a new class of
content-adaptive applications that allows users to access multi-
media content without concern for speciÔ¨Åc encodings, ter-
minal capabilities, or network conditions.
