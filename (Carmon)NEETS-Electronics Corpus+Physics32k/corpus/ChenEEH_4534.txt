What may be surprising is that for most commonly encoun-
tered systems, the nonlinear function f can be completely
described by four matrices that permit the connection function
to be manipulated quite readily. Indeed, feasible analytical and
computational techniques based on this point of view have
been developed and applied to problems in system analysis
(Singh and Trauboth, 1973; Prasad and Reiss, 1970; Trauboth
and Prasad, 1970), sensitivity studies (Ransom, 1973, 1972;
Ransom and Saeks, 1975; DeCarlo, 1983), synthesis (Ransom,
1973), stability analysis (Lu and Liu, 1972), optimization
(Richardson, 1969; Richardson et al., 1969), well-posedness
(Ransom, 1972; Singh, 1972), and fault analysis (Ransom,
1973, 1972; Saeks, 1970; Saeks et al., 1972; Ransom and
Saeks, 1973a, 1973b; DeCarlo and Rapisarda, 1988; Reisig
and DeCarlo, 1987; Rapisarda and DeCarlo, 1983; Garzia,
1971). The reason for this core of linearity in the f description
is that connection information is generally contained in ‘‘con-
servation’’ laws that, upon the proper choice of system vari-
ables, yield linear ‘‘connection’’ equations.
