Symbols are used to represent functions. These fundamental functions are processing, decision, 
input/output, terminal, flow lines, and connector symbol. All flowcharts may be initially constructed 
using only these fundamental symbols as a rough outline to work from. Each symbol corresponds to one 
of the functions of a computer and specifies the instruction(s) to be performed by the computer. The 
contents of these symbols are called statements. Samples of these fundamental symbols, definitions, 
examples, and explanations of their uses are shown in figure 3-3.
