which gives a = 1.04 and 3.86 for d = 1 and h = p. Using the perturbation method or the IDF criterion, the
smallest amplitude limit cycle is unstable and the larger one is stable. If a condition similar to the lower amplitude
limit cycle is excited in the system, an oscillation will build up and stabilize at the higher amplitude limit cycle.
Other techniques show that the exact frequencies of the limit cycles for the smaller and larger amplitudes
are 0.709 and 0.989, respectively. Although the transfer function is a good low pass Ô¨Ålter, the frequency of the
smallest amplitude limit cycle is not predicted accurately because the output from the relay, a wave form with
narrow pulses, is highly distorted.
