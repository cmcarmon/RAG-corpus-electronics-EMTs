Peregrine (1976) identifies five major sub-classes within wave–current interaction:
interaction of waves with a large-scale current field, with slow – as compared to the wavelength – two-dimensional horizontal variations of the current fields;
interaction of waves with small-scale current changes (in contrast with the case above), where the horizontal current varies suddenly, over a length scale comparable with the wavelength;
the combined wave–current motion for currents varying (strongly) with depth below the free surface;
interaction of waves with turbulence; and
interaction of ship waves and currents, such as in the ship's wake.
