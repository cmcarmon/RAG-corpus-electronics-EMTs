Plasma osmolarity can be calculated from plasma osmolality by the following equation:
Osmolarity = osmolality * (ρsol − ca)
where:
ρsol is the density of the solution in g/ml, which is 1.025 g/ml for blood plasma.
ca is the (anhydrous) solute concentration in g/ml – not to be confused with the density of dried plasma
According to IUPAC, osmolality is the quotient of the negative natural logarithm of the rational activity of water and the molar mass of water, whereas osmolarity is the product of the osmolality and the mass density of water (also known as osmotic concentration).
In simpler terms, osmolality is an expression of solute osmotic concentration per mass of solvent, whereas osmolarity is per volume of solution (thus the conversion by multiplying with the mass density of solvent in solution (kg solvent/kg solution).

where mi is the molality of component i.
Plasma osmolarity/osmolality is important for keeping proper electrolytic balance in the blood stream. Improper balance can lead to dehydration, alkalosis, acidosis or other life-threatening changes. Antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin) is partly responsible for this process by controlling the amount of water the body retains from the kidney when filtering the blood stream.
