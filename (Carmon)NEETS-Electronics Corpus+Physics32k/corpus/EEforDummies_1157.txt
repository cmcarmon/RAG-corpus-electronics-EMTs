Bear in mind that many digital meters are limited to testing currents of 200 mA 
or less. Be careful: Don’t test higher current if your meter isn’t equipped to do 
so. And never leave your multimeter in an ammeter position after measuring 
current. You can damage the meter. Get in the habit of turning off the meter 
immediately after running a current test.
