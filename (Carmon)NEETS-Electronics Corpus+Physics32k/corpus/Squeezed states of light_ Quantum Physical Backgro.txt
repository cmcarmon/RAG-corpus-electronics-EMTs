An oscillating physical quantity cannot have precisely defined values at all phases of the oscillation! This is true for the electric and magnetic fields of an electro-magnetic wave, as well as for any other wave or oscillation (see figure right). This fact can be observed in experiments and is correctly described by quantum theory. For electro-magnetic waves we usually consider just the electric field, because it is the one that mainly interacts with matter.
Fig. 1. shows five different quantum states that a monochromatic wave could be in. The difference of the five quantum states is given by different electric field excitations and by different distributions of the quantum uncertainty along the phase

. For a displaced coherent state, the expectation (mean) value of the electric field clearly shows an oscillation, with an uncertainty independent of the phase (a). Also the phase- (b) and amplitude-squeezed states (c) show an oscillation of the mean electric field, but here the uncertainty depends on phase and is squeezed for some phases. The vacuum state (d) is a special coherent state and is not squeezed. It has zero mean electric field for all phases and a phase-independent uncertainty. It has zero energy on average, i.e. zero photons, and is the ground state of the monochromatic wave we consider. Finally, a squeezed vacuum state has also a zero mean electric field but a phase-dependent uncertainty (e).
Generally, quantum uncertainty reveals itself through a large number of identical measurements on identical quantum objects (here: modes of light) that, however, give different results. Let us again consider a continuous-wave monochromatic light wave (as emitted by an ultra-stable laser). A single measurement of Ԑ
