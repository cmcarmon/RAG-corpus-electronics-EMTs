Because the resonator is always coupled to an external circuity,
the coupling scheme is another important aspect in the design
of a resonant circuit. Usually, a gap or an aperture is used as
the coupling structure. The choice of an adequate coupling
mechanism depends on the type of mode one wants to excite
