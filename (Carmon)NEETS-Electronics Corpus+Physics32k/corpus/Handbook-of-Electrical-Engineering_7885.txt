Figure  81.22  shows  a  PAL16L8  implementation  for  the  binary  to
seven-segment hexadecimal character generator that also requires just a
single IC package. The fuse map for this design was obtained using the
software program PLDesigner-XL. Karnaugh maps are handy tools that
allow a designer to easily obtain minimum SOP equations for either the
1’s or 0’s of Boolean functions of up to four or ﬁve variables; however,
there are a host of commercially available software programs that pro-
vide not only Boolean reduction but also equation simulation and fuse
map generation for PLDs and ﬁeld programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).
PLDesigner-XL (trademark of Minc, Incorporated) is an example of
a premier commercial software package available for logic synthesis
for  PLDs  and  FPGAs,  for  both  combinational  logic  and  sequential
logic circuits.
