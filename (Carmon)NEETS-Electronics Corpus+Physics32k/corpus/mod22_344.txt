Data management software allows you to enter data and then retrieve it in a variety of ways. You 
define your data fields and set up a display screen with prompts. You enter the data records according to 
the prompts. Figure 3-9, view A, shows an example. The system writes the records on a disk or tape. 
Once you have a file keyed and stored, you can retrieve records by a field or several fields or by searching 
the records for specific data. For example, if you wanted a list of all personnel who reported aboard 
before January 1988, you could tell the system to search the file and print selected fields of all records 
that meet that condition. You tell the system what fields to print (that is name, rate, SSN, date reported) 
and where (what print positions) to print them. At the same time, you can specify in what order you want 
the records printed. For example, figure 3-9, view B, shows the records printed in alphabetical order by 
last name. The software also provides routines so you can easily add, delete, and change records.
