where G is the gravitational constant and M the earth’s mass. Calculations yield R = 42200 km, which
corresponds to an altitude of 35700 km. This altitude greatly exceeds that of the ionosphere, requiring
satellite transmitters to use frequencies that pass through it. Of great importance in satellite communications
is the transmission delay. The time for electromagnetic ﬁelds to propagate to a geosynchronous satellite and
return is 0.24 s, a signiﬁcant delay.
