Blue and white sillitoe tartan is used by the several local Spanish police forces. Both the Toledo and Mijas local policia use a three tiered version on vehicles in a fashion very similar to Australian police vehicles. The Ajuntament de Sóller and Barcelona (Guàrdia Urbana) local Policía both use two tiered blue and white versions.
