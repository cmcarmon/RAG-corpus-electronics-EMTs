A digital signal processor stores information about a speciﬁc user and his or her optimal electrode locations
for speciﬁc frequency bands. The object is to determine what pair of electrodes best produces the subjective
, and then to associate a particular
perception of a certain pitch 
ﬁlter  with  that  pair  via  the  controller. An  enormous  amount  of  compression  occurs  in  taking  the  frequency
range necessary for speech comprehension and reducing it to a few discrete channels. At present, the optimum
compression algorithm is unknown, and much fundamental research is being carried out in speech processing,
compression, and recognition. But, what is amazing is that a number of totally deaf individuals can relearn to
comprehend speech exceptionally well without speech-reading through the use of these implants. Other indi-
viduals ﬁnd that the implant aids in speech-reading. For some, only an awareness of environmental sounds is
apparent; and for another group, the implant appears to have little effect. But, if you could (as I have been able
to) ﬁnally converse in unaided speech with an individual who had been rendered totally blind and deaf by a
traumatic brain injury, you would certainly begin to appreciate the power of rehabilitation engineering.
