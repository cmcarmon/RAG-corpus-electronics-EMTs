Monostable pulse generator 
 
Figure  12.3  shows  a  standard  555  timer  operating 
as a monostable pulse generator. The monostable 
timing period (i.e. the time for which the output is 
high)  is  initiated  by  a  falling  edge  trigger  pulse 
applied to the trigger input (pin-2), see Fig. 12.4. 
  When  this  falling  edge  trigger  pulse  is  received 
and falls below one-third of the supply voltage, the 
output  of  IC2  goes  high  and  the  bistable  will  be 
placed in the set state. The inverted Q output of the 
bistable  then  goes  low, TR1  is  placed  in  the  off 
(non-conducting) state and the output voltage (pin-
3) goes high. 
  The capacitor, C, then charges through the series 
resistor, R, until the voltage  at the threshold input 
reaches  two-thirds  of  the  supply  voltage  (Vcc).  At 
this  point,  the  output  of  the  upper  comparator 
changes state and the bistable is reset. The inverted 
Q output  then  goes  high,  TR1  is  driven  into 
conduction  and  the  final  output  goes  low. The 
device  then  remains  in  the  inactive  state  until 
another falling trigger pulse is received. 
  The  trigger  and  output  waveforms  produced  by 
the circuit of Fig. 12.3 are shown in Fig. 12.4. The 
waveform has the following properties:
