Demagnetizing ﬁeld: The magnetic ﬁeld produced by divergences in the magnetization of a magnetic sample.
Magnetoresistance: The resistance change produced in a magnetic sample when its magnetization is changed.
Remanence coercivity: The magnetic ﬁeld required to produce zero remanent magnetization in a material
