FIGURE 80.27  Focus error detection by the obscuration method. In (a) the disk is in focus, and the two halves of the split
detector receive equal amounts of light. When the disk is too far from the objective (b) or too close to it (c), the balance of
detector signals shifts to one side or the other. A plot of the focus error signal (FES) versus defocus is shown in (d), and its
slope near the origin is identiÔ¨Åed as the FES gain, G.
