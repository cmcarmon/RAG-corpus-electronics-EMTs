In order to represent the abrupt changes in excitation, encountered when a switch is opened
or closed and in individual sequences of pulses, singularity functions are introduced. This type of
representation leads to the step and impulse functions. The methods for evaluating the transient
(natural) and steady-state (forced) components of the response can also be applied to these
excitations.
