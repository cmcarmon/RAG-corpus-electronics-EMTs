The two equations that describe the deformation of a Timoshenko beam have to be augmented with boundary conditions if they are to be solved. Four boundary conditions are needed for the problem to be well-posed. Typical boundary conditions are:
Simply supported beams: The displacement



w


{\displaystyle w}
is zero at the locations of the two supports. The bending moment




M

x
x




{\displaystyle M_{xx}}
applied to the beam also has to be specified. The rotation



φ


{\displaystyle \varphi }
and the transverse shear force




Q

x




{\displaystyle Q_{x}}
are not specified.
Clamped beams: The displacement



w


{\displaystyle w}
and the rotation



φ


{\displaystyle \varphi }
are specified to be zero at the clamped end. If one end is free, shear force




Q

x




{\displaystyle Q_{x}}
and bending moment




M

x
x




{\displaystyle M_{xx}}
have to be specified at that end.
