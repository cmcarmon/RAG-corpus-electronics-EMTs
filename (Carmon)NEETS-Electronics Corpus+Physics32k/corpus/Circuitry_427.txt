 Positive versus negative feedback 
 
We have already shown how negative feedback can 
be  applied  to  an  operational  amplifier  in  order  to 
produce an exact value of gain. Negative feedback 
is  frequently  used  in  order  to  stabilize  the  gain  of 
an  amplifier  and  also  to  increase  the  frequency 
response (recall that, for an amplifier the product of 
gain  and  bandwidth 
is  a  constant).  Positive 
feedback, on the other hand, results in an increase 
in gain and a reduction in bandwidth. Furthermore, 
the  usual  result  of  applying  positive  feedback  is 
that  an  amplifier  becomes  unstable  and  oscillates 
(i.e.  it  generates  an  output  without  an  input  being 
present!). For this reason, positive feedback is only 
used  in  amplifiers  when  the  voltage  gain  is  less 
than unity. 
  The important thing to remember from all of this 
is  that,  when  negative  feedback  is  applied  to  an 
amplifier  the  overall  gain  is  reduced  and  the 
bandwidth  is  increased  (note  that  the  gain  Ã— 
bandwidth  product 
remains  constant).  When 
positive  feedback  is  applied  to  an  amplifier  the 
overall  gain 
is 
reduced. In most cases this will result in instability 
and oscillation.
