 
Permittivity 
 
The amount of charge produced on the two plates 
shown  in Fig. 1.9 for a given applied voltage  will 
depend  not  only  on  the  physical  dimensions  but 
also  on  the  insulating  dielectric  material  that 
appears between the plates. Such materials need to 
have a very high value of resistivity (they must not 
conduct  charge)  coupled  with  an  ability 
to 
withstand high voltages without breaking down.  
  A more  practical  arrangement  is  shown  in  Fig. 
1.10. In this arrangement the ratio of charge, Q, to 
potential difference, V, is given by the relationship: 
=Q
V
