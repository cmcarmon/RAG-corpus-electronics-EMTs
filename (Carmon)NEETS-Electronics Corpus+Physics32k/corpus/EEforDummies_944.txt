The potential dangers of DC currents are not to be ignored either. Burns are 
the most common form of injury caused by high DC current. Remember that 
voltage doesnâ€™t have to come from a power plant to be dangerous. It pays to 
respect even a 9 V transistor battery: If you short its terminals, the battery 
may overheat and can even explode. Battery explosions often send tiny bat-
tery pieces flying out at high velocities, burning skin or injuring eyes. Many 
people have been burned by placing a battery in a pocket along with coins, 
keys, or other metallic objects. When the battery terminals are shorted, the 
battery heats up quickly.
