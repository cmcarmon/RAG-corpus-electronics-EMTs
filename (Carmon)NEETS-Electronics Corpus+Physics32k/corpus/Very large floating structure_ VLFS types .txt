Pontoon-type VLFS are also known in the literature as mat-like VLFS because of their small draft in relation to the length dimensions. Very large pontoon-type floating structures are often called Mega-Floats. As a rule, the Mega-Float is a floating structure having at least one length dimension greater than 60 meters. Horizontally large floating structures can be from 500 to 5000 meters in length and 100 to 1000 meters in width, with typical thickness of 2 to 10 meters.
Air-cushion supported Mega-Floaters are mega floaters that are supported by an air cushion. They were invented by Jan Van Kessel of TU Delft.
