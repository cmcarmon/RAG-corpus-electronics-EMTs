The May 31, 1897 event was the strongest in Virginia's history. With a maximum Mercalli intensity of VIII (Severe) this shock destroyed many chimneys and created ground effects over a large area. It had a magnitude of 5.6 Mfa (a seismic scale that is based on an isoseismal map or the event's felt area) and had severe effects in Narrows, where ground motion was observed and the flow of streams was disrupted.
