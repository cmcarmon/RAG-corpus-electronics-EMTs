When you look at figure 4-3, you will notice that the four rightmost bits in EBCDIC are assigned 
values of 8, 4, 2, and 1. The next four bits to the left are called the zone bits. The EBCDIC coding chart 
for uppercase and lowercase alphabetic characters and for the numeric digits 0 through 9 is shown in 
figure 4-4, with their hexadecimal equivalents. Hexadecimal is a number system used with some 
computer systems. It has a base of 16 (0-9 and A-F). A represents 10; B represents 11; C represents 12; D 
represents 13; E represents 14; and F represents 15. In EBCDIC, the bit pattern 1100 is the zone 
combination used for the alphabetic characters A through I, 1101 is used for the characters J through R, 
and 1110 is the zone combination used for characters S through Z. The bit pattern 1111 is the zone 
combination used when representing decimal digits. For example, the code 11000001 is equivalent to the 
letter A; the code 11110001 is equivalent to the decimal digit 1. Other zone combinations are used when 
forming special characters. Not all of the 256 combinations of 8-bit code have been assigned characters. 
Figure 4-5 illustrates how the characters DP-3 are represented using EBCDIC.
