The snare drum is the heart of the drum kit, particularly in rock, due to the use of the snare to play the backbeat. It provides the strongest regular accents, played by the left hand (if right handed), and the backbone for many fills. It produces its distinctive sound due to the bed of stiff snare wires held under tension to the underside of the lower drum head. When the stiff wire are "engaged" (held under tension), they vibrate with the top (snare-side) drum skin (head) when the head is hit, creating a snappy, staccato buzzing sound, along with the sound of the stick striking the head.
