One difference between Gaussian and SI units is in the factors of 4π in various formulas. SI electromagnetic units are called "rationalized", because Maxwell's equations have no explicit factors of 4π in the formulae. On the other hand, the inverse-square force laws – Coulomb's law and the Biot–Savart law – do have a factor of 4π attached to the r 2. In unrationalized Gaussian units (not Lorentz–Heaviside units) the situation is reversed: Two of Maxwell's equations have factors of 4π in the formulas, while both of the inverse-square force laws, Coulomb's law and the Biot–Savart law, have no factor of 4π attached to r 2 in the denominator.
(The quantity 4π appears because 4πr 2 is the surface area of the sphere of radius r. For details, see the articles Relation between Gauss's law and Coulomb's law and Inverse-square law.)
