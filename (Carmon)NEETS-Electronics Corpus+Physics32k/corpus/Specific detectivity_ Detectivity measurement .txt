Detectivity can be measured from a suitable optical setup using known parameters. You will need a known light source with known irradiance at a given standoff distance. The incoming light source will be chopped at a certain frequency, and then each wavelet will be integrated over a given time constant over a given number of frames.
In detail, we compute the bandwidth

Next, an average signal and rms noise needs to be measured from a set of

{\displaystyle N}

Now, the computation of the radiance



H


{\displaystyle H}
in W/sr/cm² must be computed where cm² is the emitting area. Next, emitting area must be converted into a projected area and the solid angle; this product is often called the etendue. This step can be obviated by the use of a calibrated source, where the exact number of photons/s/cm² is known at the detector. If this is unknown, it can be estimated using the black-body radiation equation, detector active area




A

d




{\displaystyle A_{d}}
and the etendue. This ultimately converts the outgoing radiance of the black body in W/sr/cm² of emitting area into one of W observed on the detector.
The broad-band responsivity, is then just the signal weighted by this wattage.

Where,




R


{\displaystyle R}
is the responsivity in units of Signal / W, (or sometimes V/W or A/W)




H


{\displaystyle H}
is the outgoing radiance from the black body (or light source) in W/sr/cm² of emitting area




G


{\displaystyle G}
is the total integrated etendue between the emitting source and detector surface





A

d




{\displaystyle A_{d}}
is the detector area





Ω

B
B




{\displaystyle \Omega _{BB}}
is the solid angle of the source projected along the line connecting it to the detector surface.
From this metric noise-equivalent power can be computed by taking the noise level over the responsivity.

Similarly, noise-equivalent irradiance can be computed using the responsivity in units of photons/s/W instead of in units of the signal. Now, the detectivity is simply the noise-equivalent power normalized to the bandwidth and detector area.
