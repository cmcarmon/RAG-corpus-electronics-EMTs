Cinching happens when a tape reel is stopped too quickly. The sudden stop causes the outer layers of
magnetic tape to continue to spin after the inner layers have stopped. This causes any loosely wound tape
within the pack to unwind and pile up. Figure 2-2 shows an example of a cinched tape pack (note the
complete foldover of one tape strand).
