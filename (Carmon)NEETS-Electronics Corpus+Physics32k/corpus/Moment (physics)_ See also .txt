Moment of force (or torque) – see also the article couple (mechanics)
Moment (mathematics)
Mechanical equilibrium – applies when an object is balanced so that the sum of the clockwise moments about a pivot is equal to the sum of the anticlockwise moments about the same pivot
Moment of inertia –



(
I
=
Σ
m

r

2


)


{\displaystyle (I=\Sigma mr^{2})}
is analogous to mass in discussions of rotational motion. It is a measure of an object's resistance to changes in its rotation rate
Moment of momentum –



(

L

=

r

×
m

v

)


{\displaystyle (\mathbf {L} =\mathbf {r} \times m\mathbf {v} )}
is the rotational analog of linear momentum.
Magnetic moment –



(

μ

=
I

A

)


{\displaystyle (\mathbf {\mu } =I\mathbf {A} )}
is a dipole moment measuring the strength and direction of a magnetic source.
Electric dipole moment – a dipole moment measuring the charge difference and direction between two or more charges. For example, the electric dipole moment between a charge of –q and q separated by a distance of d is



(

p

=

d

)


{\displaystyle (\mathbf {p} =q\mathbf {d} )}
