terminal voltage when the bulb is initially connected will be properly represented
in the circuit model of Figure 1.38 if the value of R is appropriately chosen.
However, the model is still not exact. For example, if a lightbulb is connected
to a battery for some time, the battery voltage will slowly drop as the energy
is drained from the battery. The model battery will not ‘‘run down,’’ but will
continue to light the bulb indefinitely.
