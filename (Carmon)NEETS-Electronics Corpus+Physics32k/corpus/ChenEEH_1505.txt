Level 14 is the shell that separates the user from the rest of
the operating system. The shell interprets a high-level com-
mand language through which the user gives instructions to
the system. Incorporating a listener program, usually called a
command interpreter, that responds to a terminal’s keyboard,
the shell parses each line of input to identify program names
and parameters, creates and invokes a user process for each
program, and connects those as needed to pipes, ﬁles, and
devices. Many shells incorporate window managers that allow
users to refer to objects by manipulating icons denoting those
objects on the display screen and that allow objects to send and
receive data from different regions of the display.
