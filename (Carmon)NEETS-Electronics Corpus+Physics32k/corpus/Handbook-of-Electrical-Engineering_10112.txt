Articulated Conﬁguration
The  articulated  (or  anthropomorphic,  jointed,  arm-and-elbow)  conﬁgu-
ration consists of three revolute joints (RRR), as shown in Fig. 101.7. The
resulting joint coordinates do not directly match any standard coordinate
system. A slice of a typical work envelope for an articulated robot is shown
in Fig. 101.8.
