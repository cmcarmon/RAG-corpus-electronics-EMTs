Snoopy protocols distribute the responsibility for cache co-
herence between all cache controllers. Some mechanism must
be incorporated so that each cache knows when a line is also in
another cache. If this line is subsequently updated, it must
inform the other caches that this update has taken place. There
are two approaches in snoopy systems: either the write is
broadcasted to all caches so that they can update their line
accordingly (write-broadcast), or the write is simply used to
invalidate the lines in the other caches (write-invalidate). The
MESI protocol is an example of write-invalidate and is used by
the Pentium II processor (Shanley, 1998).
