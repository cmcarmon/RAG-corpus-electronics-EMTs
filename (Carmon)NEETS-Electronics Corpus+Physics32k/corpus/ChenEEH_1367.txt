Machine-speciﬁc libraries for process creation, remote data
access, and bulk synchronization have been developed to assist
BSP programmers. There are native libraries for IBM’s SP2,
Cray’s T3D, and Silicon Graphics’s Power Challenge and other
parallel systems. There is also a generic version for any homo-
geneous parallel Unix machine that has access to PARMACS,
PVM, TCP/IP, or System V Shared Memory primitives (Poun-
tain, 1996). These libraries simplify parallel program develop-
ment: they also facilitate performance estimation for speciﬁc
parallel machines.
