Multiported memories increase the bandwidth roughly lin-
early with the number of ports. A complete double wiring
accomplishes the improvement. Unfortunately, this will also
heavily increase the area of the memory matrix. Due to this
increase, the average wire length increases as well. Therefore,
the energy consumption and the cost in general will go up
rapidly when using multiport memories. To this end, multi-
port memories have to be avoided as much as possible in
energy-efÔ¨Åcient solutions.
