Muon-catalyzed fusion is a fusion process that occurs at ordinary temperatures. It was studied in detail by Steven Jones in the early 1980s. Net energy production from this reaction has been unsuccessful because of the high energy required to create muons, their short 2.2 Âµs half-life, and the high chance that a muon will bind to the new alpha particle and thus stop catalyzing fusion.
