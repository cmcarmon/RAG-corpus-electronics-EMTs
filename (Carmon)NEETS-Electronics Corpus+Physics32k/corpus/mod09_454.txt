Decreasing the value of the TC (R2 or C2), as shown in figure 3-43, view (B), results in an increase 
in the number of time constants and therefore causes linearity to decrease. Anytime the number of time 
constants increases, the percentage of charge increases (see the Universal Time Constant Chart, figure 3-
39), and amplitude (physical length) increases. Without an increase in gate length, the time that C2 is 
allowed to charge through R2 remains the same; therefore, electrical length remains the same. Linearity is 
affected by gate length, the value of R, and the value of C; but is not affected by changing the value of 
VCC. Increasing the gate length decreases linearity, and decreasing gate length increases linearity. 
Increasing R or C in the circuit increases linearity, and decreasing R or C in the circuit decreases linearity.
