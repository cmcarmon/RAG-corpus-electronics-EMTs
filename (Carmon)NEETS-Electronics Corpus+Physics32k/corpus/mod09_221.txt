Output power is another consideration in the use of oscillators. Generally speaking, high power is 
obtained at some sacrifice to stability. When both requirements are to be met, a low-power, stable 
oscillator can be followed by a higher-power BUFFER AMPLIFIER. The buffer provides isolation 
between the oscillator and the load to prevent changes in the load from affecting the oscillator.
