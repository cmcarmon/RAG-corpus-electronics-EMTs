Furthermore, we only need to consider the Ô¨Åring of a relevant
transition and the associated Z schema with regard to the given
property under the guidance of the net structure during step 3.
For example, a system deadlock may occur when a particular
place has a special marking. To show the system does not have
the deadlock, we only need to show that transitions connected
to this place cannot result in this special marking. Therefore,
the proof is in general local in the sense that only a subset of
transitions needs to be considered. Similar ideas have been also
explored in other temporal analysis techniques (He and Lee,
1990; He and Ding, 1992). In general, logical, net structural,
and net behavioral reasonings are needed to prove an invariant
property. The above temporal induction technique is demon-
strated in the following example.
