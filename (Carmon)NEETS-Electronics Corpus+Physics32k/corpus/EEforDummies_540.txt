The doping process increases the conductivity of the semiconductors. If you 
apply a voltage source across either an N‐type or a P‐type semiconductor, 
electrons move through the material from the more negative voltage toward 
the more positive voltage. (For P‐type semiconductors, this action is described 
as a movement of holes from the more positive voltage toward the more nega­
tive voltage.) In other words, N‐type and P‐type semiconductors are acting like 
conductors, allowing current to flow in response to an applied voltage.
