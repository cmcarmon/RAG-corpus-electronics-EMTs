supply  voltage  (VCC) whilst  that  at  the  inverting 
input  of  IC2  is  two-thirds  of  the  supply  voltage 
(VCC). Hence if VCC is 9 V, 3 V will appear at each 
resistor  and  the  upper  comparator  will  have  6  V 
applied  to  its  inverting  input  whilst  the  lower 
comparator will have 3V at its non-inverting input.
