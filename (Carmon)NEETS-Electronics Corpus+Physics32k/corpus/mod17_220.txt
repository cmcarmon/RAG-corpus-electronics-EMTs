The carrier reinsertion oscillator frequency is set to the IF frequency that would have resulted had the
carrier been present. For example, assume that a transmitter with a suppressed carrier frequency of 3
megahertz is radiating an upper sideband signal. Also assume that the intelligence consists of a
1-kilohertz tone. The transmitted sideband frequency will be 3,001 kilohertz. If the receiver has a
500-kilohertz IF, the correct local oscillator frequency is 3,500 kilohertz. The output of the mixer to the IF
stages will be the difference frequency, 499 kilohertz. Therefore, the carrier reinsertion oscillator
frequency will be 500 kilohertz, which will maintain the frequency relationship of the carrier to the
sideband at 1 kilohertz.
