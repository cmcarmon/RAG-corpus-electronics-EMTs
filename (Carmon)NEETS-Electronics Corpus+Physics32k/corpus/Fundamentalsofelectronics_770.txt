Exercise 6.4
(Solution on p. 255.)
Derive the expression of line-of-sight distance using only the Pythagorean Theorem. Generalize it to
the case where the antennas have diï¬€erent heights (as is the case with commercial radio and cellular
telephone). What is the range of cellular telephone where the handset antenna has essentially zero
height?
Exercise 6.5
(Solution on p. 255.)
Can you imagine a situation wherein global wireless communication is possible with only one trans-
mitting antenna? In particular, what happens to wavelength when carrier frequency decreases?
