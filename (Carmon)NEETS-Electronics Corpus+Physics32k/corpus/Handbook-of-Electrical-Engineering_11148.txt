Physical variables associated with biomedical systems are measured by a group of sensors known as physical
sensors. A list of typical variables that are frequently measured by these devices is given in Table 114.2. These
quantities are similar to physical quantities measured by sensors for nonbiomedical applications, and the devices
used for biomedical and nonbiomedical sensing are, therefore, quite similar. There are, however, two principal
exceptions: pressure and ï¬‚ow sensors.
