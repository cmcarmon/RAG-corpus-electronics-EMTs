Protective relays are devices that are connected to instrument
transformers to receive input signals and to circuit breakers to
issue control commands for opening or closing. In some
instances, the relays are also connected to the communication
channels to exchange information with other relays. The elec-
tronic relays always require a power supply, which is com-
monly provided through a connection to the station dc
battery. Often, relays are connected to some auxiliary moni-
toring and control equipment to allow for coordination with
other similar equipment and supervision by the operators.
In the high-voltage power systems, relays are located in sub-
stations and, most frequently, in a control house. The connec-
tions to the instrument transformers and circuit breakers
located in the substation switchyard are done through stan-
dard wiring originating from the substation switchyard and
terminating in the control house.
