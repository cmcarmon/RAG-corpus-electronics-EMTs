Conclusion 
Comment on the shape of each graph. Is this what 
you would expect? Is the graph linear? If not, what 
will  this  imply  about  the  static  and  small-signal 
values of current gain? Which of the transistors had 
the highest value of current gain and which had the 
least value of current gain?
