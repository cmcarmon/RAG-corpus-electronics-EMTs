Various attempts have been made to explain the apparent or observed thrust. However, to date, there is no acceptance or consensus how or why these cavities produce thrust, if they produce thrust at all. Attempts to explain the thrust can fall into three categories:
Measured thrust values are the result of measurement errors. Most theoretical scientists who have looked at the EmDrive believe this to be the likely case.
Changes in the electromagnetic or vacuum field, so that momentum changes of the field balances the change in momentum of the thruster.
Some exhaust is not being properly measured or taken into account.
The simplest and most likely explanation is that any thrust detected is due to experimental error or noise, but there is a possibility that new physics may be involved.
