The coincidence factor is the reciprocal of the diversity factor. However, differing sources define the simultaneity factor to be identical to either the coincidence factor or the diversity factor. The International Electrotechnical Commission defines the coincidence and simultaneity factors identically with the diversity factor being the reciprocal. Since the only change in definition is to take the inverse, all one needs to know is if the factor is greater than or less than one.
