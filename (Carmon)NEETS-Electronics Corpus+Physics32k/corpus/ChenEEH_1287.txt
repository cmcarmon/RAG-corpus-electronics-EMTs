. CD-rewritable (CD-RW) technology allows individuals
and companies to write, erase, and rewrite CD-ROMs.
Unlike CD-R, CD-RW uses a reﬂecting alloy that
possesses two stable states, crystalline and amorphous.
These two states reﬂect light differently. Inside CD-RW
drive, three levels of laser power can be used. At high
power, the alloy melts and loses some of its reﬂectivity
(amorphous state). This in effect simulates pits. At
medium power, the alloy melts again, but this time
returns to its crystalline state and regains its reﬂectivity
(returns lands). At low power, the disk is read but there
is no state change. Because CD-RWs still cost consider-
ably more than CD-Rs, they are not as widely used as
CD-Rs.
