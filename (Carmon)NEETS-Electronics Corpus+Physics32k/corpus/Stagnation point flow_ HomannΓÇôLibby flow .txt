The corresponding problem in axisymmetric coordinate is solved by Homann(1936) and this serves a model for flow around near the stagnation point of a sphere. Paul A. Libby(1974)(1976) considered Homann flow with constantly moving plate with velocity



U


{\displaystyle U}
and also allowed for suction/injection with velocity



V


{\displaystyle V}
at the surface.
The self-similar solution is obtained by introducing following transformation for the velocity
