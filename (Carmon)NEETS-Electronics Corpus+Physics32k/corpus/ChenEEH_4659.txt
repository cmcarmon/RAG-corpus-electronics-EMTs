Characteristics inherent to the IC engine idle speed control
problem—an induction-to-power delay and ﬁnite sensor/ac-
tuator response time—can lead to design challenges with re-
spect to disturbance rejection and/or lead to problems of
chattering with traditional SMC designs. For this reason, the
idle speed control problem is chosen as a focus for application
here, and both techniques for SMC described in this chapter
(for point-delay systems and adaptive DSMC) are applied to
the problem, where simulation and experimental results are
provided.
