Model-Based Approach
The  model-based  approach  [Ephraim,  1992]  is  a  Bayesian  approach  for  estimating  the  clean  signal  or  any
functional of that signal from the observed noisy signal. This approach assumes CSMs for the clean signal and
noise  process.  The  models  are  estimated  from  training  sequences  of  those  processes  using  the  maximum
likelihood (ML) estimation approach. Under ideal conditions the ML model estimate is consistent and asymp-
totically  efﬁcient.  The  ML  model  estimation  is  performed  using  the  expectation-maximization  (EM)  or  the
Baum iterative algorithm [Rabiner, 1989; Ephraim, 1992]. Given the CSMs for the signal and noise, the clean
signal  is  estimated  by  minimizing  the  expected  value  of  the  chosen  distortion  measure.  The  model-based
approach uses signiﬁcantly more statistical knowledge about the signal and noise compared to either the spectral
subtraction or the sample average approaches.
