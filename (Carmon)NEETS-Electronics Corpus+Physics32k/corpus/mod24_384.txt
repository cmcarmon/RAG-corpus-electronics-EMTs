If high splice loss results from assembling some mechanical splices, the splice can be reopened and
the fibers realigned. Realignment includes wiping the fiber or ferrule end with a soft wipe, reinserting the
fiber or ferrule in a new arrangement, and adding new refractive index material. Once producing an
acceptable mechanical splice, splice realignment should be unnecessary because most mechanical splices
are environmentally and mechanically stable within their intended application.
