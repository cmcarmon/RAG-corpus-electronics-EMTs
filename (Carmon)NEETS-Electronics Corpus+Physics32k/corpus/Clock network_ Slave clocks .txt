Slave clocks come in many shapes and sizes. They can connect to the master clock through either a cable or a short-range wireless signal. In the 19th century Paris used a series of pneumatic tubes to transmit the signal. Some slave clocks will run independently if they lose the master signal, often with a warning light lit. Others will freeze until the connection is restored.
