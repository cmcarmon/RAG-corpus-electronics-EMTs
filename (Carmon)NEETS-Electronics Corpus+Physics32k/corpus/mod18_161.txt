No single radar system has yet been designed that can perform all of the many radar functions
required by the military. Some of the newer systems combine several functions that formerly required
individual radar systems, but no single system can fulfill all the requirements of modern warfare. As a
result, modern warships, aircraft, and shore stations usually have several radar systems, each performing a
different function.
