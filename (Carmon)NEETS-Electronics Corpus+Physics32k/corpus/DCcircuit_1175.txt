Letter codes like these are only used for general-purpose wires such as those used in house-
holds and businesses. For high-power applications and/or severe service conditions, the com-
plexity of conductor technology deﬁes classiﬁcation according to a few letter codes. Overhead
power line conductors are typically bare metal, suspended from towers by glass, porcelain, or
ceramic mounts known as insulators. Even so, the actual construction of the wire to with-
stand physical forces both static (dead weight) and dynamic (wind) loading can be complex,
with multiple layers and different types of metals wound together to form a single conductor.
Large, underground power conductors are sometimes insulated by paper, then enclosed in a
steel pipe ﬁlled with pressurized nitrogen or oil to prevent water intrusion. Such conductors
require support equipment to maintain ﬂuid pressure throughout the pipe.
