Telemetry,  or  measurement  at  a  distance,  takes  many  and  varied  forms.  It  may  use  the  principles  of  radio,
electricity, optics, mechanics, or hydraulics to convey measurements made at one place to indicators, actuators,
recorders, or computers at another. By far the most popular telemetry systems are electrical and use radio or
wire links to convey information. In this respect, all of the considerations in the foregoing chapters on com-
munications  apply,  as  well  as  considerations  of  antennas,  power  supplies  and  convertors,  heat  removal,  and
radio frequency interference. Additional considerations that are unique to telemetry are treated here.
