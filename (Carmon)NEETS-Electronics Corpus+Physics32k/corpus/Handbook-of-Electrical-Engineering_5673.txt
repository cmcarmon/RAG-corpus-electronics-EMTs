Typical  planned  minimum  voltage  criteria  shown  in  Table 61.7  for  EHV  (345  kV  and  higher)  substations
and  for  generator  substations  are  selected  to  maintain  adequate  voltage  levels  at  interconnections,  at  power
plant auxiliary buses, and on the lower-voltage transmission systems. Typical planned minimum voltage criteria
for lower HV (such as 138 kV, 230 kV) transmission substations vary from 95 to 97.5% of nominal voltage
under normal system conditions to as low as 92.5% of nominal under double-contingency outages.
