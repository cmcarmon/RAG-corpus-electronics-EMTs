The ARMSTRONG OSCILLATOR is used to produce a sine-wave output of constant amplitude and 
of fairly constant frequency within the rf range. It is generally used as a local oscillator in receivers, as a 
source in signal generators, and as a radio-frequency oscillator in the medium- and high-frequency range.
