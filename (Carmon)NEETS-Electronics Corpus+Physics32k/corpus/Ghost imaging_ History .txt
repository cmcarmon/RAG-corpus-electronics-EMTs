The first demonstrations of ghost imaging were based on the quantum nature of light. Specifically, quantum correlations between photon pairs were used to build up an image. One of the photons of the pair strikes the object and then the bucket detector while the other follows a different path to a (multi-pixel) camera. The camera is constructed to only record pixels from photons that hit both the bucket detector and the camera's image plane.
Later experiments indicated that the correlations between the light beam that hits the camera and the beam that hits the object may be explained by purely classical physics. If quantum correlations are present, the signal-to-noise ratio of the reconstructed image can be improved. In 2009 'pseudothermal ghost imaging' and 'ghost diffraction' were demonstrated by implementing the 'computational ghost-imaging' scheme, which relaxed the need to evoke quantum correlations arguments for the pseudothermal source case.
Recently, it was shown that the principles of 'Compressed-Sensing' can be directly utilized to reduce the number of measurements required for image reconstruction in ghost imaging. This technique allows an N pixel image to be produced with far less than N measurements and may have applications in LIDAR and microscopy.
