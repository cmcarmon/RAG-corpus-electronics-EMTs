We begin with the motion of the bullet-pendulum system from the instant the pendulum is struck by the bullet.
Given



g


{\displaystyle g}
, the acceleration due to gravity, and



h


{\displaystyle h}
, the final height of the pendulum, it is possible to calculate the initial velocity of the bullet-pendulum system using conservation of mechanical energy (kinetic energy + potential energy). Let this initial velocity be denoted by




v

1




{\displaystyle v_{1}}
. Suppose the masses of the bullet and pendulum are




m

b




{\displaystyle m_{b}}
and




m

p




{\displaystyle m_{p}}
respectively.

Taking the initial height of the pendulum as the potential energy reference

, the final potential energy when the bullet-pendulum system comes to a stop

{\displaystyle (K_{final}=0)}
is given by

{\displaystyle U_{final}=(m_{b}+m_{p})\cdot g\cdot h}

{\displaystyle v_{1}={\sqrt {2\cdot g\cdot h}}}

We can now use momentum conservation for the bullet-pendulum system to get the speed of the bullet,




v

{\displaystyle v_{0}}
, before it struck the pendulum. Equating the momentum of the bullet before it is fired to that of the bullet-pendulum system as soon as the bullet strikes the pendulum (and using
