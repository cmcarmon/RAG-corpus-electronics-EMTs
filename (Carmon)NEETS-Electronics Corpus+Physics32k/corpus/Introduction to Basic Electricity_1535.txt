called a voltage rise (Figure 12-23). The voltage is con-
nected to the circuit so that the current flows from the 
negative terminal of the voltage source and returns to 
the positive terminal of the voltage source. A 12-volt 
battery connected to a circuit gives a voltage rise of  
12 volts to the circuit.
