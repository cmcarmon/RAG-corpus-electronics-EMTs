Messages are routed in networks of C104s using interval routing. In a network where each destination is uniquely numbered, interval routing associates non-overlapping, contiguous ranges of destinations with each output link. An output link for a packet is chosen by comparing the destination (contained in the packet's header) to each interval and choosing the one that contains the destination. The benefits of interval routing are that it is sufficient to provide deterministic routing on a range of network topologies and that can be implemented simply with a table-based lookup, so it delivers routing decisions with low latency. Interval routing can be used to implement efficient routing strategies for many classes of regular network topology.
In some networks, multiple links will connect to the same STC104 or processor endpoint, or to a set of equivalent devices. In this circumstance, the STC104 provides a mechanism for grouped adaptive routing, where bundles of links can share the same interval and a link is chosen adaptively from a bundle based on its availability. This mechanism makes efficient use of the available link bandwidth by ensuring a packet does not wait for a link while another equivalent one is available.
An additional ability of interval routing is to partition the network into independent sub networks. This can be used to prevent deadlock or to separate high-priority traffic to travel without contention.
