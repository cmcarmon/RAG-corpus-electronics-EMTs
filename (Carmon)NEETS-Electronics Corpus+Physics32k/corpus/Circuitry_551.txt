Next,  return  to  the  main  IDE,  select  Tools  and 
Simulation  Log  Viewer  and  then  Rate  and  Slow. 
Finally, select Simulation and Start (or press the F1 
key). You will see the program instructions and the 
contents  of  the  Z80’s  registers  displayed  as  the 
program  is  executed  (see  Fig.  11.17).  If  you  have 
left  the  Peripheral  Devices  window  open  you  will 
also  be  able  to  change  the  switch  settings  and 
observe the effect that this has. Finally, you should 
set  all  of  the  switches  to  the  ‘off’  position  and 
check  that  the  program  exits  from  the  loop  and 
reaches the HALT instruction.  
 
A further program 
 
If  you  have  been  able  to  run  the  simple  program 
successfully  you  might  like  to  try  your  hand  at 
developing  your  own  assembly  language  program 
using some of the assembly language  instructions 
shown in Table 11.4. This program should shift the 
bits on output Port 82H to the left by the number of 
places  indicated  by  data  from  Port  80H.  The  two 
ports can be preset before running the program.
