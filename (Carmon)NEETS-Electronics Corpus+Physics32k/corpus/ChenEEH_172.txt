Before closing this section, we provide a general network
for low-pass ﬁlters described by Formula 4.30. The elements
are like those in Figure 4.19. Depending on the order of
the ﬁlter, the last element before the load resistor will be
either an inductor in series or a capacitor in parallel. We
can have ﬁlters with different values of the resistors and
also a design with only one resistor, RL, but that does not
change the general structure of the ﬁlter. Table 4.2 gives
element values
for normalized Butterworth ﬁlters with
RE ¼ RL ¼ 1.
