Lee G. Sobotka from Washington University was awarded the status of Fellow in the American Physical Society, after he was nominated by their Division of Nuclear Physics in 2009, for his contributions to the understanding of complex nuclear reactions, most notably the production of intermediate mass fragments, and for the creation of novel detector systems and signal processing technologies for both basic and applied nuclear science.
