of the vector is the magnitude of the phasor, and the direction
is the phase angle. The projection of the vector on the x-axis is
the real part of the phasor, and the projection on the y-axis is
the imaginary part of the phasor in rectangular form as noted
in Figure 1.27. The graphical representation is called the pha-
sor diagram and the vector is called the phasor.
