Satellite Access Protocols
The multiple satellite access protocol is one of the most critical elements to the performance of a VSAT network.
VSAT systems tend to be used in applications where message delay is critical and this protocol is the controlling
element to the delay-throughput performance of the system. During the past 15 years, there have been numerous
multiple-access  protocols  developed  and  simulated  in  the  context  of  satellite  packet  communications  [Ray-
chaudhuri and Joseph, 1988]. Table 102.4 provides a comparison of throughput vs. delay for various satellite
access protocols.
