If a path for electron flow is provided between the ends of the conductor, electrons will leave the
negative end and flow to the positive end. This condition is shown in part view D. Electron flow will
continue as long as the emf exists. In studying figure 1-24, it should be noted that the induced emf could
also have been created by holding the conductor stationary and moving the magnetic field back and forth.
