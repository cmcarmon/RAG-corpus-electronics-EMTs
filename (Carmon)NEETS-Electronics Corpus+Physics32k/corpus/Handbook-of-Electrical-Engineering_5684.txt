Value-Based Transmission Planning
Recently some utilities have begun to use a value-of-service concept in transmission planning [EPRI, 1986].
This concept establishes a method of assigning a dollar value to various levels of reliability in order to balance
reliability and cost. For each particular outage, the amount and dollar value of unserved energy are determined.
Dollar  value  of  unserved  energy  is  based  on  rate  surveys  of  various  types  of  customers.  If  the  cost  of  the
transmission project required to eliminate the outage exceeds the value of service, then that project is given a
lower priority. As such, reliability is quantiﬁed, and beneﬁt-to-cost ratios are used to compare and prioritize
planning options.
