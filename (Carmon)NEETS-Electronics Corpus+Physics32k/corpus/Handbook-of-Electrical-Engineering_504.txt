Chebyshev Filters
The amount of ripple can be speciﬁed as desired, so that only a selective sample can be given here. We will use
0.1 dB, 0.25 dB, and 0.5 dB. All cut-off frequencies (end of ripple for the Chebyshev function) are at 1 rad/s.
Since the maximum power transfer condition precludes the existence of an equally terminated even-order ﬁlter,
only  odd  orders  are  given  for  the  doubly  terminated  case.  Figure  4.6  gives  the  singly  terminated  Chebyshev
ﬁlters for n = 2, 3, 4, and 5 and Fig. 4.7 gives the doubly terminated Chebyshev ﬁlters for n = 3 and n = 5.
