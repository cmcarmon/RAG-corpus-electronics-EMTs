There are today two major classes of PLDs—those based on the programmable logic array (PLA) and ﬁeld-
programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). PLA technology is the oldest and is now restricted to the less complex
circuits. FPGAs, on the other hand, are a more recent technology and are able to implement complex systems
equivalent to networks of several thousand logic gates. The ﬁrst part of this section will explain the principles
of  PLA-based  PLDs;  the  second  will  introduce  the  concepts  of  FPGAs.  A  ﬁnal  section  will  brieﬂy  cover  the
requirements of computer-aided design for programmable logic.
