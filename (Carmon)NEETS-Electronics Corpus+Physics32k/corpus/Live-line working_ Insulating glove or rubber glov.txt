Usually applied for work above 1kV ac 1.5kV dc The primary classes are: Class 1 - phase to phase working voltage 7.5kV Class 2 - phase to phase working voltage 17kV Class 3 - phase to phase working voltage 26.5kV Class 4 - phase to phase working voltage 36kV
Gloves protect the worker from exposure to the live part being worked upon sometimes referred to as the 1st point of contact; the point where current would enter the body should an inadvertent contact be made. Covers of insulating material such as blankets and linehose are employed in rubber glove working to protect the worker from exposure to a part at a different potential sometimes referred to as the 2nd point of contact; the point where current would leave the body should an inadvertent contact be made.
