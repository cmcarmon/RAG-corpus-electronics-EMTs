Figure 71.7 shows the loss characteristics of single-mode silica ﬁbers at the wavelengths of lowest attenuation.
As indicated in the ﬁgure, there are three possible windows of operation. In the ﬁrst window (around 820 nm),
the loss is typically 3 dB/km. This is too high for long systems. In the second window (near 1300 nm), the loss
is  about  0.5  dB/km.  In  addition,  the  ﬁber  bandwidth  is  quite  high  because  of  low  pulse  dispersion  at  this
wavelength. The second window is a reasonable operating wavelength for high-capacity, long-distance systems.
At 1550 nm (the third window) the loss is lowest, about 0.25 dB/km. This characteristic makes 1550 nm the
optimum choice for the very longest links.
