If you’re measuring the resistance of an individual component, take it out 
of the circuit before you test it. If you test a resistor when it’s wired into a 
circuit, you’ll get the equivalent resistance between two points, which is not 
necessarily the resistance of just your resistor. (See Chapter 5 for more on 
equivalent resistance.)
