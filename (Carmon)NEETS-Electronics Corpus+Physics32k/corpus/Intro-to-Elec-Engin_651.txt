Zener Diodes
Most diodes are not intended to be operated in the reverse breakdown region [see Figure 7.2.4(a)].
Diodes designed expressly to operate in the breakdown region are called zener diodes. A nearly
constant voltage in the breakdown region is obtained for a large range of reverse current through
the control of semiconductor processes. The principal operating region for a zener diode is the
negative of that for a regular diode in terms of both voltage and current. Zener diodes are employed
in circuits for establishing reference voltages and for maintaining a constant voltage for a load in
regulator circuits. Figure 7.2.7 shows the device symbol along with the linearized iâ€“v curve and
the circuit model.
