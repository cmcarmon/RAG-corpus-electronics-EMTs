The maximum speed limit found on highways in Ohio is 70 miles per hour (110 km/h) on the Ohio Turnpike, Rural Freeways, and both the Expressway and Freeway portions of US 30 from Mansfield, Ohio to the Indiana State Line and US 33 from Wapakoneta to St. Mary's Ohio. The speed limit ranges from 55 miles per hour (89 km/h) to 70 miles per hour (110 km/h) on other divided highways. A small portion of the westbound lane (less than 500 feet) of State Route 16 in Licking County is signed at 70 MPH slightly before the route upgrades from a two-lane non-divided to a four-lane divided highway, but otherwise, no non-divided highway in the state currently has a speed limit higher than 55 miles per hour (89 km/h), though ODOT is now permitted to increase undivided roads to 60 miles per hour (97 km/h).
Ohio is the only state east of the Mississippi River to allow 70 mph speed limits on non freeway roads. Both divided and non divided roads.
Ohio has an urban speed limit of 65 miles per hour (105 km/h) on Interstates by state law, yet many urban areas have lower speed limits due to safety concerns found in speed studies. These commonly are in the 50â€“60 mph range. For instance, in most of metro Dayton and Cincinnati, as well as in downtown Columbus, the speed limit is 55 miles per hour (89 km/h), while in Cleveland, Toledo, and Akron the speed limit is 60 miles per hour (97 km/h); however, in central Cleveland along the Inner Belt, the speed limit is 50 miles per hour (80 km/h). On one case, however, the Ohio Turnpike has a 70 miles per hour (110 km/h) in the outer suburbs of Toledo, Akron, and Cleveland, even since all 241 miles of the highway has the 70 mph speed limit. Some urban areas are also posted with minimum speed limits, usually with a minimum of 40 or 45. At one time, portions of Interstate 76 and Interstate 77 in downtown Akron had a maximum speed limit of 50 mph and a minimum speed limit of 35 mph.
School zones in Ohio normally have a 20 mph speed limit, regardless of the road's normal speed limit, in effect during school hours.
