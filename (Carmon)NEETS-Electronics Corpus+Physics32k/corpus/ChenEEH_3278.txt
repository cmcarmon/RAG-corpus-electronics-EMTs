Now consider a three-phase transmission line again with
each line spaced equally by the distance D. Superposition
holds so that the voltage arising from each of the charges can
be added. To ﬁnd the voltage from phase to ground arising
from each of the conductors, assume a balanced system with
qa þ qb þ qc ¼ 0 and a neutral system located at some far
distance R from phase a:
