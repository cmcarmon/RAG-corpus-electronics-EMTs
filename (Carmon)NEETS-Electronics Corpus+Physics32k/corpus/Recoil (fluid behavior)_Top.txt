Recoil is a rheological phenomenon observed only in non-Newtonian fluids that is characterized by a moving fluid’s ability to snap back to a previous position when external forces are removed. Recoil is a result of the fluid’s elasticity and memory where the speed and acceleration by which the fluid moves depends on the molecular structure and the location to which it returns depends on the conformational entropy. This effect is observed in numerous non-Newtonian liquids to a small degree, but is prominent in some materials such as molten polymers.
