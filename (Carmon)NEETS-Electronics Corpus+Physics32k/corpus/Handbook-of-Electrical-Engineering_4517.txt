This analytical formulation leads to an integral operator, whose kernel can include differential operators as
well,  which  acts  on  the  unknown  source  or  Ô¨Åeld. Although  it  would  be  more  accurate  to  refer  to  this  as  an
integrodifferential  equation,  it  is  usually  called  simply  an  integral  equation.  Two  general  kinds  of  integral
equations are obtained. In the frequency domain, representative forms for a perfect electric conductor are
