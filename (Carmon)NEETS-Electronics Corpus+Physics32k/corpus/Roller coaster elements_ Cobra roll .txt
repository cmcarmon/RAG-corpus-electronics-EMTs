The cobra roll is a roller coaster inversion which resembles a cobra's head. Riders traverse forward through an upwards half-vertical loop, corkscrew perpendicular to the first direction, enter another corkscrew that merges into a downward half-vertical loop that exits in the parallel but opposite direction of the entrance. It takes riders upside-down twice.
There is much confusion pertaining to the correct naming of this inversion. This is because different roller coaster manufacturers give their own names to inversions. Cobra roll is the standard name used by Intamin and B&M for this type of inversion.
The first coaster model to use a cobra roll was Vekoma's Boomerang model. The first of which, called Sea Serpent, was installed at Morey's Piers in Wildwood, New Jersey in the year 1984. All Vekoma Boomerangs, Tornado at Särkänniemi in Tampere, Huracan at Belantis in Leipzig, and almost all B&M 7-inversion coasters have cobra rolls.
