Positive feedback occurs when the feedback signal is in phase with the input signal. Figure 1-15 
shows a block diagram of an amplifier with positive feedback. Notice that the feedback signal is in phase 
with the input signal. This means that the feedback signal will add to or "regenerate" the input signal. The 
result is a larger amplitude output signal than would occur without the feedback. This type of feedback is 
what causes the public address system to squeal as described above.
