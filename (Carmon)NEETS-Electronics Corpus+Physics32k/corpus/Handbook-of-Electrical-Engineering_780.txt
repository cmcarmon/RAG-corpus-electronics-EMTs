The magnitude function of the n-pole Butterworth ﬁlter has a monotone characteristic in both the passband
and  stopband  of  the  ﬁlter.  Here  monotone means  that  the  magnitude  curve  is  gradually  decreasing  over  the
passband and stopband. In contrast to the Butterworth ﬁlter, the magnitude function of a type 1 Chebyshev
ﬁlter has ripple in the passband and is monotone decreasing in the stopband (a type 2 Chebyshev ﬁlter has the
opposite  characteristic).  By  allowing  ripple  in  the  passband  or  stopband,  we  are  able  to  achieve  a  sharper
transition between the passband and stopband in comparison with the Butterworth ﬁlter.
