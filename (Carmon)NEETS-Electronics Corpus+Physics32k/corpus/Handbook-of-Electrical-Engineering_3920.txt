admittances, Y = G + jB, where the conductance serves to model the radiation from the ends of the line, and
the  susceptance  serves  to  model  the  effective  length  extension  of  the  line  (due  to  fringing  Ô¨Åelds).  Several
approximations are available for calculating the end admittances [James and Hall, 1989], with a typical result
for d << l0 given as
