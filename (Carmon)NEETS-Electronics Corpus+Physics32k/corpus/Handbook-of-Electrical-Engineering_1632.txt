The problem is to ﬁnd an estimate of the parameter vector qm based on the realization of X(t). (Note that
the dimensionality of the parameter vector qm in the joint probability density function is assumed to be ﬁxed.)
The intuition behind the maximum likelihood method is that we choose those parameters [q1, …, qm] from
which the actually observed sample vector is most likely to have come. This means that the estimator of qm is
selected so that the observed sample vector becomes as “likely as possible.”
