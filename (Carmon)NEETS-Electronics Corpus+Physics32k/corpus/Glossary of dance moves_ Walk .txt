The Walk is probably the most basic dance move. It exists in almost every dance. Walks approximately correspond normal walking steps, taking into the account the basic technique of the dance in question. (For example, in Latin dance walks the toe hits the floor first, rather than the heel.)
In dance descriptions the term walk is usually applied when two or more steps are taken in the same direction. A single step, e.g., forward, is called just thus: 'step forward'.
Walks can be done in various dance positions: in = Curved walks are done along a curve, rather than along a straight line.
You can also just move forwards with your feet
