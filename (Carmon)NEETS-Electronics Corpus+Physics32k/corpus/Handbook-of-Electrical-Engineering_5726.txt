Transients
Voltage disturbances shorter than sags or swells are classiÔ¨Åed as transients and are caused by sudden changes
in  the  power  system  [Greenwood,  1971].  They  can  be  impulsive,  generally  caused  by  lightning  and  load
switching, and oscillatory, usually due to capacitor-bank switching.
