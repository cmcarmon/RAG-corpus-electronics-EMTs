A lumped electrical element is a model of an electrical device
with two or more terminals through which current can ﬂow in
or out; the ﬂow can pass only through the terminals. In a two-
terminal element, current ﬂows through the element entering
via one terminal and leaving via another terminal. On the
other hand, the voltage is present across the element and
measured between the two terminals. In a multiterminal ele-
ment, current ﬂows through one set of terminals and leaves
through the remaining set of terminals. The relation between
the voltage and current in an element, known as the v–i
