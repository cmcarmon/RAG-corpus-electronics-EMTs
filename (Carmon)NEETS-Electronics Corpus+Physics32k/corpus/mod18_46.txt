This second plane is called the VERTICAL PLANE. The radar location is the center of this
coordinate system. The line from the radar set directly to the object is referred to as the LINE OF SIGHT
(los). The length of this line is called RANGE. The angle between the horizontal plane and the los is the
ELEVATION ANGLE. The angle measured clockwise from true north in the horizontal plane is called
the TRUE BEARING or AZIMUTH angle. These three coordinates of range, bearing, and elevation
describe the location of an object with respect to the antenna.
