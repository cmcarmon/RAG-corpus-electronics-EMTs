Microprogramming is usually located in read-only memory
(ROM), directly controls physical devices, and provides a
cleaner interface to the machine language. It is actually an
interpreter, fetching the machine language instruction, such
as ADD, MOVE, and JUMP, and carrying the instruction out
as a series of little steps. To carry out an ADD instruction,
for example, the microprogram must determine where the
numbers to be added are located, fetch them, add them, and
store the result somewhere. The set of instructions that the
microprogram interprets deÔ¨Ånes the machine language, which
