Normally, the thin piece of fuse wire is contained within a safety sheath to minimize haz-
ards of arc blast if the wire burns open with violent force, as can happen in the case of severe
overcurrents. In the case of small automotive fuses, the sheath is transparent so that the
fusible element can be visually inspected. Residential wiring used to commonly employ screw-
in fuses with glass bodies and a thin, narrow metal foil strip in the middle. A photograph
showing both types of fuses is shown here:
