The movable coil of the D'Arsonval meter movement we have been discussing up to now uses small-
size wire in its windings. This small-size wire places limits on the amount of current that can be safely
passed through the coil. Therefore, the basic D'Arsonval movement discussed can be used to indicate or
measure only very small currents. Certain circuit changes must be made to the basic D'Arsonval meter
movement for it to be practical in everyday use. To measure large currents, you must use a SHUNT with
the meter.
