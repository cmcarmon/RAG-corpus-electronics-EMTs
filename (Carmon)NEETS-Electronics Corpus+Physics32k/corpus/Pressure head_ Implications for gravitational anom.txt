We would normally use pressure head calculations in areas in which



g


{\displaystyle g}
is constant. However, if the gravitational field fluctuates, we can prove that pressure head fluctuates with it.
If we consider what would happen if gravity decreases, we would expect the fluid in the venturi meter shown above to withdraw from the pipe up into the vertical columns. Pressure head is increased.
In the case of weightlessness, the pressure head approaches infinity. Fluid in the pipe may "leak out" of the top of the vertical columns (assuming



p
>
0


{\displaystyle p>0}
).
To simulate negative gravity, we could turn the venturi meter shown above upside down. In this case gravity is negative, and we would expect the fluid in the pipe to "pour out" the vertical columns. Pressure head is negative (assuming



p
>
0


{\displaystyle p>0}
).
If



p
<
0


{\displaystyle p<0}
and



g
>
0


{\displaystyle g>0}
, we observe that the pressure head is also negative, and the ambient air is sucked into the columns shown in the venturi meter above. This is called a siphon, and is caused by a partial vacuum inside the vertical columns. In many venturis, the column on the left has fluid in it (



ψ
>
0


{\displaystyle \psi >0}
), while only the column on the right is a siphon (



ψ
<
0


{\displaystyle \psi <0}
).
If



p
<
0


{\displaystyle p<0}
and



g
<
0


{\displaystyle g<0}
, we observe that the pressure head is again positive, predicting that the venturi meter shown above would look the same, only upside down. In this situation, gravity causes the working fluid to plug the siphon holes, but the fluid does not leak out because the ambient pressure is greater than the pressure in the pipe.
The above situations imply that the Bernoulli equation, from which we obtain static pressure head, is extremely versatile.
