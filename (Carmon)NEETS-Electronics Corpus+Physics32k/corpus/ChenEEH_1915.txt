REMOD Operation
The main idea behind REMOD is to assign a cover v to each
cell u of the circuit, where the cover is a functionally identical
cell that checks the computation of u after both have ﬁnished
their original computations. The original computation of a
cell is the computation it performs in the non-FT circuit. All
inputs to cell u are transmitted to its cover v after some delay
that depends on the delay of the cells. After cell v repeats u’s
original computation (called v’s checking computation), the
corresponding outputs of this computation are compared to
the original outputs of u. A mismatch indicates a fault in either
u or v, and a diagnostic routine can determine which of the
two is actually faulty. REMOD circuits are then reconﬁgured
around the faulty cell to resume normal operation.
