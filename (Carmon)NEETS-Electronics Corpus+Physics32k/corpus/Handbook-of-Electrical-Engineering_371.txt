The instantaneous power has a constant term and a sinusoidal term at twice the frequency. The quantity in
brackets ﬂuctuates between a minimum value of cos(a – b) – 1 and a maximum value of cos(a – b) + 1. This
ﬂuctuation of power delivered to the load has certain disadvantages in some situations where the transmission
of power is the purpose of a system. An electric motor, for example, operates by receiving electric power and
transmitting mechanical (rotational) power at its shaft. If the electric power is delivered to the motor in spurts,
the  motor  is  likely  to  vibrate.  In  order  to  run  satisfactorily,  a  physically  larger  motor  will  be  needed,  with  a
larger shaft and ﬂywheel, to provide inertia than would be the case if the delivered power were constant.
