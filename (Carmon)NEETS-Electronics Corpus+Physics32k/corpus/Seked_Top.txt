Seked (or seqed) is an ancient Egyptian term describing the inclination of the triangular faces of a right pyramid. The system was based on the Egyptian's length measure known as the royal cubit. It was subdivided into seven palms, each of which was sub-divided into four digits. The inclination of measured slopes was therefore expressed as the number of horizontal palms and digits relative to each royal cubit rise.
This inclination. a form of our modern measure of "gradient", is thus a measure equivalent to our modern cotangent of the angle of slope.
The most famous example of a seked slope is of the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt built around 2,550 B.C.. Based on the modern surveys the slopes of the faces of this monument were a seked of 5 1/2, or 5 palms and 2 digits, equivalent to a slope of 51.84Â° from the horizontal in the modern 360 degree system.
