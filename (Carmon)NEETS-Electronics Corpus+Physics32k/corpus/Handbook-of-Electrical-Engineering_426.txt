However, it has been shown [Chan, 1969] that if the Maxwell k-tree approach is employed in solving a linear
network, the redundancy inherent either in the direct expansion of determinants or in the ï¬‚owgraph techniques
described above can be either completely eliminated for passive networks or greatly reduced for active networks.
This point and others will be illustrated in the following example.
