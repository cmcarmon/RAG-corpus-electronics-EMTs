Note that impedances in series are combined like resistances in series, whereas admittances in
parallel are combined like conductances in parallel. Series–parallel impedance/admittance com-
binations can be handled in the same way as series–parallel resistor/conductance combinations.
Notice that in the dc case when s = 0, the impedance of the capacitor 1/Cs tends to be inﬁnite,
signifying an open circuit, whereas the impedance of the inductor Ls becomes zero, signifying a
short circuit.
