The coupling constant of a plasma is given by the ratio of its average Coulomb-interaction energy to its average kinetic energyâ€”or how strongly the electric force of each atom holds the plasma together . Plasmas can therefore be categorized into weakly- and strongly-coupled plasmas depending upon the value of this ratio. Many of the typical classical plasmas, such as the plasma in the solar corona, are weakly coupled, while the plasma in a white dwarf star is an example of a strongly coupled plasma.
