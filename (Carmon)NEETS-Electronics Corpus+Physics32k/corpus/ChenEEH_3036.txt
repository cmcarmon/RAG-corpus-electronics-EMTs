The siting of generators at hydro dams and mine mouths
required the transmission of power over long distances to
population centers, and the economies of scale encouraged
larger power plants. The concentration of generation in a
limited number of locations required that alternate transmis-
sion paths be available between the generator locations and the
consumption areas. Thus, transmission developed as a meshed
network of lines so that the loss of a line did not disrupt the
ï¬‚ow of power to consumers.
