The Sethi advertising model or simply the Sethi model was developed by Suresh P. Sethi in 1981, and it describes the process of how sales evolve over time in response to advertising. The rate of change in sales depend on three effects: response to advertising that acts positively on the unsold portion of the market, the loss due to forgetting or possibly due to competitive factors that act negatively on the sold portion of the market, and a random effect that can go either way. The model and some extensions have been empirically tested and are widely used in the marketing literature.
