In addition to the insertion and return losses, the performance of a circulator is described by its isolation which
is its insertion loss in the undesired direction. An isolator is just a three-port circulator with one of the ports
terminated in a matched load as shown in the microstrip realization of Fig. 39.10(c). It is used in a transmission
line to pass power in one direction but not in the reverse direction. It is commonly used to protect the output
of equipment from high reï¬‚ected signals. The heart of isolators and circulators is the nonreciprocal element.
Electronic versions have been developed for MMICs. A four-port version is called a duplexer and is used in
radar systems and to separate the received and transmitted signals in a transceiver.
