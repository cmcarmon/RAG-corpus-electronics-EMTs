 schematic, the most important things to focus on are the connections because 
the positioning of components in a schematic diagram does not necessarily 
correspond to the physical layout of components in a constructed circuit. (In 
fact, for complex circuits, itâ€™s unlikely that the physical circuit layout reflects 
the positioning shown in the schematic. Complex circuits often require sepa-
rate layout diagrams, sometimes known as artwork.)
