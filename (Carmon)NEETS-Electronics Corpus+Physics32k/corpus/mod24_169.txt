As previously stated, attenuation is caused by absorption, scattering, and bending losses. Each
mechanism of loss is influenced by fiber-material properties and fiber structure. However, loss is also
present at fiber connections. Fiber connector, splice, and coupler losses are discussed in chapter 4. The
present discussion remains relative to optical fiber attenuation properties.
