Another type of semiconductor you should become familiar with is the metal oxide semiconductor
field-effect transistor (MOSFET), as shown in figures 2-19 and 2-20. You must be extremely careful
when working with MOSFETs because of their high degree of sensitivity to static voltages. As previously
mentioned in this chapter, the soldering iron should be grounded. A metal plate should be placed on the
workbench and grounded to the ship’s hull through a 250-kilohm to 1-megohm resistor. You should also
wear a bracelet with an attached ground strap and ground yourself to the ship’s hull through a 250-kilohm
to 1-megohm resistor. You should not allow a MOSFET to come into contact with your clothing, plastics,
or cellophane-type materials. A vacuum plunger (solder sucker) must not be used because of the high
electrostatic charges it can generate. Solder removal by wicking is recommended. It is also good practice
to wrap MOSFETs in metal foil when they are out of a circuit. To ensure MOSFET safety under test, use
a portable volt-ohm-milliammeter (vom) to make MOSFET resistance measurements. A vtvm must
never be used in testing MOSFETs. You must be aware that while you are testing a MOSFET, you are
grounded to the ship’s hull or station’s ground. Use of a vtvm would cause a definite safety hazard because
of the 115-volt, 60-hertz power input. When the resistance measurements are complete and the MOSFET
is properly stored, unground both the plate on the workbench and yourself. You will understand MOSFET
testing better if you visualize it as equivalent to a circuit using diodes and resistors, as shown in figures
2-21 and 2-22.
