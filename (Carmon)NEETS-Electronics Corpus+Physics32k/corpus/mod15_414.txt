Basically, a resolver is a transformer in which the secondary windings can be rotated with respect to
the primary windings. Consequently, the amount of magnetic coupling between the primary and the
secondary is variable. In the most common form, a resolver consists of a stator and a rotor, each having
two separate windings placed precisely at right angles to each other as shown in figure 4-6.
