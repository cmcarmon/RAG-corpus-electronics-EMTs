High-Frequency  Small-Signal  Equivalent  Circuit  Model  of  a  FET.  For  small-signal  operations,  the  signal
strength is not large enough to forward bias the gate-to-semiconductor diode; hence, no current will ﬂow from
the gate to either the drain or the source. Therefore, the gate-to-source and gate-to-drain series resistances, RGS
and  RGD,  can  be  neglected.  Also,  since  there  will  be  no  current  ﬂow  from  the  gate  to  the  channel,  the  gate
conductance, Gg, can also be neglected. Figure 22.29 illustrates the high-frequency small-signal equivalent circuit
model of a FET.
