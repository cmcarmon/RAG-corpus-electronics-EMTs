Exercise 5.22
(Solution on p. 193.)
What might be the source of these oscillations? To gain some insight, what is the length- 2N
discrete Fourier transform of a length-N pulse? The pulse emulates the rectangular window, and
certainly has edges. Compare your answer with the length-2N transform of a length-N Hanning
window.
