In solid materials there usually exist a valance band which is an energy region where
the states are ﬁlled or partially ﬁlled by valence electrons. The conduction band is deﬁned
to be the lowest unﬁlled energy band. So our three materials can be characterized by
their band structure. An insulator has the valence and conduction band well separated. A
