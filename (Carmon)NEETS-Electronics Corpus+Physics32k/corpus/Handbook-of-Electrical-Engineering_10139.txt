These systems are designed to operate with critical damping (z = 1) because an underdamped system (z < 1)
has fast response but results in an overshoot, whereas an overdamped system (z >  1) is too slow. However, this
is not always possible, because the damping ratio given by Eq. (101.7) depends on Beff and Jeff which vary during
the actual operation of the manipulator. Beff changes with age or repeated use of the manipulator. Jeff varies with
the payload. For example, the variation of Jeff for the Stanford manipulator under various loading conditions
is shown in Fig. 101.13. Jeff also varies with the conﬁguration of the manipulator during the actual operation.
So a compromise solution will be to design the controller such that z ‡ 1 throughout the intended operation.
The  undamped  natural  frequency wn  is  selected  to  be  no  more  than  half  the  resonance  frequency  of  the
robot  to  avoid  any  structural  damage  to  the  robot  [Paul, 1981].  These  resonances  are  possible  due  to  the
ﬂexibilities associated with the links of the robot and the shafts within the drive system, to name a few. These
are called unmodeled resonances because they are not explicitly included in the model. In our case, if Keff and
Jeff are the effective stiffness and the inertias of the joint, respectively, then the resonance frequency wr is given by
