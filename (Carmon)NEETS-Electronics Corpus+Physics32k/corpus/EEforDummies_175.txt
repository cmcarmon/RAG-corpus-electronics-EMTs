My measurements show that in my circuit, the battery pack is supplying 
6.4 volts, and that 4.7 volts are dropped across the resistor and 1.7 volts are 
dropped across the LED. It’s not a coincidence that the sum of the voltage 
drops across the resistor and the LED is equal to the voltage supplied by the 
battery pack:
