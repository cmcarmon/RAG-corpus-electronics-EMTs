The length of time between T0 and T1 (and T2 to T3 in the next cycle) is the pulse width, which 
depends mainly on the characteristics of the transformer and the point at which the transformer saturates. 
A transformer is chosen that will saturate at about 10 percent of the total circuit current. This ensures that 
the current increase is nearly linear. The transformer controls the pulse width because it controls the slope 
of collector current increase between points T0 and T1. Since TC = L รท R , the greater the L, the longer 
the TC. The longer the time constant, the slower the rate of current increase. When the rate of current 
increase is slow, the voltage across L1 is constant for a longer time. This primarily determines the pulse 
width.
