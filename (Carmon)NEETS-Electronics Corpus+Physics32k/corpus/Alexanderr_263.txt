The  op  amp  is  a  fundamental  building  block  in  modern  electronic
instrumentation.  It  is  used  extensively  in  many  devices,  along  with
resistors and other passive elements. Its numerous practical applications
include instrumentation ampliﬁers, digital-to-analog converters, analog
computers,  level  shifters,  ﬁlters,  calibration  circuits,  inverters,  sum-
mers,  integrators,  differentiators,  subtractors,  logarithmic  ampliﬁers,
comparators,  gyrators,  oscillators,  rectiﬁers,  regulators,  voltage-to-
current converters, current-to-voltage converters, and clippers. Some of
these we have already considered. We will consider two more applica-
tions  here:  the  digital-to-analog  converter  and  the  instrumentation
ampliﬁer.
