Before the invention of the transistor, vacuum tubes did all the switching 
and amplifying. In fact, the vacuum tube was widely regarded as the greatest 
marvel in electricity in the early 20th century. Then, Bardeen, Brattain, and 
Shockley showed the world that tiny semiconductor transistors could do the 
same job â€” only better (and for less money). The trio was awarded the 1956 
Nobel Prize in Physics for their invention of the transistor.
