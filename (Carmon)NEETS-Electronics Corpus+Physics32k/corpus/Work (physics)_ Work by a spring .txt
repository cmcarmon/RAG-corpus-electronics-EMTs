Consider a spring that exerts a horizontal force F = (−kx, 0, 0) that is proportional to its deflection in the x direction independent of how a body moves. The work of this spring on a body moving along the space with the curve X(t) = (x(t), y(t), z(t)), is calculated using its velocity, v = (vx, vy, vz), to obtain

{\displaystyle W=\int _{0}^{t}\mathbf {F} \cdot \mathbf {v} dt=-\int _{0}^{t}kxv_{x}dt=-{\frac {1}{2}}kx^{2}.}

For convenience, consider contact with the spring occurs at t = 0, then the integral of the product of the distance x and the x-velocity, xvx, is (1/2)x2. The velocity is not a factor here. The work is the product of the distance times the spring force, which is also dependent on distance; hence the x2 result.
