Equation 15.31 is in fact a general result. For any linear circuit in which the
feedback resistor is sampling the output node voltage (rather than the output
current), the Th√©venin equivalent output resistance with feedback is equal to the
output resistance without feedback, divided by a factor 1+ (loop gain), the same
factor involved in gain calculations and calculation of sensitivity to changes in
the gain constant A.
