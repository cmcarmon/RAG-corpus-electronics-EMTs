There are many applications of magnetostatics and even
a few industries that are almost wholly based upon it.
The magnetic recording and electric power industries both
apply principles
from magnetostatics. Other applications
include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Inan and Inan,
1999), magnetic brush applicators in electrophotography (laser
printers) (Schein, 1992), and aurora in the earthâ€™s atmosphere
(Paul et al., 1998), to name a few.
