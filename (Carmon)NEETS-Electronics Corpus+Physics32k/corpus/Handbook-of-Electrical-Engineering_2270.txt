pn-Junction Diode
A pn-diode is a semiconductor device having a p-region, a n-region, and a junction between the regions. Modern
planar  semiconductor  pn-junction  diodes  are  fabricated  by  diffusion  or  implantation  of  impurities  into  a
semiconductor.  An  n-type  semiconductor  has  a  relatively  large  density  of  free  electrons  to  conduct  electric
current, and the p-type semiconductor has a relatively large concentration of “free” holes to conduct electric
current. The pn-junction is formed during the fabrication process. There is a large concentration of holes in
the  p-semiconductor  and  a  large  concentration  of  electrons  in  the  n-semiconductor.  Because  of  their  large
concentration  gradients,  holes  and  electrons  start  to  diffuse  across  the  junction.  As  holes  move  across  the
junction, negative immobile charges (acceptors) are uncovered on the p side, and positive immobile charges
(donors) are uncovered on the n side due to the movement of electrons across the junction. When sufﬁcient
numbers of the immobile charges on both sides of the junction are uncovered, a potential energy barrier voltage
V0 is created by the uncovered acceptors and donors. This barrier voltage prevents further diffusion of holes
and  electrons  across  the  junction.  The  charge  distribution  of  acceptors  and  donors  establishes  an  opposing
