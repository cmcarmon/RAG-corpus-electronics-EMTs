note: Did you know that two kinds of inﬁnities can be meaningfully deﬁned? A countably
inﬁnite quantity means that it can be associated with a limiting process associated with integers.
An uncountably inﬁnite quantity cannot be so associated. The number of rational numbers is
countably inﬁnite (the numerator and denominator correspond to locating the rational by row and
column; the total number so-located can be counted, voila!); the number of irrational numbers is
uncountably inﬁnite. Guess which is “bigger?”
