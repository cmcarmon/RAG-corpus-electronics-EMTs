incorporated into the strike surface of each hammer. One design includes 33 hammers (each spaced 1 cm from
its neighbor) covering 132 character positions. With an oscillatory shuttle motion of 1 cm, all line dot positions
are covered, and the shuttle return time can be used for paper advance. Moderate printing speeds (600â€“900
lpm)  can  be  accomplished  with  1/4-cm  hammer  spacing;  300  lpm  is  possible  with  1-cm  spacing.  Opposite
moving counterweights have been employed to reduce shuttle vibration.
