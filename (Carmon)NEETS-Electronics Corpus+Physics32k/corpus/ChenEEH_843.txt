A sequence of connected logic gates (no registers) is called a
signal path. For example, in Figure 4.1, one signal path begins
at the register R1 and propagates through the logic gates G1
and G2 before reaching the register R3. Other signal paths can
also be identiﬁed in the system shown in Figure 4.1. Every
signal path in a synchronous system is delimited by a pair of
registers—one register each for the start and the end of the
path. Such a pair of registers is called a sequentially adjacent
pair and is deﬁned next:
Sequentially adjacent pair of registers: For
an arbitrary ordered pair of registers hRi, Rf i in a synchronous
circuit, one of the following two situations can be observed. Either
there exists at least one signal path that connects some output of
Ri to some input of Rf , or inputs of Rf cannot be reached from
outputs of Ri through a signal path.1 In the former case—
denoted by Ri ?Rf —the pair of registers hRi, Rf i is called a
sequentially adjacent pair of registers, and switching events at
the output of Ri can possibly affect the input of Rf during the
same clock period. A sequentially adjacent pair of registers is also
referred to as a local data path (Friedman, 1995).
