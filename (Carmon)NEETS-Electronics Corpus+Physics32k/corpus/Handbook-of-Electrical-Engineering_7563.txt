Now let either or both of the inputs be dropped to 0.2 V. T1 is then biased to saturation in the normal mode,
so the collector current of T1 extracts the charge from the base region of T2. With T2 cut off, the base of T4 is
at 0 V and T4 is cut off. T3 will be biased by the current through the 1.6-kW resistor (R3) to a degree regulated
by the current demand at the output C. The drop across R3 is quite small for light loads, so the output level at
C will be VCC – VBE3 – VD3, which will be about 3.5 V corresponding to the logical 1.
