In electronics, the term bias refers to a steady DC voltage or current applied to 
an electronic device or circuit to get it to operate a certain way. Devices such 
as transistors (which I cover in Chapter 10) and diodes are nonlinear devices. 
That is, the relationship between voltage and current in these devices is not 
constant; it varies across different ranges of voltages and current. Diodes and 
transistors are not like resistors, which exhibit a linear (constant) relationship 
between voltage and current.
