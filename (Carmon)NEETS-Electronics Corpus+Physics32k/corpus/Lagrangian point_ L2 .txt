{\displaystyle {\frac {M_{1}}{(R+r)^{2}}}+{\frac {M_{2}}{r^{2}}}={\frac {M_{1}}{R^{2}}}+{\frac {r\left(M_{1}+M_{2}\right)}{R^{3}}}}

with parameters defined as for the L1 case. Again, if the mass of the smaller object (M2) is much smaller than the mass of the larger object (M1) then L2 is at approximately the radius of the Hill sphere, given by:
