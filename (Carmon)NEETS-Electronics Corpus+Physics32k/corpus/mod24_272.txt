Single mode fiber cutoff wavelength is the smallest operating wavelength when single mode fibers
propagate only the fundamental mode. At this wavelength, the 2nd-order mode becomes lossy and
radiates out of the fiber core. As the operating wavelength becomes longer than the cutoff wavelength, the
fundamental mode becomes increasingly lossy. The higher the operating wavelength is above the cutoff
wavelength, the more power is transmitted through the fiber cladding. As the fundamental mode extends
into the cladding material, it becomes increasingly sensitive to bending loss. Single mode fiber designs
include claddings of sufficient thickness with low absorption and scattering properties to reduce
attenuation of the fundamental mode. To increase performance and reduce losses caused by fiber bending
and splicing, fiber manufacturers adjust the value of V. To adjust the value of V, they vary the core and
cladding sizes and relative refractive index difference ( D ).
