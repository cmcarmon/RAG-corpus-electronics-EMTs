In ordinary metals, interatomic distances are nearly constant through a wide range of temperatures and pressures; this is not the case with Rydberg matter, whose distances and thus properties vary greatly with excitations. A key variable in determining these properties is the principal quantum number n that can be any integer greater than 1; the highest values reported for it are around 100. Bond distance d in Rydberg matter is given by

{\displaystyle d=2.9n^{2}a_{0}\,}

where a0 is the Bohr radius. The approximate factor 2.9 was first experimentally determined, then measured with rotational spectroscopy in different clusters. Examples of d calculated this way, along with selected values of the density D, are given in the adjacent table.
