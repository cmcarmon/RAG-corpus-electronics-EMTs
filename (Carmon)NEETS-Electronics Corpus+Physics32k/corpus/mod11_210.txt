The desired frequency input signal is fed to port 1 of the circulator through a bandpass filter. The 
filter serves a dual purpose as a bandwidth selector and an impedance-matching device that improves the 
gain of the amplifiers. The input energy enters port 2 of the circulator and is amplified by the tunnel 
diode. The amplified energy is fed from port 2 to port 3 and on to the mixer. If any energy is reflected 
from port 3, it is passed to port 4, where it is absorbed by the matched load resistance.
