Intelligent falling (IF) is a parody of the intelligent design (ID) movement. It is a pseudoscientific supernatural explanation of the effects of gravity. The joke originated on Usenet, and has appeared in several online parodies. An article about Intelligent Falling in The Onion described free fall as being caused by "the hand of God".
