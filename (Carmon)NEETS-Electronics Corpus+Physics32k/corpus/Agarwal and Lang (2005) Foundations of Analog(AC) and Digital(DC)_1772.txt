The second complication is that vTH does not step to or from 0 V. Rather it falls from
5 V to 0.5 V for a falling transition, and rises from 0.5 V to 5 V for a rising transition.
Because the circuit in Figure 12.37 is linear, we can use the method of superposition to
decompose this problem into two simpler problems. Accordingly, we will break vTH into
two component voltage sources connected in series as shown in Figure 12.38. The first
component, ¯vTH, is constant at 0.5 V. The second component, ˜vTH, steps from 0 V to
4.5 V for a rising transition, and falls from 4.5 V to 0 V for a falling transition. The circuit
response to these two components may be superimposed to find the total response. We
will denote the vC response to ¯vTH by ¯vC, and we will denote the corresponding response
to ˜vTH by ˜vC. Similarly, we will denote the corresponding iL responses as ¯L and ˜L.
The circuit response to the constant ¯vTH is most easily determined by observing that
the capacitor and inductor in Figure 12.37, respectively, behave as an open circuit and a
