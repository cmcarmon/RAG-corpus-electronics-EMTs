Clutter returns are primarily from stationary or near-stationary surfaces such as terrain. In contrast, targets
of interest often have a signiﬁcant range rate relative to the radar clutter. Doppler ﬁltering can suppress returns
from clutter. With the exception of frequency ambiguity, the Doppler ﬁltering techniques used to implement
pulse Doppler ﬁltering are quite similar to those described for CW radar in Section 41.2. Ambiguous measure-
ments  can  be  resolved  over  multiple  CPIs  by using  a  sequence  of  slightly  different  PRFs  and  correlating
detections among the CPIs [Morris, 1988].
