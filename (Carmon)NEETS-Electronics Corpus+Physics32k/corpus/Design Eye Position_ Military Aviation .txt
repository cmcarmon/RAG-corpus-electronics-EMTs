With collimated displays, such of the cockpit Head Up Display, the projected symbology is aligned very precisely with the outside world to allow for precise delivery of weapons and also for safe landing. Unless located at the Design Eye Position the pilot cannot see the symbology as it is effectively focussed at infinity. Similarly, Head Down Displays will usually be angled precisely towards the DEP so that all symbols may be equally visible to the pilot without parallax or other display distortion errors.
Pilots who are below or above the 50% percentile point for sitting height, i.e. not of average stature, may need to adjust the seat in order to attain the DEP, even if this means compromising their optimal reach envelope. This is why, for example, rudder pedals may need to be adjustable.
