The resistance is the property of the bulb of interest to us. Likewise, the
voltage is the property of the battery that we most care about. Ignoring, for
now, any internal resistance of the battery, we can lump the battery into a
discrete element called by the same name supplying a constant voltage V, as
shown in Figure 1.4b. Again, we can do this if we work within certain con-
straints to be discussed shortly, and provided we are not concerned with the
internal properties of the battery, such as the distribution of the electrical field.
In fact, the electric field within a real-life battery is horrendously difficult to chart
accurately. Together, the collection of constraints that underlie the lumped cir-
cuit abstraction result in a marvelous simplification that allows us to focus on
specifically those properties that are relevant to us.
