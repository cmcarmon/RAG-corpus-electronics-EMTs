Miscellaneous Impairments
Laser chirp can cause problems with direct laser modulation. Chirp is modulation of the laser frequency caused
by modulation of the refractive index of the laser cavity in response to current modulation. The interaction of
chirp and chromatic dispersion in the ﬁber can cause unacceptable CSO levels for AM-VSB systems as short
as a few kilometers. Dispersion converts the FM into IM, which mixes with the signal IM to produce second-
order distortion [Phillips et al., 1991]. These systems must operate at wavelengths corresponding to low ﬁber
dispersion, or corrective measures must be taken.
