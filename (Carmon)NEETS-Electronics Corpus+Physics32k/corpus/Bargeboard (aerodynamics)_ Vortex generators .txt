Another important function of bargeboards is to act as vortex generators, redirecting and energizing airflow. The upper, downward sloping edge can shed a large vortex downstream around the sidepods, where it can interact favorably with flip-ups, or aid in sealing the low pressure underbody flow from the ambient stream. The bottom edge of the bargeboard can also shed vortices that energize the airflow to the underbody, which can help delay flow separation and allow the use of more aggressive diffuser profiles. In recent years, these two edges have acquired relatively large serrations or protruding tabs to enhance this aspect of their performance.
