Vertical Microinstructions
At the other extreme, if the microinstruction allows only the speciﬁcation of a single microcommand at a time,
the instruction is then called vertical. In that case, only the necessary commands for a particular program are
speciﬁed, resulting in smaller control memory requirements. However, it is not possible to take advantage of
possible parallelism offered by the hardware, since only one microcommand is executed at a time. For example,
the vertical speciﬁcation of an ALU operation is as follows:
