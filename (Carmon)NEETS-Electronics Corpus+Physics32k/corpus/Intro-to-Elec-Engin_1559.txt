15.2.16 The signal m(t), whose frequency spectrum M(f )
is shown in Figure P15.2.16, is to be transmitted
from one station to another. Let the signal be nor-
malized, i.e., −1 ≤ m(t ) ≤ 1. Find the bandwidth
of the modulated signal:
(a) If USSB (upper single sideband) is employed.
(b) If DSB (double sideband) is employed.
(c) If an AM modulation scheme with a modula-
