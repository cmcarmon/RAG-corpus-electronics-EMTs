Robins' original book had some omitted assumptions in the formula; for example, it did not include a correction to account for a bullet impact that did not match the center of mass of the pendulum. An updated formula, with this omission corrected, was published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society the following year. Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, unaware of this correction, independently corrected this omission in his annotated German translation of the book. The corrected formula, appearing in a 1786 edition of the book, was:




v

614.58
g

p

b

{\displaystyle v=614.58gc\cdot {\frac {p+b}{birn}}}

where:




v


{\displaystyle v}
is the velocity of the ball in units per second




b


{\displaystyle b}
is the mass of the ball




p


{\displaystyle p}
is the mass of the pendulum




g


{\displaystyle g}
is the distance from pivot to the center of gravity




i


{\displaystyle i}
is the distance from pivot to the point of the ball's impact




c


{\displaystyle c}
is the chord, as measured by the ribbon described in Robins' apparatus




r


{\displaystyle r}
is the radius, or distance from the pivot the attachment of the ribbon




n


{\displaystyle n}
is the number of oscillations made by the pendulum in one minute
Robins used feet for length and ounces for mass, though other units, such as inches or pounds, may be substituted as long as consistency is maintained.
