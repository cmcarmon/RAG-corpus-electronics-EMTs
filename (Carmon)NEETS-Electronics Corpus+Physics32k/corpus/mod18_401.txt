The timing circuits, shown in figure 2-31, are used to accurately control the transmitter pulse-
repetition frequency to ensure that the pulse-repetition time remains constant from pulse to pulse. This is
necessary, of course, for the pulses arriving at the comparison point to coincide in time and achieve
cancellation of fixed targets.
