Since the entire circuit comprises a battery and a resistor, we can state without a lot of
analysis that the resistor dissipates power and the battery supplies it. How much power
does the battery provide when it is connected to the 10- resistor? Suppose the battery
supplies a current I. We can quickly compute the value of this current as:
