The common collector ampliﬁer is also called the emitter follower ampliﬁer because the
output voltage signal at the emitter is approximately equal to the voltage signal input on
the base. The ampliﬁer’s voltage gain is always less than unity, but it has a large current
gain and is normally used to match a high-impedance source to a low-impedance load: the
ampliﬁer has a large input impedance and a small output impedance.
