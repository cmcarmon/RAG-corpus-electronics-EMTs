As the gate bias is increased further, the band bending
increases. The depletion region becomes wider, and the elec-
tron concentration in the inversion layer increases. When the
electron concentration is equal to the hole concentration in the
bulk, a strong inversion layer is said to form. The surface
potential required to achieve strong inversion is equal to:1
