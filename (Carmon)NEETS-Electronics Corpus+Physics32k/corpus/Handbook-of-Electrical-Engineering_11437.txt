Si:Li Type Silicon Detectors
As with germanium for gamma-ray spectroscopy, the impurity requirements on silicon for nuclear radiation
detectors are also stringently low and difﬁcult to obtain. Such silicon must be grown by the ﬂoat zone technique
to eliminate contamination from a crucible. Unlike germanium, little dedicated effort has been expended trying
to  improve  silicon  growth  techniques  to  achieve  superior  detector  characteristics.  Most  progress  in  material
quality has come from technology improvements aimed at other applications. The purest silicon commercially
available typically has a net electrically active impurity concentration of a few times 1011 cm–3 (compared to
1010 cm–3  for  HPGe),  which  usually  limits  device  thicknesses  to  less  than  a  millimeter.  When  thicker  silicon
devices are required, as in X-ray spectroscopy, silicon of higher net purity can be obtained by lithium drifting
[19], but such material cannot be subsequently processed above room temperature.
