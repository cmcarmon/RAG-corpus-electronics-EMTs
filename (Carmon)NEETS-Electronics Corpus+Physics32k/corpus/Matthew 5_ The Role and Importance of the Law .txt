Verse 17 - Jesus states that he has not come to "abolish the law" but to "fulfill" it.
Verse 18 - Jesus then declares the law to be valid until "Heaven and Earth pass away" and "all things are accomplished".
Verse 19 - Shows a direct correlation between the act of adhering to the Biblical Code, and the righteousness of the individual.
Verse 20 - Jesus identifies Greater Righteousness as a condition for inclusion in the Kingdom of Heaven.
The NIV translation entitles Matthew 5:17-20 "The Fulfillment of the Law", the NRSV translation entitles it "The Law and the Prophets", the United Bible Societies' "The Greek New Testament", edited by Kurt Aland, Bruce Metzger and others, entitles it the "Teaching about the Law."
This pericope is at the core of the argument about the relationship between the views attributed to Jesus, such as Gospel, Grace, New Covenant, New Commandment, Law of Christ, and those attributed to Moses or the Mosaic Law, and hence on the relationship between the New Testament and Old Testament, Christian views on the old covenant, Law and Gospel, and as a basis of Christian ethics.
The reason for this argument is a disagreement about the proper interpretation of the word "fulfillment" (πληρῶσαι; plerosai). This goes back at least as far as Marcion of Sinope and continues until today. Many modern scholars now consider these four verses to be a prelude to the Antitheses, but this position is not universally accepted, and many continue to interpret Matthew 5:17-20 independent of its textual neighbors.
