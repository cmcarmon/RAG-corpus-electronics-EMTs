By adding a suitable gravitational term to the standard model action with gravitational coupling, the theory develops a local conformal (Weyl) invariance in the unitary gauge for the local SU(2). The gauge is fixed by requiring the Higgs scalar to be a constant. This mechanism generates the masses for the vector bosons and matter fields with no physical degrees of freedom for the Higgs.
