Special Case 1
In branches where voltage sources are present, the v–i relation
cannot be used to ﬁnd the current. Instead, the current is left as
an unknown. Because the voltage of the element is known,
another equation can be used to solve the added unknown.
When the element is a current source, the current through the
element is known. There is no need to use the v–i relation. The
calculation is illustrated in the following example.
