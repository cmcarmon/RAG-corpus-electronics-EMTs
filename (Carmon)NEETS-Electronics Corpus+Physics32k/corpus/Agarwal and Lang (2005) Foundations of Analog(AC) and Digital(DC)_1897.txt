The preceding expression for vo(t) is actually the particular solution for an
excitation given by vi(t) = Vi cos(Ï‰t), and is the steady-state response of the
circuit for a cosine wave excitation. If we care to obtain the complete solution,
we must add in the homogeneous solution as illustrated in Equation 13.22.
