The Ô¨Årst region corresponds to wearin (infant mortality) or early failures during debugging. The hazard rate
goes down as debugging continues. The second region corresponds to an essentially constant and low failure
rate and failures can be considered to be nearly random. This is the useful lifetime of the component. The third
region corresponds to wearout or fatigue phase with a sharply increasing hazard rate.
