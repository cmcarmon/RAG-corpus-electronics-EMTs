increased hardware complexity. Indeed, this implementation requires hardware for the encoding and for the
selection of the partial products (0, –Y, –2Y). An optimized encoding is shown in Fig. 86.6.
Division Algorithm
Division is a more complex process to implement because, unlike multiplication, it involves guessing the digits
of the quotient. Here, we will consider an algorithm for division of two positive integers designated as dividend
Y and divisor X resulting in a quotient Q and an integer remainder Z according to the relation given by
