In quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the quantity Λ is called the QCD scale. The value is





Λ

M
S


=
218
±
24

MeV

.


{\displaystyle \Lambda _{MS}=218\pm 24{\text{ MeV}}.}

This value is to be used at a scale above the bottom quark mass of about 5 GeV. The meaning of ΛMS is given in the article on dimensional transmutation.
The proton-to-electron mass ratio is primarily determined by the QCD scale.
