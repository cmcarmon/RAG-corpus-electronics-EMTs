To get an idea of how a transistor works (specifically, a FET), think of a pipe 
connecting a source of water to a drain with a controllable valve across a sec-
tion of the pipe, as shown in Figure 10-5. By controlling whether the valve is 
fully closed, fully open, or partially open, you control the flow of water from 
the source to the drain.
