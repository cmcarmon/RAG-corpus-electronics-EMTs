If one treats l as a constant, then (113.9) describes the membrane response only during its sub-threshold
(linear) phase. For membrane depolarization approaching the threshold of excitation, membrane conductance
of ionic constituents becomes highly nonlinear, as noted above â€” it is this nonlinear behavior that leads to
nerve excitation.
