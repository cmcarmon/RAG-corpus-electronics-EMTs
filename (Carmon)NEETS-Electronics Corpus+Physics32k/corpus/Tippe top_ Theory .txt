It is usually assumed that the speed of the tippe top at the point of contact with the plane is zero (i.e. there is no slippage). However, as indicated by P. Contensou, this assumption does not lead to a correct physical description of the top's motion. The unusual behavior of the top can be fully described by considering dry friction forces at the contact point.
