Figure 3.37 depicts various kinds of transistors commercially avail-
able. There are two basic types of transistors: bipolar junction transis-
tors (BJTs)  and  ﬁeld-effect  transistors (FETs).  Here,  we  consider  only
the BJTs, which were the ﬁrst of the two and are still used today. Our
objective is to present enough detail about the BJT to enable us to apply
the techniques developed in this chapter to analyze dc transistor circuits.
