Publicly traded company Applied Energetics (formerly Ionatron) develops directed-energy weapons for the United States Military. The company has produced a device called the Joint IED Neutralizer (JIN) which was deemed unfit for field use in 2006. The JIN is intended for safely detonating improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Future designs include weapons mounted on land, air and sea vehicles and as a hand-held infantry version.
Applied Energetics said that the weapons will be able to be used as a non-lethal alternative to current weaponry, but will be able to deliver a high enough voltage jolt to kill.
Applied Energetics / Ionatron say that they are working on an electrolaser system, called LGE (Laser Guided Energy). They are also studying a laser-induced plasma channel (LIPC) as a way to stop people from going through a corridor or passageway.
