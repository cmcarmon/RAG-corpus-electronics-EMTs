1.2.15 With a direct current of I A, the power expended as
heat in a resistor of R is constant, independent of
time, and equal to I 2R. Consider Problem 1.2.14
and Ô¨Ånd in each case the effective value of the
current to give rise to the same heating effect as in
the ac case, thereby justifying that the rms value
is also known as the effective value for periodic
waveforms.
