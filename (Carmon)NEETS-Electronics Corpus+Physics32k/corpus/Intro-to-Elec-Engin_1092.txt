The torque-angle characteristic curve of a cylindrical-rotor synchronous machine is shown
in Figure 13.1.3 as a function of the angle δr. For δr < 0, Te > 0, the developed torque is positive
and acts in the direction of the rotation; the machine operates as a motor. If, on the other hand,
the machine is driven by a prime mover so that δr becomes positive, the torque is then negative,
and the machine operates as a generator. Note that at standstill, i.e., when ωm = 0, no average
unidirectional torque is developed by the synchronous machine. Such a synchronous motor is not
capable of self-starting because it has no starting torque. The designer must provide a method for
bringing the machine up to synchronous speed.
