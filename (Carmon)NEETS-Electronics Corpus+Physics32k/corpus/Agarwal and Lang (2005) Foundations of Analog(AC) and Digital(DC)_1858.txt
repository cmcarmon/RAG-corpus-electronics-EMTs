(13.18)
From the perspective of Figure 13.3, we have calculated in Equation 13.18
the response ˜vcp, and what we really want is vcp1. Notice that vcp1 is none other
than the vcp that we had originally set out to find, namely, the solution to Equa-
tion 13.6. So we want to ‘‘de-superimpose’’ the two sources in Figure 13.4a.
This is a simple matter because of the j flag: vcp1 is the real part of
