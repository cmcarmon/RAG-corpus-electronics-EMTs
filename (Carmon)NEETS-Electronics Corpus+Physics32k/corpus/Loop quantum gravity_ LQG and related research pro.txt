Several research groups have attempted to combine LQG with other research programs: Johannes Aastrup, Jesper M. Grimstrup et al. research combines noncommutative geometry with canonical quantum gravity and Ashtekar variables, Laurent Freidel, Simone Speziale, et al., spinors and twistor theory with loop quantum gravity, and Lee Smolin et al. with Verlinde entropic gravity and loop gravity. Stephon Alexander, Antonino Marciano and Lee Smolin have attempted to explain the origins of weak force chirality in terms of Ashketar's variables, which describe gravity as chiral, and LQG with Yangâ€“Mills theory fields in four dimensions. Sundance Bilson-Thompson, Hackett et al., has attempted to introduce standard model via LQG's degrees of freedom as an emergent property (by employing the idea noiseless subsystems a useful notion introduced in more general situation for constrained systems by Fotini Markopoulou-Kalamara et al.)
Furthermore, LQG has drawn philosophical comparisons with causal dynamical triangulation and asymptotically safe gravity, and the spinfoam with group field theory and AdS/CFT correspondence. Smolin and Wen have suggested combining LQG with String-net liquid, tensors, and Smolin and Fotini Markopoulou-Kalamara Quantum Graphity. There is the consistent discretizations approach. Also, Pullin and Gambini provide a framework to connect the path integral and canonical approaches to quantum gravity. They may help reconcile the spin foam and canonical loop representation approaches. Recent research by Chris Duston and Matilde Marcolli introduces topology change via topspin networks.
