Figure 16.1.5 shows a single-phase rectiﬁer circuit converting ac voltage into a ﬁxed dc
voltage. It can be extended to three-phase supply. Figure 16.1.6 shows a single-phase ac–dc
converter with two natural line-commutated thyristors. The average value of the output voltage
is controlled by varying the conduction time of the thyristors. Three-phase input can also be
converted.
