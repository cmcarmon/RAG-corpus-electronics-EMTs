An increase in the power output of an AM transmitter is indicated by an increase in antenna current. 
The increase can be taken as a measure of the degree of modulation and can be expressed as a percentage, 
as shown in figure 5-1. The graph for this figure was developed from the relationship existing between the 
carrier power and the increased power resulting from the added modulation power. The formula for 
calculating the PERCENTAGE of MODULATION is as follows:
