For level ground conditions, the total vertical stress at a point,




σ

v




{\displaystyle \sigma _{v}}
, on average, is the weight of everything above that point per unit area. The vertical stress beneath a uniform surface layer with density



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
, and thickness



H


{\displaystyle H}
is for example:





σ

v


=
ρ
g
H
=
γ
H


{\displaystyle \sigma _{v}=\rho gH=\gamma H}

where



g


{\displaystyle g}
is the acceleration due to gravity, and



γ


{\displaystyle \gamma }
is the unit weight of the overlying layer. If there are multiple layers of soil or water above the point of interest, the vertical stress may be calculated by summing the product of the unit weight and thickness of all of the overlying layers. Total stress increases with increasing depth in proportion to the density of the overlying soil.
It is not possible to calculate the horizontal total stress in this way. Lateral earth pressures are addressed elsewhere.
