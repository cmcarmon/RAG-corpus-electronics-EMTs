In MKS units, I is in amps (A), V in volts (V), B in Tesla (T), and ᐉ, w, and d in meters (m). By realizing that
1 T = 1 V–s m–2, 1 A = 1 coulomb (C)/s, and 1 ohm (Ω) = 1 VA–1 then σ is in units of Ω–1m–1, RH in m3C–1,
H in m2V–1s–1, and nH in m–3. However, it is more common to denote σ in Ω–1cm–1, RH in cm3 C–1, µ
µ
H in cm2
V–1s–1, and nH in cm–3, with obvious conversion factors (1 m = 102 cm). Because B is often quoted in Gauss (G),
it is useful to note that 1 T = 104 G.
