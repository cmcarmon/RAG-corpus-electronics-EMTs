In these equations, VB¢E¢ is the internal base-emitter voltage, CjEO is the base-emitter junction capacitance at
VB¢E¢ = 0, fE is the base-emitter barrier potential, and mE is the base-emitter capacitance gradient factor. Similarly,
VB¢C¢ is the internal base-collector voltage, CjCO is the base-collector junction capacitance at VB¢C¢ = 0, fC is the
base-collector barrier potential, and mC is the base-collector capacitance gradient factor. ICC and IEC denote the
collector  and  emitter  reference  currents,  respectively,  while tF  is  the  total  forward  transit  time,  and tR  is  the
total reverse transit time. aR and aF are the large-signal reverse and forward current gains of a common base
transistor, respectively.
