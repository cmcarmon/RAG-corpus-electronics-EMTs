Although constant ﬁeld scaling provides a reasonable
guideline, scaling of the voltages by the same factor as the
physical dimensions is not always practical. This is due to the
inability to scale the subthreshold slope properly as well as
standardize voltage levels of prior generations. This is the basis
for constant voltage scaling and other modiﬁed scaling meth-
odologies. One problem with constant voltage scaling is that
the oxide ﬁeld increases since the tox is also scaled by k. To
reduce this problem, the oxide thickness is reduced by k0 where
k0 < k. Modiﬁcations of the constant voltage and constant
ﬁeld scaling have also been tried to avoid high-ﬁeld problems.
For example, in quasi-constant voltage scaling, physical di-
mensions are scaled by k, whereas the voltages are scaled by a
different factor, k0. Furthermore, since depletion layers do not
scale proportionately, the doping concentration, NA, must be
increased by more than what is suggested by constant-ﬁeld
scaling. This is called generalized scaling and the doping
scaling factor is greater than k. The scaling rules discussed
above are shown in Table 3.3.
