The barrels of several styles of larger size aluminum terminal lugs are filled with a petroleum 
abrasive compound. This compound causes a grinding action during the crimping operation. This 
removes the oxide film from the aluminum. It also prevents the oxide film from reforming in the 
connection. All aluminum terminals and splices have an inspection hole to allow checking the depth of 
wire insertion. This hole is sealed with a removable plug, which also serves to hold in the oxide-inhibiting 
compound (figure 2-17).
