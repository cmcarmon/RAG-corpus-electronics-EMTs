It may be noted that a reasonable optimization criterion may have no ﬁnite ﬁnal time tf. Instead, it may be
desired that the controller be continually active, implying tf → ∞ and eliminating the possibility of the ﬁnal
state term in Eq. (100.146). In this case, the optimization criterion is more properly written as
