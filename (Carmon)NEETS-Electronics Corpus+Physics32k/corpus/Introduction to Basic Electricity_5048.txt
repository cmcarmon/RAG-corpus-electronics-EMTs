A different technique uses a 1-inch square of 
sponge to dab the acid on the printed circuit board. 
The acid is absorbed in the sponge by pouring a small 
amount on it. The sponge is dabbed continuously on 
the copper on the board until the copper is removed. 
Boards with thinner copper etch faster.
