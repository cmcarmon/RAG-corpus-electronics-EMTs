and the Thévenin equivalent circuit for any such circuit is that of Figure 3.16. This equivalence applies no
matter how many sources or resistors may be present in the circuit. In the example (Example 3.2) below, we
know the circuit’s construction and element values, and derive the equivalent source and resistance. Because
Thévenin’s theorem applies in general, we should be able to make measurements or calculations only from
the terminals to determine the equivalent circuit.
