Lagging current can be formally defined as “an alternating current that reaches its maximum value up to 90 degrees behind the voltage that produces it.” This means that current lags the voltage when



β


{\displaystyle \beta }
, the angle of the current sine wave with respect to an arbitrarily chosen reference, is less than



δ


{\displaystyle \delta }
, the angle of the voltage sine wave with respect to the same reference. Therefore, current can quickly be identified as lagging if the angle



θ


{\displaystyle \theta }
is positive. For example, if the voltage angle



δ


{\displaystyle \delta }
is zero, current will be lagging if



β


{\displaystyle \beta }
is positive. This is often the case because voltage is taken as the reference.
In circuits with primarily inductive loads, current lags the voltage. This happens because in an inductive load, it is the induced electromotive force that causes the current to flow. Note that in the definition above, the current is produced by the voltage. The induced electromotive force is caused by a change in the magnetic flux linking the coils of an inductor.
