The harmonic components in a PWM wave are easily Ô¨Åltered because they are shifted to a higher-frequency
region. It is desirable to have a high ratio of carrier frequency to fundamental frequency to reduce the harmonics
of  lower-frequency  components.  There  are  several  other  PWM  techniques  mentioned  in  the  literature.  The
most notable ones are selected harmonic elimination, hysteresis controller, and space vector PWM technique.
In inverters, if SCRs are used as power switching devices, an external forced commutation circuit has to be
used to turn off the devices. Now, with the availability of IGBTs above 1000-A, 1000-V ratings, they are being
used  in  applications  up  to  300-kW  motor  drives.  Above  this  power  rating,  GTOs  are  generally  used.  Power
Darlington transistors, which are available up to 800 A, 1200 V, could also be used for inverter applications.
