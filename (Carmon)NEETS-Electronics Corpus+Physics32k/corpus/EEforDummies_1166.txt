Testing capacitors
You use a capacitor to store electrical energy for a short period of time. (For 
coverage of capacitors, see Chapter 7.) If your multimeter doesn’t have a 
capacitor‐testing feature, you can still use the multimeter in the ohmmeter 
setting to help you decide whether to replace a capacitor.
