The electromagnet, which consists of a coil wrapped around an iron core, is 
attached to the cone. As electrical current alternates back and forth through 
the coil, the electromagnet gets pulled toward and then pushed away from 
the permanent magnet. (ChapterÂ 8 tells you more about the ups and downs 
of electromagnets.) The motion of the electromagnet causes the cone to 
vibrate, which creates sound waves.
