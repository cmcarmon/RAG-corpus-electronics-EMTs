Building the circuit with a solderless breadboard
Figures 3-8 and 3-9 show the circuit 
set up on a solderless breadboard. 
You find out in Chapters 2 and 15 
that a solderless breadboard makes 
connections between holes so that 
all you have to do is insert compo-
nents in the right places. On the left 
and right sides of the breadboard, 
all the holes in each column are con-
nected to each other. In each of the 
two center sections of the bread-
board, the five holes in each row are 
all connected to each other.
