Note  that,  to  avoid  confusion  about  whether  a 
number is hexadecimal or decimal, we often place a 
$ symbol before a hexadecimal number or add an H 
to  the  end  of  the  number.  For  example,  64  means 
decimal 
$64  means 
hexadecimal  ‘six-four’,  which  is  equivalent  to 
decimal  100.  Similarly,  7FH  means  hexadecimal 
‘seven-F’ which is equivalent to decimal 127.
