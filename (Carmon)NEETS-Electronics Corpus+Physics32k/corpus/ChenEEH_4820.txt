. Polymorphism is a property relating to the ability of a
subclass of a superclass to tailor itself for a speciﬁc appli-
cation or override the methods deﬁned in the superclass.
Thus, one method in a superclass might mean different
things in different subclasses. The primary advantage is
that one set of operations can be applied to objects, and
the appropriate implementation of each operation is
chosen dependent on the class of object to which it is
applied.
