Calculating the capacitance of a system amounts to solving the Laplace equation ∇2φ = 0 with a constant potential φ on the surface of the conductors. This is trivial in cases with high symmetry. There is no solution in terms of elementary functions in more complicated cases.
For two-dimensional situations analytic functions may be used to map different geometries to each other. See also Schwarz–Christoffel mapping.
