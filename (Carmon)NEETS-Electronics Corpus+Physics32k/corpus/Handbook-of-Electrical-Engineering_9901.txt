Symmetry of Root Loci.  The root loci are symmetrical with respect to the axes of symmetry of the pole-zero
conﬁguration of G(s)H(s). In general, the root loci are symmetrical at least to the real axis of the complex s plane.
Asymptotes of the Root Loci. Asymptotes of the root loci refer to the behavior of the root loci at *s * = ¥ when
the number of poles and zeros of G(s)H(s) is not equal. Let N denote the number of ﬁnite poles of G(s)H(s)
and M be the number of ﬁnite zeros of G(s)H(s). In general, 2*N – M* of the loci will approach inﬁnity in the
s plane. The properties of the root loci at *s * = ¥ are described by the angles and the intersects of the asymptotes.
When N „ M, the angles of the asymptotes are given by
