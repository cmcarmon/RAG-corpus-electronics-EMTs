When the probability distribution has a finite and nonzero arithmetic mean, the relative mean absolute difference, sometimes denoted by Î” or RMD, is defined by

{\displaystyle \mathrm {RMD} ={\frac {\mathrm {MD} }{\text{arithmetic mean}}}.}

The relative mean absolute difference quantifies the mean absolute difference in comparison to the size of the mean and is a dimensionless quantity. The relative mean absolute difference is equal to twice the Gini coefficient which is defined in terms of the Lorenz curve. This relationship gives complementary perspectives to both the relative mean absolute difference and the Gini coefficient, including alternative ways of calculating their values.
