Horses are used to measure distances in horse racing â€“ a horse length (shortened to merely a length when the context makes it obvious) equals roughly 8 feet or 2.4 metres. Shorter distances are measured in fractions of a horse length; also common are measurements of a full or fraction of a head, a neck, or a nose. "Neck and neck" is an example of a linguistic Siamese twin which refers to the neck as a unit of measurement in horse racing.
