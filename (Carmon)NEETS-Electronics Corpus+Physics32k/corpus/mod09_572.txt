View (A) of figure 4-20 is a positive clamper with negative bias. Observe that with no input signal, 
the capacitor charges through R1 to the bias battery voltage; the output voltage equals −10 volts. The 
circuit has negative bias because the positive side of the battery is grounded. The output waveform is 
shown in view (B). Study the figure and waveforms carefully and note the following important points. 
Once again the peak-to-peak amplitude and shape of the output wave are, for all practical purposes, the 
same as the input wave. The lower extremity of the output wave is clamped to −10 volts, the value of the 
battery. Let's look at the circuit operation. The capacitor is initially charged to −10 volts with no input 
signal, and diode D1 does not conduct.
