Preliminaries and Basic DeÔ¨Ånitions
A disk, whether magnetic or optical, consists of a number of tracks along which the information is recorded.
These tracks may be concentric rings of a certain width, Wt, as shown in Fig. 80.21. Neighboring tracks may
be separated from each other by a guard band whose width we shall denote by Wg . In the least sophisticated
recording scheme imaginable, marks of length D0 are recorded along these tracks. Now, if each mark can be in
either one of two states, present or absent, it may be associated with a binary digit, 0 or 1. When the entire
disk surface of radius R is covered with such marks, its capacity C0 will be
