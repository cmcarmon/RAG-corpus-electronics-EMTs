2. Microcoded processors architecture supported by
Cathedral II is appropriate for low- to medium-rate
algorithms with heavy decision making and intensive
computations. Each processor is a dedicated inter-
connection of bit-parallel execution units controlled
by branch controllers (e.g., highly complex, block-
oriented DSP algorithms in the audio- to near-video-
frequency range).
