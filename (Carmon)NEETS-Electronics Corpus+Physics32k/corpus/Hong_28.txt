A  typical  example  of  a  capacitor  circuit  is  shown  in  Figure  2.5,  where  the 
capacitor  is  connected  in  series  with  a  resistor,  a  switch,  and  an  ideal  voltage  source. 
t < , the switch is open and the voltage on the capacitor is zero. The switch

.  As  voltage  builds  on  the  capacitor,  the 
in
corresponding  voltage  on  the  resistor  is  therefore  decreased.  The  reduction  in  voltage 
leads to a reduction of the current through the circuit loop and slows the charging process. 
The exact behavior of voltage across the capacitor can be found by solving the first order 
differential equation,
