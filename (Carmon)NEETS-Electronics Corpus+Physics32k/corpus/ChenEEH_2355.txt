symbol. The third and fourth columns are the waveguide
physical dimensions, and the Ô¨Åfth and sixth columns are the
operating frequency and the cutoff frequency, respectively. The
last column gives the loss per unit length for different plating
materials in the waveguide internal walls, such as aluminum
(Al), silver (Ag), and copper (Cu).
