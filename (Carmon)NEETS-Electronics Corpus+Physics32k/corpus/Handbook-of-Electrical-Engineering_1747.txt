Analysis and Computer Vision
The process of extracting useful measurements from an image or sequence of images is known as image analysis
or computer vision. Before analysis can be performed one must ﬁrst determine pertinent features or attributes
of the object in the scene and extract information about these features. The selection of which features in the
image  to  measure  must  be  chosen  a  priori,  based  on  empirical  results.  Most  features  used  consist  of  shape
properties, shape change properties, shading, texture, motion, depth, and color. After the features are extracted,
one must then use the feature measurements to determine scene characteristics such as object identiﬁcation.
In  the  past,  simple  pattern  recognition  algorithms,  i.e.,  nearest-neighbor  classiﬁcation,  have  been  used  to
compare the feature measurements of an image to a set of feature measurements that correspond to a known
object. A decision is then made as to whether or not the features of the image match those of the known type.
Recently, there has been work in the application of artiﬁcial intelligence techniques to image analysis. These
approaches are very much different from classical statistical pattern recognition in that the feature measurements
are used in a different manner as part of a larger system that attempts to model the scene and then determine
what is in it based on the model.
