The objective here is to decide whether H0 or H1 is true
based on the observation of X ¼ x. A decision rule, namely a
detection scheme, d(x) essentially partitions V into two sub-
spaces V0 and V1. The subspace V0 consists of all observations
that lead to the decision that H0 is true, while V1 consists of all
observations that lead to the decision that H1 is true. For
notational convenience, one may also deﬁne d(x) as follows:
