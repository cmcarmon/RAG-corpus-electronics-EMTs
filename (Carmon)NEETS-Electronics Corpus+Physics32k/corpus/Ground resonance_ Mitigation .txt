Proper maintenance of the helicopter's damping system components can prevent ground resonance from taking hold. When it does occur, recovery is often possible if action is taken quickly. If sufficient rotor RPM exists, immediate takeoff can restore rotor balance by allowing the airframe to freely move and help dampen the oscillation. If rotor RPM is very low during a ground resonance incident, complete shutdown may be sufficient.
