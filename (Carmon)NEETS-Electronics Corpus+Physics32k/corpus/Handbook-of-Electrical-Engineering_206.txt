All  plastic  batteries  can  be  recharged  hundreds  of  times  and  operate  under  extreme  hot  and  cold
temperature conditions without serious performance degradation.  The ﬁnished cell can be as thin as a
business card and malleable, allowing battery manufacturers to cut a cell to a speciﬁc space or make the
battery the actual case of the device to be powered.  (Reprinted with permission from NASA Tech Briefs,
