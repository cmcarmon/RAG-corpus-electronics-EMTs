The common base ampliﬁer is also known as the grounded base ampliﬁer. This ampliﬁer can
produce a voltage gain but generates no current gain between the input and the output sig-
nals. It is normally characterized by a very small input impedance and an output impedance
like the common emitter ampliﬁer. Because the input and output currents are of similar size,
the stray capacitance of the transistor is of less signiﬁcance than for the common emitter
ampliﬁer. The common base ampliﬁer is often used at high frequencies where it provides
more voltage ampliﬁcation than the other one-transistor circuits.
