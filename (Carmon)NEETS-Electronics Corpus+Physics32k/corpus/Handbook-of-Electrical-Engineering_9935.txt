PID Controllers
Proportional-plus-integral-plus-derivative (PID) compensators are probably the most utilized form for com-
pensators. These compensators are essentially equivalent to a phase-lag compensator cascaded with a phase-
lead compensator. The transfer function of this compensator is given by
