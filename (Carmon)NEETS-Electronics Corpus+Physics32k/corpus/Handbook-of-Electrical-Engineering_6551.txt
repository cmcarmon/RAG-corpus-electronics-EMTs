Modulator
A digital electrical signal modulates the light source. The driver circuit must be fast enough to operate at the
system bit rate. As bit rates increase into the multigigabit per second range, this becomes increasingly difÔ¨Åcult.
Modulation can be done in the optical domain at very high speeds. In this case, the modulator follows the laser
diode rather than preceding it. External modulation is usually accomplished using integrated-optic structures.
