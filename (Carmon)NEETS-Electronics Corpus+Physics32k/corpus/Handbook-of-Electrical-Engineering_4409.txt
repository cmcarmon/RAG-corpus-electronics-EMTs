Mechanical Systems. An accurate preform feed mechanism and drive capstan form the basis of Ô¨Åber speed
control. The mechanism allows the preform to be fed at a constant speed into the hot zone, while maintaining
the preform at the center of the furnace opening at the top. A centering device is used to position preforms
that  are  not  perfectly  straight.  The  preform  is  usually  held  with  a  collet-type  chuck  mounted  in  a  vertically
movable carriage, which is driven by a lead screw. A precision stainless-steel drive capstan is mounted on the
