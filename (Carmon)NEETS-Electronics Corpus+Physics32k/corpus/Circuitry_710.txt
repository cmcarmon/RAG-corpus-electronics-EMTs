Transistors  may  fail  in  a  number  of  ways. 
Individual  junctions  may  become  open-circuit  or 
short-circuit.  In  some  cases  the  entire  device  may 
become short-circuit or exhibit a very low value of 
internal  resistance.  The  precise  nature  of  the  fault 
will  usually  depend  upon  the  electrical  conditions 
prevalent  at  the  time  of  failure.  Excessive  reverse 
voltage, for example, is likely to cause a collector-
base  or  base-emitter  junction  to  become  open-
circuit.  Momentary  excessive  collector  current  is 
likely  to  rupture  the  base-emitter  junction  while 
long-term  over-dissipation  is  likely  to  cause  an 
internal  short-circuit  or  very 
resistance 
condition which may, in some cases, affect all three 
terminals of the device.
