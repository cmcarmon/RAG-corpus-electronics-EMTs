Once a good schematic diagram is confirmed through 
breadboarding, either physical or virtual, the printed 
circuit board can be laid out. The necessary electronic 
components should be collected for sizing the design 
layout. Leave the components from the breadboard 
together and use them only as a last resort. A work-
ing circuit on the breadboard can be used for trou-
bleshooting in the event there is a problem with the 
printed circuit board design.
