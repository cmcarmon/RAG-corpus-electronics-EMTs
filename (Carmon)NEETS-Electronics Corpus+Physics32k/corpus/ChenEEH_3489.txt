formulas that may be applied to solve problems. One particu-
larly useful set of formulas is the ideal rectiﬁer set of formulas
shown in Table 10.8. Rectiﬁer loads are a main source of
harmonic load currents. The ideal rectiﬁer formulas give the
various interrelationships of voltage and current parameters
for the idealized case of no rectiﬁer power loss and very high
dc side inductance. These formulas, while useful, should be
used with caution because the assumptions made in arriving
at these formulas are all idealizations. Note that the displace-
ment factor is the cosine of the angle between fundamental
voltage and fundamental current. The power factor is the ratio
P=VrmsIrms.
