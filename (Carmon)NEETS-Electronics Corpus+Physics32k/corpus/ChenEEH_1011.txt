The dependence of the power consumption on many param-
eters allows the VLSI designer to have a large number of
techniques available to reduce the power dissipation. From
the equations presented in the previous section, the following
parameters should be considered when designing for low
power: power-supply voltage, device-threshold voltage, phys-
ical node capacitance, and switching frequency.
