EABA has three types of damage, lethal, half-lethal, and non-lethal. Cutting and piercing attacks tend to be lethal, crushing attacks half-lethal and unarmed attacks non-lethal.
Armor is rated in terms of die(s) it will stop, and that is subtracted from the possible damage the attack may cause. So armor rated at 1d will reduce 1d of damage to nothing, and 2d of damage to 1d. Armor will generally always stop damage from attacks lower than its rating. For example, a bullet proof vest rated to stop .22 caliber rounds will always stop them, provided the round hits the vest.
Additional damage to an already injured body part will have less effect than the first damage. ie, shooting someone in the leg once will reduce their mobility a lot and cause bleeding; shooting the same leg three more times will not reduce their mobility much more.
