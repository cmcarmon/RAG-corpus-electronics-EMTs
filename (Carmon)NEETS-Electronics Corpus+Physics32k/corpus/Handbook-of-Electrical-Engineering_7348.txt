A radio telemetry system comprises (1) transducers that convert measurements into electrical systems, (2) a
subcarrier oscillator modulated by the transducers, (3) a radio transmitter modulated by the subcarrier, (4) a
transmitting antenna, (5) a receiving antenna, (6) a radio receiver, and (7) a subcarrier discriminator. The radio
link can transmit an analog of the continuous variable being measured, or, with pulse-code methods, it sends
the measurement data digitally as a ﬁnite number of symbols representing a ﬁnite number of possible values
of the measurement signal at the time it is sampled. The range of a radio link is limited by the power radiated
toward the receiver from the transmitter and by the sensitivity of the receiver. The wider the bandwidth, the
more the effect from noise, and therefore the more transmitted power required for a detectable signal.
