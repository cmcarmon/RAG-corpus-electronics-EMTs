Analysis-by-Synthesis
A signiﬁcant drawback to traditional “instantaneous” coding approaches such as DPCM lies in the perceptual
or  subjective  relevance  of  the  distortion  measure  and  the  signals  to  which  it  is  applied.  Thus,  the  advent  of
analysis-by-synthesis coding techniques poses an important milestone in the evolution of medium- to low-rate
speech coding. An analysis-by-synthesis coder chooses the coder excitation by minimizing distortion between
the original signal and the set of synthetic signals produced by every possible codebook excitation sequence.
In  contrast,  time-domain  predictive  coders  must  produce  an  estimated  prediction  residual  (innovations
sequence)  to  drive  the  spectral  shaping  ﬁlter(s)  of  the  LPC  model,  and  the  classical  DPCM  approach  is  to
quantize  the  residual  sequence  directly  using  scalar  or  vector  quantizers.  The  incorporation  of  frequency-
weighted distortion in the optimization of analysis-by-synthesis coders is signiﬁcant in that it de-emphasizes
(increases the tolerance for) quantization noise surrounding spectral peaks. This effect is perceptually trans-
parent since the ear is less sensitive to error around frequencies having higher energy [Atal and Schroeder, 1979].
This approach has resulted in signiﬁcant improvements in low-rate coder performance, and recent increases
in  processor  speed  and  power  are  crucial  enabling  techniques  for  these  applications.  Analysis-by-synthesis
coders based on linear prediction are generally described as hybrid coders since they fall between waveform
coders and vocoders.
