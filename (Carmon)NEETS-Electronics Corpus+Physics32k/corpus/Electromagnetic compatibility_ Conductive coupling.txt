Conductive coupling occurs when the coupling path between the source and the receptor is formed by direct electrical contact with a conducting body, for example a transmission line, wire, cable, PCB trace or metal enclosure.
Conducted noise is also characterised by the way it appears on different conductors:
Common-mode or common-impedance coupling: noise appears in phase (in the same direction) on two conductors.
Differential-mode coupling: noise appears out of phase (in opposite directions) on two conductors.
