A second category of transducer provides large acoustic standing waves at a particular frequency and, as a
result, has a resonant electrical input impedance at this frequency and can be used as a narrowband ﬁlter in
electrical circuits. In a third category of transducer, the object is to provide an acoustic beam that distorts the
medium, as it passes through, in a manner periodic in space and time, and thus provides a dynamic diffraction
grating that will deﬂect or modulate an optical beam that is passed through it [see Fig. 48.4(c)]. Such acousto-
optic devices are used in broadband signal processing.
