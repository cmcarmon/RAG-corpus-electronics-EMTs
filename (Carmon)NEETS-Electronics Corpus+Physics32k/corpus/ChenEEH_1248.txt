In Chapter 4, ‘‘Operating Systems,’’ by Yao-Nan Lien, the
hardware core of a basic computer system, which consists of
processor(s), memory, and peripheral devices is presented. It is
often tedious to write programs that keep track of all these
hardware components. The operating system is software,
which controls all the computer’s resources and provides the
base on which the application programs can be written. The
operating system puts a layer of software on top of the bare
hardware, manages all parts of the system, and presents the
user with an interface or virtual machine that is easier to
understand and program. The operating system can be viewed
as a set of software extensions of primitive hardware, culmin-
ating in a virtual machine that serves as a high-level program-
ming environment and manages the ﬂow of work network of
computers. Modern operating systems also provide numerous
services, such as interprocess communication, ﬁle and direc-
tory systems, data transfer over networks, and a command
language for invoking and controlling programs. In addition
to the basic concept on operating systems, the chapter further
explores a model operating system as well as two exemplifying
operating systems: Unix and MS-DOS.
