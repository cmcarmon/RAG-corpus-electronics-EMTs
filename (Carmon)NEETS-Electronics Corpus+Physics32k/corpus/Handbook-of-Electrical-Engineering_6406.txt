The least-mean-squared (LMS) equalizer [Lucky et al.,1968] is more robust. Here the equalizer coefﬁcients
are chosen to minimize the mean squared error (MSE)—the sum of squares of all the ISI terms plus the noise
power  at  the  output  of  the  equalizer.  Therefore,  the  LMS  equalizer  maximizes  the  signal-to-distortion  ratio
(S/D) at its output within the constraints of the equalizer time span and the delay through the equalizer.
