Now, insert your multimeter at another connection point in the circuit (for 
instance, between the positive battery lead and the resistor), taking care to 
open the circuit at the point of measurement and to orient the multimeter 
leads with the positive lead at a more positive voltage point than the negative 
lead. Do you get the same current reading as before? You should, because 
this simple circuit provides only one path for current to flow.
