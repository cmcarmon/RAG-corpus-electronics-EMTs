p r o b l e m 10.2
The inverter-pair comprising INV1 and INV2 studied in Prob-
lem 10.1 (see Figure 10.92) drives another inverter INV3 as illustrated in Figure 10.94a.
Logically, the series connected pair of inverters INV1 and INV2 function as a buffer,
as depicted in Figure 10.94b. The equivalent circuit of the buffer circuit driving INV3
is illustrated in Figure 10.94c. For this problem, use the equivalent circuit model for
an inverter based on the SRC model of the MOSFET as depicted in Figure 10.93.
Assume further that each of the inverters satisfies the static discipline with voltage thresh-
olds VIL = VOL = VL and VIH = VOH = VH. Assume further that the MOSFET
threshold voltage is VT. (Note that to satisfy the static discipline, the following is true:
VL < VT < VH.)
