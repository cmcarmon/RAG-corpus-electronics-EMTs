The classical theory of frozen orbits is essentially based on the analytical perturbation analysis for artificial satellites of Dirk Brouwer made under contract with NASA and published in 1959.
This analysis can be carried out as follows:
In the article orbital perturbation analysis the secular perturbation of the orbital pole

which can be expressed in terms of orbital elements as
In the same article the secular perturbation of the components of the eccentricity vector caused by the

{\displaystyle J_{2}\,}
is shown to be:
where:
The first term is the in-plane perturbation of the eccentricity vector caused by the in-plane component of the perturbing force
The second term is the effect of the new position of the ascending node in the new orbital plane, the orbital plane being perturbed by the out-of-plane force component
Making the analysis for the

{\displaystyle J_{3}\,}

For inclinations in the range 97.8–99.0 deg, the
