The PUREX Plant at the Hanford Site was responsible for producing 'copious volumes of liquid wastes', resulting in the radioactive contamination of groundwater. A U.S. government report released in 1992 estimated that 685,000 curies (25.3 PBq) of radioactive iodine-131 had been released into the river and air from the Hanford site between 1944 and 1947.
Greenpeace measurements in La Hague and Sellafield indicated that radioactive pollutants are steadily released into the sea, and the air. Therefore, people living near these processing plants are exposed to higher radiation levels than the naturally occurring background radiation. This additional radiation is small but not negligible according to Greenpeace.
