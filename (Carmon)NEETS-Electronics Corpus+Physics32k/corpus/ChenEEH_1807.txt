(IETF) has developed an enhanced Internet service model
called Integrated Services
(IntServ) (White, 1997). This
model is characterized by resource reservations. It requires
applications to know their trafﬁc characteristics and QoS re-
quirements beforehand and signal the intermediate network
routers to reserve resources, like bandwidth and buffers, to
meet them. Accordingly, if the requested resources are avail-
able, the routers reserve them and send back a positive ac-
knowledgment to the source, which allows data to be sent. If,
on the other hand, sufﬁcient resources are not available at any
router in the path, the request is turned down, and the source
has to try again after some time. This model also requires the
use of packet classiﬁers to identify ﬂows that are to receive a
certain level of service as well as packet schedulers to handle
the forwarding of different packets in a manner to ensure that
the QoS commitments are met.
