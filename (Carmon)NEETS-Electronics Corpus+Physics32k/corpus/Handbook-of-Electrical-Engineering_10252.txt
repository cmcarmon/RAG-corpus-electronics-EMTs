AIMS functions performed in both cabinets include ﬂight management, electronic ﬂight instrument system
(EFIS)  and  engine  indicating  and  crew  alerting  system  (EICAS)  displays  management,  central  maintenance,
airplane condition monitoring, communications management, data conversion and gateway (ARINC 429 and
ARINC 629), and engine data interface. AIMS does not control the engines nor ﬂight controls, nor operate any
internal or external voice or data link communications hardware but does select the data link path as part of
the communications management function. Subsequent generations of AIMS may include some of these latter
functions.
