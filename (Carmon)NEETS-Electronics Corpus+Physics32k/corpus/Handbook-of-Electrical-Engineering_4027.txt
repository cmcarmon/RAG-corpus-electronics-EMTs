Gain:  A measure of the ability of a network to increase the energy level of a signal. Gain is generally measured
in decibels. For voltage or current gain: G (dB) = 20 log(Sout/Sin), where S is the RF voltage or current
out of and into the network. For power gain G (dB) = 10 log(Pout/Pin). If the network has net loss, the
gain will be negative.
