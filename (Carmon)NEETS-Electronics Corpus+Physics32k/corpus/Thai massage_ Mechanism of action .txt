All types of massage, including Thai massage, can help people relax, relieve aching muscles, and temporarily boost a person's mood. However, many therapists make claims that go far beyond what massage can accomplish. It does increase circulation, gives temporary relief of pain, provides a sense of well-being, and promotes relaxation, but there is little evidence of further benefits.
