Computing the inverse DFT yields a length-N signal no matter what the actual duration of the unit-
sample response might be. If the unit-sample response has a duration less than or equal to N (it’s a FIR
ﬁlter), computing the inverse DFT of the sampled frequency response indeed yields the unit-sample response.
If, however, the duration exceeds N, errors are encountered. The nature of these errors is easily explained
by appealing to the Sampling Theorem. By sampling in the frequency domain, we have the potential for
aliasing in the time domain (sampling in one domain, be it time or frequency, can result in aliasing in the
other) unless we sample fast enough. Here, the duration of the unit-sample response determines the minimal
sampling rate that prevents aliasing. For FIR systems — they by deﬁnition have ﬁnite-duration unit sample
responses — the number of required DFT samples equals the unit-sample response’s duration: N ≥ q.
Exercise 5.29
(Solution on p. 193.)
Derive the minimal DFT length for a length-q unit-sample response using the Sampling Theorem.
Because sampling in the frequency domain causes repetitions of the unit-sample response in the
time domain, sketch the time-domain result for various choices of the DFT length N.
Exercise 5.30
(Solution on p. 193.)
Express the unit-sample response of a FIR ﬁlter in terms of diﬀerence equation coeﬃcients. Note
that the corresponding question for IIR ﬁlters is far more diﬃcult to answer: Consider the example
(Example 5.5).
