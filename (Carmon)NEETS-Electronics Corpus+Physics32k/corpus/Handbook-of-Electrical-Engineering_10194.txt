Processing
Robotic  processing  applications  are  considered  here  to  be  those
applications in which a robot actually performs work on a part and
requires that the end effector is a tool. Examples include spot welding
electrodes, arc welding, and spray-painting nozzles. The most com-
mon  robotic  applications  in  manufacturing  processes  are  listed  in
Table 101.2 [Odrey, 1992a]. Many more processing applications are
possible.
