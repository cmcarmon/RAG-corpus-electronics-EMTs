Different timezones selectable when entering and editing start and end times. This allows long-distance airplane flight times, for example, to be entered accurately and for that "end" of a visualized time "box" to render accurately on either iOS or macOS when timezone support is turned on in Calendar and the timezone set in Date/Time to the location in question. Thus now compliant with RFC 6868 iCalendar.
