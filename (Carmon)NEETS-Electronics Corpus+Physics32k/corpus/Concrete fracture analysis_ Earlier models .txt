Dugdale Model
Major assumptions of this model were:
A plastic zone is present near the crack tip.
Critical stress value is a constant and it is equal to yield stress across the crack.

Barenblatt Model

A plastic zone is present near the crack tip.
Critical stress value is varying along with deformation produced.

The main drawback of both these models was negligence of concept of fracture energy.
