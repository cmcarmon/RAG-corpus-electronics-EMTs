The buckling force in the track due to warming up is a function of the rise in temperature only and is independent of the track length:

{\displaystyle F=EA\alpha _{L}\Delta T}
.
Derivation of buckling force function:
The linear thermal expansion due to heating of the track is found using

L


{\displaystyle {\Delta L}=\alpha _{L}\Delta T\ L}

where
ΔL = thermal expansion of the rail
L = length of the rail/track
α = coefficient of thermal expansion
ΔT = increase in temperature
According to Hooke's law the extension due to a force (in the rail) is




Δ
L
=


F

E
A



L


{\displaystyle \Delta L={\frac {F}{EA}}L}

where
ΔL = extension of the rail/track
F = the force extending a rod, here the induced force in the rail
E = modulus of elasticity of rail material (steel)
A = cross section of rail
L = length of rail
Putting these together gives
