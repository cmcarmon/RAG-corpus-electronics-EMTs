Introduction
The concept of a LM18 was introduced in the just-completed
material on HMMs because these stochastic models play such
a prominent role in representing language structure in con-
temporary speech recognition systems. More generally, how-
ever, LM research has a long and interesting history in which
numerous and varied systems have been produced. The ﬁeld
remains very active with many challenging unsolved problems.
In the scope of this vast history and level of current activity,
the goal of this section is very modest—to provide an overview
of some of the basic operating principles and terminology
of LM’ing18 particularly those related to the HMM-like for-
malisms discussed above.
