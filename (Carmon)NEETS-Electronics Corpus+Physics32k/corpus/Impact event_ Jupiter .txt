On July 1994, Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 was a comet that broke apart and collided with Jupiter, providing the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of Solar System objects. The event served as a "wake-up call", and astronomers responded by starting programs such as Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR), Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking (NEAT), Lowell Observatory Near-Earth Object Search (LONEOS) and several others which have drastically increased the rate of asteroid discovery.
The 2009 Jupiter impact event happened on July 19 when a new black spot about the size of Earth was discovered in Jupiter's southern hemisphere by amateur astronomer Anthony Wesley. Thermal infrared analysis showed it was warm and spectroscopic methods detected ammonia. JPL scientists confirmed that there was another impact event on Jupiter, probably involving a small undiscovered comet or other icy body. The impactor is estimated to have been about 200–500 meters in diameter.
A 2010 Jupiter impact event occurred on June 3 involving an object estimated at 8–13 meters was recorded and first reported by Anthony Wesley.
On Sept 10, 2012, amateur astronomer Dan Petersen visually detected a fireball on Jupiter that lasted 1 or 2 seconds using a 12″ LX200. It was estimated that the fireball was created by a meteoroid less than 10 meters in diameter.
On March 17, 2016, a Jupiter impact event occurred involving an unknown object, possibly a small comet or asteroid estimated at 30–90 meters (or a few hundred feet) across. Footage of the event was recorded from the telescope of amateur astronomer John McKeon.
