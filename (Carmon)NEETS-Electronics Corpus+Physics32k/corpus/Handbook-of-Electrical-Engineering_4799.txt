Electrostriction: The change in size of a nonpolarized, dielectric material when it is placed in an electric ﬁeld.
Ferroelectric: A material with permanent charge dipoles which arise from asymmetries in the crystal struc-
ture.  The  electric  ﬁeld  due  to  these  dipoles  can  be  observed  external  to  the  material  when  certain
conditions are satisﬁed (ordered material and no charge on the surfaces).
