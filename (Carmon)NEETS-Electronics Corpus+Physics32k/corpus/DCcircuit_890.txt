• Multiple thermocouple junctions can be connected in parallel with each other to generate
a voltage signal representing the average temperature between the junctions. ”Swamp-
ing” resistors may be connected in series with each thermocouple to help maintain equal-
ity between the junctions, so the resultant voltage will be more representative of a true
average temperature.
