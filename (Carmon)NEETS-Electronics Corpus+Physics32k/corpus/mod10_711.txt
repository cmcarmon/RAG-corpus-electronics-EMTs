When more than two elements are used in a broadside arrangement, they are all parallel and in the 
same plane, as shown in figure 4-26, view B. Current phase, indicated by the arrows, must be the same for 
all elements. The radiation pattern shown in figure 4-26, view C, is always bi-directional. This pattern is 
sharper than the one shown in figure 4-27 because of the additional two elements. Directivity and gain 
depend on the number of elements and the spacing between them.
