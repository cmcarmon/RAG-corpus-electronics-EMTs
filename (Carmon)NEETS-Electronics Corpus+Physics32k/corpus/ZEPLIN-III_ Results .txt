Although the ZEPLIN-III liquid xenon target was built on the same scale as that of its ZEPLIN predecessors, it achieved significant improvements in WIMP sensitivity due to the higher discrimination factor achieved and to a lower overall background. In 2011 it published exclusion limits on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon elastic scattering cross-section above 3.9 × 10−8 pb for a 50 GeV WIMP mass. Although not as stringent as results from XENON100, this was achieved with a 10 times smaller fiducial mass and demonstrated the best background discrimination ever achieved in these detectors. The WIMP-neutron spin-dependent cross-section was excluded above 8.0 × 10−3 pb. It also ruled out an inelastic WIMP scattering model which attempted to reconcile a positive claim from DAMA with the absence of signal in other experiments.
