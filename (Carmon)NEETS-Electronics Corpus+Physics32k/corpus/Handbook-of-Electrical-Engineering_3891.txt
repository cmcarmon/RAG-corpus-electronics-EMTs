Geometric Designs
The phase difference in a linear array was caused by the spatial separation and allowed the discrimination of
plane waves arriving at different angles. Desired phase patterns can be determined by using analytic geometry
to position the elements. For example, if coherent superposition across a wave front is desired, the wave front
can  be  directed  (reﬂected,  refracted,  or  diffracted)  to  the  receiver  in  phase.  For  a  planar  wave  front,  this
corresponds to a constant path length from any point on the reference plane to the receiver. Using the geometry
in Fig. 38.12, the sum of the two lengths (x, R + h) to (x, y) and (x, y) to (0, h) must be a constant independent
of  x—which is R + 2h for this geometry. This constraint on the length is
