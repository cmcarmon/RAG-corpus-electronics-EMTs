temperature  sensor  in  close  proximity  to  the 
thermometer  in  the  air  flow  from  the  hair  drier. 
Slowly  increase  the  temperature  and  record  the 
output voltage for each increase of 10Â°C indicated 
on the thermometer using the table shown in Table 
16.5. 
 
Graph and calculations 
 
Plot  a  graph  showing  output  voltage  against 
temperature (see Fig. 16.36) and measure the slope 
of the graph.  
 
Conclusions 
 
Comment  on  the  shape  of  the  graph.  Is  this  what 
you  would  expect?  Suggest  an  application  for  the 
circuit.
