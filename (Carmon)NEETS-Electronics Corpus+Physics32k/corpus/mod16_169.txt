With the ac signal applied to the bridge, R1 and R2 are varied until a zero reading is seen on the
meter. Zero deflection indicates that the bridge is balanced. (NOTE: In actual practice, the variables are
adjusted for a minimum reading since the phase difference between the two legs will not always allow a
zero reading.)
