The arithmetic-logic section performs all arithmetic operations-adding, subtracting, multiplying, and 
dividing. Through its logic capability, it tests various conditions encountered during processing and takes 
action based on the result. As indicated by the solid arrows in figure 2-1, data flows between the 
arithmetic-logic section and the internal storage section during processing. Specifically, data is transferred 
as needed from the internal storage section to the arithmetic-logic section, processed, and returned to the 
internal storage section. At no time does processing take place in the storage section. Data may be 
transferred back and forth between these two sections several times before processing is completed. The 
results are then transferred from internal storage to an output unit, as indicated by the solid arrow (fig. 
2-1).
