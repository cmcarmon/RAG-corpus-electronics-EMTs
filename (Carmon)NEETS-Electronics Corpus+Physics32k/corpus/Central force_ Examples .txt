Gravitational force and Coulomb force are two familiar examples with



F
(

r

)


{\displaystyle F(\mathbf {r} )}
being proportional to 1/r2 only. An object in such a force field with negative



F
(

r

)


{\displaystyle F(\mathbf {r} )}
(corresponding to an attractive force) obeys Kepler's laws of planetary motion.
The force field of a spatial harmonic oscillator is central with



F
(

r

)


{\displaystyle F(\mathbf {r} )}
proportional to r only and negative.
By Bertrand's theorem, these two,



F
(

r

)
=
−
k

/


r

2




{\displaystyle F(\mathbf {r} )=-k/r^{2}}
and



F
(

r

)
=
−
k
r


{\displaystyle F(\mathbf {r} )=-kr}
, are the only possible central force fields where all bounded orbits are stable closed orbits. However, there exist other force fields, which have some closed orbits.
