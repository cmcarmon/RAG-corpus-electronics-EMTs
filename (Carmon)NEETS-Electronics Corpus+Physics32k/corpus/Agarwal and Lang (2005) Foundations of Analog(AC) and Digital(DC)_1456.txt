The subcircuit for finding the ZIR is shown in Figure 10.30a. As before,
the capacitor is initially charged to V1, but here the input for t > 0 is zero, so
after the switch moves to position (2), the capacitor simply discharges to zero.
Formally, the corresponding equation to be solved to obtain the ZIR is
