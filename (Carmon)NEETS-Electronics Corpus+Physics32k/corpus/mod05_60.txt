Now you have two fields â€” the main field, view A, and the field around the armature coil, view B. 
View C of figure 1-8 shows how the armature field distorts the main field and how the neutral plane is 
shifted in the direction of rotation. If the brushes remain in the old neutral plane, they will be short-
circuiting coils that have voltage induced in them. Consequently, there will be arcing between the brushes 
and commutator.
