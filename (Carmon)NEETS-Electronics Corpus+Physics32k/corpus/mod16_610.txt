Cathode-ray tubes are identified by a tube number, such as 2AP1, 2BP4, or 5AP1A. The first number
identifies the diameter of the tube face. Typical diameters are 2 inches, 5 inches, and 7 inches. The first
letter designates the order in which a tube of a given diameter was registered. The letter-digit combination
indicates the type of phosphor (glowing material) used on the inside of the screen. Phosphor P1, which is
used in most oscilloscopes, produces a green light at medium PERSISTENCE. Persistence refers to the
length of time the phosphor glows after the electron beam is removed. P4 provides a white light and has a
short persistence. If a letter appears at the end, it signifies the number of the modification after the
original design.
