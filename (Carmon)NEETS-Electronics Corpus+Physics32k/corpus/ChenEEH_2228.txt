The total energy of a system is the sum of all these individual
energies. These expressions are useful to determine the forces
in electrostatic systems in the same way that the potential is
useful for obtaining the electric ﬁelds of those systems. For any
system of charges where the individual charges are conserved,
that is, when the ﬂux is constant, the force is given by the
negative gradient of the energy:
