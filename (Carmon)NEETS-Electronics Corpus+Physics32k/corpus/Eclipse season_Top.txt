An eclipse season is one of only two periods during a year when eclipses can occur, due to the orbital inclination of the Moon. Each season lasts for approximately 34 days and repeats just short of six months, thus two full eclipse seasons always occur each year. Either two or three eclipses happen each eclipse season. During the eclipse season, the inclination of the Moon's orbit is low, hence the Sun, Moon, and Earth become aligned straight enough (in syzygy) for an eclipse to occur.
During each season, the type of solar eclipse (whether total or annular, as seen from the sublunar point) depends on the apparent sizes of the Sun and Moon, which is a function of the elliptical distance of Earth from the Sun and of the Moon from Earth, respectively, as seen from Earth's surface.
If the Earth had a perfectly circular orbit centered around the Sun, if the Moon's orbit was also perfectly circular and centered around the Earth, and if both orbits were coplanar (on the same plane) with each other, then two eclipses would happen every lunar month (29.53 days). A lunar eclipse would occur at every full moon, a solar eclipse every new moon, and all solar eclipses would be the same type.
