Memory is also useful in enabling better resource utilization. Suppose we
wish to add three numbers A0 through A2. The addition can be accomplished
using two adder circuits as follows: The first and second numbers are fed to
the first adder. The result of the first adder and the third value are fed to the
second adder. The sum S is obtained as the output of the second adder.
