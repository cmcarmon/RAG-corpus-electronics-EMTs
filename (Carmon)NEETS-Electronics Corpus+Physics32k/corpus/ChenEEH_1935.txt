columns, with row busses being inputs only and column
busses being outputs only—the interconnects are not seg-
mented. Fault tolerance is then simply achieved by transposing
conﬁguration bits of a faulty PLB and that of the column
busses to which it is connected to a spare PLB in its row and
its corresponding column busses. However, bus-based FPGAs
have several drawbacks, including inefﬁcient use of intercon-
nect resources, which means that only very sparsely wired
designs—not typical of modern circuits—are implementable
on such FPGAs, and timing delays for short nets are excessive,
leading to slow designs.
