Soldering iron tips come in a wide variety of shapes 
and sizes to meet a specific application. Many solder-
ing irons have replaceable tips. The tip selected should 
provide maximum contact area between the surfaces 
to be joined and also allow accessibility to the connec-
tion. Figure 49-12 shows the most popular shapes of 
soldering iron tips. Typically, a small bevel tip is pre-
ferred for general printed circuit board work.
