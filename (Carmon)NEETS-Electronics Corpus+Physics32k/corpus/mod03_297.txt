A circuit protection device operates by opening and interrupting current to the circuit. The opening
of a protection device shows that something is wrong in the circuit and should be corrected before the
current is restored. When a problem exists and the protection device opens, the device should isolate the
faulty circuit from the other unaffected circuits, and should respond in time to protect unaffected
components in the faulty circuit. The protection device should NOT open during normal circuit operation.
