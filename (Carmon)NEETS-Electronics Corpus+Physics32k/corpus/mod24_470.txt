Multimode optical fiber launch conditions are typically characterized as being underfilled or
overfilled. An underfilled launch concentrates most of the optical power in the center of the fiber. An
underfilled launch results when the launch spot size and angular distribution are smaller than that of the
fiber core. Underfilling the fiber excites mainly low-order modes. Figure 5-2 illustrates an underfilled
launch condition.
