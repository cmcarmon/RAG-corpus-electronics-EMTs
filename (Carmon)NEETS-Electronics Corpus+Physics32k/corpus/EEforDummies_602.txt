Bipolar transistors essentially contain two pn‐junctions: the base‐emitter 
junction and the base‐collector junction. By controlling the voltage applied to 
the base‐emitter junction, you control how that junction is biased (forward 
or reverse), ultimately controlling the flow of electrical current through the 
transistor. (In Chapter 9, I explain that a small positive voltage forward‐biases 
a pn‐junction, allowing current to flow, and that a negative voltage reverse‐
biases a pn‐junction, prohibiting current from flowing.)
