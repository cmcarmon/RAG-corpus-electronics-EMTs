FIRST CONVERTER.â€”The first (front end) converter changes the input signal to a usable IF
signal that will either be 829 MHz or 2072 MHz. The IF signal to be produced is dependent on which
measurement band selection is currently being used. The 829 MHz IF signal will be selected for bands 2
through 4, while the 2072 MHz IF signal is selected for bands 1 and 5 through 11.
