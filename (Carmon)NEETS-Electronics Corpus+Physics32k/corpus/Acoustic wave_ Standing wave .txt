A standing wave is a special kind of wave that can occur in a resonator. In a resonator superposition of the incident and reflective wave occurs, causing a standing wave. Pressure and particle velocity are 90 degrees out of phase in a standing wave.
Consider a tube with two closed ends acting as a resonator. The resonator has normal modes at frequencies given by




f
=



N
c


2
d





N
∈
{
1
,
2
,
3
,
…
}


{\displaystyle f={\frac {Nc}{2d}}\qquad \qquad N\in \{1,2,3,\dots \}}

where




c


{\displaystyle c}
is the speed of sound in m/s




d


{\displaystyle d}
is the length of the tube in m
At the ends particle velocity becomes zero since there can be no particle displacement. Pressure however doubles at the ends because of interference of the incident wave with the reflective wave. As pressure is maximum at the ends while velocity is zero, there is a 90 degrees phase difference between them.
