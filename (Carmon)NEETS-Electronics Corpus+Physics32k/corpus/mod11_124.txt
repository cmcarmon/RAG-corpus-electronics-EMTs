The reason for using the decibel system when expressing signal strength may be seen in the power 
ratios in table 2-1. For example, to say that a reference signal has increased 50 dB is much easier than to 
say the output has increased 100,000 times. The amount of increase or decrease from a chosen reference 
level is the basis of the decibel measurement system, not the reference level itself. Whether the input 
power is increased from 1 watt to 100 watts or from 1,000 watts to 100,000 watts, the amount of increase 
is still 20 decibels.
