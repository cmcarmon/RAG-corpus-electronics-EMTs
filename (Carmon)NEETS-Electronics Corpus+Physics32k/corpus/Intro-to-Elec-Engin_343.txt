In a balanced three-phase system, the sum of the three individually pulsating phase powers
adds up to a constant, nonpulsating total power of magnitude three times the average real
power in each phase. That is, in spite of the sinusoidal nature of the voltages and currents,
the total instantaneous power delivered into the three-phase load is a constant, equal to the
total average power. The real power P is expressed in watts when voltage and current are
expressed in volts and amperes, respectively. You may recall that the instantaneous power in
single-phase ac circuits absorbed by a pure inductor or capacitor is a double-frequency sinusoid
with zero average value. The instantaneous power absorbed by a pure resistor has a nonzero
average value plus a double-frequency term with zero average value. The instantaneous reactive
power is alternately positive and negative, indicating the reversible ï¬‚ow of energy to and
from the reactive component of the load. Its amplitude or maximum value is known as the
reactive power.
