The above calculation shows that L1 offers a relatively high opposition (3.8 kilohms) to the ripple in 
comparison to the opposition offered by C1 (265 ohms). Thus, more ripple voltage will be dropped across 
L1 than across C1. In addition, the impedance of C1 (265 ohms) is relatively low with respect to the 
resistance of the load (10 kilohms). Therefore, more ripple current flows through C1 than the load. In 
other words, C1 shunts most of the ac component around the load.
