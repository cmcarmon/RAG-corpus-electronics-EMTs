Most DSP systems use ﬁxed-point hardware arithmetic operators. While many number system representa-
tions are possible, the two’s complement number system is the most popular number system. The other number
systems include the residue number system, the redundant or signed-digit number system, and the logarithmic
number system. The residue and logarithmic number systems are rarely used or are used in very special cases
such as nonrecursive digital ﬁlters. Shifting or scaling and division are difﬁcult in the residue number system.
Difﬁculty with addition and the overhead associated with logarithm and antilogarithm converters reduce the
attractiveness of the logarithm number system. The use of the redundant number system leads to carry-free
operation  but  is  accompanied  by  the  overhead  associated  with  redundant-to-two’s  complement  conversion.
Another approach often used is distributed arithmetic. This approach has recently been used in a few video
transformation chips.
