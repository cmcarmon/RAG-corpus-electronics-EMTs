The designs typically have three ampliÔ¨Åer gains for detection of short, medium, or maximum range targets,
plus a squelch circuit so that sudden spurious signals will not be counted. The Doppler signal is integrated and
this direct current provides a speed readout. Provision is made for calibration to assure the accuracy of the readings.
