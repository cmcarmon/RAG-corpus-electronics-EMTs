Different  types  of  recording  instruments  obtain  a  temporary  or  permanent  record  of  the  EEG.  The  most
common  recording  device  is  a  pen  or  chart  recorder  (usually  multichannel)  that  is  an  integral  part  of  most
commercially available EEG instruments. The bandwidth of clinical EEGs is relatively low (less than 40 Hz)
and  therefore  within  the  frequency  response  capabilities  of  these  devices.  Recordings  are  on  a  long  sheet  of
continuous paper (from a folded stack), fed past the moving pen at one of several selectable constant speeds.
The  paper  speed  translates  into  distance  per  unit  time  or  cycles  per  unit  time,  to  allow  EEG  interpreters  to
identify different frequency components or patterns within the EEG. Paper speed is selected according to the
monitoring  situation  at  hand:  slow  speeds  (10  mm/s)  for  observing  the  spiking  characteristically  associated
with seizures and faster speeds (up to 120 mm/s) for the presence of individual frequency bands in the EEG.
In  addition  to  (or  instead  of)  a  pen  recorder,  the  EEG  may  be  recorded  on  a  multichannel  frequency
modulated (FM) analog tape recorder. During such recordings, a visual output device such as an oscilloscope
or  video  display  is  necessary  to  allow  visual  monitoring  of  signals,  so  that  corrective  action  (reapplying  the
electrodes and so on) can take place immediately if necessary.
