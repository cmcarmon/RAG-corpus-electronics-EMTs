In contrast, slower chips built in earlier times satisfied our lumped matter
discipline more easily. For example, the MIPS microprocessor built in 1984 was
implemented on a chip that was 1 cm on a side. It ran at a speed of 20 MHz,
which translates to a cycle time of 50 ns. The wave propagation delay across
the chip was 1/15 ns, which was significantly smaller then the chip cycle time.
As another example, a Pentium II chip built in 1998 clocked at 400 MHz,
but used a chip size that was more or less the same as that of the MIPS
chip
namely, about 1 cm on a side. As calculated earlier, the wave propaga-
tion delay across a 1-cm chip is about 1/15 ns. Clearly the 2.5-ns cycle time of
the Pentium II chip is still significantly larger than the wave propagation delay
across the chip.
