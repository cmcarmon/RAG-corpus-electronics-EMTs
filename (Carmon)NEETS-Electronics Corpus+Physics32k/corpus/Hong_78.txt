Transistors are active non-linear devices that facilitate signal amplification. In the 
hydrodynamic  model  of  electrical  current,  transistors  are  equivalent  to  a  dam  with  a 
variable gate that controls the amount of water flow shown in Figure 7.1. Just as in a real 
dam, a small amount of energy is required to operate the gate. Amplification is achieved 
in  the  sense  that  a  small  amount  of  energy  can  be  used  to  control  the  flow  of  a  large 
amount of current.
