The convergence of this algorithm is slow because usually 10
to 15 WLS designs are required in practice to approximate the
Chebyshev solution. An efÔ¨Åciently accelerated algorithm was
presented by Lim et al. (1992) that is characterized by the
weight matrix W k whose elements are recurrently updated by:
