as white noise. Unvoiced waveforms are usually lower in
energy than voiced utterances, and their noisy character neces-
sitates modeling them as stochastic processes. In addition,
some sounds are created using mixed voiced and unvoiced
excitations. Examples of voiced and unvoiced sounds are given
below. The sound made by the letter z in zoo (denoted =z= by
phoneticians) is the result of mixed excitation.
