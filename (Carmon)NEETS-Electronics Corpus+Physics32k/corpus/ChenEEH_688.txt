Because these principles distribute the power consumption
from a few ‘‘hot spots’’ to all parts of the architecture (Itoh
et al., 1997), the end result is indeed a very optimized design
for power where every piece consumes about an equal amount.
An explicit power distribution is provided by Seki et al. (1993):
47% for everything to do with address selection and buffering
(several subparts), 15% in the cells, 15% in the data line and
sensing, and 23% in the output buffer.
