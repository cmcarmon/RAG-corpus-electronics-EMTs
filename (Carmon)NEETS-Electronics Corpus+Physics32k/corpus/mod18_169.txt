Surface-search radar is used to detect the presence of surface craft and low flying aircraft and to
determine their presence. Shipboard surface-search radar provides this type of information as an input to
the weapons system to assist in the engagement of hostile targets by fire-control radar. Shipboard surface-
search radar is also used extensively as a navigational aid in coastal waters and in poor weather
conditions. A typical surface-search radar antenna is shown in figure 1-24.
