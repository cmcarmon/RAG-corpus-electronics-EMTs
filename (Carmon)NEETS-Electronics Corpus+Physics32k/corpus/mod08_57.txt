The classification of an amplifier as a voltage or power amplifier is made by comparing the 
characteristics of the input and output signals. If the output signal is larger in voltage amplitude than the 
input signal, the amplifier is a voltage amplifier. If there is no voltage gain, but the output power is greater 
than the input power, the amplifier is a power amplifier.
