The 3-ring release system is a parachute component that is widely used by sport skydivers and military freefall parachutists to attach the two risers of a main parachute to the harness that bears the load under the parachute.
Invented in its original large ring form by Bill Booth, and subsequently scaled down for thinner Type 17 webbing risers the three-ring system allows a skydiver to quickly cut-away a malfunctioning main parachute with a single motion. Skydivers usually need to do this quickly during emergencies in which they need to deploy a reserve parachute. The three-ring system is simple, inexpensive, reliable, and requires fewer operations than earlier parachute release systems while reducing the physical force needed.
The large bottom ring is securely attached to the skydiver's harness, the middle ring is securely attached to the end of the parachute riser, and the small ring is securely attached to the parachute riser above the middle ring. The middle ring is passed through the large ring and looped upwards; the small ring is then passed through the middle ring and looped upwards. Continuing in the same manner, a cord loop is passed through the small ring, loop upwards, and finally passes through a grommet to the opposing side of the parachute riser. A semi-rigid cable attached to a release handle then passes through this loop, securing the loop. Releasing the cord loop by removing the cable with a tug causes the three-ring system to cascade free and quickly disconnect the riser from the harness.
Each ring in the series multiplies the mechanical advantage of the loop of cord that is held in place by the semi-rigid cable (a Lolon-F or Teflon impregnated plastic coated steel cable, depending on manufacturer).
