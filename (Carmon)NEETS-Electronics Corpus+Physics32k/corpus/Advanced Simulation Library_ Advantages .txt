C++ API (no OpenCL knowledge required)
Mesh-free, immersed boundary approach allows users to move from CAD directly to computations reducing pre-processing effort
Dynamic compilation enables an additional layer of optimization at run-time (i.e. for a specific parameters set the application was provided with)
Automatic hardware acceleration and parallelization of applications
Deployment of same program on a variety of parallel architectures - GPU, APU, FPGA, DSP, multicore CPUs
Ability to deal with complex boundaries
Ability to incorporate microscopic interactions
