Energy Bands
In crystalline semiconductors atoms are arranged in periodic arrays known as crystalline lattices. The lattice
structure of silicon is shown in Fig. 22.1. Germanium and diamond have the same structure but with different
interatomic  distances. As  a  consequence  of  this  periodic  arrangement,  the  allowed  energy  levels  of  electrons
 as shown in Fig. 22.2. The probability that an electron will occupy an allowed
are grouped into 
quantum state with energy
