In 1991, the worldwide market for CRT monitors was 37 million units [Stanford Resources, 1992a], of which
20 million units were high-resolution color monitors. These 37 million do not take into account the oscilloscope,
radar, projection, and other special-purpose tubes that would add a few hundred thousand to the Ô¨Ågures. In
1996, high resolution color CRT monitors in current use are in excess of 200 million units and mroe than 50
million monitors are being produced.
