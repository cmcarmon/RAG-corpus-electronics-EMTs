Voltmeter sensitivity is expressed in ohms per volt ( W /V). It is the resistance of the voltmeter at the
full-scale reading in volts. Since the voltmeter’s resistance does not change with the position of the
pointer, the total resistance of the meter is the sensitivity multiplied by the full-scale voltage reading. The
higher the sensitivity of a voltmeter, the higher the voltmeter’s resistance. Since high resistance voltmeters
