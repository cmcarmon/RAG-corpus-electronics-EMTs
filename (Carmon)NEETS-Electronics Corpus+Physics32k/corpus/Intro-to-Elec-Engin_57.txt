The Biot–Savart law can be extended to ﬁnd the magnetic ﬂux density due to a current-
carrying ﬁlamentary wire of any length and shape by dividing the wire into a number of
inﬁnitesimal elements and using superposition. The net force experienced by a current loop can
be similarly evaluated by superposition.
