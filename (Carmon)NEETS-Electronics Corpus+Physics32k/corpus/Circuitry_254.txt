Transistors designed specifically for audio and low-frequency linear applications 
(below 100 kHz) 
Transistors designed specifically for radio and wideband linear applications  
(100 kHz and above) 
Transistors that operate at significant power levels (such devices are often sub-
divided into audio and radio frequency types) 
Transistors designed for switching applications (including power switching) 
Transistors that have low-noise characteristics and which are intended primarily for 
the amplification of low-amplitude signals  
Transistors designed specifically to handle high voltages 
Transistors that operate at medium power and voltage levels and which are often 
used to precede a final (power) stage which operates at an appreciable power level
