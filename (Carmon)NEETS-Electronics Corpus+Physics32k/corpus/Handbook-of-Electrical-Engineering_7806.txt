Another track format used in practice is based on the sampled-servo concept. Here the tracks are identiﬁed
by occasional marks placed permanently on the substrate at regular intervals, as shown in Fig. 80.23. Details
of  track  following  by  the  sampled-servo  scheme  will  follow  shortly;  sufﬁce  it  to  say  at  this  point  that  servo
marks help the system identify the position of the focused spot relative to the track center. Once the position
is determined it is fairly simple to steer the beam and adjust its position.
