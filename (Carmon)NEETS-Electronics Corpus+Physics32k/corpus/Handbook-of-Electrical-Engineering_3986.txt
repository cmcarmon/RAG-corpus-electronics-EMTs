FIGURE 39.11 Electron velocity versus electric ﬁeld for several semiconductors. This ﬁgure shows the electron velocity in
several common semiconductors as a funcation of electric ﬁeld strength. At low electric ﬁeld the electron velocity is ohmic,
as indicated by the linear characteristic. At higher electric ﬁeld strength the electron velocity saturates and becomes nonlinear.
Compound semiconductors such as GaAs and InP have highly nonlinear behavior at large electric ﬁelds.
