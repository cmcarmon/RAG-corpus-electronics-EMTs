Notice in particular the vector diagrams for T3 and T7. At T3, all three waves, and therefore all three 
vectors, are in phase. The modulation envelope at this instant must, therefore, be equal to twice the 
amplitude of the carrier since each sideband frequency has one-half the amplitude of the carrier.
