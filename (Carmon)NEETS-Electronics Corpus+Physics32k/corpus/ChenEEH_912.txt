Note that any minimal set of linearly independent clock
skews must not contain a cycle (as deÔ¨Åned by equation 4.24),
for if the set contains a cycle, the skews in the set would not be
linearly independent. Furthermore, any such set must span all
vertices (registers) of the circuit, or it is not possible to express
the clock skews of any paths in and out of the vertices not
spanned by the set. Given a circuit C with r registers and p local
data paths, these conclusions are formally summarized in the
following two results from graph theory (West, 1996; Reingold
et al., 1997):
