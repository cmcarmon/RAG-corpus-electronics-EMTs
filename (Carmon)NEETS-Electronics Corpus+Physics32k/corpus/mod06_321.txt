In effect, the area between the grid and cathode becomes highly negatively charged, as shown in
view D. This negative charge is surrounded by an electrostatic field. The electrostatic field cuts the grid
and repels electrons that are present in the grid. As electrons are forced from the grid, the grid tries to go
positive. Unfortunately, this tendency toward a positive charge attracts electrons from the mass or
bunched charge. Thus, as an electron is forced from the grid; it is replaced by another from the massed
charge. Electrons forced from the grid represent grid current (Ig), as shown in view E. The grid current
flows from the grid through Rg, to the cathode, from the cathode, to the massed charged, and back again
to the grid, The movement of current in this manner is, in effect, a path for current flow from the cathode
to the grid. Because current flows between the cathode and grid, the resistance (rgk) between these
elements is lowered to the point of a short circuit. The grid, in effect, is short circuited to the cathode and
ceases to function; and this, in turn, lowers tube efficiency dramatically. This is shown in view F of figure
2-9.
