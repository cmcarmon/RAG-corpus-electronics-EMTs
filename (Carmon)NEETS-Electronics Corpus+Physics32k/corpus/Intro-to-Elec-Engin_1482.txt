Mobil Radio Systems (Cellular Telephone Systems)
Today radio-based systems make it possible for mobile people to communicate via cellular
telephone systems while traveling on airplanes and motor vehicles. For radio telephone service,
the FCC in the United States has assigned parts of the UHF band in the range of 806–890 MHz.
For efﬁcient use of the available frequency spectrum, especially in highly populated metropolitan
areas with the greatest demand for mobile telephone services, the cellular radio concept has been
adopted, in which a geographic area is subdivided into cells, each of which contains a base station,
as shown in Figure 15.2.31. Each base station is connected by telephone lines to a mobile telephone
switching ofﬁce (MTSO), which in turn is connected through telephone lines to a telephone central
ofﬁce of the terrestrial telephone network.
