The phrase integration test is used to deﬁne a recurring series of tests that occur when components or modules
of  an  evolving  software  product  are  added  to  the  fundamental  system.  The  purpose  of  integration  testing  is  to
ensure that the newer portions of the product can interact and operate safely with the existing portions. The observed
removal  efﬁciency  of  integration  testing  is  normally  in  the  20  to  35%  range.  When  performed  by  commercial
software producers, integration test is normally carried out by testing specialists supported by fairly powerful tools.
The  phrase  system  test  is  used  to  deﬁne  the  ﬁnal,  internal  testing  stage  of  a  complete  product  before  it  is
released to customers. The test suites that are executed during system test will include both special tests created
for system test and also regression tests drawn from the product’s test library. The observed removal efﬁciency
of  system  testing  is  in  the  25  to  35%  range  when  such  testing  is  done  by  the  developers  themselves.  When
system testing is carried out by testing specialists for commercial software, its defect removal efﬁciency may
achieve levels approaching 50%. However, high defect removal efﬁciency this late in a development cycle often
leads to alarming schedule slippages.
