In electronics, a prototype refers to build a working 
example of an electronic circuit. Before building a 
prototype, there are several steps that must take place 
first. To develop a new electronic circuit means it must 
serve a need or a want. Ideas that could lead to innova-
tion include the following:
	● Combining different circuits to create a new circuit
	● Creating a new approach to a circuit design
	● Developing a do-nothing circuit
	● Improving on a circuit that already exists
	● Solving a problem that exists
	● Targeting a specific problem
