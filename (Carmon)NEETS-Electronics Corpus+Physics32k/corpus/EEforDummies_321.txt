This is analogous to water flowing through a pipe of a certain diameter. If 
you exert a certain water pressure on the water in the pipe, the current will 
flow at a certain rate. If you increase the water pressure, the current will flow 
faster through that same pipe, and if you decrease the water pressure, the 
current will flow slower through the pipe.
