Collision (or terminating singular) orbits are subset of singular orbits formed when the swinging mass is ejected from the its pivot with an initial velocity, such that it returns to the pivot (i.e. it collides with the pivot):

The simplest case of collision orbits are the ones with a mass ratio of 3, which will always return symmetrically to the origin after being ejected from the origin, and were termed Type B orbits in Tufillaro's initial paper. They were also referred to as teardrop, heart, or rabbit-ear orbits because of their appearance.
When the swinging mass returns to the origin, the counterweight mass,



M


{\displaystyle M}
must instantaneously change direction, causing an infinite tension in the connecting string. Thus we may consider the motion to terminate at this time.
