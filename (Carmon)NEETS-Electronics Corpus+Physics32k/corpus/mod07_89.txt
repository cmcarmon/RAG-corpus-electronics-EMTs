The energy diagram for the insulator shows the insulator with a very wide energy gap. The wider this
gap, the greater the amount of energy required to move the electron from the valence band to the
conduction band. Therefore, an insulator requires a large amount of energy to obtain a small amount of
current. The insulator "insulates" because of the wide forbidden band or energy gap.
