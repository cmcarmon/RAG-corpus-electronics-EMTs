Thus, the total signal-related power in ˜r (t) is α2Ac
power (m). The noise power equals the integral of the
2
noise power spectrum; because the power spectrum is constant over the transmission band, this integral
equals the noise amplitude N0 times the ﬁlter’s bandwidth 2W . The so-called received signal-to-noise
ratio — the signal-to-noise ratio after the de rigeur front-end bandpass ﬁlter and before demodulation —
equals
