Recent developments in small scale mechanical testing, with sub-nm resolution in displacement and sub-μN resolution in force, now allow to directly study discrete events in stress and strain. Currently, the most prominent method is a miniaturized compression experiment, where a nanoindenter equipped with a flat indentation tip is used. Equipped with in-situ techniques in combination with Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and micro-diffraction methods, this nanomechanical testing method can give us rich detail in nanoscale plasticity instabilities in real time.
One potential concern in nanomechanical measurement is: how fast can the system respond? Can indentation tip remain contact with the sample and track the deformation? Since dislocation velocity is strongly effected by stress, velocity can be many orders different in different systems. Also, multiscale nature of dislocation avalanche event gives dislocation velocity a large range. For example, single dislocations have been shown to move at speeds of ∼10 ms−1 in pure Cu, but dislocation groups moved with ∼10−6 ms−1 in Cu-0.5%Al. The opposite is found for iron, where dislocation groups are found to move six orders of magnitude faster in a FeSi-alloy than individual dislocations in pure iron.
To resolve this issue, Sparks et al. has designed an experiment to measure first fracture of Si beam and compare with theoretical prediction to determine the respond speed of the system. In addition to regular compression experiments, in-situ electrical contact resistance measurements (ECR) were performed. During these in-situ tests, a constant voltage was applied during the deformation experiment to record current evolution during intermittent plastic flow. Result shows that indentation tip remains contact with the sample throughout experiments, which proves the respond speed is fast enough.
