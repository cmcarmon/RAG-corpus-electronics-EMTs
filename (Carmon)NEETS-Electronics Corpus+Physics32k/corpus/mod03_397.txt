Circuit breakers require careful inspection and periodic cleaning. Before you attempt to work on
circuit breakers, check the applicable technical manual carefully. When you work on shipboard circuit
breakers, the approval of the electrical or engineering officer must be obtained before starting work. Be
certain to remove all power to the circuit breaker before you work on it. Tag the switch that removes the
power to the circuit breaker to ensure that power is not applied while you are working.
