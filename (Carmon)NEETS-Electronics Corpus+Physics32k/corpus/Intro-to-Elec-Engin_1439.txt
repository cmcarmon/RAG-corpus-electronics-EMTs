Message Demodulation
The major advantage of the conventional (standard) DSB AM signal transmission is the ease with
which the signal can be demodulated. The message signal is received by passing the rectiﬁed signal
through a low-pass ﬁlter whose bandwidth matches that of the message signal. The combination of
the rectiﬁer and the low-pass ﬁlter is known as an envelope detector, which is almost universally
used. A standard AM envelope detector consisting of a diode and an RC circuit (which is basically
a simple low-pass ﬁlter) and its response are shown in Figure 15.2.8.
