Another type of parallel line is the TWO-WIRE RIBBON (TWIN LEAD) illustrated in figure 3-3.
This type of transmission line is commonly used to connect a television receiving antenna to a home
television set. This line is essentially the same as the two-wire open line except that uniform spacing is
assured by embedding the two wires in a low-loss dielectric, usually polyethylene. Since the wires are
embedded in the thin ribbon of polyethylene, the dielectric space is partly air and partly polyethylene.
