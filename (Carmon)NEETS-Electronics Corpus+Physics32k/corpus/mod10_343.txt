SUDDEN IONOSPHERIC DISTURBANCES.â€”The most startling of the ionospheric 
irregularities is known as a SUDDEN IONOSPHERIC DISTURBANCE (sid). These disturbances may 
occur without warning and may prevail for any length of time, from a few minutes to several hours. When 
sid occurs, long distance propagation of hf radio waves is almost totally "blanked out." The immediate 
effect is that radio operators listening on normal frequencies are inclined to believe their receivers have 
gone dead.
