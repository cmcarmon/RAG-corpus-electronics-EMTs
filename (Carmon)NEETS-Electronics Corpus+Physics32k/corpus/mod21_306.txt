The comparing circuit contains branches A and B and has provisions for changing the ratios of the 
branches with respect to each other, which enables various measuring ranges to be obtained. Comparison 
of figures 3-1 and 3-2 shows that either or both branches of the comparing circuit do not necessarily 
contain resistors alone. Branch B of the Hay bridge, containing CB and RB in series connection, provides a 
striking contrast with the parallel connection of CB and RB of the Maxwell bridge.
