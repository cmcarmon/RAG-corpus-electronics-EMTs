storage takes place in the ‘‘cell.’’ This access structure, which
includes the ‘‘selection’’ part and the ‘‘input/output’’ part,
dominates the overall cost in terms of power, speed, and
throughput. When power-sensitive memories are constructed,
the area contribution also becomes more balanced between the
heavily distributed memory matrices and the access structures.
