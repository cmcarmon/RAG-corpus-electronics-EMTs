If we are interested in signal speeds that are comparable to the speed of
electromagnetic waves, then the lumped matter discipline is violated, and there-
fore we cannot use the lumped circuit abstraction. Instead, we must resort
to distributed circuit models based on elements such as transmission lines
and waveguides.12 In these distributed elements, the voltages and currents
at any instant of time are a function of the location within the elements. The
treatment of distributed elements are beyond the scope of this book.
