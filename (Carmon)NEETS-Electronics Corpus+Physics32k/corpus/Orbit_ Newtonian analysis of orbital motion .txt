(See also Kepler orbit, orbit equation and Kepler's first law.)
The Earth follows an ellipse round the sun. But unlike the ellipse followed by a pendulum or an object attached to a spring, the sun is at a focal point of the ellipse and not at its centre.
The following derivation applies to such an elliptical orbit. We start only with the Newtonian law of gravitation stating that the gravitational acceleration towards the central body is related to the inverse of the square of the distance between them, namely
eq 1.

G

m

r

{\displaystyle F_{2}=-{\frac {Gm_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}}}

Where F2 is the force acting on the mass m2 caused by the gravitational attraction mass m1 has for m2, G is the universal gravitational constant, and r is the distance between the two masses centers.
From Newton's Second Law, the summation of the forces acting on m2 related to that bodies acceleration:
eq 2.

A

{\displaystyle F_{2}=m_{2}A_{2}}

Where A2 is the acceleration of m2 caused by the force of gravitational attraction F2 of m1 acting on m2.

is the standard gravitational parameter, in this case

We assume that the central body is massive enough that it can be considered to be stationary and we ignore the more subtle effects of general relativity.
When a pendulum or an object attached to a spring swings in an ellipse, the inward acceleration/force is proportional to the distance

Then the vector to the orbiting object is

We can multiply through by



r


{\displaystyle r}
because it is not zero unless the orbiting object crashes. Then having the derivative be zero gives that the function is a constant.

which is actually the theoretical proof of Kepler's second law (A line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time). The constant of integration, h, is the angular momentum per unit mass.
In order to get an equation for the orbit from equation (1), we need to eliminate time. (See also Binet equation.) In polar coordinates, this would express the distance



r


{\displaystyle r}
of the orbiting object from the center as a function of its angle



θ

. However, it is easier to introduce the auxiliary variable

So for the gravitational force – or, more generally, for any inverse square force law – the right hand side of the equation becomes a constant and the equation is seen to be the harmonic equation (up to a shift of origin of the dependent variable). The solution is:
