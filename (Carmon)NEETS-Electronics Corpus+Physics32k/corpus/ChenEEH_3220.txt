The advantages of the breaker-and-a-half scheme include
(a) most ï¬‚exible operation, (b) high reliability, (c) breaker
failure of bus side breakers removing only one circuit from
service, (d) all switching being performed with breakers,
(e) simple operation without disconnect switching for normal
operation, (f) the ability of either main bus to be taken out of
service at any time for maintenance, and (g) no removal of
any feeder circuits, from service during bus failure. Disadvan-
tages include 1.5 breakers per circuit and relaying and
automatic reclosing that are somewhat involved because the
middle breaker must be responsive to either of its associated
circuits.
