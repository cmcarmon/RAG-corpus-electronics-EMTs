The values of resistors R4–R10 have been carefully calculated to produce 
the correct tones. For instance, the frequency of the note A on the equal‐
tempered scale is 440 Hz. The resistance you need between pins 7 and 2 to 
produce a 440 Hz pulse train is roughly 15.1 kΩ. (You can calculate this resis-
tance yourself by using the formula in Chapter 11 for the frequency of a pulse 
train produced by the 555 timer used as an astable multivibrator.) By press-
ing SW3, you are connecting resistors R2, R3, R4, and R5 in series between 
pins 7 and 2. (Be sure to follow the path of the complete circuit and see for 
yourself what the total resistance is.) The total resistance (R2+R3+R4+R5) is 
12.6 kΩ plus the value of the 10 kΩ pot (that is, R3). If your circuit is tuned 
properly (by adjusting the pot while using a tuning fork or your accurately 
tuned piano, if you like), the pot value is roughly 2.5 kΩ. (Keep in mind that 
resistor values can vary, so your pot value may be a little higher or lower 
than 2.5 kΩ.)
