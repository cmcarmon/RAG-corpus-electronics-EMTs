Often used in disc brakes, the brake caliper assembly consists of one to two hollow aluminum or chrome-plated steel pistons (caliper pistons). Brake calipers are one of the most important parts of a vehicle and are essential for your car's ability to stop.The job of the caliper is to slow the car's wheels using the friction they create with metal disks (rotors). They work by taking the pressure given by the master cylinder to force the pistons against the rotor. The development and use of disc-type brakes began in England in the 1890s. The first caliper-type automobile disc brake was patented by Frederick William Lanchester in his Birmingham factory in 1902. In a disc-braking system the rotors are attached to the car's wheels and spin together.
