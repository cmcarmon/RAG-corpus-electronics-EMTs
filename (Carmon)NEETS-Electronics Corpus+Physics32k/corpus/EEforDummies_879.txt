▶✓ Soldering stand: The stand holds the soldering iron and keeps the  
very hot tip from coming into contact with anything on your work 
 surface. Some soldering irons come with stands. (Usually, these 
combos are known as soldering stations.) The stand should have a 
weighted base; if not, clamp it to your worktable so it doesn’t tip over. 
A stand is a must‐have — unless you want to burn your project, your 
desk, or yourself!
