Thus, in general, the instantaneous power for sinusoidal drive has a sinusoidal
component at twice the frequency of the input signal, and the DC component.
We will examine this expression for some simple cases shortly, but first let us
complete the general derivation by calculating the average power, because this
is the quantity that determines your monthly bill from the power company.
