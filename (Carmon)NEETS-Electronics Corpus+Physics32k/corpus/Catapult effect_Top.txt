In electromagnetics, the catapult effect is a phenomenon occurring when a current is passed through two wires connected by a loose wire in a magnetic field. The loose wire is then catapulted horizontally away from the magnetic field. This occurs due to the magnetic forces acting in the wires and in the magnetic field itself.
