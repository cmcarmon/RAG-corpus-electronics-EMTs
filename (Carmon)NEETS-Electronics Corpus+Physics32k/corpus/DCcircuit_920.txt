Such demanding precision calls for a bridge measurement circuit. Unlike the Wheatstone
bridge shown in the last chapter using a null-balance detector and a human operator to main-
tain a state of balance, a strain gauge bridge circuit indicates measured strain by the degree
of imbalance, and uses a precision voltmeter in the center of the bridge to provide an accurate
measurement of that imbalance:
