7.9.1 Delay Circuits
An  RC circuit  can  be  used  to  provide  various  time  delays.  Figure  7.73
shows such a circuit. It basically consists of an RC circuit with the capac-
itor connected in parallel with a neon lamp. The voltage source can pro-
vide  enough  voltage  to  ﬁre  the  lamp.  When  the  switch  is  closed,  the
capacitor voltage increases gradually toward 110 V at a rate determined
The lamp will act as an open
by the circuit’s time constant,
