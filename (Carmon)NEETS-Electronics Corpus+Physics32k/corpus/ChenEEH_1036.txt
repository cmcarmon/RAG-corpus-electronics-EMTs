If both the technology and architecture are ﬁxed, the deter-
mining factor in power dissipation is timing: at higher volt-
ages, the circuits operate faster but use more energy. Some
techniques adjust the circuit during operation to achieve
power savings. For example, with the use of a dynamically
adjustable power supplies technique (Gutnik and Chandra-
ksan, 1997), power can be reduced substantially without sacri-
ﬁcing performance
in ﬁxed-throughput applications by
slowing the clock and lowering the supply voltage instead of
