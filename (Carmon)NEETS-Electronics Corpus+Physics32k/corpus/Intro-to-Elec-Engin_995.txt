Figure 12.2.2 shows an elementary single-phase synchronous machine with four salient poles;
the ﬂux paths are shown by dashed lines. Two complete wavelengths (or cycles) exist in the
ﬂux distribution around the periphery, since the ﬁeld coils are connected so as to form poles of
alternate north and south polarities. The armature winding now consists of two coils (a1,−a1)
