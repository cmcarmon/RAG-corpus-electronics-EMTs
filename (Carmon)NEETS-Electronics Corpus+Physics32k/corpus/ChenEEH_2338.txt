. The operation mode represents the ﬁeld distribution of
the guide and, more speciﬁcally, the type of ﬁeld distri-
bution. If both the electric and magnetic ﬁeld compon-
ents are zero in the direction of propagation, the mode is
called transverse electromagnetic (TEM waves). If only
the electric ﬁeld is zero in the direction of propagation of
the guide, then the mode is called transverse electric
(TE wave); it is called transverse magnetic (TM) if the
magnetic ﬁeld is zero in the direction of propagation. In
some cases, the ﬁeld is a combination of the two (TE and
TM). For such a case, the mode is referred to as a hybrid
mode.
