The subject is seated in front of the drum and the following instructions are imparted to him.
This is a learning experiment and you will be shown a list of meaningful words and later on, a list of nonsense syllable. You will learn by heart with full concentration.
First the list of meaningful words will be shown to you at 2 seconds intervals through the window memory drum.
After the list has been shown once, you will be required to write the list in the same order.
If there are spelling mistakes or the orders of the words are not maintained, again the list will be shown to you. After the list is over you will again reproduce the list.
The experiment will continue till you are able to reproduce the list of 3 times in the same order consecutively. After your successful reproduction you will be given a 30 minutes rest pause.
After the pause, the experiment will be repeated with the list of nonsense syllables. In the end you will record your subjective report regarding the experiment.
