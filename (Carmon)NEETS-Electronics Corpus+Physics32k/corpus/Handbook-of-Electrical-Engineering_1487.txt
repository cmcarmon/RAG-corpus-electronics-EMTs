1. Word boundaries are unclear in continuous speech, whereas in isolated word recognition they are well-
known and can be used to improve the accuracy and limit the search. For example, in the phrase “this
ship,”  the  /s/  of “this”  is  often  omitted.  Similarly,  in “we  were  away  a  year,”  the  whole  sentence  is  one
long vocalic segment, and the word boundaries are difﬁcult to locate.
