The two-state nature of digital technology makes the binary number system its natural tool.
In a binary system there are only two digits, namely, 0 and 1. The vast majority of present digital
computers use the binary system, which has two binary digits (bits), 0 and 1. Internal representation
of information in a digital computer is in groups of bits. Besides the binary system (base 2), in
the digital world, the most commonly used number systems are octal (base 8) and hexadecimal
(base 16).
