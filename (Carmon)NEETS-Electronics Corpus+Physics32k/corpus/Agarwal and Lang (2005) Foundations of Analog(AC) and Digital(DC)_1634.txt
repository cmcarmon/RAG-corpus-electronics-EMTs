CMOS logic makes use of a complementary MOSFET called the
p-channel MOSFET or the PFET.5 The n-channel MOSFET that we have
dealt with thus far is called an NFET. The symbols and the SR circuit models
for the NFET and PFET are shown in Figures 11.15 and 11.16, respectively.
As we saw previously in Section 6.6, the NFET turns on when its vGS â‰¥ VTn.
