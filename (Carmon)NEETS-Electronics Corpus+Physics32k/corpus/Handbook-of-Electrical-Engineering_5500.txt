The term compensation is used to describe the intentional insertion of reactive power-producing devices, either
capacitive or inductive, to achieve a desired effect in the electric power system. The effects include improved
voltage proÔ¨Åles, enhanced stability performance, and improved transmission capacity. The devices are connected
either in series or in shunt (parallel) at a particular point in the power circuit.
