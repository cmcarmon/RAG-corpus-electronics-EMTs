Once a Boolean function is represented in a K map and its different subcubes are formed,
that Boolean function can be expressed as the logic SOP terms corresponding to the minimum
set of subcubes that cover all its 1 cells. Obviously then, in forming a subcube, one should not
select a subcube that is totally contained in another subcube. The product term representing the
subcube containing the maximum possible number of adjacent 1 cells in the map is called a prime
implicant. A prime implicant is known as an essential prime implicant if the subcube represented
by the prime implicant contains at least one 1 cell that is not covered by any other subcube. If,
on the other hand, all the 1 cells of a subcube of a prime implicant are covered by some other
subcubes, then such a prime implicant is known as an optional prime implicant. The minimized
Boolean expression is obtained by the logic sum (OR) of all the essential prime implicants and
some other optional prime implicants that cover any remaining 1 cells that are not covered by the
essential prime implicants.
