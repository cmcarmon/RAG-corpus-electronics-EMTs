Herglotz defined this class in terms of equidistant curves which are the orthogonal trajectories of a family of hyperplanes, which also can be seen as solutions of a Riccati equation (this was called "plane motion" by Salzmann & Taub or "irrotational rigid motion" by Boyer). He concluded, that the motion of such a body is completely determined by the motion of one of its points.
The general metric for these irrotational motions has been given by Herglotz, whose work was summarized with simplified notation by Lemaître (1924). Also the Fermi metric in the form given by Christian Møller (1952) for rigid frames with arbitrary motion of the origin was identified as the "most general metric for irrotational rigid motion in special relativity". In general, it was shown that irrotational Born motion corresponds to those Fermi congruences of which any worldline can be used as baseline (homogeneous Fermi congruence).
Already Born (1909) pointed out that a rigid body in translational motion has a maximal spatial extension depending on its acceleration, given by the relation

{\displaystyle b<c^{2}/R}
, where



b


{\displaystyle b}
is the proper acceleration and



R


{\displaystyle R}
is the radius of a sphere in which the body is located, thus the higher the proper acceleration, the smaller the maximal extension of the rigid body. The special case of translational motion with constant proper acceleration is known as hyperbolic motion, with the worldline
