where ke is a constant dependent on the characteristics of iron, V is the volume of iron, f is the
frequency, τ is the lamination thickness (usually a stack of thin laminations makes up the core),
and Bm is the maximum core ﬂux density. By choosing very thin laminations (making τ smaller),
the eddy-current loss can be reduced.
