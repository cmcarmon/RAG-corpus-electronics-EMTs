The Laser Industry
Commercial Lasers
There is a big difference between the world of laser research and the world of the commercial laser industry.
Unfortunately, many text and reference books fail to differentiate between types of lasers that can be built in
the laboratory and those that are readily available commercially. That distinction is a crucial one for laser users.
Laser  emission  has  been  obtained  from  hundreds  of  materials  at  many  thousands  of  emission  lines  in
laboratories around the world. Extensive tabulations of these laser lines are available [Weber, 1982], and even
today researchers are adding more lines to the list. However, most of these laser lines are of purely academic
interest. Many are weak lines close to much stronger lines that dominate the emission in practical lasers. Most
of the lasers that have been demonstrated in the laboratory have proved to be cumbersome to operate, low in
power, inefÔ¨Åcient, and/or simply less practical to use than other types.
