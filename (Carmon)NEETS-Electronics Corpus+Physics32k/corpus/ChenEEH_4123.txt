of phase transition is 08 and 908 and occurs twice as often but
with half the intensity of the quadrature phase shift keying
system. Comparing Figure 4.4 with Figure 4.7, notice that the
Q signal is the same for both QPSK and OQPSK, but the I
signal is delayed by 1/2 bit. Thus, the 1808 phase change at the
end of bit interval 4 of the QPSK signal is replaced by a 908
phase change at the end of bit interval 4 of the OQPSK signal.
Also notice that phase changes occur more frequently with
OQPSK. Although the phase changes will still cause amplitude
ﬂuctuations to occur in the transmitter and receiver, they have
a smaller magnitude. The bit error rate and bandwidth efﬁ-
ciency of QPSK and OQPSK is the same as for BPSK.
