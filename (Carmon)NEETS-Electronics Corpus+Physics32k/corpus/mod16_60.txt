Two SPECIAL CALIBRATION labels are shown in view C of figure 1-1 that have black lettering
and a yellow background; the size and content of the labels are different. A SPECIAL CALIBRATION
tag (figure 1-1, view C) is used with the smaller of the two labels. These labels or tag are used when some
unusual or special condition in the calibration should be drawn to your attention.
