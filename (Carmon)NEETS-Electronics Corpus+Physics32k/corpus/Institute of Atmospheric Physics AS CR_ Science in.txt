Scientific investigation for the IAP is defined by the vertical extent of the atmosphere. Types of investigations include theoretical models, numerical simulation, and experiment for the Earth's boundary layer, troposphere, middle atmosphere, ionosphere and magnetosphere.
The main research topic areas currently include mesoscale, dynamical, and applied meteorology. Furthermore, the processes of the atmospheric boundary layer are also of interest. In addition, climate variability and climate change are studied. Other research is conducted that concerns the ozone, along with the previously mentioned ionosphere and magnetosphere. Regarding these upper atmosphere domains, the IAP conducts its own satellite experiments. Other research extends into space plasma physics and solar-terrestrial interactions.
