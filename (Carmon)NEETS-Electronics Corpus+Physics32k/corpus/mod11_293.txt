Bearing and elevation angles are determined by measuring the angular position of the radar antenna 
(the transmitted beam) when it is pointing directly at the target. Range is more difficult to determine 
because it cannot be directly measured. The radar system is designed to measure range as a function of 
time. Since the speed of electromagnetic energy is the same as the speed of light, range is determined by 
measuring the time required for a pulse of energy to reach the target and return to the radar. Because the 
speed of the pulse is known, the two-way distance can be determined by multiplying the time by the 
speed of travel. The total must be divided by two to obtain the one-way range because the time value used 
initially is the time required for the pulse to travel to the target and return.
