Bus is a set of conductors (wires, PCB tracks, or connections in
an integrated circuit) connecting various functional units in a
computer. Busses can be either inside or outside the CPU. The
outside busses are used to connect the CPU to external
memory and peripheral devices. The width of a bus (i.e., the
number of parallel connectors) determines the size in bits of
the largest data item that it can carry. The bus width and the
number of data items per second that it can transmit are
factors limiting a computerâ€™s performance. Most current
microprocessors have 32-bit or 64-bit busses. Some processors
have internal busses, which are wider than their external busses
(usually twice the width). The width of the internal bus,
therefore, affects the speed of all operations and has less effect
on the overall system cost than the width of the external bus.
On the other hand, an interface is a communication channel
for two or more systems. It can be a hardware connector
linking devices or a convention allowing communication be-
tween two software systems. There are often some intermediate
components between the two systems that connect the inter-
faces together. For example, two RS-232 interfaces are con-
nected via a serial cable.
