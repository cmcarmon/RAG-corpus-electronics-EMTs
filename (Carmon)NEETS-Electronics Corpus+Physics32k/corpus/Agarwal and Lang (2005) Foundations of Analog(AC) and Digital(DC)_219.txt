Figure 1.44 shows several examples of analog signals. Figure 1.44b shows
a DC current signal, while the remainder are various forms of voltage signals.
Figure 1.44a shows a sinusoidal signal with frequency 1 MHz and phase
offset (or phase shift) π/4 rad. The same frequency can also be expressed as
106 Hz, or 2π106 rad/s, and the phase offset as 45 degrees. The reciprocal of
the frequency gives the period of oscillation or the cycle time, which is 1 µs
for our sinusoid. Our sinusoid has an average value of zero. This signal can be
described as a sinusoid with an amplitude (or magnitude, or maximum value)
of 10 V, or equivalently as a sinusoid with a peak-to-peak swing of 20 V.
