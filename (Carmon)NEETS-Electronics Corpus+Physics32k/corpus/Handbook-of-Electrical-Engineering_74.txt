During the next time constant, the capacitor charges to 63.2% of the remaining difference of full value, or
to 86.5% of the full value. The charge on a capacitor can never actually reach 100% but is considered to be
100% after ﬁve time constants. When the voltage is removed, the capacitor discharges to 63.2% of the full value.
Capacitance is expressed in microfarads (mF, or 10–6 F) or picofarads (pF, or 10–12 F) with a stated accuracy
or  tolerance.  Tolerance  may  also  be  stated  as  GMV  (guaranteed  minimum  value),  sometimes  referred  to  as
MRV (minimum rated value).
