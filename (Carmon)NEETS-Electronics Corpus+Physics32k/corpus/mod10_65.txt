In 1967, in honor of the German physicist Heinrich Hertz, the term HERTZ was designated for use
in lieu of the term "cycle per second" when referring to the frequency of radio waves. It may seem
confusing that in one place the term "cycle" is used to designate the positive and negative alternations of a
wave, but in another instance the term "hertz" is used to designate what appears to be the same thing. The
key is the time factor. The term cycle refers to any sequence of events, such as the positive and negative
alternations, comprising one cycle of electrical current. The term hertz refers to the number of
occurrences that take place in one second.
