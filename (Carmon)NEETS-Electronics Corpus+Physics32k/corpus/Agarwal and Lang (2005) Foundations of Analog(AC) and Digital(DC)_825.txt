As shown in Figure 6.17, when the input vIN is high, the MOSFET is in
the ON state (assuming that the high voltage level is above the threshold VT),
thereby pulling the output voltage to a low value.8 In contrast, when the input
is low, the MOSFET is off, and the output is raised to a high value by RL. Here
we see the purpose of the load resistor9 RL
it provides a logical 1 output
when the MOSFET is off. Furthermore, RL is usually chosen to be large so
that the current is limited when the MOSFET is on.10 Because the resistance
