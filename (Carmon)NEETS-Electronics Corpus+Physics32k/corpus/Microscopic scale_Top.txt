The microscopic scale (from Greek: μικρός, mikrós, "small" and σκοπέω, skopéō "look") is the scale of objects and events smaller than those that can easily be seen by the naked eye, requiring a lens or microscope to see them clearly. In physics, the microscopic scale is sometimes considered the scale between the macroscopic and the quantum realm. Microscopic units and measurements are used to classify and describe very small objects. One common microscopic length scale unit is the Micrometer (μm) - one millionth of 1 meter.
