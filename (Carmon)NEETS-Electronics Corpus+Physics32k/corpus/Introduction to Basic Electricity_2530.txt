appear on the trace of the CRT. The display should be sta-
ble and show several cycles at the amplitude indicated by 
the voltage calibrator. The oscilloscope can now be used.
To use the oscilloscope, set the volts/cm selector 
switch to its highest setting. Connect the input signal to 
be observed, and rotate the volts/cm selector switch un-
til the display is approximately two-thirds of the screenâ€™s 
height. Adjust the time-base controls to produce a sta-
ble trace and to select the desired number of cycles.
