vA = A cos(400t) A = 141 kV, L = 0.25 H
This problem examines a simple model of an electric power system. The source vA
represents the generator in the power plant. The inductance L represents the net effect
of all power lines and transformers. The customerâ€™s load is represented by resistance RL
to which the capacitor C is added in parts (b) and (c).
a) No capacitor. RL = 100 . Find the magnitude of vB and the average power
