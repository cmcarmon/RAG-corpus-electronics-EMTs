. Monopulse system: In the lobe switching and conical
scan, tracking radars require several pulses to extract the
error signal. During this interval, if the pulse echoes con-
tain additional modulation components, such as ï¬‚uctuat-
ing RCS, the tracking accuracy will be degraded. In fact,
the angle of arrival of the target echo can be determined
with a single pulse by measuring the relative phase or
relative amplitude of the received echo pulse. Because
information of the angular error is obtained on the basis
of a single pulse, the system is called a monopulse system.
