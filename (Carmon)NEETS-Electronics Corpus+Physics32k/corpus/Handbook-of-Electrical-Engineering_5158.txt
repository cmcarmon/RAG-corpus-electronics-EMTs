Another piezoelectric material recently developed in the NTK Research facility in Japan is a kind of rubber-
based  material  referred  to  as  piezoelectric  rubber.  This  material  is  composed  of  a  base  material  of  synthetic
rubber, namely, chloroben, dispersed with ﬁne particles of a popular piezoelectric ceramic, called PZT (lead
zirconium  titanate).  Piezoelectric  rubber  combines  the  favorable  properties  of  PZT,  namely,  high  sensitivity,
chemical inertness, linearity, and simplicity, with that of the rubber base, namely, ﬂexibility. The main drawback
with the piezoelectric rubber is in making an electrical contact with it. This problem has been circumvented
by the development of a coaxial cable connection that is easier to use [Ting, 1990].
