Most analog voltmeters (that use D’Arsonval meter movements) in common use today are accurate to
approximately – 2% of full-scale reading. Most digital multimeters, as shown in figure 1-4, have a high
input impedance and are not likely to disturb the circuit being tested. The digital multimeter in most cases
provides an accuracy of at least – 0.1%.
