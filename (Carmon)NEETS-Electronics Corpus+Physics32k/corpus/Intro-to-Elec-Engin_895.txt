EXAMPLE 11.2.2
In the magnetic circuit shown in Figure E11.2.2(a) the coil of 500 turns carries a current of 4 A.
The air-gap lengths are g1 = g2 = 0.25 cm and g3 = 0.4 cm. The cross-sectional areas are related
such that A1 = A2 = 0.5A3. The permeability of iron may be assumed to be inﬁnite. Determine
the ﬂux densities B1, B2, and B3 in the gaps g1, g2, and g3, respectively. Neglect leakage and
fringing.
