A simple transistor amplifier that is operated class A is shown in figure 1-4. Since the output signal 
is a 100% (or 360ยบ) copy of the input signal, current in the output circuit must flow for 100% of the input 
signal time. This is the definition of a class A amplifier. Amplifier current flows for 100% of the input 
signal.
