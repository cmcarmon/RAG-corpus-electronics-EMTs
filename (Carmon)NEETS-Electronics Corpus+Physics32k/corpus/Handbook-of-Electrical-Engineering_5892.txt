From a circuit viewpoint, superconducting machines have smaller internal impedance relative to the con-
ventional ones (refer to equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 66.4). Recall that the reactance jXs stems from the fact
that the armature circuits give rise to a magnetic ﬁeld that tends to counter the effect of the rotor winding. In
the conventional design, such a magnetic ﬁeld is enhanced because iron core is used for the rotor and stator
structures;  thus  jXs  is  large.  In  the  superconducting  design,  the  core  is  basically  air;  thus,  jXs  is  smaller.  The
difference is generally a ratio of 5:1 in magnitude. An implication is that, at the same level of output current
Ia and terminal voltage Vt, it requires of the superconducting generator a smaller induced emf EF or, equivalently,
a smaller ﬁeld current.
