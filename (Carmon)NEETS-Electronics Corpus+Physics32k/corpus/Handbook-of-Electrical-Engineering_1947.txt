4 or 2. Let the tasks 
 and 
are executed in time units 
V implies
that the result of the  lth iteration of  U is used for the (l +  i )th iteration of V. The (l +  i )th iteration of V is
executed in time unit N(l + i ) + v. Thus the number of storage units needed in the folded edge corresponding
to the edge  U Ô¨Å  V is
