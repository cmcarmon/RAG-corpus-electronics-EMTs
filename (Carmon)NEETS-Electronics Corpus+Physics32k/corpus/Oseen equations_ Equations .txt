The Oseen equations are, in case of an object moving with a steady flow velocity U through the fluid—which is at rest far from the object—and in a frame of reference attached to the object:

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}-\rho \mathbf {U} \cdot \nabla \mathbf {u} &=-\nabla p\,+\,\mu \nabla ^{2}\mathbf {u} ,\\\nabla \cdot \mathbf {u} &=0,\end{aligned}}}

where
u is the disturbance in flow velocity induced by the moving object, i.e. the total flow velocity in the frame of reference moving with the object is –U+u,
p is the pressure,
ρ is the density of the fluid,
μ is the dynamic viscosity,
∇ is the gradient operator, and
∇2 is the Laplace operator.
The boundary conditions for the Oseen flow around a rigid object are:

with r the distance from the object's center, and p∞ the undisturbed pressure far from the object.
