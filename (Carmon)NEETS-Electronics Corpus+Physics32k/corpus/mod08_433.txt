Figure 3-32 shows a saturable-core reactor that is used to control the intensity of a lamp. Notice that
two coils are wound around a single core. The coil on the left is connected to a rheostat and a battery.
This coil is called the control coil because it is part of the control circuit. The coil on the right is
connected to a lamp (the load) and an a.c. source. This coil is called the load coil because it is part of the
load circuit.
