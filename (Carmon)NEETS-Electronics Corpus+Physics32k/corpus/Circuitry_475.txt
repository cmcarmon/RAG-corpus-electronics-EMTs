Exclusive-OR  gates  will  produce  a  logic  1  output 
whenever either one of the inputs is at logic 1 and 
the other is at logic 0. Exclusive-OR gates produce 
a logic  0  output  whenever  both  inputs  have  the 
same logical state (i.e. when both are at logic 0 or 
both are at logic 1). The Boolean expression for the 
output,  Y, of  an  exclusive-OR  gate  with  inputs,  A
and B, is:
