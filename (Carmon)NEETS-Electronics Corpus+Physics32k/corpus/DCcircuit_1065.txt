Let’s summarize what we know about the circuit thus far. We know that the total current in
this circuit is given by the sum of all the branch voltages divided by their respective resistances.
We also know that the total resistance is found by taking the reciprocal of all the branch
resistance reciprocals. Furthermore, we should be well aware of the fact that total voltage
across all the branches can be found by multiplying total current by total resistance (E=IR).
All we need to do is put together the two equations we had earlier for total circuit current and
total resistance, multiplying them to ﬁnd total voltage:
