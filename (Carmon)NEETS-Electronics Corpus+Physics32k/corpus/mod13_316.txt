First, apply the addend and augend to the A and B inputs. Calculate the output of each full adder
beginning with full adder 1. With A1 and B1 at 1, S1 is 0 and C1 is 1. Since all three inputs (A2, B2, and C1)
to full adder 2 are 1, the output will be 1 at S2 and 1 at C2. The output of the circuit, as you read left to
right, is 1102, the sum of 112 and 112.
