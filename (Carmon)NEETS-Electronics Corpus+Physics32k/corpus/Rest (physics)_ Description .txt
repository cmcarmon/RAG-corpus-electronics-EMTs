In physics, rest is the state of an object being stationary relative to a particular frame of reference or another object; when the position of a body with respect to its surroundings does not change with time it is said to be "at rest". According to the theory of relativity, it is said that an object is "at rest relative to" another. For example, a train decelerates approaching a station and eventually comes to rest alongside the platform. The train can be said to be "at rest with respect to the station", or, as the correct frame of reference is usually implicit and/or provided by context, simply "at rest". In reality, there is nothing at absolute rest. For example, Earth's gravitation constantly pulls objects toward its surface, while Earth is one of the objects the Sun constantly pulls towards itself, causing it to orbit the Sun; the Sun, in turn, orbits the center of the Milky Way; and so on. Two or more than two objects are said to be at rest, if its position with respect to each other is not changing or moving with uniform velocity with respect to each other; rest and motion are relative term.
