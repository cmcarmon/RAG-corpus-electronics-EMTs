T g2(t)dt varies from one symbol period of length
T to the next. Consequently, the samples of the observation signal zi corresponding to symbols “0” and “1” are
clustered with non-zero variance about –180 and +180, respectively. Thus, the nonperiodic nature of the chaotic
signal itself produces an effect that is indistinguishable at the receiver from the effect of additive channel noise.
By increasing the bit duration T, the variance of estimation can be reduced, but it also imposes a constraint on
the maximum symbol rate. The estimation problem can be solved completely by keeping the energy per symbol
constant. In this case, the variance of the samples of the observation signal is zero, as shown in Fig. 5.25(b).
