1964 with proposed use of selective emitters, development of rare-earth oxide systems for selective emission,
and with use of germanium photocells [2–4]. By the mid-1970s, system designs of up to 1 kW with projected
efﬁciencies of 6 to 7% were brought to the stage of working prototypes [5]. Interest waned as the beneﬁts did
not appear to outweigh the challenges in thermal management and structural stability through thermal cycling
to the required emitter temperatures.
