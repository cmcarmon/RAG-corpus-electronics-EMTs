Note that the source is zero for t â‰¤ 0, but nonzero for t > 0, so that it effectively
turns on at t = 0. A sketch of the current step input is shown in Figure 9.37a.
To complete the analysis of the circuit, we substitute the correspond-
ing source function from Equation 9.75 into Equation 9.63 and carry out the
indicated integration.3 The substitution of Equation 9.75 into Equation 9.63
yields
