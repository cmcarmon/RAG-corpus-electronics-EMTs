For the Ô¨Årst method, described fully in Li and Yurkovich
(2001), a continuous SMC design method was given for systems
with point delay in both states and control. A linear transfor-
mation was applied to convert the delay system to a delay-free
system whose spectra embed all the unstable poles of the
