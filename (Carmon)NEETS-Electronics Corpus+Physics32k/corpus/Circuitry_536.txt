preserved in the flag register so that, for example, 
an  overflow,  zero  or  negative  result  can  be 
detected. 
  The control unit is responsible for the movement 
of  data  within  the  CPU  and  the  management  of 
control  signals,  both  internal  and  external.  The 
control unit asserts the requisite signals to read or 
write data as appropriate to the current instruction. 
 
Input and output 
 
The transfer of data within a microprocessor system 
involves  moving  groups  of  8,  16  or  32-bits  using 
the bus architecture described earlier. Consequently 
it is a relatively simple matter to transfer data into 
and out of the system in parallel form. This process 
is  further  simplified  by  using  a  Programmable 
Parallel I/O device (a Z80PIO, 8255, or equivalent 
VLSI  chip).  This  device  provides  registers  for  the 
temporary  storage  of  data  that  not  only  buffer  the 
data but also provide a degree of electrical isolation 
from the system data bus. 
  Parallel data transfer is primarily suited to  high-
speed  operation  over  relatively  short  distances,  a 
typical 
a 
microcomputer  to  an  adjacent  dot  matrix  printer.
