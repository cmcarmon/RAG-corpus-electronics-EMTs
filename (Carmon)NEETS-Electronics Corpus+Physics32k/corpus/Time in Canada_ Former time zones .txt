The Yukon Time Zone (UTC−09:00) covered Yukon until 1975. In 1983, the zone (then covering only a small portion of Alaska) was restructured to cover most of Alaska and renamed the Alaska Time Zone.
In 1988, Newfoundland and Labrador used "double daylight saving time" from April 3 until October 30, meaning that the time was set ahead by 2 hours. Most of Labrador, which uses Atlantic Standard Time (UTC−4) used UTC−2 for this time period. All of Newfoundland and southern Labrador, which uses UTC−3:30 as its standard time zone, used UTC−1:30. This only happened in 1988 and the province now only adjusts its time by one hour for daylight saving time.
