Chapter 4 describes the theory of transmission lines. Trans-
mission equations for voltage and current are derived based on
lumped-element circuit models. The propagation characteris-
tics of both lossless and lossy lines are discussed with the latter
emphasized on low-loss cases and cases lacking distortion.
Useful parameters of a terminated transmission line, including
impedance, reﬂection coefﬁcient, voltage, and current, at vari-
ous locations on the line are discussed in detail. The basic
operation of the Smith chart to relate the reﬂection coefﬁcient
to the input impedance at the transmission line is explained
and examples are given.
