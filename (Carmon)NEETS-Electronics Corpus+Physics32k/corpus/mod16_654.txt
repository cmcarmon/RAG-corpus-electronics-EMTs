In figure 6-30, you can see the components used to calibrate the test probe on the scope. A 1-volt,
2-kilohertz square wave signal is provided for you to adjust the probe for an accurate square wave and to
check the vertical gain of the scope. You adjust the probe with a screwdriver, as shown in the figure.
