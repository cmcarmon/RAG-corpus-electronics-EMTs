THE POTENTIOMETER AND THE RHEOSTAT are variable resistors and can be adjusted to
any resistance value within their ohmic range. The rheostat is usually used for relatively high current
applications and has two connections; the potentiometer has 3 connections and is a relatively high-
resistance, low-current device.
