The input impedance to this ampliÔ¨Åer circuit is just the parallel combination of RB and
hie, and since hie is usually much smaller than RB, the input impedance generally reduces to
just the input impedance of the transistor itself, namely, hie. The circuit output impedance
is the collector resistance RC.
