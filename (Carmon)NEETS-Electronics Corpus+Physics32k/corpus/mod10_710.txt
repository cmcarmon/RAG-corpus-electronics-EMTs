Next consider a wavefront traveling toward point Q from antenna B. By the time it reaches antenna 
A, 1/2 wavelength away, 1/2 cycle has elapsed. Therefore energy from antenna B meets the energy from 
antenna A 180 degrees out of phase. As a result, the energy moving toward point Q from the two sources 
cancels. In a like manner, radiation from antenna A traveling toward point Q1 meets and cancels the 
radiation in the same direction from antenna B. As a result, little propagation takes place in either 
direction along the QQ1 axis. Most of the energy is concentrated in both directions along the PP1 axis. 
When both antenna elements are fed from the same source, the result is the basic broadside array.
