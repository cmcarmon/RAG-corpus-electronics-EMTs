As explained in item 2, Cs/Ct = 1 is chosen. Using the constraints (1) minimum kVA rating of tank circuit
per kW output power, (2) minimum inverter output peak current, and (3) enough turn-off time for the
switches,  it  can  be  shown  that  [Bhat,  1991]  Qs  =  4  and  ys  =  1.1  satisfy  the  design  constraints.  From
Fig. 30.36, M = 0.8 p.u.
