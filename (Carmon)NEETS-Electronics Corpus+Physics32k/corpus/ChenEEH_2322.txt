Figure 4.13 displays a typical commercially available Smith
chart. The basic operations of the chart can be understood by an
example to be discussed next. For better clarity and practice, it is
highly recommended to follow this example by repeating the
graphical solution taps on a new Smith chart. Suppose that a
(1=3)l-long, 50V line is connected to a load impedance of
(25 þ j25) V. The input impedance and reﬂection coefﬁcient
can be determined by using the Smith chart. The load imped-
ance is normalized, and the point (0:5 þ j0:5) is plotted and
shown as point A in Figure 4.13. This point can be translated to
the input by moving (1=3)l toward the generator. Two scales on
the Smith chart’s outer periphery indicate movement in wave-
lengths either toward the generator (clockwise) or toward the
load (counterclockwise). One complete rotation around the
