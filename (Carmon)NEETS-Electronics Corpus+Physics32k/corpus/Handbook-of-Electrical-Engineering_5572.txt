Therefore, it is unnecessary to store these values in separate arrays, simplifying the program and reducing the
computer storage requirements signiﬁcantly. The error introduced by this approximation is usually not impor-
tant. The methods previously discussed neglect the prefault, or load, component of current; that is, the usual
assumption  is  that  currents  throughout  the  system  were  zero  prior  to  the  fault.  This  is  almost  never  strictly
true;  however,  the  error  produced  is  small  since  the  fault  currents  are  generally  much  larger  than  the  load
currents. Also, the load currents and fault currents are out of phase with each other, making their sum more
nearly equal to the larger components than would have been the case if the currents were in phase. In addition,
selection  of  precise  values  for  prefault  currents  is  somewhat  speculative,  since  there  is  no  way  of  predicting
what the loaded state of the system is when a fault occurs. When it is important to consider load currents, a
power ﬂow study is made to calculate currents throughout the system, and these values are superimposed on
(added to) results from the fault study.
