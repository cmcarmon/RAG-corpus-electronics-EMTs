Galactocentric orbit: An orbit about the center of a galaxy. The Sun follows this type of orbit about the galactic center of the Milky Way.
Heliocentric orbit: An orbit around the Sun. In the Solar System, all planets, comets, and asteroids are in such orbits, as are many artificial satellites and pieces of space debris. Moons by contrast are not in a heliocentric orbit but rather orbit their parent object.
Geocentric orbit: An orbit around the planet Earth, such as that of the Moon or of artificial satellites.
Areocentric orbit: An orbit around the planet Mars, such as that of its moons or artificial satellites.
Lunar orbit (also selenocentric orbit): An orbit around the Earth's moon.
Hermocentric orbit (also hermiocentric orbit): An orbit around the planet Mercury.
Aphrodiocentric orbit (also cytheriocentric orbit): An orbit around the planet Venus.
Jovicentric orbit (also zenocentric orbit): An orbit around the planet Jupiter.
Kronocentric orbit (also saturnocentric orbit): An orbit around the planet Saturn.
Oranocentric orbit: An orbit around the planet Uranus.
Poseidocentric orbit: An orbit around the planet Neptune.
