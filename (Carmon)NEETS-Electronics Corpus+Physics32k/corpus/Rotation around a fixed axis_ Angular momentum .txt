The angular momentum L is a measure of the difficulty of bringing a rotating object to rest. It is given by





L

r

×

p

.


{\displaystyle \mathbf {L} =\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {p} .}

Angular momentum is related to angular velocity by





L

I

ω

,


{\displaystyle \mathbf {L} =I{\boldsymbol {\omega }},}

just as p = mv in linear dynamics.
The equivalent of linear momentum in rotational motion is angular momentum. The greater the angular momentum of the spinning object such as a top, the greater its tendency to continue to spin.
The Angular Momentum of a rotating body is proportional to its mass and to how rapidly it is turning. In addition the angular momentum depends on how the mass is distributed relative to the axis of rotation: the further away the mass is located from the axis of rotation, the greater the angular momentum . A flat disk such as a record turntable has less angular momentum than a hollow cylinder of the same mass and velocity of rotation.
Like linear momentum, angular momentum is vector quantity, and its conservation implies that the direction of the spin axis tends to remain unchanged. For this reason the spinning top remains upright whereas a stationary one falls over immediately.
The angular momentum equation can be used to relate the moment of the resultant force on a body about an axis (sometimes called torque), and the rate of rotation about that axis.
Torque and angular momentum are related according to

,


{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\tau }}={\frac {d\mathbf {L} }{dt}},}

just as F = dp/dt in linear dynamics. In the absence of an external torque, the angular momentum of a body remains constant. The conservation of angular momentum is notably demonstrated in figure skating: when pulling the arms closer to the body during a spin, the moment of inertia is decreased, and so the angular velocity is increased.
