In general, fusion splicing takes a longer time to complete than mechanical splicing. Also, yields are
typically lower making the total time per successful splice much longer for fusion splicing. Both the yield
and splice time are determined to a large degree by the expertise of the fusion splice operator. Fusion
splice operators must be highly trained to consistently make low-loss reliable fusion splices. For these
reasons the fusion splice is not recommended for use in Navy shipboard applications.
