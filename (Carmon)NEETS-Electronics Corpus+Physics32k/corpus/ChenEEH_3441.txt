As explained earlier, the distance protection principle is based
on calculation of the impedance ‘‘seen’’ by the relay. This
impedance is deﬁned as the apparent impedance of the pro-
tected line calculated using the voltages and currents measured
at the relaying point. Once the impedance is calculated, it is
compared to the relay operating characteristic. If identiﬁed as
falling into one of the zones, the impedance is considered as
corresponding to a fault; as a result, the relay issues a trip. The
concept of the impedance being proportional to the length of
the transmission line and the idea of using the relay settings to
correspond to the line length lead to the reason for calling this
relaying principle distance relaying.
