The radiated energy consists of an infinite number of RADIAL SECTIONS (RAYS). Each of the 
radial sections contains mutually perpendicular E and H lines and both are perpendicular to the direction 
of travel. Because each of the radial sections travels in a different direction, the point source, in itself, has 
poor directivity. The purpose of the lens is to convert the input spherical microwave segment (which 
consists of all of the radial sections) into parallel (collimated) lines in a given direction at the exit side of 
the lens. The focusing action of the lens is accomplished by the refracting qualities of the metallic strips. 
The collimating effect of the lens is possible because the velocity of electromagnetic energy propagation 
through metals is greater than its velocity through air. Because of the concave construction of the lens, 
wavefronts arriving near the ends of the lens travel farther in the same amount of time than do those at the 
center. Thus, the wavefront emerging from the exit side of the lens appears as a plane wave. It consists of 
an infinite number of parallel sections (with both the E field and H field components) mutually 
perpendicular to the direction of travel.
