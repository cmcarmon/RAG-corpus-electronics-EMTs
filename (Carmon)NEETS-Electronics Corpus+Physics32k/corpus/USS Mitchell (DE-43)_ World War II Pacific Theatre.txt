After shakedown and training off San Diego, California, Mitchell sailed on 2 February 1944 as part of the escort of a convoy of eight liberty ships sailing to Hawaii. Arriving Pearl Harbor on 10 February, Mitchell spent the next four months operating with American submarines in Task Force 16, Service Force Pacific Fleet. These maneuvers were a valuable training aid to both Mitchell and the submarines.
