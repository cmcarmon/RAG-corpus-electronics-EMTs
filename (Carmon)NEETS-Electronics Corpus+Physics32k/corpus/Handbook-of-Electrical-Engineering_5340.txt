Efﬁciency is deﬁned as the maximum power divided by the power in the solar spectrum (for the solar cell
area). The theoretical maximum efﬁciency as a function of photon energy and solar spectrum can be calculated
and is shown in Fig. 60.7. The effect of energy gap is embedded in term ni in the equation for J0.
