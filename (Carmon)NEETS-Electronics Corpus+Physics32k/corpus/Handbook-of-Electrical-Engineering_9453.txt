Reliability is perhaps one of the most important attributes of systems. The reliability of a system is generally
derived  in  terms  of  the  reliabilities  of  the  individual  components  of  the  system.  The  two  models  of  systems
that are most common in practice are the series and the parallel. In a series system, each element of the system
is required to operate correctly for the system to operate correctly. In a parallel system, on the other hand, only
one of several elements must be operational for the system to perform its functions correctly.
