uncertainty or ambiguity in the measurement of range, which may or may not be signiﬁcant, depending on
the parameters chosen and the application. For example, if the Doppler frequency is low (as in an altimeter)
and/or the difference frequency is high, the error in range measurement may be tolerable. For the symmetrical
triangular waveform, a Doppler less than Fb averages out, since it is higher on one-half of a cycle and lower on
the other half. With a sawtooth modulation, only a decrease or increase is noted, since the frequencies produced
in the transient during a rapid ﬂyback are out of the receiver passband. Exact analyses of triangular, sawtooth,
dual triangular, dual sawtooth, and combinations of these with noise have been carried out by Tozzi [1972].
Speciﬁc design parameters are given later in this chapter for an application utilizing sawtooth modulation in
a missile terminal guidance seeker.
