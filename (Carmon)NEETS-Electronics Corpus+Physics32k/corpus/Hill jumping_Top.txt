Hill jumping is the act of accelerating a rally vehicle as it approaches the top of a hill, causing the vehicle to go airborne. The activity is also called "hill topping" and "yumping".
Hill jumping may take place at formal rally racing events or, at substantial risk to the health and safety of participants and third parties, on public roads at informal gatherings or by thrill seeking individuals.
