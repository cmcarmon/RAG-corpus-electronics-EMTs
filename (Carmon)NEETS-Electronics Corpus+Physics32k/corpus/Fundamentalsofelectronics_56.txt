Example 2.1
When we solve circuit problems, the crucial quantity, known as a transfer function, will always be
expressed as the ratio of polynomials in the variable s = j2πf. What we’ll need to understand the
circuit’s eﬀect is the transfer function in polar form. For instance, suppose the transfer function
equals
