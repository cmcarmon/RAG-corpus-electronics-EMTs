The design of the antenna system is very important in a transmitting station. The antenna must be 
able to radiate efficiently so the power supplied by the transmitter is not wasted. An efficient transmitting 
antenna must have exact dimensions. The dimensions are determined by the transmitting frequencies. The 
dimensions of the receiving antenna are not critical for relatively low radio frequencies. However, as the 
frequency of the signal being received increases, the design and installation of the receiving antenna 
become more critical. An example of this is a television receiving antenna. If you raise it a few more 
inches from the ground or give a slight turn in direction, you can change a snowy blur into a clear picture.
