Dielectric leakage occurs in a capacitor as the result of LEAKAGE CURRENT through the dielectric.
Normally it is assumed that the dielectric will effectively prevent the flow of current through the capacitor.
Although the resistance of the dielectric is extremely high, a minute amount of current does flow. Ordinarily
this current is so small that for all practical purposes it is ignored. However, if the leakage through the
dielectric is abnormally high, there will be a rapid loss of charge and an overheating of the capacitor.
