Receiver and Exciter
This  subsystem  contains  the  precision  timing  and  frequency  reference  source  or  sources  used  to  derive  the
master oscillator and local oscillator reference frequencies. These reference frequencies are used to downconvert
received  signals  in  a  multiple-stage  superheterodyne  architecture  to  accommodate  signal  ampliÔ¨Åcation  and
interference rejection. The receiver front end is typically protected from overload during transmission through
the combination of a circulator and a transmit/receive switch.
