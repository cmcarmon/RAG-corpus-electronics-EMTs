Comparisons and Further Notes
When approached as ‘‘batch’’ (i.e., nonlattice) solutions to the
Ax ¼ b problem according to the methods described above,
the solution methods are of O(M) complexity, with the auto-
correlation method being slightly, but insigniﬁcantly, more
efﬁcient. Variations exist on the general algorithms discussed
above, some being more efﬁcient than others (Markel and
Gray, 1976), but all commonly used methods are of O(M)
complexity.
