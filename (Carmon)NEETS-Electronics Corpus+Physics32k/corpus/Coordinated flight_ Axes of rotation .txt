An airplane has three axes of rotation:
Pitch – in which the nose of the airplane moves up or down. This is typically controlled by the elevator at the rear of the airplane.
Yaw – in which the nose of the airplane moves left or right. This is typically controlled by the rudder at the rear of the airplane.
Roll (bank) – in which one wing of the airplane moves up and the other moves down. This is typically controlled by ailerons on the wings of the airplane.
Coordinated flight requires the pilot to use pitch, roll and yaw control simultaneously. See also flight dynamics.
