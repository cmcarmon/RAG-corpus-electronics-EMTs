According to the deformation potential theory, the strain will shift the energy of all the states in a given band
extremum  by  the  same  amount,  i.e.,  the  valley  moves  along  the  energy  scale  as  a  whole  by  an  amount  (the
deformation  potential  constant)  which  is  linearly  proportional  to  the  strain.  Let’s  assume  that  the  energy  of
those on the y- and z-axes are lowered with respect to those on the x-axis. This effect is represented by dashed
lines in Fig. 51.1. As a result, there will be electron transfer from the high to low energy valleys. The components
of  the  mobility  tensor mxy  (=  e t/mxy,  where  e  is  the  electron  charge, t  is  the  relaxation  time,  and mxy  is  the
effective  mass)  are  illustrated  by  arrows  in  Fig. 51.1.  The  mobility  anisotropy  is  due  to  the  curvature  of  the
conduction band near the bottom. The effective mass is inversely proportional to this curvature (1/mxy = (h/2p)–2
(¶2E/¶k x¶ky), which is larger for a direction perpendicular to the valley. For an applied E ﬁeld parallel to the
stress,  the  conductivity  will  increase  (i.e.,  the  resistivity  decreases)  relative  to  the  unstressed  state  because  of
the increase in the number of electrons in the four valleys (yz-plane) for which the mobility is large in the ﬁeld
direction. If the ﬁeld is perpendicular to the stress, the conductivity will decrease (i.e., the resistivity increases)
with stress. Therefore, the piezoresistivity components P11 and P12 have opposite signs.
