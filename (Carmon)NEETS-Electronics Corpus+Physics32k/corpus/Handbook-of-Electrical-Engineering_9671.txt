Cryptographic Protocols
A general framework for casting n-party cryptographic problems consists of specifying a random process that
maps n inputs to n outputs. The inputs to the process are to be thought of as local inputs of n parties, and the
n outputs are their corresponding local outputs. The random process describes the desired functionality. That
is, if the n parties were to trust each other (or trust some outside party), then they could each send their local
input  to  the  trusted  party,  who  would  compute  the  outcome  of  the  process  and  send  each  party  the  corre-
sponding output. The question addressed in this section is: to what extent can such a trusted party be “emulated”
by the mutually distrustful parties themselves? We consider two general settings: two-party protocols and multi-
party protocols in which the majority of the players are honest. We start with the latter case.
