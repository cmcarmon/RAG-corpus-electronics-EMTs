that zone. Because all small offsets should be encoded
in a one-hot code, the latter approach is the most
convenient. As a simple example, consider an applica-
tion that works with three vectors (A, B, and C) as
shown in Figure 7.8. Memory references are often
interleaved among the three vectors and frequently
close to the previous reference to the vector. Thus, if
both the sender and the receiver had three registers
(henceforth named p) holding a pointer to each active
working zone, the sender would only need to send:
a. The offset of the current memory reference with
to the one associated with the current
