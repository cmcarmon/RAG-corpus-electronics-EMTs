Only local optimizations are possible at this level; more specif-
ically, the low-power techniques are applied for simple primi-
tive components that assume some speciÔ¨Åc input and output
characteristics, such as input rise and fall times and output
load capacitance. The techniques at this level are library cell
design, transistor sizing, and circuit design style.
