Electrostatic
Electrostatic sources utilize the force of attraction between charged capacitor plates. The force is independent
of the sign of the voltage, so a bias voltage is necessary for linear operation. Because the forces are relatively
weak, a large area is needed to obtain signiﬁcant acoustic output. The effect is reciprocal, with the change in
the separation of the plates (i.e., the capacitance) produced by an incident acoustic pressure generating a voltage.
The impedance of a condenser microphone, however, is high, so a preampliﬁer located close to the sensor is
required. Condenser microphones are very ﬂat and extremely sensitive. The change in capacitance induced by
an acoustic ﬁeld can also be detected by making the capacitor a part of a bridge circuit or, alternatively, a part
of an oscillator circuit. The acoustic signal will then appear as either an amplitude or frequency modulation
of  some  ac  carrier.  The  charge  storage  properties  of  electrets  have  been  exploited  to  produce  electrostatic
microphones which do not require a bias voltage.
