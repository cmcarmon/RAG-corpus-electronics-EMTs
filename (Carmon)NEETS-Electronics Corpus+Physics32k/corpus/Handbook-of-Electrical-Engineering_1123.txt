A  consequence  of  this  optimization  criterion  is  that  the  frequency  characteristics  of  optimal  ﬁlters  are
equiripple: although the maximum deviation from the desired characteristic is minimized, it is reached several
times in each band. Thus, the passband and stopband deviations oscillate about the desired values with equal
amplitude in each band. Such approximations are frequently referred to as minimax or Chebyshev approxima-
tions. In contrast, the maximum deviations occur near the band edges for ﬁlters designed by windowing.
