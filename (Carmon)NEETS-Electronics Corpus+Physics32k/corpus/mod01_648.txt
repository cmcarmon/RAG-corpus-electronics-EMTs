One circuit may require a 90-volt supply, another a 150-volt supply, and still another a 180-volt
supply. These voltage requirements could be supplied by three individual power sources. This method is
expensive and requires a considerable amount of room. The most common method of supplying these
voltages is to use a single voltage source and a VOLTAGE DIVIDER. Before voltage dividers are
explained, a review of what was discussed earlier concerning voltage references may be of help.
