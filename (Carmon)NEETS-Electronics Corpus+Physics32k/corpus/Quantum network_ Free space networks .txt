Free space quantum networks operate similar to fiber optic networks but rely on line of sight between the communicating parties instead of using a fiber optic connection. Free space networks can typically support higher transmission rates than fiber optic networks and do not have to account for polarization scrambling caused by optical fiber.
Importantly, free space communication is also possible from a satellite to the ground. A quantum satellite capable of distribution entanglement over a distance of 1203 km has been demonstrated. These satellites can play an important role in linking smaller ground based networks over larger distances.
