the supply rails: as far as possible these should 
be continuous from one end of the board to the 
other.  It  is  often  convenient  to  use  adjacent 
strips  for  supply  and  0  V  (or  ‘ground’)  since 
decoupling  
be 
distributed  at  strategic  points.  Ideally,  such 
capacitors  should  be  positioned 
in  close 
proximity to the positive supply input pin to all 
integrated  circuits  which  are  likely  to  demand 
sudden  transient  currents  (e.g.  555  timers, 
comparators, IC power amplifiers).
