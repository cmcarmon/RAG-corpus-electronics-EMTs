Similar to the Munsell Color System, Helmholtz designed a coordinate system. He used the principals of wavelength and purity (chroma) of the color for each hue to describe the location of when high saturation indicates a small amount of white.
The percentage of purity for each wavelength can be determined by the equation below:
%P = 100x(S-N)/(DW-N)
Where %P is the percent of purity, S is the point being assessed, N is the position of the white point, and DW the dominant wavelength.
