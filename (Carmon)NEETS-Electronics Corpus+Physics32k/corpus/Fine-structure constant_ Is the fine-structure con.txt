Physicists have pondered whether the fine-structure constant is in fact constant, or whether its value differs by location and over time. A varying α has been proposed as a way of solving problems in cosmology and astrophysics. String theory and other proposals for going beyond the Standard Model of particle physics have led to theoretical interest in whether the accepted physical constants (not just α) actually vary.
In the experiments below, Δα represents the change in α over time, which can be computed by αprev − αnow. If the fine-structure constant really is a constant, then any experiment should show that

or be as close to zero as that experiment can measure. Any value far away from zero would indicate that α does change over time. So far, most experimental data is consistent with α being constant.
