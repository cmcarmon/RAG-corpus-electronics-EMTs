Solution to Exercise 4.4 (p. 104)
The average of a set of numbers is the sum divided by the number of terms. Viewing signal integration as
the limit of a Riemann sum, the integral corresponds to the average.
Solution to Exercise 4.5 (p. 104)
We found that the Fourier series coeﬃcients are given by ck = 2
which means ak = 0. The coeﬃcients of the sine terms are given by bk = −2Im [ck] so that
