Interconnect lengths under scaling of feature size. (a) Initial VLSI ASIC function F with line A extending
across IC. (b) Interconnection cross section with resistance R* per unit length. (c) Interconnection cross section, in scaled
technology, with increased resistance per unit length. (d) VLSI ASIC function G in scaled technology containing function F
but reduced in size (including interconnection A) and containing a long line B extending across the IC.
