As you will learn in this chapter, there are many different types of oscilloscopesâ€”varying in
complexity from the simple to the complex. Before we get into our discussion of the dual-trace
oscilloscope, we will first present a general overview of basic single-trace oscilloscope operation. Shortly,
we will see how oscilloscopes use a CATHODE-RAY TUBE (CRT) in which controlled electron beams
are used to present a visible pattern of graphical data on a fluorescent screen.
