Hall coefﬁcient: The ratio between the Hall electric ﬁeld Ey (a ﬁeld that develops perpendicular to the plane
formed by the current and magnetic ﬁeld directions), and the current density jx multiplied by the magnetic
ﬁeld strength Bz; i.e., RH = Ey/jxBz. The Hall coefﬁcient is closely related to the carrier concentration.
