Power cable technology can be traced back to 1880, just shortly
after the introduction of incandescent lighting. Prior to World
War I, oil-impregnated paper cables were extensively used.
These had a three-conductor belted core made of copper and
were used up to 25 kV. Due to the nonuniform electric Ô¨Åeld
distribution inside the cable, this method of cable construction
was extremely prone to partial discharges. This problem was
solved by shielding the individual conductors with thin copper
tapes, and it was possible to raise the voltage to as high as
69 kV.
