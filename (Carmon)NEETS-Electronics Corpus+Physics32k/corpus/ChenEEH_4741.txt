ematical artifacts. As a result of the stability proof, the approx-
imator parameters are bounded using the adaptation laws in
theorem 1, so Vaj
does not need to be deﬁned explicitly, and
no parameter projection (or any other ‘‘artiﬁcial’’ means of
keeping the parameters bounded) is required. The representa-
tion error da1 arises because the sizes Naj
are ﬁnite, but it
may be made arbitrarily small within Sx1  Sv1 by increasing
Naj
(i.e., we assume the chosen approximator structures pos-
sess the universal approximation property). In this way, there
exists a constant bound da1 > 0 such that jda1j  da1 < 1. To
make the proof logically consistent, however, we need to
assume that some knowledge about this bound and a bound
on u
is available (since, in this case, it becomes possible to
guarantee a priori that Sx1  Sv1 is large enough). However, in
