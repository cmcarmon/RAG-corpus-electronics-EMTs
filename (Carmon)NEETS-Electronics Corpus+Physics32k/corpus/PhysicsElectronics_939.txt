Compared to dynamic memory, static memory has the following advantages. It is simpler
to use, about ten times faster and more reliable. On the other hand, it is more expensive,
consumes more power and requires more physical space. Because of power consumption in
an IC the largest static RAM is 16K bits. The largest dynamic RAM is 260K and hence is
used for normal applications while the static RAM is used for special fast applications within
the same computer. Both types of RAM are volatile, meaning that stored information is
lost when power is removed from the chip. Some computer designs provide a limited amount
of non-volatile read/write RAM storage by using special low-power (and slower) dynamic
memories powered by re-chargeable batteries.
