There have been many ideas proposed for launch-assist mechanisms that have the potential of drastically reducing the cost of getting into orbit. Proposed non-rocket spacelaunch launch-assist mechanisms include:
Skyhook (requires reusable suborbital launch vehicle, not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials)
Space elevator (tether from Earth's surface to geostationary orbit, cannot be built with existing materials)
Launch loop (a very fast enclosed rotating loop about 80 km tall)
Space fountain (a very tall building held up by a stream of masses fired from its base)
Orbital ring (a ring around Earth with spokes hanging down off bearings)
Electromagnetic catapult (railgun, coilgun) (an electric gun)
Rocket sled launch
Space gun (Project HARP, ram accelerator) (a chemically powered gun)
Beam-powered propulsion rockets and jets powered from the ground via a beam
High-altitude platforms to assist initial stage
