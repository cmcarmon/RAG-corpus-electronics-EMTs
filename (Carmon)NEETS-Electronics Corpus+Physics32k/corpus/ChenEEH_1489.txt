Table 4.1 shows an organization spanning 14 levels. It is not
a model of any particular operating system but rather exhibits
the relationships among the functions present in most operat-
ing systems. Each level encapsulates the system at lower levels
into an abstract machine and presents itself to the user, or a
program, by a set of objects and the associated operations. A
program written at a given level can invoke visible operations
at all lower levels, but not operations on higher levels.
