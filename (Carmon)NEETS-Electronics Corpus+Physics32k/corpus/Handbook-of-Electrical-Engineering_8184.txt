Introduction
The last few years have seen an explosive growth in manufacturing capacity and interest in full color plasma
displays. This is fueled by the realization that plasma displays can fulﬁll the long sought after goal of consumer-
affordable  hang-on-the-wall  ﬂat-panel  television  displays  with  diagonals  in  the  range  of  20  to  60  in.  Color
plasma displays operate on the same physical principle as ﬂuorescent lamps. A gas discharge generates ultraviolet
light which excites a phosphor layer that ﬂuoresces visible light. Differing phosphors are used for the red, green,
and blue primaries and a full color moving image is obtained by modulating each primary color sub-pixel to
one of typically 256 intensity levels at 60 times a second.
