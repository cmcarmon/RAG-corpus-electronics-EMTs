come  in  discrete  form  and  tend  to  be  more  bulky  and  expensive.  For
this  reason,  inductors  are  not  as  versatile  as  capacitors  and  resistors,
and  they  are  more  limited  in  applications.  However,  there  are  several
applications  in  which  inductors  have  no  practical  substitute. They  are
routinely  used  in  relays,  delays,  sensing  devices,  pick-up  heads,  tele-
phone circuits, radio and TV receivers, power supplies, electric motors,
microphones, and loudspeakers, to mention a few.
