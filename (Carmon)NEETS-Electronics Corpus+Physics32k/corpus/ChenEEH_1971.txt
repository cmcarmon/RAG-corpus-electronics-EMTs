the
nodes are executed in an allowed sequence (i.e., that the
main processor traverses the CFG correctly), which is not
necessarily the correct sequence of the program execution
since the selection itself is unchecked. To check the contents
of a node and the type and sequence of the instructions in it,
derived signature methods are required. One of the Ô¨Årst
methods developed to perform CFC using assigned signatures
is structural integrity checking (SIC) (Lu, 1982; Mahmood and
McCluskey, 1988), which makes use of the control structure
embedded in the syntax of the programming language.
