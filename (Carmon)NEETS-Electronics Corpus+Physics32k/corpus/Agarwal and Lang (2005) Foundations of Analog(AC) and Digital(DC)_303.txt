Once the branch variables of a circuit have been determined, it is possible to
examine the flow of energy through the circuit. This is often a very important
part of circuit analysis. Among other things, such an examination should show
that energy is conserved in the circuit. This is the case for the circuits in Fig-
ures 2.25 and 2.26. Using Equations 2.21 and 2.22 we see that the power into
the current source in Figure 2.25 is
