instead of the instruction sequence that actually searches the list for the record. If this operation is needed more
than  once,  then  the  obvious  advantage  is  saving  the  replication  of  instructions.  Much  more  important  is  a
second advantage: When we study the text of a program that uses Ô¨ÅndRecord, we most likely wish to understand
how this program processes and updates records or uses the information they contain. As this in itself may be
