No matter what value of a we choose, the above formulae clearly demonstrate the periodic nature
of the spectra of discrete-time signals. Figure 5.9 shows indeed that the spectrum is a periodic
function. We need only consider the spectrum between − 1
2 to unambiguously deﬁne it.
When a > 0, we have a lowpass spectrum—the spectrum diminishes as frequency increases from 0
to 1
2—with increasing a leading to a greater low frequency content; for a < 0, we have a highpass
spectrum (Figure 5.10).
