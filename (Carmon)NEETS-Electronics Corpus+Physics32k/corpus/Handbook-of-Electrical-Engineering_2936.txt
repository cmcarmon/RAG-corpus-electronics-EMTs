where k is Boltzmann’s constant and T is absolute temperature ((cid:176)Kelvin). To obtain the total output noise, one
must multiply the E 2
out  expression of Eq. (27.10) by the noise bandwidth of the circuit, which typically is equal
to p/2 times the –3 dB signal bandwidth, for a single-pole response system [Kennedy, 1988].
