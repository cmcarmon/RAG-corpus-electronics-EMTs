The most accurate method of zeroing a synchro is the ac voltmeter method. The procedure and the 
test circuit configuration for this method vary somewhat, depending upon which type of synchro is to be 
zeroed. Transmitters and receivers, differentials, and control transformers each require different test 
circuit configurations.
