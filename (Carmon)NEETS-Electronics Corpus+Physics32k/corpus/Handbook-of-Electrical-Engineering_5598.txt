Step-Distance Protection
The principle of distance measurement for faults is explained above. A relaying system utilizing that principle
must take into account several features of the measurement principle and develop a complete protection scheme.
Consider the system shown in Fig. 61.44. The distance relay Rab must protect line AB, with its zone of protection
as indicated by the dashed line. However, the distance calculation made by the relay is not precise enough for
