. Medium access control (MAC) access delay: If the trans-
mission link is shared, a suitable MAC protocol must be
used for accessing the link (Yu and Khanvilkar, 2002).
The choice of MAC protocol largely inﬂuences this delay.
For example, if the transmission capacity is C bps, and the
packet length is L bits, time taken to transmit is L/C,
assuming a dedicated link. However, if the MAC protocol
uses time division multiple access (TDMA) with m slots,
this delay becomes mL/C, which is m times larger than the
earlier case. The widespread ethernet networks cannot
provide any ﬁrm guarantees on this access delay (and
hence the overall QoS) due to the indeterminism of the
carrier sense multiple access/collision detection (CSMA/
CD) approach toward sharing of network capacity (Wolf
et al., 1997). The reason for this is that the collisions,
which occur in the bus-based ethernet when two stations
start transmitting at the same time, lead to delayed service
time. Fast ethernet exploits the same conﬁguration as
10 Mbps ethernet and increases the bandwidth with the
use of new hardware in hubs and end stations to
100 Mbps but provides no QoS guarantees. Isochronous
ethernet (integrated voice data LAN, IEEE 802.9) and
demand priority ethernet (100Base-VG, AnyLAN, IEEE
802.12) can provide QoS, yet their market potential
remains questionable.
