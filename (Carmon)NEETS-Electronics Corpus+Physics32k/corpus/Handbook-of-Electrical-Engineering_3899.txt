Figure 38.13 shows a slice through the normalized far-ﬁeld intensity of both a rectangular aperture and a
circular aperture. The linearity of the Fourier transform allows apertures to be represented as the superposition
of subapertures. The primary reﬂector, the obscurations from the support structures, and the secondary reﬂector
