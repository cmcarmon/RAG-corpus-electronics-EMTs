ﬁcation is to capture accurately the ﬁrst ﬁve pairs of the
complex poles of the structure. For this purpose, a DSPT
Siglab spectrum analyzer is used to measure the FRF data.
The sampling rate is set at 256 Hz, and the frequency reso-
lution is set at 0.125 Hz. The experimental FRF is precondi-
tioned to eliminate the second order direct current (dc) zeros
from acceleration measurement. The MF parameterization
is chosen for the curve-ﬁtting, which is complemented by
the ERA method for state-space realization. The key identiﬁ-
cation parameters are given in Table 6.1. The ﬁnal discrete-
time state-space realization has 10 states. The magnitude
and phase plots of its transfer functions are compared to
the experimental FRF data in Figures 6.3 and 6.4. Excellent
agreements are found in all but the very high frequency
range. The mismatch there is primarily due to the unmodeled
high-frequency dynamics.
