Under standard assumptions, specific orbital energy (



ϵ



{\displaystyle \epsilon \,}
) of elliptic orbit is negative and the orbital energy conservation equation (the Vis-viva equation) for this orbit can take the form:

{\displaystyle {v^{2} \over {2}}-{\mu  \over {r}}=-{\mu  \over {2a}}=\epsilon <0}

where:




v



{\displaystyle v\,}
is the speed of the orbiting body,




r



{\displaystyle r\,}
is the distance of the orbiting body from the center of mass of the central body,




a



{\displaystyle a\,}
is the semi-major axis,




μ



{\displaystyle \mu \,}
is the standard gravitational parameter.
Conclusions:
For a given semi-major axis the specific orbital energy is independent of the eccentricity.
Using the virial theorem we find:
the time-average of the specific potential energy is equal to 2ε
the time-average of r−1 is a−1

the time-average of the specific kinetic energy is equal to -ε
