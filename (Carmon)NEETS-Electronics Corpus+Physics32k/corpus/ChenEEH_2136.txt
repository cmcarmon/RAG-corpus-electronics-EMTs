Current is the ﬂow of charge. By convention, the direction of
this ﬂow is with the movement of positive charge. The amount
of charge dQ ﬂowing through (i.e., perpendicular) to a surface
in time dt is deﬁned as dQ ¼ Idt, where I is the current. In the
limit of inﬁnitesimally small time increments, the current
I through the surface can be deﬁned as:
