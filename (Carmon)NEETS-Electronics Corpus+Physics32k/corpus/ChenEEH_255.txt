There are two disadvantages to this fast VRM topology.
The ﬁrst one is the large current ripple. A huge VRM
output ﬁlter capacitance is needed to suppress the steady-
state ripple. The smaller inductance results in a faster transient
response but requires a larger bulk capacitance. The second
disadvantage is its low efﬁciency. In Figure 1.15, due to
the large ripple current, the QSW switch has a larger conduc-
tion loss. Its efﬁciency is lower than that of a conventional
VRM.
