As  with  stripboard  layouts,  it  is  well  worth 
devoting some time to checking the final draft PCB 
layout  before  starting  on  the  master  artwork.  This 
can  be  instrumental  in  saving  much  agony  and 
heartache  at  a  later  stage.  The  same  procedure 
should  be  adopted  as  described  on  page  330  (i.e. 
simultaneously tracing the circuit diagram and PCB 
layout).  
  The  next  stage  depends  upon  the  actual  PCB 
production.  Four  methods  are  commonly  used  for 
prototype  and  small-scale  production.  These  may 
be summarized as follows: 
 
(a)  Drawing the track layout directly on the copper 
 
surface of the board using a  special pen  filled 
  with etch resist ink. The track layout should, of 
course, conform as closely as possible with the 
 
 
draft layout. 
(b)  Laying down etch resist transfers of tracks and 
pads  on  to  the  copper  surface  of  the  PCB 
 
 
following  the  same  layout  as  the  draft  but 
appropriately scaled.
