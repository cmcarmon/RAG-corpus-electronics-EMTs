The full-load rated current of the 240-V winding, based on the rating of 50 kVA as a two-
winding transformer, is 50,000/240 = 208.33 A. Since the 240-V winding is in series
with the high-voltage circuit, the full-load current of this winding is the rated current on
the high-voltage side of the autotransformer,
