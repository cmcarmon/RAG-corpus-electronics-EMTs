sell resistors in packs of 5 or 10 for $1 or less. Resistors rated at 1/4 watt 
with 10% or 20% tolerance are fine. You can order a multipack for each 
resistance value, or you can buy a variety pack, such as RadioShack 
#271‚Äê312 ($14.49), which contains 500 assorted 1/4 W resistors with 5% 
tolerance and includes all the values listed next. Here are the resistor 
values, the color codes used to identify them, and the minimum quanti-
ties you need:
