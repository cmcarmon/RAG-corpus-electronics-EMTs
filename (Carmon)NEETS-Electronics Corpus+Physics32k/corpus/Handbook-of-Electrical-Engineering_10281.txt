The CMU can receive information via RF transceivers operating in conjunction with terrestrial, airborne,
or space-based transceivers. The capability also exists for transceiver pairs employing direct wire connections
or  very  short-range  optical  links  to  the  aircraft.  The  CMU  also  provides  the  routing  function  between  the
avionics, when applicable. Large on-board databases, such as an electronic library, may be accessed and provide
information to other avionics via the CMU.
