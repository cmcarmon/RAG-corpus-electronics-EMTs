During the transient, there are three spikes in the voltage
drop (Wong, 1997). The Ô¨Årst high-frequency spike is domin-
ated by loop 1, shown in Figure 1.8, which combines the
parasitic of the packaging capacitors and decoupling capacitors
and the interconnection between them. The second spike is
controlled by loop 2, which combines the parasitic of the
