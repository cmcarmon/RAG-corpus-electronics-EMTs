The Laplace plane or Laplacian plane of a planetary satellite, named after its discoverer Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749â€“1827), is a mean or reference plane about whose axis the instantaneous orbital plane of a satellite precesses.
Laplace's name is sometimes applied to the invariable plane, which is the plane perpendicular to a system's mean angular momentum vector, but the two should not be confused. They are equivalent only in the case where all perturbers and resonances are far from the precessing body.
