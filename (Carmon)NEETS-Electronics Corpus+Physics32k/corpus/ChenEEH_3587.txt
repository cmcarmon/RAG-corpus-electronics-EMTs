of the sampling frequency), the sampled signal spectrum will
be distorted in the frequencies around vs=2. In the case of
Figure 2.4(B), no distortion occurred only because the signal
had no power at vs=2. This distortion is known as aliasing and
is undesirable in most cases. As a consequence, only case
2.4(D)1 can be used to recover the spectrum of the original
continuous signal shown in Figure 2.4(A).
