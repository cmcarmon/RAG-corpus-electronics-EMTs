measure the dynamic pressure of the air stream from which they derive airspeed in an 
 computer. The
velocity of the wind or sea current must be vectorially added to that of the vehicle, as measured by a dynamic-
pressure sensor (Fig. 109.3). Hence, unpredicted wind or current will introduce an error into the dead-reckoning
computation.  Most  sensors  are  insensitive  to  the  component  of  airspeed  or  waterspeed  normal  to  their  axis
leeway
 in an aircraft). A Doppler radar measures the frequency shift in radar returns from the
(
ground  or  water  below  the  aircraft,  from  which  speed  is  inferred. A  Doppler  sonar  measures  a  ship’s  speed
relative to the water layer or ocean ﬂoor from which the beam reﬂects. Multibeam Doppler radars or sonars
can measure all the components of the vehicle’s velocity. Doppler radars are widely used on military helicopters.
  in  which  accelerometers  measure  the
vehicle’s acceleration while gyroscopes measure the orientation of the accelerometers. An on-board computer
resolves the accelerations into navigation coordinates and integrates them to obtain velocity and position. The
gyroscopes and accelerometers are mounted in either of two ways:
