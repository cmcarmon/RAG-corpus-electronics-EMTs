This discussion applies the following simplifications: the spring itself is taken as being weightless, and the spring is taken as being a perfect spring; the restoring force increases in a linear way as the spring is stretched out. That is, the restoring force is exactly proportional to the distance to the center of rotation. A restoring force with this characteristic is called a harmonic force.
The following parametric equation of the position as a function of time describes the motion of the circling masses:




x
=
a
cos
⁡
(
ω
t
)


{\displaystyle x=a\cos(\omega t)}
(1)




y
=
b
sin
⁡
(
ω
t
)


{\displaystyle y=b\sin(\omega t)}
(2)
Notation:




a


{\displaystyle a}
is half the length of the major axis




b


{\displaystyle b}
is half the length of the minor axis




ω


{\displaystyle \omega }
is 360 ° divided by the duration of one revolution
The motion as a function of time can be also be seen as a vector combination of two uniform circular motions. The parametric equations (1) and (2) can be rewritten as:

{\displaystyle x=\left({\begin{matrix}{\frac {a+b}{2}}\end{matrix}}\right)\cos(\omega t)+\left({\begin{matrix}{\frac {a-b}{2}}\end{matrix}}\right)\cos(\omega t)}

A transformation to a coordinate system that subtracts the overall circular motion leaves the eccentricity of the ellipse-shaped trajectory. the center of the eccentricity is located at a distance of

That is in fact what is seen in the second animation, in which the motion is mapped to a coordinate system that is rotating at a constant angular velocity. The angular velocity of the motion with respect to the rotating coordinate system is 2ω, twice the angular velocity of the overall motion. The spring is continuously doing work. More precisely, the spring is oscillating between doing positive work (increasing the weight's kinetic energy) and doing negative work (decreasing the weight's kinetic energy)
