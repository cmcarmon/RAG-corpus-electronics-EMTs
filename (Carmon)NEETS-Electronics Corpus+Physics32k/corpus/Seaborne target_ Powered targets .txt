In the U.S. Navy, a Seaborne Powered Target (SEPTAR) is an unmanned surface vehicle used as the naval counterpart of a target drone. They are remote-controlled, and all but the smallest can be equipped with electromagnetic emitters to appear as a larger ship on sensors.
As of 2013, U.S. Navy SEPTARs include:
Hammerhead usv-t: A high-speed drone capable of multiple vessel attacks.
Mobile Ship Target (MST): A ship-sized target some 260 feet (79 m) long, with a top speed of 15 knots (28 km/h).
QST-35: A fiberglass boat with a top speed of 30 knots (56 km/h), usable manned or unmanned, or as a mine countermeasure.
Fast-Attack Craft Target (FACT): A smaller, more agile fiberglass boat with a top speed of 50 knots (93 km/h), intended to challenge gunners.
High-Speed Maneuvering Surface Target (HSMST): A boat similar to a harbor patrol boat, designed for operations in shallow waters, with a top speed of 46 knots (85 km/h).
Ship-Deployable Surface Target (SDST): A small craft similar to a water scooter, which can also be used as one, with a top speed of 49 knots (91 km/h).
