Another potential hazard of using a multimeter in its current-measuring (”ammeter”) mode
is failure to properly put it back into a voltage-measuring conﬁguration before measuring volt-
age with it. The reasons for this are speciﬁc to ammeter design and operation. When mea-
suring circuit current by placing the meter directly in the path of current, it is best to have
the meter offer little or no resistance against the ﬂow of electrons. Otherwise, any additional
