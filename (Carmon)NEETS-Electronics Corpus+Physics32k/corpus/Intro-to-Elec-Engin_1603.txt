Subject to the constraint in Equation (16.1.31), the steady-state expression of current can be
obtained. Flux being a constant, recall that the average motor torque depends only on the average
value or the dc component of the armature current, whereas the ac components produce only
pulsating torques with zero-average value. Thus, the motor torque is given by
