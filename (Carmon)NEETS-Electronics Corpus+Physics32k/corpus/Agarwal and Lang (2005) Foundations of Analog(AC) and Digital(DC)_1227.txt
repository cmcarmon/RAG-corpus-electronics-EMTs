shows two inverters communicating over a long interconnect. As we discussed
in Chapter 1, within our lumped-circuit abstraction, the interconnect is perfect.
Specifically, by the definition of the lumped circuit abstraction (see Section 1.2),
the wires interconnecting the elements have no resistance. Furthermore, by the
lumped matter discipline which underlies the lumped circuit abstraction, the
wires and other circuit elements store no electric charge and link no magnetic
flux outside the elements. Reality, however, is different, and in some cases this
difference is important. As Figure 9.4 shows, any interconnect having a potential
difference with its surroundings actually stores an electric charge q that sources
an electric field E between that charge and its image. Furthermore, in order to
supply the charge, a current i must flow around the interconnect loop. This
current in turn generates a magnetic flux density B that is linked by the loop.
So, real interconnects do store electric charge and do link external magnetic
flux, thereby appearing to violate the lumped matter discipline. They will also
exhibit a nonzero resistance. These factors can all contribute to a reduction in
the speed of the circuit as a whole, and at times it is important to study these
effects.
