below the resonant frequency point. The two points are designated upper frequency cutoff (fco) and lower 
frequency cutoff (fco) or simply f1 and f2. The range of frequencies between these two points comprises 
the bandwidth. Views (A) and (B) of figure 1-12 illustrate the bandwidths for low- and high-Q resonant 
circuits. The bandwidth may be determined by use of the following formulas:
