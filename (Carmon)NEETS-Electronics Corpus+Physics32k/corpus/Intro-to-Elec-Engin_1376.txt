The growth in communications over the past 60 years has been phenomenal. The invention of
the transistor in 1947 and the integrated circuit and laser in 1958 have paved the way to satellite
communication systems. Most of the wire-line communication systems are being replaced by
Ô¨Åber-optic cables (providing extremely high bandwidth), which makes the transmission of a wide
variety of information sources (voice, data, and video) possible. High-speed communication
networks linking computers and the greater need for personal communication services are just
the beginning of the modern telecommunications era.
