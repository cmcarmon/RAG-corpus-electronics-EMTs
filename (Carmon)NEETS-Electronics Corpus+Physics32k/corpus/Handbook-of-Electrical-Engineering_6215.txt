unit to “match” the complex impedance of the antenna system to the characteristic impedance of the transmitter
and transmission line so that maximum transfer of power may occur. Typical heights for AM broadcast towers
range from 150 to 500 ft. When the radiated signal must be modiﬁed to prevent interference to other stations
or to provide better service in a particular direction, additional towers may be combined in a phased array to
produce the desired ﬁeld intensity contours. For example, if a station power increase would cause interference
with existing stations, a directional array could be designed that would tailor the coverage to protect the existing
stations while allowing increases in other directions. The protection requirements can generally be met with
arrays consisting of 4 towers or less, but complex arrays have been constructed consisting of 12 or more towers
to meet stringent requirements at a particular location. An example of a directional antenna pattern is shown
in Fig. 69.12. This pattern provides major coverage to the southwest and restricts radiation (and thus interfer-
ence) towards the northeast.
