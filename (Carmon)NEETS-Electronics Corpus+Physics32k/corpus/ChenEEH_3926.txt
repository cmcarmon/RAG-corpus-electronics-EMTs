likely that a particular realization (observation) of the random
variable would have been produced from a particular distribu-
tion. The higher the value the likelihood function, the more
likely the particular value of the parameter will have produced
that realization of x. Hence, the cost function in the Fisherian
estimation paradigm is the likelihood function, and the objec-
tive is to Ô¨Ånd a value of the parameter that maximizes the
likelihood function, resulting in the maximum likelihood
estimate (MLE).
