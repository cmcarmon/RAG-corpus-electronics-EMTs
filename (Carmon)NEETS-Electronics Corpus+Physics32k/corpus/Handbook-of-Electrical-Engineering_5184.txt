In  all  the  preceding  applications,  the  basic  consideration  is  that  the  relevant  structure  can  smartly  and
adaptively change its electromagnetic properties (normally speciÔ¨Åed via dielectric permittivity, magnetic per-
meability, and electrical conductivity parameters) so that the desired electromagnetic performance is acheived.
Two typical systems are detailed next.
Electromagnetic Active Surface Embedded with Ferroelectric Inclusions
Figure 58.5 illustrates the concept of a smart electromagnetic active surface. The surface is made of a mixture
of polyacrylamide, ferrite, and barium titanate on a ceramic substrate. This skin material, which represents a
lossy,  nonlinear  electromagnetic  medium  with  anisotropic  ferroelectric  and  ferromagnetic  properties,  offers
different extents of surface impedence, in the presence and absence of an electric voltage stimulus applied to
