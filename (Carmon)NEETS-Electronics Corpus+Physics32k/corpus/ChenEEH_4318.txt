Control theory and the tools used in control theory are
particularly useful in the study of biomedical engineering and
medicine, and the applications extend from the ‘‘head to the
toes.’’ Implantable organs, such as the heart, ear, kidney, and
retina, all require exacting control systems that are designed
with a signiﬁcant number of parameters and need to work
reliably 100% of the time. Other capabilities under develop-
ment, such as remote surgery, also require extensive control
systems because a minor slip could be life-threatening. The
controller needs to be able to differentiate between intentional
hand movement and a tremor on the part of the surgeon.
