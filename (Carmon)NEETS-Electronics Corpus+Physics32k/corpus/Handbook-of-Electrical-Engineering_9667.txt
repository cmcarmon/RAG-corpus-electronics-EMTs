Note that in contrast to the speciﬁcation of signature schemes, we do not require universal veriﬁcation. That
is, only the receiver is required to be able to verify the authentication tags; and the fact that the receiver can
also produce such tags is of no concern. Thus, schemes for message authentication can be viewed as a private-
key version of signature schemes. The difference between the two is that, in the setting of message authentication,
the ability to verify tags can be linked to the ability to authenticate messages; whereas in the setting of signature
schemes, these abilities are separated (i.e., everybody can verify signatures but only the holder of the signing
key can produce valid signatures). Hence, digital signatures provide a solution to the message authentication
problem, but message authentication schemes do not necessarily constitute digital signature schemes.
