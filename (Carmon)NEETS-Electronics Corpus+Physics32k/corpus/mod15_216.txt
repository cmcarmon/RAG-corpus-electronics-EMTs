When trouble occurs in an electronic installation that contains a large number of synchro systems, it 
may be very difficult to isolate the trouble to one particular system. Since it is vital that maintenance 
personnel locate the point of trouble and fix it in as short a time as possible, indicators, which aid in 
locating the trouble quickly, are included in the equipment. These indicators are usually signal lights, 
mounted on a central control board and connected to the different synchro systems. When trouble occurs 
in a synchro system, the signal light connected to it may either light or flash. Maintenance personnel 
identify the defective system by reading the name or number adjacent to the light.
