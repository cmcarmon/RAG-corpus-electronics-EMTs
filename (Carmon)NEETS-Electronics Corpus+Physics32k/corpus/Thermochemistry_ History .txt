Thermochemistry rests on two generalizations. Stated in modern terms, they are as follows:
Lavoisier and Laplace’s law (1780): The energy change accompanying any transformation is equal and opposite to energy change accompanying the reverse process.
Hess' law (1840): The energy change accompanying any transformation is the same whether the process occurs in one step or many.
These statements preceded the first law of thermodynamics (1845) and helped in its formulation.
Lavoisier, Laplace and Hess also investigated specific heat and latent heat, although it was Joseph Black who made the most important contributions to the development of latent energy changes.
Gustav Kirchhoff showed in 1858 that the variation of the heat of reaction is given by the difference in heat capacity between products and reactants: dΔH / dT = ΔCp. Integration of this equation permits the evaluation of the heat of reaction at one temperature from measurements at another temperature.
