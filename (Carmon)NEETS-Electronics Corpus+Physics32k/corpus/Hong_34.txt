 
Impedance  is  one  of  the  most  important  concepts  in  electronic  circuits.  The 
purpose of impedance is to generalize the idea of resistance to create a component, shown 
in Figure 3.1, to capture the behavior of resistors, capacitors, and inductors, for steady-
state sinusoidal signals. This generalization is motivated by the fact that as long as the 
circuit is linear, its behavior can be analyzed using KVL and KCL.
