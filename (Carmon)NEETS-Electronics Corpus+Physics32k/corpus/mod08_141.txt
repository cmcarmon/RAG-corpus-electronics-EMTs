The third single-stage audio amplifier is shown in figure 1-25. This is a class A, common-emitter, 
transformer-coupled, transistor, audio amplifier. The output device (speaker) is shown connected to the 
secondary winding of the transformer. C1 is a coupling capacitor which couples the input signal to the 
base of Q1. R1 develops the input signal. R2 is used to bias the emitter of Q1 and provides temperature 
stability. C2 is a decoupling capacitor for R2. R3 is used to bias the base of Q1. The primary of T1 is the 
collector load for Q1 and develops the output signal. T1 couples the output signal to the speaker and 
provides impedance matching between the output impedance of the transistor (medium) and the 
impedance of the speaker (low).
