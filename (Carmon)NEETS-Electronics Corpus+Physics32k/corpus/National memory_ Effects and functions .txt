National memory can be a force of cohesion as well as division and conflict. It can foster constructive national reforms, international communities and agreements, dialogue as well as deepen problematic courses and rhetoric.
Identity crisis can occur due to bad memories (such as national crimes) or the absence of a belief in a shared past.
Often new developments, processes, problems and events are made sense of and contextualized by drawing from national memory.
