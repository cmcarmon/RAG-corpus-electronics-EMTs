Modern systems require lots of users` time in order to test for all the possible outputs of the systems and operators that trigger the activities of the specific system. However, in most of the cases new system doesn`t work as intended without identifying all the bugs in the code if related to software or testing all the system actions if talking about hardware systems. Modern projects that are producing different kinds of systems usually make their systems available to users with several bugs, as it is very difficult to test lots of different possibilities of actions of the system when the human force is only 10-20 people, so when the system goes live to thousands of people, users themselves test different outputs when working with the system.
