Good sensitivity is especially important in ammeters to be used in circuits in which small currents
flow. As the meter is connected in series with the load, the current flows through the meter. If the internal
resistance of the meter is a large portion of the load resistance, an effect known as METER-LOADING
will occur. Meter-loading is the condition that exists when the insertion of a meter into a circuit changes
the operation of that circuit. This condition is not desirable. The purpose of inserting a meter into a circuit
is to allow the measurement of circuit current in the normal operating condition. If the meter changes the
