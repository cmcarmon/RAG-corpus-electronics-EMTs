Thus far, Chapters 1 and 2 have shown that the operation of a lumped
system is described by two types of equations: equations that describe the
behavior of its individual elements, or element laws (Chapter 1), and equations
that describe how its elements interact when they are connected to form the
system, or KCL and KVL (Chapter 2). For an electronic circuit, the element
laws relate the branch currents to the branch voltages of the elements. The
interactions between its elements are described by KCL and KVL, which are
also expressed in terms of branch currents and voltages. Thus, branch currents
and voltages become the fundamental signals within a lumped electronic circuit.
