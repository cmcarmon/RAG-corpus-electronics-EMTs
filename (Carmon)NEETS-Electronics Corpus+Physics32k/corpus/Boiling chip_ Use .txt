Boiling chips should not be added to liquid that is already near its boiling point, as this could also induce flash boiling.
The structure of a boiling chip traps liquid while in use, meaning that they cannot be re-used in laboratory setups. They also don't work well under vacuum; if a solution is boiling under vacuum, it's best to constantly stir it instead.
