Some of the differences between voiced and unvoiced speech
segments are evident in the time waveform for the utterance of
the letter X in Figure 3.2. The leading voiced sound eh (written
=E= by phoneticians—see discussion concerning Table 3.1) is
higher in amplitude and contains strong periodic structure.
The ﬁnal unvoiced sound =s= is low in amplitude and noise-
like. Figure 3.3 shows corresponding magnitude spectra of the
steady-state portions of =E= and =s= in Figure 3.2. In Figure
3.3, we note that in each spectrum (and especially for the vowel
sound), there are well-deﬁned frequency ranges of emphasis
(resonances) and de-emphasis (antiresonances).
