When using Ohm’s Law, watch your units 
of measurement carefully. Make sure that 
you convert any kilos and millis before you 
get out your calculator. If you think of 
Ohm’s Law as volts amps ohms, you’ll be 
okay. And if you’re brave, you can also use 
volts milliamps kilohms, which works 
just as well (because the millis cancel out 
the kilos).
