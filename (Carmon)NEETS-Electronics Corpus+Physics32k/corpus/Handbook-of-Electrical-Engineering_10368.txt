This concept view is of the station from the opposite (aft port)
end. In the foreground (lower right) is the Russian service mod-
ule, with living and working room for three crew members. Next,
toward  the  center  of  the  photo,  is  the  FGB  energy  block,  then
(near  the  orbiter)  the  U.S.  laboratory  module.  The  vertically
mounted cylinder below it is the U.S. habitation module. (Photo
