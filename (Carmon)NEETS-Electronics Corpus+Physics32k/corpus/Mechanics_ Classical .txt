The following are described as forming classical mechanics:
Newtonian mechanics, the original theory of motion (kinematics) and forces (dynamics).
Analytical mechanics is a reformulation of Newtonian mechanics with an emphasis on system energy, rather than on forces. There are two main branches of analytical mechanics:
Hamiltonian mechanics, a theoretical formalism, based on the principle of conservation of energy.
Lagrangian mechanics, another theoretical formalism, based on the principle of the least action.

Classical statistical mechanics generalizes ordinary classical mechanics to consider systems in an unknown state; often used to derive thermodynamic properties.
Celestial mechanics, the motion of bodies in space: planets, comets, stars, galaxies, etc.
Astrodynamics, spacecraft navigation, etc.
Solid mechanics, elasticity, plasticity, viscoelasticity exhibited by deformable solids.
Fracture mechanics
Acoustics, sound ( = density variation propagation) in solids, fluids and gases.
Statics, semi-rigid bodies in mechanical equilibrium
Fluid mechanics, the motion of fluids
Soil mechanics, mechanical behavior of soils
Continuum mechanics, mechanics of continua (both solid and fluid)
Hydraulics, mechanical properties of liquids
Fluid statics, liquids in equilibrium
Applied mechanics, or Engineering mechanics
Biomechanics, solids, fluids, etc. in biology
Biophysics, physical processes in living organisms
Relativistic or Einsteinian mechanics, universal gravitation.
