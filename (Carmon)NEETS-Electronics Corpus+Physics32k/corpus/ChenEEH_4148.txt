We use our equalized signal r eq as the input to our detector to
determine the value of the kth transmitted bit. We must adjust
the values of ai to achieve some measure of performance of the
receiver. A typical measure is to minimize the mean square error
between the value of the detected bit at the output of the
summer and the output of the detector. Other measures for
the equalizer are possible. For more details, see Proakis (1989).
