EMYCIN (Buchanan and Shortliffe, 1984) is an example of
shells. The tools it provides include (a) an abbreviated rule
language that is easier to read than LISP and more concise than
the English subset used by MYCIN; (b) an indexing and
grouping scheme for rules; (c) a goal-driven inference engine;
(d) a communication interface between the program and the
end user; (e) an interface between the system designer and the
program, which supports displaying and editing rules, editing
knowledge in tables, and running selected rules sets on a
problem; and (f) facilities for monitoring the behavior of the
program, such as explaining how a conclusion is reached,
comparing the results of the current run with correct results
and exploring the discrepancies, and reviewing conclusions
about a stored library of cases.
