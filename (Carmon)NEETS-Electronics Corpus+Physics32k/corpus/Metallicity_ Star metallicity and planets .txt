A star's metallicity measurement is one parameter that helps determine if a star will have planets and the type of planets, as there is a direct correlation between metallicity and the type of planets a star may have. Measurements have demonstrated the connection between a star's metallicity and gas giant planets, like Jupiter and Saturn. The more metals in a star and thus its planetary system and proplyd, the more likely the system may have gas giant planets and rocky planets. Current models show that the metallicity along with the correct planetary system temperature and distance from the star are key to planet and planetesimal formation. Metallicity also affects a star's color temperature. Metal poor stars are bluer and metal rich stars are redder. The Sun, with 8 planets and 5 known dwarf planets, is used as the reference, with a [Fe/H] of 0.00. Other stars are noted with a positive or negative value. A star with a [Fe/H]=0.0 has the same iron abundance as the Sun. A star with [Fe/H]=âˆ’1.0 has one tenth heavy elements of that found in the Sun. At [Fe/H]=+1, the heavy element abundance is 10 times the Sun's value. The survey of stellar population of stars shows that older stars have less metallicity.
