“To find the motion of the apsides in orbits approaching circles.”
Proposition 44 was devised expressly to prove this Proposition. Newton wants to investigate the motion of a body in a nearly circular orbit attracted by a force of the form:



f
(
s
p
)
=
γ
.
s

p

{\displaystyle f(sp)=\gamma .sp^{n-3}}

He approximates the static curve by an ellipse with an inverse square force, F(SP) directed to one of the foci, made to revolve by the addition of an inverse cube force, according to Proposition 44.
For the static ellipse, with the force varying inversely as SP squared:



F
(
S
P
)
=



c

V

2




S

P

{\displaystyle F(SP)={\frac {cV^{2}}{SP^{2}}}}
, since c is defined above so that



F
(
S
A
)
=



c

V

S

A

{\displaystyle F(SA)={\frac {cV^{2}}{SA^{2}}}}

With the body in the static orbit starting from the upper apside at A, it will reach the lower apside, the point closest to S, after moving through an angle of 180degs. Newton wants a corresponding revolving orbit starting from apside, a, about a point s, with the lower apside shifted by an angle, α, where






(

+
α
)

180


=


v
V




{\displaystyle {\frac {(180+\alpha )}{180}}={\frac {v}{V}}}

The initial speed, V, at A must be just less than that required to make the body move in a circle. Then ρ can be taken as equal to SA or sa. The problem is to determine v from the value of n, so that α can be found, or given α, to find n.

{\displaystyle f(sp)=F(sp)+{\frac {c\rho (v^{2}-V^{2})}{sp^{3}}}={\frac {c(spV^{2}+sa(v^{2}-V^{2}))}{sp^{3}}}}

Then “by our method of converging series”:

plus terms in X2 and above which can be ignored because the orbit is almost circular, so X is small compared to sa.
Comparing the 2 expressions for f(sp):
