Procedure 
 
Connect the circuit shown in Fig. 8.22 with CIN = 
47 nF and CF = 2.2 nF, set the signal generator to 
produce  an  output  of  100  mV  at  1  kHz.  Measure 
and record the output voltage produced and repeat 
this  measurement  for  frequencies  over  the  range  
10 Hz to 100 kHz, see Table 8.4.  
  Replace  CIN  and  CF with  220  nF  and  22  pF 
capacitors  and  repeat  the  measurements,  this  time 
over  the  extended  frequency  range  from  1  Hz  to  
1 MHz, recording your results in Table 8.5. 
 
Measurements and graphs 
Use the measured value of output voltage at 1 kHz 
for  both  sets  of  measurements, 
to 
in  order 
determine the mid-band voltage gain of the stage.
