Case 2: Roots Real and Equal
For 4b = a2, the roots will be equal and negative, as one can see from Equation (3.2.33).
With s1 = s2 = −a/2 = −α (where α is positive), let us look at the nature of the
transient solution. For the case of real, repeated roots, not only xtr(t) = A1e
−αt satisﬁes the
differential equation, Equation (3.2.28), but also xtr(t ) = A2t e
−αt can be seen to satisfy
Equation (3.2.28). By superposition, the form of the transient solution will be seen to be
−αt = (A1 + A2t ) e
