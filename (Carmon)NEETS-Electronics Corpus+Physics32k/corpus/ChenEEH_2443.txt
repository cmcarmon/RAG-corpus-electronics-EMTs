If the current distribution I(z) is known or can be approxi-
mated by a known function, then the far-ﬁeld of the total
antenna can be obtained using equation 6.150. One would
expect the current distribution to exhibit a standing wave
pattern, with zero current at the ends of the line (z ¼ L=2)
and I ¼ Iin at the center. This behavior is similar to the current
distribution along an open-circuited transmission line, having
propagation constant k0:
