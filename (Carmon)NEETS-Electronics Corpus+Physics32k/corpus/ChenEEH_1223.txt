For long interconnects, wire sizing or spacing, explained in
following subsections, are not sufÔ¨Åcient to limit the intercon-
nect delay. So, buffer insertion is used to trade-off the active
device area for reduction of interconnect delays. The addi-
tional inserted buffers increase the overall gate delay. Thus,
there is an optimal number of repeaters that should be inserted
into an RC line to minimize the overall propagation delay
(Ismail and Friedman, 2001). This trend is qualitatively illus-
trated in Figure 8.7. During the routing of global intercon-
nects, macroblocks form useful routing regions that allow
wires to go through but forbid buffers to be inserted. They
give restrictions on buffer locations. The buffer location re-
strictions have been taken into consideration and the simul-
taneous maze routing and buffer insertion problem have been
solved in polynomial time (Zhou et al., 2000).
