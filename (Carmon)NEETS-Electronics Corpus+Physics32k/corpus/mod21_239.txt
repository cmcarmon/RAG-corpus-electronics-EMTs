Logic probes, as shown in figure 2-26, are extremely simple and useful devices that are designed to
help you detect the logic state of an IC. Logic probes can show you immediately whether a specific point
in the circuit is low, high, open, or pulsing. A high is indicated when the light at the end of the probe is
lit and a low is indicated when the light is extinguished. Some probes have a feature that detects and
displays high-speed transient pulses as small as 5 nanoseconds wide. These probes are usually connected
directly to the power supply of the device being tested, although a few also have internal batteries. Since
most IC failures show up as a point in the circuit stuck either at a high or low level, these probes provide
a quick, inexpensive way for you to locate the fault. They can also display that single, short-duration
pulse that is so hard to catch on an oscilloscope. The ideal logic probe will have the following
characteristics:
