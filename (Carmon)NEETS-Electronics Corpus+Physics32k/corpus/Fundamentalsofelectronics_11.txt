Information can take a variety of forms. When you speak to a friend, your thoughts are translated by
your brain into motor commands that cause various vocal tract components–the jaw, the tongue, the lips–to
move in a coordinated fashion. Information arises in your thoughts and is represented by speech, which must
have a well deﬁned, broadly known structure so that someone else can understand what you say. Utterances
convey information in sound pressure waves, which propagate to your friend’s ear. There, sound energy is
converted back to neural activity, and, if what you say makes sense, she understands what you say. Your
words could have been recorded on a compact disc (CD), mailed to your friend and listened to by her on her
stereo. Information can take the form of a text ﬁle you type into your word processor. You might send the
ﬁle via e-mail to a friend, who reads it and understands it. From an information theoretic viewpoint, all of
these scenarios are equivalent, although the forms of the information representation—sound waves, plastic
and computer ﬁles—are very diﬀerent.
