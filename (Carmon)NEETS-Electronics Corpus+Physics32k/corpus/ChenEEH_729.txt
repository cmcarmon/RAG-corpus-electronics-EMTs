This subsection explains how to use the available trade-offs
between cycle budget for a given task and the related memory
cost. This leads to the use of Pareto curves. Moreover, several
detailed real-life demonstrators are worked out. The data trans-
fer and storage-related cycle budget (‘‘memory cycle budget’’) is
strongly coupled to the memory system cost (both energy and
memory size/area are important here, as mentioned earlier).
A Pareto curve is a powerful instrument for making the right
trade-offs. The Pareto curve only represents the potentially
