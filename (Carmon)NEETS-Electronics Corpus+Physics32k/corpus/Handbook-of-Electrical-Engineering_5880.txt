• Damper windings (armortisseur windings). These are special conducting bars buried in notches on the
rotor surface, and the rotor resembles that of a squirrel-cage-rotor induction machine (see Section 66.2).
The damper windings provide an additional stabilizing force for the machine when it is perturbed from
an equilibrium. As long as the machine is in a steady state, the stator ﬁeld rotates at the same speed as
the rotor, and no currents are induced in the damper windings. That is, these windings exhibit no effect
on a steady-state machine. However, when the speeds of the stator ﬁeld and the rotor become different
(because  of  a  disturbance),  currents  are  induced  in  the  damper  windings  in  such  a  way  as  to  keep,
according to Lenz’s law, the two speeds from separating.
