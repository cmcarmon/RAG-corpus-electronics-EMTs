Replacement for popular ﬂuorescent types includes reduced-wattage energy saving types. These lamps will
meet  the  color  and  efﬁciency  standards,  as  will  the  full  wattage  triphosphor  lamps  having  a  CRI  over  69.
Table 107.11 shows some types of replacement lamps. On the incandescent side, replacements for the standard
incandescent spot and ﬂood lamps will be lower wattage halogen type reﬂector lamps which do meet the LPW
requirements.  The  halogen  and  halogen/infrared  types  of  reﬂector  lamps  will  remain  the  only  type  of  such
lamps on the market. ER and BR types, those intended for rough and vibration service will also be excluded here.
There is also a provision for lighting ﬁxture manufacturers to come up with voluntary luminaire efﬁciency
standards. If these standards are found to be inadequate, the DOE will come up with the mandatory efﬁciency
standards.
