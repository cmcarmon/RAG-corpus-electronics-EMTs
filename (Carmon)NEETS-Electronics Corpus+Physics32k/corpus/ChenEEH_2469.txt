Another common class of antennas make use of additional
material structures, such as a focusing reï¬‚ector or a dielectric
lens structure, surrounding a basic source antenna to achieve
focusing of the antenna radiation. This results in increasing the
antenna gain. Although these structures are not really a part of
the fundamental radiation mechanism, their designs are often
critical for the overall performance of the total antenna system.
