Next, measure the voltage across the resistor. Connect the positive (red) 
multimeter lead to the point where the resistor connects with the positive 
side of the battery pack, and the negative (black) multimeter lead to the 
other side of the resistor. See Figure 3-11. Your voltage reading should be 
close to the one that appears on the multimeter in the figure.
