The design of digital ”movements” is beyond the scope of this chapter, but mechanical meter
movement designs are very understandable. Most mechanical movements are based on the
principle of electromagnetism: that electric current through a conductor produces a magnetic
ﬁeld perpendicular to the axis of electron ﬂow. The greater the electric current, the stronger the
magnetic ﬁeld produced. If the magnetic ﬁeld formed by the conductor is allowed to interact
with another magnetic ﬁeld, a physical force will be generated between the two sources of
ﬁelds. If one of these sources is free to move with respect to the other, it will do so as current
is conducted through the wire, the motion (usually against the resistance of a spring) being
proportional to strength of current.
