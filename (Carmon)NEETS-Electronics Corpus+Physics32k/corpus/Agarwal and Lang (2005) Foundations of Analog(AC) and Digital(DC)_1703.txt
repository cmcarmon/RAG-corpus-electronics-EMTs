s u p p l y In this example, we will analyze the idealized switching charge pump
shown in Figure 12.11. Such charge pumps are used in voltage converters to trans-
late one DC voltage to another DC voltage (for example, from a 1.5-volt battery to an
electronic amplifier circuit that needs a 3-volt DC source). The purpose of the charge
pump is to transfer energy losslessly from the voltage source through the inductor
and into the capacitor. In doing so, it charges the capacitor and builds up the voltage
across it.
