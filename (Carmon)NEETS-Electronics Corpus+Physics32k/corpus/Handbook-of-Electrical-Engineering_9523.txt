Architecture of a DBMS
A DBMS is a complicated software structure that includes several components (see Fig. 94.10). The DBMS has
to interact with the operating system for secondary storage access. The data manager is usually the interface
between the DBMS and the operating system. The DDL compiler converts schema deÔ¨Ånitions, expressed using
DDL statements, into a collection of metadata tables that are stored in the data dictionary. The design of the
schemas is the function of the database administrator (DBA). The DBA is also responsible for specifying the
data  storage  structure  and  access  methodology  and  granting  and  revoking  access  authorizations.  The  query
processor converts high-level DML statements into low-level instructions that the database manager can inter-
pret. The DML preprocessor separates embedded DML statements from the rest of an application program. The
resulting DML commands are processed by a DML compiler, and the rest of the application program is compiled
by a host compiler. The object codes of the two components are then linked.
