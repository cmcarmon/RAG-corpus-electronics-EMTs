This particular circuit board is a computer accessory called a ”modem,” which allows digital
information transfer over telephone lines. There are at least a dozen resistors (all rated at
1/4 watt power dissipation) that can be seen on this modem’s board. Every one of the black
rectangles (called ”integrated circuits” or ”chips”) contain their own array of resistors for their
internal functions, as well.
