Before there were clocks, time was measured by those physical processes which were understandable to each epoch of civilization:
the first appearance (see: heliacal rising) of Sirius to mark the flooding of the Nile each year
the periodic succession of night and day, seemingly eternally
the position on the horizon of the first appearance of the sun at dawn
the position of the sun in the sky
the marking of the moment of noontime during the day
the length of the shadow cast by a gnomon
Eventually, it became possible to characterize the passage of time with instrumentation, using operational definitions. Simultaneously, our conception of time has evolved, as shown below.
