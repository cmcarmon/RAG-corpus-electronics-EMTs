Federal and state laws prohibit discrimination in 
the workplace. State laws may provide different solu-
tions than federal laws. They may, in certain circum-
stances, be favored over federal laws. The types of 
employment discrimination are listed here:
■● Age: The Age Discrimination in Employment Act 
of 1967 (ADEA) provides that no person shall be 
discriminated against because of his or her age. If 
an employer terminates an individual at a  certain 
age and the termination appears to be for no  
other reason than the employee’s age, the former 
employee may have a valid complaint against  
the employer for age discrimination under  
this law.
