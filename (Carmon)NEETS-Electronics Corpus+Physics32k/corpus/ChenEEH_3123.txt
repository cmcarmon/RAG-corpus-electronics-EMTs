V Curve and Capability Curve
Two standard curves that describe the performance and oper-
ating limits of the synchronous machine are the V curve and
the reactive capability curve. The V curve is a plot of the
armature current versus the ﬁeld current at constant real
power. Considering the voltage to be ﬁxed at rated conditions
or 1.0 per unit, then the family of currents whose projection
onto the voltage vector is the same all produce the same real
power. The power factor is varying and the minimum current
occurs at a unity power factor. In the phasor diagram in Figure
4.23, the ﬁeld current is high in the overexcited (generator
lagging power factor) condition and low in the underexcited
(generator leading power factor) cases. Plotting the armature
current versus the ﬁeld current in a small range around unity
power factor, which is the normal operating range of the
machine, the curve is V shaped. A typical curve is shown in
Figure 4.24 for different values of real power.
