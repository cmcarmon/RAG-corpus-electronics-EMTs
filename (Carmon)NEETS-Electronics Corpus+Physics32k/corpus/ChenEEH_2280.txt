The plus sign in this equation is chosen for plane waves
propagating or decaying in the positive z direction, while the
negative sign is for propagation or decay in the minus z
direction. This representation is convenient for plane wave
reï¬‚ection problems, since the characteristic impedance of a
transmission line that models a particular region will then
have a positive characteristic impedance for both upward and
downward propagating plane waves, in agreement with the
usual transmission line convention.
