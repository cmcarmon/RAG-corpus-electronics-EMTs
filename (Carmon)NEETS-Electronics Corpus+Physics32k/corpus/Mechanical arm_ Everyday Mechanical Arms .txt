Every day a person might be using a type of mechanical arm. Many mechanical arms are used for very ordinary things like being able to grab an out of reach object with the pincer mechanical arm. A simple system of 3 joints squeezes and releases motion causing the pincer to close and finally grab a desired object. Even the objects that might seem super simplistic like tweezers can be classified as a mechanical arm. This simple object is being used millions of times daily all thanks to the help of an engineer making a simple, but great design.
