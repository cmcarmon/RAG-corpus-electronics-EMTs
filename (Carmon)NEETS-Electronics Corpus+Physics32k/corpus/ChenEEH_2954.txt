Therefore, from a macroscopic point of view, both of these
mechanisms can be lumped together when characterizing a
device or component in terms of its noise characteristics. The
question then becomes how to best describe a noise source.
The simplest way is to consider a simple resistor. As shown in
Figure 11.1, this may be a noisy resistor or a noiseless resistor.
The noise power available from an arbitrary 1-port network
with an input impedance Z(f ) ¼ R(f ) þ jX(f ) can be ex-
pressed in terms of a noise temperature. If the available noise
power, Pa, is constant over the frequency range of interest, then
a noise temperature can be deﬁned as:
