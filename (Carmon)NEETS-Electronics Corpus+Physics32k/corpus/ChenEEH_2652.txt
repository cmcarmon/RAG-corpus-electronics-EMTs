The second step in the moment method is to expand the un-
known function of the integral equation in terms of basis func-
tions. There are two classes of basis functions. The ﬁrst class is
deﬁned over the entire solution domain and hence called the
entire-domain basis functions. For most electromagnetic prob-
lems, the solution domain is complicated, and it is difﬁcult to
ﬁnd entire-domain basis functions that can form approximately
a complete set over the domain. For this reason, the entire-
domain basis functions have limited use. Contrasted with the
entire-domain basis functions is the second class deﬁned over
small parts of the solution domain. This class is called the sub-
domain basis functions. Although the unknown function over
the entire solution domain can be complicated and cannot be
represented by simple functions, its behavior over a sufﬁciently
small region can be rather simple and hence representable with
simple functions. For this reason, the subdomain basis functions
are widely used in the moment method for a variety of electro-
magnetic problems. In the following subsections, we describe
some commonly used subdomain basis functions.
