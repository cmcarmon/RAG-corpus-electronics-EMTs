because  of  their  gas  absorption  and  oxidation  characteristics.  Mineral  oils  used  for  cable  and  transformer
applications  have  low  polar  molecule  contents  and  are  characterized  by  dielectric  constants  extending  from
about  2.10  to  2.25  with  dissipation  factors  generally  between  2  3  10–5  and  6  3  10–5  at  room  temperature,
depending upon their viscosity and molecular weight. Their dissipation factors increase appreciably at higher
temperatures when the viscosities are reduced. Oils may deteriorate in service due to oxidation and moisture
absorption. Filtering and treatment with Fullers’ earth may improve their properties, but special care must be
taken to ensure that the treatment process does not remove the aromatic constituents which are essential to
maintaining the gas-absorption characteristics of the oil.
