The above chapter section has brieﬂy described some of the techniques of the coupled-circuit approach and
qd0 transformation in modeling, and the treatment of interface and ﬂoating neutral conditions in implementing
a simulation. For more information on modeling and implementation of machine simulations, see [Ong, 1998].
Some techniques of modeling permanent magnet machines are described in [Rahman and Little, 1984; Ong,
