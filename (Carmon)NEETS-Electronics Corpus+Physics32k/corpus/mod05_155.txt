As with electrical loads, the mechanical load connected to a dc motor affects many electrical 
quantities. Such things as the power drawn from the line, amount of current, speed, efficiency, etc., are all 
partially controlled by the size of the load. The physical and electrical characteristics of the motor must be 
matched to the requirements of the load if the work is to be done without the possibility of damage to 
either the load or the motor.
