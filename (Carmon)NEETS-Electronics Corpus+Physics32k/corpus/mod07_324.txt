Figure 3-27 shows an LED and its schematic symbol. The LED is designated by a standard diode 
symbol with two arrows pointing away from the cathode. The arrows indicate light leaving the diode. The 
circuit symbols for all optoelectronic devices have arrows pointing either toward them, if they use light, 
or away from them, if they produce light. The LED operating voltage is small, about 1.6 volts forward 
bias and generally about 10 milliamperes. The life expectancy of the LED is very long, over 100,000 
hours of operation.
