The third generation introduced a second electromagnetic coil in the piston of each damper, improving turn-off response. With the single electromagnetic coil, there was a small delay from when the ECU turned off the current to when the damper lost its magnetic field. This was caused by a temporary electric current, or eddy current, in the electromagnet. BWI greatly reduced this delay with its dual coil system. The two coils are wound in opposite directions to each other, cancelling out the eddy currents. The dual coil system effectively eliminated the delay, causing a quicker responding suspension system.
