All digital computers consist of five basic blocks or 
 sections: control, arithmetic logic unit (ALU),  memory, 
input, and output (Figure 46-1). In some cases the in-
put and output blocks are a single block identified as 
input/output (i/o). Because the  control unit and 
the ALU are closely  related and difficult to separate, 
they may be collectively  referred to as the central 
processing unit (Cpu) or  microprocessing unit 
(mpu).
