Circuit Wizard features a simulation engine based 
on Berkeley SPICE. The component library boasts a 
library of over 1,500 simulated components covering 
everything from simple resistors through ICs. For each 
component there is a choice of either an ideal model 
for teaching theory or a real-world model (similar to 
those found in data books) for circuit design.
