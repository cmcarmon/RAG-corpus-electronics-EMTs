The voltage rating of a fuse is NOT an indication of the voltage the fuse is designed to withstand
while carrying current. The voltage rating indicates the ability of the fuse to quickly extinguish the arc
after the fuse element melts and the maximum voltage the open fuse will block. In other words, once the
fuse has opened, any voltage less than the voltage rating of the fuse will not be able to "jump" the gap of
the fuse. Because of the way the voltage rating is used, it is a maximum rms voltage value. You must
always select a fuse with a voltage rating equal to or higher than the voltage in the circuit you wish to
protect.
