â€¢ U.S. Federal Standard 1016 [National Communications System, 1991] is a 4.8 kbps CELP coder. It has
both long- and short-term linear predictors which are forward adaptive, and so the coder has a relatively
large  delay  (100  msec).  This  coder  produces  highly  intelligible,  good-quality  speech  in  a  variety  of
environments and is robust to independent bit errors.
