where VA is a constant called the Early voltage and is a parameter of the transistor with units of volts. The early
voltage VA is generally in the range of 30 to 300 V for most JFETs. The variation of the drain current with drain
voltage is the result of the channel length modulation effect in which the channel length decreases as the drain
voltage  increases.  This  decrease  in  the  channel  length  results  in  an  increase  in  the  drain  current.  In  BJTs  a
similar effect is the base width modulation effect.
