. For propagation along the principal grid axes f Â¼ 0,
90, a minimum value of ~vvp Â¼ (2=3)c is reached at
Nl Â¼ 3. This sampling density is also the onset of attenu-
ation. As Nl is reduced below 3, ~vvp increases inversely
with Nl. Eventually, ~vvp exceeds c for Nl < 2 and reaches a
limiting velocity of 2c as Nl ! 1. In this limit, as well, the
attenuation constant approaches a value of 2.634 nepers/
cell.
. For propagation along the grid diagonal at f Â¼ 45, a
minimum value of ~vvp Â¼ (

This point is also the onset of exponential attenuation. As
Nl is reduced below 2, ~vvp increases inversely with Nl.
Eventually, ~vvp exceeds c for Nl <
