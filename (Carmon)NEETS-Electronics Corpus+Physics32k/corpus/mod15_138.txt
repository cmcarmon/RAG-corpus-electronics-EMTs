An interesting point about the rotor is that it is never connected to an ac supply and, therefore, 
induces no voltages in the stator coils. As a result, the CT stator currents are determined solely by the 
voltages applied to the high-impedance stator windings. The rotor itself is wound so that its position has 
very little effect on the stator currents. Also, there is never any appreciable current flowing in the rotor 
because its output voltage is always applied to a high-impedance load. As a result, the CT rotor does not 
try to follow the magnetic field of its stator and must be turned by some external force.
