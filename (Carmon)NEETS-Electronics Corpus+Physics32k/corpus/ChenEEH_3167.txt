Flashover due to surges is determined by the shortest
spacing in air between the electrodes of an insulator, called
the dry-arcing distance. Moisture has little effect on the ﬂash-
over voltage due to lightning surges. The ﬂashover voltage
under surges is dependent on the dry-arcing distance. The
ﬂashover under contaminated conditions, however, is depen-
dent on the leakage or creepage distance.
