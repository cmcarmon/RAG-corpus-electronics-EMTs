The PLA is similar to the PAL but has the additional 
flexibility of having its AND gates connected to several 
programmable OR gates. This results in a device that 
is harder to program than the PAL and the additional 
level of logic gates increases the overall propagation 
delay time. Figure 45-35 shows the detailed intercon-
nections. The interconnections start with all fusible 
links in place. The programmer decides which fuses 
will be left intact and which will be blown. The links 
are blown to represent a logic equation.
