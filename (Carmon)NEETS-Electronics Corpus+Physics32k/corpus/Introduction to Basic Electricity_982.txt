antistatic	workstations (Figure 7-12) are de-
signed to provide a ground path for static charges that 
could damage a component. They have a conductive 
or antistatic work surface that is connected to both a 
ground and the worker’s skin through a wrist strap. 
The wrist strap has a minimum of 500 kΩ resistances 
to prevent shock in case of contact with a live circuit. 
When direct grounding is impractical, an ionized air 
blower is required.
