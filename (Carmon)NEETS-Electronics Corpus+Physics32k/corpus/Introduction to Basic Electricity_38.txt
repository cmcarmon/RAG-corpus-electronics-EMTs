Analog	circuits	â€“	these	are	the	categories	of	circuits	that	use	the	concepts	of
parallel	circuits	and	series	circuits	as	basis.	Among	their	fundamental	parts
are	capacitors,	diodes,	resistors,	and	wires.
In	diagrams,	analog	circuits	are	easy	to	recognize.	Usually,	when	a	model
of	 the	 particular	 circuit	 is	 drawn,	 a	 simple	 illustration	 is	 presented	 since
these	 circuits	 do	 not	 follow	 a	 complex	 system.	 In	 most	 cases,	 when
illustrated,	the	parts	(e.g.	capacitors,	diodes,	wires,	etc.)	are	represented	by
