through the electrical conductivity s of the material. The
units of s are siemens per meter [S/m]. The conductivities
for various materials are listed in Table 1.1. It is apparent that
s varies enormously for different materials. The materials near
the top of the table are called conductors, whereas those near
the bottom are called insulators.
