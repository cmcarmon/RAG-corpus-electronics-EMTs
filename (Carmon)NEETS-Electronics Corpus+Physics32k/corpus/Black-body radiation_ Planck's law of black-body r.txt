where
Bν(T) is the spectral radiance (the power per unit solid angle and per unit of area normal to the propagation) density of frequency ν radiation per unit frequency at thermal equilibrium at temperature T.
h is the Planck constant;
c is the speed of light in a vacuum;
k is the Boltzmann constant;
ν is the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation;
T is the absolute temperature of the body.
For a black body surface the spectral radiance density (defined per unit of area normal to the propagation) is independent of the angle

of emission with respect to the normal. However, this means that, following Lambert's cosine law,
