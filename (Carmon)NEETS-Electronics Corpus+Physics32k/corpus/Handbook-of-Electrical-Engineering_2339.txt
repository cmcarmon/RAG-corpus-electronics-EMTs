Low-Frequency Small-Signal Equivalent Circuit Model of a FET. 
 Because the reactances associated with all
the capacitances are very high, one can neglect the capacitances for low-frequency analysis. The gate conductance
as well as the gate-to-source and gate-to-drain resistances can also be neglected in small-signal operation. The
resulting low-frequency equivalent circuit model of a FET is shown in Fig. 22.31.
