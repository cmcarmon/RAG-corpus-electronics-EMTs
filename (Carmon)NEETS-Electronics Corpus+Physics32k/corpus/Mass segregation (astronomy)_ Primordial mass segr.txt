Primordial mass segregation is non-uniform distribution of masses present at the formation of a cluster. The argument that a star cluster is primordially mass segregated is typically based on a comparison of virilization timescales and the cluster's age. However, several dynamical mechanisms to accelerate virilization compared to two-body interactions have been examined. In star-forming regions, it is often observed that O-type stars are preferentially located in the center of a young cluster.
