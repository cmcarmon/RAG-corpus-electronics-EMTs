b. The SPARC does the same sort of thing with a pointer in %o2, except with the difference that it sign-
extends the byte to a longword. Sign extension simply copies the sign-bit into the higher-order bits,
effectively  making  3E  into  0000  003E  or  C2  into  FFFF  FFC2.  That  is  what  the  mnemonic  means:
“LoaD Signed Byte.”
