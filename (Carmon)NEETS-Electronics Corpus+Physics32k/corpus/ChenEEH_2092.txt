A is a function that annotates each arc with a term that
when evaluated (for some binding) results in a multiset
over the associated place’s type. Furthermore, all simple
labels of a compound label must have distinct identiﬁers,
and all simple labels of arcs connected to the same node
must have distinct identiﬁers. Because compound labels
deﬁne data ﬂows as well as control ﬂows, the following
basic control ﬂow patterns (He and Lee, 1991) must be
correctly labeled: (1) data ﬂowing into and out of an
elementary transition must take place concurrently, and
(2) data ﬂowing into and out of an elementary predicate
can occur at different times. Furthermore, data ﬂows
between different levels of hierarchies must be balanced
(i.e., a simple label occurs in a nonterminating arc if and
only if it also appears in an arc with the same direction
connected to the enclosing super node).
