Resistors in parallel
When you combine two resistors in parallel, you connect both sets of ends 
together (see Figure 5­15) so each resistor has the same voltage. By doing so, 
you provide two different paths for current to flow. Even though each resis­
tor is restricting current flow through one circuit path, there’s still another 
path that can draw additional current. From the perspective of the source 
voltage, the effect of arranging resistors in parallel is a decrease in the overall 
resistance.
