Expert  systems  are  computer  programs  that  emulate  the  behavior  of  a  human  expert  in  a  well-bounded
domain  of  knowledge  [Liebowitz,  1988].  They  have  been  used  in  a  number  of  tasks,  ranging  from  sheep
reproduction management in Australia, hurricane damage assessment in the Caribbean, boiler plant operation
in Japan, computer conﬁguration in the United States, to strategic management consulting in Europe [Liebowitz,
1991b]. Expert systems technology has been around since the late 1950s, but it has been only since 1980–1981
that the commercialization of expert systems has emerged [Turban, 1992].
