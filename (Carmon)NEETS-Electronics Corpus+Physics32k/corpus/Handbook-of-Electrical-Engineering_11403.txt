For many years duplex systems, which provide both a two-dimensional image and a Doppler signal, showing
the change of target speed with time, from a particular selected target area, have been in wide use. More recently,
color ﬂow imaging has been employed, which provides a two-dimensional color (typically red or blue) image
of  ﬂow  toward  and  away  from  the  transducer  superimposed  on  the  gray  scale  image  of  stationary  tissue
structures. For these systems the speed, whether from Doppler or time domain detection schemes, is indicated
by color saturation, hue, or luminance. These systems have proven very valuable for detecting the existence of
ﬂow in a region, detecting obstructions to ﬂow and the turbulence associated with this, detecting reduced ﬂow,
and so on. Some other systems add to the color ﬂow image a display of speed versus time for a region that is
deﬁned by a user-movable box.
