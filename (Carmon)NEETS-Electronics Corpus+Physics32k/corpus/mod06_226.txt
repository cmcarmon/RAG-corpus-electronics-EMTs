In view B of the figure, the first positive alternation of a series of ac alternations, Ein is applied to the
circuit. The positive-going voltage causes the left-hand plate of Cc to go positive. The left-hand plate must
lose electrons to go positive. These electrons leave the left-hand plate of Cc and travel to the input source
where they will be coupled to ground. From ground, current flows through Rg causing a negative (bottom)
to positive (top) voltage drop across Rg. In effect, the ac signal has been coupled across the capacitor.
Because of this, capacitors are said to pass the ac signal while blocking dc. (In reality, the ac signal is
coupled around the capacitor.) In view C of the figure, the positive-going voltage at the top of Rg will be
coupled to the grid causing the grid to go positive. The positively charged grid will attract electrons from
the electron stream in the tube. Grid current will flow from the grid to the right-hand plate of Cc. This will
cause the right-hand plate to go negative. (Electrostatic repulsion from the right-hand plate of Cc will
force electrons from the left-hand plate of Cc, causing it to go positive.) The electrons will flow through
the signal source, to ground, from ground to the cathode, from the cathode to the grid, and finally to the
