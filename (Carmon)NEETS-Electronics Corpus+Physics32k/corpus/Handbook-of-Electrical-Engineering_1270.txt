This data matrix is seen to have a Toeplitz structure since the elements along each of its diagonals are equal.
Furthermore, if relationship (14.131) is to have a nontrivial solution, it is clear that the rank of data matrix X
must  be  equal  to  or  less  than p.  These  salient  attributes  play  a  critical  role  in  various  exponential  modeling
algorithms, and they are now formalized.
