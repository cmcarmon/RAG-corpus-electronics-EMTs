The most common device in use for overcurrent protection in high-current circuits today
is the circuit breaker. Circuit breakers are specially designed switches that automatically
open to stop current in the event of an overcurrent condition. Small circuit breakers, such
as those used in residential, commercial and light industrial service are thermally operated.
They contain a bimetallic strip (a thin strip of two metals bonded back-to-back) carrying circuit
current, which bends when heated. When enough force is generated by the bimetallic strip
(due to overcurrent heating of the strip), the trip mechanism is actuated and the breaker will
open. Larger circuit breakers are automatically actuated by the strength of the magnetic Ô¨Åeld
produced by current-carrying conductors within the breaker, or can be triggered to trip by
external devices monitoring the circuit current (those devices being called protective relays).
