This idea of structured VLSI design further inspired the
concept of a silicon compiler, which, in analogy with the
software compiler, would automatically generate a silicon im-
plementation starting from a high-level description. These
pioneering ideas stimulated many important developments in
the IC industry, such as the proliferation of electronic design
automation (EDA) tools, the popularity of semi-custom design
styles (e.g., gate array and standard cell layout), and the avail-
ability of silicon foundry services. By the time of mid-1980s, a
new industry known as application speciÔ¨Åc IC (ASIC) design
started to thrive. Numerous chip sets for video coding, three-
dimensional (3-D) audio processing, and graphic rendering
have been available on the market at appealing costs.
