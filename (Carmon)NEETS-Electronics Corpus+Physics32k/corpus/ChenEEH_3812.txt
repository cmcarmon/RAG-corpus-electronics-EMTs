In Figure 4.6(A), we see the original LENA image. It has
been sampled without aliasing. Figure 4.6(B) shows the LENA
image sampled at a rate much smaller than the minimum
sampling frequencies in the horizontal and vertical directions
necessary to avoid aliasing. Aliasing can be clearly noted. In
Figure 4.6(C), the bandwidth of the image LENA has been
reduced prior to sampling so that aliasing is avoided after
sampling. Figure 4.6(D) shows the Ô¨Åltered image after sam-
pling. We can notice that despite the blur on the image due to
the lower bandwidth, there is indeed less aliasing indicated by
the smoother edges.
