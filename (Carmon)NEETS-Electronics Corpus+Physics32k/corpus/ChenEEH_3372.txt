with the conditions of equations 8.1 and 8.2. Since these
equations are linear, the optimal solution can be computed
by simply freezing Pi at either Pmin; i or Pmax; I whenever the
limit is reached while ﬁnding the optimal solution. Details can
be found in any standard textbook on power system analysis.
The discussion in this section has thus far been focused on
thermal generation plants. The operation costs of a hydroelec-
tric plant are fundamentally different because there are no fuel
costs involved. Here, the concern is to maintain an adequate
level of water storage while maintaining required water ﬂow
through the generator turbines. Clearly, the stored water ca-
pacity depends on water in-ﬂow and out-ﬂow rates, and these
issues are typically studied over longer time horizons as com-
pared to the dispatch of thermal power plants. The problem of
coordinating the generation outputs of hydro generators and
thermal plants for meeting load demands while minimizing
generation costs is called the hydrothermal coordination.
Again, the formulation and solution details can be found in
standard power system textbooks.
