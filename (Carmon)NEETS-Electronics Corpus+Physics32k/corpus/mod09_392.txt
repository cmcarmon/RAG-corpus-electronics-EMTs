As the name implies, the bistable multivibrator has two stable states. If a trigger of the correct 
polarity and amplitude is applied to the circuit, it will change states and remain there until triggered again. 
The trigger need not have a fixed prf; in fact, triggers from different sources, occurring at different times, 
can be used to switch this circuit.
