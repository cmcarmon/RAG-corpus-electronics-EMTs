In a smooth flow, the rate at which the local deformation of the medium is changing over time (the strain rate) can be approximated by a strain rate tensor E(p,t), which is usually a function of the point p and time t. With respect to any coordinate system, it can be expressed by a 3 × 3 matrix.
The strain rate tensor E(p,t) can be defined as the derivative of the strain tensor e(p,t) with respect to time, or, equivalently, as the symmetric part of the gradient (derivative with respect to space) of the flow velocity vector v(p,t):

Either way, the strain rate tensor E(p,t) expresses the rate at which the mean velocity changes in the medium as one moves away from the point p – except for the changes due to rotation of the medium about p as a rigid body, which do not change the relative distances of the particles and only contribute to the rotational part of the viscous stress via the rotation of the individual particles themselves. (These changes comprise the vorticity of the flow, which is the curl (rotational) ∇ × v of the velocity; which is also the antisymmetric part of the velocity gradient ∇v.)
