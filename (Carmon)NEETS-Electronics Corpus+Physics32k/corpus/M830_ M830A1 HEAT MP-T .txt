The M830A1, the M830's successor, provides greater lethality through a higher initial velocity and a multi-purpose fuse. Like the M829 armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) round, it features a discarding sabot around a sub-caliber warhead. The cartridge weighs 49.2 lb (22.3 kg), with the projectile accounting for 25.1 lb (11.4 kg). It is also capable of engaging helicopters. The M830A1 was first fielded in 1994.
