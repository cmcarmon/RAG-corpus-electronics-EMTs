even if carried out perfectly correctly, can provide no guarantee that a particular example of a piece of electronic
equipment will work for any length of time. However, they can provide a reasonable guide to the probability
that something will function as expected over a given time period. The ﬁrst step in estimating the reliability
of a computer system is to determine the likelihood of failure of each of the individual components, such as
resistors, capacitors, integrated circuits, and connectors, that make up the system. This information can then
be used in a full system analysis.
