The analysis and design of complex feedback conﬁgurations
is simpliﬁed by using the general closed-loop block diagram in
Figure 3.2, where w(t ) is the vector of all exogenous inputs,
yK (t ) is the vector of controller outputs, z(t) is the vector of
performance variables, and uK (t) is the vector of inputs to the
controller. The top block is called the two-input and two-
output plant, P, and the bottom one corresponds to the matrix
of controllers denoted by K that is formed after all the con-
trollers have been pulled out of the closed-loop system. As a
