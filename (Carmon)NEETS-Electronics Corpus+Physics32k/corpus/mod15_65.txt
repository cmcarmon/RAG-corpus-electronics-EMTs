The drum or wound rotor has coils wound in slots in a laminated core as shown in figure 1-6. This 
type of rotor is used in most synchro control transformers and differential units, and occasionally in 
torque transmitters. It may be wound continuously with a single length of wire or may have a group of 
coils connected in series. The single continuous winding provides a distributed winding effect for use in 
transmitters. When the rotor is wound with a group of coils connected in series, a concentrated winding 
effect is provided for use in control transformers. When used in differential units, the rotor is wound with 
three coils so their magnetic axes are 120ยบ apart.
