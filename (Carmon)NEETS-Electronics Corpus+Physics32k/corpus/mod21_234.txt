When troubleshooting ICs (either digital or linear), you cannot be concerned with what is going on
inside the IC. You cannot take measurements or conduct repairs inside the IC. You should, therefore,
consider the IC as a black box that performs a certain function. You can check the IC, however, to see
that it can perform its design functions. After you check static voltages and external components
associated with the IC, you can check it for dynamic operation. If it is intended to function as an
amplifier, then you can measure and evaluate its input and output. If it is to function as a logic gate or
combination of gates, it is relatively easy for you to determine what inputs are required to achieve a
desired high or low output. Examples of different types of ICs are provided in figure 2-23.
