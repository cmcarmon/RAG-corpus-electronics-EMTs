When an electron has been excited into the conduction band, the hole left behind in the
valence band is also free to move through the crystal. A quantum mechanical treatment of
this eï¬€ect puts the hole on an approximately equal footing with the electron. Temperature
causes the thermal generation of electron-hole pairs. One of the components of the pair will
add a little to the majority charge carriers. The other component of the electron-hole pair
will become the minority charge carrier. Minority charge carriers limit ideal performance
and increase with increasing temperature.
