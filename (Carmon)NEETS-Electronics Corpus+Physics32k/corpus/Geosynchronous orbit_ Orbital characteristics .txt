Circular Earth geosynchronous orbits have a radius of 42,164 km (26,199 mi). All Earth geosynchronous orbits, whether circular or elliptical, have the same semi-major axis. In fact, orbits with the same period always share the same semi-major axis:

{\displaystyle a={\sqrt[{3}]{\mu \left({\frac {P}{2\pi }}\right)^{2}}}}

where a is the semi-major axis, P is the orbital period, and μ is the geocentric gravitational constant, equal to 398,600.4418 km3/s2.
In the special case of a geostationary orbit, the ground track of a satellite is a single point on the equator. In the general case of a geosynchronous orbit with a non-zero inclination or eccentricity, the ground track is a more or less distorted figure-eight, returning to the same places once per sidereal day.
