The  bandwidth  of  the  ﬁlters  and  the  rate  of  digitization  determine  the  frequency  components  of  interest
that are passed, while other frequencies outside the band of interest that may represent potential artifacts, such
as  aliasing,  are  rejected. A  ﬁlter’s  characteristics  are  determined  by  the  rate  of  the  amplitude  decrease  at  the
bandwidth’s upper and lower edges. Proper digital representation of the analog signal depends on the rate of
data sampling, which is governed by the Nyquist theorem that states that data sampling should be at least twice
the highest frequency of interest.
