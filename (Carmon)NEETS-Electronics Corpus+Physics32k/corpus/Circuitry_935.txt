Decibels (dB) are a convenient means of expressing 
gain  (amplification)  and 
in 
electronic circuits. In this respect, they are used as a 
relative  measure  (i.e.  comparing  one  voltage  with 
another,  one  current  with  another,  or  one  power 
with  another).  In  conjunction  with  other  units, 
decibels  are  sometimes  also  used  as  an  absolute 
measure.  Hence  dBV  are  decibels  relative  to  1V, 
dBm are decibels relative to 1 mW, etc. 
  The decibel is one-tenth of a bel which, in turn, 
is  defined  as  the  logarithm,  to  the  base  10,  of  the 
ratio of output power (Pout) to input power (Pin). 
  Gain  and  loss  may  be  expressed  in  terms  of 
power, voltage and current such that:
