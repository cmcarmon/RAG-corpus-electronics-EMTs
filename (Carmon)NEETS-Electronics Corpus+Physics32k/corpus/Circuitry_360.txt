Now,  suppose  that  we  apply  a  steady  bias  current 
of, say, 70 µA and superimpose on this a signal that 
varies  above  and  below  this  value,  swinging 
through a total change of 100 µA (i.e. from 20 µA 
to 120 µA). Figure 7.24 shows that this produces a 
base-emitter  voltage  change  of  0.05  V.  The  input 
resistance seen by this small-signal input current is 
given by:
