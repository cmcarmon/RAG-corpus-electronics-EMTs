Single-sideband (SSB) AM is obtained by ﬁltering one sideband of the DSB signal. As pointed
out earlier, a DSB SC AM signal required a channel bandwidth of 2W for transmission, where
W is the bandwidth of the baseband signal. However, the two sidebands are redundant. The
transmission of either sideband is sufﬁcient to reconstruct the message signal at the receiver.
Thus, the bandwidth of the transmitted signal is reduced to that of the baseband signal. Figure
15.2.6 illustrates the generation of an SSB AM signal by ﬁltering one of the sidebands (either
USB or LSB) of a DSB SC AM signal. SSB is popular with amateur radio operators because of
its high efﬁciency (ηSSB = 1) and bandwidth savings.
