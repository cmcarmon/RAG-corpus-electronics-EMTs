12.4.13 Consider the machine conﬁguration of Problem
12.4.12. Let the rotor be stationary and constant
direct currents Ia, Ib, and If be supplied to the
windings. Further, let Ia and Ib be equal. If the
rotor is now allowed to move, will it rotate con-
tinuously or will it tend to come to rest? If the
latter, ﬁnd the value of θ for stable equilibrium.
