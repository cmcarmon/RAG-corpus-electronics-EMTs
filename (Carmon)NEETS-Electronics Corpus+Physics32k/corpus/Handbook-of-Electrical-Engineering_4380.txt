surrounded by a cylindrical shell of glass of lower refractive index, called the cladding. Optical ﬁbers (light-
guides) may be classiﬁed in terms of the refractive index proﬁle of the core and whether one mode (single-
mode ﬁber) or many modes (multimode ﬁber) are propagating in the guide (Fig. 42.14). If the core, which is
typically made of a high-silica-content glass or a multicomponent glass, has a uniform refractive index n1, it
is called a step-index ﬁber. If the core has a nonuniform refractive index that gradually decreases from the center
toward the core-cladding interface, the ﬁber is called a graded-index ﬁber. The cladding surrounding the core
has a uniform refractive index n2 that is slightly lower than the refractive index of the core region. The cladding
of the ﬁber is made of a high-silica-content glass or a multicomponent glass. Figure 42.14 shows the dimensions
and  refractive  indexes  for  commonly  used  telecommunication  ﬁbers.  Figure  42.15  enumerates  some  of  the
advantages,  constraints,  and  applications  of  the  different  types  of  ﬁbers.  In  general,  when  the  transmission
medium must have a very high bandwidth—for example, in an undersea or long-distance terrestrial system—a
single-mode  ﬁber  is  used.  For  intermediate  system  bandwidth  requirements  between  200  MHz-km  and
2 GHz-km, such as found in local-area networks, either a single-mode or graded-index multimode ﬁber would
be the choice. For applications such as short data links where lower bandwidth requirements are placed on the
transmission medium, either a graded-index or a step-index multimode ﬁber may be used.
