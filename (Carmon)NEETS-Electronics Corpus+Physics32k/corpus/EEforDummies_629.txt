Suppose that you produce an audio signal as the output of one stage of an 
electronic circuit, and you’d like to amplify it before shipping it off to another 
stage of electronics, such as a speaker. You use a transistor, as shown in 
Figure 10-7, to amplify the small up‐and‐down fluctuations in the audio signal 
(vin), which you input to the base of the transistor (labeled Q in the sche-
matic). The transistor transforms them into large signal fluctuations (vout), 
which appear at the output (collector) of the transistor. Then you take the 
transistor output and apply it to the input of your speakers.
