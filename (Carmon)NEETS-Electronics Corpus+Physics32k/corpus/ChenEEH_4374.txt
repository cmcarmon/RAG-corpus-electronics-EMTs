whenever kx(0)k < d(e).
The behavior of a stable equilibrium point can be depicted
in Figure 2.8 for the case x 2 R2. By choosing the initial points
in a sufﬁciently small neighborhood of the origin speciﬁed by
d, the trajectory of the system can be forced to lie entirely
inside a neighborhood of the origin speciﬁed by e.
The equilibrium xe ¼ 0 of equation 2.2 is asymptotically
