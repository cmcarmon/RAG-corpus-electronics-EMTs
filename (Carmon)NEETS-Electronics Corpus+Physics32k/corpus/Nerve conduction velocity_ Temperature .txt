In general, the conduction velocities of most motor and sensory nerves are positively and linearly associated with body temperature (low temperatures slow nerve conduction velocity and higher temperatures increase conduction velocity).
Conduction velocities in the Sural nerve seem to exhibit an especially strong correlation with the local temperature of the nerve.
