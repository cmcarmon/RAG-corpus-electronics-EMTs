Spread spectrum systems transmit wideband width signals
and attempt to recover the signals in each of the paths and add
them together in a diversity receiver. In the discussion in this
section, we fowson the transmission of narrow band signals.
Therefore, the multipath signals are interference to the desired
signal. We need a receiver that removes the effects of the
multipath signal or cancels the undesired multipaths.
