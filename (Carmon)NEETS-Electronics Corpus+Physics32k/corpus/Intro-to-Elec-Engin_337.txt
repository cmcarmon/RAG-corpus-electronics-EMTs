Conventionally it is assumed that 208 V is the rms value of the line-to-line voltage of the
√
supply system, and the phase sequence is positive, or A–B–C, unless mentioned otherwise. The
3, or 120 V. Selecting the
magnitude of the line-to-neutral (or phase) voltages is given by 208/
line currents returning through the neutral conductor, as shown in Figure 4.2.2, we have
