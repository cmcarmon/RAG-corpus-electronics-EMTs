conduction band of the n region directly into the valence band of the p region. Tunnel diodes create a negative
differential  resistance  in  the  forward  direction,  due  to  the  tunnel  effect.  Tunnel  diodes  are  used  as  mixers,
oscillators, ampliÔ¨Åers, and detectors. They operate at very high frequencies in the gigahertz bands.
