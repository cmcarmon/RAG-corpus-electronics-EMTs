A quantum dot single-photon source is based on a single quantum dot placed in an optical microcavity. It is an on-demand single photon source. A pulsed laser can excite a pair of carriers known as an exciton in the quantum dot. Due to the discrete energy levels only one exciton can exist in the cavity at a given time. The decay of the exciton due to spontaneous emission leads to the emission of a single photon. It is a nonclassical light source that shows photon antibunching. The emission of single photons can be proven by measuring the second order intensity correlation function. The linewidth of the emitted photons can be reduced by using distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRâ€™s). Additionally, DBR's lead to an emission in a well-defined direction.
