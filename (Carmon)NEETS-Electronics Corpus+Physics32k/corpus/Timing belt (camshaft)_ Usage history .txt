The first known timing belt was used in 1945. In the 1950s, Bill Devin built a Panhard racing special with a highly modified engine using Norton Manx cylinders and heads and a toothed rubber belt driving the overhead camshaft on each Norton cylinder head. Devin's Panhard special won the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) National Championship in 1956.
The 1962 Glas 1004 was the first mass-produced vehicle to use an overhead camshaft engine with a timing belt. In 1966, Vauxhall Motors started production of the Slant Four overhead cam four-cylinder design which used a timing belt, a configuration that is now used in the vast majority of cars built today.
Fiat's 124 twin cam engine developed in the mid 1960's was the first mass production engine to have belt-driven twin camshafts.
