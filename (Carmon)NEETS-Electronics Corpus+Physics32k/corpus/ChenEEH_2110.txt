Furthermore, operation overriding can be achieved through
a super transition in an HPrTN such that the ﬁring of a
particular component transition is determined partly by the
(dynamic) instantiation of an object identiﬁer (and thus its
sort). The use of the above case-like net structure in realizing
polymorphism can be avoided in the implementation of an
HPrTN.
