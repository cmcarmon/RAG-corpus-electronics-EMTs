It  is  important  to  determine  the  values  of  system  voltages  and  currents  during  faulted  conditions  so  that
protective devices may be set to detect and minimize their harmful effects. The time constants of the associated
transients are such that sinusoidal steady-state methods may still be used. The method of symmetrical com-
ponents is particularly suited to fault analysis.
