Information about the position of the object is present visually when the reception of an echo causes
the movement or appearance of a spot of light on a cathode-ray tube (crt). The crt requires a signal on the
order of at least several volts for proper operation and will not respond to the high frequencies within a
return pulse. Therefore, a receiver amplifier and detector must be used that are capable of producing a
visible indication on the cathode-ray tube under the following conditions: (1) when the input signal to the
amplifier is in the form of pulses of extremely high-frequency, (2) the amplitude of the pulses is in the
microvolt range, and (3) the pulses last for only a few microseconds.
