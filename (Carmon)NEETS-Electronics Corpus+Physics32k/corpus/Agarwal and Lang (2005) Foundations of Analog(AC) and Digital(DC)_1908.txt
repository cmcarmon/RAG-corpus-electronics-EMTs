function of time for a given input signal also specified as a function of time. For
example, as shown in Figure 10.2, the step response of an RC network plotted
the output voltage of an RC network as a function of time in response to a
step input. In contrast, the frequency response represents a frequency domain
analysis in which output behavior is presented as a function of input frequency.
In a frequency domain analysis our goal is to determine the magnitude and phase
of the output in response to an input sinusoidal signal of a given frequency in
steady state.
