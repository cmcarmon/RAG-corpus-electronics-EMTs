TGA can be used to evaluate the thermal stability of a material. In a desired temperature range, if a species is thermally stable, there will be no observed mass change. Negligible mass loss corresponds to little or no slope in the TGA trace. TGA also gives the upper use temperature of a material. Beyond this temperature the material will begin to degrade.
TGA is used in the analysis of ceramics and thermally stable polymers. Ceramics usually melt before they decompose as they are thermally stable over a large temperature range, thus TGA is mainly used to investigate the thermal stability of polymers. Most polymers melt or degrade before 200°C. However, there is a class of thermally stable polymers that are able to withstand temperatures of at least 300°C in air and 500°C in inert gases without structural changes or strength loss, which can be analyzed by TGA.
