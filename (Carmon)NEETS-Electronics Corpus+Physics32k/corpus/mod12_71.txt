First, the current through the device must be measured as the voltage is varied. Then the current and 
voltage values can be plotted on a graph, such as the one shown in view (B), to determine the impedance 
of the device. For example, assume the voltage is varied from 0 to 200 volts in 50-volt steps, as shown in 
view (B). At the first 50-volt point, the ammeter reads 0.5 ampere. These ordinates are plotted as point a 
in view (B). With 100 volts applied, the ammeter reads 1 ampere; this value is plotted as point b. As these 
steps are continued, the values are plotted as points c and d. These points are connected with a straight 
line to show the linear relationship between current and voltage. For every change in voltage applied to 
the device, a proportional change occurs in the current through the device. When the change in current is 
proportional to the change in applied voltage, the impedance of the device is linear and a straight line is 
developed in the graph.
