▶✓ A terminal and terminal block work together as the simplest type of con-
nector. A terminal block contains sets of screws in pairs. You attach the 
block to the case or chassis of your project. Then, for each wire you 
want to connect, you solder (or crimp) a wire to a terminal. Next, you 
connect each terminal to a screw on the block. When you want to con-
nect two wires, simply choose a pair of screws and connect the terminal 
on each wire to one of those screws.
