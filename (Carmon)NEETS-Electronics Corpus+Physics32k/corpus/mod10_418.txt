The rigid line has the following disadvantages: (1) it is expensive to construct; (2) it must be kept dry
to prevent excessive leakage between the two conductors; and (3) although high-frequency losses are
somewhat less than in previously mentioned lines, they are still excessive enough to limit the practical
length of the line.
