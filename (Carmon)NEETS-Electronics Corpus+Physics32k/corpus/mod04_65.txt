A sharp knife may be used to strip the insulation from a conductor. The procedure is much the same 
as for sharpening a pencil. The knife should be held at approximately a 60ยบ  angle to the conductor. Use 
extreme care when cutting through the insulation to avoid nicking or cutting the conductor. This 
procedure produces a taper on the cut insulation as shown in figure 2-3.
