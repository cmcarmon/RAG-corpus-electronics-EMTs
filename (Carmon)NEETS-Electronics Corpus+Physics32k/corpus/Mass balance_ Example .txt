Consider a bathtub in which there is some bathing salt dissolved. We now fill in more water, keeping the bottom plug in. What happens?
Since there is no reaction,




P

D

=
0


{\displaystyle \mathrm {PROD} =0}
and since there is no outflow



Q
=
0


{\displaystyle Q=0}
. The mass balance becomes



or

Using a mass balance for total volume, however, it is evident that






d

d

=

Q

{\displaystyle {\frac {dV}{dt}}=Q_{0}}
and that



V

{\displaystyle V=V_{t=0}+Q_{0}t}
. Thus we get

Note that there is no reaction and hence no reaction rate or rate law involved, and yet

{\displaystyle {\frac {dC_{\mathrm {A} }}{dt}}\neq 0}
. We can thus draw the conclusion that reaction rate can not be defined in a general manner using






d

d

{\displaystyle {\frac {dC}{dt}}}
. One must first write down a mass balance before a link between






d

d

{\displaystyle {\frac {dC}{dt}}}
and the reaction rate can be found. Many textbooks, however, define reaction rate as

without mentioning that this definition implicitly assumes that the system is closed, has a constant volume and that there is only one reaction.
