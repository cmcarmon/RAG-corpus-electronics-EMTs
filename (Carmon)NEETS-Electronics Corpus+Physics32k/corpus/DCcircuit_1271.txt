There are three basic factors of capacitor construction determining the amount of capacitance
created. These factors all dictate capacitance by affecting how much electric ﬁeld ﬂux (relative
difference of electrons between plates) will develop for a given amount of electric ﬁeld force
(voltage between the two plates):
