Figure 6.17: The steps in transmitting digital information are shown in the upper system, the Funda-
mental Model of Communication. The symbolic-valued signal s (m) forms the message, and it is encoded
into a bit sequence b (n). The indices diï¬€er because more than one bit/symbol is usually required to
represent the message by a bitstream. Each bit is represented by an analog signal, transmitted through
