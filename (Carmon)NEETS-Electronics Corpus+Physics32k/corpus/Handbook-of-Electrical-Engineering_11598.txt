HE GREAT ACHIEVEMENTS in engineering deeply affect the lives of all of us and also serve to remind
us of the importance of mathematics. Interest in mathematics has grown steadily with these engineering
achievements and with concomitant advances in pure physical science. Whereas scholars in nonscien-
tiﬁc ﬁelds, and even in such ﬁelds as botany, medicine, geology, etc., can communicate most of the problems
and results in nonmathematical language, this is virtually impossible in present-day engineering and physics.
Yet  it  is  interesting  to  note  that  until  the  beginning  of  the  twentieth  century  engineers  regarded  calculus  as
something of a mystery. Modern students of engineering now study calculus, as well as differential equations,
complex variables, vector analysis, orthogonal functions, and a variety of other topics in applied analysis. The
study of systems has ushered in matrix algebra and, indeed, most engineering students now take linear algebra
as a core topic early in their mathematical education.
