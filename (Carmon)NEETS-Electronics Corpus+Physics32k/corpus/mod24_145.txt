In addition to bound and refracted modes, there are leaky modes. Leaky modes are similar to leaky
rays. Leaky modes lose power as they propagate along the fiber. For a mode to remain within the core, the
mode must meet certain boundary conditions. A mode remains bound if the propagation constant b meets
the following boundary condition:
