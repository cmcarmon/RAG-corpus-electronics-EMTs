This straight-line equation 1.84 is also drawn in Figure 1.9.
The intersections of this ‘‘load line’’ (Bozorth, 1978, Ch. 9)
with the hysteresis curve give the two possible solutions
for B in the permanent-magnet circuit of Figure 1.8. The actual
operating point depends on the previous time history because
this is a nonlinear circuit. Nevertheless, note from this example
that the second quadrant of the hysteresis curve (which is
symmetrical with the fourth) is the important quadrant. This
illustrates why the second quadrant is used as a measure of
comparison for magnets, as shown in Figure 1.7.
