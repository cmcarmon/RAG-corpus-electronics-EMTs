Older  style  ECG  machines  recorded  one  lead  at  a  time,  then  evolved  to  three  simultaneous  leads.  This
necessitated the use of switching circuits as well as analog weighting circuits to generate the various 12 leads.
This  is  usually  eliminated  in  modern  digital  systems  by  using  an  individual  single-ended  ampliﬁer  for  each
electrode on the body. Each potential signal is then digitally converted and all of the ECG leads can be formed
mathematically in software. This would necessitate a nine-ampliﬁer system. By performing some of the lead
calculations with the analog differential ampliﬁers this can be reduced to an eight-channel system. Thus only
