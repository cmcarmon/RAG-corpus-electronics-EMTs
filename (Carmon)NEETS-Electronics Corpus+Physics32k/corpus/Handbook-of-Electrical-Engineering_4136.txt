The EUT is placed on a nonconducting table 0.8 m above the ground plane ï¬‚oor. The receiving antenna is
placed at the prescribed measurement distance (R) from the system (3 m for Class B and 10 m for Class A)
and is scanned from 1 to 4 m in height while the EUT is rotated 360 degrees. The maximum emission data
(per azimuth, elevation, and antenna orientation) is collected over the appropriate frequency range.
