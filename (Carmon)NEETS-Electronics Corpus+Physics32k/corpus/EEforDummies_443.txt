▶✓ Charging: As the capacitor begins to charge, it develops a voltage, so 
the resistor voltage begins to fall, which in turn reduces the charging 
current. The capacitor continues to charge, but at a slower rate because 
the charging current has decreased. As Vc continues to increase,  
Vr continues to decrease, so the current continues to decrease.
