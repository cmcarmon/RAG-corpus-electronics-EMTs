A Goniophotometer is a device used for measurement of the light emitted from an object at different angles. The use of goniophotometers has been increasing in recent years with the introduction of LED-light sources, which are mostly directed light sources, where the spatial distribution of light is not homogeneous. If a light source is homogeneous in its distribution of light, it is called a Lambertian source. Due to strict regulations, the spatial distribution of light is of high importance to automotive lighting and its design.
