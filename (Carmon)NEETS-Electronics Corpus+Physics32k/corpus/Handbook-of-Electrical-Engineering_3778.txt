Attenuation is a function of the cumulative rain-rate distribution, drop-size distribution, refractive index of
water, temperature, and other variables. A rigorous calculation of g(R) incorporating raindrop-size distribution,
velocity of raindrops, and refractive index of water can be found in Sadiku [1992]. For practical engineering
purposes, what is needed is a simple formula relating attenuation to rain parameters. Such is found in the aRb
empirical relationship, which has been used to calculate rain attenuation directly [Collin, 1985], i.e.,
