comparison with the expected voltage in the voltage charts. When checking voltages, remember that a
voltage reading can be obtained across a resistance, even if that resistance is open. The resistance of the
meter itself forms a circuit resistance when the meter probes are placed across the open resistance.
Therefore, the voltage across the component may appear to be normal or near-normal as you read the
meter, but may actually be abnormal when the meter is disconnected from the circuit.
