The vertical deflection of the beam is increased as the output of the amplitude detector increases. The
horizontal position is controlled by the frequency control section and is the frequency analyzed at that
instant. The beam sweeps from left to right, low to high frequencies during its analysis. During this
analysis, any time a signal is discovered, a vertical deflection will show the strength of the signal at the
horizontal position that is the frequency. This results in a display of amplitude as a function of frequency.
