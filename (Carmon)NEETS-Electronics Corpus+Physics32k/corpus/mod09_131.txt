One example of a filter being applied is in a rectifier circuit. As you know, an alternating voltage is 
changed by the rectifier to a direct current. However, the d.c. voltage is not pure; it is still pulsating and 
fluctuating. In other words, the signal still has an a.c. component in addition to the d.c. voltage. By 
feeding the signal through simple filter networks, the a.c. component is reduced. The remaining d.c. is as 
pure as the designers require.
