The clip-type fuseholder is used for cartridge fuses. The ferrules or knife blade of the fuse are held
by the spring tension of the clips. These clips provide the electrical connection between the fuse and the
circuit. If a glass-bodied fuse is used, the fuse can be inspected visually for an open without removing the
fuse from the fuse holder. Clip-type fuseholders are made in several sizes to hold the many styles of fuses.
The clips maybe made for ferrules or knife blade cartridge fuses. While the base of a clip-type fuseholder
is made from insulating material, the clips themselves are conductors. The current through the fuse goes
through the clips and care must be taken to not touch the clips when there is power applied. If the clips are
touched, with power applied, a severe shock or a short circuit will occur.
