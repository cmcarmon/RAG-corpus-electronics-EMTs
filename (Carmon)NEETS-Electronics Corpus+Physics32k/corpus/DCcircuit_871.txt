The Seebeck effect is fairly linear; that is, the voltage produced by a heated junction of
two wires is directly proportional to the temperature. This means that the temperature of the
metal wire junction can be determined by measuring the voltage produced. Thus, the Seebeck
effect provides for us an electric method of temperature measurement.
