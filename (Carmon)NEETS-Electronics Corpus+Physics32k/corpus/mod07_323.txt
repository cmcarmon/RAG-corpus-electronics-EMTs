OPTOELECTRONIC devices either produce light or use light in their operation. The first of these, 
the light-emitting diode (LED), was developed to replace the fragile, short-life incandescent light bulbs 
used to indicate on/off conditions on panels. A LIGHT-EMITTING DIODE is a diode which, when 
forward biased, produces visible light. The light may be red, green, or amber, depending upon the 
material used to make the diode.
