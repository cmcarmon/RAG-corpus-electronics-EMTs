The following describes how the system would activate on the earlier version installed during the 1980s on two stage TEMS
During normal running 100 km/h (62 mph)
The system chooses the "SOFT" selection, to provide a softer ride.
At high speeds 85–100 km/h (53–62 mph)
The system selects the "HARD" selection and determines that at high speeds, it assumes a more rigid configuration for better ride stability, and to reduce roll tendencies.
Braking (reducing speed to 50 km/h (31 mph))
In order to prevent “nose dive”, the process proceeds to "HARD" automatically damping force until it senses the brakes to be at the"SOFT" setting. It will return to the "SOFT" state when the brake light is off, and the pedal has been released after 2 seconds or more.
(Only 3-stage systems) during hard acceleration
To suppress suspension “squat” the system switches to "HARD" based on accelerator pedal position and throttle position.
(Only 3-stage systems) during hard cornering
To suppress suspension “roll” the system switches to "HARD" based on steering angle sensor position.
SPORT mode
The system remains in the "HARD" position regardless of driving conditions. (For 3-stage systems, the system chooses the “MID” configuration)
