FIGURE  47.2
Schematic  diagram  of  a  typical  SAW  bidirectional  ﬁlter  consisting  of  two  interdigital  transducers.  The
transducers need not be identical. The input transducer launches waves in either direction and the output transducer converts
the acoustic energy back to an electrical signal. The device exhibits a minimum 6-dB insertion loss. Acoustic absorber damps
unwanted SAW energy to eliminate spurious reﬂections which could cause distortions.
