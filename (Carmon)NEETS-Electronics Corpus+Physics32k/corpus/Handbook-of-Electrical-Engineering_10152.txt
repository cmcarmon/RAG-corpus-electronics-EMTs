The term G(q) contains all the terms involving gravitational constant g. Note that these terms depend only
on the position of the arm in the gravitational ﬁeld. If the arm is operating in the gravity-free environment,
then these terms become zero. The term V·q  reﬂects the frictional forces present in the robot system. In our
example,  these  terms  are  assumed  to  be  zero.  However,  in  practical  robots  a  substantial  amount  of  friction
stiction can be present that if not considered will overestimate the torque available for accelerating the joints.
The above example illustrates that the existence of signiﬁcant coupling between the joints, if ignored, can
cause positioning and tracking errors when the joints are moving simultaneously. However, all these coupling
terms become small at low speeds. In this case, independent joint control with appropriate compensations as
discussed earlier may be quite adequate. As the operational speeds increase, one needs to take into consideration
the full dynamics in the development of control algorithms.
