Figure 3-50, view (A), shows the schematic diagram of a trapezoidal generator. The waveshapes for 
the circuit are shown in view (B). R1 provides forward bias for Q1 and, without an input gate, Q1 
conducts very hard (near saturation), C1 couples the input gate signal to the base of Q1. R2, R3, and C2 
form the RC network which forms the trapezoidal wave. The output is taken across R3 and C2.
