is a general solution or a total solution to Equation 10.2. vCH(t) is called the
homogeneous solution and vCP(t) is called the particular solution. When dealing
with circuit responses, the homogeneous solution is also called the natural
response of the circuit because it depends only on the internal energy storage
properties of the circuit and not on external inputs. The particular solution is
also called the forced response or the forced solution because it depends on the
external inputs to the circuit.
