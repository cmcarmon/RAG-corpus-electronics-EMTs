Attenuation because of raindrops is greater than attenuation because of other forms of precipitation. 
Attenuation may be caused by absorption, in which the raindrop, acting as a poor dielectric, absorbs 
power from the radio wave and dissipates the power by heat loss or by scattering (fig. 2-24). Raindrops 
cause greater attenuation by scattering than by absorption at frequencies above 100 megahertz. At 
frequencies above 6 gigahertz, attenuation by raindrop scatter is even greater.
