Conductor splices and connections are an essential part of any electrical circuit. When conductors 
join each other or connect to a load, splices or terminals must be used. Therefore, it is important that they 
be properly made. Any electrical circuit is only as good as its weakest link. The basic requirement of any 
splice or connection is that it be both mechanically and electrically as sound as the conductor or device 
with which it is used. Quality workmanship and materials must be used to ensure lasting electrical 
contact, physical strength, and insulation. The most common methods of making splices and connections 
in electrical cables is explained in the discussion that follows.
