Externally applied electric currents can excite nerve and muscle cells. Muscle can be stimulated directly or
indirectly through the nerves that enervate the muscle. Thresholds of stimulation of nerve are generally well
below thresholds for direct stimulation of muscle. An understanding of neuroelectric principles is a valuable
foundation for investigation into both sensory and muscular responses to electrical stimulation.
