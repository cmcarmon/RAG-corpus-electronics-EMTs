The six determinants of gait have been long-lasting theories of gait that have been extensively studied biomechanically. These six kinematics or determinants of gait were established by Saunders et al. [1] in 1953. Due to the extensive studies in these determinants, they have gone through various refinements over the past five decade, which have led to either authentication, acceptance or disputation of each of the six determinants of gait. The six determinants of gait have been predominantly embraced as a fact for half a decade since its proposition, and have made appearances in various literature, but without extensive testing. Albeit, recent studies have depicted that, the first three determinants might actually contribute marginally or far less to reducing the vertical displacement of the center of mass (COM).
These determinants of gait are known to ensure economical locomotion, by the reduction in vertical center of mass (COM) excursion leading to reduction in metabolic energy. It is therefore suggested that the precise control of these determinants, also referred to as kinematic features of gait  leads to increased energy conservation. These kinematic features of gait are integrated or coordinated in order to ensure a circular arc trajectory of the COM, as theory proposed as the 'compass gait (straight knee)'. The theory underlying the determinants run contrary to that of the 'inverted pendulum' theory with a static stance leg acting as a pendulum that prescribes an arc. The six determinants of gaits and their effects on COM displacement and energy conservation are described below in chronological order;
