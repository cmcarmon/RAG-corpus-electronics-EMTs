Recognizers can also be categorized by the speaking styles, vocabularies, and language models they accom-
modate. Isolated word recognizers require speakers to insert brief pauses between individual words. Contin-
uous speech recognizers operate on ﬂuent speech, but typically employ strict language models, or grammars,
to limit the number of allowable word sequences. Wordspotters also accept ﬂuent speech as input. However,
rather than providing full transcription, wordspotters selectively locate relevant words or phrases in an utter-
ance. Wordspotting is useful both in information-retrieval tasks based on keyword indexing and as an alternative
to isolated word recogniton in voice command applications.
