The second type of complement is the difference between a number and the next higher power of the
number base. As an example, the next higher power of 10 above 999 is 1,000. The difference between
1,000 and 254 is 746. This is called the tens complement in the decimal number system. It is also called
the radix or R’s complement. We will use complements to subtract. Let’s look at the magic of this process.
There are three important points we should mention before we start: (1) Never complement the minuend
in a problem, (2) always disregard any carry beyond the number of positions of the largest of the original
numbers, and (3) add the R’s complement of the original subtrahend to the original minuend. This will
have the same effect as subtracting the original number. Let’s look at a base ten example in which we
subtract 38 from 59:
