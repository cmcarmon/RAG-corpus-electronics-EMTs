In LiNbO3-based integrated optics, optical waveguides are formed in one of two ways. The ﬁrst uses photo-
lithographically  patterned  lines  of  titanium  (Ti),  several  hundred  angstroms  thick,  on  the  substrate  surface.
The titanium is then diffused into the substrate surface at a temperature of about 1000(cid:176)C for several hours.
This process locally raises the refractive index in the regions where titanium has been diffused, forming high-
refractive  index  stripes  that  will  conﬁne  and  guide  light.  Because  the  diffusion  is  done  at  exceedingly  high
temperatures,  the  waveguide  stability  is  excellent.  The  waveguide  mechanism  used  is  similar  to  that  used  in
ﬁber optics, where the higher-index, doped cores guide the light. The exact titanium stripe width, the titanium
thickness,  and  diffusion  process  are  critical  parameters  in  implementing  a  low-loss  single-mode  waveguide.
Different fabrication recipes are required to optimize the waveguides for operation at the three standard diode
laser wavelengths: 800 nm, 1300 nm, and 1500 nm. The second approach uses a technique known as proton
exchange. In this approach, a mask is used to deﬁne regions of the substrate where hydrogen will be exchanged
for  lithium,  resulting  in  an  increase  in  the  refractive  index.  This  reaction  takes  place  at  lower  temperatures
(200–250(cid:176)C)  but  has  been  found  to  produce  stable  waveguides  if  an  anneal  at  350–400(cid:176)C  is  performed.
Waveguides  formed  using  the  proton  exchange  method  support  only  one  polarized  mode  of  propagation,
whereas  those  formed  using  Ti  indiffusion  support  two.  Proton  exchange  waveguides  are  also  capable  of
handling much higher optical power densities, especially at the shorter wavelengths, than are those formed by
Ti indiffusion. More fabrication detail will be provided later.
