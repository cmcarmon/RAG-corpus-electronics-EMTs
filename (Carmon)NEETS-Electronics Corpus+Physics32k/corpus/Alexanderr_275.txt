Probably the most important part of design is clearly deÔ¨Åning what
the system, component, process, or, in our case, problem is. Rarely is
an engineer given a perfectly clear assignment. Therefore, as a student,
you  can  develop  and  enhance  this  skill  by  asking  yourself,  your  col-
leagues,  or  your  professors  questions  designed  to  clarify  the  problem
statement.
