9‐volt  battery.  That’s  because  the  six  series 
batteries  contain  more  chemicals  than  the 
single  battery,  and  can  produce  more  cur­
rent over time before becoming depleted. (In 
Chapter 3, I discuss how batteries are made 
and why they eventually run out of juice.) If 
you have a project that uses a lot of current, 
or you plan to run your circuit all the time, con­
sider using larger C‐ or D‐size batteries, which 
last  longer  than  smaller  batteries  or  most 
rechargeable batteries.
See  the  section  “Sorting  batteries  by  what’s 
inside” for more about different types of batter­
ies and how long you can expect them to last.
