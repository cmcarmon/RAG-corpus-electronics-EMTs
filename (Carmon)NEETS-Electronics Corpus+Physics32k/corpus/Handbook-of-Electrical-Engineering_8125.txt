When an electric ﬁeld (greater than the critical ﬁeld) is applied between the transparent electrodes, usually
conductive indium–tin oxide (ITO) thin ﬁlms, the 90-degree twist in the crystal is destroyed as the molecules
align parallel to the ﬁeld, so that the rotation of the light’s plane of polarization cannot be sustained. Conse-
quently, the crossed polarizers effectively block reﬂection of the incident light from the backing mirror, and
the  surface  appears  to  be  dark,  with  excellent  contrast  to  the  light  gray  color  of  the  device  in  the  reﬂecting
mode. The contrast ratio can be further enhanced by the use of the super twisted nematic crystal, where the
molecular orientation is rotated through 270 degrees rather than 90 degrees.
