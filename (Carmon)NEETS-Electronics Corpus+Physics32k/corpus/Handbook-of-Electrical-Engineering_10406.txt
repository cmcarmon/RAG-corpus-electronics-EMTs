i. Software techniques. With the growing computational power and memory capability of microprocessor
systems, C3 system performance will increasingly be determined by software performance. The cost and
complexity  of  software  appears  to  expand  in  proportion  to  host  computer  capability  and  is  more
frequently becoming a system limiting factor. ADA is dictated to be the common programming language
of the Defense Department; however, exceptions can be approved. Veriﬁcation and validation (V&V) of
generated software and software maintainence have grown to necessitate organizational changes within
the military. Software standards have also increased in importance in new C3 systems. POSIX standards
(published  as  IEEE 1003)  govern  the  software  interfaces  to  operating  system  services  in  various  com-
puting  platforms  [NIST,  1990].  As  such,  they  allow  application  programs  written  according  to  the
standards to be reused. POSIX standardizes interfaces to security, networking, and diverse system services,
including  ﬁle  management,  memory  and  process  management,  and  system  administration  services.
POSIX.5 provides bindings for the ADA programming language.
