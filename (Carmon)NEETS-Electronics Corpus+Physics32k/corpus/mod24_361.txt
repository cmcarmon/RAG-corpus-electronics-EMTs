Most newer connectors are designed so that the connector ferrule end faces contact when the
connector is mated. The connector can be assembled onto the fiber so that the fibers also contact when
mated. However, they also can be assembled so that the fibers do not. Whether or not the fibers contact is
determined by whether the fiber sticks out slightly from the ferrule or is recessed inside the ferrule. The
fiber position can be controlled by the connector polishing technique. The physical contact (PC) polish
technique was developed for most connectors so that the fibers would touch when mated. In these types of
connectors, index gel is not needed to reduce reflections.
