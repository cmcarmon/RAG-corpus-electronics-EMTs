In a synchro system that uses a CT, stator current at correspondence is also greater than in a TX-TR 
system. In this case, however, this reason is that the CT rotor is not energized and as a result no voltage is 
induced in the stator to oppose the voltage in the transmitter stator. The overall effect of this increase in 
stator current is to reduce the accuracy of the system. To maintain high accuracy in a synchro system 
containing either differential units or CTs, the stator currents must be kept to a minimum. This is done by 
connecting synchro capacitors in the circuit.
