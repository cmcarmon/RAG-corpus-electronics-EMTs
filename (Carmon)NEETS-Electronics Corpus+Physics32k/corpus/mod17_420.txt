FACSIMILE (fax) is a method of transmitting still images over an electrical communications 
system. The images, called "pictures" or "copy" in fax terminology, may be weather maps, photographs, 
sketches, typewritten or printed text, or handwriting. Figure 3-32 shows a facsimile transceiver. You must 
realize that the still image serving as the fax copy or picture cannot be transmitted instantly in its entirety. 
Three distinct operations are performed. These are (1) scanning, (2) transmitting, and (3) recording or 
receiving.
