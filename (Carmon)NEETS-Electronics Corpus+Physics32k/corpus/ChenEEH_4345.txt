Following what is known about polynomials, complex char-
acteristic values occur in complex conjugate pairs, as do their
associated characteristic vectors. Characteristic values are
unique although characteristic vectors are not. This makes
their actual computation (e.g., using MATLAB) somewhat
arbitrary. The function poly(A) returns the characteristic poly-
nomial for a matrix A. Then the roots command can be
utilized to Ô¨Ånd the characteristic values although this is not a
