Knowing that electrically common points have zero voltage drop between them is a valuable
troubleshooting principle. If I measure for voltage between points in a circuit that are supposed
to be common to each other, I should read zero. If, however, I read substantial voltage between
those two points, then I know with certainty that they cannot be directly connected together.
If those points are supposed to be electrically common but they register otherwise, then I know
that there is an ”open failure” between those points.
