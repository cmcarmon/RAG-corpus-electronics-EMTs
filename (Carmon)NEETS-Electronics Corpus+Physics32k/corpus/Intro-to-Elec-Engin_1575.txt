output.
(iii) Check whether the original sequence
{bk} is recovered in both cases, when{ak}
of (i) and (ii) is put through a differential
decoder, as shown in Figure P15.3.11.
(c) For the ﬁrst 10 digits of the sequence {bk}, il-
lustrate the Manchester-formatted waveform.
*15.3.12 An audio message is band-limited to 15 kHz, sam-
pled at twice the Nyquist rate, and encoded by
a 12-bit natural binary code that corresponds to
Lb = 212 = 4096 levels, all of which span the
message’s variations. Find the ﬁrst-null bandwidth
(given by ωb/2π = 1/Tb) required to support a
polar waveform format. Also, determine the best
possible signal-to-noise ratio S0/Nq with a crest
factor of 3.8.
15.3.13 In Equation (15.3.24), for polar and Manchester
PCM, Eb = A2Tb. Find the noise level N0/2 at the
input to the polar PCM receiver that corresponds
to Pe = 10
