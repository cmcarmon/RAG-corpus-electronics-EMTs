Now we must evaluate the solution. The best way to do this
is to perform a check, using a different approach, and see if we
obtain the same solution. Let us try connecting a 
resistor in
series with a 10-V voltage source across the output terminals of
the original circuit and then the Thevenin equivalent. To make
the circuit easier to solve, we can take and change the parallel
current source and 
resistor to a series voltage source and
4-‚çÄ
load, gives us the circuit shown in Fig. 4.35(c).
