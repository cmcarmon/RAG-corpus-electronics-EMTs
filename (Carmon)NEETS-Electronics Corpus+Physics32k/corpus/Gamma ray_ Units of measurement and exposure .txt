The measure of the ionizing effect of gamma rays is called the exposure:
The coulomb per kilogram (C/kg) is the SI unit of ionizing radiation exposure, and is the amount of radiation required to create 1 coulomb of charge of each polarity in 1 kilogram of matter.
The röntgen (R) is an obsolete traditional unit of exposure, which represented the amount of radiation required to create 1 esu of charge of each polarity in 1 cubic centimeter of dry air. 1 röntgen= 2.58×10−4 C/kg
However, the effect of gamma and other ionizing radiation on living tissue is more closely related to the amount of energy deposited rather than the charge. This is called the absorbed dose:
The gray (Gy), which has units of joules per kilogram (J/kg), is the SI unit of absorbed dose, and is the amount of radiation required to deposit 1 joule of energy in 1 kilogram of any kind of matter.
The rad is the deprecated CGS unit, numerically equal to 0.01 J deposited per kilogram of matter; thus, 100 rad= 1 Gy.
The equivalent dose is the measure of the biological effect of radiation on human tissue. For gamma rays, it is equal to the absorbed dose.
The sievert (Sv) is the SI unit of equivalent dose, which for gamma rays is numerically equal to the absorbed dose in grays (Gy).
The rem is the deprecated CGS unit of equivalent dose. For gamma rays, an equivalent dose in rems is numerically equal to the absorbed dose in rads, or 0.01 J of energy absorbed per kilogram of matter; thus, 1 Sv= 100 rem.
