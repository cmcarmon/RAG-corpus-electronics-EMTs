In mathematics and physics, the plate trick, also known as Dirac's string trick, the belt trick, Balinese cup trick, is any of several demonstrations of the mathematical theorem that SU(2) (which double-covers SO(3)) is simply connected. To say that SU(2) double-covers SO(3) essentially means that the unit quaternions represent the group of rotations twice over. In simple terms, rotating an object with strings attached by 360 degrees does not return the system to its original state, while a second rotation of 360 degrees, a total rotation of 720 degrees, does.
