For shallow water waves, like for instance tidal waves and the hydraulic jump, the characteristic velocity v is the average flow velocity, averaged over the cross-section perpendicular to the flow direction. The wave velocity, c, is equal to the square root of gravitational acceleration g, times cross-sectional area A, divided by free-surface width B:




c
=


g


A
B




,


{\displaystyle c={\sqrt {g{\frac {A}{B}}}},}

so the Froude number in shallow water is:





F
r

=


U

g



A
B






.


{\displaystyle \mathrm {Fr} ={\frac {U}{\sqrt {g{\dfrac {A}{B}}}}}.}

For rectangular cross-sections with uniform depth d, the Froude number can be simplified to:





F
r

=


U

g
d



.


{\displaystyle \mathrm {Fr} ={\frac {U}{\sqrt {gd}}}.}

For Fr < 1 the flow is called a subcritical flow, further for Fr > 1 the flow is characterised as supercritical flow. When Fr â‰ˆ 1 the flow is denoted as critical flow.
