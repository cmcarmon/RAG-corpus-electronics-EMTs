The output of the RF amplifier stage is applied 
to  the  mixer  stage.  This  stage  combines  the  RF 
signal  with  the  signal  derived  from  the  local 
oscillator stage in order to produce a signal at the 
intermediate  frequency  (IF).  It  is  worth  noting 
that  the  output  signal  produced  by  the  mixer 
actually  contains  a  number  of  signal  components, 
including the sum and difference of the signal and 
local  oscillator  frequencies  as  well  as  the  original 
signals  plus  harmonic  components.  The  wanted 
signal  (i.e.  that  which  corresponds  to  the  IF)  is 
passed  (usually  by  some  form  of  filter)  to  the  IF 
amplifier  stage.  This  stage  provides  amplification 
as well as a high degree of selectivity.
