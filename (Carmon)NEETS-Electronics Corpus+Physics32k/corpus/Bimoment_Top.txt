Bimoment (aka warping moment) is a term used in the analysis of beams (continuum mechanics), which relates to torsion and warping. Its symbol is MÏ‰. Bimoment show the distributions at a cross-section of (longitudinal) warping stress, for the cases of torsional warping and distortional warping respectively. Generally, a bimoment can be represented by a pair of equal and opposite bending moments.
