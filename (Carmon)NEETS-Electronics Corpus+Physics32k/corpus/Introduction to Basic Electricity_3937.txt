The  most  common  use  of  video  amplifiers  is 
in  television  receivers  and  computer  monitors. 
 (FigureÂ  38-15). Transistor Q1 is connected as an 
 emitter-follower. Input to transistor Q1 is from the 
video detector. The video detector recovers the video 
signal from the intermediate frequency. In the collec-
tor circuit of transistor Q2 is a shunt-peaking coil (L1). 
In the signal-output path is a series-peaking coil (L2). 
The video signal is then coupled to the picture tube 
through coupling capacitor C4.
