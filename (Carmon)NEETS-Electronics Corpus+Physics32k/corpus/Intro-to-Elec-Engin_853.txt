The transmission-system efﬁciency is deﬁned as the ratio of the real power delivered to the
receiving-end bus to the real power transferred from the sending-end bus. This efﬁciency, which
is a measure of the real-power loss in the transmission line, comes out as 94.7% without power
factor correction, and 96.5% with power factor correction.
