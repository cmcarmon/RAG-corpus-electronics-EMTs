the magnitude and phase of the response at the resonant frequency.
(cid:1) The quality factor Q, the resonant frequency ωo, and the damping factor α
are three key parameters that characterize the behavior of resonant systems.
These three parameters can be determined by inspection by writing the
resonant system function in standard form, such that a quadratic expression
of the form s2+2αs+ω2
o is identifiable. The parameters α and ωo are directly
identified from the quadratic term, while Q is obtained from:
