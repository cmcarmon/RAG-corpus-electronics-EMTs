frequency, and phase modulation have been used in community antenna television (CATV) systems to support
multichannel LANs. Coherent lightwave systems, although still largely experimental, are expected to increase
in importance because they permit multiplexing a large number of channels over a single-mode optical Ô¨Åber.
Also of increasing importance is atmospheric propagation of electromagnetic signals. The growing demand for
mobile communication and ubiquitous computing is driving the development of the personal communication
network, which is to be based on code-division multiple access.
