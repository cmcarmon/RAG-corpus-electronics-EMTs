Just for fun, let’s see what 14 gauge wire would have done to our power circuit’s perfor-
mance. Looking at our wire size table, we ﬁnd that 14 gauge wire has a cross-sectional area of
4,107 circular mils. If we’re still using copper as a wire material (a good choice, unless we’re
really rich and can afford 4600 feet of 14 gauge silver wire!), then our speciﬁc resistance will
still be 10.09 Ω-cmil/ft:
