In the United States, electric utilities grew ﬁrst as isolated systems. Gradually, however, neigh-
boring utilities began to interconnect, which allowed utility companies to draw upon each others’
generation reserves during time of need and to schedule power transfers that take advantage
of energy-cost differences. Although overall system reliability and economy have improved
dramatically through interconnection, there is a remote possibility that an initial disturbance
may lead to instability and a regional blackout.
