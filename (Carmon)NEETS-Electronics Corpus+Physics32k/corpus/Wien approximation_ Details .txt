Wien derived his law from thermodynamic arguments, several years before Planck introduced the quantization of radiation. Details are contained in a 2009 paper by J.Crepeau entitled "A Brief History of the T4 Radiation Law". The law may be written as

{\displaystyle I(\nu ,T)={\frac {2h\nu ^{3}}{c^{2}}}e^{-{\frac {h\nu }{kT}}}}

where




I
(
ν
,
T
)


{\displaystyle I(\nu ,T)}
is the amount of energy per unit surface area per unit time per unit solid angle per unit frequency emitted at a frequency ν.




T


{\displaystyle T}
is the temperature of the black body.




h


{\displaystyle h}
is Planck's constant.




c


{\displaystyle c}
is the speed of light.




k


{\displaystyle k}
is Boltzmann's constant.

This equation may also be written as

where

{\displaystyle I(\lambda ,T)}
is the amount of energy per unit surface area per unit time per unit solid angle per unit wavelength emitted at a wavelength λ.
The peak value of this curve, as determined by taking the derivative and solving for zero, occurs at a wavelength λmax and frequency νmax of:
