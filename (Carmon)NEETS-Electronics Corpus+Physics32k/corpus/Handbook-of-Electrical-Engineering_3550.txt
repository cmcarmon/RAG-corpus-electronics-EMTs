Analog Simulation
Analog  simulation  involves  time-domain  analyses  and  frequency-domain  analyses,  which  are  generally  con-
ducted using some form of direct current (DC) simulation, diagrammed in Fig. 34.15. DC simulation deter-
  currents,
mines  the  quiescent  or  steady-state  operating  point  for  a  circuit,  specifying 
input/output resistances, element sensitivities, and input/output gains [Chua and Lin, 1975; Nagel, 1975].
