For the first definition,




H
=



f

N
c



+
f


{\displaystyle H={\frac {f^{2}}{Nc}}+f}

where




H


{\displaystyle H}
is hyperfocal distance




f


{\displaystyle f}
is focal length




N


{\displaystyle N}
is f-number (



f

/

D


{\displaystyle f/D}
for aperture diameter



D


{\displaystyle D}
)




c


{\displaystyle c}
is the circle of confusion limit
For any practical f-number, the added focal length is insignificant in comparison with the first term, so that




H

f

N
c





{\displaystyle H\approx {\frac {f^{2}}{Nc}}}

This formula is exact for the second definition, if



H


{\displaystyle H}
is measured from a thin lens, or from the front principal plane of a complex lens; it is also exact for the first definition if



H


{\displaystyle H}
is measured from a point that is one focal length in front of the front principal plane. For practical purposes, there is little difference between the first and second definitions.
