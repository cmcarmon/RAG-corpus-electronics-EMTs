If an irrotational flow occupies a simply-connected fluid region then there exists a scalar field



ϕ


{\displaystyle \phi }
such that





u

=
∇

ϕ

.


{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} =\nabla \mathbf {\phi } .}

The scalar field



ϕ


{\displaystyle \phi }
is called the velocity potential for the flow. (See Irrotational vector field.)
