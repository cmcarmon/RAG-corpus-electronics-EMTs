CENTRIFUGAL TACHOMETER.â€”A centrifugal-type tachometer is illustrated in figure 2-5,
view A. View B shows the internal arrangement of the centrifugal tachometer; refer to view B in this
discussion. In the centrifugal tachometer, centrifugal force acts upon fly weights that are connected by
links to upper and lower collars. The upper collar is affixed to a drive shaft; the lower collar is free to
move up and down the shaft. A spring, which fits over the shaft, connects the upper and lower collars.
