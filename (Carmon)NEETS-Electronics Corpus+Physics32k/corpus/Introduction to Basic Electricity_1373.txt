When there is an excess of electrons (negative charge) 
at one end of a conductor and a deficiency of  electrons 
(positive charge) at the opposite end, a current flows 
between the two ends as long as this condition  persists. 
The source that creates this excess of electrons at one 
end and the deficiency at the other end represents 
the potential, or the ability of the source to perform 
 electrical work.
