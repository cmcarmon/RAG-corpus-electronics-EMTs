While these circuits may appear to be different, the two drawings actually represent the same circuit.
The drawing in figure 3-56(B) is the familiar box-like structure and may be easier to work with. Figure
3-57(A) is a schematic of a circuit shown in a box-like structure, but may be misleading. This circuit in
reality is a series-parallel circuit that may be redrawn as shown in figure 3-57(B). The drawing in part (B)
of the figure is a simpler representation of the original circuit and could be reduced to just two resistors in
parallel.
