High-voltage transmission lines are an excellent example of how inaccessible an object of measurement may
be.  These  lines  vibrate  in  the  wind,  and  the  stresses  and  strains  require  measurement  under  the  dynamic
conditions  that  contribute  to  fatigue  failure.  Strain  tests  to  determine  fatigue  will  show  quickly  whether  the
endurance limit of the line has been exceeded, and only if it is exceeded need we be concerned about fatigue
