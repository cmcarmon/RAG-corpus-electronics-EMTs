When  working  with  sinusoidal  signals,  the  mathematical  manipulations  often 
involves computing the effects of the circuit on the amplitude and phase of the signal, 
which can involve cumbersome trigonometric identities. Operations involving sinusoidal 
functions  can  be  greatly  simplified  using  the  mathematical  construct  of  the  complex 
domain  (see  Appendix  for  more  information).  The  sinusoidal  signal  from  the  above 
equation, when expressed in the complex domain, becomes the complex exponential,
