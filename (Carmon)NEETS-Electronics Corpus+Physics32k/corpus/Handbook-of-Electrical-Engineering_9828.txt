structure and repetition of the analysis process to determine equalizer parameter values to best meet speciﬁcations.
If speciﬁcations still cannot be met, we will usually next modify generic ﬁxed components used in the system.
This iterative design and analysis process is again repeated. If no reasonable ﬁxed components can be obtained
to meet speciﬁcations, then structural changes in the proposed system are next contemplated. If no structure
can be found that allows satisfaction of speciﬁcations, either the client must be requested to relax the frequency
response  speciﬁcations  or  the  project  may  be  rejected  as  infeasible  using  present  technology.  As  we  might
suspect, economics will play a dominant role in this design process. Changes made due to iteration in the inner
loops of Fig. 100.9 normally involve little additional costs, whereas those made due to iterations in the outer
loops will often involve major cost changes.
