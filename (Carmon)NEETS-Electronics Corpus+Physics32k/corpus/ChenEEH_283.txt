Both MOSFET channel thermal noise source conÔ¨Ågurations
are shown in Figure 2.4. It should be noted that the input noise
voltage representation is valid only at low frequencies. As the
frequency rises, the admittance of gate parasitic capacitances
(CGD and CGS) becomes higher; v2
n, eq is dropped partly on the
gate impedance and partly on the output resistance of the
