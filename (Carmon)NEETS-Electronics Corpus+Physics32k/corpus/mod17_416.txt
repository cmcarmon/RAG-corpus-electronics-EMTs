The normal voice speaking range is from 100 to 3,500 hertz. During single channel AM voice 
communications, the audio frequency amplitude modulates a single rf (carrier frequency). However, in 
voice fdm, each voice frequency modulates a separate frequency lower than the carrier frequency 
(subcarrier frequency). If these subcarrier frequencies are separated by 3,500 hertz or more, they may be 
combined in a composite signal. This signal modulates the carrier frequency without causing excessive 
interference.
