can be constructed from ferromagnetic or other materials that
are nonlinear with magnetization curves containing hysteresis,
as shown in Figure 1.6. If the material has been properly
magnetized, then a remanent B ﬁeld Br exists in the material
even when H ¼ 0. Consequently, this material acts as a per-
manent magnet.
