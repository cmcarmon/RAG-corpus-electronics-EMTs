This push button, when activated, will automatically select the bandwidth for
FREQ SPAN/DIV, TIME/DIV, and VIDEO FILTER. The internal microcomputer
selects the bandwidth to maintain a calibrated display. This can be checked by
changing the FREQ SPAN/DIV and observing the bandwidth change on the
display.
