Note  that  the  individual  band  conductivities  do  not  enter  in  Eq.  (52.16).  Eq.  (52.16)  is  valid  provided  the
cyclotron orbits of the electrons are closed for the particular direction of B used. It is not necessary that the
bands be spherical or the t’s isotropic. Also, for more than two bands RH depends only on the net difference
between the number of electrons and the number of holes. For the case where ne = nh , in general, the lowest
order dependence of the Hall electric ﬁeld on B is B2 and there is no simple relationship of RH to the number
of current carriers. For the special case of the two-band model, however, RH is a constant and is of the same
form as Eq. (52.15) [Fawcett, 1964].
