While the above systems of units are based on arbitrary unit values, formalised as standards, some unit values occur naturally in science. Systems of units based on these are called natural units. Similar to natural units, atomic units (au) are a convenient system of units of measurement used in atomic physics.
Also a great number of unusual and non-standard units may be encountered. These may include the solar mass (2Ã—1030 kg), the megaton (the energy released by detonating one million tons of trinitrotoluene, TNT) and the electronvolt.
