Seeing as how a common meter movement can be made to function as a voltmeter, ammeter, or
ohmmeter simply by connecting it to different external resistor networks, it should make sense
that a multi-purpose meter (”multimeter”) could be designed in one unit with the appropriate
switch(es) and resistors.
