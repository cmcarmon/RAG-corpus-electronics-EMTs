It could well be that computing the sum is easier than integrating the signal’s square. Furthermore,
the contribution of each term in the Fourier series toward representing the signal can be measured by its
contribution to the signal’s average power. Thus, the power contained in a signal at its kth harmonic is
or |ck|2. The power spectrum, Ps (k), such as shown in Figure 4.4, plots each harmonic’s
