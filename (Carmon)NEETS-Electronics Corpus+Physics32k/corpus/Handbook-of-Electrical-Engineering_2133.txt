 and its extensions — time-lagged
It is clear that 
networks  (TLN)  and  back-propagation  through  time  (BPTT),  respectively  —  hold  a  prominent  position  in
ANN technology. It is therefore only natural to spend most of our overview presenting the theory and tools of
 (and its extension, the Oja rule)
back-propagation learning. It is also important to notice that 
  method
is  also  a  very  useful  (and  biologically  plausible)  learning  mechanism.  It  is  an 
since there is no need to specify the desired or target response to the ANN.
