Because the frequency of the rotor voltages and currents is the slip frequency, the magnitude
of the voltage induced in the rotor circuit is proportional to the slip. Also, in terms of the standstill
per-phase rotor-leakage reactance Xl2, the leakage reactance at a slip S is given by SXl2. With R2
as the per-phase resistance of the rotor, the slip-frequency equivalent circuit for a rotor phase is
shown in Figure 13.2.2, in which E2 is the per-phase voltage induced in the rotor at standstill. The
rotor current I2 is given by
