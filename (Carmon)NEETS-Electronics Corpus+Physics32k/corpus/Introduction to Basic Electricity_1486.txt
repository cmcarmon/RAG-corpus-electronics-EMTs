Light energy can be converted directly to elec-
trical  energy  by  light  striking  a   photosensitive 
( light- sensitive) substance in a photovoltaic	cell	
(solar	cell) (Figure 12-6). A solar cell consists of 
photosensitive materials mounted between metal 
contacts. When the surface of the photosensitive 
 material is exposed to light, it dislodges electrons 
from their orbits around the surface atoms of the 
 material. This occurs because light has energy. A 
single cell can produce a small voltage. Figure 12-7 
shows the schematic symbol for a solar cell. Many 
cells must be linked together to produce a usable volt-
age and current. Solar cells are used primarily in sat-
ellites and cameras. The high cost of construction has 
limited their general application. However, the price 
of solar cells is coming down.
