In Taiwan, the Taiwanese ping remains in fairly common use and is about 3.306 m2. In mainland China, the metrification of traditional units would produce a ping of 4 m2, but it is almost unknown with most real estate floorspace simply reckoned in square meters. The longer length of the Hong Kong foot produces a larger ping of almost 5 m2, but it is similarly uncommon.
