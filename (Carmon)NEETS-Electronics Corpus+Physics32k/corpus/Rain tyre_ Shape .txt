Sometimes rain tyres are designed to have a smaller diameter than their dry counterparts. This means that the wheel spins faster and more water is thrown off the tyre by overcoming centripetal force. Some rain tyres are also narrower than the dry counterparts. This smaller "footprint" reduces the chances of hydroplaning.
