Thin-ﬁlm  media  can  also  be  made  extremely  smooth.  To  achieve  the  smallest  possible  head-to-medium
spacing and therefore the sharpest head ﬁeld gradient and the least spacing loss, smooth media are required.
The coercivity of thin-ﬁlm media can also be made very high. In volume production today are media with
coercivities of 160 kA/m; however, media with coercivities to 250 kA/m have been made and appear promising
[Velu and Lambeth, 1992]. Such high coercivities are adequate to achieve more than an order of magnitude
higher recording density than today.
