active device(s) must be operated in the linear part 
their  transfer  characteristic  (Vout  plotted 
of 
against Vin). In Fig. 7.3 the input and output signals 
for an amplifier are operating in linear mode. This 
form of operation is known as Class A and the bias 
point is adjusted to the mid-point of the linear part 
of  the  transfer  characteristic.  Furthermore,  current 
will  flow  in  the  active  devices  used  in  a  Class  A 
amplifier  during  a  complete  cycle  of  the  signal 
waveform. At no time does the current fall to zero.
