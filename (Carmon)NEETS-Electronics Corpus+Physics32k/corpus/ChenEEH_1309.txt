PS/2 Port
A type of port developed by IBM for connecting a mouse or
keyboard to a PC is the PS/2 port. This port supports a mini-
DIN plug containing just six pins. Most PCs have a PS/2 port
so that the serial port can be used by another device, such as a
modem. The PS/2 port is often called the mouse port. Most
laptops have one PS/2 port that is used to hook up a full-sized
mouse or keyboard to a laptop. To hook up both a mouse and
a keyboard, a PS/2 keyboard and a serial-type mouse are
required. The mouse will interface through the laptopâ€™s stand-
ard serial port.
