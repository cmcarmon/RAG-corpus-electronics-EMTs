Ethics programs are offered by employers and are 
intended to affect how people think about and  address 
ethical issues that arise on the job. An employerâ€™s 
 established ethical guidelines benefit the company by 
steering employees away from any ethical risk-taking 
situations to a more appropriate and productive type 
of action. An ethics program allows employees to be 
sensitive to ethical issues on the job.
