For the estimation of the Si and the STi for all input variables, N(d+2) model runs are required. Since N is often of the order of hundreds or thousands of runs, computational expense can quickly become a problem when the model takes a significant amount of time for a single run. In such cases, there are a number of techniques available to reduce the computational cost of estimating sensitivity indices, such as emulators, HDMR and FAST.
