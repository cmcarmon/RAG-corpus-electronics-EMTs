In general relativity, a gravitational wave is a space-time perturbation which propagates at the speed of light. It then curves slightly the space-time, which changes locally the light path. Mathematically speaking, if



h


{\displaystyle h}
is the amplitude (assumed to be small) of the incoming gravitational wave and



L


{\displaystyle L}
the length of the optical cavity in which the light is in circulation, the change



δ
L


{\displaystyle \delta L}
of the optical path due to the gravitational wave is given by the formula:







δ
L

L


=
C
×
h


{\displaystyle {\frac {\delta L}{L}}=C\times h}

with



C
≤
1


{\displaystyle C\leq 1}
being a geometrical factor which depends on the relative orientation between the cavity and the direction of propagation of the incoming gravitational wave.
