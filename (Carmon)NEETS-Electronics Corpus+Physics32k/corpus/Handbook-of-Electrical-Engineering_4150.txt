Lightning ﬂash density is deﬁned as the number of lightning ﬂashes per unit time per unit area and is usually
measured in units of lightning ﬂashes, either cloud or cloud-to-ground or both, per square kilometer per year.
The two most common techniques for directly measuring ﬂash density are (1) the use of so-called ﬂash counters,
relatively  crude  devices  which  trigger  on  electric  ﬁelds  above  a  value  of  the  order  of  1  kV/m  in  a  frequency
band centered in the hundreds of hertz to kilohertz range, of which two models are extensively used, the CIGRE
