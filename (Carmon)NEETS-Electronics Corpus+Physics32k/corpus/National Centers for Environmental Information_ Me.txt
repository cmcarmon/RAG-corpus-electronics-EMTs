The establishment of NCEI was rooted in the dramatic increase in the demand for environmental data and information in the years preceding 2015. In order to meet the demand, the three existing data centers are merged in accordance with the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, Public Law 113-235:
National Climatic Data Center (NCDC)
National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC)
National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC), which includes the National Coastal Data Development Center (NCDDC)
NCEI was launched on April 22, 2015. The transition is expected to finish beyond 2020, while at the meantime none of the existing products and services will be affected by the merger. Existing URLs, links and domain names for the data centers will remain accessible, even though a plan will be developed to consolidate the domains, also any change will be advertised and appropriate redirects will be created.
