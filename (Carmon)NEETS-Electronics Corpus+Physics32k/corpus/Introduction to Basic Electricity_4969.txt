Before the arrival of surface mount  technology 
(smt), there were two designated layers for through-
hole printed circuit boards: the component side 
and the solder side. With the implementation of 
SMT, components are now placed on both sides of the 
printed circuit board, which are referred to as top and 
bottom. Both conventional through-hole and SMT 
layouts are viewed from the component side, or top. 
This makes the bottom layer similar to an X-ray view 
through the insulating base material, which can be 
very confusing (Figure 48-6).
