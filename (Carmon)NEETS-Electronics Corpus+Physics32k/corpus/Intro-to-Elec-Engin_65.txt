The concept of an ideal current source, although less familiar but useful as we shall see later,
is deﬁned as one whose current i is a speciﬁed function of time, regardless of the voltage across its
terminals. The circuit symbols and the corresponding i–v curves for the ideal voltage and current
sources are shown in Figure 1.1.6.
