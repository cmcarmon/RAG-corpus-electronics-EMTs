Used by the Rykers from Planet Unadar, a world of metal and pollution.
Yellow in color, the Ryker players can shape it into a physical form for some highly intense physical attacks. For example:
When Tia jumped up to intercept the ball, in the Snow Kids' first match against the Rykers, two opposing players jumped in front of her and knocked her out of the air with two powerful blasts of Metal Yell before knocking her over once again with their weight.
The Ryker's goalkeeper, later, hit the ball with a blast of Metal Yell, and made it slow down to a gradual stop in the palm of her hand.

It's called Metal Yell due to the fact that whenever the Rykers use it they always scream in their eerie metallic voice. This can also distract their opponents' attention.
