pole alternator. In fact, such an alternator may be run as an ac motor. It is similar to the drawing in figure
4-6. Synchronous motors have the characteristic of constant speed between no load and full load. They
are capable of correcting the low power factor of an inductive load when they are operated under certain
conditions. They are often used to drive dc generators. Synchronous motors are designed in sizes up to
thousands of horsepower. They may be designed as either single-phase or multiphase machines. The
discussion that follows is based on a three-phase design.
