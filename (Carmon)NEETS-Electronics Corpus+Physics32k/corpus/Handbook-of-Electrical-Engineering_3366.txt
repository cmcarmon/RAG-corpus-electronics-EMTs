and is graphically depicted in Fig. 31.22. In the other type of switch, the Db directional coupler, the electrodes
are placed directly over the directional coupler as shown in Fig. 31.23. The applied electric Ô¨Åeld alters the power
transfer  between  the  two  adjacent  waveguides.  Research  versions  of  this  switch  have  demonstrated  contrast
ratios greater than 40 dB (10,000:1); however, commercial versions typically achieve 20 dB, which is competitive
