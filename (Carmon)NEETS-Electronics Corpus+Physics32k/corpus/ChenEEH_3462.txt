Synchronous generators are commonly used in high-voltage
power systems to generate electric power. They are also pro-
tected using the current differential relaying principle. In ad-
dition, the generators require a number of other special
operating conditions to be met. This leads to the use of a score
of other relaying principles. This section reviews some basic
requirements for generator protection and discusses the basic
relaying principles used. A much more comprehensive coverage
of the subject may be found in an IEEE Tutorial (1995).
