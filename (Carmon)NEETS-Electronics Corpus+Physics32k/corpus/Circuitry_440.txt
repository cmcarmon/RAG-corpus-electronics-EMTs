A simple  phase-shift  oscillator  based  on  a  three- 
stage  C–R ladder  network  is  shown  in  Fig.  9.2. 
TR1  operates  as  a  conventional  common-emitter 
amplifier stage with R1 and R2 providing base bias 
potential  and  R3 and  C1 providing  emitter 
stabilization.  
  The total phase shift provided by the C–R ladder 
network (connected between collector and base) is 
180° at the frequency of oscillation. The transistor 
provides  the  other  180°  phase  shift  in  order  to 
realize  an  overall  phase  shift  of  360°  or  0°  (note 
that these are the same). 
  The frequency of oscillation of the circuit shown 
in Fig. 9.2 is given by:
