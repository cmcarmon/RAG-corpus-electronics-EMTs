Before detailed analysis takes place, ground rules and assumptions are usually defined and agreed to. This might include, for example:
Standardized mission profile with specific fixed duration mission phases
Sources for failure rate and failure mode data
Fault detection coverage that system built-in test will realize
Whether the analysis will be functional or piece part
Criteria to be considered (mission abort, safety, maintenance, etc.)
System for uniquely identifying parts or functions
Severity category definitions
