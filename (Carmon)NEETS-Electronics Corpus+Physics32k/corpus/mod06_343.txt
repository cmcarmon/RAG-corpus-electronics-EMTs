An operating gas-filled tube has molecules, ions, and free electrons present within the envelope. In a
gas-filled diode, the electron stream from the hot cathode encounters gas molecules on its way to the
plate. When an electron collides with a gas molecule, the energy transmitted by the collision may cause
the molecule to release an electron. This second electron then may join the original stream of electrons
and is capable of freeing other electrons. This process, which is cumulative, is a form of ionization. The
free electrons, greatly increased in quantity by ionization, continue to the plate of the diode. The molecule
which has lost an electron is called an ion and bears a positive charge. The positive ions drift toward the
negative cathode and during their journey attract additional electrons from the cathode.
