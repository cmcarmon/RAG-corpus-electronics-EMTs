For most hobby electronics projects, 1/4 W or 1/8 W resistors are fine. You 
need high‐wattage resistors for high‐load applications, where loads, such as a 
motor or a lamp control, require higher‐than‐hobby‐level currents to operate. 
High‐wattage resistors take many forms, but you can bet they are bigger and 
bulkier than your average resistor. Resistors with power ratings over 5 W are 
wrapped in epoxy (or another waterproof and flameproof coating) and have a 
rectangular, rather than cylindrical, shape. A high‐wattage resistor may even 
include its own metal heat sink, with fins that conduct heat away from the 
resistor.
