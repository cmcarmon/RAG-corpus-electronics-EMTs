In order to use the tabulated transform pairs of Table 3.3.1, algebraic manipulations will
become necessary to make F(s) correspond to one of the tabulated entries. While the process may
be simple in some cases, in other cases F(s) may have to be rearranged in a systematic way as
a sum of component functions whose inverse transforms are tabulated. A formalized approach
to resolve F(s) into a summation of simple factors is known as the method of partial-fraction
expansion (Heaviside expansion theorem).
