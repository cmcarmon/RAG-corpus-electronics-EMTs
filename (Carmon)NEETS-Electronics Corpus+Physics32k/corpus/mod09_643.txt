At the first instant of time, a pulse of 100-volts amplitude with a duration of 100 microseconds is 
applied. Since the capacitor cannot respond instantaneously to a change in voltage, all of the applied 
voltage is felt across the resistor. As time progresses, the capacitor will charge and the voltage across the 
resistor will be reduced. Since the time that the capacitor is permitted to charge is 100 microseconds, the 
capacitor will charge for only 1/10 of 1TC or to 9.5 percent of the applied voltage. The voltage across the 
resistor must be equal to the difference between the applied voltage and the charge on the capacitor (100 
âˆ’ 9.5 volts), or 90.5 volts.
