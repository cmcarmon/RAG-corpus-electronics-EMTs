Peripheral Component Interconnect Local Bus
The peripheral component interconnect (PCI) local bus is
the newest bus standard accepted by all computer systems such
as PC-based systems, Appleâ€™s Power Macintosh computers and
Workgroup servers, Sun workstations, and PowerPC proces-

speed of VLB with the advanced arbitration of EISA. Great for
both video cards and bus mastering SCSI/network cards. Some
of its features include these:
