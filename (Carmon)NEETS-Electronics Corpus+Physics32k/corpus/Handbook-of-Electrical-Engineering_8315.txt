Clock Control Requirements. Another very important requirement for implementing DFT is the ability to
control the clocking of the internal logic of the digital circuit. If the external clock signal is gated with some
other signals such that it is necessary to determine how to set these other signals to their required values to
allow the externally applied clock pulse to reach the internal ﬂip-ﬂop clock terminals, then the ATPG program
has another level of constraints to resolve in generating the test patterns. Furthermore, some of these additional
requirements  may  pose  difﬁculties  in  satisfying  them  during  component  and/or  system  testing.  Most ATPG
programs assume that once the test pattern has been applied to the pins of the component, the system’s response
to  that  pattern  can  be  captured  by  applying  an  external  clock  pulse  which  enables  the  internal  ﬂip-ﬂops  to
