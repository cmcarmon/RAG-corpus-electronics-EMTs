A common example of longitudinal modes are the light wavelengths produced by a laser. In the simplest case, the laser's optical cavity is formed by two opposed plane (flat) mirrors surrounding the gain medium (a plane-parallel or Fabry–Pérot cavity). The allowed modes of the cavity are those where the mirror separation distance L is equal to an exact multiple of half the wavelength, λ:




L

q


λ

{\displaystyle L=q{\frac {\lambda }{2}}}

where q is an integer known as the mode order.
In practice, the separation distance of the mirrors L is usually much greater than the wavelength of light λ, so the relevant values of q are large (around 105 to 106). The frequency separation between any two adjacent modes, q and q+1, in a material that is transparent at the laser wavelength, are given (for an empty linear resonator of length L) by Δν:

{\displaystyle \Delta \nu ={\frac {c}{2nL}}}

where c is the speed of light and n is the refractive index of the material (note: n≈1 in air).
