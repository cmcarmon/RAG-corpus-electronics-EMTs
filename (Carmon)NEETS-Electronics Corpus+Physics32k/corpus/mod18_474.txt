Many radar systems contain circuits that serve special functions. Three of these special circuits are 
instantaneous automatic gain control (iagc), sensitivity time control (stc), and fast time constant (ftc). 
These circuits may be found in combination or alone, depending on the purpose of the radar. When the 
test methods and procedures about to be described are used, these special functions should not be used. If 
an automatic frequency control (afc) circuit is included in the radar, it may be permitted to operate during 
receiver tests. A good way you can check afc circuit operation is to complete the tests specified for 
manual tuning and then switch to afc. If the afc circuit operation is normal, test indications should not 
differ.
