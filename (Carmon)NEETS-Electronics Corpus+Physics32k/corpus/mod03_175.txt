The shunt ohmmeter is connected to the circuit to be measured in the same way the series ohmmeter
is connected. The only difference is that on the shunt ohmmeter the Â¥  reading is adjusted, while on the
series ohmmeter the 0 reading is adjusted. Shunt ohmmeters are not commonly used because they are
limited generally to measuring resistances from 5 ohms to 400 ohms. If you use a shunt ohmmeter, be
certain to switch it to the OFF position when you are finished using it.
