 
The real part and imaginary part of impedance are interpreted as a resistive part 
that dissipates energy and a reactive part that stores energy. Resistors can only dissipate 
energy and therefore their impedances have only a real part. Capacitors and inductors can 
only  store  energy  and  therefore  their  impedances  have  only  an  imaginary  part.  When 
resistors, capacitors, and inductors are combined, the overall impedance may have both 
real and imaginary parts. It is important to note that the definition of impedance preserves 
the definition of resistance. Therefore, for a circuit with only resistors, ZEQ = REQ.
