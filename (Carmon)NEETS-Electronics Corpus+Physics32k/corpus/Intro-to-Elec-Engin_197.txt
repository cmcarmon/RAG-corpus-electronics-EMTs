Figure 2.6.1 illustrates MATLAB’s main features. The built-in functions with their state-of-
the-art algorithms provide excellent tools for linear algebra computations, data analysis, signal
processing, optimization, numerical solution of ordinary differential equations (ODE), numerical
integration (Quadrature), and many other types of scientiﬁc and engineering computations.
Numerous functions are also available for 2D and 3D graphics as well as for animation. Users can
also write their own functions, which then behave just like the built-in functions. MATLAB even
provides an external interface to run Fortran and C programs. Optional “toolboxes,” which are
collections of specialized functions for particular applications, are also available. For example,
