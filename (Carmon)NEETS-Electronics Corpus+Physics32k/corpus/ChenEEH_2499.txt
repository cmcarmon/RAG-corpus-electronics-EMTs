In the design of a passive component, function-speciﬁc
insertion/return
parameters, such as frequency bandwidth,
input/output impedance levels, group/phase delays,
losses,
and isolation and transient response, are usually the most
important. Other parameters like temperature stability, vibra-
tion resistance, low passive intermodulation, or multipacting
effects are secondary although, depending on the application,
may have a direct inﬂuence on circuit design.
