The circuits-approach macromodel can also be easily adapted to current-feedback op amp designs, whose input
impedance at the noninverting input is much greater than that at the inverting input [see Williams, 1991]. The
interested  reader  is  referred  to  the  text  edited  by  J.  Williams,  listed  in  the  references,  as  well  as  the  SPICE
modeling book by Connelly and Choi [1992].
