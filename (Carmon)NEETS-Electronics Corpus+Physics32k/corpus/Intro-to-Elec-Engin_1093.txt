Because a synchronous machine operates only at synchronous speed under steady-state
conditions, the machine cannot operate at synchronous speed during the load transition when the
load on the synchronous machine is to be changed; the readjustment process is in fact dynamic.
In the case of a generator connected to an inﬁnite bus, an increase in the electric output power of
the generator is brought about by increasing the mechanical input power supplied by the prime
mover. The speed of the rotor increases momentarily during the process, and the axis of the rotor-
ﬁeld mmf advances relative to the axes of both the armature mmf and the resultant air-gap mmf.
The increase in torque angle results in an increase in electric power output. The machine then
locks itself into synchronism and continues to rotate at synchronous speed until the load changes
further. The same general argument can be made for the operation of a synchronous motor, except
that an increase in mechanical load decreases the speed of the rotor during the transition period,
so that the axis of the rotor-ﬁeld mmf falls behind that of the stator mmf or the resultant air-gap
mmf by the required value of the load angle.
