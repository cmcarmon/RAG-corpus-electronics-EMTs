The most important group of materials connected with electricity and electronics are the
ferromagnetic materials. Ferromagnetic materials are those which are relatively easy to magnetize, such
as iron, steel, cobalt, and the alloys Alnico and Permalloy. (An alloy is made from combining two or
more elements, one of which must be a metal). These new alloys can be very strongly magnetized, and
are capable of obtaining a magnetic strength great enough to lift 500 times their own weight.
