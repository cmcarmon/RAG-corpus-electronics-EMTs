As seen in Subsections 9.6.1 and 9.6.2, the essence of FTHNs is
the computation of updating fuzzy time stamps, and this
computation involves only additions and comparisons of real
numbers. Thus, computation can be done very fast, and
FTHNs are suitable for performance analysis in real-time ap-
plications. The notion of fuzzy timing is highly ﬂexible in that
it can capture imprecise or incomplete knowledge regarding
time behavior with speciﬁed or given possibility distributions,
as well as the more conventional deterministic and probabi-
listic knowledge. However, it is expected that the traditional
probabilistic approach and the FTHN method using possibility
theory are complementary, rather than competitive, as possi-
bility theory is considered to be complementary to probability
theory (Zadeh, 1995). We expect that the FTHN method is
more scalable than the traditional stochastic approaches be-
cause the FTHN computations are done using real arithmetic
operations.
