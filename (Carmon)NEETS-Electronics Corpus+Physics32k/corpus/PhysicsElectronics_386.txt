If light of the proper wavelength is incident on the depletion region of a diode while a reverse
voltage is applied, the absorbed photons can produce additional electron-hole pairs. Photo-
diodes or photocells can receive frequency-modulated light signals. LEDs and photodiodes
are often used in optical communication as receiver and transmitter respectively.
