The fundamental interacting force of physisorption is caused by van der Waals force. Even though the interaction energy is very weak (~10â€“100 meV), physisorption plays an important role in nature. For instance, the van der Waals attraction between surfaces and foot-hairs of geckos provides the remarkable ability to climb up vertical walls. Van der Waals forces originate from the interactions between induced, permanent or transient electric dipoles.
In comparison with chemisorption, in which the electronic structure of bonding atoms or molecules is changed and covalent or ionic bonds form, physisorption, generally speaking, can only be observed in the environment of low temperature (thermal energy at room temperature ~26 meV) and the absence of the relatively strong chemisorptions. In practice, the categorisation of a particular adsorption as physisorption or chemisorption depends principally on the binding energy of the adsorbate to the substrate.
