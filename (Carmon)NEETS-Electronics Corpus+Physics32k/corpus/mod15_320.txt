We can show precession by using the models in figure 3-7, view (A) and view (B). The gyro wheel 
is mounted so it is free to have its spin axis pointed in any direction. Here the wheel rotates in a flat loop 
called the gyro case (inner gimbal). The gyro case is pivoted in the gimbal ring (outer gimbal) and the 
gyro can swing about the Z axis. The gimbal ring itself turns on pivots that connect it to the fork 
(support). The fork permits the gyro to tilt from side to side about the Y axis.
