 4. Minimize handling of ESDS devices and assemblies. Keep replacement devices or assemblies,
with their connector-shorting bars, clips, and so forth, intact in their electrostatic-free packages
until needed. Place removed repairable ESDS devices or assemblies, with their connector shorting
bars or clips installed, in electrostatic-free packages as soon as they are removed from the
equipment. ESDS devices or assemblies should be transported and stored only in protective
packaging.
