The meter movements discussed earlier in this chapter have all reacted to current. Various ways have
been shown in which these movements can be used in ammeters. If the current and resistance are known,
the voltage can be calculated by the formula E = IR. A meter movement has a known resistance, so as the
movement reacts to the current, the voltage can be indicated on the scale of the meter.
