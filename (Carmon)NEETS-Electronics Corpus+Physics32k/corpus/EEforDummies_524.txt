A 1:1 transformer is also known as an isolation transformer, and is commonly 
used to electrically separate two circuits while allowing AC power or an AC 
signal from one to feed into the other. The first circuit typically contains 
the power source, and the second circuit contains the load. (You find out 
in ChapterÂ 1 that the load is the destination for the electrical energy, or the 
thing you ultimately want to perform work on, such as a speaker diaphragm.) 
You may want to isolate circuits to reduce the risk of electrical shocks or to 
prevent one circuit from interfering with the other.
