This setting and resetting of the FFs will continue until all the FFs are set and all the lamps are lit. At
that time the count will be 11112 or 1510. Clock pulse 16 will cause FF1 to reset and lamp A to go out.
This will cause FF2 through FF4 to reset, in order, and will extinguish lamps B, C, and D. The counter
would then start at 00012 on clock pulse 17. To display a count of 1610 or 100002, we would need to add
another FF.
