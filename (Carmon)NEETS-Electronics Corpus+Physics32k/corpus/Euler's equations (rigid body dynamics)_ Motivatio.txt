Starting from Newton's second law, in an inertial frame of reference (subscripted "in"), the time derivative of the angular momentum L equals the applied torque

{\displaystyle {\frac {d\mathbf {L} _{\text{in}}}{dt}}\ {\stackrel {\mathrm {def} }{=}}\ {\frac {d}{dt}}\left(\mathbf {I} _{\text{in}}{\boldsymbol {\omega }}\right)=\mathbf {M} _{\text{in}}}

where Iin is the moment of inertia tensor calculated in the inertial frame. Although this law is universally true, it is not always helpful in solving for the motion of a general rotating rigid body, since both Iin and ω can change during the motion.
Therefore, we change to a coordinate frame fixed in the rotating body, and chosen so that its axes are aligned with the principal axes of the moment of inertia tensor. In this frame, at least the moment of inertia tensor is constant (and diagonal), which simplifies calculations. As described in the moment of inertia, the angular momentum L can be written

In general, L = Iω is substituted and the time derivatives are taken realizing that the inertia tensor, and so also the principal moments, do not depend on time. This leads to the general vector form of Euler's equations
