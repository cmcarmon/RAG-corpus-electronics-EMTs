Figure  105.1  [McRuer  and  Krendel,  1974]  shows  a  general  quasi-linear  man-machine  system  with  time-
stationary properties. This diagram is suitable for the description of human behavior in an interactive man-
machine system wherein the human responds to visually sensed inputs and communicates with the machine
via a manipulator of some sort (e.g., control stick, wheel, pedal, etc.). This block diagram indicates the minimum
needed number of major functional signal pathways internal to the human operator to characterize different
behavioral features. The constituent human sensing, data processing, computing, and actuating elements are
connected as internal signal processing pathways which can be “reconﬁgured” as the situation changes. Such
reconﬁguration is an aspect of human behavior as a system architect. Functional operations on internal signals
within a given pathway may also be modiﬁed.
