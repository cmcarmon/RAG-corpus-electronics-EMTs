Two possible mechanism give origin to the spin Hall effect, in which an electric current (composed of moving charges) transform into a spin current (a current of moving spins without charge flow). The original (extrinsic) mechanism devised by Dyakonov and Perel consisted on spin-dependent Mott scattering, where a carriers with opposite spin are diffused in opposite directions when colliding with impurities in the material. The second mechanism is due to intrinsic properties of the material, where carriers trajectories are distorted due to spinâ€“orbit interaction as a consequence of the asymmetries in the material.
One can intuitively picture the intrinsic effect by using the classical analogy between an electron and a spinning tennis ball. The tennis ball deviates from its straight path in air in a direction depending on the sense of rotation, also known as the Magnus effect. In a solid, the air is replaced by an effective electric field due to asymmetries in the material, the relative motion between the magnetic moment (associated to the spin) and the electric field creates a coupling that distort the motion of the electrons.
Similar to the standard Hall effect, both the extrinsic and the intrinsic mechanisms, lead to an accumulation of spins of opposite signs on opposing lateral boundaries.
