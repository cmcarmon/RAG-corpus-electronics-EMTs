The value of expert system shells was quickly recognized by
the research community and industry. The number of expert
systems increased dramatically in the following years. The
estimated number of developed expert systems increased
from 50 in 1985 to 2200 in 1988 and then to 12,500 in 1992
(Durkin, 1993; Hammond, 1986). The vast majority of them
have been developed using a shell, with LISP, PROLOG, and
OPS-5 as the other major languages being used. During the
past three decades, the ﬁeld of expert systems has changed
from a technology conﬁned to research circles to one being
used commercially to aid human decision making in a wide
range of applications.
