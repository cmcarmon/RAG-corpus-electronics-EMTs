Characterization of I/O Workloads
Before characterizing the I/O behavior of different workloads, it is necessary to Ô¨Årst understand the elements
of disk performance. Disk performance is a function of the service time, which consists of three main compo-
nents: seek time, rotational latency, and data transfer time.2 Seek time is the time needed to position the heads
