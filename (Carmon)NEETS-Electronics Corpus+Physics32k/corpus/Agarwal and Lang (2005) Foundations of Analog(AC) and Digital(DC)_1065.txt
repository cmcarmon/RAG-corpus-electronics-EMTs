(cid:1) The SR model of the MOSFET characterizes the behavior of the MOSFET
as a resistor when the MOSFET is in its ON state, and vGS is fixed. The SR
model is appropriate for most types of simple analyses involving digital cir-
cuits, such as static discipline computations of voltage levels, simple power
calculations, and, as will be discussed in later chapters, delay calculations.
Although technically the SR model is valid only in the MOSFET’s triode
region (that is, when vDS < (vGS − VT)), for simplicity, we ignore this
limitation and apply it in digital circuit applications irrespective of the value
of the drain voltage, since the model is such a gross simplification of the
MOSFET’s behavior in the first place.
