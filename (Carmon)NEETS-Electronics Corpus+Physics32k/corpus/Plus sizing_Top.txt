Plus sizing is the practice of replacing an automotive wheel with one of a larger diameter fitted with a new tire of lower aspect ratio so that the new tire has the same diameter and circumference as the original tire to prevent any changes in speedometer accuracy, torque and traction control, while reducing sidewall flex and (generally) increasing cornerning ability.
The number following the "plus" describes the number of inches which is added to the diameter of the rim. For example, plus one sizing means increasing the wheel by one inch – from a 15 inch to a 16 inch, for example.
A "plus zero" upgrade means changing to a wider tire size while using the same diameter wheel.
Changing to a wider tire requires reducing the aspect ratio (the second number in the sequence of numbers that describes the tire's size). Since the aspect ratio is a percentage which is used to calculate the height of the tire's sidewall, if follows that if a larger number is used for the width, a smaller number must be substituted if the final result is to remain the same—which is the objective of Plus sizing.
