The STROBOTAC (figure 2-7) is an electronic flash device in which the flash duration is very short
(a few millionths of a second). (Table 2-1 contains a description of the controls and indicators shown on
the strobotac in figure 2-7.) Because of this short flash duration, the strobotac can measure very rapid
motion. The box contains a swivel mount with a STROBOTRON LAMP in a reflector, an electronic
pulse generator to control the flashing rate, and a power supply that operates from the ac power line. The
flashing rate is controlled by the large knob; the corresponding speed (rpm) is indicated on an illuminated
dial that is viewed through windows in the knob.
