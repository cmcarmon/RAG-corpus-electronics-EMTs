. Erasable programmable ROM (EPROM) is often used in
microcontroller applications. A good example is the basic
input output system (BIOS) used to start up the PC.
During the start-up process, the EPROM supplies the
necessary instructions to the CPU so that the computerâ€™s
subsystems can be initialized and tested. EPROMs usually
have the same organization as the SRAM. EPROMs can
be erased by being exposed to ultraviolet light for about
15 min.
