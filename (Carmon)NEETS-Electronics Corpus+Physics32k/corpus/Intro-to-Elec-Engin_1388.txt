In the VHF and UHF bands, thermal noise and cosmic noise, picked up by the antenna, become
predominant. Above 10 GHz in the SHF band, atmospheric conditions (such as precipitation and
heavy rains) play a major role in signal propagation. In the infrared and visible light regions of
the electromagnetic spectrum, LOS optical communication in free space is being experimented
with for satellite-to-satellite links.
