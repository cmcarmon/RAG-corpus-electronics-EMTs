The SHUNT-DIODE DETECTOR (figure 3-6) is similar to the series-diode detector except that the
output variations are current pulses rather than voltage pulses. Passing this current through a shunt
resistor develops the voltage output. The input is an rf modulated envelope. On the negative half cycles of
the rf, diode CR1 is forward biased and shunts the signal to ground. On the positive half cycles, current
flows from the output through L1 to the input. A field is built up around L1 that tends to keep the current
flowing. This action integrates the rf current pulses and causes the output to follow the modulation
envelope (intelligence) closely. (Integration was discussed in NEETS, Module 9, Introduction to
Wave-Generation and Wave-Shaping Circuits.) Shunt resistor R1 develops the output voltage from this
current flow. Although the shunt detector operates on the principle of current flow, it is the output voltage
across the shunt resistor that is used to reproduce the original modulation signal. The shunt-diode detector
is easily identified by noting that the detector diode is in parallel with both the input and load impedance.
The waveforms associated with this detector are identical to those shown in views (B), (C), and (D) of
figure 3-5.
