Electrostatics 
 
If  a  conductor  has  a  deficit  of  electrons,  it  will 
exhibit a net positive charge. If, on the other hand, 
it  has  a  surplus  of  electrons,  it  will  exhibit  a  net 
negative  charge.  An  imbalance  in  charge  can  be 
produced  by  friction  (removing  or  depositing 
electrons  using  materials  such  as  silk  and  fur, 
respectively) or induction (by attracting or repelling 
electrons  using  a 
second  body  which 
is, 
respectively, positively or negatively charged).
