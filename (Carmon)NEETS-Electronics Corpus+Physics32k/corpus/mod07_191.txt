A P-TYPE SEMICONDUCTOR is one which is doped with a P-TYPE or acceptor impurity (an
impurity that reduces the number of free electrons causing more holes). The holes in this type
semiconductor are the majority current carriers since they are present in the greatest quantity while the
electrons are the minority current carriers.
