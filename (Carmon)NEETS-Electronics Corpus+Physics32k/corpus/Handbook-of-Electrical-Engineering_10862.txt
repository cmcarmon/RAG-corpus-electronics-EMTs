One of the earliest standardization efforts was concerned with algorithms and there have been several attempts
to create standard CACSD libraries. One of these, SLICOT [van den Boom et al., 1991], is still ongoing. But it
has to be admitted that such efforts have had little success in the marketplace. The real break-through came
with the development of the “matrix environments”, which are discussed in the next section. Currently, although
many  research  groups  continue  to  develop  specialist  tools  and  packages  in  conventional  languages  such  as
FORTRAN, most CACSD tool-makers now use these matrix environments as a high-level language for creating
“toolboxes” of tools.
