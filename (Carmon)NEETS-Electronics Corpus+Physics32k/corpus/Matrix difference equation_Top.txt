A matrix difference equation is a difference equation in which the value of a vector (or sometimes, a matrix) of variables at one point in time is related to its own value at one or more previous points in time, using matrices. The order of the equation is the maximum time gap between any two indicated values of the variable vector. For example,





x

t


=
A

x

t
−
1


+
B

x

t
−
2




{\displaystyle x_{t}=Ax_{t-1}+Bx_{t-2}}

is an example of a second-order matrix difference equation, in which x is an n × 1 vector of variables and A and B are n×n matrices. This equation is homogeneous because there is no vector constant term added to the end of the equation. The same equation might also be written as





x

t
+
2


=
A

x

t
+
1


+
B

x

t




{\displaystyle x_{t+2}=Ax_{t+1}+Bx_{t}}

or as

The most commonly encountered matrix difference equations are first-order.
