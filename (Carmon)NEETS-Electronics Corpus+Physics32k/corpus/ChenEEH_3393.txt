Considering the system of Figure 8.2, notice the effect of a
sudden load increase in area A on the ACE in both areas A and
B. First, the frequency in both areas will decrease and, accord-
ingly, the power output for all regulated units will increase
according to their respective droop settings. Since the load
change occurs in area A, there will be an additional unsched-
uled in-ï¬‚ow from B. ACE in area A will have two negative
terms: schedule error DPTie and the frequency bias, or con-
trol, error. Conversely, ACE in area B will have a positive
schedule error but a negative frequency bias.
