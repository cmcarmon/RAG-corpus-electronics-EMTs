The maximum current for any solar cell is dependent on the bandgap of the absorbing semiconductor and
the  solar  spectrum.  Any  photon  with  an  energy  greater  than  the  bandgap  can  be  expected  to  generate  one
electron-hole pair, which will lead to one collectable minority carrier. The absorption coefÔ¨Åcient of the semi-
conductor  material  determines  the  thickness  required  to  absorb  the  sunlight  with  energies  greater  than  the
bandgap. As examples, a silicon thickness of 0.5 mm will absorb 93% of the sunlight with an energy above its
