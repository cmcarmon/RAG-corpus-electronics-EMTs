Figure 4.5: The Fourier series spectrum of a half-wave rectiﬁed sinusoid is shown in the upper portion.
The index indicates the multiple of the fundamental frequency at which the signal has energy. The
cumulative eﬀect of adding terms to the Fourier series for the half-wave rectiﬁed sine wave is shown in
the bottom portion. The dashed line is the actual signal, with the solid line showing the ﬁnite series
approximation to the indicated number of terms, K + 1.
