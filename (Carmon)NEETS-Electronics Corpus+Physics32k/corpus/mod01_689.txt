Frayed and damaged cords or plugs; receptacles, plugs, and cords which feel warm to the touch; slight
shocks felt when handling electrical equipment; unusually hot running electric motors and other electrical
equipment; an odor of burning or overheated insulation; electrical equipment which either fails to operate
or operates irregularly; and electrical equipment which produces excessive vibrations are also indications
of malfunctions. When any of the above signs are noted, they are to be reported immediately to a
qualified technician. DO NOT DELAY. Do not operate faulty equipment. Above all, do not attempt to
make any repairs yourself if you are not qualified to do so. Stand clear of any suspected hazard and
instruct others to do likewise.
