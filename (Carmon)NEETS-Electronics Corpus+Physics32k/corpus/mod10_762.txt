The TURNSTILE ANTENNA is one of the many types that has been developed primarily for 
omnidirectional vhf communications. The basic turnstile consists of two horizontal half-wave antennas 
mounted at right angles to each other in the same horizontal plane. When these two antennas are excited 
with equal currents 90 degrees out of phase, the typical figure-eight patterns of the two antennas merge to 
produce the nearly circular pattern shown in figure 4-39, view A. Pairs of such antennas are frequently 
stacked, as shown in figure 4-40. Each pair is called a BAY. In figure 4-40 two bays are used and are 
spaced 1/2 wavelength apart, and the corresponding elements are excited in phase. These conditions cause 
a part of the vertical radiation from each bay to cancel that of the other bay. This results in a decrease in 
energy radiated at high vertical angles and increases the energy radiated in the horizontal plane. Stacking 
a number of bays can alter the vertical radiation pattern, causing a substantial gain in a horizontal 
direction without altering the overall horizontal directivity pattern. Figure 4-39, view B, compares the 
circular vertical radiation pattern of a single-bay turnstile with the sharp pattern of a four-bay turnstile 
array. A three-dimensional radiation pattern of a four-bay turnstile antenna is shown in figure 4-39, view 
C.
