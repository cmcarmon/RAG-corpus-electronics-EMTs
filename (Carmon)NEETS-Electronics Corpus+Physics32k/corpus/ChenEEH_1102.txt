a mainstay of the industry. ODE is especially useful for pro-
ducing thin membranes that serve as the sensitive element in
MEM pressure sensors. It is employed for production of these
and other commercial MEMS devices. The second approach to
bulk micromachining is using plasma-based etching processes
that attack the substrate, usually silicon, in preferential direc-
tions. Deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) is a plasma process that
is used increasingly to make MEMS. It can produce structures
that are over ten times as deep as they are wide.
