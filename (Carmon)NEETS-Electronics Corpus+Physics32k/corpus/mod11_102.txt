The function of the CATCHER GRIDS is to absorb energy from the electron beam. The catcher 
grids are placed along the beam at a point where the bunches are fully formed. The location is determined 
by the transit time of the bunches at the natural resonant frequency of the cavities (the resonant frequency 
of the catcher cavity is the same as the buncher cavity). The location is chosen because maximum energy 
transfer to the output (catcher) cavity occurs when the electrostatic field is of the correct polarity to slow 
down the electron bunches.
