Sequential ATP  generation  is  more  difﬁcult  than  combinational ATPG  because  exercising  or  sensitizing  a
particular circuit path to detect the presence of a possible manufacturing fault may require a sequence of input
test vectors. One technique for testing sequential digital systems is scan fault testing. Scan fault testing is an
example of design for testability (DFT) because it modiﬁes or constrains a design in a manner that facilitates
fault testing. Scan techniques impose a logic design discipline that connects all state registers into one or more
chains to form “scan rings,” as shown in Fig. 34.19 [Eichelberger and Williams, 1977].
