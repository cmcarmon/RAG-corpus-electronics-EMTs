Beneﬁcial  effects  of  time-varying  electric  ﬁelds  in  wound  healing  are  most  likely  related  to  promotion  of
angiogenesis. Wound healing consists of several stages, the ﬁrst being inﬂammation, when changes in vascular
permeability occur; inﬁltration of leucocytes and macrophages takes place; and cells migrate, synthesize gran-
ulation tissue, collagen, and proteoglycans, and initiate formation of capillaries. This is followed by transitional
repair and remodeling phases. Electrical currents are probably only important in the ﬁrst two stages [Canaday
and Lee, 1991] and the experimental clinical trials performed thus far involve therapy for inﬂammation. One
was a double-blind study of persistent rotator cuff tendinitis [Binder et al., 1984] that showed beneﬁcial effects
of a PEMF very similar to the pseudarthrosis signal used by EBI (B in Table 113.2, described above in previous
section). Cuff tendinitis is probably due to partial interruption of blood supply to the rotator cuff tendons of
the shoulder by compression of vessels between adjacent bones. Another double-blind study [Ieran et al., 1990]
employing a PEMF signal indicated beneﬁcial effects in the treatment of skin ulcers.
