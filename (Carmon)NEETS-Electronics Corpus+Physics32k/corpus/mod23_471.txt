The hard disk drive connects to the host computer's bus with a 40-pin ribbon cable. The ribbon cable 
connects directly to either a 40-pin connector on the host computer's motherboard or a 40 pin connector 
on a small interface card that plugs into the host computer's motherboard. This interface offers a transfer 
rate of up to 1 MB and can handle hard drives with a maximum capacity of 300 MB.
