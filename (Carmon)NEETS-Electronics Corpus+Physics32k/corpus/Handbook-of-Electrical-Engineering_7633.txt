Since the ﬁrst demonstration of optical logic devices in the late 1970s, there have been many different experi-
mental devices reported. Figure 79.22 categorizes optical logic devices into four main classes. The ﬁrst division
is  between  all-optical  and  optoelectronic  devices.  All-optical  devices  are  devices  that  do  not  use  electrical
currents to create the nonlinearity required by digital devices. These devices can be either single-pass devices
(light  passes  through  the  nonlinear  material  once)  or  they  can  use  a  resonant  cavity  to  further  enhance  the
optical  nonlinearity  (multiple  passes  through  the  same  nonlinear  material).  Optoelectronic  devices,  on  the
other hand, use electrical currents and electronic devices to process a signal that has gone through an optical-
to-electrical conversion process. The output of these devices is either provided by electrically driving an optical
source such as a laser or LED (detect/emit) or by modulating some external light source (detect/modulate).
Below each of these categories are listed some of the devices that have been experimentally demonstrated.
