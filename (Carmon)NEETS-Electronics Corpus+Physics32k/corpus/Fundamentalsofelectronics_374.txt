We have a choice: we can ﬁnd the complex spectral coeﬃcients ck or we can ﬁnd the classic
series coeﬃcients. Given one result, we can ﬁnd the other. In general, ﬁnding the complex-valued
coeﬃcients is easier, but in this case let’s ﬁnd the classic series coeﬃcients because of the presence
of the sinusoid in the signal’s expression. Begin with the sine terms in the series; to ﬁnd bk we must
calculate the integral
