The solution as a voltage vector is at “x”. E1 = 24.000 V, E2 = 17.655 V, E3 = 19.310 V. These
three voltages compare to the previous mesh current and SPICE solutions to the unbalanced
bridge problem. This is no coincidence, for the 0.13609 A current source was purposely chosen
to yield the 24 V used as a voltage source in that problem.
