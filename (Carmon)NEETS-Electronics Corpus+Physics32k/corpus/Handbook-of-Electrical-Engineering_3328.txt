Light falling on the cathode causes electrons to be emitted in proportion to the light intensity. These electrons
are  accelerated  and  focused  by  the  applied  electric  ﬁeld  onto  the  ﬂuorescent  screen  to  form  a  visible  image.
Luminance gains of 50–100 times can be achieved, and a sequence of devices can be used to magnify the gain
even more.
