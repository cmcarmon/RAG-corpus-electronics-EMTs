The second test involves reversing the ohmmeter leads between anodes 1 and 2 so that the positive
lead is connected to anode 1 and the negative lead is connected to anode 2. Again, short the gate to anode
2; then remove it. The resistance reading should again drop to a low value and remain low until either of
the ohmmeter leads is disconnected.
