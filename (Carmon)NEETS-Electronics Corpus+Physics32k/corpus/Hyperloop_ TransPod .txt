TransPod Inc. is a Canadian company designing and manufacturing ultra-high-speed tube transportation technology and vehicles. In November 2016 TransPod raised a $15 million USD seed round from Angelo Investments, an Italian high-tech holding group, specializing in advanced technologies for the railway, space, and aviation industries.
In September 2017, TransPod released a scientific peer-reviewed publication in the journal Procedia Engineering. The paper was premiered at the EASD EURODYN 2017 conference, and presents the physics of the TransPod system.
TransPod vehicles are being designed to travel at over 1000 km/h between cities using fully electric propulsion and zero need for fossil fuels. The TransPod tube system is distinct from the hyperloop concept proposed by Elon Musk’s Hyperloop Alpha white paper. The TransPod system uses moving electromagnetic fields to propel the vehicles with stable levitation off the bottom surface, rather than compressed air. TransPod is stated to contain further developments beyond hyperloop. To achieve fossil-fuel-free propulsion, TransPod "pods" take advantage of electrically-driven linear induction motor technology, with active real-time control and sense-space systems. The cargo transport TransPod pods will be able to carry payloads of 10-15 tons and have compatibility with wooden pallets, as well as various unit load devices such as LD3 containers, and AAA containers.
At the InnoTrans Rail Show 2016 in Berlin, TransPod premiered their vehicle concept, alongside implementation of Coelux technology - an artificial skylight to emulate natural sunlight within the passenger pods.
TransPod has partnered with investor Angelo Investments' member companies MERMEC, SITAEL and Blackshape Aircraft. With international staff of over 1,000 employees, 650 of whom are engineers, they will collaborate with the development and testing of the TransPod tube system It has since expanded from its Toronto, Canada headquarters at MaRS Discovery District to open offices in Toulouse, France and Bari, Italy. TransPod is additionally partnered with university researchers, engineering firm IKOS, REC Architecture and Liebherr-Aerospace.
TransPod is developing routes worldwide and in Canada such as Toronto-Montreal, Toronto-Windsor, and Calgary-Edmonton. TransPod is preparing to build a test track for the pod vehicles in Canada. This track will be extendable as part of a full route pending a combination of private and public funding to construct the line.
In July 2017, TransPod released an initial cost study which outlines the viability of building a hyperloop line in Southwestern Ontario between the cities of Windsor and Toronto. The study indicates a TransPod tube system would cost half the projected cost of a high-speed rail line along the same route, while operating at more than four times the top speed of high speed rail.
TransPod has announced plans for a test track to be constructed in the town of Droux near Limoges in collaboration with the French department of Haute-Vienne. The proposed test track would exceed 3km in length, and operate as a half-scale system 2m in diameter.    In February 2018 Vincent Leonie, vice president of Limoges Métropole and a deputy mayor of Limoges , has announced agreements for the "Hyperloop Limoges" organization have been signed to promote and accelerate the technology.
