Time of flight measurements have been conducted to measure differences in the velocities of electrons and light at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory. For instance, Brown et al. (1973) found no difference in the time of flight of 11-GeV electrons and visible light, setting an upper limit of velocity differences of

{\displaystyle \Delta v/c=(-1.3\pm 2.7)\times 10^{-6}}
. Another SLAC experiment conducted by Guiragossián et al. (1974) accelerated electrons up to energies of 15 to 20.5 GeV. They used a radio frequency separator (RFS) to measure time-of-flight differences and thus velocity differences between those electrons and 15-GeV gamma rays on a path length of 1015 m. They found no difference, increasing the upper limit to

Already before, Alväger et al. (1964) at the CERN Proton Synchrotron executed a time of flight measurement to test the Newtonian momentum relations for light, being valid in the so-called emission theory. In this experiment, gamma rays were produced in the decay of 6-GeV pions traveling at 0.99975c. If Newtonian momentum

were valid, those gamma rays should have traveled at superluminal speeds. However, they found no difference and gave an upper limit of
