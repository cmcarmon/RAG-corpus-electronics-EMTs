Thus,  if  one  complete  cycle  (2a radians)  is 
completed in 0.02 s (i.e. T = 20 ms) an angle of p 
radians will correspond to a time of 0.01  (i.e. t =
10 ms). It should be apparent from this that, when 
considering  waveforms,  time  and  angle  (whether 
expressed 
are 
interchangeable. Note that the general equation for 
a sine wave voltage is: 
v V
where  Vmax  is  the  maximum  value  of  the  voltage 
and T is the periodic time.  
 
Graphs of trigonometrical functions 
To  plot  a  graph  of  y  =  sin  8 we  can  construct  a 
table of values of sin 8 as 8 is varied from 0° to 
360°  in  suitable  steps.  This  exercise  (carried  out 
using  a  scientific  calculator)  will  produce  a  table 
that looks something like this:
