The oblateness of the earth causes the right ascension of the ascending node W (Fig. 74.3) to move with time
in the equatorial plane in a direction opposite to the satellite√≠s motion as seen from above the ascending node.
This  is  called  regression  of  the  nodes.  For  inclination  i  <  90(cid:176)  (prograde  orbit)  the  ascending  node  rotates
westward. For i > 90(cid:176) (retrograde orbit) the ascending node rotates eastward. For  i = 90(cid:176) the regression is zero.
The orbit parameters may be chosen such that the nodal regression is 360(cid:176)/365.24 = 0.9856(cid:176) eastward per day.
In that case, the orbit plane will maintain a constant angle with the sun. The local solar time for the line of
nodes is constant, that is, the satellite crosses a given latitude at the same solar time and same solar lighting
conditions each day. This sun-synchronous orbit has advantages for certain applications such as weather and
surveillance satellites [Roddy, 1996 p. 60].
