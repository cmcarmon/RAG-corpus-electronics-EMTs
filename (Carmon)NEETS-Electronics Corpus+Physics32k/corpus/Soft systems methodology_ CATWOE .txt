In 1975, David Smyth, a researcher in Checkland's department, observed that SSM was most successful when the Root Definition included certain elements. These elements, captured in the mnemonic CATWOE, identified the people, processes and environment that contribute to a situation, issue or problem that required analyzing.
This is used to prompt thinking about what the business is trying to achieve. Business Perspectives help the Business Analyst to consider the impact of any proposed solution on the people involved. There are six elements of CATWOE
Customers - Who are the beneficiaries of the highest level business process and how does the issue affect them?
Actors - Who is involved in the situation, who will be involved in implementing solutions and what will impact their success?
Transformation Process - What is the transformation that lies at the heart of the system - transforming grapes into wine, transforming unsold goods into sold goods, transforming a societal need into a societal need met?
Weltanschauung (or Worldview) - What is the big picture and what are the wider impacts of the issue?
Owner - Who owns the process or situation being investigated and what role will they play in the solution?
Environmental Constraints - What are the constraints and limitations that will impact the solution and its success?
