{\displaystyle T_{c}[K]\,=\,T_{b}\left[0.584+0.965\sum {T_{c,i}}-\left(\sum {T_{c,i}}\right)^{2}\right]^{-1}}

This critical temperature equation needs a normal boiling point Tb. If an experimental value is available it is recommended to use this boiling point. It is, on the other hand, also possible to input the normal boiling point estimated by the Joback method. This will lead to a higher error.
