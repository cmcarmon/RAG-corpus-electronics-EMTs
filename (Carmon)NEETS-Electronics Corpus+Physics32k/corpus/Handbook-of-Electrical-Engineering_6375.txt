Channel encoder: A  device  that  converts  source-encoded  digital  information  into  an  analog  RF  signal  for
transmission. The type of modulation used depends on the particular digital audio broadcasting (DAB)
system, although most modulation techniques employ methods by which the transmitted signal can be
made more resistant to frequency-selective signal fading and multipath distortion effects.
