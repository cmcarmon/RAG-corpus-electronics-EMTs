Validation and Error Checking
One of the most time consuming and long lasting of the tasks associated with any model development is that
of validation. Long after work on the model has been completed, questions will continue to arise about whether
a given result is valid or whether the model can be applied to a given problem. There are essentially two kinds
of validation procedures that can be considered to answer such questions: (1) internal validation, a check that
can  be  made  concerning  solution  validity  within  the  model  itself;  and  (2)  external  validation,  a  check  that
utilizes information from other sources which could be analytical, experimental, or numerical.
