Although the size of the em ultimately depends on the point size, or height of the metal body of a letter, it is also used as a measure of horizontal spacing relative to the type size, with vertical spacing being measured in picas or points. One em was traditionally defined as the width of the capital M in the current typeface and point size, because the M was commonly cast the full-width of the square blocks, or em-quads (also mutton-quads), which are used in printing presses.
In modern typefaces, the character M is usually somewhat less than one em wide. Moreover, as type includes a wider variety of languages and character sets than just those based on Latin, and needs a consistent way to refer to size, its meaning evolved long ago; this allowed it to include fonts, typefaces, and character sets which do not include a capital M, such as Chinese and Arabic. Because of how digital type works, the em now always means the point size of the font in question.
