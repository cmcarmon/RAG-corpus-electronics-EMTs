Most ac power distribution systems in naval vessels are 440-volt, 60-hertz, 3-phase, 3-wire, 
ungrounded systems. The ac power distribution system consists of the power source, equipment to 
distribute the power, and the equipment which uses the power. A partial distribution chart is shown in 
figure 4-11.
