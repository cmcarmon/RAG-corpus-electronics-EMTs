We can look at Figure 4.7 to see the power spectrum and the rms approximation error for the square
wave. Because the Fourier coeﬃcients decay more slowly here than for the half-wave rectiﬁed sinusoid, the
rms error is not decreasing quickly. Said another way, the square-wave’s spectrum contains more power at
higher frequencies than does the half-wave-rectiﬁed sinusoid. This diﬀerence between the two Fourier series
results because the half-wave rectiﬁed sinusoid’s Fourier coeﬃcients are proportional to 1
k2 while those of the
square wave are proportional to 1
. If fact, after 99 terms of the square wave’s approximation, the error is
k
bigger than 10 terms of the approximation for the half-wave rectiﬁed sinusoid. Mathematicians have shown
that no signal has an rms approximation error that decays more slowly than it does for the square wave.
