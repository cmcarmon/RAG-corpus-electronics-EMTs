Grounds are usually indicated by blown fuses or tripped circuit breakers. Blown fuses or tripped
circuit breakers, however, can also result from a short circuit other than a ground. A high-resistance
ground can also occur when current is increased significantly but not enough to rupture the fuse or trip the
circuit breaker.
