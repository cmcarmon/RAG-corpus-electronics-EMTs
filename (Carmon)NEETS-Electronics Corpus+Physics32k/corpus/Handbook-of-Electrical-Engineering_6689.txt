The philosophy of the ISO/OSI architecture is that in addition to the software being layered, implementations
are not allowed to bypass entire layers; that is, every layer must appear in the implementation. This approach
was developed after the approach deÔ¨Åned for the ARPANET project, which is hierarchical, was fully developed.
In the hierarchical approach, the layer interfaces are carefully designed, but any number of layers of software
can be bypassed by any application (or other higher-layer protocol) that provides the appropriate functionality.
These two approaches have been hotly debated for a number of years, but as the years pass, the approaches are
actually beginning to look more and more alike for a variety of reasons that will not be discussed here.
