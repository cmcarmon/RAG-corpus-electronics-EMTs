Another common term is power conversion. Power is used by electrical devices and is converted
from one form of energy to another. An electrical motor converts electrical energy to mechanical energy.
An electric light bulb converts electrical energy into light energy and an electric range converts electrical
energy into heat energy. Power used by electrical devices is measured in energy. This practical unit of
electrical energy is equal to 1 watt of power used continuously for 1 hour. The term kilowatt hour (kWh)
is used more extensively on a daily basis and is equal to 1,000 watt-hours.
