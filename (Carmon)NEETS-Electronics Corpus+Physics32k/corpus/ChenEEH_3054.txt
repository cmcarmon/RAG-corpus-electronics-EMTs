The locations where transmission and distribution lines are
connected through switches (circuit breakers) and transform-
ers are known as switchyards or substations. The design of
these substations becomes more complex with higher voltages
and the numbers of lines and transformers. In less crowded
areas these substations can take up many acres of open space,
but it becomes more difﬁcult to ﬁt equipment into limited
urban spaces. In addition, special insulating techniques for
