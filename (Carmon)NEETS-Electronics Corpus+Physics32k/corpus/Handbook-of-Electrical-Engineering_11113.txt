One theory assumes that ion transfer through cell membranes is affected by cyclotron resonance [Liboff and
c = 2pfc of several physiologically
McLeod, 1988]. It is based on the fact that the cyclotron resonance frequency w
important ions of charge Q and mass m, in the steady magnetic Ô¨Åeld B0 of the earth, falls into the ELF range:
