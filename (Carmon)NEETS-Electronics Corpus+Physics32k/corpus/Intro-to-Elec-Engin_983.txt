A mechanical force is exerted on ferromagnetic material, tending to align it with or bring it
into the position of the densest part of the magnetic ﬁeld. This force is the familiar attraction of a
magnet for pieces of iron in its ﬁeld. In magnetic circuits, for example, deﬁnite forces are exerted
on the iron at the air–iron boundary. Energy changes associated with a differential displacement of
the iron cause the mechanical force. This force is the essential operating mechanism of many elec-
tromagnetic devices, such as lifting magnets, magnetic clutches, chucks, brakes, switches (known
as contactors), and relays. Solenoid-operated (solenoid being another name for the operating coil)
valves are common elements in piping systems. Actuators used in control systems operate due to
the mechanical force or torque converted from the electric, pneumatic, or hydraulic inputs.
