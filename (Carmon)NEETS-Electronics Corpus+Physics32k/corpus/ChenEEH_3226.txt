Spot networks are used in downtown areas for high-rise
buildings with extremely high load densities and sometimes
also for areas of industrial or commercial consumers. Often,
large shopping centers are supplied by spot networks. In such a
network, all transformers and protecting equipment are placed
at the same location.
