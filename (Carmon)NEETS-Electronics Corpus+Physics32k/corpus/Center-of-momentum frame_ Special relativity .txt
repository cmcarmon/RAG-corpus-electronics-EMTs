In relativity, COM frame exists for an isolated massive system. This is a consequence of Noether's theorem. In the COM frame the total energy of the system is the rest energy, and this quantity (when divided by the factor c2, where c is the speed of light) gives the rest mass (invariant mass) of the system:

{\displaystyle m_{0}={\frac {E_{0}}{c^{2}}}.}

The invariant mass of the system is given in any inertial frame by the relativistic invariant relation

{\displaystyle m_{0}{}^{2}=\left({\frac {E}{c^{2}}}\right)^{2}-\left({\frac {p}{c}}\right)^{2},}

but for zero momentum the momentum term (p/c)2 vanishes and thus the total energy coincides with the rest energy.
Systems that have nonzero energy but zero rest mass (such as photons moving in a single direction, or equivalently, plane electromagnetic waves) do not have COM frames, because there is no frame in which they have zero net momentum. Due to the invariance of the speed of light, such massless systems must travel at the speed of light in any frame, and therefore always possess a net momentum magnitude that is equal to their energy divided by the speed of light:
