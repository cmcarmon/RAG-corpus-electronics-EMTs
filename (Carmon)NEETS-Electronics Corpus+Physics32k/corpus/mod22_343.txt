Communications software and hardware enable you to transmit and receive text on your 
microcomputer. Many organizations use this capability for electronic mail. In a matter of minutes you can 
enter and transmit a memo to other commands or to personnel in other locations. You can transmit 
monthly reports, notices, or any documents prepared on the microcomputer.
