In the absence of matter parity, supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model can give rise to the last operator suppressed by the inverse square of sdown quark mass. This is due to the dimension-4 operators qld͂c and ucdcd͂c.
The proton decay rate is only suppressed by

which is far too fast unless the couplings are very small.
