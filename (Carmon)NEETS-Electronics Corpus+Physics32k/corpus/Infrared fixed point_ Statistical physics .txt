In the statistical physics of second order phase transitions, the physical system approaches an infrared fixed point that is independent of the initial short distance dynamics that defines the material. This determines the properties of the phase transition at the critical temperature, or critical point. Observables, such as critical exponents usually depend only upon dimension of space, and are independent of the atomic or molecular constituents.
