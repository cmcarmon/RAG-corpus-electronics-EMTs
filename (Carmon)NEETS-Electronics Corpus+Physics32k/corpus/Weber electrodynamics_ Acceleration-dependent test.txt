Test charges inside a spherical conducting shell will experience different behaviors depending on the force law the test charge is subject to. By measuring the oscillation frequency of a neon lamp inside a spherical conductor biased to a high voltage, this can be tested. Again, no significant deviations from the Maxwell theory have been observed.
