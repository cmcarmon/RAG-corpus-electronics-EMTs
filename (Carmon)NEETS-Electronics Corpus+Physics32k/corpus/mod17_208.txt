In this example, a modulation index of 4 equates to 14 significant sidebands. Because the audio
frequency is 10 kilohertz and there are 14 side-bands, the bandwidth must accommodate a 140-kilohertz
signal. You can see this is considerably wider than the 10-to-15-kilohertz bandpass used in AM
transmitting.
