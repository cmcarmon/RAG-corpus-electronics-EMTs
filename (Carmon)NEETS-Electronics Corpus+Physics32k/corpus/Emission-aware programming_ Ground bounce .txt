Ground bounce is a voltage bounce caused by simultaneous switching of several outputs from one logic state to the other, for example from high to low. The voltage built up across the parasitic inductance of the IC ground return connection causes a transient voltage potential shift in the ground reference potential with respect to the system ground. Ground bounce is caused by CMOS crowbar current and the dynamic switching currents of capacitive loads.
