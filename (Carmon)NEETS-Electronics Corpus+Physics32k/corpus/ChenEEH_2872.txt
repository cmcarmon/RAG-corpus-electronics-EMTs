where u0 and um are the angular limits that the beam follows in a
csc2 shape. The cosecant-squared antenna has the important
property of the echo power received from a target of constant
RCS at a constant altitude being independent of the target range.
The cassegrain antenna is the most common antenna using
multiple reﬂectors. In the cassegrain antenna, the feed, placed
at or near the paraboloid main reﬂector, illuminates the hyper-
boloidal subreﬂector, which in turn illuminates the parabo-
loidal main reﬂector.
