This is an amazing result. It can be easily proved with the use of Kirchhoff â€™s two laws.1 The products of v
and i are reminiscent of power as in Eq. (3.1). However, the product of the voltage of a branch in one network
and the current of its topologically corresponding branch (which may not even be the same type of component)
in another network does not constitute power in either branch. furthermore, the variables in one network might
be functions of time, while those of the other network might be steady-state phasors or Laplace transforms.
