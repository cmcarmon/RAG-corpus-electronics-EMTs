Let us now answer the second question of large signal analysis, namely, what
are valid input and output voltage ranges for the amplifier under the saturation
discipline? These ranges will provide the outer voltage limits to input signals
such as those in Figure 7.35. The limits will also provide insights into the
nominal voltage about which the input signal should be centered, or, in other
words, how to choose the operating point of the amplifier.
