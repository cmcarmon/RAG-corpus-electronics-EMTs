DAMPING is used to smooth out the vibration and to help prevent overshooting of the meter
pointer. Damping in a dâ€™Arsonval meter movement is accomplished by the emf caused by the coil
movement. A second damping system uses a vane attached to the coil in an airtight chamber. A meter
movement reacts to the average value of ac, but the scale is calibrated to read the effective (rms) value.
