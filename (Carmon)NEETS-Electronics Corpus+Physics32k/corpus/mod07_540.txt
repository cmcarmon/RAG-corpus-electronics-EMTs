Notice that C1 and CR1 work exactly like a half-wave rectifier. During the positive alternation of the 
input cycle (view A), the polarity across the secondary winding of the transformer is as shown. Note that 
the top of the secondary is negative. At this time CR1 is forward biased (cathode negative in respect to the 
anode). This forward bias causes CR1 to function like a closed switch and allows current to follow the 
path indicated by the arrows. At this time, C1 charges to the peak value of the input voltage, or 200 volts, 
with the polarity shown.
