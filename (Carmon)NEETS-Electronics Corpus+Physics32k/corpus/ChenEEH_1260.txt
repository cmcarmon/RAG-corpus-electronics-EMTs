. Registers are small areas of extremely high-speed memory
used to store data that will be processed by the CPU.
Generally, a register can hold only a few bytes of data,
which can be the operands, the results, or the memory
addresses that can be accessed in one clock cycle. These
registers then form general-purpose register ﬁles that can
be used by the CPU. In many of today’s CPUs, the size of
a register ﬁle is 32 entries.
