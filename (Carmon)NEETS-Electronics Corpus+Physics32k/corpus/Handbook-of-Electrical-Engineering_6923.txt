The accuracy of approximating a rv A as a linear function of another rv B, A » cB + d, for real coefﬁcients
c and d, is found by minimizing the mean-square error e =  E{[A – (cB + d)]2}. Upon squaring and taking the
expected values, we can obtain e
* to be a measure of the degree of linear
* £  1,  which  demonstrates  the  Cauchy-
relationship  between  A  and  B.  Because e
