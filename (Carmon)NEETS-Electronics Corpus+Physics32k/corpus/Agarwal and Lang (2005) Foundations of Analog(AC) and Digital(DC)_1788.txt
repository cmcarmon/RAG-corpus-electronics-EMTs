Now, an interesting scenario arises if we close S1 and open S2 after the capacitor voltage
has risen past V, but before the current reverses direction. Since S2 is now open, the
capacitor has no path to discharge, and so it holds the final value of its voltage. Then
when S1 is opened and S2 is closed again, the inductor current charges up the capacitor
further, thereby further increasing its voltage. If this process is repeated, notice that the
capacitor voltage will keep rising indefinitely over time.
