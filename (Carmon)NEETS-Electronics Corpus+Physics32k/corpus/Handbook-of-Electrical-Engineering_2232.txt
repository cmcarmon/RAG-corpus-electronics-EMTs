The limiting value vs of the drift velocity in a strong electric ﬁeld is known as the saturation velocity and is
usually within the 107–3·107 cm/s range. As semiconductor device dimensions are scaled down to the submi-
crometer range, vs becomes an important parameter that determines the upper limits of device performance.
