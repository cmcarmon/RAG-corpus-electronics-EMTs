. Beamforming: If the array is only used for reception, the
antenna pattern can be digitally ‘‘beamformed.’’ The
output from each array element may be ampliﬁed and
sampled. The sampled signals are then transferred to a
computer for processing. The beam pattern can be
formed digitally by applying suitable beamforming algo-
rithms.
