Figure 3-34 shows the magnetization and permeability curves for a saturable-core reactor with the
ideal operating point (point "O") indicated. Notice point "O" on the magnetization curve. The portion of
the magnetization curve where point "O" is located is called the KNEE OF THE CURVE. The knee of the
curve is the point of maximum curvature. It is called the "knee" because it looks like the knee of a leg that
is bent. Saturable-core reactors and magnetic amplifiers should be operated on the knee of the
magnetization curve.
