The circuit shown in Figure 36-20 provides a con-
stant output voltage for a changing input voltage. Any 
change in the voltage appears across the resistor. The 
sum of the voltage drops must equal the input voltage. 
By changing the output zener diode and the series re-
sistor, the output voltage can be increased or decreased.
The load resistance and the output voltage deter-
mine the current through the load. The load current 
and the zener current flow through the series resistor. 
The series resistor must be chosen carefully so that the 
zener current keeps the zener diode in the breakdown 
zone and allows the current to flow.
