IS-95 CDMA
The IS-95 CDMA air interface standard, after the ﬁrst revision
in 1995, was termed IS-95A; it speciﬁes the air interface for
cellular, 800-MHz frequency band. ANSI J-STD-008 speciﬁes
the air interface for 1900 MHz in PCS. It differs from IS-95A
primarily in the frequency plan and in call processing related to
subscriber station identity, such as paging and call origination.
TSB74 speciﬁes the Rate Set 2 standard. IS-95B merges the IS-
95A, ANSI J-STD-008, and TSB74 standards. In addition, it
speciﬁes high-speed data operation using up to eight parallel
codes, resulting in a maximum bit rate of 115.2 Kb/s. Table 7.1
lists the main parameters of the IS-95 CDMA air interface.
