This  section  describes  the  basic  technology  for  the  transmission  of  various  video  formats.  We  begin  by
describing the most common video formats and deﬁning transmission requirements for each. Sources of noise,
 (RIN), and receiver noise are then quantiﬁed. Limitations imposed
including shot noise,
