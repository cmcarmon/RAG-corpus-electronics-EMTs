Simplicity of implementation (as bearing cages, carriers, simplified suspension, and mounting systems are not necessary);
Increased efficiency due to decreased sliding friction losses;
May require fewer satellite gears, as their orbital motion is prescribed by gear engagement;
Possibility of use for direct visualization in measuring instruments.
