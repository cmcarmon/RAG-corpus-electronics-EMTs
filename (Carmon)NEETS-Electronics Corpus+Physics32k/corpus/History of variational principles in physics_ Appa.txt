Although equivalent mathematically, there is an important philosophical difference between the differential equations of motion and their integral counterpart. The differential equations are statements about quantities localized to a single point in space or single moment of time. For example, Newton's second law



F
=
m
a


{\displaystyle F=ma}
states that the instantaneous force



F


{\displaystyle F}
applied to a mass



m


{\displaystyle m}
produces an acceleration



a


{\displaystyle a}
at the same instant. By contrast, the action principle is not localized to a point; rather, it involves integrals over an interval of time and (for fields) extended region of space. Moreover, in the usual formulation of classical action principles, the initial and final states of the system are fixed, e.g.,
Given that the particle begins at position




x

1




{\displaystyle x_{1}}
at time




t

1




{\displaystyle t_{1}}
and ends at position




x

2




{\displaystyle x_{2}}
at time




t

2




{\displaystyle t_{2}}
, the physical trajectory that connects these two endpoints is an extremum of the action integral.
In particular, the fixing of the final state appears to give the action principle a teleological character which has been controversial historically. This apparent teleology is eliminated in the quantum mechanical version of the action principle.
