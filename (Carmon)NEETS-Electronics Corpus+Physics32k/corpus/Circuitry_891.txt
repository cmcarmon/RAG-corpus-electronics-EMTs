Example 19.3 
 
A transistor  has  an  absolute  maximum  junction 
temperature rating of 150° and a thermal resistance 
from junction to case of 1.0°C/W. If the device is 
fitted  with  a  washer  and  mounting  kit  having  a 
thermal  resistance  of  1.25°C/W  and  a  heatsink  of 
2.75°C/W, determine whether the maximum ratings 
are  exceeded  when  the  total  power  dissipation 
reaches  a  maximum  of  25  W  at  a  maximum 
ambient temperature of 40°C. 
 
Applying equation (6) gives:
