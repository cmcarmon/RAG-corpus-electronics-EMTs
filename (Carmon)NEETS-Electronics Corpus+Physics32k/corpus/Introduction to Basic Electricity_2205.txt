electromagnetic	induction is the principle be-
hind the generation of electricity: When a conduc-
tor passes or is passed by a magnetic field, a  current 
is  produced  (induced)  in  the  conductor.  As  the 
 conductor passes through the magnetic field, free elec-
trons are forced to one end of the conductor, leaving a 
 deficiency of electrons at the other end. This results in 
a difference of potential between the ends of the con-
ductor. This difference of potential exists only when 
the conductor is passing through a magnetic field. 
When the conductor is removed from the magnetic 
field, the free electrons return to their parent atoms.
