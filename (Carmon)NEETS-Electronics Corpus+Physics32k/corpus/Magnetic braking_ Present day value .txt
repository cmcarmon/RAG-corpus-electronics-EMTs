{\displaystyle r_{c}=3.4R_{\odot }}
. This means that the ionized plasma will rotate together with the Sun as a solid body until it reaches a distance of nearly 3.4 the radius of the Sun; from there the material will break off and stop affecting the Sun.
The amount of solar mass needed to be thrown out along the field lines to make the Sun completely stop rotating can then be calculated using the specific angular momentum:

{\displaystyle {\frac {j_{\odot }}{j_{c}}}=\left({\frac {R_{\odot }}{r_{c}}}\right)^{2}\approx 10\%}

About 1/10 of the solar mass should thus have been lost by now due to this effect, but if the present mass loss rate was stable throughout the Sun's "life" only about 0.01% of the Sun's original mass would have been lost. This indicates that either the Sun's mass loss must have been higher in the past or that the Sun's magnetic field has been much stronger.
