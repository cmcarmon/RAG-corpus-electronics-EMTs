A nozzle for a supersonic flow must increase in area in the flow direction, and a diffuser must decrease in area, opposite to a nozzle and diffuser for a subsonic flow. So, for a supersonic flow to develop from a reservoir where the velocity is zero, the subsonic flow must first accelerate through a converging area to a throat, followed by continued acceleration through an enlarging area.
The nozzles on a rocket designed to place satellites in orbit are constructed using such converging-diverging geometry. The energy and continuity equations can take on particularly helpful forms for the steady, uniform, isentropic flow through the nozzle. Apply the energy equation with Q_ W_S 0 between the reservoir and some location in the nozzle to obtain

Any quantity with a zero subscript refers to a stagnation point where the velocity is zero, such as in the reservoir. Using several thermodynamic relations equations can be put in the forms:

If the above equations are applied at the throat (the critical area signified by an Asterisk (*) superscript, where M =1), the energy equation takes the forms

The critical area is often referenced even though a throat does not exist. For air with k =1.4, the equations above provide

T* = 0.833333·To
p* = 0.528282·po
ρ* = 0.633938·ρo
