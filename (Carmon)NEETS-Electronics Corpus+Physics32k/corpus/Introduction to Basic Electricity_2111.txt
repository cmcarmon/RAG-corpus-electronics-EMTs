What may not be obvious is that voltage dividers 
work on a ratio principle. Look at Figure 17-12.  Resistor 
R2 is 5 kΩ, which just happens to be half (or 50%) of 
the total network. It also happens to have half (or 50%) 
of the total supplied voltage dropped across it. Inspec-
tion of Figure 17-13 depicts a similar event occurring. 
Resistor R3 is 1 kΩ, which just happens to be one-tenth 
(or 10%) of the total network resistance. In this case, the 
voltage dropped across it is 10% of the supplied voltage, 
or 1 volt. The voltage R2 remains unchanged because 
the sum of the resistances R2 and R3 make up R2 volt-
age, and their combined value is still 5 kΩ.
