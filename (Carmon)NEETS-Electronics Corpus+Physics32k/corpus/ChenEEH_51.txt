In the solution of linear time-invariant differential equations,
it was noted that a forcing function of the form Kiest yields
an output of the form Koest where s is a complex variable. The
function est
is a complex sinusoid of exponentially varying
amplitude, often called a damped sinusoid. Because linear
equations obey the superposition principle, the solution of a
linear differential equation to any forcing function can be
found by superposing solutions to component-damped sinu-
soids if the forcing function is expressed as a sum of damped
