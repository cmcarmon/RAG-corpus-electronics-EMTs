In this circuit, a lamp is connected across the terminals of an inductor. A switch is used to
control current in the circuit, and power is supplied by a 6 volt battery. When the switch is
closed, the inductor will brieï¬‚y oppose the change in current from zero to some magnitude, but
will drop only a small amount of voltage. It takes about 70 volts to ionize the neon gas inside a
neon bulb like this, so the bulb cannot be lit on the 6 volts produced by the battery, or the low
voltage momentarily dropped by the inductor when the switch is closed:
