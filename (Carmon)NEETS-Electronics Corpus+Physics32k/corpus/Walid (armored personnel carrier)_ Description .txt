The vehicle consists of a German UNIMOG truck chassis with an Egyptian built armored body. The body was open-topped but fully enclosed versions were available. The open top versions have a canvas cover. The commander has a weapon mount, and others can be positioned along the edges of the roof along the hull sides and rear. The hull has a door on each side of the cab and one door in the rear of the hull. There are also three firing ports on each side of the hull. The Walid has no NBC or night vision system.
