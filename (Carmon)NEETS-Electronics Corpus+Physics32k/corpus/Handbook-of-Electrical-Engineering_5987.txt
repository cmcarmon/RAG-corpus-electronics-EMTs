Proper considerations to matching inputs to outputs of the connected templates are required when using
templates. Take, for example, a template of the above dc motor simulation. Such a template will require inputs
of Va, vf, and Tmech to produce outputs of Ia, if, ﬂux, and rotor speed. On the mechanical side, the motor template
has to be interfaced to the simulation of the mechanical prime mover or load for its remaining input of Tmech.
In the case of a simple load, the load torque, Tmech, could be constant or some simple function of rotor speed,
as shown in Fig. 66.32. On the electrical side, the motor template has to be interfaced to the templates of the
power supplies to the armature and ﬁeld windings for its inputs of Va and vf. These voltages can come from
