The bridge can be calibrated after completion of the preceding check. Connect the transmission line
under investigation to the output terminals of the bridge and connect a succession of noninductive
resistors (RO in view C) to the load end of the transmission line until the bridge is balanced. Assuming
that the bridge was originally balanced for the characteristic impedance of the line, the standing-wave
ratio can be computed from the following equation:
