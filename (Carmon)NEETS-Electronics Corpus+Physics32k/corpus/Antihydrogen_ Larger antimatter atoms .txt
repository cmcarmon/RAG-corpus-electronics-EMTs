Larger antimatter atoms such as antideuterium (D), antitritium (T), and antihelium (He) are much more difficult to produce. Antideuterium, antihelium-3 (3He) and antihelium-4 (4He) nuclei have been produced with such high velocities that synthesis of their corresponding atoms poses several technical hurdles.
