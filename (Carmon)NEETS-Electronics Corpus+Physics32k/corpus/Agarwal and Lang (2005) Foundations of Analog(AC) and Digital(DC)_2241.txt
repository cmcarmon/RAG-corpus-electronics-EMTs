Typical measured v i characteristics for a silicon diode are shown
âˆ’12 amps), as
in Figure 16.4. If we plot on a current scale of pico-amps (10
in Figure 16.4a, then the expected exponential shape appears. But if we plot on
a more typical scale of milliamps (Figure 16.4b), then the curve looks quite
different. The current appears to be zero until the diode voltage is almost
0.6 volts, at which point the characteristic rises very sharply. This apparent
knee is entirely due to the mathematical behavior of exponentials, rather than
some physically-related threshold in the device. Nonetheless, on the scale of
milliamperes, silicon diodes appear to have a voltage threshold of 0.6 to 0.7 V,
(0.2 V for germanium diodes). This threshold has important consequences for
semiconductor circuit design, some detrimental but others of great value. For
example, recall that digital logic depends critically on the presence of such a
threshold, as we saw in Chapter 6.
