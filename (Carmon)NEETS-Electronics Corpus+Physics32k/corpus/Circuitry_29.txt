The  triangle  shown  in  Fig.  1.5  should  help  you 
remember 
important  relationships. 
However,  it’s  worth  noting  that,  when  performing 
calculations of currents, voltages and resistances in 
practical  circuits  it  is  seldom  necessary  to  work 
with  an  accuracy  of  better  than  ±1%  simply 
because  component  tolerances  are  usually  greater 
than  this.  Furthermore,  in  calculations  involving 
Ohm’s  Law,  it  can  sometimes  be  convenient  to 
work  in  units  of  k< and  mA  (or  M< and  µA)  in 
which  case  potential  differences  will  be  expressed 
directly in V. 
 
Example 1.14 
 
A 12 < resistor is connected to a 6V battery. What 
current will flow in the resistor? 
 
Solution 
 
Here  we  must use I = V / R (where V = 6 V and  
R = 12 <): 
 
I = V / R = 6 V / 12 < = 0.5 A (or 500 mA) 
 
Hence a current of 500 mA will flow in the resistor. 
 
Example 1.15 
 
A current of 100 mA flows in a 56 < resistor. What 
voltage  drop 
(potential  difference)  will  be 
developed across the resistor? 
 
Solution 
 
Here  we  must  use  V = I × R and  ensure  that  we 
work in units of Volts (V), Amperes (A) and Ohms 
(<). 
 
V = I × R = 0.1 A × 56 < = 5.6 V 
 
(Note that 100 mA is the same as 0.1 A.) 
  This calculation shows  that a p.d. of 5.6 V will 
be developed across the resistor. 
 
Example 1.16 
 
A voltage drop of 15 V appears across a resistor in 
which a current of 1 mA flows. What is the value 
of the resistance?
