. Fixed routing: A central routing directory is created at
the network control computer. The directory contains the
source-destination pairs of LANs and the bridge ID for
each pair of LANs. Each bridge on the network has a table
that contains the source-destination pairs of LAN for
each of LANs attached to the bridge.
