Figure 2-45A, is a diagram of a typical nondegenerative parametric amplifier with the equivalent 
circuit shown in figure 2-45B. The pump signal (fp) is applied to the varactor. The cavity on the left is 
resonant at the input frequency (fs), and the cavity on the right is resonant at the difference frequency 
(fp-fs). The difference frequency is called the IDLER- or LOWER-SIDEBAND frequency. The varactor 
is located at the high-voltage points of the two cavities and is reverse biased by a small battery. The pump 
signal varies the bias above and below the fixed-bias level.
