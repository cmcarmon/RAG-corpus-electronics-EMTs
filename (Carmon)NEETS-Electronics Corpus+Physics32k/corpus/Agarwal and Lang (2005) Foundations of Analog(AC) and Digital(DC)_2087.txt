Parts (a) and (b) might lead you to believe that Thévenin’s Theorem also applies to
complex impedances. If this is true, then we can replace the circuit between Vo and
ground by a complex Thévenin impedance (Zth) and a complex open circuit voltage
(Voc). Taking vin1(t) = 10 cos(120πt) compute Zth and Voc.
to another circuit having vin2(t) = 10 cos(200t) as shown in Figure 14.57.
