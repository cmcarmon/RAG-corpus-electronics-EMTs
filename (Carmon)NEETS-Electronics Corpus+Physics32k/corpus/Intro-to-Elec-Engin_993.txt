Equation (12.2.6) may alternatively be obtained by the application of the cutting-of-ﬂux concept
given by Equation (12.1.3), from which the motional emf is given by the product of Bcoil times
the total active length of the conductors leff in the two coil sides times the linear velocity of the
conductor relative to the ﬁeld, provided that these three are mutually perpendicular. For the case
under consideration, then,
