characterize the system performance, but even loose bounds will be useful since they help verify the simulation
results. Most systems have parameters that can be varied. While it may be mathematically difÔ¨Åcult to determine
the performance of the system for arbitrary values, it is often possible to mathematically determine the results
when parameters assume extreme or degenerate values.
