You should know that the output of a power supply varies with changes in input voltage and circuit 
load current requirements. Because many electronic equipments require operating voltages and currents 
that must remain constant, some form of regulation is necessary. Circuits that maintain power supply 
voltages or current outputs within specified limits, or tolerances are called REGULATORS. They are 
designated as dc voltage or dc current regulators, depending on their specific application.
