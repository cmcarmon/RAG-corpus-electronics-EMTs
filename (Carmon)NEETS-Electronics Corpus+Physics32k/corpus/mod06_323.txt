The problem with the last solution is that the tube does not present an infinite resistance to current
flow. If the operating voltage is raised to an operating potential that is too high, arcing (arc over) occurs
between the cathode and the plate and, most likely, will destroy the tube. For this reason, the effects of
transit time are reduced in uhf tubes by placing the tube elements very close together.
