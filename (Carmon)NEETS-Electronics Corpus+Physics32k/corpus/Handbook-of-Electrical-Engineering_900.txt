4. Nodal  analysis  is  now  used  to  reduce  the  circuit  to  a  linear  algebraic  complex  matrix.  The  AC  node
voltages may now be found by applying an excitation vector (which represents the independent voltage
and current sources) and using Gaussian elimination (with complex arithmetic) to calculate the node
voltages.
