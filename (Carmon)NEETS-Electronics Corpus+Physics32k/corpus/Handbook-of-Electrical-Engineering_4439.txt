In the high- efﬁciency area, a C-band MMIC ampliﬁer with 70% PAE, 8-dB gain, and 1.7-W power output has
been  demonstrated.  For  broadband  ampliﬁers  having  an  octave  or  more  bandwidth,  MMIC  technology  has
been  exclusively  used  and  is  quite  promising.  Figure  43.5  depicts  power  performance  for  single-chip  MMIC
ampliﬁers  spanning  microwave  and  millimeter  wave  frequencies.  The  state  of  the  art  in  high  efﬁciency  and
broadband power MMIC ampliﬁers is summarized in Tables 43.2 and 43.3, respectively. Note that the high-
efﬁciency examples included in Table 43.2 all exceed 40% PAE.
