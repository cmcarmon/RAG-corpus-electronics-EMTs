The stages which multiply the frequency by two are DOUBLERS; those which multiply by four are 
QUADRUPLERS. The oscillator is tunable from 4 to 4.5 megahertz. The multiplier stages increase the 
frequency by multiplying successively by 4, 4, 2, and 2, for a total factor of 64. In high-power, high-
frequency transmitters, one or more intermediate amplifiers may be used between the last frequency 
multiplier and the power amplifier.
