The outer shell is called the valence	shell, and the 
number of electrons it contains is the valence. The 
farther the valence shell is from the nucleus, the less 
attraction the nucleus has on each valence electron. 
Thus the potential for the atom to gain or lose elec-
trons increases if the valence shell is not full and is lo-
cated far enough away from the nucleus. Conductivity 
of an atom depends on its valence band. The greater 
the number of electrons in the valence shell, the less 
it conducts. For example, an atom having seven elec-
trons in the valence shell is less conductive than an 
atom having three electrons in the valence shell.
