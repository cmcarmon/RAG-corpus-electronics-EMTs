The density





L




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}}
has units of J·m−3. The interaction term mΦ is replaced by a term involving a continuous mass density ρ in kg·m−3. This is necessary because using a point source for a field would result in mathematical difficulties. The resulting Lagrangian for the classical gravitational field is:

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}(\mathbf {x} ,t)=-\rho (\mathbf {x} ,t)\Phi (\mathbf {x} ,t)-{1 \over 8\pi G}(\nabla \Phi (\mathbf {x} ,t))^{2}}

where G in m3·kg−1·s−2 is the gravitational constant. Variation of the integral with respect to Φ gives:

{\displaystyle \delta {\mathcal {L}}(\mathbf {x} ,t)=-\rho (\mathbf {x} ,t)\delta \Phi (\mathbf {x} ,t)-{2 \over 8\pi G}(\nabla \Phi (\mathbf {x} ,t))\cdot (\nabla \delta \Phi (\mathbf {x} ,t)).}

Integrate by parts and discard the total integral. Then divide out by δΦ to get:
