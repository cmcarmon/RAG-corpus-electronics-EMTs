However, even with all that checking, we still haven’t covered all possibilities yet. Remem-
ber that hazardous voltage can appear between a single wire and ground (in this case, the
metal frame of the cabinet would be a good ground reference point) in a power system. So, to
be perfectly safe, we not only have to check between A & B, B & C, and A & C (in both AC
and DC modes), but we also have to check between A & ground, B & ground, and C & ground
(in both AC and DC modes)! This makes for a grand total of twelve voltage checks for this
seemingly simple scenario of only three wires. Then, of course, after we’ve completed all these
checks, we need to take our multimeter and re-test it against a known source of voltage such
as a power receptacle to ensure that its still in good working order.
