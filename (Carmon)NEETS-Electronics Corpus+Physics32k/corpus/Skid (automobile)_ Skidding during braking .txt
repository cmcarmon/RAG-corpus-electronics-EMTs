This is the simplest type of skid, where directional changes are not relevant, and the vehicle merely locks up the tires moving forwards in a straight line. If all four tires start to skid approximately evenly, then a vehicle will not start rotating due to the skid, and can come to a stop with locked up tires at a somewhat longer distance than threshold braking might have achieved.
