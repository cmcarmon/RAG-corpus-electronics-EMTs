Figure 3-5 shows the major units of this set. They are the radio transmitter, the radio frequency 
amplifier, the power supply, and the electrical equipment shock mount base. An antenna coupler group 
(consisting of a coupler and coupler control unit) is normally used to match the impedance of the system 
to a 50-ohm transmission line. If you want to operate with any 50-ohm antenna system, terminating 
connections are available.
