Both higher-end personal computers and workstations tend to have more main memory than the lower-end
systems, although they usually have similar upper limits. Two examples of such systems are workstations built
with the DEC Alpha 21164, and servers built with the Intel Pentium Pro. The Alpha systems, using the 21171
chip set, are limited to 128 Mbyte of main memory using 16 Mbit DRAMs, although they will be expandable
to  512  Mbyte  when  64-Mbit  DRAMs  are  available.  Their  memory  systems  are  8-way  simply  interleaved,
providing 128 bits per DRAM access. The Pentium Pro systems support slightly different features. The 82450KX
and 82450GX chip sets include memory controllers that allow reads to bypass writes (performing writes when
the memory banks are idle). These controllers can also buffer eight outstanding requests simultaneously. The
82450KX controller permits 1- or 2-way interleaving, and up to 256 Mbyte of memory when 16-Mbit DRAMs
are used. The 82450GX chip set is more aggressive, allowing up to four separate (complex-interleaved) memory
controllers,  each  of  which  can  be  up  to  4-way  interleaved  and  have  up  to  1  Gbyte  of  memory  (again  with
16 Mbit DRAMs).
