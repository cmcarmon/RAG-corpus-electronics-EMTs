As was noted in the discussion of Eq. (36.3), to achieve higher recording densities requires media with higher
coercivity. The coercivity of a particle is determined by the Ô¨Åeld required to cause the magnetization to switch
by 180(cid:176). If the magnetization remained in a single-domain state during the switching process, then the coercivity
should be given by
