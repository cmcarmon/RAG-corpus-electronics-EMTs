When the output capacitance decreases, the instantaneous frequency of the oscillator tank circuit
increases (acts the same as if C1 were decreased). When the output capacitance increases, the
instantaneous frequency of the oscillator tank circuit decreases. This decrease in frequency produces a
lower frequency in the output because of the shunting effect of CCE. Thus, the frequency of the oscillator
tank circuit increases and decreases at an audio frequency (af) modulating rate. The output of the
oscillator, therefore, is a frequency modulated rf signal.
