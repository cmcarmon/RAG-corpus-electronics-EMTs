STARTING RESISTORS are necessary since the dc resistance of a motor armature is very low. 
Excessive current will flow when dc voltage is first applied unless current is limited in some way. Adding 
resistance in series with the armature windings reduces initial current. It may then be removed after 
counter emf has been built up.
