The CCS7 network in Fig. 72.13 contains both local STPs and regional STPs. The STPs are typically deployed
in geographically separated pairs so that in the event of a natural disaster at one site, such as an earthquake,
ﬂood, or ﬁre, the total trafﬁc volume can be handled by the second site. Indeed, redundancy is provided at all
key points so that no single failure can isolate a node.
