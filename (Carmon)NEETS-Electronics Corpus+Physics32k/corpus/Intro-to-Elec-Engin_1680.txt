Figure 16.3.4(a) shows the block diagram of a simpliÔ¨Åed single-axis (pitch, yaw, or roll) autopilot
control system with digital data. The objective of the control is to make the position of the airframe
follow the command signal. The rate loop included here helps to improve system stability. Figure
16.3.4(b) illustrates a digital autopilot control system in which the position and rate information
are obtained by digital transducers. Sample-and-hold devices are shown on the block diagram.
While a sampler essentially samples an analog signal at some uniform sampling period, the hold
