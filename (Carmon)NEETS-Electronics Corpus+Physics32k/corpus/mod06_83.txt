Tungsten has great durability but requires large amounts of power for efficient thermionic emission.
Thoriated-tungsten filaments are made of tungsten with a very thin coat of thorium, which makes a much
better emitter of electrons than just tungsten. Oxide-coated filaments are made of metal, such as nickel,
coated with a mixture of barium and strontium oxides. The oxide coat, in turn, is coated with a one-
molecule-thick layer of metal barium and strontium. Oxide coating produces great emission efficiency
and long life at relatively low heat.
