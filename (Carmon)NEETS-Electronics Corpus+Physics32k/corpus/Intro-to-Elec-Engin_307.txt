3.1.1 (a) The concept of duality can be extended to
nonelectric physical systems by means of ana-
logs. For example, the mechanical system
characteristics can be investigated by means
of an equivalent electrical network. Consider
Newton’s second law, Hooke’s law as applied
to springs, and viscous friction law, and ﬁnd
the force–current analog as well as the force–
voltage analog by identifying the analogous
mathematical relations.
