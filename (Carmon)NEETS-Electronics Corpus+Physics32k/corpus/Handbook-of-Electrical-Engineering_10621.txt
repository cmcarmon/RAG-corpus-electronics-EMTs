Lighting Controls
In order to save energy, it is essential that minimum acceptable lighting levels be used during off-hours, cleaning
periods, and for other nonpeak periods as is practical. The ultimate system of control would be to remotely
control every Ô¨Åxture and to program the mode of operation, but this is hardly possible. Solid-state dimmers
are available, or ballasts can be circuited in separate groupings. Solid-state controls are available for dimming
entire areas of ballasted lights, but special ballasts are required and the controls could be expensive.
