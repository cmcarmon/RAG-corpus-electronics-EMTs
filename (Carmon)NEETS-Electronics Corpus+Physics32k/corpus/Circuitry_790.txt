Thermal analysis 
 
Many SPICE packages will allow you to determine 
the effects of temperature on the performance of a 
circuit.  Most  analyses  are  performed  at  normal 
ambient  temperatures  (e.g.  27Â°C)  but  it  can  be 
advantageous  to  look  at  the  effects  of  reduced  or 
increased 
the 
circuit  is  to  be  used  in  an  environment  in  which 
there is a considerable variation in temperature.
