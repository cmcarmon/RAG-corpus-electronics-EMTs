Several general characteristics are common to most lasers that new users may not expect. Like most other
light sources, lasers are inefﬁcient in converting input energy into light. Efﬁciencies range from less than 0.001
to  more  than  50%,  but  except  for  semiconductor  lasers,  few  types  are  much  above  1%  efﬁcient.  These  low
efﬁciencies  can  lead  to  special  cooling  requirements  and  duty-cycle  limitations,  particularly  for  high-power
lasers.  In  some  cases,  special  equipment  may  be  needed  to  produce  the  right  conditions  for  laser  operation,
such as cryogenic temperatures for lead salt semiconductor lasers. Operating characteristics of individual lasers
depend strongly on structural components such as cavity optics, and in many cases a wide range is possible.
Packaging can also have a strong impact on laser characteristics and the use of lasers for certain applications.
Thus, there are wide ranges of possible characteristics, although single devices will have much more limited
ranges of operation.
