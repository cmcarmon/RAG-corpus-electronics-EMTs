The relaxation time, τ(E), depends on how the electrons interact with the lattice vibrations, as well as with
extrinsic  elements  such  as  charged  impurities  and  defects.  For  example,  acoustical-mode  lattice  vibrations
scatter electrons through the deformation potential (τ
pe); optical-mode vibra-
tions through the polar potential (τ
po); ionized impurities and defects through the screened coulomb potential
