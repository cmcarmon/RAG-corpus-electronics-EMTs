If there is a dynamic coefficient of friction between two objects of 0.20, and vibration causes them to be in contact only half of the time, that would be equivalent to a constant coefficient of friction of 0.10. This substantial reduction in friction can have a profound effect on the system. According to anecdote, World War II Panzer tank treads may have been lubricated by their own squeak providing a serendipitous example of acoustic lubrication.
Another example occurs during landslides. Most landslides do not involve this effect, but occasionally the frequency of vibrations caused by the landslide is optimal to cause the boulders to vibrate. In this case, feedback causes the boulders to slide much farther and more quickly than typical, which can pose an increased danger to those in their path. One notable feature of such a landslide is that it appears to resemble flowing water, or mud, and not the dry sliding rocks that they were seconds earlier.
