Figure 14.16 gives a block diagram realizing the ﬁlter’s difference equation. This structure is referred to as
the direct-form I realization. Notice that this block diagram can be separated into two parts, giving two cascaded
networks, one of which realizes the ﬁlter zeros and the other the ﬁlter poles. The order of these networks can
be reversed without changing the transfer function. This results in a structure where the two strings of delays
are storing the same values, so a single string of delays of length max(M, N) is sufﬁcient, as shown in Fig. 14.17.
The realization of Fig. 14.17 requires the minimum number of z  –1 delay operations and is referred to as the
direct-form II realization.
