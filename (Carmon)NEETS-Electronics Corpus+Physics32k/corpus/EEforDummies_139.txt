Solderless breadboards enable you to test a circuit easily by swapping com-
ponents in and out. The not‐so‐nice thing about them is that it is easy to 
make a mistake. Common mistakes include plugging both leads of a compo-
nent into holes in the same row (that is, creating an unintended connection) 
and plugging a lead into a hole in the row next to the row you want (that is, 
leaving an intended connection unconnected).
