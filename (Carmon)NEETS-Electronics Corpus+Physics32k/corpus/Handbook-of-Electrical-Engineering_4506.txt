The Role of Approximation
As approximation is an intrinsic part of each step involved in developing a computer model, we summarize
some  of  the  more  commonly  used  approximations  in  Table  45.4.  We  note  that  the  distinction  between  an
approximation at the conceptualization step and during the formulation is somewhat arbitrary, but choose to
use the former category for those approximations that occur before the formulation itself.
