this field is so weak that its effect can be neglected. In atoms, electron orbital and spin dynamics are coupled because of the electric field of nuclei as it follows from the Dirac equation. This coupling, known as spin-orbit interaction, is small in the fine-structure constant

, and this product is of the order of unity already in the middle of the periodic table. This enhancement of the coupling between the orbital and spin dynamics originates from strong electric fields and electron velocities near nuclei. While this mechanism is also expected to couple electron spin to ac electric fields, such an effect has been probably never observed in atomic spectroscopy.
