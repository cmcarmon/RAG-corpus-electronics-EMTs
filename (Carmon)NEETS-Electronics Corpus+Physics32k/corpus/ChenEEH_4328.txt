To discuss the multiplication of two matrices A and B over
the same ﬁeld F represented by AB, one is restricted to choose
matrices where the number of columns of A equal the number
of rows of B. Such matrices are said to be conformable. The
resultant matrix, C ¼ AB, has its number of rows equal to the
number of rows of A and its number of columns equal to
the number of columns of B. Hence:
