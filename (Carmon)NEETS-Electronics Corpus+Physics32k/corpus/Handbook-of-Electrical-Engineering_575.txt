Notice that a dc term Y0 is present in the output (produced by the even-powered terms) which results in a shift
of the operating point of the circuit due to distortion. In addition, depending on the sign of  a3 there can be
an expansion or compression of the fundamental component. The harmonic distortion factors (assuming Y1 =
a1X1) are
