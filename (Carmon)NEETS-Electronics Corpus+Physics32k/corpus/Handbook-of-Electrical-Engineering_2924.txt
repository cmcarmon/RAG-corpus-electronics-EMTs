Most operational ampliﬁer circuits can be analyzed, at least for ﬁrst-order calculations, by considering the
op amp to be an “ideal” device. For more quantitative information, however, and particularly when frequency
response and dc offsets are important, one must refer to a more “practical” model that includes the internal
limitations of the device. If the op amp is characterized by a really complete model, the resulting circuit may
be quite complex, leading to rather laborious calculations. Fortunately, however, computer analysis using the
signiﬁcantly reduces the problem to one of a simple input speciﬁcation to the computer. Today,
program 
nearly all the op amp manufacturers provide SPICE models for their line of devices, with excellent correlation
obtained between the computer simulation and the actual measured results.
