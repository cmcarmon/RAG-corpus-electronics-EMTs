Before two FPNs can be added or subtracted in a computer, the E ﬁelds must be compared and equalized
and  the  F  ﬁelds  adjusted.  The  decision-making  process  can  be  simpliﬁed  if  all  exponents  are  converted  to
positive numbers by using the excess representation given by Eq. (86.15). For a q-digit number in radix r, the
exponent in Eq. (86.16) becomes
