This type of encoder is used to translate the dec-
imal input from a keyboard to an 8421 BCD code. 
The decimal-to-binary encoder and the decimal-to-
binary priority encoder are found wherever there is 
keyboard input, including in calculators, cell phones, 
computer keyboard inputs, electronic typewriters, 
telephones, and teletypewriters (TTY).
