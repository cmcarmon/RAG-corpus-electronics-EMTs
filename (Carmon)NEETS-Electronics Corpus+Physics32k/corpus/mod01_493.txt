A SERIES CIRCUIT is defined as a circuit that contains only ONE PATH for current flow. To
compare the basic circuit that has been discussed and a more complex series circuit, figure 3-13 shows
two circuits. The basic circuit has only one lamp and the series circuit has three lamps connected in series.
