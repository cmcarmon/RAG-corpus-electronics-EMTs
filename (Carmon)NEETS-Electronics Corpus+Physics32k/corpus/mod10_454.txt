You learned earlier that the maximum (and most efficient) transfer of electrical energy takes place
when the source impedance is matched to the load impedance. This fact is very important in the study of
transmission lines and antennas. If the characteristic impedance of the transmission line and the load
impedance are equal, energy from the transmitter will travel down the transmission line to the antenna
with no power loss caused by reflection.
