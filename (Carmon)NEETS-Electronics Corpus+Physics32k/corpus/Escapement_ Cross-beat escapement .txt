Jost BÃ¼rgi invented the cross-beat escapement in 1584, a variation of the verge escapement which had two foliots which rotated in opposite directions. According to contemporary accounts, his clocks achieved remarkable accuracy of within a minute per day, two orders of magnitude better than other clocks of the time. However, this improvement was probably not due to the escapement itself, but rather to better workmanship and his invention of the remontoire, a device which isolated the escapement from changes in drive force. Without a balance spring, the crossbeat would have been no more isochronous than the verge.
