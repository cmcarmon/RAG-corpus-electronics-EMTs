This object of interest is embedded in a homogeneous
background with dielectric constant erb. When an incident
Y
Ei(Yr)
time-harmonic electromagnetic wave with electric ﬁeld
and angular frequency v impinges on the object, one can
Y
Es(Yr) outside it. The purpose of
measure the scattered ﬁeld
inverse scattering is to reconstruct the shape of the object (for a
conductor) or the dielectric constant distribution er (Yr) of the
object (for a dielectric) based on the measured scattered ﬁeld.
