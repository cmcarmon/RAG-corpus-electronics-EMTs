When you turn on a light in your home, youâ€™re connecting a source of elec-
trical energy (usually supplied by your power company) to a light bulb in a 
complete path, known as an electrical circuit. If you add a dimmer or a timer 
to the light bulb circuit, you can control the operation of the light bulb in a 
more interesting way than just manually switching it on and off.
