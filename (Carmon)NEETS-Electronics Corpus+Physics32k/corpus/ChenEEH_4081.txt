. Intersymbol interference: The channel is always band-
limited. A band-limited channel spreads a pulse wave-
form passing through it. When the channel bandwidth is
much greater than pulse bandwidth, the spreading of the
pulse will be slight. When the channel bandwidth is close
to the signal bandwidth, the spreading will exceed a
