Let's analyze what is happening. The right-hand side of capacitor C1 is becoming increasingly 
negative. If the base of Q2 becomes sufficiently negative, Q2 will conduct. After a certain period of time, 
the base of Q2 will become sufficiently negative to cause Q2 to change states from cutoff to conduction. 
The time necessary for Q2 to become saturated is determined by the time constant R2C1.
