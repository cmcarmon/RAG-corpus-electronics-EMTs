If the mass distribution is continuous with the density ρ(r) within a solid Q, then the integral of the weighted position coordinates of the points in this volume relative to the center of mass R over the volume V is zero, that is

{\displaystyle \iiint \limits _{Q}\rho (\mathbf {r} )(\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {R} )dV=0.}

Solve this equation for the coordinates R to obtain

{\displaystyle \mathbf {R} ={\frac {1}{M}}\iiint \limits _{Q}\rho (\mathbf {r} )\mathbf {r} dV,}

where M is the total mass in the volume.
If a continuous mass distribution has uniform density, which means ρ is constant, then the center of mass is the same as the centroid of the volume.
