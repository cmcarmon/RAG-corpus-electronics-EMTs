electrical	properties	are	dependent	on	the	circuit	type,	as	well	as	on	their
conduction	bands	(i.e.	their	allowed	electric	power).	For	instance,	if	a	particular
power	source	chooses	to	distribute	a	9-volt	electric	power	to	a	closed	circuit,	its
electrical	properties	can	be	evaluated	by	using	2	details:	(1)	its	characteristic	as	a
closed	circuit	and	(2)	9-volt	electric	power.
Moreover,	conductors,	insulators,	and	semi-conductors	are	integral	concepts	to	the
conductivity	of	an	object.	While	conductors	and	semi-conductors	are	grouped	to
describe	charged	carriers,	insulators	are	still	considered	as	relative	despite	not
containing	any	free	charge.
