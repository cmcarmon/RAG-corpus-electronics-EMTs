. The weak inversion current (also known as subthreshold
current) is carried through the channel when the gate
voltage is below threshold, and it ï¬‚ows between the source
and drain of a MOS transistor. It increases exponentially
with the reduction of the device threshold voltage, making
it critical for low-voltage, low-power circuit design.
