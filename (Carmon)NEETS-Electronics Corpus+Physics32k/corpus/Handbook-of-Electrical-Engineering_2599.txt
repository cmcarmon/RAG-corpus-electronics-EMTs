As there is no lateral Ô¨Åeld to move the channel carriers, they move by diffusion only, driven by a gradient
in carrier density set up because the drain is effective in reducing the carrier density at the drain end of the
channel.  In  subthreshold  the  current  is  then  independent  of  drain  bias  once  this  bias  exceeds  a  few  tens  of
millivolts, enough to reduce the carrier density at the drain end of the channel to near zero.
