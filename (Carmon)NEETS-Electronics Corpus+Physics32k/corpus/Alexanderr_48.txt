1. Carefully  deÔ¨Åne the  problem. This  is  only  a  simple  example,  but
we can already see that we do not know the polarity on the 3-V source.
We  have  the  following  options.  We  can  ask  the  professor  what  the
polarity should be. If we cannot ask, then we need to make a decision
on  what  to  do  next.  If  we  have  time  to  work  the  problem  both  ways,
we  can  solve  for  the  current  when  the  3-V source  is  plus  on  top  and
then  plus  on  the  bottom.  If  we  do  not  have  the  time  to  work  it  both
ways,  assume  a  polarity  and  then  carefully  document  your  decision.
Let us assume that the professor tells us that the source is plus on the
bottom as shown in Fig. 1.20.
