was a variation in plate current of 7.5 milliamperes. Instead of amplification, De Forest had obtained
"conversion," or in other words, converted a signal voltage to a current variation. This wasn’t exactly what
he had in mind. As it stood, the circuit wasn’t very useful. Obviously, something was needed. After
examining the circuit, De Forest discovered the answer—Ohm's law. Remember E = I × R? De Forest
wanted a voltage change, not a current change. The answer was simple:
