Pioneering work in using motion to describe video object
activity has been presented by Dimitrova and Golshani (1995)
in their use of macroblock tracing and clustering to derive
trajectories and their computation of similarity between these
raw trajectories. In Dimitrova and Golshani (1994), a three-
level motion analysis methodology has been proposed. Starting
from extracting the trajectory of a macroblock in an MPEG
video, followed by averaging all trajectories of the macroblocks
of objects, and Ô¨Ånally estimating the relative position and
timing information among objects, a dual hierarchy of spatio-
temporal
logic is established for representing video. More
recently, Schonfeld and Lelescu (2000) developed a video
tracking and retrieval system know as VORTEX. In this system,
