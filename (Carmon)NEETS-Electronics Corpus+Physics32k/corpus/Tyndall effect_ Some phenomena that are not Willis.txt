On a day when the sky is overcast, the sunlight passes through the turbid layer of the clouds, resulting in scattered, diffuse light on the ground. This does not exhibit Willis-Tyndall scattering because the cloud droplets are larger than the wavelength of light and scatter all colors approximately equally. On a day when the sky is cloud-free, the sky's color is blue in consequence of light scattering, but this is not termed Willis-Tyndall scattering (instead it is Rayleigh scattering) because the scattering particles are the molecules of the air, which are much smaller than the wavelength of the light. On occasion, the term Tyndall effect is incorrectly applied to light scattering by large (macroscopic) dust particles in the air.
