Additional  circuitry  includes  support  for  the  microprocessor,  timers,  the  telemetry  interface,  low-voltage
power supplies, the high-voltage system, the pacing control, the deﬁbrillation control, and isolation and external
protection circuits. The telemetry interface is the link to the external programmer and consists of a coil, which
serves as the antenna, support circuitry, and a magnetic reed activator switch. The low-voltage supplies power
the  analog  and  digital  circuitry  as  well  as  the  pacing  pulses.  The  deﬁbrillation  control  determines  when
deﬁbrillation is necessary and controls the process of deﬁbrillation. The high-voltage system is used to generate
the deﬁbrillation shocks and consists of high-current batteries, capacitors, a ﬂy-back transformer, and output
switching  circuits.  The  pacing  control  includes  the  circuitry  to  deliver  pacing  pulses,  to  interpret  the  signals
from  the  sense  ampliﬁers,  and  timers  that  monitor  the  current  heart  rate  and  wake  the  microprocessor  if
necessary. The isolation and protection circuits provide protection against external deﬁbrillation attempts and
external noise.
