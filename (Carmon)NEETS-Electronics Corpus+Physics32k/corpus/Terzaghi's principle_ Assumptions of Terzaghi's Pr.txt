The soil is homogenous (uniform in composition throughout) and isotropic(show same physical property in each direction).
The soil is fully saturated (zero air voids due to water content being so high).
The solid particles and water are incompressible.
Compression and flow are one-dimensional (vertical axis being the one of interest).
Strains in the soil are relatively small.
Darcy's Law is valid for all hydraulic gradients.
The coefficient of permeability and the coefficient of volume compressibility remain constant throughout the process.
There is a unique relationship, independent of time, between the void ratio and effective stress
