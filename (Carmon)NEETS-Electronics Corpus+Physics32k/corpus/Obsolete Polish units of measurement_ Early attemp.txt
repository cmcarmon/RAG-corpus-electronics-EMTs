While this system introduced some level of standardisation throughout the country, the systems used in various voivodeships still differed from one another. To counter this problem already in 1507 Kraków ell and Poznań ell were made equal. The same applied to ells used in Lwów and Lublin, which however were different from the two mentioned before. In 1532 Płock ell joined the Kraków camp, which in 1565 was declared an official ell to be used in whole of the Crown of Poland. The system used by Warsaw was adopted in Płock and all of Masovia in 1569. In 1613 additional systems were created for Vilna and Kovno. The standardisation of other units of measurement also made some progress since the 15th century, but at a different pace. In the end this created even more confusion, as two towns could use the same units of length, but two different units of weight, although using the same terms.
