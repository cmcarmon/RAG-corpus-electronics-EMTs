function of the brightness. The JND is the amount of additional brightness needed to distinguish a patch from
the background. It is a visibility threshold. What is signiÔ¨Åcant is that the JND is dependent on the background
and surrounding luminances, the size of the background and surrounding areas, and the size of the patch, with
the primary dependence being on the luminance of the background.
