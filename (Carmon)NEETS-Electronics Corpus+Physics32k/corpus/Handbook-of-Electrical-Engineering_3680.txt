For samples made of single-domain particles, the maximum coercivity for three ferromagnetic metals and
one  ferrimagnetic  oxide  (widely  used  in  magnetic  recording)  is  calculated  using  the  preceding  formula.
Table 36.5 shows maximum coercivity (Oe) for single-domain particles (coherent rotation).
