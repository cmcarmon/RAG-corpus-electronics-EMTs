To help ensure that the former failure is less likely than the latter, engineers try to design
appliances in such a way as to minimize hot conductor contact with the case. Ideally, of course,
you don’t want either wire accidently coming in contact with the conductive case of the appli-
ance, but there are usually ways to design the layout of the parts to make accidental contact
less likely for one wire than for the other. However, this preventative measure is effective only
if power plug polarity can be guaranteed. If the plug can be reversed, then the conductor more
likely to contact the case might very well be the ”hot” one:
