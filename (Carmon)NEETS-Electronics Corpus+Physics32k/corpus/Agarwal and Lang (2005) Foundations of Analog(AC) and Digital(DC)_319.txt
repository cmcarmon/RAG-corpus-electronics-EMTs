By comparing Equation 2.55 to Equation 1.4, we conclude that for two
resistors in series, the equivalent resistance of the pair when viewed from their
outer terminals is the sum of the individual resistance values. Specifically,
if
RS is the resistance of the series resistor pair, then, from Equation 2.55, we
find that
