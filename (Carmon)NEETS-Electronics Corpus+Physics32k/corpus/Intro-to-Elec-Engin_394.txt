2. Since an ampliﬁer delivers electric power (to a speaker, for example), the output current
can be represented by its Thévenin-source model. The Thévenin resistance Ro is known as
the output resistance and the Thévenin voltage is a dependent voltage source Avin, where
A is called the open-circuit voltage ampliﬁcation.
