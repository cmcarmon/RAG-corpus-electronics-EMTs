The future is likely to see an increase in data rates as ﬁber-optic cables are widely deployed. This will spur the
development  of  faster  switching  nodes  through  the  use  of  parallel  processing  and  VLSI  implementation.
Protocols will have to be simpliﬁed to increase processor throughput. New forms of trafﬁc such as video and
graphics  will  become  more  important.  Computer  networks  will  proliferate  throughout  the  world,  making
possible the ubiquitous transport of data between any two points. These networks are likely to consist of both
private networks and new service offerings from telecommunications companies.
