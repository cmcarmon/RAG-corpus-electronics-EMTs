The primary function of a height-finding radar (sometimes referred to as a three-coordinate or 3D
radar) is that of computing accurate ranges, bearings, and altitudes of aircraft targets detected by air-
search radars. Height-finding radar is also used by the shipâ€™s air controllers to direct CAP aircraft during
interception of air targets. Modern 3D radar is often used as the primary air-search radar (figure 1-27).
This is because of its high accuracy and because the maximum ranges are only slightly less than those
available from 2D radar.
