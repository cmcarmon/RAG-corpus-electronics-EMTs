Depending on the gas flow characteristics in the system there are two states that can be matter of simulation:
Steady state - the simulation does not take into account the gas flow characteristics' variations over time and described by the system of algebraic equations, in general nonlinear ones.
Unsteady state (transient flow analysis) - described either by a partial differential equation or a system of such equations. Gas flow characteristics are mainly functions of time.
