We used the lumped circuit abstraction to represent the circuit pictured in
Figure 1.4a by the schematic diagram of Figure 1.4b. We stated that it was
permissible to ignore the physical extent and topology of the wires connecting
the elements and define voltages and currents for the elements provided they
met the lumped matter discipline.
