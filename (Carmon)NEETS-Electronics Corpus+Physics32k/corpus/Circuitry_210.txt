where f2 and f1 are respectively the upper and lower 
cut-off (or half-power) frequencies (in Hertz), f0 is 
the  resonant  frequency  (in  Hertz),  and  Q is  the  
Q-factor. 
 
Example 4.13 
 
A parallel  Lâ€“C  circuit  is  to  be  resonant  at  a 
frequency  of  400  Hz.  If  a  100  mH  inductor  is 
available,  determine 
the  value  of  capacitance 
required. 
 
Solution
