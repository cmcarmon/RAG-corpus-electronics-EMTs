from  a  repertoire  of  previously  learned  control  movements.  They  are  conditioned  responses  which  may  be
triggered by the situation and the command and control quantities, but they are not continuously dependent
.  Like  the
on  these  quantities.  This  pure  open-loop  programmed-control-like  behavior  is  called 
pursuit pathway, it often appears in company with compensatory follow-up or simultaneous operations. This
forms a dual-mode form of control in which the human’s manual output is initially dominated by the precognitive
action, which does most of the job, and is then completed when needed by compensatory error-reduction actions.
The  above  description  of  human  action  pathways  available  in  man-machine  systems  has  emphasized  the
visual modality. Similar behavior patterns can be exhibited to some extent in other modalities as well. Thus
the human’s interactions with machines can be even more extraordinarily varied than described here and can
range completely over the spectrum from open-loop to closed-loop in character in one or more modalities.
