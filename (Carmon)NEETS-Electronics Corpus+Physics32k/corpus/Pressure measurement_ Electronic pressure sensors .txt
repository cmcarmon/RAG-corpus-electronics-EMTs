Piezoresistive Strain Gage
Uses the piezoresistive effect of bonded or formed strain gauges to detect strain due to applied pressure.
Capacitive
Uses a diaphragm and pressure cavity to create a variable capacitor to detect strain due to applied pressure.
Magnetic
Measures the displacement of a diaphragm by means of changes in inductance (reluctance), LVDT, Hall effect, or by eddy current principle.
Piezoelectric
Uses the piezoelectric effect in certain materials such as quartz to measure the strain upon the sensing mechanism due to pressure.
Optical
Uses the physical change of an optical fiber to detect strain due to applied pressure.
Potentiometric
Uses the motion of a wiper along a resistive mechanism to detect the strain caused by applied pressure.
Resonant
Uses the changes in resonant frequency in a sensing mechanism to measure stress, or changes in gas density, caused by applied pressure.
