To test the tube for GAS, press the number 3 button and read the number 3 meter scale. The number
2 button also goes down when number 3 is pressed. If a dual tube having two identical sections is being
tested, the neon lamp (DS203) will light, indicating that both sections of the tube may be tested with one
card. To do this, check the tube for shorts, leakage, quality, and gas as described previously; then hold
down button number 4 and repeat these tests to test the second section of the tube. Dual tubes with
sections that are not identical require two cards for testing. A second card is also provided to make special
tests on certain tubes.
