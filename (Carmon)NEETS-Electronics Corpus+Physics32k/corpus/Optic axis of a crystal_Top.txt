An optic axis of a crystal is a direction in which a ray of transmitted light suffers no birefringence (double refraction). An optical axis is a direction rather than a single line: all rays that are parallel to that direction exhibit the same lack of birefringence.
Crystals may have a single optic axis, in which case they are uniaxial, or two different optic axes, in which case they are biaxial. Non-crystalline materials generally have no birefringence and thus, no optic axis. A uniaxial crystal (e.g. calcite, quartz) is isotropic within the plane orthogonal to the optic axis of the crystal.
