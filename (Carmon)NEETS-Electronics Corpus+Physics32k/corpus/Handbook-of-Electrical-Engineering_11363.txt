A possible detection scheme is illustrated in Fig. 116.1(B). The detector arrays shown can be made energy
selective to eliminate lower energy scattered gamma rays. While the distribution of radioactivity can be recon-
structed using the reconstruction from projection techniques described in the section on CT [Hurculak, 1987],
