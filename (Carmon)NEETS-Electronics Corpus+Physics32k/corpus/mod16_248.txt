TUNED CIRCUITS are used as filters for the passage or rejection of specific frequencies.
BANDPASS FILTERS and BAND-REJECT FILTERS are examples of this type. Tuned circuits have
certain characteristics that make them ideal for certain types of filters, especially where a high degree of
selectivity is desired. A series-tuned circuit offers a low impedance to currents of the particular frequency
to which the circuit is tuned and a relatively high impedance to currents of all other frequencies. A
parallel-tuned circuit, on the other hand, offers a very high impedance to currents of its natural, or
resonant, frequency and a relatively low impedance to others. If you feel you need to review the subject of
tuned circuits at this time, refer to NEETS, Module 9, Introduction to Wave-Generation and Wave-
Shaping Circuits, for more information on these circuits and their applications.
