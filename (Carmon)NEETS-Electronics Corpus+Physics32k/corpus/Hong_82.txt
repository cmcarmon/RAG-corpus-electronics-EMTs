The structure of an NPN BJT, shown in Figure ###, consists of three layers of 
materials:  an  N-type  layer,  a  thin  P-type  layer,  and  another  N-type  layer,  which 
corresponds to the emitter, base, and collector. The emitter-base and collector-base PN-
junction  form  diodes  with  opposing  directions  of  conduction  as  shown  in  Figure  7.3. 
Typically, the collector is connected to a higher voltage than the emitter, while the base is 
connected to a voltage between the two. The collector-to-emitter voltage is equivalent to 
the height of the water in the dam model. The base voltage is equivalent to the position of 
the control gate. When the voltage at the base is not enough to turn-on the base-emitter 
diode, there is no conduction from collector to emitter. When the voltage at the base is 
high enough to turn-on the base-emitter diode, a conduction path from collector to emitter 
is opened.
