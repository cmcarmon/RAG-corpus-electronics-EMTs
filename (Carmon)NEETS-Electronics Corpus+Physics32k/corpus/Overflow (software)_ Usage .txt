Scientists use OVERFLOW to better understand the aerodynamic forces on a vehicle by evaluating the flowfield surrounding the vehicle. While wind tunnel testing provides limited data at many flow conditions, CFD simulations provide detailed information about selected conditions, and also provide a distribution of forces on the vehicle, aiding in structural design.
OVERFLOW has also been used to simulate the effect of debris on the space shuttle launch vehicle.
