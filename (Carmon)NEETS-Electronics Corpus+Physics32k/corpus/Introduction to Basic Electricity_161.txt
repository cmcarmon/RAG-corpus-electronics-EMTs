Treat	each	electrical	device	as	if	live	current	is	running	inside	it	(regardless
if	you’re	aware	that	there	isn’t)
Overloading	sockets	for	a	circuit	board?	Not	a	good	idea
To	cut	off	running	current,	add	a	residual	current
Always	disconnect	(and	not	just	turn	off)	electrical	devices	when	working
on	a	component
Always	turn	off	any	electrical	device	if	not	in	use
Regularly	check	the	conditions	of	sockets	and	plugs
Practice	extreme	caution	when	dealing	with	liquids	and	electric	current
Make	sure	your	hands	are	dry
Avoid	octopus	connections	(i.e.	devices	that	enable	multiple	plugs	or
sockets)
Keep	electrical	wires	and	cords	tucked	neatly
Wear	the	proper	attire	when	creating	a	circuit;	put	on	non-conductive
gloves	and	footwear	with	insulated	soles
