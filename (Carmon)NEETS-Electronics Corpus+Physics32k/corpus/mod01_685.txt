Conditions aboard ship add to the chance of receiving an electrical shock. Aboard ship the body is
likely to be in contact with the metal structure of the ship and the body resistance may be low because of
perspiration or damp clothing. Extra care and awareness of electrical hazards aboard ship are needed.
