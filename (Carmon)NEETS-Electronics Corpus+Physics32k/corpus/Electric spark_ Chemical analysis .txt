The light that is produced by electric sparks can be collected and used for a type of spectroscopy called spark emission spectroscopy.
A high energy pulsed laser can be used to produce an electric spark. Laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is a type of atomic emission spectroscopy that uses a high pulse energy laser to excite atoms in a sample. LIBS has also been called laser spark spectroscopy (LSS).
Electric sparks can also be used to create ions for mass spectrometry.
