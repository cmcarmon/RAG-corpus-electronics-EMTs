When  you  build  circuit  boards  that  include 
 integrated  circuits,  use  an  IC  socket  instead 
of soldering the IC directly onto the board. You 
solder the socket onto the board, and then you 
plug in the IC and hit the switch.
IC sockets come in different shapes and sizes 
to match the integrated circuits they’re meant 
to work with. For example, if you have a 16‐pin 
integrated circuit, choose a 16‐pin socket.
Here are some good reasons for using sockets:
▶✓ Soldering  a  circuit  board  can  generate 
static.  By  soldering  to  the  socket  rather 
than to the actual IC, you can avoid ruining 
CMOS or other static‐sensitive ICs.
