Consider figure 2-1, views (A) through (D). View (A) is a radio frequency (rf) carrier which is
actually several thousand or million hertz. View (B) represents the intelligence to be transmitted as
MARKS and SPACES. Recall that in cw transmission, this intelligence was applied to the rf carrier by
interrupting the signal, as shown in view (C). The amplitude of the rf alternated between maximum and 0
volts. By comparing views (B) and (C), you can see the mark/space intelligence of the Morse code
character on the rf. The spacing of the waveform in view (D) is an example of the same intelligence as it
is applied to the frequency instead of the amplitude of the rf. This is simple frequency-shift keying of the
same Morse code character.
