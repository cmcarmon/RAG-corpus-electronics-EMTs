Lines  2  and  3  define  the  supply  voltages.  VCC  is  
+12 V and is connected between node 7 and node 0 
(signal  ground).  VEE  is  H12  V  and  is  connected 
between node 8 and node 0 (signal ground). Line 4 
defines  the  input  voltage  which  is  connected 
between node 1 and node 0 (ground) whilst lines 5 
and  6  define  1  kI resistors  (RS1  and  RS2) 
connected between 1 and 2, and 6 and 0. 
  Lines 7 and 8 are used to define the connections 
of two transistors (Q1 and Q2). The characteristics 
of  these  transistors  (both  identical)  are  defined  by 
MOD1 (see line 12). Lines 9, 10 and 11 define the 
connections  of  three  further  resistors  (RC1,  RC2 
and RE respectively). Line 12 defines the transistor 
model. The device is NPN and has a current gain of 
50.  The  corresponding  circuit  is  shown  in  Fig. 
17.15.  
  Most 
semiconductor  manufacturers  provide 
detailed  SPICE  models  for  the  devices  that  they 
produce. The following is a manufacturerâ€™s SPICE
