Regardless of the synchro to be zeroed, there are two major steps in each procedure. The first step is 
the coarse or approximate setting. The second step is the fine setting. The coarse setting ensures the 
device is zeroed on the 0ยบ position rather than the 180ยบ position. Many synchro units are marked in such a 
manner that the coarse setting may be approximated physically by aligning two marks on the synchro. On 
standard synchros, this setting is indicated by an arrow stamped on the frame and a line marked on the 
shaft, as shown in figure 1-37. The fine setting is where the synchro is precisely set on 0ยบ.
