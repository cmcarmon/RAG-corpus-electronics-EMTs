Circuit theory is an important and perhaps the oldest branch
of electrical engineering. A circuit is an interconnection of
electrical elements. These include passive elements, such as
resistances, capacitances, and inductances, as well as active
elements and sources (or excitations). Two variables, namely
voltage and current variables, are associated with each circuit
element. There are two aspects to circuit theory: analysis and
design. Circuit analysis involves the determination of current
and voltage values in different elements of the circuit, given the
values of the sources or excitations. On the other hand, circuit
design focuses on the design of circuits that exhibit a certain
prespeciÔ¨Åed voltage or current characteristics at one or more
