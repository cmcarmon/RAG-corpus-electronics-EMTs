To construct a theory of relative motion consistent with the theory of special relativity, we must adopt a different convention. Continuing to work in the (non-relativistic) Newtonian limit we begin with a Galilean transformation in one dimension:





x
′

=
x
−
v
t


{\displaystyle x'=x-vt}






t
′

=
t


{\displaystyle t'=t}

where x' is the position as seen by a reference frame that is moving at speed, v, in the "unprimed" (x) reference frame. Taking the differential of the first of the two equations above, we have,



d

x
′

=
d
x
−
v

d
t


{\displaystyle dx'=dx-v\,dt}
, and what may seem like the obvious statement that



d

t
′

=
d
t


{\displaystyle dt'=dt}
, we have:







d

x
′



d

t
′




=



d
x


d
t



−
v


{\displaystyle {\frac {dx'}{dt'}}={\frac {dx}{dt}}-v}

To recover the previous expressions for relative velocity, we assume that particle A is following the path defined by dx/dt in the unprimed reference (and hence dx′/dt′ in the primed frame). Thus



d
x

/

d
t
=

v

A
∣
O




{\displaystyle dx/dt=v_{A\mid O}}
and



d

x
′


/

d
t
=

v

A
∣

O
′





{\displaystyle dx'/dt=v_{A\mid O'}}
, where



O


{\displaystyle O}
and




O
′



{\displaystyle O'}
refer to motion of A as seen by an observer in the unprimed and primed frame, respectively. Recall that v is the motion of a stationary object in the primed frame, as seen from the unprimed frame. Thus we have



v
=

v


O
′

∣
O




{\displaystyle v=v_{O'\mid O}}
, and:





v

A
∣

O
′



=

v

A
∣
O


−

v


O
′

∣
O


⇒

v

A
∣
O


=

v

A
∣

O
′



+

v


O
′

∣
O


,


{\displaystyle v_{A\mid O'}=v_{A\mid O}-v_{O'\mid O}\Rightarrow v_{A\mid O}=v_{A\mid O'}+v_{O'\mid O},}

where the latter form has the desired (easily learned) symmetry.
