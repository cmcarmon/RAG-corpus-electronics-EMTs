In other channels, the noise can be modeled as being i.i.d. but with an amplitude distribution that is not
Gaussian.  This  type  of  model  arises,  for  example,  in  channels  dominated  by  impulsive  phenomena,  such  as
urban radio channels. In the non-Gaussian case the procedures discussed previously lose their optimality as
deﬁned in terms of the error probabilities. These procedures can still be used, and they will work well under
many conditions; however, there will be a resulting performance penalty with respect to optimum procedures
based  on  the  likelihood  ratio.  Generally  speaking,  likelihood-ratio-based  procedures  for  non-Gaussian  noise
channels  involve  more  complex  nonlinear  processing  of  the  measurements  than  is  required  in  the  standard
detectors, although the retention of the i.i.d. assumption greatly simpliﬁes this problem. A treatment of methods
for such channels can be found in Kassam [1988].
