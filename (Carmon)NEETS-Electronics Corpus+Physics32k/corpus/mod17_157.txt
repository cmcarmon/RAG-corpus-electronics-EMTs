Figure 2-3 gives you an idea of what the block diagram of a simple AM transmitter looks like. The
oscillator, buffer amplifier, and power amplifier serve the same purpose as those in the cw transmitter.
The microphone converts the audio frequency (af) input (a personâ€™s voice) into corresponding electrical
energy. The driver amplifies the audio, and the modulator further amplifies the audio signal to the
amplitude necessary to fully modulate the carrier. The output of the modulator is applied to the power
