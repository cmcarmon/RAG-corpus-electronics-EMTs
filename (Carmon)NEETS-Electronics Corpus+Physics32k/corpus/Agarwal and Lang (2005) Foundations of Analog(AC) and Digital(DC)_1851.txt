Analytical analysis based on the methods we learned in the previous chap-
ters would suggest writing the differential equation for the circuit comprising the
resistor RL and the capacitor CGS and finding the forced response to an applied
sinusoid. As demonstrated by the example in Section 10.6.7, this type of anal-
ysis is very cumbersome. In contrast, the analysis methods that we will learn
