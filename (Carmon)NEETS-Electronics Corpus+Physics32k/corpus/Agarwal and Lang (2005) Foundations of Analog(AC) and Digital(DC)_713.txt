As another example concerning logical 1’s, suppose that a receiver can
interpret voltages that are above 3 V as a logical 1. Further, suppose that
senders are restricted to sending voltages higher than 4.5 V for a logical 1.
Then, it takes at least 1.5 V of noise to force the sender’s voltage signal on the
wire into the forbidden region. We say that such a choice of voltage levels offers
a noise immunity of 1.5 volts for a logical 1.
