Standard fuses are sometimes used to protect against direct shorts only. They may be wired in series with
a delay fuse to provide faster direct short protection. For example, in a circuit with a 1-ampere delay fuse,
a 5-ampere standard fuse may be used in addition to the delay fuse to provide faster protection against a
direct short.
