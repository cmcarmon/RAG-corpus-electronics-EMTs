of the National Electrical Code (NEC). The pur-
pose of this code is to provide guidelines for safe wir-
ing practices in residential and commercial buildings. 
State and local municipalities may require even more 
stringent codes than the NEC that must be followed. 
In many states, all wiring must be done or approved 
by a master electrician. These codes are published for 
both your own and your neighborâ€™s protection. Elec-
trical fires can and do happen, and they can spread to 
adjacent homes or apartments. The rules in the NEC 
guidebook help to minimize electrical fires and to 
provide safety in electrical wiring.
