Note that (73.13) is a quadratic function of the measurements; thus, a detector based on the comparison of
this quantity to a threshold is known as a quadratic detector. The simplest form of this detector results from
the situation in which the signal samples are, like the noise samples, i.i.d. In this case, the quadratic function
(73.13) reduces to a positive constant multiple of the quantity
