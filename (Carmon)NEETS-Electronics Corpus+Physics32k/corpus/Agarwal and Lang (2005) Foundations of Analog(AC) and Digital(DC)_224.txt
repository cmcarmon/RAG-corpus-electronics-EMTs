where the integration is performed over one cycle.
The significance of the rms value of a periodic signal can be seen by com-
puting the average power Â¯p delivered to a resistance of value R by a periodic
voltage signal v(t) with period T. For periodic signals, the average power can
be obtained by integrating the power over one cycle and dividing by the cycle
time:
