The	circuit-level	optimization	or	power	optimization	of	EDA	tools	refers	to	the
various	techniques	that	are	employed	for	the	reduction	of	the	total	power	in	a
circuit.	Although	the	intent	is	to	modify	a	circuit’s	setup	economically,	the
processes	shouldn’t	compromise	the	product’s	overall	quality.	With	the	main	goal
of	enhancing	a	circuit’s	efficiency,	the	other	objectives	are	to	increase	speed,
eliminate	possible	leakage,	enhance	power	distribution,	and	improve	functionality.
