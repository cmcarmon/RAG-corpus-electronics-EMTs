FDDI speciﬁes three reliability requirements of providing an
automatic bypass for a bad or power-off station, using dual
rings for easy reconﬁguration when one ring is broken, and
installing a wiring concentrator. Table 6.4 summarizes the
comparison between IEEE 802.5 Token Passing Ring and
ANSI X3T9.5 FDDI.
