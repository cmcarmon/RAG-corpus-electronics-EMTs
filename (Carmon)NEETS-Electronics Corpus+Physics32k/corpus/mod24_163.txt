The principles behind the transfer of light along an optical fiber were discussed earlier in this
chapter. You learned that propagation of light depended on the nature of light and the structure of the
optical fiber. However, our discussion did not describe how optical fibers affect system performance. In
this case, system performance deals with signal loss and bandwidth.
