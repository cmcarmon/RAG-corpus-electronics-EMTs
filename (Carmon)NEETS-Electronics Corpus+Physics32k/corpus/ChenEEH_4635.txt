The closed-loop LPV system shown in Figure 9.2, denoted
F â€˜(P(u), K (u)),
is asymptotically stable and posesses the
appropriate performance attributes. Synthesis conditions for
induced-L2 and induced-L1 are presented. In both cases,
gain-scheduled controller synthesis is achieved by solving a
set of linear matrix inequalities.
