Step 6—Cleaning the PC. To restart the overall EP process, the PC must be cleaned of residual toner and
contaminants.  Fiber  brushes,  scraper  blades,  and “magnetic-brush”  cleaners  are  used.  For  low-end  printers,
scraper blades sufﬁce and are replaced (in some systems) with each new cartridge. Rotating soft-ﬁber brushes
with air ﬂow collection are used commonly in mid-range to high-end printers. Magnetic-brush cleaning is very
similar to magnetic-brush development (see above).
