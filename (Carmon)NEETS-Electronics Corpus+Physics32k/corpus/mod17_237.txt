You should remember that, depending on transistor types, the receiver may require either a positive
or a negative agc voltage. A negative agc voltage could be easily obtained by reversing CR1. Once the
values for R2 and C2 have been selected, the voltage divider action of the components is fixed, and the
circuit operates automatically without further adjustment. If the average amplitude of the signal increases,
the charge on C2 will also increase. If the signal amplitude decreases so does the charge on C2.
