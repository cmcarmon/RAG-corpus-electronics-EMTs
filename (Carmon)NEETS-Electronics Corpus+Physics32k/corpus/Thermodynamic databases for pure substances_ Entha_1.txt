When heat is added to a condensed-phase substance, its temperature increases until a phase change temperature is reached. With further addition of heat, the temperature remains constant while the phase transition takes place. The amount of substance that transforms is a function of the amount of heat added. After the transition is complete, adding more heat increases the temperature. In other words, the enthalpy of a substance changes isothermally as it undergoes a physical change. The enthalpy change resulting from a phase transition is designated ΔH. There are four types of enthalpy changes resulting from a phase transition. To wit:

Enthalpy of transformation. This applies to the transformations from one solid phase to another, such as the transformation from α-Fe (bcc ferrite) to



γ


{\displaystyle \gamma }
-Fe (fcc austenite). The transformation is designated ΔHtr.
Enthalpy of fusion or melting. This applies to the transition of a solid to a liquid and is designated ΔHm.
Enthalpy of vaporization. This applies to the transition of a liquid to a vapor and is designated ΔHv.
Enthalpy of sublimation. This applies to the transition of a solid to a vapor and is designated ΔHs.

Cp is infinite at phase transition temperatures because the enthalpy changes isothermally. At the Curie temperature, Cp shows a sharp discontinuity while the enthalpy has a change in slope.
Values of ΔH are usually given for the transition at the normal standard state temperature for the two states, and if so, are designated with a superscript °. ΔH for a phase transition is a weak function of temperature. In some texts, the heats of phase transitions are called latent heats (for example, latent heat of fusion).
