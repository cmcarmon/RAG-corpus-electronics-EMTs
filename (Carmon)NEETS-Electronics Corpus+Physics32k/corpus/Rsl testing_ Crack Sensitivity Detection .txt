Precision in controlling the load allows for greater sensitivity in measuring crack extension via load drop and compliance correlation than obtainable with high-voltage electrical resistivity measurements and eliminates the need for clip gages. This capability allows for precise electronic detection of the maximum load required for Crack Tip Opening Displacement calculations of Fracture Toughness and precise detection of the onset of crack growth required for measurement of the threshold stress for hydrogen embrittlement, environmental or stress corrosion cracking.
