Chances are, you interact with variable capacitors more than you would with 
a spouse. Variable capacitors are behind many touch‐sensitive devices, such 
as certain smartphone screens, computer keyboard keys, control panels on 
many appliances and in some elevators, and the buttons on your favorite 
remote control. One type of microphone uses a variable capacitor to convert 
sound into electrical signals, with the diaphragm of the mic acting as a mov-
able capacitor plate. Sound fluctuations make the diaphragm vibrate, which 
varies the capacitance, producing voltage fluctuations. This device is known 
as a condenser microphone, so‐named because capacitors used to be called 
condensers.
