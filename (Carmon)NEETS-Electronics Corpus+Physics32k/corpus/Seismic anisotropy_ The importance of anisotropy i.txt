In the past two decades, the seismic anisotropy has dramatically been gaining attention from academic and industry, due to advances in anisotropy parameter estimation, the transition from post stack imaging to pre stack depth migration, and the wider offset and azimuthal coverage of 3D surveys. Currently, many seismic processing and inversion methods utilize anisotropic models, thus providing a significant enhancement over the seismic imaging quality and resolution. The integration of anisotropy velocity model with seismic imaging has reduced uncertainty on internal and bounding-fault positions, thus greatly reduce the risk of investment decision based heavily on seismic interpretation.
In addition, the establishment of correlation between anisotropy parameter and fracture orientation and density lead to practical reservoir characterization techniques. The acquisition of such information, fracture`s spatial distribution and density, the drainage area of each producing well can be dramatically increased if take the fracture into account during drilling decision process. The increased drainage area per well will result in less number of well, therefore greatly reduce the drilling cost of exploration and production (E&P) projects.
