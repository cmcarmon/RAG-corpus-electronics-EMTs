DG technologies offer many possibilities for integrated operation. Integrated systems may be stand-alone with
energy storage and reconversion or include grid connection. Also, both renewable and conventional systems

can be integrated to achieve the required operational characteristics. Integrated renewable energy systems (
that harness several manifestations of solar energy to supply a variety of energy and other needs have many
advantages and applications worldwide. The complementary nature of some of the resources (insolation and
wind, for example) over the annual cycle can be exploited by IRES to decrease the amount of energy storage
necessary and lower the overall cost of energy.
