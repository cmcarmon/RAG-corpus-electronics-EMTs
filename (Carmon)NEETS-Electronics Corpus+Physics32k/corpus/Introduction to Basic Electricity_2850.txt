For example, if a transistor amplifier can efficiently 
drive a 100-ohm load, it will not efficiently drive a 
4-ohm speaker. A transformer used between the tran-
sistor amplifier and speaker can make the impedance 
of the speaker appear to be in proportion. This is ac-
complished by choosing the proper turns ratio.
