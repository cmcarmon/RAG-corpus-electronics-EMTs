The simple concept of relative phase relationships is exploited by engineers and scientists in
several systems that are beneﬁcial to the general public. For example, remote measurements of
the height of Greenland’s ice cap (by using high-quality GPS receivers) are being made to assess
the possible effects of global warming.
