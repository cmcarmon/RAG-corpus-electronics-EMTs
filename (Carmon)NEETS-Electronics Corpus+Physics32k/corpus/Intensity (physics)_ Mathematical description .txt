If a point source is radiating energy in all directions (producing a spherical wave), and no energy is absorbed or scattered by the medium, then the intensity decreases in proportion to distance from the object squared. This is an example of the inverse-square law.
Applying the law of conservation of energy, if the net power emanating is constant,




P
=
∫


I



⋅

d



A




{\displaystyle P=\int {\mathbf {I} }\,\cdot \mathrm {d} {\mathbf {A} }}
,
where P is the net power radiated, I is the intensity as a function of position, and dA is a differential element of a closed surface that contains the source.
If one integrates over a surface of uniform intensity I, for instance over a sphere centered around the point source, the equation becomes

{\displaystyle P=|I|\cdot A_{\mathrm {surf} }=|I|\cdot 4\pi r^{2}\,}
,
where I is the intensity at the surface of the sphere, and r is the radius of the sphere. (

.
If the medium is damped, then the intensity drops off more quickly than the above equation suggests.
Anything that can transmit energy can have an intensity associated with it. For a monochromatic propagating wave, such as a plane wave or a Gaussian beam, if E is the complex amplitude of the electric field, then the time-averaged energy density of the wave is given by:

E

{\displaystyle \left\langle U\right\rangle ={\frac {n^{2}\varepsilon _{0}}{2}}|E|^{2}}
,
and the local intensity is obtained by multiplying this expression by the wave velocity, c/n:




I

{\displaystyle I={\frac {\mathrm {c} n\varepsilon _{0}}{2}}|E|^{2}}
,
where n is the refractive index, c is the speed of light in vacuum and




ε

{\displaystyle \varepsilon _{0}}
is the vacuum permittivity.
For non-monochromatic waves, the intensity contributions of different spectral components can simply be added. The treatment above does not hold for arbitrary electromagnetic fields. For example, an evanescent wave may have a finite electrical amplitude while not transferring any power. The intensity should then be defined as the magnitude of the Poynting vector.
