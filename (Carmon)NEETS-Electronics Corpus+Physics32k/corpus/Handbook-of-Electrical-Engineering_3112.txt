Gate Turn-Off Thyristor (GTO)
The GTO is a power switching device that can be turned on by a short pulse of gate current and turned off by
a reverse gate pulse. This reverse gate current amplitude is dependent on the anode current to be turned off.
Hence  there  is  no  need  for  an  external  commutation  circuit  to  turn  it  off.  Because  turn-off  is  provided  by
bypassing carriers directly to the gate circuit, its turn-off time is short, thus giving it more capability for high-
frequency operation than thyristors. The GTO symbol and turn-off characteristics are shown in Fig. 30.3.
