formula for determining the area of a circle (A = pir2). In this formula, A (area) is the unknown and is 
equal to the cross-sectional area in square mils, pi is the constant 3.14, and r is the radius of the circle, or 
half the diameter (D). Through substitution, A = 3.14, and (12.5) 2; therefore, 3.14 Ã— 156.25 = 490.625
