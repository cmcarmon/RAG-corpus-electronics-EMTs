When a carrier is modulated by voice or music signals, a large number of sum and difference 
frequencies are produced. All of the sum frequencies above the carrier are spoken of collectively as the 
UPPER SIDEBAND. All the difference frequencies below the carrier, also considered as a group, are 
called the LOWER SIDEBAND.
