An automatic switch is a switch that is controlled by a mechanical or electrical device. You do not
have to turn an automatic switch on or off. Two examples of automatic switches are a thermostat and the
distributor in a motor vehicle. The thermostat will turn a furnace or air conditioner on or off by
responding to the temperature in a room. The distributor electrically turns on the spark plug circuit at the
proper time by responding to the mechanical rotation of a shaft. Even the switch that turns on the light in
a refrigerator when the door is opened is an automatic switch.
