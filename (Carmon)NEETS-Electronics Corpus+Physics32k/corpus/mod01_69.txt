Figure 1-1 shows one hydrogen and one helium atom. Each has a relatively simple structure. The
hydrogen atom has only one proton in the nucleus with one electron rotating about it. The helium atom is
a little more complex. It has a nucleus made up of two protons and two neutrons, with two electrons
rotating about the nucleus. Elements are classified numerically according to the complexity of their
atoms. The atomic number of an atom is determined by the number of protons in its nucleus.
