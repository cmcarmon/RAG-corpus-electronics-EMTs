Interaction
The power of computer graphics is to be able to input commands or data in a manner that is appropriate for
an application and to have the program react in a timely fashion. These interactions may involve typing words
or labels, pointing to items or commands, specifying values or directions for movement, or choosing picture
parts displayed on the screen.
