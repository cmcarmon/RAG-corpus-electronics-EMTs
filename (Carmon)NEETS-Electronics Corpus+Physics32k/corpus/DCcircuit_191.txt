So far, we’ve been analyzing single-battery, single-resistor circuits with no regard for the con-
necting wires between the components, so long as a complete circuit is formed. Does the wire
length or circuit ”shape” matter to our calculations? Let’s look at a couple of circuit conﬁgura-
tions and ﬁnd out:
