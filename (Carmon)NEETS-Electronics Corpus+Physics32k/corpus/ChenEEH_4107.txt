In this section, we study three modulation methods: min-
imum shift keying (MSK), Gaussian minimum shift keying
(GMSK), and p/4-differential quadrature phase shift key-
ing (p=4-DQPSK). GMSK is the modulation used by Glo-
bal System of Mobile communications (GSM), GSM-1800,
and GSM-1900, and Digital European Cordless Telephone
(DECT). MSK is introduced as a Ô¨Årst step toward GMSK.
