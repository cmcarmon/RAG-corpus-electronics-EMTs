Failure-to-Follow Distortion
When a properly designed peak detector circuit is used for AM demodulation the output follows the envelope
of the input signal whereby the original modulation signal is recovered. A simple peak detector is a diode in
series with a low-pass RC ﬁlter. The critical component of such a circuit is a linear element, the ﬁlter capacitance
C. If C is large, then the output fails to follow the envelope of the input signal, resulting in failure-to-follow
distortion.
