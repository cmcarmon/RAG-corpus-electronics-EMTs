Multiferroic properties can appear in a large variety of materials. Therefore, several conventional material fabrication routes are used, including solid state synthesis, hydrothermal synthesis, sol-gel processing, vacuum based deposition, and floating zone.
Some types of multiferroics require more specialized processing techniques, such as
Vacuum based deposition (for instance: MBE, PLD) for thin film deposition to exploit certain advantages that may come with 2-dimensional layered structures such as: strain mediated multiferroics, heterostructures, anisotropy.
High pressure solid state synthesis to stabilize metastable or highly distorted structures, or in the case of the Bi-based multiferroics due to the high volatility of bismuth.
