The IEEE Transactions on Power Systems is a reference for the most recent papers on voltage viability and
voltage  instability  problems.  The  Journal  of  Electric  Power  Systems  Research  and  Journal  on  Electric  Machines
and Power Systems also contain excellent papers on voltage instability.
