Operational amplifiers are used in so many different ways that it is not possible to describe all of the
applications. Entire books have been written on the subject of operational amplifiers. Some books are
devoted entirely to the applications of operational amplifiers and are not concerned with the theory of
operation or other circuits at all. This module, as introductory material on operational amplifiers, will
show you only two common applications of the operational amplifier: the summing amplifier and the
difference amplifier. For ease of explanation the circuits shown for these applications will be explained
with d.c. inputs and outputs, but the circuit will work as well with a.c. signals.
