a serial data port using a serial-parallel, parallel-serial shift register. (See internal register summary in Fig. 81.37)
Each line of the input/output ports, A and B, can be individually programmed as an input or an output by
means of data direction registers, DDRA and DDRB, respectively, which “mirror” the ports. That is, a bit in the
data  direction  register  set  at  1  causes  the  corresponding  bit  of  the  port  to  act  as  an  output,  with  a  value
determined  by  the  output  latch  setting.  If  the  bit  in  the  data  direction  register  is  set  at  0,  this  causes  the
corresponding bit of the port to act as an input, and incoming data may be latched into an internal register
under the control of a special peripheral control line, CA1 or CB1. Data may be written into register bits which
are programmed as inputs but the output signal is unaffected. The input latching may be enabled or disabled.
When reading a peripheral port with the latching disabled, the value read is the current value on the input pin;
with the latching enabled, the value read is the value which existed at the input pin when the active transition
occurred at the control input.
