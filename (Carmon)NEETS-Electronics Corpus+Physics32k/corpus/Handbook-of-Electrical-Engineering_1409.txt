several modiﬁcations of the pattern matching approach were proposed. Speciﬁcally, adapting the templets of
the clean signal to reﬂect the presence of the noise was proposed by Roe in 1987 [Ephraim, 1992]; choosing
templets for the noisy signal which are more robust than those obtained from adaptation of the templets for
the  clean  signal  was  often  proposed;  and  using  distance  measures  which  are  robust  to  noise,  such  as  the
projection measure proposed by Mansour and Juang in 1989 [Ephraim, 1992]. These approaches along with
the preﬁltering approach in the sampled signal case are fairly intuitive and are relatively easy to implement.
It  is  difﬁcult,  however,  to  establish  their  optimality  in  any  well-deﬁned  sense. Another  interesting  approach
based  on  robust  statistics  was  developed  by  Merhav  and  Lee  [Ephraim,  1992].  This  approach  was  shown
asymptotically  optimal  in  the  minimum  probability  of  error  sense  within  the  hidden  Markov  modeling
framework.
