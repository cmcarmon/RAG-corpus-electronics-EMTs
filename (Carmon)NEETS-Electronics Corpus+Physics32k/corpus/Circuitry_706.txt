The  potential  developed  across  the  forward 
biased  base-emitter  junction  of  a  silicon  transistor 
is  approximately  0.6  V.  In  the  case  of  an  NPN 
transistor, the base will be positive with respect to 
the  emitter  whilst,  for  a  PNP  transistor,  the  base 
will  be  negative  with  respect  to  the  emitter,  as 
shown in Fig. 15.2. The base-emitter voltage drop 
tends to be larger when the transistor is operated as 
a saturated switch (and is in the ‘on’ state) or when 
it is a power type carrying an appreciable collector 
current. In these applications, base-emitter voltages 
of  between  0.65  V  and  0.7  V  are  not  unusual. 
Small-signal amplifiers, on the other hand, operate 
with significantly lower values of collector current 
and values of base-emitter voltage in the range 0.55 
V to 0.65 V are typical.
