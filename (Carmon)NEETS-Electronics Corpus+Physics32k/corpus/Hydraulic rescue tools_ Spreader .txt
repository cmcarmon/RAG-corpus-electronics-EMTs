A spreader is a hydraulic tool that is designed with two arms that come together in a narrow tip, and that uses hydraulic pressure to separate or spread the arms. The tip of the tool can be inserted into a narrow gap between two vehicle panels (such as between two doors, or between a door and a fender)â€”when the tool is operated, the arms are opened, pushing apart the metal in the panels. Spreaders may also be used to "pop" vehicle doors from their hinges.
