The advection equation is not simple to solve numerically: the system is a hyperbolic partial differential equation, and interest typically centers on discontinuous "shock" solutions (which are notoriously difficult for numerical schemes to handle).
Even with one space dimension and a constant velocity field, the system remains difficult to simulate. The equation becomes

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \psi }{\partial t}}+u_{x}{\frac {\partial \psi }{\partial x}}=0}

where

{\displaystyle \psi =\psi (x,t)}
is the scalar field being advected and

{\displaystyle u_{x}}
