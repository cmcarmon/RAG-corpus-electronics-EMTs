Superposition  of  the  theoretical  maximum  generated  current  as  a  function  of  energy  gap  and  the  diode
characteristic leads to the solar cell curve shown in Fig. 60.6. This is the diode curve offset by the light-generated
current (IL). The maximum current is called the short circuit current, Isc, while the maximum voltage is called
the open circuit voltage, Voc. The maximum power point is shown in Fig. 60.6 as the product of Vmp and Imp
as the IV curve is traced by varying the load.
