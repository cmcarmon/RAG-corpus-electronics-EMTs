Elementary Diode Circuits
Semiconductor diodes are used in a wide variety of applications. Their usage abounds in com-
munication systems (limiters, gates, clippers, mixers), computers (clamps, clippers, logic gates),
television (clamps, limiters, phase detectors), radar (power detectors, phase detectors, gain-control
circuits, parametric ampliﬁers), and radio (mixers, automatic gain-control circuits, message
detectors). Several simple diode circuits are presented in this section to serve only as examples.
In solving circuit problems with a nonlinear element, such as a diode, a useful technique
employed in many cases is a graphical approach. After plotting a nonlinear characteristic of the
element, such as the volt–ampere characteristic of a diode, one can superimpose a plot of the
circuit response (excluding the nonlinear element), which is the equation of a straight line in the
i–v plane given by the loop equation for the network. Such an equation of the straight line is
known as the load line equation. The intersection of the load line with the characteristic of the
nonlinear element in the i–v plane determines the quiescent (operating) point, which is the desired
solution. Example 7.2.1 illustrates the procedure.
