Another type of ”battery” is the solar cell, a by-product of the semiconductor revolution in
electronics. The photoelectric effect, whereby electrons are dislodged from atoms under the
inﬂuence of light, has been known in physics for many decades, but it has only been with
recent advances in semiconductor technology that a device existed capable of harnessing this
effect to any practical degree. Conversion efﬁciencies for silicon solar cells are still quite low,
but their beneﬁts as power sources are legion: no moving parts, no noise, no waste products or
pollution (aside from the manufacture of solar cells, which is still a fairly ”dirty” industry), and
indeﬁnite life.
