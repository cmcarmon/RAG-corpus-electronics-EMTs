Using state-space matrices. A simple stability test showing the power of the matrix functions built-in to
MATLAB. The Boolean function ‘all’ returns the value TRUE (or 1) if all the elements of the argument are non-zero. The
argument is itself a vector of Boolean values (that is, those values of the vector of the poles of the A matrix that are negative).
By treating matrices as “ﬁrst-class objects”, MATLAB provides many such opportunities for avoiding loops and other control
structures required to do similar tasks in conventional languages.
