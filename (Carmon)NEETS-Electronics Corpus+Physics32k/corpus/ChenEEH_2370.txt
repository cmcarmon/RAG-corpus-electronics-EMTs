The K (k)=K (k0) is the ratio of complete elliptic integrals of the
Ô¨Årst kind (Abramowitz and Stegun, 1972). Therefore, in a
CPW wave guide design, for a given substrate (er , H) and a
required characteristic impedance Z0, the central conductor
width W can be evaluated immediately by choosing an appro-
priate gap width S.
