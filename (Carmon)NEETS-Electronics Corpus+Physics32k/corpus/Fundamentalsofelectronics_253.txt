So far we have analyzed electrical circuits: The source signal has more power than the output variable,
be it a voltage or a current. Power has not been explicitly deﬁned, but no matter. Resistors, inductors,
and capacitors as individual elements certainly provide no power gain, and circuits built of them will not
magically do so either. Such circuits are termed electrical in distinction to those that do provide power
gain: electronic circuits. Providing power gain, such as your stereo reading a CD and producing sound, is
accomplished by semiconductor circuits that contain transistors. The basic idea of the transistor is to let the
weak input signal modulate a strong current provided by a source of electrical power–the power supply–to
produce a more powerful signal. A physical analogy is a water faucet: By turning the faucet back and
forth, the water ﬂow varies accordingly, and has much more power than expended in turning the handle.
The waterpower results from the static pressure of the water in your plumbing created by the water utility
pumping the water up to your local water tower. The power supply is like the water tower, and the faucet
