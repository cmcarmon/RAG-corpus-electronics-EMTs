Modern radar systems are used for early detection of surface or air objects and provide extremely
accurate information on distance, direction, height, and speed of the objects. Radar is also used to guide
missiles to targets and direct the firing of gun systems. Other types of radar provide long-distance
surveillance and navigation information.
