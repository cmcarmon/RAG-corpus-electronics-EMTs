future states and inputs, and results in better tracking. It is important to select appropriate adaptation stepsizes
for the observers because only one training pattern, consisting of the most recent set of plant inputs and states,
is available for training. In order to compare the neural identiÔ¨Åcation and control methodology with another
potential control methodology, a PI-type controller has been designed for the HVAC system. Typical responses
of the system with PI-type controller are shown in Fig. 100.67.
