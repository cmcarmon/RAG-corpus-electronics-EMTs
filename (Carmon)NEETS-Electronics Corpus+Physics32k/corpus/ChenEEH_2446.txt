Half-Wave Dipole Antenna
A dipole antenna with L ¼ l0=2, called a half-wave dipole, is
often useful because it operates close to a resonant condition of
its input impedance. This results in an almost real value of the
input impedance, which can be easily matched to an input
source having a real source impedance for maximum power
transfer. For this case, the equations 6.151 and 6.152 can be
simpliﬁed:
