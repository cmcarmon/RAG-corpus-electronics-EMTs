In contrast to the above Gaussian wave packet, it has been observed that a particular wave function based on Airy functions, propagates freely without envelope dispersion, maintaining its shape. It accelerates undistorted in the absence of a force field: ψ=Ai(B(x−B³t ²)) exp(iB³t(x−2B³t²/3)). (For simplicity, ħ=1, m=1/2, and B is a constant, cf. nondimensionalization.)

Nevertheless, there is no dissonance with Ehrenfest's theorem in this force-free situation, because the state is both non-normalizable and has an undefined (infinite) ⟨x⟩ for all times. (To the extent that it could be defined, ⟨p⟩ = 0 for all times, despite the apparent acceleration of the front.)
In phase space, this is evident in the pure state Wigner quasiprobability distribution of this wavetrain, whose shape in x and p is invariant as time progresses, but whose features accelerate to the right, in accelerating parabolas B(x−B³t ²) + (p/B − tB²)² = 0,

Note the momentum distribution obtained by integrating over all x is constant. Since this is the probability density in momentum space, it is evident that the wave function itself is not normalizable.
