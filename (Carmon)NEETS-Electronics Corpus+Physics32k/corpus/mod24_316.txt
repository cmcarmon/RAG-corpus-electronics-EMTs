MULTIMODE GRADED-INDEX FIBERS have a core of radius (a). Unlike step-index fibers, the
value of the refractive index of the core (n1) varies according to the radial distance (r). The value of n1
decreases until it approaches the value of the refractive index of the cladding (n2). Like the step-index
fiber, the value of n2 is constant and has a slightly lower refractive index than n1.
