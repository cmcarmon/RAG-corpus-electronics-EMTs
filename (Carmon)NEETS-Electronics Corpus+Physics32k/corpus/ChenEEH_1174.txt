Interconnect crosscapacitance noise refers to charge injected
in quiet wires (victims) by neighboring switching wires
(aggressors) through the capacitance between them (cross-
capacitance). The resulting noise has the form of a pulse in
which the leading edge is determined by the switching slew of
the aggressor, and the trailing edge is determined by the re-
storing time constant of the victim. This is perceived to be the
most signiÔ¨Åcant source of noise in current processes (see
