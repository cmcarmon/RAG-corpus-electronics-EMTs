INTEGRATED CIRCUIT (IC)—(1) A circuit in which many elements are fabricated and
interconnected by a single process (into a single chip), as opposed to a nonintegrated circuit
in which the transistors, diodes, resistors, and other components are fabricated separately and
then assembled. (2) Elements inseparably associated and formed on or within a single
substrate.
