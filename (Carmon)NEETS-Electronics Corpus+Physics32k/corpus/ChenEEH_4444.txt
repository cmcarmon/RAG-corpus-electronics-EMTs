At least two issues are of interest relative to the state estima-
tion problem. First, does there exist a state estimation gain
vector K(k) such that ^xx is guaranteed to converge to x regard-
less of initial condition and the sequence u(k)? Second, how
should the designer select the gain vector K(k)?
