According to research by the advocacy web site kidsandcars.org, back up collisions were the leading cause (34%) for U.S. non-traffic fatalities of children under 15 from 2006–2010.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control reported that from 2001–2003, an estimated 7,475 children (CI = 4,453--10,497) (2,492 per year) under the age of 15 were treated for automobile back-over incidents. About 300 fatalities per year result from backup collisions.
The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that back-up collisions most often:
occur in residential driveways and parking lots
involve sport utility vehicles (SUVs) or small trucks
occur when a parent, relative or someone known to the family is driving
particularly affect children less than five years old
The driver of the car backing up and hitting an object, a person, or another car is usually considered to be at fault.
