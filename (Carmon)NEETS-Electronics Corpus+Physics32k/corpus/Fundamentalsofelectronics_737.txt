6.2 Types of Communication Channels2
Electrical communications channels are either wireline or wireless channels. Wireline channels physically
connect transmitter to receiver with a “wire” which could be a twisted pair, coaxial cable or optic ﬁber.
Consequently, wireline channels are more private and much less prone to interference. Simple wireline
channels connect a single transmitter to a single receiver: a point-to-point connection as with the telephone.
Listening in on a conversation requires that the wire be tapped and the voltage measured. Some wireline
channels operate in broadcast modes: one or more transmitter is connected to several receivers. One simple
example of this situation is cable television. Computer networks can be found that operate in point-to-point
or in broadcast modes. Wireless channels are much more public, with a transmitter’s antenna radiating
a signal that can be received by any antenna suﬃciently close enough.
In contrast to wireline channels
where the receiver takes in only the transmitter’s signal, the receiver’s antenna will react to electromagnetic
radiation coming from any source. This feature has two faces: The smiley face says that a receiver can take
in transmissions from any source, letting receiver electronics select wanted signals and disregarding others,
thereby allowing portable transmission and reception, while the frowny face says that interference and noise
are much more prevalent than in wireline situations. A noisier channel subject to interference compromises
the ﬂexibility of wireless communication.
