LiNbO3-based devices have been commercially available since 1985 and have been incorporated in a large
number of experimental systems. The basic LiNbO3 waveguide fabrication technique was developed in 1974
and has been continually reﬁned and improved during subsequent years. The material itself ﬁnds wide appli-
cation  in  a  number  of  electrical  and  optical  devices  because  of  its  excellent  optical,  electrical,  acoustic,  and
electro- and acousto-optic properties. For example, almost all color television sets manufactured today incor-
porate a surface-acoustic-wave (SAW) electrical ﬁlter based on LiNbO3.
