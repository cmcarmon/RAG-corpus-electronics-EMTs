Such devices are called Ground Fault Current Interruptors, or GFCIs for short. Outside
North America, the GFCI is variously known as a safety switch, a residual current device
(RCD), an RCBO or RCD/MCB if combined with a miniature circuit breaker, or earth leakage
circuit breaker (ELCB). They are compact enough to be built into a power receptacle. These
receptacles are easily identiﬁed by their distinctive ”Test” and ”Reset” buttons. The big advan-
tage with using this approach to ensure safety is that it works regardless of the appliance’s
design. Of course, using a double-insulated or grounded appliance in addition to a GFCI recep-
tacle would be better yet, but its comforting to know that something can be done to improve
safety above and beyond the design and condition of the appliance.
