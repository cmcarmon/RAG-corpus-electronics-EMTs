One of the more interesting aspects of an operational amplifier is that it can be used to perform
mathematical operations electronically. Properly connected, an operational amplifier can add, subtract,
multiply, divide, and even perform the calculus operations of integration and differentiation. These
amplifiers were originally used in a type of computer known as the "analog computer" but are now used
in many electronic applications.
