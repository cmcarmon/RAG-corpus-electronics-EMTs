shift-in clock operating in conjunction with an input ready signal which indicates whether the memory is able
to  accept  further  words  or  is  now  full.  The  data  entered  is  automatically  shifted  in  parallel  to  the  adjacent
memory location if it is empty and as this continues the data words stack up at the output end of the memory.
At the output port, data transfers are controlled by a shift-out clock and its associated output ready signal. The
output ready signal indicates either that a data word is ready to be shifted out or that the memory is now empty.
FIFOs can easily be cascaded to any desired depth and operated in parallel to give any required word length.
This type of memory is widely used in controlling transfers of data between digital subsystems which operate
at different clock rates and is often known as an elastic buffer.
