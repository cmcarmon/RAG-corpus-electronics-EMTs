Levels 1 through 7 are called single-machine levels because the
operating system at these levels deals exclusively with the
resources of a single machine. A single machine may contain
one or several processors that share a common memory. A
multimachine consists of several physically separate computer
systems, each of which has its own processor(s) and private
memory. There is no shared memory among the separate
computers in a multimachine.
