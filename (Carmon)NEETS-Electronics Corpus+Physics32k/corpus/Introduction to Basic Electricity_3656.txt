The output of the rectifier circuit is a pulsating DC 
voltage. This is not suitable for most electronic cir-
cuits, so a filter follows the rectifier in most power 
supplies. The filter converts the pulsating DC volt-
age to a smooth DC voltage. The simplest filter is a 
capacitor filter connected across the output of the 
rectifier (Figure 36-14). Figure 36-15 compares the 
outputs of a rectifier without and with the addition of 
a filter capacitor.
