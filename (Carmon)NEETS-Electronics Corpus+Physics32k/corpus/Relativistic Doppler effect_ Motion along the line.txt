Assume the observer and the source are moving away from each other with a relative velocity



v



{\displaystyle v\,}
(



v



{\displaystyle v\,}
is negative if the observer and the source are moving towards each other). Considering the problem in the reference frame of the source, suppose one wavefront arrives at the observer. The next wavefront is then at a distance

{\displaystyle \lambda =c/f_{s}\,}
away from the observer (where



λ



{\displaystyle \lambda \,}
is the wavelength,

{\displaystyle f_{s}\,}
is the frequency of the wave the source emitted, and



c



{\displaystyle c\,}
is the speed of light).
The wavefront moves with velocity
