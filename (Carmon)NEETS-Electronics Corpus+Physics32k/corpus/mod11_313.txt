The LOADED MICROWAVE LENS, shown in figure 3-12, is a multi-cellular array of thousands of 
cells. Each cell contains a slow-wave (delayed), serrated-metal, plastic-supported waveguide element 
which acts as a phase-controlling device. A loaded lens can focus microwave energy in much the same 
way as the waveguide type. The reason is that the speed of propagation is higher in the region between 
parallel plates than in free space. The parallel plates support the cells.
