so DID S /IDS = â€“0.45 (DVP /VP) + 0.77 (DIDS S /IDSS), and thus a 10% change in VP will result in approximately a
4.5% change in IDS , and a 10% change in IDSS will result in an 8% change in IDS. Thus, although the situation
is  improved  with  the  self-biasing  circuit  using  RS ,  there  will  still  be  a  substantial  variation  in  the  quiescent
current with changes in the JFET parameters.
