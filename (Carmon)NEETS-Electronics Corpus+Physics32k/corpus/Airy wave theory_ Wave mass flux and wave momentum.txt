which is an exact result for periodic progressive water waves, also valid for nonlinear waves. However, its validity strongly depends on the way how wave momentum and mass flux are defined. Stokes already identified two possible definitions of phase velocity for periodic nonlinear waves:
Stokes first definition of wave celerity (S1) – with the mean Eulerian flow velocity equal to zero for all elevations z below the wave troughs, and
Stokes second definition of wave celerity (S2) – with the mean mass transport equal to zero.
The above relation between wave momentum M and wave energy density E is valid within the framework of Stokes' first definition.
However, for waves perpendicular to a coast line or in closed laboratory wave channel, the second definition (S2) is more appropriate. These wave systems have zero mass flux and momentum when using the second definition. In contrast, according to Stokes' first definition (S1), there is a wave-induced mass flux in the wave propagation direction, which has to be balanced by a mean flow U in the opposite direction – called the undertow.
So in general, there are quite some subtleties involved. Therefore also the term pseudo-momentum of the waves is used instead of wave momentum.
