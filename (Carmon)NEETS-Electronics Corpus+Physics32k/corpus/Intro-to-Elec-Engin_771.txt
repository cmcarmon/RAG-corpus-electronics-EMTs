A fundamental circuit of digital logic is the transistor switch, or inverter, which is considered
in Section 9.1. Basic logic circuits are developed in Section 9.2 using bipolar technology.
Section 9.3 deals with other logic families, particularly the FET-based family known as CMOS
(complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) technology.
