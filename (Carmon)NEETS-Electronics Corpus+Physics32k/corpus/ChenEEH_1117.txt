MEMS accelerometers are made or sold by dozens of com-
panies. Of these micro-accelerometers, those from Analog
Devices are noteworthy and will be discussed in the subsection
on MEMS sensors. Unlike most commercial microaccelerom-
eters, the analog devices accelerometer (ADXL) components
have the microelectronics and micromechanics integrated on
the same silicon substrate. The company has sold a 100 million
of the components, primarily for triggers for air bags, since
the mid-1990s. An employee of Analog Devices stated that
there have been only a small number of failures involving
deployment in an accident or deployment without a crash.
Assuming that the annual sales rate is constant and that cars
are driven about 300 hours per year, a simple calculation gives
reliability better than one failure per 1010 hrs more than
1 million years). The rate of failure could also be calculated
per turn-on of the car (when the ADXL goes through a self-test
routine). Since the deceleration history of cars in actual use is
generally unknown, it is not possible to compute failures per
various levels of deceleration. The rarity of failures, however,
ensures that such numbers would be very small. Further,
because the ADXL MEMS components are part of an air bag
subsystem, it is not clear whether it was the MEMS device
or some other part of the subsystem that failed. It is possible
that failure of the MEMS device is rarely the cause of an
improper event.
