Kalman ﬁltering addresses these shortcomings at the cost of signiﬁcantly greater computational complexity.
Target equations of motion are modeled explicitly such that the position, velocity, and potentially higher-order
derivatives of each measurement dimension are estimated by the track ﬁlter as a state vector. The error associated
with the estimated state vector is modeled via a covariance matrix that is also updated with each iteration of
the track ﬁlter. The covariance matrix determines the weight vector used to update the smoothed state vector
in order to incorporate such factors as measurement  S/N and dynamic target maneuvering.
