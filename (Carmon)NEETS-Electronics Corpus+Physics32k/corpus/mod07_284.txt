The three most important aspects of this characteristic curve are (1) the forward current increase to a 
peak (IP) with a small applied forward bias, (2) the decreasing forward current with an increasing forward 
bias to a minimum valley current (IV), and (3) the normal increasing forward current with further 
increases in the bias voltage. The portion of the characteristic curve between IP and IV is the region of 
negative resistance. An explanation of why a tunnel diode has a region of negative resistance is best 
understood by using energy levels as in the previous explanation of the Zener effect.
