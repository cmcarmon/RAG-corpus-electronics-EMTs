Plug the tube to be tested into its proper socket. (Use the pin straighteners before plugging in 7- and
9-pin miniature tubes.) Select the proper card or cards for the tube to be tested. Insert the card selected
into the slot in the card switch until the CARD REJECT KNOB pops up. The card will operate the tester
only if it is fully inserted and the printing is up and toward the operator. Do not put paper or objects other
than program cards into the card switch, because they will jam the switch contacts. If the overload shuts
off the tester when the card is inserted in the switch, check to see that the proper card is being used for the
tube under test and that the tube under test has a direct interelement short.
