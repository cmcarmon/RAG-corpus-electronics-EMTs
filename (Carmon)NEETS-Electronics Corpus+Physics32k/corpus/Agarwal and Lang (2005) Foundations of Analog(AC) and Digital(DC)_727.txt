The engineers now turn their attention to the input voltage levels required by Disco’s
static discipline. Yehaa’s devices are able to interpret voltages as high as 2 V as a logical 0,
so they can interpret any voltage between 0 V and 2 V (VIL) as a logical 0, just as required
by Disco’s static discipline. Thus, the Yehaa devices satisfy the VIL requirement.
Similarly, Yehaa’s devices are able to interpret voltages between 3.5 V (VIH) and 5 V as
a logical 1, which again satisfies the VIH requirement of Disco’s static discipline. The fact
that the Yehaa devices interpret certain voltages in Disco’s forbidden region (specifically,
those between 3 V and 3.5 V) as a logical 1 is irrelevant since devices are allowed arbitrary
behavior for values in the forbidden region.
