In physics, a squeezed coherent state is a quantum state that is usually described by two non-commuting observables having continuous spectra of eigenvalues. Examples are position



x


{\displaystyle x}
and momentum



p


{\displaystyle p}
of a particle, and the (dimension-less) electric field in the amplitude



X


{\displaystyle X}
(phase 0) and in the node



Y


{\displaystyle Y}
(phase 90°) of a light wave (the wave's quadratures). The product of the standard deviations of two such operators obeys the uncertainty principle:

and

{\displaystyle \;\Delta X\Delta Y\geq {\frac {1}{4}}}
, respectively.

Trivial examples, which are in fact not squeezed, are the ground state

The term squeezed state is actually used for states with a standard deviation below that of the ground state for one of the operators or for a linear combination of the two. The idea behind this is that the circle denoting the uncertainty of a coherent state in the quadrature phase space (see right) has been "squeezed" to an ellipse of the same area . Note that a squeezed state does not need to saturate the uncertainty principle.
Squeezed states (of light) were first produced in the mid 1980s . At that time, quantum noise squeezing by up to a factor of about 2 (3 dB) in variance was achieved, i.e.

. Today, squeeze factors larger than 10 (10 dB) have been directly observed . A recent review on squeezed states of light can be found in Ref..
