Like resistors and inductors, capacitors can be con-
nected in series, parallel, and series-parallel combina-
tions. Placing capacitors in series effectively increases 
the thickness of the dielectric. This decreases the total 
capacitance, because capacitance is inversely propor-
tional to the distance between the plates. The total 
 capacitance of capacitors in series is calculated like the 
total resistance of parallel resistors:
