At some frequency, the reactances of equivalent capacitor C1 and inductor L will be equal and the 
crystal will act as a series-tuned circuit. A series-tuned circuit has a minimum impedance at resonance 
(figure 2-21). Above resonance the series-tuned circuit acts INDUCTIVELY, and below resonance it acts 
CAPACITIVELY. In other words, the crystal unit has its lowest impedance at the series-resonance 
frequency. The impedance increases as the frequency is lowered because the unit acts as a capacitor. The 
impedance of the crystal unit also increases as the frequency is raised above the series-resonant point 
because the unit acts as an inductor. Therefore, the crystal unit reacts as a series-tuned circuit.
