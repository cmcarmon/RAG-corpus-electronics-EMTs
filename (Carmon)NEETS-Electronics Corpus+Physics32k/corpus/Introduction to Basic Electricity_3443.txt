After fabrication, the integrated circuits are tested 
on the wafer. After testing, the wafer is sliced into 
 individual chips. Each chip represents one complete 
integrated circuit containing all the components and 
connections associated with that circuit. Each chip 
that passes quality control tests is then mounted into 
a package. Even though a large number of integrated 
circuits are fabricated at the same time, only a certain 
number are usable. This is referred to as the yield, 
which is the maximum number of usable integrated 
circuits compared with the rejects.
