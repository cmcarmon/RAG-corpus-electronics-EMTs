What is Thomson Scattering?
Thomson scattering is the result of a collision between a photon (an electromagnetic wave) and a charged particle, such as an electron. When an electron and photon "collide" the electron feels a Lorentz force from the oscillating electric and magnetic fields of the photon and is accelerated. This acceleration causes the electron to emit a different photon in a different direction. This emitted photon has a wavelength shifted from that of the incident photon by an amount dependent on the electron energy. Another way of looking at this is that the electron absorbs the energy of the photon and re emits the energy in the form of a different electromagnetic wave. This scattering of a photon by an electron is called Thomson Scattering.
How is Thomson Scattering useful to plasma physicists?
Since the wavelength of the scattered photon depends on the energy of the scattering electron, Thomson scattering is good way to measure the energy of an electron. This is done by creating a photon of known wavelength and measuring the wavelength of the scattered photon. The Thomson Scattering configuration at MST uses a 1064 nm Nd:YAG Laser System, which produces the best time-resolution electron temperature readings in the world. We create our photons with high power lasers that we shine into a window on the top of the MST, and collect scattered photons with a large collection lens on the side of the MST.
The wavelength distribution of the scattered photons tells us the energy distribution of the electrons in the plasma, giving us a direct unobtrusive way of getting the temperature of the electrons. The amount of photons we actually collect can also tell us something about the density of the electrons in the plasma.
