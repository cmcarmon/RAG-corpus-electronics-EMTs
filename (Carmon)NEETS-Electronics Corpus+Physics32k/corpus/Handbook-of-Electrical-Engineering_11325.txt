Output switching circuitry is needed in order to time and create these waveforms. Since the load impedance
of the deﬁbrillation system ranges from 20 to 70 Ω, it is possible to have peak currents of 40 A in the output
circuit.  There  is,  therefore,  a  need  for  high-power  electronic  switches  to  carry  the  current,  such  as  Silicon
Controlled Rectiﬁers (SCRs), Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistors (MOSFETs), and Insulated
Gate  Bipolar  Transistors  (IGBTs).  In  addition,  these  switches  must  be  mounted  so  that  there  are  very  low
junctional resistances to minimize power loss. MOSFETs and IGBTs are often used in bridge circuits to facilitate
switching  of  biphasic  waveforms.  SCRs  were  used  mostly  in  generating  monophasic  waveforms,  but  are  still
used in some biphasic waveform circuits. Because these types of switches require around 15 V for the control,
it is necessary to use a low-power dc/dc converter to boost the 6 V from the battery. Timing of the switching
is  either  controlled  by  timing  circuitry,  or  by  voltage  monitoring  circuitry  that  causes  a  polarity  reversal  to
occur when the voltage falls to a certain threshold.
