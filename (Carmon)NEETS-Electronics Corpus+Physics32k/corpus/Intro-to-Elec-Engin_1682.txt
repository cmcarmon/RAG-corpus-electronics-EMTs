Figure 16.3.5 illustrates the basic elements of a minicomputer system in terms of a block diagram
for speed and voltage control (as well as data acquisition) of a turbine-generator unit. Typical
output variables of the generator are speed, rotor angle, terminal voltage, ﬁeld (excitation) current,
armature current, and real and reactive power. Some output variables are measured by digital
transducers, whose outputs are then digitally multiplexed and sent back to the minicomputer.
Some other output variables may be measured by analog transducers, whose outputs are processed
through an analog multiplexer which performs a time-division multiplexing operation. The output
of the analog multiplexer is connected to a sample-and-hold device, which samples the output
of the multiplexer at a ﬁxed time interval and then holds the signal level at its output until the
A/D converter performs the analog-to-digital conversion. Thus, following the multiplexer, time
sharing is done amid a number of signal channels.
