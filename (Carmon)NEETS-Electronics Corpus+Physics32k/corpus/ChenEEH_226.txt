Continuity and Boundedness of Solutions
Properties such as continuity and boundedness of solutions are
often desired in cases of well-behaved circuits. One would
like to expect that ‘‘small’’ changes in the circuit’s output will
result from the ‘‘small’’ change of the circuit’s input and that
the bounded circuit’s input leads to the bounded circuit’s
output. They are intimately related to the stability of circuit
solutions.
