If you had been around in the early days of electronics, you would have considered an ANTENNA 
(AERIAL) to be little more than a piece of wire strung between two trees or upright poles. In those days, 
technicians assumed that longer antennas automatically provided better reception than shorter antennas. 
They also believed that a mysterious MEDIUM filled all space, and that an antenna used this medium to 
send and receive its energy. These two assumptions have since been discarded. Modern antennas have 
evolved to the point that highly directional, specially designed antennas are used to relay worldwide 
communications in space through the use of satellites and Earth station antennas (fig. 4-1). Present 
transmission theories are based on the assumption that space itself is the only medium necessary to 
propagate (transmit) radio energy.
