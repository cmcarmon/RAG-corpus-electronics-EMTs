cortex, was not formulated until 1949 when Moruzzi and Magoun demonstrated the existence of widely spread
pathways through the central reticular core of the brainstem capable of exerting a diffuse activating inﬂuence
on the cerebral cortex. This reticular activating system has been called the brain’s response selector because it
alerts  the  cortex  to  focus  on  certain  incoming  information  while  ignoring  other.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  a
sleeping mother will immediately be awakened by her crying baby or the smell of smoke, and yet ignore the
trafﬁc outside her window or the television still playing in the next room. An in-depth discussion of these early
studies is beyond the scope of this presentation; however, for the interested reader an excellent historical review
of this early era in brain research has been recorded in a fascinating text by Brazier [1968].
