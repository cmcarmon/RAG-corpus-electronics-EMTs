In view (A) of figure 3-1 a common-emitter amplifier is shown. The output signal is an amplified
version of the input signal and is 180 degrees out of phase with the input signal. View (B) is a common-
base amplifier. In this circuit the output signal is an amplified version of the input signal and is in phase
with the input signal. In both of these circuits, the output signal is controlled by the base-to-emitter bias.
As this bias changes (because of the input signal) the current through the transistor changes. This causes
the output signal developed across the collector load (R2) to change. None of this information is new, it is
just a review of what you have already been shown regarding transistor amplifiers.
