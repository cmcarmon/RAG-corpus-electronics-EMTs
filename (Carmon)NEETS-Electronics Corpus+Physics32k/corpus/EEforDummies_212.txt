Switching is far and away the most important function in electronics. Think 
about your TV set: You turn it on and off, select a signal source from sev-
eral different input choices (such as your DVD player, cable box, or gaming 
system), and change TV channels. Your TV screen consists of millions of 
tiny pixels (picture elements), each of which is, in essence, a red, blue, or 
green light that is either on or off. All those TV control and display functions 
involve switching, whether it’s simply on/off switching or what I like to think 
of as multiple‐choice switching — that is, directing one of several input sig-
nals to your TV screen. Likewise, your smartphone, computing device, and 
even your microwave rely on on/off states (for instance, key pressed or not, 
or transmit sound now or not) for their control and operation.
