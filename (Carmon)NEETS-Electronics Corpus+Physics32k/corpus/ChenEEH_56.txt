where V1(s), V2(s), . . . , Vn(s) are the s-domain voltages
around the loop. In fact, the various time-domain theorems
considered earlier, such as the superposition, Thevenin, and
Norton theorems, series and parallel equivalent circuits and
voltage and current divisions are also valid in the s-domain.
The loop current method and node voltage method can be
applied for analysis in s-domain.
