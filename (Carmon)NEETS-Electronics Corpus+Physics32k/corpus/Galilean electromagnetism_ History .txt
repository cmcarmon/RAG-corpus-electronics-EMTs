Electromagnetism followed a reverse path compared to mechanics. In mechanics, the laws were first derived by Isaac Newton in their Galilean form. They had to wait for Einstein and his special relativity theory to take a relativistic form. Einstein has then allowed a generalization of Newton's laws of motion to describe the trajectories of bodies moving at relativistic speeds. In the electromagnetic frame, James Clerk Maxwell directly derived the equations in their relativistic form, although this property had to wait for Hendrik Lorentz and Einstein to be discovered.
As late as 1963, Purcell offered the following low velocity transformations as suitable for calculating the electric field experienced by a jet plane tranvelling in the Earth's magnetic field.

In 1973 Bellac and Levy-Leblond state that these equations are incorrect or misleading because they do not correspond to any consistent Galilean limit. Rousseaux gives a simple example showing that a transformation from an initial inertial frame to a second frame with a speed of v0 with respect to the first frame and then to a third frame moving with a speed v1 with respect to the second frame would give a result different from going directly from the first frame to the third frame using a relative speed of (v0 + v1).
Le Bellac and Levy-Leblond offer two transformations that do have consistent Galilean limits as follows:
The electric limit applies when electric field effects are dominant such as when Faraday's law of induction was insignificant.

Jackson introduces a Galilean transformation for the Faraday's equation and gives an example of a quasi-electrostatic case that also fulfills a Galilean transformation. Jackson states that the wave equation is not invariant under Galilean transformations.
In 2013, Rousseaux published a review and summary of Galilean electromagnetism.
