The overall action of the tr and atr circuits depends upon the impedance characteristics of the
quarter-wavelength section of transmission line. A quarter-wavelength, or an odd multiple of the quarter-
wavelength, transmission line presents opposite impedance values at the ends; one end of the line appears
as a short and the other end appears as an open.
