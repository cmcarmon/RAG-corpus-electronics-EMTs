Shaded Pole Motors
These motors are simple, reliable, and inefﬁcient. The stator winding is not
distributed on the rotor surface, but rather it is concentrated on salient poles.
The auxiliary winding, which has to produce ﬂux out of phase with the main
winding, is nothing but a hardwired shorted turn around a portion of the
main pole as Fig. 66.18.
