Electrostatics in its most restrictive sense is the specialization
of Maxwell’s equations to a system whose sources are steady-
state, time-invariant electric charges. Because the conservation
of charge is implicit in this deﬁnition, the unifying principle of
all the equations is the conservation of total electric ﬂux.
Therefore, electrostatics also properly includes steady-state
conduction current problems.
