In the hydrodynamic analogy of electronic circuits, an inductor can be thought of 
as  a  fluid  channel  pushing  a  flywheel  as  shown  in  Figure  2.6.  When  the  fluid  velocity 
(current) in the channel changes, the inertia of the flywheel tends to resist that change and 
maintain its original angular momentum. A large inductor corresponds to a flywheel with 
a  large  inertia,  which  will  have  a  larger  influence  on  the  flow  in  the  channel. 
Correspondingly a small inductor corresponds to a flywheel with a small inertia, which 
will have a lesser effect on the current.
