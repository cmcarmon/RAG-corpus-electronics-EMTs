1. A good conductor contains an abundance of free electrons.
2. As the cross-sectional area of a given conductor is increased, the resistance will decrease.
3. As the length of a conductor is increased, the resistance will increase.
4. In a material having a positive temperature coefficient, the resistance will increase as the
