Dynamic combinatorial chemistry has been used as a method to develop ligands for biomolecules and receptors for small molecules.
Ligands that can recognize biomolecules are being identified by preparing libraries of potential ligands in the presence of a target biomacromolecule. This approach sets the stage for their application as diagnostic biosensors for fast monitoring of imbalances and illnesses and therapeutic agents.
Individual components of certain chemical system will self-assemble to form receptors which are complementary to target molecule. In principle, the preferred library members will select and amplify based on the strongest interactions between the template and products.
