The load and source conventions are shown in Figure 1.1.3, in which point a is at a
higher potential than point b. The load receives or absorbs energy because a positive charge
goes in the direction of the current arrow from higher to lower potential. The source has
a capacity to supply energy. The voltage source is sometimes known as an electromotive
force, or emf, to convey the notation that it is a force that drives the current through the
circuit.
