If  the  denominator  of  H(s)  in  Eq.  (6.14)  contains  a  factor  (s  –  p)n,  then  p  is  said  to  be  a  pole  of  H(s)  of
order n. The output Vo(s) would also contain this factor, and its partial fraction expansion would contain the
term K/(s – p)n. Thus, the inverse transform vo(t) is of the form
