When a metallic system is heated from absolute zero, not every electron gains an energy

as equipartition dictates. Only those electrons in atomic orbitals within an energy range of

k

T


{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{2}}k_{B}T}
of the Fermi level are thermally excited. Electrons, in contrast to a classical gas, can only move into free states in their energetic neighbourhood. The one-electron energy levels are specified by the wave vector

{\displaystyle \epsilon (k)=\hbar ^{2}k^{2}/2m}
with

the electron mass. This relation separates the occupied energy states from the unoccupied ones and corresponds to the spherical surface in k-space. As

is the ground state energy in the limit

, which thus still deviates from the true ground state energy.
This implies that the ground state is the only occupied state for electrons in the limit
