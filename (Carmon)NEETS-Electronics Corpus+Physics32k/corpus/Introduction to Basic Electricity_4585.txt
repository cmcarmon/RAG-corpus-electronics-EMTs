Figure 45-10 shows the decoding logic circuit re-
quired to produce the output for a seven-segment dis-
play with a BCD input. Referring to Figure 45-7, notice 
that segment a is activated for digits 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, and 
9; segment b is activated for digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 
and 9; and so on. Boolean expressions can be formed 
to determine the logic circuitry needed to drive each 
segment of the display. The logic symbol for a BCD-
to-seven-segment decoder is shown in FigureÂ 45-11. 
This represents the circuit contained in an integrated 
circuit.
