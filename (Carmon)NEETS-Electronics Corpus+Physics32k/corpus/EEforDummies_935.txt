Until you become experienced in the ways of electronics, you’re best off 
avoiding circuits that run directly off household current. Stick with circuits 
that run off standard‐size batteries, or those small plug‐in wall transformers. 
(You can read about these DC sources in Chapter 12.) Unless you do some-
thing silly, like licking the terminal of a 9 V battery (and, yes, that will deliver 
a shock!), you’re fairly safe with these voltages and currents.
