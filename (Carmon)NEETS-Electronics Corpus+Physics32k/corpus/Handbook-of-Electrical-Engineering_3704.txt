Readout of previously recorded information is typically accomplished by using the head to sense the magnetic
stray  ﬁelds  produced  by  the  recorded  patterns  in  the  medium.  The  recorded  patterns  in  the  medium  cause
magnetic  stray  ﬁelds  to  emanate  from  the  medium  and  to  ﬂow  through  the  core  of  the  head.  Thus,  if  the
medium is moved with respect to the head, the ﬂux passing through the coil around the head will change in
a manner which is representative of the recorded magnetization pattern in the medium. By Faraday’s law of
induction, a voltage representative of the recorded information is thus induced in the coil.
