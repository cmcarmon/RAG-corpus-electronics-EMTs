Asymptotic stability:  An equilibrium state x of a system is asymptotically stable if, in addition to being stable,
**
there is an e > 0 such that whenever **x – x0
 < e, then x(t) ﬁ x as t ﬁ ¥. A system is asymptotically
stable if all the poles of the closed-loop transfer function are in the left half of the s-plane (inside the
unit circle of the z-plane for discrete systems). This is sometimes called stability.
