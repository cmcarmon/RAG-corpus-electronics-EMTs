The directed movement of the electrons occurs at a relatively low VELOCITY (rate of motion in a
particular direction). The effect of this directed movement, however, is felt almost instantaneously, as
explained by the use of figure 1-26. As a difference in potential is impressed across the conductor, the
positive terminal of the battery attracts electrons from point A. Point A now has a deficiency of electrons.
As a result, electrons are attracted from point B to point A. Point B has now developed an electron
deficiency, therefore, it will attract electrons. This same effect occurs throughout the conductor and
repeats itself from points D to C. At the same instant the positive battery terminal attracted electrons from
point A, the negative terminal repelled electrons toward point D. These electrons are attracted to point D
as it gives up electrons to point C. This process is continuous for as long as a difference of potential exists
across the conductor. Though an individual electron moves quite slowly through the conductor, the effect
of a directed drift occurs almost instantaneously. As an electron moves into the conductor at point D, an
electron is leaving at point A. This action takes place at approximately the speed a light (186,000 miles
Per Second).
