The DOUBLE-BUTTON CARBON MICROPHONE is shown in figure 1-33, view (B). Here, one 
button is positioned on each side of the diaphragm so that an increase in resistance on one side is 
accompanied by a simultaneous decrease in resistance on the other. Each button is in series with the 
battery and one-half of the transformer primary. The decreasing current in one-half of the primary and the 
increasing current in the other half produces an output voltage in the secondary winding. The output 
voltage is proportional to the sum of the primary winding signal components. This action is similar to that 
of push-pull amplifiers.
