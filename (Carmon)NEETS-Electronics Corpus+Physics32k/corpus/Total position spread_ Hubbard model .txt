The Hubbard model is a very simple and approximate model employed in Condensed matter physics to describe the transition of materials from metals to insulators. It takes into account only two parameters: i) the kinetic energy or hopping integral denoted by -t; and ii) the on-site repulsion between electrons represented by U (see the example for 1D chain of hydrogen atoms).
In Figure 1, there are two limit cases to consider: larger values of -t/U representing a strong charge fluctuation (electrons free to move) whereas for small values of -t/U the electrons are completely localized. The SS-TPS is very sensitive to these changes, because it increases faster than linearly when electrons start to present mobility (0.0 to 0.5 range of -t/U).
