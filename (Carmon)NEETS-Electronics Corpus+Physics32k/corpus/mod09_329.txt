What you must remember is that the current in circuits operating at the resonant frequency is 
relatively large in amplitude. The harmonic frequency amplitudes are relatively small. For example, the 
second harmonic of a fundamental frequency has only 20 percent of the amplitude of the resonant 
frequency. A third harmonic has perhaps 10 percent of the amplitude of the fundamental frequency.
