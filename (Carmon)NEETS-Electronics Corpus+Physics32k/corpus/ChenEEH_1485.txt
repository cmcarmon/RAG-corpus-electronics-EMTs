In addition to a distributed ﬁle system, an ideal distributed
operating system should give its users an illusion of a single
synergistic computer with the collective computing capability
extracted from a set of heterogeneous computer systems. The
Mach operating system, also developed at Carnegie-Mellon
University, is a typical distributed operating system. It handles
a variety of distributed system operations, including a uniform
ﬁle name space, a virtual shared computational memory, and
multiprocessing; it is also compatible with UNIX (Accetta et al.,
1986; Rashid et al., 1988). Another example is the Amoeba
system designed by a team in Vrije Universiteit led by Andrew
Tanenbaum (Tanenbaum, 1992).
