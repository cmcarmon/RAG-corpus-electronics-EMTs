Never touch the exposed surface of a disk. As you know (or will learn), most of the surface of the 
actual disk is protected most of the time; however, there are areas that are exposed. These areas are the 
timing hole and the read/write slots. Touching an exposed area can ruin that particular area. If you are 
familiar with Murphy's Law, you will realize the area you ruin will invariably contain the most important 
data on that disk.
