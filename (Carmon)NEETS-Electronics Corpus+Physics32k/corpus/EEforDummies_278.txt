Variable resistors (potentiometers)
Potentiometers, or pots, allow you to adjust resistance continuously. Pots 
are three‐terminal devices, meaning that they provide three places to con­
nect to the outside world. (See Figure 5­11.) Between the two outermost 
terminals is a fixed resistance — the maximum value of the pot. Between the 
center terminal and either end terminal is an amount of resistance that varies 
depending on the position of a rotatable shaft or other control mechanism on 
the outside of the pot.
