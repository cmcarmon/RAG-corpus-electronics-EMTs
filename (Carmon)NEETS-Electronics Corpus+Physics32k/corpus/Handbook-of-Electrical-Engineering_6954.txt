As an application, suppose that an undersea sonar-based device is to ﬁnd the range to a target, as shown in
Fig. 73.10, by transmitting a sonar signal X(t) and receiving the reﬂected signal Y(t). If v is the velocity of the
o is the offset that maximizes the cross-correlation RXY(t), then the range (distance) d can
sonar signal, and t
be determined from d =  vt
