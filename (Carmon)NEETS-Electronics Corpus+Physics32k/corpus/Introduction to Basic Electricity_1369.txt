Given an appropriate external force, the movement 
of electrons is from negatively charged atoms to 
 positively charged atoms. This flow of electrons is 
called  current	(i). The symbol “I” is used to  represent 
current. The amount of current is the sum of the 
charges of the moving electrons past a given point.
