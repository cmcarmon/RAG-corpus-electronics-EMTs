The Richtgeschwindigkeit (German Advisory or Suggested Speed of Travel) is a legal term in Germany describing the advisory speed limit for roads without a mandatory speed limit. Autobahns (German plural form: Autobahnen) have an advisory speed limit of 130 kilometres per hour (81 mph) on non-signposted sections.
Exceeding the advised speed is not a criminal offense, however an increased liability in the case of an accident may result from driving faster than the recommended speed, due to an increased danger of operating the vehicle.
In Germany, the Autobahn-Richtgeschwindigkeits-Verordnung (Directive on Reference Speed on Motorways), introduced in 1974, recommends a speed of no more than 130 km/h (81 mph) for autobahns and similar roads, whose lanes are separated by a median or which have at least two lanes per direction, provided there are no traffic signs posting a lower speed limit.
Until 31 August 2009, a different reference speed could be posted by the traffic signs number 380 and 381, according to §42 of the German traffic code (Straßenverkehrsordnung, StVO), as seen above. As these traffic signs were only rarely used, they meanwhile have been abolished.
