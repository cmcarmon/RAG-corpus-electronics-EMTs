cd, . . .] T is
called a clock schedule (Friedman, 1995; Fishburn, 1990). If
TCD is chosen such that equations 4.5 and 4.6 are satisﬁed for
every local data path Ri?Rf , TCD is called a consistent clock
schedule. A clock schedule that satisﬁes equation 4.7 is called a
trivial clock schedule. Note that a trivial clock schedule TCD
cd ¼ t f
implies global zero clock skew since for any i and f , t i
cd;
thus, TSkew (i, f ) ¼ 0.
