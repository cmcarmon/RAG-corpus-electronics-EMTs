The notation follows the scheme:
MCS
M corresponds to the species. These can be
atoms – e.g., Si, Ni, O, Cl,
vacancies – V or v (since V is also the symbol for vanadium)
interstitials – i
electrons – e
electron holes – h

S indicates the lattice site that the species occupies. For instance, Ni might occupy a Cu site. In this case, M would be replaced by Ni and S would be replaced by Cu. The site may also be a lattice interstice, in this case the symbol "i" is used. A cation site can be represented by the symbols C or M (for metal), and an anion site can be represented by either an A or X.
C corresponds to the electronic charge of the species relative to the site that it occupies. The charge of the species is calculated by the charge on the current site minus the charge on the original site. To continue the previous example, Ni often has the same valency as Cu, so the relative charge is zero. To indicate null charge, × is used. A single • indicates a net single positive charge, while two would represent two net positive charges. Finally, ′ signifies a net single negative charge, so two would indicate a net double negative charge.
