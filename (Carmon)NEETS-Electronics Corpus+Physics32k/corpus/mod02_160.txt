A capacitor with a voltage rating of 500 volts dc cannot be safely subjected to an alternating voltage or
a pulsating direct voltage having an effective value of 500 volts. Since an alternating voltage of 500 volts
(rms) has a peak value of 707 volts, a capacitor to which it is applied should have a working voltage of at
least 750 volts. In practice, a capacitor should be selected so that its working voltage is at least 50 percent
greater than the highest effective voltage to be applied to it.
