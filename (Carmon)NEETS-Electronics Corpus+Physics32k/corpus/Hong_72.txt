When  a  sufficiently  high  reverse  voltage  is  applied  across  a  diode,  electrical 
breakdown can occur across the PN-junction, resulting in massive conduction. In some 
cases, this effect is reversible and if used properly, will not damage the diode. This is 
known  as  the  Zener  effect  and  such  diodes  can  be  specifically  engineered  to  create  a 
similar current-voltage non-linearity in the reverse direction as in the forward direction. 
In fact, the knee in the current-voltage relationship for Zener diode can be significantly 
sharper and can range from 1.8V to greater than 100V. The symbol for a Zener diode is 
shown in Figure 6.5.  In practical electronic circuits, Zener diodes are often used to make 
voltage references as well transient voltage suppressors.
