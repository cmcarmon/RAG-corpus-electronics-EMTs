When the parameter set is not polytopic, one must typically
resort to gridding the parameter set and simultaneously solv-
ing a set of LMIs deﬁned at each grid point. The grid is reﬁned
until it is apparent (through solution convergence) that the
solution will be valid for points not on the grid. Figure 9.3
illustrates the gridding approach for a parameter set deﬁned by
Q:¼ {(u1, u2): u2 ¼ u2
is reﬁned, the number of LMI constraints multiplies; LPV
controller synthesis may become impractical from a computa-
tional standpoint.
