Microsoft MS-DOS is a single-user operating system for the
IBM PC and its successors. It was originally based on CP/M,
but many elements from UNIX have been added over the
years. Only one process at a time can be active, but a process
can create and execute a child process. Doing so, however,
suspends the parent until the child is Ô¨Ånished.
