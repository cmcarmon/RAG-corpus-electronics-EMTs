be separated into two sections if a fault occurs during a breaker
maintenance period, (b) complex automatic reclosing and
protective relaying circuitry, (c) taking the circuit out of ser-
vice to maintain the relays (common on all schemes if a single
set of relays is used), (d) the requirement of potential devices
on all circuits since there is no deÔ¨Ånite potential reference
point (these devices may be required in all cases for synchro-
nizing, live-line, or voltage indication), and (e) the breaker
failure during a fault on one of the circuits that causes loss of
one additional circuit (owing to operation of breaker-failure
relaying).
