Figure 6.1a shows a complete diagram of an operational ampliﬁer. A more common version of
the diagram is shown in ﬁgure 6.1b, where missing parts are assumed to exist. The inverting
input means that the output signal will be 1800 out of phase with the input applied to this
terminal. On the diagram V++ ≡ +VCC = +15 V (DC) and V−− ≡ −VCC = −15 V (DC).
