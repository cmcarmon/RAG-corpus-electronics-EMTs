Until  recently  the  subject  of  computer-aided  analysis  and  simulation  of  communication  systems  was  a  very
difﬁcult  research  area.  There  were  no  textbooks  devoted  to  the  subject,  and  the  fundamental  papers  were
scattered over a large number of technical journals. While a number of excellent books treated the subject of
simulation of systems in which random signals and noise are present [Rubinstein, 1981; Bratley et al., 1987],
none of these books speciﬁcally focused on communication systems.
