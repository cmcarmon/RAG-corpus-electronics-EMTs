Note that ¯Z0 = R0 = (60/
εr ) ln (b/a).
15.1.4 If the line of Problem 15.1.3 is made of copper
whose resistivity ρ = 1.72×10
−8 ·m, determine
the maximum length that can be used if losses are
not to exceed 3 dB when f = 3 GHz. For the
expression of attenuation, see Example 15.1.1.
15.1.5 For an RG-290/U aluminum rectangular wave-
guide, a = 58.42 cm and b = 29.21 cm. Compute
the theoretical and practical frequency ranges of
operation for the guide. (See Example 15.1.2.)
15.1.6 A rectangular air-ﬁlled RG-52/U is made of brass
(ρ = 3.9 × 10
