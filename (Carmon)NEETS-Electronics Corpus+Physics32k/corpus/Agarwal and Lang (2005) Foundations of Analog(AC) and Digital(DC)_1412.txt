The RC effects we have seen thus far are the source of delays in digital circuits,
and are responsible for the waveforms shown in Figure 9.3 in Chapter 9, or
those in Figure 10.1 in this chapter. Consider the two-inverter digital circuit
shown in Figure 10.14 in which inverter A drives inverter B. Inverter A is driven
by an input vIN1 and its output is vOUT1. Figure 10.15 replaces the inverters
with their internal circuits comprising MOSFETs and resistors.
