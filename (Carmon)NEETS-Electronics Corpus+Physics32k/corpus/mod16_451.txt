Notice that the scale marks are crowded on the left side of the OHMS scale, which makes them
difficult to read. Therefore, the best range to select is one in which the pointer will fall in the space from
midscale to slightly to the right side of midscale. The divisions in this area of the scale are evenly spaced
and provide for easier reading and greater accuracy.
