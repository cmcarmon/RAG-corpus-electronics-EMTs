Combining time-tested engineering and leading-edge solid state technologies, Mueller Systems’ Solid State Registers (SSR) are the industry’s most advanced composite register technology for positive displacement water meters. With friction-free operation and up to 10 digits of visual resolution, SSR registers are fully compatible with Mueller’s automated meter reading (AMR) system and its advanced metering infrastructure (AMI). SSR’s exceptional accuracy and readability enhance utilities’ ability to increase operating efficiencies and revenues, while mitigating losses and non-revenue water.
