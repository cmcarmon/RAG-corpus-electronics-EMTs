Remember, a SET input will SET the flip-flop if it is in the CLEAR state, otherwise, it will not do 
anything; a trigger at the CLEAR input can only CLEAR the circuit if it is SET; and a trigger applied to 
the TOGGLE input will cause the bistable multivibrator to change states regardless of what state it is in.
