Rank-Reduced Data Matrix Enhancement
Although these algorithms are effective in identifying sinusoidal components, the application of signal resto-
ration can improve their performance. In particular, one simply applies the signal restoration algorithm (14.133)
with mapping PT replaced by PT H . The restoration algorithm for determining that rank-q data matrix with the
block Toeplitz-Hankel structure (14.134) that approximates X is then given by
