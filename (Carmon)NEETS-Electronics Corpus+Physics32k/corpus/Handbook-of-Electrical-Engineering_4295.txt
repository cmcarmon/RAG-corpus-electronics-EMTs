HOB sensitivity to loop gain factors can be reduced by utilizing the slope of the increasing return signal, or
so-called  rate-of-rise.  Deriving  HOB  solely  from  the  rate-of-rise  has  the  disadvantage  of  rendering  the  fuze
sensitive  to  ﬂuctuating  signal  levels  such  as  might  result  from  a  scintillating  target.  The  use  of  logarithmic
ampliﬁers  decreases  the  HOB  sensitivity  to  the  reﬂectivity  range.  An  early  (excessively  high)  ﬁre  signal  can
occur if the slope of the signal ﬂuctuations equals the rate-of-rise threshold of the fuze. In practice a compromise
is generally made in which Doppler envelope amplitude and rate-of-rise contribute in some proportion of HOB.
Another method sometimes employed to reduce HOB sensitivity to fuze loop gain factors and angle of fall
is the use of FM sinusoidal modulation of suitable deviation to produce a range correlation function comprising
the zero order of a Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind. The subject of sinusoidal modulation is quite complex, but
has been treated in detail by Saunders [1990, pp. 1422–1446 and 144.41]. The most important aspects of fuze
design have to do with practical problems such as low cost, small size, ability to stand very high-g accelerations,
long life in storage, and countermeasures susceptibility.
