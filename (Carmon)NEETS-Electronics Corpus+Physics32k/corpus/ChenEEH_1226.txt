For example, the postlayout spacing heuristic in work by
Chaudhary et al. (1993) proposed a postlayout graph-based
spacing algorithm. The framework spaces out wires after
detailed routing has been ﬁnished. The cross talk effect is
based on cross talk voltage glitches because they do not con-
sider the delay. The cross talk effect from driver to sink is
simply the superposition of all glitches of wires along the
path. The potential disadvantage of this greedy operation is
the poor use of space resources around a timing-critical wire.
In Tseng et al. (1998), the graph-based optimizer preroutes
wires on the global routing grids incrementally in two stages—
net order assignment and space relaxation. The timing delay of
each critical path is calculated while taking into account inter-
connect coupling capacitance. The objective is to reduce the
delays of critical nets with negative timing slack values by
adding extra wire spacing.
