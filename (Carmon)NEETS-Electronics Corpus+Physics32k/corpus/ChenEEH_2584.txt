A passive ﬁlter is usually regarded as a two-port linear
network that allows a signal to pass over desired frequency
range(s) with minimum possible attenuation, whereas un-
desired frequency bands are attenuated as much as possible
in the given constraints. In the design of a ﬁlter, the most
important speciﬁcations are related to bandwidth, insertion
loss, stopband attenuation or out-of-band rejection, spurious
response, return loss, input/output impedance levels, VSWR,
group delay, topological size, temperature range, power hand-
ling capability, and transient response. In practice, a selected
group of those speciﬁcations is most dominant and determines
the design approach.
