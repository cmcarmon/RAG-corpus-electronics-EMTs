Consider a random process X(t) parameterized by qm, where qm is an unknown ﬁxed parameter vector of
ﬁnite  dimensionality  m  (e.g., qm ˛ ´m).  More  speciﬁcally  the  conditional  joint  probability  density  function
*qm)  is  well  known  for  every qm,  where  xn  =  [x1,  …,  xn]  is  a  realization  (or  observation  vector  or
f (x1,  …,  xn
sample vector) of the process X(t).
