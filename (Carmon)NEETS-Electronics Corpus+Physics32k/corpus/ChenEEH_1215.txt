there is always more than one aggressor coupled to the victim
line. The lumped capacitance model for this circuit is shown in
Figure 8.5. In this model, each pulling resistance, Rv or Ra, is
composed of the line resistance and the driver resistance. The
load capacitances, Ca and Cv, consist of the line capacitance
and the gate capacitance of the load driven by the line. Cm is
the coupling capacitance between the two wires. Most of the
papers about modeling cross talk noise published in the earlier
years belong to this category (Vittal and Marek-Sadowska,
1997; Pillage and Rohrer, 1990; Cong et al., 2000; Kahng
et al., 1999). In deep submicron technology, lumped models
are no longer capable of satisfying the accuracy requirements
and considering some parameters like the coupling location.
