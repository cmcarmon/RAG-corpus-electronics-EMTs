In solid-state physics and crystallography, a crystal structure is described by unit cell. There are infinite number of unit cells with different shapes and sizes, which can describe the same crystal. Let's assume that crystal structure is described by unit cell U. The supercell S of unit cell U is a unit cell, which describe the same crystal, but has larger volume, than cell U. Many methods which use supercell perturbate it somehow to determine properties. which cannot be determined by initial cell. For example, during phonon calculations by small displacement method, phonon frequencies in crystals is calculated by forces values on slightly displaced atoms in supercell. Another very important example of supercell is conventional cell of body-centered (bcc) or face-centered (fcc) cubic crystals.
