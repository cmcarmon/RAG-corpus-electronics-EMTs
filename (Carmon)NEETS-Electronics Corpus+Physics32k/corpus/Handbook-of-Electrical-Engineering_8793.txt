Object-oriented paradigm: A programming paradigm in which the world is modeled as a collection of self-
contained  objects  that  interact  by  sending  messages.  Objects  are  modules  that  contain  data  and  all
functions that are allowed to be performed on the encapsulated data. In addition, objects are related to
one another through an inheritance hierarchy.
