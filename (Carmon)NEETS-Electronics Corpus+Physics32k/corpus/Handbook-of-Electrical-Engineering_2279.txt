The reverse saturation current in short diodes is mainly determined by the diffusion constant Dp and the width
Wn  of the n region, by intrinsic concentration ni, by the doping concentration ND in the n region, and by the
diode area Aj. (In reality, IS is also slightly dependent on the reverse voltage [Phillips, 1962].)
