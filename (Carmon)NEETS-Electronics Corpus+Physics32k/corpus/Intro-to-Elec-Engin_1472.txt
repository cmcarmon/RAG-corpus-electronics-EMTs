The image is scanned left to right and top to bottom in a system of closely spaced parallel
lines. When 242.5 lines are completed at the rate of 15,734.264 lines per second (63.556 µs per
line), the raster’s visual area is scanned once; this scan is called a ﬁeld. While the next 20 lines
are not used for visual information, during that time of 1.27 ms special signals (testing, closed
captions, etc.) are inserted and the beam is retraced vertically to begin a new ﬁeld (shown as the
second ﬁeld in Figure 15.2.26). The raster (TV image area) has a standardized aspect ratio of
four units of width for each three units of height. Good performance is achieved when the raster
is scanned with 525 lines at a rate of 29.97 frames per second.
