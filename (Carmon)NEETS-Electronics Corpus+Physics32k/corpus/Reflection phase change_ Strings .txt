A wave on a string experiences a 180Â° phase change when it reflects from a point where the string is fixed. Reflections from the free end of a string exhibit no phase change. The phase change when reflecting from a fixed point contributes to the formation of standing waves on strings, which produce the sound from stringed instruments.
