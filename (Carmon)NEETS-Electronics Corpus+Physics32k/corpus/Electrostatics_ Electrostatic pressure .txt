On a conductor, a surface charge will experience a force in the presence of an electric field. This force is the average of the discontinuous electric field at the surface charge. This average in terms of the field just outside the surface amounts to:

{\displaystyle P={\frac {\varepsilon _{0}}{2}}E^{2}}
,
This pressure tends to draw the conductor into the field, regardless of the sign of the surface charge.
