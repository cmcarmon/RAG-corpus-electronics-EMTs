Power is supplied by internal rechargeable batteries that allow the instrument to operate for at least 8
hours. Recharging the batteries is accomplished by switching the POWER switch to OFF and connecting
the instrument to an ac power line. You can use the instrument when recharging the batteries on ac power,
but the recharging time will be extended.
