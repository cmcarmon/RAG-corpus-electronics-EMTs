Friction have a very large impact on supersonic duct flow. Even an infinite inlet Mach number will be reduced to sonic conditions in only 41 diameters for f = 0.02. Let us consider an example inlet Ma = 3.0 and f=0.02. For this condition L*=26 di ameters. If L is increased beyond 26D, the flow will not choke but a normal shock will form at just the right place for the subsequent subsonic frictional flow to become sonic exactly at the exit. Eventually, a very long duct will cause the feednozzle throat to become choked, thus reducing the duct mass flow. Thus supersonic friction changes the flow pattern if L > L* but does not choke the flow until L is much larger than L*.
