This realization also leads to the augmented switch-resistor-capacitor (SRC)
model of the MOSFET shown in Figure 9.24. Here, a lumped capacitor is added
to the SR model to account for the charge that must be supplied to the gate
conductor and channel in order to turn on the MOSFET. Thus, we develop
a model that describes the behavior of the MOSFET yet satisfies the lumped
matter discipline.
