Microwave energy is used in both radar and communications applications. The fact that the 
frequencies are very high and the wavelengths very short presents special problems in circuit design. 
Components that were previously satisfactory for signal generation and amplification use are no longer 
useful in the microwave region. The theory of operation for these components is discussed in this chapter. 
Because the theory of operation is sometimes difficult to understand, you need to pay particular attention 
to detail as you study this chapter. It is written in the simplest manner possible while retaining the 
necessary technical complexity.
