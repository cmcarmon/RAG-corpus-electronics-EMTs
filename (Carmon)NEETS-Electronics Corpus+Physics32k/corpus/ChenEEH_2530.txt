Although the early version of a balun was proposed
for coaxial
lines and other nonplanar structures, planar
baluns have received much attention and may be realized by
two-sided and uniplanar MIC technologies. Generally, the
baluns may be divided into two categories (Trifunovic and
Jokanovic, 1994); Marchand baluns (band-pass networks)
and double-Y baluns (all-pass networks, ideally), as shown
in Figure 7.15. This ﬁgure presents three basic transformations:
microstrip-slot line, CPW-slot line, and ﬁnite-ground CPW–
CPS line.
