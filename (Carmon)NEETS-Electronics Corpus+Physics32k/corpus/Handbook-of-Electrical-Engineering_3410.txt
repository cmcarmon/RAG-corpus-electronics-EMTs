 
of specialized A/D conversion techniques are pulse code modulation (PCM), and sigma-delta conversion.
PCM
is a common voice encoding scheme used not only by the audio industry in digital audio recordings but also
by the telecommunications industry for voice encoding and multiplexing. Sigma-delta conversion is an over-
sampling A/D conversion where signals are sampled at very high frequencies. It has very high resolution and
low distortion and is being used in the digital audio recording industry.
