An analogous version of the Biot number (usually called the "mass transfer Biot number", or





B
i


m




{\displaystyle \mathrm {Bi} _{m}}
) is also used in mass diffusion processes:






B
i


m


=




h

m



L

C




D

A
B






{\displaystyle \mathrm {Bi} _{m}={\frac {h_{m}L_{C}}{D_{AB}}}}

where:
hm - film mass transfer coefficient
LC - characteristic length
DAB - mass diffusivity.
