During a shift, power is lost in the clutch (for automatic transmissions the clutches are usually internal) due to clutch slip and the difference between the current and final output shaft speeds. This makes a quick shift more desirable when towing, to reduce clutch wear and heat developed in the transmission. Balancing this, too quick a shift increases peak mechanical loads on the transmission, engine and drive train; an instant shift would cause impact loads and lead to early mechanical failure, as well as an unpleasant driving experience.
