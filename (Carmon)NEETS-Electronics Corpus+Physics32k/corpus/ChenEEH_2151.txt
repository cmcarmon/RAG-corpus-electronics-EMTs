All magnetostatic ﬁelds must satisfy the equations 1.28
through 1.31. Very few magnetostatic problems, however,
have simple and analytical solutions for the vector ﬁelds B
and H. Table 1.2 contains a representative list of problems
that do have simple analytical solutions. These problems all
contain much symmetry, which is the key to arriving at these
simple solutions.
