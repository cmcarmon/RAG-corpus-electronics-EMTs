Other  approaches  for  clock  distribution  are  gaining  in  importance.  For  example,  a  lower  frequency  clock
can be distributed across the VLSI circuit, with phase-locked loops (PLLs) used to multiply the clock rate at
various sites on the circuit. In addition to multiplying the low clock rate, the PLL can also adjust the phase of
the high rate clock, correcting clock skew which may have been introduced in the routing of the low rate clock
to that PLL. Another approach is to generate a local clock at a local register when the register input data changes.
This  self-timed  circuit  approach  leads  to  asynchronous  circuits  but  can  be  quite  effective  for  register-transfer
logic (generating a local clock for a large register).
