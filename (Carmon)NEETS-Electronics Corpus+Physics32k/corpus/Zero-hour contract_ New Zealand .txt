In 2015, the television show Campbell Live revealed that large corporate hospitality companies such as Burger King and McDonald's, KFC, Starbucks, Pizza Hut, Carl's Jr. (all under Restaurant Brands), Sky City and Hoyts, all use zero hour contracts to reduce costs. On 9 April, Restaurant Brands agreed to do away with zero hours contracts.
A bill outlawing zero hour contracts was unanimously passed on 10 March 2016 and went into effect on 1 April.
