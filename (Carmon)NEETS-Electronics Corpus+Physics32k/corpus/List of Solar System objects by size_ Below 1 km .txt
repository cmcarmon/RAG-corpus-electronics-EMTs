This list contains only a few examples of objects below 1 km in radius.
In the asteroid belt alone there are estimated to be between 1.1 and 1.9 million objects with a radius above 0.5 km, many of which are in the range 0.5–1.0 km. Countless more have a radius below 0.5 km.
Very few objects in this size range have been explored or even imaged. The exceptions are objects that have been visited by a probe, or have passed close enough to Earth to be imaged. Radius is by mean geometric radius. Number of digits not an endorsement of significant figures. Mass scale shifts from × 1015 to 1012 kg, which is 1015 grams (Petagram – Pg).
Currently most of the objects of mass between 109 kg to 1012 kg (less than 1000 teragrams (Tg)) listed here are near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). (See also List of NEAs by distance from Sun.) 1994 WR12 has less mass than the Great Pyramid of Giza, 5.9 × 109 kg.
