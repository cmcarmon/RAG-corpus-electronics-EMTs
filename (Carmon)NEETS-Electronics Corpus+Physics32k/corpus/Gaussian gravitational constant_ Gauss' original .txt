Gauss begins his Theoria Motus by presenting without proof several laws concerning the motion of bodies about the Sun. Later in the text, he mentions that Pierre-Simon Laplace treats these in detail in his Mécanique Céleste. Gauss' final two laws are as follows:
The area swept by a line joining a body and the Sun divided by the time in which it is swept gives a constant quotient. This is Kepler's second law of planetary motion.
The square of this quotient is proportional to the parameter (that is, the latus rectum) of the orbit and the sum of the mass of the Sun and the body. This is a modified form of Kepler's third law.
He next defines:
2p as the parameter (i.e., the latus rectum) of a body's orbit,
μ as the mass of the body, where the mass of the Sun = 1,
1/2g as the area swept out by a line joining the Sun and the body,
t as the time in which this area is swept,
and declares that

is "constant for all heavenly bodies". He continues, "it is of no importance which body we use for determining this number," and hence uses Earth, defining
unit distance = Earth's mean distance (that is, its semi-major axis) from the Sun,
unit time = one solar day.
He states that the area swept out by Earth in its orbit "will evidently be" π√p, and uses this to simplify his constant to

Here, he names the constant k and plugging in some measured values, t = 365.2563835 days, μ = 1/354710 solar masses, achieves the result k = 0.01720209895.
