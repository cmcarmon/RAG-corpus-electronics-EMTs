2. Note from Eq. (4.5) that source transformation is not possible when
R ⫽ 0
, which is the case with an ideal voltage source. However, for
a practical, nonideal voltage source, 
. Similarly, an ideal cur-
rent source with 
cannot be replaced by a ﬁnite voltage source.
More will be said on ideal and nonideal sources in Section 4.10.1.
