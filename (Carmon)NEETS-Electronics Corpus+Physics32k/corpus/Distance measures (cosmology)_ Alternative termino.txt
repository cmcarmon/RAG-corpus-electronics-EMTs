Peebles (1993) calls the transverse comoving distance the "angular size distance", which is not to be mistaken for the angular diameter distance. Even though it is not a matter of nomenclature, the comoving distance is equivalent to the proper motion distance, which is defined as the ratio of the transverse velocity and its proper motion in radians per time. Occasionally, the symbols



Ï‡


{\displaystyle \chi }
or



r


{\displaystyle r}
are used to denote both the comoving and the angular diameter distance. Sometimes, the light-travel distance is also called the "lookback distance".
