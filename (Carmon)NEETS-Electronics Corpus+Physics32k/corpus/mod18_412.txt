The phase detectors compare the phase of the bearing and elevation IF with a reference IF from the
range channels. This comparison  produces the dc error pulses needed to drive the antenna servos. The
signals from both the bearing and elevation channels are the result of a summation process. They can be
either positive (in-phase) or negative (180-degrees out of phase) when compared to the reference IF
signal. For example, if the output of horns A and C is smaller than the output of horns B and D, a negative
or 180-degree-out-of-phase signal is produced by the bearing channel (A + C) - (B + D). If output A + C
is greater than output B + D, a positive or in-phase signal is produced by the bearing channel. The phase
of the bearing and elevation output signals determines the direction in which the antenna moves; the
magnitude of the signal determines the amount of movement. Since two signals must be present at the
phase detector to produce an output, an error signal occurs only when a return echo is not on the antenna
beam axis.
