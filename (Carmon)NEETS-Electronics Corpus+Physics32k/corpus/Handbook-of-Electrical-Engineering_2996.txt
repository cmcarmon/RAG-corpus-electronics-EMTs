where RC po, RC mo, and RCoo, respectively, represent the Th√©venin resistances seen by the capacitors, Cp, Cm, and
Co,  under  the  conditions  that  (1)  all  capacitors  are  supplanted  by  open  circuits  and  (2) the  output  voltage
response, VOS, is constrained to zero while maintaining nonzero input signal source voltage. It can be shown
that when Ro is very large and Rc is negligibly small,
