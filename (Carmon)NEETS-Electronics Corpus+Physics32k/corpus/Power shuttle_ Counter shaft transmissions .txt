In this case generally forward reverse synchronizers are replaced by the multi-plate friction clutches. Typically the multi-plate clutches are arranged on the main shaft or on the counter shaft. The forward reverse section of the gear box is generally located in the forward section as close to the engine as possible. This is beneficial to the forward reverse control elements as they are not subjected to the high relative torque.The challenge involved in providing this feature in the existing transmissions is the complex shaft arrangement. This problem arises due to the limitation of centre distance between the two shafts and fixed axial dimensions due to the vehicle size limitations.
