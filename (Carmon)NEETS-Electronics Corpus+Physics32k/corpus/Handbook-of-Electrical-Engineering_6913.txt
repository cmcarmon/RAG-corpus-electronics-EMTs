Standard defenses are (1) shielding of lines and circuits, (2) twisted wire pairs or coaxial cables, (3) short lines
and  leads,  (4)  digital  regeneration  at  waypoints  of  digital  signals,  (5)  narrowband  signals,  (6)  correlation  of
received signals with multipaths, and (7) adaptive notch ﬁltering to eliminate interference at known frequencies;
e.g., the second harmonic of 60-Hz ac power lines may interfere with biological microvoltage measurements
but  could  be  eliminated  via  adaptive  notch  ﬁltering.  Ferrite  beads  can  dampen  interference  [Barnes,  1987].
Digital  signal  processing,  spectral  shaping  ﬁlters  [see  Brown,  1983],  and  frequency-shift  ﬁlters  [see  Gardner,
1990, p. 400] can be used to lower noise power. Kalman ﬁltering is a powerful estimation method, and frequency-
shift ﬁltering is a newer technique for discriminating against both measurement error (e.g., in system identi-
ﬁcation applications) and extrinsic sources of both noise and interference [Gardner, 1990, p. 400].
