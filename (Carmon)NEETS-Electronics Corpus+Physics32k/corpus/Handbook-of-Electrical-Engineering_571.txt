Harmonic Distortion
When  a  sinusoidal  signal  of  a  single  frequency  is  applied  at  the  input  of  a  nonlinear  device  or  circuit,  the
resulting output contains frequency components that are integer multiples of the input signal. These harmonics
are  generated  by  the  nonlinearity  of  the  circuit  and  the  harmonic  distortion  is  measured  by  comparing  the
magnitudes of the harmonics with the fundamental component (input frequency) of the output.
