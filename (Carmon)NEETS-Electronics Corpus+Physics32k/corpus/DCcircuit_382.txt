Remember that meter test leads are part of the whole equipment package, and that they
should be treated with the same care and respect that the meter itself is. If you need a special
accessory for your test leads, such as a spring clip or other special probe tip, consult the product
catalog of the meter manufacturer or other test equipment manufacturer. Do not try to be
creative and make your own test probes, as you may end up placing yourself in danger the
next time you use them on a live circuit.
