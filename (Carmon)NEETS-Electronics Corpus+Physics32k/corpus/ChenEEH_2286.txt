For nonmagnetic layers,
it may be easily shown that this
matching equation can only be satisﬁed in the TMz case
(there is always a nonzero reﬂection coefﬁcient in the TEz
case, unless the trivial case of identical medium is considered).
The angle ub, at which no reﬂection occurs, is called the
Brewster angle. For the TMz case, a simple algebraic manipu-
lation of equation 3.89 yields the result:
