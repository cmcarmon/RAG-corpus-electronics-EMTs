A mechanical system can involve constraints on both the generalized coordinates and their derivatives. Constraints of this type are known as non-holonomic. First-order non-holonomic constraints have the form




g
(

q

,




q

Ë™



,
t
)
=
0

,


{\displaystyle g(\mathbf {q} ,{\dot {\mathbf {q} }},t)=0\,,}

An example of such a constraint is a rolling wheel or knife-edge that constrains the direction of the velocity vector. Non-holonomic constraints can also involve next-order derivatives such as generalized accelerations.
