This list is not intended to be all-inclusive, for there are many other applications that utilize the talents and
skills of the biomedical engineer. In fact, the list of activities of biomedical engineers depends upon the medical
environment in which they work. This is especially true for the “clinical engineers,” i.e., biomedical engineers
employed in hospitals or clinical settings.
