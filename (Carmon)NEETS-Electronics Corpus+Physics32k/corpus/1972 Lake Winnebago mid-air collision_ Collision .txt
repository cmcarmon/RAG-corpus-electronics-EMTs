Operating in bright sunshine beneath a scattered cloud layer, Flights 290 and 671 collided at 10:36:47 a.m. CDT over Wisconsin's Lake Winnebago about 6 nautical miles (6.9 mi, 11 km) south of Appleton and 2.5 nautical miles (2.9 mi, 4.6 km) east of Neenah, Wisconsin, at an altitude of about 2,500 feet (762 m). A mid-air explosion and fire ensued, and both aircraft crashed into the lake.
The National Transportation Safety Board noted that the North Central crew would have had to look toward the sun to see the approaching Air Wisconsin plane and concluded that they took no evasive action. Some eyewitnesses believed that the Air Wisconsin Twin Otter began a turn seconds before the collision, but the NTSB did not find sufficient evidence to conclude that the Air Wisconsin crew took evasive action. The rate of closure during the final five seconds before the collision was 688 feet (210 m) per second, i.e., 469 mph (755 km/hr).
