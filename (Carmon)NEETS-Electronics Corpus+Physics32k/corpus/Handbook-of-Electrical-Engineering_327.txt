Norton theorem: The voltage across an element that is connected to two terminals of a linear, bilateral network
is equal to the short-circuit current between these terminals in the absence of the element, divided by
the  admittance  of  the  network  looking  back  from  the  terminals  into  the  network,  with  all  generators
replaced by their internal admittances.
