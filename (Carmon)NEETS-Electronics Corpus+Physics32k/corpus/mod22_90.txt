SNAP II is a modern shipboard computer system designed to support shipboard and intermediate-
level maintenance, supply, financial, and administrative functions. If this sounds confusing, it really isn't, 
for the systems are designed to be user-friendly; that is, operating instructions are written in everyday 
English. Figure 1-11 shows the AN/UYK-62 (V) Data Processing Set. This is the SNAP II computer and 
its associated hardware.
