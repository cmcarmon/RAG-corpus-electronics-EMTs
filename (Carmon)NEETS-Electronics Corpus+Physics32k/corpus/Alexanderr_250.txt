In  this  and  the  following  sections,  we  consider  some  useful  op  amp
circuits  that  often  serve  as  modules  for  designing  more  complex  cir-
cuits. The ﬁrst of such op amp circuits is the inverting ampliﬁer shown
in  Fig.  5.10.  In  this  circuit,  the  noninverting  input  is  grounded,  vi is
connected to the inverting input through R1, and the feedback resistor
Rf is connected between the inverting input and output. Our goal is to
obtain the relationship between the input voltage vi and the output volt-
age vo. Applying KCL at node 1,
