▶✓ Smoothing out voltage: Power supplies that convert AC to DC, such as 
your cellphone charger, often take advantage of the fact that capacitors 
don’t react quickly to sudden changes in voltage. These devices use 
large electrolytic capacitors to smooth out varying DC supplies. These 
smoothing capacitors keep the output voltage at a relatively constant 
level by discharging through the load when the DC supply falls below a 
certain level. This is a classic example of using a capacitor to store elec-
trical energy until you need it: When the DC supply can’t maintain the 
voltage, the capacitor gives up some of its stored energy to take up the 
slack.
