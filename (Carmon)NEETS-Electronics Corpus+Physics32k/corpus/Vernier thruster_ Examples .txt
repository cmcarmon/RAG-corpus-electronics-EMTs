The R-7 rocket family, with over 1700 successful launches to date, still depends on the S1.358000 vernier thusters in its first and second stage. Most of the larger Soviet missiles and launch vehicles also used verniers. Examples include the RD-8 on the Zenit rocket family, the RD-855 and RD-856 on the R-36, and the RD-0214 on the Proton rocket family.
On the SM-65 Atlas, the LR-101 verniers were used for roll control and to fine-tune the vehicle attitude after main engine cutoff. The Delta II and Delta III rocket also used the LR-101 for vehicle roll maneuver since one engine cannot do a roll maneuver (although the later GEM 46 had thrust vectoring nozzle, only three were equipped with this feature and only ignited a brief moment during the ascent).
The Space Shuttle reaction control system had six vernier engines or thrusters in its VRCS or "Vernier Reaction Control System". The system could also deliver a gentle steady thrust which was regularly used to reboost the International Space Station while docked. For example, during STS-130 commander George Zamka and pilot Terry Virts fired Endeavour's VRCS for a duration of 33 minutes to attain an orbit between 180.5 and 190.0 nmi.
