Magnetic induction will always produce a pole polarity on the material being magnetized opposite
that of the adjacent pole of the magnetizing force. It is sometimes possible to bring a weak north pole of a
magnet near a strong magnet north pole and note attraction between the poles. The weak magnet, when
placed within the magnetic field of the strong magnet, has its magnetic polarity reversed by the field of
the stronger magnet. Therefore, it is attracted to the opposite pole. For this reason, you must keep a very
weak magnet, such as a compass needle, away from a strong magnet.
