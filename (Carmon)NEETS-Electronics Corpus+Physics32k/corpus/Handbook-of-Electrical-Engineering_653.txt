The performance evaluation of communications systems can be done analytically only in the simplest cases;
usually,  computer  simulation  is  required.  However,  if  computer  simulations  of  RF  communications  systems
are performed directly in the RF domain, then the sampling frequency for the simulation depends on both the
carrier  frequency  and  the  bandwidth  of  the  transmitted  signal.  The  high  carrier  frequency  results  in  a  high
sampling frequency and consequently a long simulation time. On the other hand, the parameters of a bandpass
system do not depend on the actual value of the carrier frequency.
