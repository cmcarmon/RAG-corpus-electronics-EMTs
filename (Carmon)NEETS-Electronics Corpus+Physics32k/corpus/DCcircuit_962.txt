Sure enough, the voltage ﬁgures all turn out to be the same: 20 volts across R1 (nodes 1
and 2), 8 volts across R2 (nodes 2 and 0), and 1 volt across R3 (nodes 2 and 3). Take note of the
signs of all these voltage ﬁgures: they’re all positive values! SPICE bases its polarities on the
order in which nodes are listed, the ﬁrst node being positive and the second node negative. For
example, a ﬁgure of positive (+) 20 volts between nodes 1 and 2 means that node 1 is positive
with respect to node 2. If the ﬁgure had come out negative in the SPICE analysis, we would
have known that our actual polarity was “backwards” (node 1 negative with respect to node 2).
Checking the node orders in the SPICE listing, we can see that the polarities all match what
we determined through the Branch Current method of analysis.
