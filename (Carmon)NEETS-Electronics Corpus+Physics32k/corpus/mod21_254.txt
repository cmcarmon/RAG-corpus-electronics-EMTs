You should never place a NICAD in your pocket, because metal objects (such as keys) can short the
cell and cause extreme heat. Never dispose of a NICAD by fire, because it can explode. Never solder a
connection directly to the cell, because the heat of an iron can damage it. Never overcharge a NICAD
cell, because an accumulation of gases within its case can destroy it.
