concentrate the flux in the narrow space between the iron core and the pole piece. Current flows into one
hairspring, through the coil, and out the other hairspring. The restoring forces of the spiral springs return
the pointer to the normal zero position when the current through the coil is interrupted. Conductors
connect the hairsprings with the outside terminals of the meter. If the instrument is not DAMPED to
absorb the energy of the moving element, the pointer will oscillate (vibrate) for a period of time before
coming to a stop in its final position. Damping is an energy-absorbing system that prevents this.
