Making insulating systems work satisfactorily under contami-
nated or polluted conditions is critical for maintaining high
reliability of power delivery. This has been accomplished by a
combination of design and a variety of periodic maintenance
procedures, retroﬁts, and product innovation. It is worthwhile
to note that while many situations in service can and have been
dealt with satisfactorily by relatively simple means, others need
a more in-depth analysis and require research and development.
Even a momentary loss of power can cause huge losses to
industrial productivity. Losses incurred depend on the type
of customer affected and the socioeconomic conditions.
For example,
in the United States, a 0.25 sec interruption
to a paper plant can result in a loss of revenue in excess
of $100,000, and this ﬁgure does not include legal liabilities.
Insulators used on overhead lines and in stations are respon-
sible for a signiﬁcant part of factors that cause power outages.
Hence, such interruptions, especially if originating from man-
made causes, should be eliminated.
