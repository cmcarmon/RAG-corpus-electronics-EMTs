Sorting is needed in many applications. For example, for mailing we need addresses in ZIP Code 
order; personnel records may be kept in service number order; and inventory records may be kept in stock 
number order. We could go on and on. Because many of our files are large, sorting is very time 
consuming, and it is one of the processes most used on computer systems. As a user, you will become 
very familiar with this process.
