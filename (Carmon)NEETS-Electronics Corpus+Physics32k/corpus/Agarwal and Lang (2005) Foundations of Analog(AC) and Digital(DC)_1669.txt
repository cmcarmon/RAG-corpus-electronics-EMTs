d) Suppose that the NMOS and CMOS circuits above drive a capacitance CL. Assume
that the on-state resistance of both the PMOS and NMOS transistors is RON. For
both the NMOS and CMOS circuits determine the worst-case output rise time. For
the purpose of this problem, assume that the worst-case output rise time is the time
the output takes to go from 0 V to VH. Sketch the form of the output for both the
NMOS and the CMOS circuit.
