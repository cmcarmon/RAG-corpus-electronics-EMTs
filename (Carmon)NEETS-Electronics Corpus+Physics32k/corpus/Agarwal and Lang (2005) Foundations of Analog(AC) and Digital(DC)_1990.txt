What is Z(s = j1), the impedance of the network at an excitation frequency of one
radian per second?

L = 10 H, R1 = 120 , and R2 = 60 .
e x e r c i s e 13.9 A sinusoidal test signal is applied to a linear network that is
constructed from exactly two circuit elements as shown in Figure 13.68.
The magnitude portion of the Bode plot for the impedance Z( jω) = V( jω)/I( jω) is
shown in Figure 13.69.
