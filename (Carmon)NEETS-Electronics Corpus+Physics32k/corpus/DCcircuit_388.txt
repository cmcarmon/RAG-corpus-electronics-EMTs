The ”resistance” mode of a multimeter is very useful in determining wire continuity as well
as making precise measurements of resistance. When there is a good, solid connection between
the probe tips (simulated by touching them together), the meter shows almost zero Ω. If the
test leads had no resistance in them, it would read exactly zero:
