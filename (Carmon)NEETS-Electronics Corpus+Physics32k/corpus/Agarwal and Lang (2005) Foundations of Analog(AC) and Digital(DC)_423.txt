Interestingly, the significance of potential differences between pairs of
nodes is easily illustrated with the example of a person hanging from a high
voltage line. Although we do not recommend that you try this, a person hang-
ing from a high voltage line is safe as long as no part of their body touches the
ground. However, a deadly current would flow if the person were to touch the
ground or another wire at a different potential.
