Statements in temporal logic are of the form



[
A

]

t




{\displaystyle [A]_{t}}
, where A is an action and t contains a subset of the variables appearing in A. An action is an expression containing primed and non-primed variables, such as



x
+

x
′

∗
y
=

y
′



{\displaystyle x+x'*y=y'}
. The meaning of the non-primed variables is the variable's value in this state. The meaning of primed variables is the variable's value in the next state. The above expression means the value of x today, plus the value of x tomorrow times the value of y today, equals the value of y tomorrow.
The meaning of



[
A

]

t




{\displaystyle [A]_{t}}
is that either A is valid now, or the variables appearing in t do not change. This allows for stuttering steps, in which none of the program variables change their values.
