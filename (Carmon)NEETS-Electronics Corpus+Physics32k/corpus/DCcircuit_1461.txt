• To analyze an RC or L/R circuit more complex than simple series, convert the circuit into
a Thevenin equivalent by treating the reactive component (capacitor or inductor) as the
”load” and reducing everything else to an equivalent circuit of one voltage source and one
series resistor. Then, analyze what happens over time with the universal time constant
formula.
