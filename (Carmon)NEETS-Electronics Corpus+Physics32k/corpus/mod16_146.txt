Voltage measurements may be made as part of either preventive or corrective maintenance. These
measurements are made using a voltmeter. When compared with voltage charts, these measurements are a
valuable aid in locating a trouble quickly and easily. However, if the sensitivity of the test voltmeter
differs from that of the voltmeter used in preparing the chart, the voltage measurements must be evaluated
before the true circuit conditions can be determined. (Sensitivity in voltmeters was discussed in NEETS,
Module 3, Introduction to Circuit Protection, Control, and Measurement.)
