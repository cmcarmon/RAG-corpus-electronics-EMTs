Burnishing can affect initial torque of a coupling but there are also factors that affect the torque performance of a coupling in an application. The main one is voltage/current. In the voltage/current section, it was shown why a constant current supply is important to get full torque out of a coupling.
When considering torque, the question of using dynamic or static torque for the application is key. For example, if a machine is running at a relatively low rpm (5–50 depending upon size) then dynamic torque is not a consideration since the static torque rating of the coupling will come closest to where the application is running. However, if a machine is running at 3,000rpm and the same full torque is required the result will not be the same because of the difference between static and dynamic torques. Almost all manufacturers put the static rated torque for their couplings in their catalog. If a specific response time is needed, the dynamic torque rating for a particular coupling at a given speed is required. In many cases, this can be significantly lower. Sometimes it can be less than ½ of the static torque rating. Most manufacturers publish torque curves showing the relationship between dynamic and static torque for a given series of couplings. (T-1)
