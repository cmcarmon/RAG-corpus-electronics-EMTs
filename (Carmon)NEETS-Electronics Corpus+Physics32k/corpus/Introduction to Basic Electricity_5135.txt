An  isolated  power  supply  is  important 
when powering a circuit, to prevent it from gener-
ating a lethal shock potential. Power supplies are 
available that generate DC voltage and/or AC voltage.  
Both fixed and variable voltage power supplies 
are available. The power supply is used to supply 
a circuit with the correct voltage for testing and 
troubleshooting.
