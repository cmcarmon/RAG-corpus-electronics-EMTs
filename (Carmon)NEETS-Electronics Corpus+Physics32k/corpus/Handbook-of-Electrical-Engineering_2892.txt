The  setting  of  the  reﬂow  proﬁle  is  not  trivial.  It  will  vary  on  whether  the  ﬂux  is  RMA,  water  soluble,  or  no
clean, and it will vary depending on both the mix of low- and high-thermal mass components, and on how
those components are laid out on the board. The proﬁle should exceed the liquidus temperature of the solder
(cid:176)
C. While ﬁnal setting of the proﬁle will depend on actual quality of the solder joints formed
