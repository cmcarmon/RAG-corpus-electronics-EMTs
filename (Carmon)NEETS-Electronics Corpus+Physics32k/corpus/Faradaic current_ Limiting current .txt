The limiting current in electrochemistry is the limiting value of a faradaic current that is approached as the rate of charge-transfer to an electrode is increased . The limiting current can be approached, for example, by increasing the electric potential or decreasing the rate of mass transfer to the electrode. It is independent of the applied potential over a finite range, and is usually evaluated by subtracting the appropriate residual current from the measured total current.A limiting current can have the character of an adsorption, catalytic, diffusion, or kinetic current, and may include a migration current.
