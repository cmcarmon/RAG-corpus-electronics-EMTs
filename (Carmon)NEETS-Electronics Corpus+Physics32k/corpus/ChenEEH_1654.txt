H.26X: Video Compression Standards
The H.26X provides a collection of video compression stand-
ards developed by the ITU-T. The main focus of this effort is to
present standards for videoconferencing applications compat-
ible with the H.310 and H.32X communication network stand-
ards. These communication network standards include video
compression representation, audio compression representa-
tion, multiplexing standards, control standards, and system
standards. The H.26X and MPEG standards are very similar
with relatively minor differences due to the particular require-
ments of the intended applications.
