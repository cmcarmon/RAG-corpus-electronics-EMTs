 1. Before servicing equipment, you should be grounded to discharge any static electricity from your
body. This can be accomplished with the use of a test lead (a single-wire conductor with a series
resistance of 1 megohm) equipped with alligator clips on each end. After the equipment has been
completely de-energized, one clip end is connected to the grounded equipment frame; the other
clip end is touched with your bare hand. Figure 2-6 shows a more refined ground strap, which
frees both hands for work.
