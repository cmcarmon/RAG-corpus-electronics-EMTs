As a ﬁnal check of our work, we can see if the calculated current values add up as they
should to the total. Since R1 and R2 are in parallel, their combined currents should add up
to the total of 120.78 mA. Likewise, since R3 and R4 are in parallel, their combined currents
should also add up to the total of 120.78 mA. You can check for yourself to verify that these
ﬁgures do add up as expected.
