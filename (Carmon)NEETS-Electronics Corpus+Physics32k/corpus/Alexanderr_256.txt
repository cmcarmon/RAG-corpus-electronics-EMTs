As  we  know,  op  amp  circuits  are  modules  or  building  blocks  for
designing  complex  circuits.  It  is  often  necessary  in  practical  applica-
tions to connect op amp circuits in cascade (i.e., head to tail) to achieve
a  large  overall  gain.  In  general,  two  circuits  are  cascaded  when  they
are connected in tandem, one behind another in a single Ô¨Åle.
