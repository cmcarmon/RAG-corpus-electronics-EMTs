modulator varies the voltage of the cathode to produce the modulation envelope. Since the cathode is in 
series with the grid and plate circuits, you should be able see that changing the cathode voltage will 
effectively change the voltage of the other tube elements. By properly controlling the voltages on the 
tube, you can cause the cathode modulator to operate in a form of plate modulation with high efficiency. 
Usually, the cathode modulator is designed to perform about midway between plate and grid modulator 
levels, using the advantages of each type. When operated between the two levels, the modulator provides 
a more linear output with moderate efficiency and a modest audio power requirement.
