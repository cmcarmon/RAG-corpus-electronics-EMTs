inputs are provided to the devices, the discipline also requires the devices to
produce valid output voltages (in a finite amount of time) that satisfy the output
thresholds (VOL and VOH).
We can also refine our combinational gate abstraction to include the notion
of a propagation delay, so that the abstraction remains valid in the presence of
transitioning signals. Recall, the properties of a combinational gate as previously
defined in Chapter 5.3: (1) The gateâ€™s outputs are a function of its inputs alone
and (2) the gate must satisfy the static discipline. In the presence of a finite gate
delay, there is a small period of time following an input transition in which the
outputs do not reflect the new inputs; rather they reflect the old inputs. Thus our
previously defined gate abstraction is violated. We negotiate this inconsistency
by introducing a timing specification into our gate abstraction.
