Knowing the initial trajectory, we can stitch in a sinusoid that decays over
about 5 cycles with the correct initial trajectory. The resulting approximate
sketch is illustrated in Figure 12.56c. Notice that a simple intuitive analysis
allowed us to guess the values of the following parameters of the curve in
Figure 12.56c:
