Note that in general, a and b are chosen to be the smallest
numbers such that H(k) has as large row and column ranks
are possible. Additional suggestions to determine their optimal
values are given in Juang (1994). Let the singular value decom-
position of H(0) be H(0) Â¼ U SV T , and let n denote the index
where the singular values have the largest drop in magnitude.
Then, H(0) can be approximated by:
H(0)  UnSnV T
n ,
