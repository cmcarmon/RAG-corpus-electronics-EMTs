There are two important distinctions concerning the behav-
ior of the electric and magnetic forces in the Lorentz force
equation. First, it is apparent from equation 1.65 that the
electric force F e acts on both moving and stationary charges,
whereas the magnetic force F m acts only on moving charges.
Second, energy is transferred from the electric ﬁeld to the
charged particle, whereas no energy is transferred from the
magnetic ﬁeld to a moving (or stationary) charged particle.
