Symbols and connections 
 
The symbol for an operational amplifier is shown 
in  Fig.  8.2.  There  are  a  few  things  to  note  about 
this. The device has two inputs and one output and 
no  common  connection.  Furthermore,  we  often 
don’t  show  the  supply  connections—it  is  often 
clearer to leave them out of the circuit altogether! 
 
In Fig. 8.2, one of the inputs is marked ‘*’ and 
the  other  is  marked  ‘+’.  These  polarity  markings 
have  nothing  to  do  with  the  supply  connections—
they  indicate  the  overall  phase  shift  between  each 
input  and  the  output.  The  ‘+’  sign  indicates  zero 
phase shift whilst the ‘*’ sign indicates 180° phase 
shift.  Since  180°  phase  shift  produces  an  inverted 
waveform, the ‘*’ input is often referred to as the 
inverting  input. Similarly, the ‘+’ input is known 
as the non-inverting input. 
  Most (but not all) operational amplifiers require 
a symmetrical supply (of typically ±6 V to ±15 V) 
which  allows  the  output  voltage  to  swing  both 
positive  (above  0  V)  and  negative  (below  0  V). 
Figure  8.3  shows  how  the  supply  connections 
would appear if we decided to include them. Note 
that  we  usually  have  two  separate  supplies;  a 
positive supply and an equal, but opposite, negative
