The Galileo spacecraft released a 339-kg probe into Jupiter's atmosphere in 1995. During the parachute-assisted descent, contact with the probe was lost when it overheated. The probe melted in the following hours. The main spacecraft stayed in orbit around Jupiter until 2003 when it was deliberately sent into Jupiter's atmosphere by ground controllers as a measure to prevent forward-contamination of the moon Europa, which may have a subsurface ocean, by any terrestrial microbes and radioactive waste. Lacking its probe's heat shield, it disintegrated upon entry in Jupiter's atmosphere in a matter of seconds.
A projectile released by the Deep Impact probe struck the nucleus of Comet 9P/Tempel on July 4, 2005.
The MESSENGER probe was the first spacecraft to orbit Mercury. It used up all its propellant after four years and crashed into the surface of Mercury on April 30, 2015.
