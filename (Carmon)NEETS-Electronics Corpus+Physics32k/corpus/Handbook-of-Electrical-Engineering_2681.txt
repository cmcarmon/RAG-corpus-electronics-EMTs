Very large scale integrated (VLSI) electronics presents a challenge, not only to those involved in the development
of  fabrication  technology,  but  also  to  computer  scientists,  computer  engineers,  and  electrical  engineers.  The
ways  in  which  digital  systems  are  structured,  the  procedures  used  to  design  them,  the  trade-offs  between
hardware and software, and the design of computational algorithms will all be greatly affected by the coming
changes in integrated electronics.
