Summary
The  LAN  is  the  preferred  method  for  connecting  computers  within  a  customer’s  premises.  A  number  of
transmission media, topologies, data rates, and services are available to meet users’ needs. The services offered
by the LAN are used to implement higher-layer protocols that are required by distributed computing systems.
LANs will continue to grow more capable in the data and bit-error rates they achieve, the functionality they
provide, and the number and geographical span of the stations they support.
