The decoder circuit in Fig. 81.19 requires only 8 IC packages compared to the gate-level circuit in Fig. 81.17
which  requires  18  IC  packages.  Functionally,  both  circuits  perform  the  same.  The  output  equations  for  the
circuit in Fig. 81.19 are the canonical or standard SOP equations for the 0â€™s of the functions OA though OG,
respectively,  represented  by  the  truth  table  (Table  81.4).  The  gates  shown  in  Fig. 81.19  with  more  than  four
inputs are eight-input NAND gates with each unused input tied to VCC via a pull-up resistor (not shown on
the logic diagram).
