Many commercially available sensors (pressure, acceleration, vibration,… etc.) are fabricated from piezoresistive
materials  (see  for  example,  Chapter  56  in  this  handbook.)  The  most  commonly  used  geometry  for  pressure
sensors is the edge clamped diaphragm. Four resistors are usually deposited on the diaphragm and connected
to  form  a  Wheatstone  bridge.  The  deposition  technique  varies  depending  upon  the  piezoresistive  material:
standard  IC  technology  and  micro-machining  for  Si  type  diaphragms;  sputtering  for  thin  ﬁlm  metal  strain
gauges; bonding for wire strain gauges, and screen printing for thick ﬁlm resistors. Different types of diaphragms
(sapphire, metallic, ceramic,… etc.) have been reported in the literature for hybrid sensors.
