Power distribution for rail vehicles ranges from three phase ac, at various voltages (usually collected from
overhead wires), to several different dc voltages (usually collected from a “third rail”). Until recently (within
the past 5 years in the U.S.), most electric traction motors utilized dc power. Today, most traction motors in
new  vehicles  use  ac  power.  Various  techniques  are  used  to  cool  the  motors,  depending  on  the  operating
environment.  Collected  power  is  conditioned  continuously  (see  power “converters”  and “inverters”)  to  meet
the  motors’  requirements  and  the  power  requirements  of  other  vehicle  systems,  and  also  is  stored  to  power
critical on-board systems if power is lost.
