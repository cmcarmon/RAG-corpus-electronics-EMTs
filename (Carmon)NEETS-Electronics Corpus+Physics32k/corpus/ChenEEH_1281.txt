The best way to describe serial-access memory is through an
example. Magnetic tapes, hard disk drives, CD-ROM drives,
and DVD drives are all serial-access memory devices. To access
data on a magnetic tape drive, the tape must be loaded from
the beginning. The magnetic tape head is scanned through the
tape media until the corresponding location is found and data
is accessed. To sum up, the data in serial-access memory must
be accessed in a predetermined fashion (in this example, the
tape is sequentially scanned from the beginning) using shared
read/write devices (e.g., magnetic tape head) for all possible
locations on the media. There are three basic mediums to
implement
serial-access memory devices: magnetic disk
memory, magnetic tape memory, and optical memory.
