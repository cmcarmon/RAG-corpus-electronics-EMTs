Semiconductor diodes were not to be slighted. The initial work of Dr. Carl Zener led to the
development of ZENER DIODE, which is frequently used today to regulate power supply voltages at
precise levels. Considerably more interest in the solid-state diode was generated when Dr. Leo Esaki, a
Japanese scientist, fabricated a diode that could amplify. The device, named the TUNNEL DIODE, has
amazing gain and fast switching capabilities. Although it is used in the conventional amplifying and
oscillating circuits, its primary use is in computer logic circuits.
