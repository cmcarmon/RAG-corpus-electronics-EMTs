where vr /vp is the surface speed ratio between the developer roll (shell) and the PC surface, V the voltage across
the gap Lg, Cm the toner charge-to-mass ratio,  e
0 the permittivity of free space, rc the carrier bead radius, rt
the toner radius, k the dielectric constant of the bulk toner, and dc the thickness of the carrier polymer coating.
Monocomponent development is used almost exclusively for low-end printers because this process does not
require carrier beads, toner concentration sensors or toner replenishment hardware, resulting in much lower
manufacturing costs. This approach has also allowed the use of replaceable toner/developer cartridges which,
although  more  costly  on  a  supplies  cost-per-page  basis,  adds  greatly  to  the  user-perceived  reliability  of  the
system (if it fails—just replace the cartridge!). A rotating donor/development roll with appropriate charging
properties is employed to charge the toner by touch-and-rubbing contacts (see Fig. 89.26). The toner electro-
statically adheres to the donor roll and is transported to contact the PC at the nip. Here, in the presence of a
development bias ﬁeld, the toner is selectively transferred to those areas on the PC with opposite sign charge.
Liquid development employs a high-resistivity hydrocarbon dispersion of very ﬁne toner particles (<1 mm)
that are charged naturally in the solvate. Mechanical means are used to bring the liquid into contact with the
PC, and the toner is then electrophoretically transferred to the latent image areas on the PC.
