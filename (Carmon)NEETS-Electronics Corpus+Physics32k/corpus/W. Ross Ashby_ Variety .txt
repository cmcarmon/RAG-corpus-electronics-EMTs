In An Introduction to Cybernetics, Ashby formulated his Law of Requisite Variety stating that "variety absorbs variety, defines the minimum number of states necessary for a controller to control a system of a given number of states." This law can be applied for example to the number of bits necessary in a digital computer to produce a required description or model.
In response, Conant (1970) produced his so-called "Good Regulator theorem" stating that "every Good Regulator of a System Must be a Model of that System".
Stafford Beer applied variety to found management cybernetics and the Viable System Model. Working independently, Gregory Chaitin followed this with algorithmic information theory.
A popular paraphrasing of the law is "only complexity absorbs complexity". However, while a web search reveals many attributions to Ashby, it appears such attribution is in error. The phrase is not listed by the Cybernetics Society.
