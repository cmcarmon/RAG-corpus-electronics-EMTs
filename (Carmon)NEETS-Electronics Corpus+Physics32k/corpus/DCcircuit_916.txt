If a strip of conductive metal is stretched, it will become skinnier and longer, both changes
resulting in an increase of electrical resistance end-to-end. Conversely, if a strip of conductive
metal is placed under compressive force (without buckling), it will broaden and shorten. If
these stresses are kept within the elastic limit of the metal strip (so that the strip does not
permanently deform), the strip can be used as a measuring element for physical force, the
amount of applied force inferred from measuring its resistance.
