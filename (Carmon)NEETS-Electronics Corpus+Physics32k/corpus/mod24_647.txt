LEDs generally produce light through spontaneous emission when a current is passed through them.
Spontaneous emission is the random generation of photons within the active layer of the LED. The
emitted photons move in random directions. Only a certain percentage of the photons exit the
semiconductor and are coupled into the fiber. Many of the photons are absorbed by the LED materials and
the energy dissipated as heat. This process causes the light output from an LED to be incoherent, have a
broad spectral width, and have a wide output pattern.
