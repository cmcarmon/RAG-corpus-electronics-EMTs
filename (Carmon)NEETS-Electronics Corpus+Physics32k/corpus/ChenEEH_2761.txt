hence, travel slower than c, thereby lagging behind the
causative discontinuities.
3. When S Â¼ 0:99, a weak superluminal response propa-
gates just ahead of the leading edge of the pulse. This is
again due to short-wavelength numerical modes in the
grid generated at the step-function wavefront. These
modes, however have spatial wavelengths even shorter
than those noted in point 2. These are in fact so short
that their grid sampling density drops below the upper
bound for complex wavenumbers and the modes appear
in the superluminal and exponentially decaying regime.
