The last energy level diagram in figure 1-6 is that of a conductor. Notice, there is no forbidden band
or energy gap and the valence and conduction bands overlap. With no energy gap, it takes a small amount
of energy to move electrons into the conduction band; consequently, conductors pass electrons very
easily.
