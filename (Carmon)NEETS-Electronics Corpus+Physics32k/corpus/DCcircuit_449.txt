Since points 1 and 2 are connected together with wire of negligible resistance, as are points
3 and 4, we can say that point 1 is electrically common to point 2, and that point 3 is electrically
common to point 4. Since we know we have 9 volts of electromotive force between points 1 and
4 (directly across the battery), and since point 2 is common to point 1 and point 3 common
to point 4, we must also have 9 volts between points 2 and 3 (directly across the resistor).
Therefore, we can apply Ohm’s Law (I = E/R) to the current through the resistor, because we
know the voltage (E) across the resistor and the resistance (R) of that resistor. All terms (E, I,
R) apply to the same two points in the circuit, to that same resistor, so we can use the Ohm’s
Law formula with no reservation.
