Incoherent Light
When two or more incoherent light beams are combined, the resulting light ﬂux is the sum of their energies.
For coherent light this is not necessarily true and the resulting light intensity depends on the phase relationships
between the electric ﬁelds of the two beams, as well as the degree of coherence.
