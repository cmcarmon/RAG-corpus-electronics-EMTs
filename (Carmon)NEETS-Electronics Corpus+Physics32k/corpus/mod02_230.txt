The ceramic capacitor is color coded as shown in figure 3-23 and the mica capacitor as shown in figure
3-24. Notice that this type of mica capacitor differs from the one shown in figure 3-21 in that the arrow is
solid instead of broken. This type of mica capacitor is read in the same manner as the one shown in figure
3-21, with one exception: the first dot indicates the first digit. (Note: Because this type of capacitor is always
mica, there is no need for a type dot.)
