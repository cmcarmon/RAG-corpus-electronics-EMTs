The use of the B time base is controlled by the HORIZ DISPLAY section discussed earlier in the A
time-base section. However, inexperienced technicians generally do not use A and B time bases together
in the MIXED, A INTEN (intensified), and B D'LYD (delayed) settings. These controls are fully
explained in the applicable technical manuals; therefore, we will not discuss the controls in this chapter.
