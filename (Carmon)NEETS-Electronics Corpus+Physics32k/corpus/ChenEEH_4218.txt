High-Speed Ethernet-Like LAN
When an ethernet LAN has the speed of 100 Mbps or higher, it
is classiﬁed as a high-speed ethernet LAN. The high-speed
ethernet-like LAN is a natural evolution of low-speed tra-
ditional 10-Mbps LAN. IEEE speciﬁed two standards: 100BASE-
T and 100VG-AnyLAN. Table 6.2 provides a comparison be-
tween 100BASE-T and 100VG-AnyLAN
