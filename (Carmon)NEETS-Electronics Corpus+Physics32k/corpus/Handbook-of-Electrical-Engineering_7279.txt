Personal  Communications  Services  (PCS)  promise  to  introduce  a  wide  range  of  variety  of  digital  wireless
services; including high-speed data, improved voice services, and messaging (e-mail or paging). These services
are also often identiÔ¨Åed with the part of the spectrum in which they are deployed, that is, the PCS band. In
North America, this part of the spectrum lies between 1850 and 1990 MHz, and is divided into six blocks of
either  5  or  15  MHz  each.  The  Federal  Communications  Commission  (FCC)  of  the  United  States  has  been
auctioning these blocks since 1994. The DCS (Digital Cellular System) band, which also spans the range of 1.8
to 2 GHz, has been set aside for these advanced services in several parts of the world.
