Following is a sampling of some of NASA's past and present programs excluding manned spacecraft. The years in brackets are for first and latest launching. A program is a number of flights or missions with the same kind of spacecraft, therefore the name of the program and the name of the spacecraft used will often be the same. In all, NASA have made more than 1,000 unmanned missions into Earth orbit or beyond.
