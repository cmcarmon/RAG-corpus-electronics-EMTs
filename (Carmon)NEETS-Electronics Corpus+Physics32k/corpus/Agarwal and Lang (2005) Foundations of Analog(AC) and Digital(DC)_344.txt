We now have ten independent equations (Equations 2.110 through 2.119)
and ten unknowns: five voltages and five currents. Thus the equations can
be solved for any variable by simple algebra. To find i4, for example, we can
first substitute the constituent relations, Equations 2.110 through 2.114 into
Equations 2.115 and 2.116:
