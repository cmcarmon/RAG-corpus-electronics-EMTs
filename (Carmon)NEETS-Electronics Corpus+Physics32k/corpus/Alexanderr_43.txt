1. Carefully deﬁne the problem. This may be the most important part
of the process, because it becomes the foundation for all the rest of the
steps. In general, the presentation of engineering problems is somewhat
incomplete. You must do all you can to make sure you understand the
problem as thoroughly as the presenter of the problem understands it.
Time spent at this point clearly identifying the problem will save you
considerable time and frustration later. As a student, you can clarify a
problem statement in a textbook by asking your professor. A problem
presented to you in industry may require that you consult several indi-
viduals. At  this  step,  it  is  important  to  develop  questions  that  need  to
be addressed before continuing the solution process. If you have such
questions,  you  need  to  consult  with  the  appropriate  individuals  or
resources to obtain the answers to those questions. With those answers,
you can now reﬁne the problem, and use that reﬁnement as the prob-
lem statement for the rest of the solution process.
