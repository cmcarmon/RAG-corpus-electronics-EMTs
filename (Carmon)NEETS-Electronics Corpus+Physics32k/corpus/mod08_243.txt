The tuned circuits formed by the transformer and capacitors may not have the bandwidth required for
the amplifier. In other words, the bandwidth of the tuned circuit may be too "narrow" for the requirements
of the amplifier. (For example, the rf amplifiers used in television receivers usually require a bandwidth
of 6 MHz.)
