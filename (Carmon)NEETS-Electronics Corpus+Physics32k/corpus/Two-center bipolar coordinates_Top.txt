In mathematics, two-center bipolar coordinates is a coordinate system, based on two coordinates which give distances from two fixed centers,

{\displaystyle c_{1}}
and




c

{\displaystyle c_{2}}
. This system is very useful in some scientific applications (e.g. calculating the electric field of a dipole on a plane).
