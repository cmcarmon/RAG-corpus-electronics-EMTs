The 555 bistable multivibrator shown in Figure 11-18 produces alternating high 
(VCC) and low (0 V) voltages, switching from one state to the other only when 
triggered. Such a circuit is commonly known as a flip‐flop. There’s no need to 
calculate resistor values; activating the trigger switch controls the timing of 
the pulses generated.
