Classical ITC is a typical thermodynamic technique allowing to measure directly the heat evolved during a reaction that can be described by:
A + B ↔ C (1)
At constant pressure, the heat evolved during the formation of one mole of the product C is nothing else than ΔH, the molar variation of enthalpy of the reaction. By considering a titration experiment during which small amounts of the compound B are injected at regular intervals into a measurement cell containing the compound A, one can determine the equilibrium constant Ka of the reaction (in M−1) or, equivalently, the dissociation constant Kd = Ka−1 (in M). From this, the standard Gibbs free energy of the reaction may be obtained:
ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS° = RT lnKd (2)
and thus also ΔS° = (ΔH° - ΔG° )/T. As important the four quantities ΔH°, ΔG°, ΔS° and Kd may be, particularly for drug design, it is important to emphasize that they are typical thermodynamic quantities that do not say anything about the kinetics of the reaction.
