Symbol  error  rate: A  fundamental  performance  measure  for  digital  communication  systems.  The  symbol
error rate is estimated as the number of errors divided by the total number of demodulated symbols.
When the communication system is ergodic, this is equivalent to the probability of making a demodu-
lation error on any symbol.
