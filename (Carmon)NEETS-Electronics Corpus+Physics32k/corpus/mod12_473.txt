At the quadrature grid the voltage across C3 lags the current which produces it [view (C)]. The result
is a series of pulses, shown in view (D), appearing on the quadrature grid at the center frequency, but
lagging the limiter-grid voltage by 90 degrees. Because the quadrature grid has the same conduction and
cutoff levels as the limiter grid, the resultant current waveform will be transformed into a square wave.
