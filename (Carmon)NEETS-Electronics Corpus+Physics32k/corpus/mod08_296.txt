For the purpose of examining the operation of the circuit shown in figure 3-2, assume that the circuit
has a gain of -10. This means that for each 1-volt change in the base-to-emitter bias, there would be a
10-volt change in the output signal. Assume, also, that the input signals will peak at 1-volt levels (+1 volt
for the positive peak and -1 volt for the negative peak). The secret to understanding this circuit (or any
transistor amplifier circuit) is to realize that the collector current is controlled by the base-to-emitter bias.
In other words, in this circuit the output signal (the voltage developed across R3) is determined by the
difference between the voltage on the base and the voltage on the emitter.
