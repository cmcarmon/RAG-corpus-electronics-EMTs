1. A new problem is analyzed and represented in the form
such that the system can retrieve relevant past cases
from its memory. A past case is appropriate if it has the
potential to provide a solution to the new problem.
Typically, heuristics are used to choose cases similar to
the new problem based on certain similarity measures.
2. A retrieved case is modiÔ¨Åed so that it is applicable to
the new problem. Analytic methods or heuristic
methods are applied to transform the stored solution
into operations suitable to the new problem.
