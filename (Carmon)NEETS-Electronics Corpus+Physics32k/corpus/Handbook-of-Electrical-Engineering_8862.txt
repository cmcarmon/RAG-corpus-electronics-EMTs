The cache is intended to hold the most active portions of the memory, and the hardware dynamically selects
portions of main memory to store in the cache. When the cache is full, bringing in new data must be matched
by deleting old data. Thus a strategy for cache management is necessary. Cache management strategies exploit
the principle of locality. Spatial locality is exploited by the choice of what is brought into the cache. Temporal
locality  is  exploited  in  the  choice  of  which  block  is  removed. When  a  cache  miss  occurs,  hardware  copies  a
large, contiguous block of memory into the cache, which includes the word requested. This Ô¨Åxed-size region
, may be as small as a single word, or up to several hundred bytes.

A block is a set of contiguous memory locations, the number of which is usually a power of two. A block is
 if the lowest address in the block is exactly divisible by the block size. That is to say, for a
