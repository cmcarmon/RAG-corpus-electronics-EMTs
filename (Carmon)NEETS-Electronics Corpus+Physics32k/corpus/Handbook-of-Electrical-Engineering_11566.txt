Rehabilitation engineers and their colleagues have designed other ways to read text. To replace the retina as
a sensor element, a modern high-resolution, high-sensitivity, fast-imaging sensor (CCD, etc.) is employed to
capture a visual image of the text. One method, used by various page scanning devices, converts the scanned
image to text by using optical character recognition schemes, and then outputs the text as speech via text-to-
speech algorithms. This machine essentially recites the text, much as a sighted helper might do when reading
aloud  to  the  blind  individual.  The  user  of  the  device  is  thus  freed  of  the  absolute  need  for  a  helper.  Such
