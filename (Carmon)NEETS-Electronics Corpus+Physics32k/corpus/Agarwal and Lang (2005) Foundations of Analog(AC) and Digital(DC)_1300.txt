In the following subsections, we will consider specific examples of the
source current I and source voltage V. However, before doing so, it is worth
noting the similarity between the analyses of the four circuits we have just
studied. Because capacitors and inductors are duals of each other, we find
that the circuits are as well. For example, the circuits shown in Figures 9.31
and 9.33 are duals. Capacitance interchanges with inductance, and current
interchanges with voltage, as can be seen by comparing Equations 9.63 and
9.65. Similarly, the circuits shown in Figures 9.32 and 9.34 are duals. Again,
capacitance interchanges with inductance and current interchanges with voltage,
as can be seen by comparing Equations 9.64 and 9.66.
