An autonomous system is a system of ordinary differential equations of the form






d

d
t



x
(
t
)
=
f
(
x
(
t
)
)


{\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dt}}x(t)=f(x(t))}

where x takes values in n-dimensional Euclidean space and t is usually time.
It is distinguished from systems of differential equations of the form

(

=

(

,

)


{\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dt}}x(t)=g(x(t),t)}

in which the law governing the rate of motion of a particle depends not only on the particle's location, but also on time; such systems are not autonomous.
