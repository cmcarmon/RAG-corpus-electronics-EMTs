That it is difÔ¨Åcult to stimulate the heart with a pulse of eddy current can be assessed by the parameters of
the stimulator used by Bourland et al. [1990] which employed a 682 mF capacitor, charged to 9900 volts, and
discharged into the 220 mH coplanar coil assembly. The peak current was 17,000 amps and the stored energy
was  33,421  joules.  The  duration  of  the  induced  current  pulse  was  690  msec.  This  stimulator  was  used  by
Mouchawar  et  al.  [1992],  who  reported  mean  current  and  energy  thresholds  for  cardiac  stimulation  in  the
range of 9200 amps and 11,850 joules.
