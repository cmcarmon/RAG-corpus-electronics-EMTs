In this section, we compare frequency domain versus time domain analysis using
the compensated attenuator (or compensated voltage divider) as an example.
The simple voltage dividers discussed in Section 2.3.4 do not work very well at
high frequencies. In most circuits, some parasitic shunt capacitance is present,
represented in Figure 13.45a by capacitor C2. If the drive is a low-frequency sine
wave, the attenuation of the voltage divider is R2/(R1 + R2) as expected, but at
high frequencies the capacitance causes the attenuation to increase beyond this
desired value. This effect can be readily shown by a frequency domain analysis
of the voltage divider.
