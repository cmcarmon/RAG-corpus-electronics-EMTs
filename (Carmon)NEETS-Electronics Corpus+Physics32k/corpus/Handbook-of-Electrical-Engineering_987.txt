In Step 1 VT0, U0, and THETA are deﬁned in the model for a wide-long device at zero back-bias. They are
zero-order fundamental parameters without any short or narrow channel corrections. We therefore ﬁt them to
a  wide-long  device.  It  is  absolutely  necessary  that  such  a  device  be  on  the  test  chip. Without  it,  one  cannot
obtain these parameters properly. The subthreshold region must be avoided also because these parameters do
not control the model behavior in subthreshold.
