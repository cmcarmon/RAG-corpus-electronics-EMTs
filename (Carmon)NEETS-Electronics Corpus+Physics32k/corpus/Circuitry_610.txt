Figure  13.12  shows  the  circuit  of  a  typical  RF 
amplifier stage (this circuit can also be used as an 
IF amplifier in a superhet receiver). You might like 
to contrast this circuit with Fig. 7.34 shown on page 
145. The amplifier operates in Class A and uses a 
small-signal NPN transistor connected in common-
emitter mode. The essential difference between the 
circuit shown in Fig. 13.12 and that shown in Fig. 
7.34  is  that  the  RF  amplifier  uses  a  parallel  tuned 
circuit as a collector load.
