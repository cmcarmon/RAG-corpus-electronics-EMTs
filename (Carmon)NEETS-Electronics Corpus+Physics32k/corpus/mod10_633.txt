The horizontal and vertical axes are at a right angle to each other. The point where the axes cross 
each other is known as the ORIGIN. In this case, the origin is 0 on both axes. Now, assume that a 
radiation value of 7 units view B is measured at position 2. From position 2 on the horizontal axis, a 
dotted line is projected upwards that runs parallel to the vertical axis. From position 7 on the vertical axis, 
a line is projected to the right that runs parallel to the horizontal axis. The point where the two lines cross 
(INTERCEPT) represents a value of 7 radiation units at position 2. This is the only point on the graph that 
can represent this value.
