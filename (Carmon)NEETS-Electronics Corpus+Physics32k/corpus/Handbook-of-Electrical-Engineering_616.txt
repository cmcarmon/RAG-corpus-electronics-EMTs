In  a  conventional  digital  modulation  scheme,  the  analog  sample  function  of  duration T  that  represents  a
symbol is a linear combination of periodic, orthogonal basis functions (e.g., a sine and a cosine, or sinusoids at
different frequencies), and the symbol duration T is an integer multiple of the period of the basis functions.
In a chaotic digital communications system, shown schematically in Fig. 5.23, the analog sample function of
