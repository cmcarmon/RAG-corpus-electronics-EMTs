There is, however, a limit to the ﬁeld current increase. It is known that superconductivity and diamagnetism
are closely related; that is, if a material is in the superconducting state, no magnetic lines of force can enter its
interior. Increasing the current produces more and more magnetic lines of force, and this can continue until
the  dense  magnetic  ﬁeld  can  penetrate  the  material. When  this  happens,  the  material  fails  to  stay  supercon-
ductive, and therefore resistive loss can take place. In other words, a material can stay superconductive until a
certain  critical  ﬁeld  strength  is  reached.  The  critical  ﬁeld  strength  is  dependent  on  the  material  and  its
temperature.
