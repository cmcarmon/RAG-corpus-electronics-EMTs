g. Precision timing and position location (GPS). Navigation/position location historically is important and
becomes more so in high dynamic maneuver warfare. With the introduction of the Global Positioning
System (GPS), 3-dimensional positioning is available to the smallest of high-mobility nodes. Even with
a less than complete satellite constellation, position accuracies can become less than 100 m.
