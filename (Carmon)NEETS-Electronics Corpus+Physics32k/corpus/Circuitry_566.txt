For  any  particular  monostable  timing  period,  the 
required values for C and R can be determined from 
the  formula  shown  earlier  or  by  using  the  graph 
shown in Fig. 12.5.  The output period can be easily 
adjusted by making R a preset resistor with a value 
of about twice that of the calculated value.
