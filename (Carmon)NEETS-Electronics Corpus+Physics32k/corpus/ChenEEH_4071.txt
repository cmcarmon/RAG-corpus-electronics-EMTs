In Figure 2.8, each pulse is expressed as a level from a ﬁnite
number of predetermined levels; each such level can be repre-
sented by a symbol from a ﬁnite alphabet. The pulses in Figure
2.8 are called quantized samples. When the sample values are
quantized to a ﬁnite set, this format can interface with a digital
system. After quantization, the analog waveform can still be
recovered but not precisely; improved reconstruction ﬁdelity
of the analog waveform can be achieved by increasing the
number of quantization levels (requiring increased system
bandwidth).
