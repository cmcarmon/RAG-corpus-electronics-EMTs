The methods and tools described in this subsection are
speciﬁc to particular application domains. A general approach
for producing domain-speciﬁc compilers is advocated by Men-
cer et al. (2001). Their approach was based on the use of
object-oriented module generators for developing compilers
that target domain-speciﬁc implementations, such as stream
architectures and Boolean satisﬁability machines.
