The Neyman-Pearson detector is known to be the most
powerful detector for the problem of detecting a constant signal
in noise. One advantage of the Neyman-Pearson detector is that
its implementation does not require explicit knowledge of the
prior probabilities and costs of decisions. However, as is the case
for Bayesâ€™ detector, evaluation of the likelihood ratio still re-
quires exact knowledge of the pdf of X under both hypotheses.
