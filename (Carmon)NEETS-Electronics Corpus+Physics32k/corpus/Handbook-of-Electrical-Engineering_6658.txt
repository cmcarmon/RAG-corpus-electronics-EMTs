The end results of the ARPA networking effort, its derivatives, and the early initiatives of many companies
such as AT&T, DATAPOINT, DEC, IBM, and NCR have been far-reaching in the extreme. Any Ô¨Ånitely delimited
discussion of the accomplishments of those efforts would appear to underestimate their impact on our lives.
We will concentrate on the most visible product of these efforts, which is a collection of programs that allows
applications  running  in  different  computers  to  intercommunicate.  Before  turning  to  our  discussion  of  the
software, however, we will provide a brief description of a generic computer communication network.
