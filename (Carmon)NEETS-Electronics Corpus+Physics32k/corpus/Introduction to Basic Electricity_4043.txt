An astable	multivibrator is one type of free-
running  multivibrator.  The  output  of  an  astable 
 multivibrator is rectangular. By varying the RC time 
constants of the coupling circuits, rectangular pulses 
of any desired width can be obtained. By changing 
the values of the resistor and capacitor, the operating 
 frequency can be changed. The frequency stability
