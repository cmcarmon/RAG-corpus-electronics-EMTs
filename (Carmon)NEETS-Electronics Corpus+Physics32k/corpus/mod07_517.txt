Now, study figure 4-35. Voltages are shown to help you understand how the regulator operates. The 
Zener used in this regulator is a 15-volt Zener. In this instance the Zener or breakdown voltage is 15 volts. 
The Zener establishes the value of the base voltage for Q1. The output voltage will equal the Zener 
voltage minus a 0.7-volt drop across the forward biased base-emitter junction of Q1, or 14.3 volts. 
Because the output voltage is 14.3 volts, the voltage drop across Q1 must be 5.7 volts.
