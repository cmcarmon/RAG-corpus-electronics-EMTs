Detectors and mixers use the nonlinear property of devices to
achieve frequency conversion. Either diodes or transistors can
be used for this purpose. A detector produces a dc signal
whose amplitude varies in proportion to the amplitude of an
applied RF signal. They are often used in power sensors and
test equipment. A detector can also be used to demodulate
information on a modulated RF signal. Mixers are used for
both up-conversion in transmitters and down-conversion in
receivers. A mixer is a circuit with two input ports for the RF
and local oscillator (LO) signals and an output port for the
intermediate frequency (IF) signal.
