There are many other features that need to be considered, such as whether the algorithm uses symmetrical
components or phase coordinates, or whether it is single- or three-phase. Data entry for single-phase typically
requires the electrical parameters, whereas three-phase analysis normally requires the physical geometry of the
overhead transmission lines and cables and conductor details so that a transmission line parameter program
or cable parameter program can calculate the line or cable electrical parameters.
