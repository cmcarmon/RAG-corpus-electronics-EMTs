The class of plants of equation 12.1 is, to our knowledge,
the most general class of systems considered so far within the
context of adaptive control based on back-stepping. In par-
ticular, in Krstic´ et al. (1995), which are indirect adaptive
approaches, the input functions cj
i are assumed to be constant
for i ¼ 1, . . ., n. This assumption allows the authors of those
works to perform a simpler stability analysis, which becomes
more complex in the general case (Ordon˜ez and Passino,
the interpolation functions rj,
2001). The addition of
j ¼ 1, . . ., R also extends the class of strict feedback systems
to one including systems with a time-varying structure (Ordo-
n˜ez and Passino, 2000a) as well as systems falling in the
domain of gain scheduling (where the plant dynamics are
identiﬁed at different operating points and then interpolated
between using a scheduling variable). Note that if we let R ¼ 1
i ¼ 1, i ¼ 1, . . ., n, we
and r1(y) ¼ 1 for all y, together with cc
have the particular case considered in Polycarpou (1996) and
Polycarpou and Mears (1998).
