signal generators are used in the testing and 
aligning of radio transmitters, receivers, and ampli-
fiers. They are also used for troubleshooting various 
electronic devices that require an input signal. Signal 
generators produce an alternating voltage of a desired 
frequency and amplitude for testing or measuring a 
circuit. They are classified by their frequency into the 
following categories: audio generator, video signal 
generator, radio-frequency (RF) generator, frequency-
modulated (FM) RF generators, and special types of 
signal generators that combine several or all of the 
 frequency ranges.
