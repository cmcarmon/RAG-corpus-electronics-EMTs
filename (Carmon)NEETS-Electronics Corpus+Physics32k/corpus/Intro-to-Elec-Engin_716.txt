Ampliﬁers are circuits that produce an output signal which is larger than, but proportional to,
an input signal. The input and output signals can be both voltages or currents, or one or the
other, as in voltage-in current-out and current-in voltage-out ampliﬁers. The ampliﬁer gain is
just the network’s transfer function, which is the ratio of output-to-input complex signals in the
frequency domain as found by complex analysis. Ampliﬁers ﬁnd extensive use in instrumentation
applications. Sometimes, ampliﬁers are used for reasons other than gain alone. An ampliﬁer may
be designed to have high input impedance so that it does not affect the output of a sensor while at
the same time giving a low output impedance so that it can drive large currents into its load, such
as a lamp or heating element. In some other applications, an ampliﬁer with a low input impedance
might be desirable.
