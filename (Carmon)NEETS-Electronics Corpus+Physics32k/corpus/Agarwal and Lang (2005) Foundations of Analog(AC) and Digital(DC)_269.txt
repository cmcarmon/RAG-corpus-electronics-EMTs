difference between the two nodes. The potential difference between two nodes
is the sum of the potential differences for the set of branches along any path
between the two nodes. For a loop, the start and end nodes are one and the
same, and there cannot be a potential difference between a node and itself.
Thus, since potential differences equate to voltages, the sum of branch volt-
ages along a loop must equal zero. By the same reasoning, since the voltage
between any pair of nodes must be unique,
it must be independent of the
path along which branch voltages are added. Notice from the definition of a
voltage that KVL is simply an expression of the principle of conservation of
energy.
