Common Base Ampliﬁer
A second canonic cell of linear BJT ampliﬁers is the common base ampliﬁer, whose ac circuit schematic diagram
appears in Fig. 28.16(a). In this diagram, RST, VST, RLT, and VOS retain the signiﬁcance they respectively have
in the previously considered common emitter conﬁguration. Note that in the common base orientation, the
input signal is applied to the base, while the resultant small signal voltage response is extracted at the collector
of a transistor.
