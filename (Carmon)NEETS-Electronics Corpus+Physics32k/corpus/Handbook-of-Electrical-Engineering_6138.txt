In order to obtain the electrical parameters of overhead transmission lines and underground cables, utility
programs  have  been  developed.  Transmission  line  parameter  programs  use  the  physical  geometry  of  the
conductors, the conductor type, and ground resistivity to calculate the electrical parameters of the line. Cable
parameter programs use the physical dimensions of the cable, its construction, and its position in the ground.
The results of these programs are usually fed directly to network analysis programs such as load ï¬‚ow or faults.
The danger of errors introduced during transfer are thus minimized. This is particularly true for three-phase
analyses due to the volume of data involved.
