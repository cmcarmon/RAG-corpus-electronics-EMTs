In order for electrons to ﬂow through a conductor, there must be a voltage present to moti-
vate them. Voltage, as you should recall, is always relative between two points. There is no such
thing as voltage ”on” or ”at” a single point in the circuit, and so the bird contacting a single
point in the above circuit has no voltage applied across its body to establish a current through
it. Yes, even though they rest on two feet, both feet are touching the same wire, making them
electrically common. Electrically speaking, both of the bird’s feet touch the same point, hence
there is no voltage between them to motivate current through the bird’s body.
