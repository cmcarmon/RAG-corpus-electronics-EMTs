The terms in the matrix H(·) contain all the terms associated with the centripetal and Coriolis forces. The
terms that depend upon the square of the joint velocity are centripetal forces. The terms that contain the product
·q2
of joint velocities are Coriolis forces. In our example, the term –(m2l1l2sin q2)
2 represents the centripetal force
·q1
acting  at  joint 1  due  to  the  velocity  at  joint 2.  Similarly,  the  term  (m2l1l2 sin q2)
2 represents  the  centripetal
·q2 is the Coriolis force acting
·q1
force acting at joint 2 due to the velocity at joint 1. The term –(2m2l1l2 sin q2)
at joint 2 due to the velocities at joints 1 and 2.
