Factors other than computational burden must be con-
sidered in choosing between the two general methods. Stability
of the solution, for example, can be an important consider-
ation. The autocorrelation solution is theoretically guaranteed
to represent a stable ﬁlter if inﬁnite precision arithmetic is
used. In practice, the L-D recursion contains a built-in check
