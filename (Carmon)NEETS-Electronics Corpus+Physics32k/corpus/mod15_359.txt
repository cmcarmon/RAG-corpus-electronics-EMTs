The erection system used in many horizontal gyros is very similar to the vertical gyro system just 
discussed. It is called the mercury ballistic erection system. The mercury ballistic system has the added 
feature of maintaining the spin axis not only in the horizontal plane, but also with the spin axis aligned 
North-South.
