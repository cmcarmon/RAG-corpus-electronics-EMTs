The nonlinear differential equations of 13.45 and 13.48 are
numerically solved by a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. This
model provides four state variables: (1) x(t ), position of the cart
on the track; (2) u(t), angle of the pole with respect to the vertical
position; (3) _xx(t), cart velocity; and (4) u(t), angular velocity.
