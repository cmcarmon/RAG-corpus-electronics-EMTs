phases  of  products  and  systems.  Increasing  emphasis  being  placed  on  quality  of  components  and  systems,
coupled with pressures to minimize cost and increase value, further emphasize the need to study, understand,
quantify, and predict reliability and arrive at innovative designs and operational and maintenance procedures.
From  the  electrical  engineering  point  of  view,  two  (among  several)  areas  that  have  received  signiﬁcant
attention are electronic equipment (including computer hardware) and electric power systems. Other major
areas  include  communication  systems  and  software  engineering. As  the  complexity  of  electronic  equipment
grew during and after World War II and as the consequences of failures in the ﬁeld became more and more
apparent, the U.S. military became seriously involved, promoted the formation of groups, and became instru-
mental in the development of the earliest handbooks and speciﬁcations. The great northeast blackout in the
U.S. in November 1965 triggered the serious application of reliability concepts in the power systems area.
