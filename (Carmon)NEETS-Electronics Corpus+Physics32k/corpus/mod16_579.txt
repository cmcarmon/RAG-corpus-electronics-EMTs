When the electrons leave the electrostatic field, they will take a straight path to the screen at the
angle at which they left the field. Because they were all deflected equally, the electrons will be traveling
toward the same spot. Of course, the proper voltages must exist on the anodes to produce the electrostatic
field. Changing these voltages changes the focal point of the beam and causes the electron beam to strike
the CRT at a different point.
