It is mainly a matter of point of view. Emulation and simulation are essentially the same process but viewed
from different levels. Realizing a 64-bit addition and implementing a communication controller are qualitatively
the same type of task. Once this is considered, there are theoretically no limits to the uses of microprogramming.
From  the  programmer’s  point  of  view,  programming  is  the  activity  of  producing,  in  some  language,  an
implementation  of  some  algorithm.  If  the  language  is  at  the  very  lowest  level,  as  is  the  case  with  micropro-
gramming, and at the same time the algorithm is ﬁlled with intricate data structures and complex decisions,
the  task  might  be  enormous,  but  nothing  says  it  cannot  be  done  (except,  maybe,  experience).  With  this
perspective of the ﬁeld, we now look at some existing applications of microprogramming.
