Figure 3-15 shows a method of restraining the precession of a gyro to permit the calculation of an 
angle. Springs have been attached to the crossarm of the output shaft. These springs restrain the free 
precession of the gyro. The gyro may use other types of restraint, but no matter what type of restraint is 
used, the gyro is harnessed to produce some useful work.
