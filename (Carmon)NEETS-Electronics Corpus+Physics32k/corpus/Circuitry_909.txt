The  student  assignments  provided  here  have  been 
designed  to  support  the  topics  introduced  in  this 
book.  They  can  also  be  used  to  satisfy  the 
assessment requirements of a taught course. Please 
note  that  the  assignments  are  not  exhaustive  and 
may  need  modification  to  meet  an  individual 
awarding bodyâ€™s requirements as well as the locally 
available resources. The first 10 assignments satisfy 
the  requirements  for  the  level  2  courses  while  the 
remaining 12 are designed to meet the requirements 
of  level  3  courses.  Assignments  can  normally  be 
carried  out  in  three  to  five  hours,  including 
analysis, report writing and evaluation.
