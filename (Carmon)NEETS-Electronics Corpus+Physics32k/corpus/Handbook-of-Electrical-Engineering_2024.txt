  hearing  aids.  Analog  hearing  aids
contain only (low-power) pre-amp, ﬁlter(s), (optional) automatic gain control (AGC) or compressor, power
amp, and output limiter. Digitally controlled aids have certain additional components: one kind adds a digital
controller to monitor and adjust the analog components of the aid. Another kind contains switched-capacitor
circuits that represent sampled signals in analog form, in effect allowing simple discrete-time processing (e.g.,
ﬁltering).  Aids  with  switched-capacitor  circuits  have  a  lower  power  consumption  compared  to  digital  aids.
Digital aids—none are yet commercially available—contain A/D and D/A converters and at least one program-
mable  digital  signal  processing  (DSP)  chip,  allowing  for  the  use  of  sophisticated  DSP  algorithms,  (small)
microphone arrays, speech enhancement in noise, etc. Experts disagree, however, as to the usefulness of these
techniques. To date, the most successful approach seems to be to ensure that all parts of the signal get ampliﬁed
so that they are clearly audible but not too loud and to “let the brain sort out signal and noise.”
