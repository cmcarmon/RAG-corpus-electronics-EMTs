Crucial in our methodology is that the code transformations
have to be applied globally (i.e., with the entire algorithm as
scope). This is in contrast with most existing loop transform-
ation research for which the scope is limited to one procedure
or even one loop nest. This application can enhance the local-
ity in that loop nest, but it does not solve the global data ï¬‚ow
and associated buffer space needed between the loop nests or
procedures. To allow these global transformations, a step has
to be taken before the application is partitioned over different
HW/SW components.
