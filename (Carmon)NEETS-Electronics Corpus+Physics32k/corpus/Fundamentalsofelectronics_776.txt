Interference represents man-made signals. Telephone lines are subject to power-line interference (in
the United States a distorted 60 Hz sinusoid). Cellular telephone channels are subject to adjacent-cell phone
conversations using the same signal frequency. The problem with such interference is that it occupies the
same frequency band as the desired communication signal, and has a similar structure.
