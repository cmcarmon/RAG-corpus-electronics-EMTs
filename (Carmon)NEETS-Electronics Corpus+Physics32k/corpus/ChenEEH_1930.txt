sumer products. Recent increases in speed and size (of the
order of 300-MHz and 1-M gates) will expand this trend
further. FPGAs have also found use in mission- and life-critical
applications (e.g., the 1996 Mars Pathﬁnder mission) (Lach et
al., 1998). FPGAs form the core of adaptive computing plat-
forms used in aircraft avionics, in which the FPGA hardware is
rapidly reconﬁgured in run time to map the desired applica-
tion to the platform. Current technology trends for FPGA
devices are in the deep-submicron (DSM) regime with recent
chips using 90 nanometer and seven metal layers. This trend,
however, has also resulted in a decrease of fabrication yield
(due to the extreme accuracy requirement of the process tech-
nology resulting in low error margins) as well as decreased
reliability in operation (stemming, for example, from greater
risk of electromigration and increased susceptibility to ionized
