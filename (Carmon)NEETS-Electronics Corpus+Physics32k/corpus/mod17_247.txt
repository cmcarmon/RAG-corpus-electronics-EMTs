Our circuit uses two separate diodes; one is the detector diode and the other the agc diode. The agc
diode is connected to the primary of the last IF transformer and the detector diode to its secondary. A
positive bias is applied to the cathode of the agc diode. This keeps it from conducting until a prearranged
signal level has been reached. The adjust delay control allows manual control of the agc diode bias.
Manual control allows you to select the signal level at which agc is applied. If mostly weak stations are to
