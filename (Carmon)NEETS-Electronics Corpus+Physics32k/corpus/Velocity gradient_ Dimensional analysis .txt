By performing dimensional analysis, the dimensions of velocity gradient can be determined. The dimensions of velocity are




M

0



L

1



T

−
1




{\displaystyle M^{0}L^{1}T^{-1}}
, and the dimensions of distance are




M

0



L

1



T

0




{\displaystyle M^{0}L^{1}T^{0}}
. Since the velocity gradient can be expressed as






Δ
v
e
l
o
c
i
t
y


Δ
d
i
s
t
a
n
c
e





{\displaystyle {\frac {\Delta velocity}{\Delta distance}}}
. Therefore, the velocity gradient has the same dimensions as this ratio, i.e.




M

0



L

0



T

−
1




{\displaystyle M^{0}L^{0}T^{-1}}
.
