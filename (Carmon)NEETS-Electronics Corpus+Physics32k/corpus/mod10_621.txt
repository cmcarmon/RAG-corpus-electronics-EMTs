Radiation is somewhat less affected by reflections from aircraft flying over the transmission path 
when vertical polarization is used instead of horizontal polarization. With horizontal polarization, such 
reflections cause variations in received signal strength. This factor is important in locations where aircraft 
traffic is heavy.
