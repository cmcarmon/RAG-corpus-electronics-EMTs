The circuit shown in figure 1-29 is a class A transistor push-pull amplifier, but class AB or class B 
operations can be used. Class operations were discussed in an earlier topic. The phase splitter for this 
amplifier is the transformer T1, although one of the phase splitters shown earlier in this topic could be 
used. R1 provides the proper bias for Q1 and Q2. The tapped secondary of T1 develops the two input 
signals for the bases of Q1 and Q2. Half of the original input signal will be amplified by Q-1, the other 
half by Q-2. T2 combines (couples) the amplified output signal to the speaker and provides impedance 
matching.
