In bicycles, the steering axis angle is called the head angle and is measured from the horizontal; a 90° head angle would be vertical. For example, Lemond offers:
a 2007 Filmore, designed for the track, with a head angle that varies from 72.5° to 74° depending on frame size
a 2006 Tete de Course, designed for road racing, with a head angle that varies from 71.25° to 74°, depending on frame size.
Due to front fork suspension, modern mountain bikes - as opposed to road bikes - tend to have slacker head tube angles, generally around 70° although they can be as low as 62° (depending on frame geometry setting).
At least one manufacturer, Cane Creek, offers an after-market threadless headset that enables changing the head angle.
