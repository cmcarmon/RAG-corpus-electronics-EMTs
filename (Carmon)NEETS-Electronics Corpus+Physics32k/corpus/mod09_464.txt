The electrical length (sweep time), which is measured from T2 to T3, can be found by multiplying 
RC times the number of time constants. Refer to the Universal Time Constant Chart (figure 3-39) again to 
find that 57 percent is 0.83TC. By multiplying 0.83 times R1C1, you will find that the electrical length is 
approximately 21 milliseconds:
