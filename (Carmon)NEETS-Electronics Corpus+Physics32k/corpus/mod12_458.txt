Figure 3-13 is a simplified schematic diagram of a ratio detector at resonance. The voltage applied to
the cathode of CR1 is the vector sum of e1 and ep. Likewise, the voltage applied to the anode of CR2 is
the vector sum of e2  and ep. No phase shift occurs at resonance and both voltages are equal. Both diodes
conduct equally. This equal current flow causes the same voltage drop across both R1 and R2. C3 and C4
will charge to equal voltages with opposite polarities. Letâ€™s assume that the voltages across C3 and C4 are
equal in amplitude (5 volts) and of opposite polarity and the total charge across C5 is 10 volts. R1 and R2
will each have 5 volts dropped across them because they are of equal values. The output is taken between
points A and B. To find the output voltage, you algebraically add the voltages between points A and B
(loop ACB or ADB). Point A to point D is - 5 volts. Point D to point B is + 5 volts. Their algebraic sum is
0 volts and the output voltage is 0 at resonance. If the voltages on branch ACB were figured, the same
output would be found because the circuit branches are in parallel.
