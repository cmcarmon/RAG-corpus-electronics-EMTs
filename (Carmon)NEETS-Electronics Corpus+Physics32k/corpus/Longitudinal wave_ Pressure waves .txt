In an elastic medium with rigidity, a harmonic pressure wave oscillation has the form,

)

=

y

cos
⁡
(
k
x
−
ω
t
+
φ
)


{\displaystyle y(x,t)\,=y_{0}\cos(kx-\omega t+\varphi )}

where:
y0 is the amplitude of displacement,
k is the wavenumber,
x is the distance along the axis of propagation,
ω is the angular frequency,
t is the time, and
φ is the phase difference.
The restoring force, which acts to return the medium to its original position, is provided by the medium's bulk modulus.
