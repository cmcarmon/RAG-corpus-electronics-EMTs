sheets. The construction of a corner reflector is shown in figure 4-42. Corner-reflector antennas are 
mounted with the radiator and the reflector in the horizontal position when horizontal polarization is 
desired. In such cases the radiation pattern is very narrow in the vertical plane, with maximum signal 
being radiated in line with the bisector of the corner angle. The directivity in the horizontal plane is 
approximately the same as for any half-wave radiator having a single-rod type reflector behind it. If the 
antenna is mounted with the radiator and the corner reflector in the vertical position, as shown in view A, 
maximum radiation is produced in a very narrow horizontal beam. Radiation in a vertical plane will be the 
same as for a similar radiator with a single-rod type reflector behind it.
