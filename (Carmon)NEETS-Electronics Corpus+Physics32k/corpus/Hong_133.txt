The equivalent circuit of the peak detector for the case of reverse-biased diode is 
shown  in  Figure  10.6.  The  diode  in  reverse  bias  is  assumed  to  behave  as  a  very  large 
resistor with resistance RD. The open-loop gain of this feedback circuit is AÂ·D, where A is 
the open-loop gain of the op amp and D is the signal attenuation resulting from RD with C 
and R. Specifically,
