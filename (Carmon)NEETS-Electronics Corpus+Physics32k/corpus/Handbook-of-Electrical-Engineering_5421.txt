Though  the  symmetrical  component  method  has  been  used  to  simplify  many  of  the  problems  in  power
system analysis, the following paragraphs, which describe the formulas in the calculation of the line parameters,
are  much  more  general  and  are  not  limited  to  the  application  of  symmetrical  components.  The  sequence
impedances and admittances used in the symmetrical components method can be easily calculated by a matrix
transformation [Chen and Dillon, 1974]. A detailed discussion of symmetrical components can be found in
Clarke [1943].
