Dual pairs are shown in Table 8.1. Note that power does not appear in
Table 8.1, because power has no dual. The reason for this is the prin-
ciple of linearity; since power is not linear, duality does not apply. Also
notice  from  Table  8.1  that  the  principle  of  duality  extends  to  circuit
elements, conÔ¨Ågurations, and theorems.
