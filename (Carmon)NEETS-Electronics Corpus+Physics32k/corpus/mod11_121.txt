Because of the use of the decibel measurement system in the following paragraphs, you will be 
introduced to it at this point. Technicians who deal with communications and radar equipment most often 
speak of the gain of an amplifier or a system in terms of units called DECIBELS (dB). Throughout your 
Navy career you will use decibels as an indicator of equipment performance; therefore, you need to have 
a basic understanding of the decibel system of measurement. Because the actual calculation of decibel 
measurements is seldom required in practical applications, the explanation given in this module is 
somewhat simplified. Most modern test equipment is designed to measure and indicate decibels directly 
which eliminates the need for complicated mathematical calculations. Nevertheless, a basic explanation of 
the decibel measurement system is necessary for you to understand the significance of dB readings and 
equipment gain ratings which are expressed in decibels.
