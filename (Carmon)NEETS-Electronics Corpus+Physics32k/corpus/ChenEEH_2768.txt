In Figure 9.9(B), the apparent anomaly of observing disper-
sion-induced jitter along what should be a dispersionless wave
path at f Â¼ 45 is resolved by noting that numerical disper-
sion introduces a slightly anisotropic propagation characteris-
tic of the background free space in the grid versus azimuth
angle f. The resulting inhomogeneity of the free space back-
ground scatters part of the radially propagating numerical
wave into the f direction. Thus, no point behind the wave-
front can avoid the short-wavelength numerical jitter.
