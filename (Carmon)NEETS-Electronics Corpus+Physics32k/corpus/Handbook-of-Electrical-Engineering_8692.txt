CISC: Complex instruction set computer, a name to mean “not a RISC,” but generally one that offers a very rich
vocabulary  of  computer  operations  at  a  cost  of  making  the  processor  which  must  handle  this  variety  of
operations more complex, expensive, and often slower than a RISC designed for the same task. One of the
beneﬁts of a CISC is that the code tends to be very compact. When memory was an expensive commodity,
this was a substantial beneﬁt. Today, speed of execution rather than compactness of code is the dominant force.
Compiler: A computer program (application) for translating a HLL text ﬁle to an object ﬁle suitable for linking
to become an executable image (application) in machine language. Some compilers do both compilation
and linking, so their output is an application.
