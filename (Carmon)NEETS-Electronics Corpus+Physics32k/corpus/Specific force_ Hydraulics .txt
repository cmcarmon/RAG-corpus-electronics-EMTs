In open channel hydraulics, specific force (




F

s




{\displaystyle F_{s}}
) has a different meaning:





F

s


=



Q

2



g
A



+
z
A


{\displaystyle F_{s}={\frac {Q^{2}}{gA}}+zA}

where Q is the discharge, g is the acceleration due to gravity, A is the cross-sectional area of flow, and z is the depth of the centroid of flow area A.
