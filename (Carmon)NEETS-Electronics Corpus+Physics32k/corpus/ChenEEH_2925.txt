aspect fm. The image can be reconstructed by taking a 2-D
Fourier transform over the collected frequency responses. To
use the efﬁcient 2-D fast Fourier transform (FFT),
the
data sampled in polar grid format should be converted to data
sampled in rectangular grid format through an interpolation
process as shown in Figure 10.8(B). The image is then pro-
cessed by taking the 2-D FFT on the interpolated samples
as shown in Figure 10.8(C). If the data measured are the com-
plex range proﬁles for each aspect angle, we can convert the
complex range proﬁle into the complex frequency response
through a 1-D FFT and arrange the frequency response data in
polar format. The image can be reconstructed by the same
procedure shown in Figure 10.8. The cross-range resolution
DX of rotating object imaging is related to the total rotation
angle fT and wavelength l by:
