0 and Q to variations in component values. In
this conﬁguration the operational ampliﬁer’s gain-bandwidth product may become a limitation for high-Q and
high-frequency applications [Budak, 1974]. There are several other circuit conﬁgurations for low-pass ﬁlters.
The references given at the end of the section will guide the designer to alternatives and the advantages of each.
