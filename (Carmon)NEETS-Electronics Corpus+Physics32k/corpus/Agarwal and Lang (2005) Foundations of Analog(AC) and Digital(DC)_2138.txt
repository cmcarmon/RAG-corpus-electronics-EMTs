as before. The voltage constraint of Equation 15.19 is also called the virtual
ground constraint,2 and can be interpreted in physical terms by noting that the
output of a circuit with negative feedback must adjust itself to force (v
) to
be nearly zero, because that nearly-zero voltage is in turn multiplied by 100,000
to become the output voltage.
âˆ’ (cid:1) 0 constraint can be applied only if the Op Amp is not saturated
The v
and the feedback is negative; that is, the net feedback signal comes from the
output back to the negative input terminal.
