Other commonly used approaches for recognition of noisy speech signals were developed for systems which
are  based  on  pattern  recognition. When  clean  signals  are  available  for  recognition,  these  systems  match  the
input  signal  to  the  nearest  neighbor  acoustic  templet  which  represents  some  word  in  the  vocabulary.  The
templets mainly comprise spectral prototypes of the clean signals. The matching is performed using a distance
measure between the clean input signal and the templet. When only noisy signals are available for recognition,
