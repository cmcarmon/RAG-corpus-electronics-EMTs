Since two waves of voltage are moving on the line, you need to know how to distinguish between the
two. The voltages moving toward the receiving end are called INCIDENT VOLTAGES, and the whole
waveshape is called the INCIDENT WAVE. The wave moving back to the sending end after reflection is
called the REFLECTED WAVE. The resultant voltage curve (view B of figure 3-26) shows that the
voltage is maximum at the end of the line, a condition that occurs across an open circuit.
