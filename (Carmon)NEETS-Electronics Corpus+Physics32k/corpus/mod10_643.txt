Radiation from a light source and radiation from an antenna are both forms of electromagnetic 
waves. Therefore, the measurement of radiation of an antenna follows the same basic procedure as that 
just described for the Sun and the flashlight. Before proceeding further with the study of antenna patterns, 
you should be sure you understand the methods used to graph the measured radiation (magnitude of the 
radiation). Study the rectangular- and polar-coordinate systems of plotting presented in the following 
section.
