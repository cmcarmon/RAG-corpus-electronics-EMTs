The fluid dram (or fluid drachm in British spelling) is defined as ​1⁄8 of a fluid ounce, and is exactly equal to:
3.6966911953125 ml in the US customary system
3.5516328125 ml in the imperial system
A teaspoonful has been considered equal to one fluid dram for medical prescriptions. However, by 1876 the teaspoon had grown considerably larger than it was previously, measuring 80–85 minims. As there are 60 minims in a fluid dram, using this equivalent for the dosage of medicine was no longer suitable. Today's US teaspoon is equivalent to exactly ​1⁄6 US fluid ounces, ​1 1⁄3 US fluid drams, or 80 US minims.
While pharmaceuticals are measured nowadays exclusively in metric units, fluid drams are still used to measure the capacity of pill containers.
Dram is used informally to mean a small amount of spirituous liquor, especially Scotch whisky. The unit is referenced by the phrase dram shop, the US legal term for an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages.
