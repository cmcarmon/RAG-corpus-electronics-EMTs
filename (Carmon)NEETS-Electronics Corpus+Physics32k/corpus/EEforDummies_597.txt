▶✓ Switching: If you can switch electron flow on and off, you have control 
over the flow, and you can build involved circuits by incorporating lots 
of switches in the right places.
Consider, for instance, the telephone‐switching system: By dialing a  
10‐digit number, you can connect with any one of millions of people 
around the world. Or look at the Internet: Switching enables you to 
access a website hosted in, say, Sheboygan while you’re sitting on a train 
in, say, London. Other systems that rely on switching are computers, 
traffic lights, the electric power grid — well, you get the idea. Switching 
is pretty darn important.
