Most transistorized equipments use printed circuit boards on which components are neatly arranged.
This arrangement makes the transistors and other components easy to reach while you are troubleshooting
and servicing the equipment. While investigating with test probes, however, you must be careful to
prevent damage to the printed wiring.
