Among the factors affecting the choice of the basis and weight functions, therefore, one of the most important
is that of reducing the computational effort needed to obtain the coefﬁcients of the direct matrix. This is one
of the reasons, aside from their physical appeal, why sinusoidal bases are often used for wire problems. In this
case, where piecewise linear, ﬁlamentary current sources are most often used in connection with the thin-wire
approximation, ﬁeld expressions are available in easily evaluated, analytical expressions. This is the case as well
where Galerkin’s method is used.
