Implementation Modeling
Two principal activities must be accomplished in transitioning from the essential to the implementation model.
First, all of the methods and data encapsulated by each object must be mapped to the implementation environ-
ment. This process is illustrated in Fig. 90.10. Second, all of the details which were ignored in the essential model
(such as user interfaces, communication protocols, hardware limitations, etc.) must now be accounted for.
