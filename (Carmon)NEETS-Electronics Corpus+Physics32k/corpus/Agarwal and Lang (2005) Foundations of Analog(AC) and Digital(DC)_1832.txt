Two networks that could be used to model an acoustic system are shown in Figure 12.73.
It is known that the inductance L is small (specifically L << (R2C)/4) but it is not known
whether a circuit model with no inductances will be adequate. You are to help answer
this problem by determining the difference in the responses of the capacitor voltage vC
for the two circuits. Specifically, assume:
iS(t) = Iu−1(t)
−
vC(0
−
iL(0
