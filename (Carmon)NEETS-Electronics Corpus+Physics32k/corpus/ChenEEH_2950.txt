Last, this chapter brieï¬‚y discusses active integrated antennas
(AIAs). In this approach, the compatibility of planar antennas
with popular microwave frequency transmission lines and
active devices is exploited by directly integrating the active
circuitry with the antenna platform. This results in a compact
and highly functional system with many interesting character-
istics.
