The receiver sensitivity is the minimum amount of optical power required to achieve a specific
receiver performance. For digital transmission at a given data rate and coding, this performance is
described by a maximum bit-error rate (BER). In analog systems, for a given modulation and bandwidth,
it is described by a minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Dynamic range refers to the range of optical
power levels over which the receiver operates within the specified values. It usually is described by the
ratio of the maximum input power to the sensitivity. Before discussing receiver sensitivity, bandwidth,
dynamic range, and frequency response in more detail, we discuss the main types of optical detectors used
in fiber optics.
