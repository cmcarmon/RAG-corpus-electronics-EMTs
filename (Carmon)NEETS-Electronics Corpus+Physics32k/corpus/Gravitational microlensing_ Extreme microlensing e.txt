In a typical microlensing event, the light curve is well fit by assuming that the source is a point, the lens is a single point mass, and the lens is moving in a straight line: the point source-point lens approximation. In these events, the only physically significant parameter that can be measured is the Einstein timescale




t

E




{\displaystyle t_{E}}
. However, in some cases, events can be analyzed to yield the additional parameters of the Einstein angle and parallax:




θ

E




{\displaystyle \theta _{E}}
and




π

E




{\displaystyle \pi _{E}}
. These include very high magnification events, binary lenses, parallax, and xallarap events, and events where the lens is visible.
