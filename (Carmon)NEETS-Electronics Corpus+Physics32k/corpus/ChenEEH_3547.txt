and fH (v) are referred to as the magnitude
response and the phase response of the system, respectively. In
equations 1.42 and 1.43, the system magnitude response rep-
resents the gain or attenuation that the input signal content at
frequency v experiences when the system maps it to the
output. The system phase response represents the correspond-
ing phase shift at frequency v.
