Data obtained for a signal only at discrete intervals (sampling period) is called sampled data. One advantage
of working with sampled data is the ability to represent sequences as combinations of sampled time signals.
Table 8.2 provides some key z-transform pairs. So that the table can serve a multiple purpose, there are three
items per line: the Ô¨Årst is an indicated sampled continuous-time signal, the second is the Laplace transform of
the continuous-time signal, and the third is the z-transform of the uniformly sampled continous-time signal.
To illustrate the interrelation of these entries, consider Fig. 8.2. For simplicity, only single-sided signals have
been used in Table 8.2. Consequently, the convergence regions are understood in this context to be Re[s] < s
