EOT is expected to play an important role in the creation of components of 'photonic' circuits. (Photonic circuits are analogous to electronic circuits.)
One of the most ground-breaking results linked to EOT is the possibility to implement a Left-Handed Metamaterial (LHM) by simply stacking hole arrays.
EOT-based chemical sensing is another major area of research. Much like in a traditional surface plasmon resonance sensor, the EOT efficiency varies with the wavelength of the incident light, and the value of the in-plane wavevector component. This can be exploited as a means of transducing chemical binding events by measuring a change in the local dielectric constant (due to binding of the target species) as a shift in the spectral location of the EOT peak. EOT offers one key advantage over a Kretschmann-style SPR chemical sensor, that of being an inherently nanometer-micrometer scale device; it is therefore particularly amenable to miniaturization.
