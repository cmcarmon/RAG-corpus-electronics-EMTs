Cultural differences in the distribution of android fat have been observed in several studies. Compared to Europeans, South Asian individuals living in the UK have greater abdominal fat. Asian Indians living in the USA have high levels of body fat in contrast to their muscle mass and BMI  Newborn babies in India also show similar differences in their body fat distribution. There is a difference in waist-to-hip ratio (WHR’s) between Indian people and Africans living in South Africa such that Indians have greater WHR’s compared to African people.
A difference in body fat distribution was observed between men and women living in Denmark (this includes both android fat distribution and gynoid fat distribution), of those aged between 35 and 65 years, men showed greater body fat mass than women. Men showed a total body fat mass of 6.9 kg and women showed a total body fat mass of 4.5 kg. These observed difference could be due to a difference in muscularity. Australian Aborigines who live a hunter gatherer lifestyle, have been noted to have high levels of obesity (with an android fat distribution) when they switch to a Westernized lifestyle. This is because in comparison to their previous lifestyle where they would engage in strenuous physical activity daily and have meals that are low in fat and high in fiber, the Westernized lifestyle has less physical activity and the diet includes high levels of carbohydrates and fats.
