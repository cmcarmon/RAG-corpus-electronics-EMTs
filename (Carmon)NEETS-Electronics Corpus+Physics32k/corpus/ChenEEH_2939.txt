not rigorous since it depends on the incident wave vector.
Note that this type of diffraction tomography is applicable
only to the large, smooth convex conductor because of the
limitation on the PO approximation. Compared to the inver-
sion algorithm of Bojarski’s identity for which the far-ﬁeld
measured data are required, the measurement for the diffrac-
tion tomography can be made in the near zone. This may be
convenient in practical applications.
