Although telemetry is usually deﬁned as measurement at a distance, it has also gradually begun to embody
the concept of control from a distance. In telemetry—the transmission of the value of a quantity from a remote
point—it  may  serve  merely  to  communicate  the  reading  on  an  instrument  at  a  distance.  The  output  of  the
instrument can also be fed into a control mechanism, however, such as a relay or an alarm, so that the telemetered
signal can activate, stop, or otherwise regulate a process. Measurement may be taken at one location, indication
provided at a second location, and the remote control function initiated at one of those two locations or at a
third point.
