At terminal (or settling) velocity, the excess force Fg due to the difference between the weight and buoyancy of the sphere (both caused by gravity) is given by:

{\displaystyle F_{g}=\left(\rho _{p}-\rho _{f}\right)\,g\,{\frac {4}{3}}\pi \,R^{3},}

with ρp and ρf the mass densities of the sphere and fluid, respectively, and g the gravitational acceleration. Requiring the force balance Fd = Fg and solving for the velocity v gives the terminal velocity vs. Note that since the excess force increases as R3 and Stokes's drag increases as R, the terminal velocity increases as R2 and thus varies greatly with particle size as shown below. If the particle is falling in the viscous fluid under its own weight, then a terminal velocity, or settling velocity, is reached when this frictional force combined with the buoyant force exactly balances the gravitational force. This velocity v (m/s) is given by:

{\displaystyle v={\frac {2}{9}}{\frac {\left(\rho _{p}-\rho _{f}\right)}{\mu }}g\,R^{2}}

(vertically downwards if ρp > ρf, upwards if ρp < ρf ), where:
g is the gravitational acceleration (m/s2)
R is the radius of the spherical particle.
ρp is the mass density of the particles (kg/m3)
ρf is the mass density of the fluid (kg/m3)
μ is the dynamic viscosity (kg/m*s).
