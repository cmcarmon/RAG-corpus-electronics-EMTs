Hybrid systems combining CBR with rule-based reasoning
and model-based reasoning have also been developed. In com-
bining CBR and rule-based reasoning, rules may be used to
capture broad trends and general strategies in the problem
domain, whereas cases are used to support exceptions and
explain and justify rules. In combining CBR and model-based
reasoning, model-based reasoning is good at handling well-
understood components under normal situations, whereas
CBR covers the part of the domain that does not have a good
model or theory. In addition, by incorporating domain know-
ledge into CBR, past cases can be more efÔ¨Åciently organized,
searched, retrieved, and better adapted to the new cases.
