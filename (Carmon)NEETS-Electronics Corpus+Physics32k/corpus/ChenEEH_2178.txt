One quality measure of a permanent magnet is the ‘‘size’’ of
this demagnetization curve. A large Br and Hc in Figure 1.7
ensures that the intrinsic magnetization of the magnet is large
and remains ‘‘permanent’’ even for large H. Another selection
criterion used for permanent magnets is based on the energy
product BH. This quantity is appropriately named since
energy density is proportional to this product (see subsection
1.7.2), which is also plotted in Figure 1.7 by multiplying B and
H at each point along the demagnetization curve. The max-
imum energy product(BH )max is yet another measure of the
quality of a permanent magnet since H in the air gap produced
by the permanent magnet shown in Figure 1.8 is maximum
(with I ¼ 0) when the energy product is maximum. This
maximum energy product (BH )max for a selected number of
steels, alloys, and other materials is listed in Table 1.5 together
with the remanance Br and coercivity Hc.
