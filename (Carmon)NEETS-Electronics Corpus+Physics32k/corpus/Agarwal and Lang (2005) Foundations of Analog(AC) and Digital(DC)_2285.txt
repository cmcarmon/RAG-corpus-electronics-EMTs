Note that E is a vector. As illustrated in Figure A.4, the preceding equation
indicates that the voltage depends on the path x â†’ y. However, for our
lumped abstraction to apply, we require that we be able to assign a unique
voltage between the x and y terminals. Clearly, this voltage cannot be a function
of the specific path between the x and y points. It seems we have already hit a
snag in our attempt to create the abstraction of a lumped element to which the
lumped parameters V and I apply.
