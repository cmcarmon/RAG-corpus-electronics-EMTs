One can use the Julia-Mandelbrot 4-dimensional space for a global analysis of this dynamical system.
In this space there are 2 basic types of 2-D planes:
the dynamical (dynamic) plane,




f

c





{\displaystyle f_{c}\,}
-plane or c-plane
the parameter plane or z-plane
There is also another plane used to analyze such dynamical systems w-plane:
the conjugation plane
model plane
