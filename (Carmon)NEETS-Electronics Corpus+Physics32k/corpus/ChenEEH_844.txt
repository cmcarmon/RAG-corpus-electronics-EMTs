The clock signal is delivered to both the initial, Ri, and ﬁnal,
Rf , registers of any sequentially adjacent pair of registers
Ri ?Rf
in a circuit. The delays of the clock signal to these
two registers, Ri and Rf , may be different. This difference in
clock signal delay is accounted for by the concept of clock
skew deﬁned next:
