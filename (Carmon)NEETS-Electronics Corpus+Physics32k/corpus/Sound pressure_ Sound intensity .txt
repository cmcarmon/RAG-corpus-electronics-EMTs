In a sound wave, the complementary variable to sound pressure is the particle velocity. Together, they determine the sound intensity of the wave.Sound intensity, denoted I and measured in W·m−2 in SI units, is defined by





I

=
p

v

,


{\displaystyle \mathbf {I} =p\mathbf {v} ,}

where
p is the sound pressure;
v is the particle velocity.
