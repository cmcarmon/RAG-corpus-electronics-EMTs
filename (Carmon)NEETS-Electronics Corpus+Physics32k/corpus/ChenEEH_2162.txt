In example 1.8, it was mentioned that the net magnetic force
on a closed loop of current in a uniform B ﬁeld is zero.
However, this closed loop of current does experience a torque
and will rotate if it is free to do so. The torque T exerted on
any planar loop of current immersed in a uniform B ﬁeld is
given as (Cheng, 1989):
