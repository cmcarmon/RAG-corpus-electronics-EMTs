excursion  into  the  time  domain  for  modeling  this  interaction.  When  the  fundamental  (load  ﬂow)  is  also
included,  thus  simulating  the  interaction  between  fundamental  and  harmonic  frequencies,  it  is  termed  a
harmonic power ﬂow. The most advanced technique, which is still only a research tool, is the harmonic domain.
In this iterative technique one Jacobian is built-up that represents all harmonic frequencies. This allows coupling
between harmonics, which occurs, for example, in salient synchronous machines, to be represented.
