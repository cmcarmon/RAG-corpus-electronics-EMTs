Notice that the middle term of the equation uses the sum of mesh currents I1 and I2 as
the current through resistor R2. This is because mesh currents I1 and I2 are going the same
direction through R2, and thus complement each other. Distributing the coefÔ¨Åcient of 2 to the
I1 and I2 terms, and then combining I1 terms in the equation, we can simplify as such:
