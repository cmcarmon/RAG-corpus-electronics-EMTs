An announcement of radio propagation conditions (geophysical alert) for the North Atlantic area is 
broadcast by station WWV in voice at 18 minutes after each hour. For example, these short-term 
announcements might state, "The radio propagation quality forecast at ... (normal, unsettled, disturbed)." 
The propagation format is repeated phonetically and in numerical code to ensure clarity. The letter 
designations N, U, and W, signifying "normal," unsettled," and "disturbed," respectively, classify the 
radio propagation conditions at the time of the broadcast. The digits from 1 to 9 indicate the expected 
radio propagation conditions during the next 6 hours; refer to table 3-2 for code interpretations. The 
National Bureau of Standards forecasts are based on information obtained from a worldwide network of 
geophysical and solar observations.
