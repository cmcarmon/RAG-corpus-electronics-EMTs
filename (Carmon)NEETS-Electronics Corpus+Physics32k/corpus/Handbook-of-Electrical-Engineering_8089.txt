The incidence of recombination under equilibrium conditions is insufÔ¨Åcient for practical applications but
can be enhanced by increasing the minority carrier density. In an LED, this is accomplished by forward biasing
the diode, the injected minority carriers recombining with the majority carriers within a few diffusion lengths
 is reduced by forward bias
of the junction edge. Figure 83.1 illustrates the process. The potential barrier

, leading to net forward current and the minority carrier distributions shown on either side of the depletion
layer. As the carriers diffuse away from the junction edges, these distributions decay exponentially because of
recombination with the majority carriers. Each recombination event shown on either side of the junction gives
off a photon. This process is called
