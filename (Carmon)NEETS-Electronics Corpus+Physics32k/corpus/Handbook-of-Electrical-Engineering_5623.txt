The per-phase model of an ideal synchronous generator with non-
linearities and the stator resistance neglected is shown in Fig. 61.49,
where Eg is the generated (excitation) voltage and Xs is the steady-state
direct axis synchronous reactance. In the calculation of transient and
subtransient currents, Xs is replaced by transient reactance Xs¢ and subtransient reactance Xs¢¢, respectively.
