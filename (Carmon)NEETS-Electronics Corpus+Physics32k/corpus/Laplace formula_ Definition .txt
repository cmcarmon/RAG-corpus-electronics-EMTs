Consider two continuous media (top and bottom) whose surface of separation undergoes a small displacement. If




r

t




{\displaystyle r_{t}}
and




r

b




{\displaystyle r_{b}}
are the principal radii of curvature of the surface in some sample region, then the difference of pressures is




Δ
P

α

{\displaystyle \Delta P=\alpha \left({\frac {1}{r_{t}}}+{\frac {1}{r_{b}}}\right)}

where



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }
is the surface tension coefficient.
