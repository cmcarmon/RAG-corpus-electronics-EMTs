Other important factors that should be considered when using PC-based instruments over manual counterparts
are summarized in Table 108.5. Perhaps the most important choice is the selection of a minimum sampling
rate  for  the  data  acquisition  process.  It  must  be  chosen  to  meet  the  requirements  of  the  Nyquist  frequency.
 low pass ﬁlter that eliminates
However, in order to ensure that no higher frequencies are present, an 
energy above the Nyquist frequency should be employed. In order to provide sufﬁcient transition bandwidth
for  the  ﬁlter,  a  slightly  higher  sampling  rate  should  generally  be  employed.  A  factor  of  1.25  to  5  times  the
fs  is  a  good  compromise.  Automated  equipment  may  introduce  substantial  transients  into  the
minimum 
measurement  system.  Sufﬁcient  time  must  be  provided  for  the  resulting  transients  to  settle  to  an  acceptable
error bound; for example, 1%.
