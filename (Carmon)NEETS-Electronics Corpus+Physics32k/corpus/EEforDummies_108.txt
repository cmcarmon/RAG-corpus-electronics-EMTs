Controlling motion
A common use of electronics is to control the on/off activity and speed of 
motors. By connecting various objects — for instance, wheels, airplane flaps, 
or fan blades — to motors, you can use electronics to control their motion. 
Such electronics can be found in robotic systems, aircraft, spacecraft, eleva-
tors, and lots of other places.
