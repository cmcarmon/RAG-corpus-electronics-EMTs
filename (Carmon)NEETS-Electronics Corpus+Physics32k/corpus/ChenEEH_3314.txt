Newton-Raphson Algorithm
Unlike the Gauss-Seidel algorithm, which was originally
developed for solving simultaneous linear equations,
the
Newton-Raphson (NR) algorithm is speciﬁcally designed for
solving nonlinear equations. The algorithm proceeds itera-
tively by linearizing the nonlinear equations into linear equa-
tions at each step and by solving the linearized equations
exactly.
Suppose we want to solve the nonlinear equations F(x) ¼ 0,
where x is a n  1 vector and where F : R n ! R n is a smooth
nonlinear function. We have been given an initial condition x0.
Then, for computing the estimate xkþ1 from xk, we ﬁrst lin-
earize the functions F(x) at xk as follows:
