RIN is also caused by component reﬂections and double-Rayleigh backscatter in the ﬁber, by a process called
multipath interference. Twice-reﬂected signals arriving at the detector can interfere coherently with the unre-
ﬂected signal. Depending on the modulated optical spectrum of the laser, this interference results in noise that
can be signiﬁcant [Darcie et al., 1991].
