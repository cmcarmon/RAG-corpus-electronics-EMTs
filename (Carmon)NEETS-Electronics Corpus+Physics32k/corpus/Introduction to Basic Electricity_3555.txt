An LED is simply a Pâ€“N junction diode that emits 
light when a current flows through its  junction. 
The light is visible because the LED is packaged 
in  semitransparent material. The frequency of the 
light emitted depends on the material used in the 
 construction of the LED. Gallium arsenide (GaAs) 
 produces light in the infrared region, which is  invisible 
to  the  human  eye.  Gallium  arsenide   phosphide 
(GaAsP) emits a visible red light. By changing the 
phosphide content, different frequencies of light can 
be produced. LEDs are available in the following 
 colors: infrared, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, ultra-
violet, pink, purple, and white. The color of an LED is 
not determined by the color of the plastic lens but by 
the semiconductor material used to make it.
