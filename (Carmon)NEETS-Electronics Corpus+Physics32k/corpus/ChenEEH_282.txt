White noise sources are composed of thermal (also called
Johnson or Nyquist) noise and shot noise. Thermal noise is
generated by all resistive elements and is associated with the
random motion of carriers in an electronic element. It is a
function only of temperature. Shot noise is associated with the
discretization of charged particles and is always present in semi-
conductor pn junctions. It is a function only of dc current ï¬‚ow.
The thermal noise of a resistance, R, can be modeled as an
ideal resistor and an independent current or voltage source, as
shown in Figure 2.3. The Thevenin equivalent noise voltage is
given by:
