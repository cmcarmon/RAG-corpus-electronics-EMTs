LFSRs as Signature Analyzer
If the leftmost cell of an LFSR is connected to an external input, as shown in Fig. 85.7, the LFSR can be used
as a compactor [Bardell et al., 1987; Abramovici, 1992]. In general, the underlying operation of the LFSR is to
compute polynomial division over a ﬁnite ﬁeld, and the theoretical analysis of the effectiveness of  signature
analysis is based on this functionality. The polynomial describing the LFSR implementation is seen to be the
divisor  polynomial.  The  binary  input  stream  can  be  seen  to  represent  the  coefﬁcients  (high  order  ﬁrst)  of  a
dividend  polynomial.  For  example,  if  the  input  stream  is  1001011  (bits  are  input  left  to  right  in  time),  the
dividend polynomial is  x6 + x3 + x + 1. After seven clock cycles for all the input bits to have entered the LFSR,
the  binary  output  stream  exiting  from  the  right  denotes  the  quotient  polynomial,  while  the  last  state  of  the
cells in the LFSR denotes the remainder polynomial.
