There are seven major career areas in biomedical engineering: (1) application of engineering system analysis
and modeling (computer simulation) to biological problems; (2) measurement or monitoring of physiological
signals; (3) diagnostic interpretation via signal processing techniques of bioelectric data; (4) therapeutic and
rehabilitation procedures and devices; (5) prosthetic devices for replacement or augmentation of bodily func-
tions;  (6)  computer  analysis  of  patient-related  data;  and  (7)  medical  imaging,  i.e.,  the  graphic  display  of
anatomical detail or physiological function. Biomedical engineers, therefore, engage in the following pursuits:
