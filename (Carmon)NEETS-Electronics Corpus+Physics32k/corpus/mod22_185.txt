Some drums are mounted in a horizontal position, such as the one shown in figure 2-16, while others 
are mounted in a vertical position. Another major difference in the design is the number of read/write 
heads. Some drums use only one read/write head, which services all channels on the drum. In this case, 
the head moves back and forth (or up and down) over the surface of the drum as required. Other drums, 
using multiple read/write heads, have one principal advantage over drums with the single-head type. 
Since one read/write head is assigned to each channel, no read/write head movement is required. That is, 
the time required for head positioning is zero. The only significant time required when reading or writing 
is the rotational delay that occurs in reaching a desired record location.
