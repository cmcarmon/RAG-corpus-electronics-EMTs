increases in current demands from 13 A to 50 to 100 A
(Zhang et al., 1996). Meanwhile, operating frequencies will
increase to above 1 GHz. These demands, in turn, require
special power supplies, voltage regulator modules (VRMs), to
provide lower voltages with higher current capabilities for
microprocessors. Table 1.1 shows the speciÔ¨Åcations for present
and future VRMs.
