The Distance Unit



D
U



{\displaystyle DU\ }
is defined to be the mean radius of the reference orbit.
The Time Unit



T
U



{\displaystyle TU\ }
is defined by the gravitational parameter



μ



{\displaystyle \mu \ }
:




μ
=
G
∗
M




{\displaystyle \mu =G*M\,\!}





G



{\displaystyle G\ }
is the gravitational constant




M



{\displaystyle M\ }
is the mass of the central reference body
For canonical units, the gravitational parameter is defined as:




μ
=
1

U

{\displaystyle \mu =1*{\frac {DU^{3}}{TU^{2}}}}

The quantity of the time unit (TU) can be solved in another unit system (e.g. the metric system) if the mass and radius of the central body has been determined. Using the above equation and applying dimensional analysis, set the two equations expressing



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }
equal to each other:

{\displaystyle \mu =G*M=1*{\frac {DU^{3}}{TU^{2}}}}

The time unit (TU) can be converted to another unit system for a more useful qualitative solution using the following equation:

{\displaystyle TU={\sqrt {\frac {DU^{3}}{G*M}}}}

For Earth satellites, approximate unit conversions are as follows:
1 DU = 6378.1 km = 20,925,524.97 ft
1 DU/TU = 7.90538 km/s = 25,936.29 ft/sec
1 TU = 806.80415 s
