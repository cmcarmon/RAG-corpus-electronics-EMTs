Reverse-Conducting Thyristor (RCT) and Asymmetrical Silicon-Controlled 
RectiÔ¨Åer (ASCR)
Normally in inverter applications, a diode in antiparallel is connected to the thyristor for commutation/free-
wheeling purposes. In RCTs, the diode is integrated with a fast switching thyristor in a single silicon chip. Thus,
