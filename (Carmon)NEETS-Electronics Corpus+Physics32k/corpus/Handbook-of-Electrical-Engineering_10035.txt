Many control engineering text books contain material on nonlinear systems where the describing function is
discussed. The coverage, however, is usually restricted to the basic sinusoidal DF for determining limit cycles
in feedback systems. The basic DF method, which is one of quasilinearisation, can be extended to cover other
signals, such as random signals, and also to cover multiple input signals to nonlinearities and feedback system
analysis. The two books with the most comprehensive coverage of this are Gelb and Van der Velde [1968] and
Atherton [1975]. More specialized books on nonlinear feedback systems usually cover the phase plane method
and the DF, together with other topics such as absolute stability, exact linearization, etc.
