In most number systems you will find two types of complements. The first is the amount necessary
to complete a number up to the highest number in the number system. In the decimal system, this would
be the difference between a given number and all 9s. This is called the nines complement or the radix-1 or
Râ€™s-1 complement. As an example, the nines complement of 254 is 999 minus 254, or 745.
