The simple gap formed in air has a resistance during conduction of from 30 to 50 ohms. This is
usually too high for use with any but an open-wire transmission line. The time required for the air
surrounding the gap to completely deionize after the pulse voltage has been removed is about 10
microseconds. During this time the gap acts as an increasing resistance across the transmission line to
which it is connected. However, in a tr system using an air gap, the echo signals reaching the receiver
beyond the gap will be permitted to increase to half their proper magnitude 3 microseconds after the pulse
voltage has been removed. This interval is known as RECOVERY TIME.
