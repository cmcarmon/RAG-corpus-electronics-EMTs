A sloping leading edge also affects minimum range as well as range accuracy since it provides no
definite point from which to measure elapsed time on the indicator time base. Using a starting point at the
lower edge of the pulseâ€™s leading edge would increase minimum range. Using a starting point high up on
the slope would reduce the accuracy of range measurements at short ranges which are so vital for accurate
solution of the fire-control problem.
