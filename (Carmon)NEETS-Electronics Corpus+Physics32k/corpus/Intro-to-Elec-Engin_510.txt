Now coming back to the K map, a K map is a diagram made up of cells (squares), one for
each minterm of the function to be represented. An n-variable K map, representing an n-variable
function, therefore has 2n cells. Figures 6.1.12, 6.1.13, and 6.1.14 show the two-variable, three-
variable, and four-variable K maps, respectively, in two different forms. Note particularly the
code used in listing the row and column headings when more than one variable is needed.
