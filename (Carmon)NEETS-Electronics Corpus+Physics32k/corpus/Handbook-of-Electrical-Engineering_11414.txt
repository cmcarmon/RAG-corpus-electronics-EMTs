Since their introduction in the early 1960s, semiconductor radiation detectors have become the devices of choice
for numerous X-ray, gamma-ray, and charged particle measurements. They are essential in applications where
maximum energy resolution (i.e., the ability to record the energy of the incident photon or particle) is required.
In  this  characteristic,  their  performance  greatly  exceeds  that  of  gaseous  sensors  (proportional  counters,  for
example)  or  scintillator/photocell-based  spectrometers.  Their  superior  energy  resolution  stems,  in  the  main,
from the greater number of information carriers generated in semiconductors per unit of absorbed energy than
in, for example, scintillator/photocell combinations, which are widely used as low-resolution spectrometers. In
scintillator-based  spectrometers,  approximately  100 eV  of  absorbed  energy  is  required  to  generate  a  single
information carrier. In a typical semiconductor, only 3 to 5 eV are required to create one electron-hole pair —
the information carrier in semiconductor detectors. The statistical variation of the number of carriers produced
per ionizing event is thus substantially greater in the case of the scintillator and is reﬂected in reduced energy
resolution.  Similar  arguments  apply  to  gaseous  detectors,  where  the  relatively  small  number  of  information
carriers is due to the combination of the low density of the absorbing gas and the signiﬁcant energy required
to produce ion-pairs (≈30 eV per ion-pair, [1]), the information carrier in the gas detector.
