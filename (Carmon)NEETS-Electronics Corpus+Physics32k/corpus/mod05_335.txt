RESISTANCE-START.—Another type of split-phase induction motor is the resistance-start motor.
This motor also has a starting winding (shown in fig. 4-12) in addition to the main winding. It is switched
in and out of the circuit just as it was in the capacitor-start motor. The starting winding is positioned at
right angles to the main winding. The electrical phase shift between the currents in the two windings is
obtained by making the impedance of the windings unequal. The main winding has a high inductance and
a low resistance. The current, therefore, lags the voltage by a large angle. The starting winding is
designed to have a fairly low inductance and a high resistance. Here the current lags the voltage by a
smaller angle. For example, suppose the current in the main winding lags the voltage by 70º.  The current
in the auxiliary winding lags the voltage by 40º. The currents are, therefore, out of phase by 30º. The
magnetic fields are out of phase by the same amount. Although the ideal angular phase difference is 90º 
for maximum starting torque, the 30-degree phase difference still generates a rotating field. This supplies
enough torque to start the motor. When the motor comes up to speed, a speed-controlled switch
disconnects the starting winding from the line, and the motor continues to run as an induction motor. The
starting torque is not as great as it is in the capacitor-start.
