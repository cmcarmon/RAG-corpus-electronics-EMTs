Figure 29.28(d) shows the equivalent circuit of the current conveyor simulated inductor. The current conveyor
circuit can simulate a ﬂoating inductor, so neither node of the equivalent inductor is required to be grounded.
Figure 29.29 illustrates an application of simulated impedances. The circuit shown in Fig. 29.29(a) imple-
ments a voltage-controlled current source (VCCS). This particular VCCS has the advantage of perfect regulation.
In  other  words,  the  output  current,  io ,  is  completely  independent  of  the  load  resistance,  RL.  The  circuit  in
Fig. 29.29(a) requires a negative resistor, the resistor labeled –R. Since one node of this resistor is grounded,
