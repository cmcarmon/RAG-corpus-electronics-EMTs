is to produce a square wave output at a frequency 
of between 1 MHz and 6 MHz (depending upon the 
quartz crystal used). 
 
Assignment 18  Assembly language programming 
 
Use  a  simple  8-bit  microprocessor  system  to 
develop  a  simple  assembly  language  program  that 
will read the state of a  set of eight  input  switches 
connected to an input port and illuminate a bank of 
eight  light  emitting  diodes  connected  to  an  output 
port.  The  state  of  the  input  switches  is  to  be 
indicated by the light emitting diodes. 
 
Assignment 19  Variable pulse generator 
 
Design,  construct  and 
test  a  variable  pulse 
generator  (along  the  lines  of  that  shown  on  page 
224).  The  pulse  generator  is  to  provide  an  output 
from  1  Hz  to  10  kHz  with  a  pulse  width  variable 
from 50 µs to 500 ms. 
 
Assignment 20  AM radio tuner 
 
Design, construct and test a simple AM radio tuner 
based on a diode demodulator and a variable tuned 
circuit.  The  radio  tuner  is  to  cover  the  medium 
wave band from 550 kHz to 1.5 MHz and its output 
is  to  be  connected  to  an  external  audio  amplifier. 
Investigate  the  performance  of  the  tuner  and 
suggest ways in which it could be improved. 
 
Assignment 21  Analogue multimeter 
 
Design,  construct  and  test  a  simple  analogue 
multimeter  based  on  a  1  mA  moving  coil  meter. 
The multimeter is to have three voltage ranges (10 
V,  50  V  and  100  V),  two  current  ranges  (10  mA 
and 50 mA) and one ohms range. 
 
Assignment 22  PIC microcontroller 
 
Design,  construct  and 
test  a 
simple  PIC 
microcontroller-based intruder alarm. The alarm is 
to  be  capable  of  identifying  an  intrusion  into  any 
one  of  four  ‘zones’  using  an  LED  panel  and  is  to 
produce a master alarm signal using a piezoelectric 
transducer whenever any one of the alarm inputs is 
triggered. The alarm is to be ‘set’ and ‘reset’ using 
two further switch inputs.
