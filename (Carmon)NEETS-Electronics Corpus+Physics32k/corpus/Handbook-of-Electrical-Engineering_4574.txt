Arises because the numerical model used is normally an idealized mathematical representation of 
the actual physical reality
Arises because the numerical results obtained are only approximate solutions to that idealized 
representation and consists of two components:
(1) Solution errorâ€”The difference that can exist between the computed results and an exact
