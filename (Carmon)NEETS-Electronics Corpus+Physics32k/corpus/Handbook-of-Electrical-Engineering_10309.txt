Satellite power is increasing in the newer generation of satellites. Lower-power satellites have an EIRP in the
20–35 dBW range. There are a signiﬁcantly large number of medium-power satellites in the 35–45 dBW range.
Newer high-power satellites tend to have power in the 50–60 dBW range. Direct broadcast satellites are planned
for transponder power in the 60–120 W range. The power generally varies with polarization, frequency, and
beam. Table 102.2 is a proﬁle of typical satellite performance characteristics.
