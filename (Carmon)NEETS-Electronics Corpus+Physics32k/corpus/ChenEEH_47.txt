It may be noted that the application of the maximum power
transfer theorem is not restricted to simple circuits only.
The theorem can also be applied to complicated circuits as
long as the circuit is linear and there is one variable load. In
such cases, the complicated circuit across the variable load is
replaced by its equivalent Thevenin circuit. The maximum
power transfer theorem is then applied to Ô¨Ånd the load resist-
ance that leads to maximum power in the load.
