All  the  space-faring  nations  operate  worldwide  radio  networks  that  track  spacecraft,  compute  their  state
vectors,  and  predict  future  state  vectors  using  complex  models  of  gravity,  atmospheric  drag,  and  lunisolar
perturbations. NASA operates three tracking and data relay satellites (TDRS) that track spacecraft in low earth
orbit with accuracies of 10 to 50 m and 0.3 m/s. Specialized ground-based tracking stations monitor and reposition
the worldâ€™s many communication satellites [Berlin, 1988]. Other specialized stations track and communicate with
deep space probes. They achieve accuracies of 30 m and a few centimeters per second, even at enormous inter-
planetary distances, due to long periods of observation and precise orbit equations (see [Yuan, 1983]).
