Examine figure 3-1. This figure represents two unlike charges surrounded by their electrostatic field.
Because an electrostatic field is polarized positive to negative, arrows are shown radiating away from the
positive charge and toward the negative charge. Stated another way, the field from the positive charge is
pushing, while the field from the negative charge is pulling. The effect of the field is to push and pull the
unlike charges together.
