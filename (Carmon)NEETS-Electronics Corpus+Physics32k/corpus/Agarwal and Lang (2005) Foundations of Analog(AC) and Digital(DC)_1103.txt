Let us revisit the transfer curve of the amplifier shown in Figure 8.2. Con-
sider a very small region of the transfer curve in the vicinity of the operating
point (VI, VO). The slope of the curve segment is depicted in the figure. As
illustrated in Figure 8.4, if we focus our attention on the small curve segment
shown, it looks more or less linear. We will use this intuition to develop an
abstraction for amplifiers that appears linear for very small variations in the
input voltage.
