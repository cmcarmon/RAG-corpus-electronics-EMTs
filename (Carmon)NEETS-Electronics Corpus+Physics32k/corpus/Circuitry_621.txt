should  be  zero.  In  practice  the  impedance  is 
usually  between  70  O and  75  O. Furthermore,  at 
resonance  the  impedance  is  purely  resistive  and 
contains  no  reactive  component  (i.e.  inductance 
and  capacitance).  In  this  case  X is  negligible 
compared  with  R. It  is  also  worth  noting  that  the 
d.c. resistance (or ohmic resistance) of an aerial is 
usually  very  small 
its 
impedance and so it may be ignored. Ignoring the 
d.c.  resistance  of  the  aerial,  the  impedance  of  an 
its  radiation 
antenna  may  be 
resistance, Rr (see Fig. 13.21).
