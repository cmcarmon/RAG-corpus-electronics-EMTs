Building Orientation. All fenestration should be equipped with control device appropriate to any luminance
problems.  Special  attention  should  be  given  to  glare  control  latitudes  where  fenestration  frequently  receives
direct sunlight. Diffuse-glaring ﬁxed or adjustable louvers are some of the control means that may be applied.
For  an  industrial  building,  windows  in  the  sidewalls  admit  daylight  and  natural  ventilation  and  afford
occupants a view out. However, their uncontrolled luminance may be a problem. There are many control means
to make daylight useful to workers’ seeing tasks, resulting in energy savings as the ultimate goal.
