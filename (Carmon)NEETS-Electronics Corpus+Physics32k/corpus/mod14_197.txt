To CONVERT A WHOLE BASE 10 NUMBER to another system, divide the decimal number by
the base of the number system to which you are converting. Continue dividing the quotient of the
previous division until it can no longer be done. Extract the remainders Â¾ the remainder from the first
computation will yield the LSD; the last will provide the MSD.
