PLATE AREA affects the value of capacitance in the same manner that the size of a container affects
the amount of water that can be held by the container. A capacitor with the large plate area can store more
charges than a capacitor with a small plate area. Simply stated, "the larger the plate area, the larger the
capacitance".
