Unfocused and Focused SAR
The ranges between the scatterer and the antenna at different
ﬂying positions along the synthetic length are not a constant.
The range when the antenna is at both ends is greater than the
range when the antenna is at the normal to the ﬂight path.
When the range difference for the antenna at different posi-
tions exceeds a range resolution cell, it is called range walk.
A range walk will cause the reconstructed image to be un-
focused or obscure. To avoid the range walk, the maximum
synthetic length should be limited to a length that allows the
scatterers to always be in the far-ﬁeld of the synthetic antenna.
The synthetic length should be:
