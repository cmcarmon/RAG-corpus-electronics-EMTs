After the establishment of Maxwell’s theory in 1873, the
early electromagnetics analyses were associated with such
simple shapes as spheres, cylinders, and planes. As the scien-
tiﬁc and engineering demand for sophistication rose, solutions
to more complex geometries were needed. As a result, approxi-
mate techniques were developed to solve Maxwell’s equations.
One can view circuit theory as a reduced form of Maxwell’s
