Loop ﬁlters used in PLLs may be either active or passive depending on the speciﬁc application. Active ﬁlters
are  normally  used  in  more  critical  applications  when  superior  control  of  loop  parameters  and  reference
frequency suppression is required. The loop ﬁlter is typically followed by a low-pass ﬁlter to remove any residual
reference  frequency  component  from  the  phase  detector.  This  low-pass  ﬁlter  will  affect  the  calculated  loop
response and will typically appear to reduce the loop damping factor as its corner frequency is brought closer
to the loop natural frequency. To avoid this degradation the corner frequency of this ﬁlter should be approxi-
mately one order of magnitude greater than the loop natural frequency. In some cases a notch ﬁlter may be
used to reduce the reference frequency when it is close to the reference frequency.
