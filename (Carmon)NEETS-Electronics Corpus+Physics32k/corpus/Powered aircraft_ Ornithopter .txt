The ornithopter obtains thrust by flapping its wings. When the wing flaps, as opposed to gliding, it continues to develop lift as before, but the lift is rotated forward to provide a thrust component.
Working devices have been created for flight research and as prototypes, but the vertical oscillation of the fuselage, which tends to accompany the wing flapping, limits their usefulness. The only practical application is a flying model hawk used to freeze prey animals into stillness so that they can be captured.
Toys in the form of a flying model bird are also popular.
