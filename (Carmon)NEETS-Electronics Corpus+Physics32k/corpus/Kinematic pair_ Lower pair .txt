A lower pair is an ideal joint that constrains contact between a surface in the moving body to a corresponding surface in the fixed body. A lower pair is one in which there occurs a surface or area contact between two members, e.g. nut and screw, universal joint used to connect two propeller shafts. Cases of lower joints:
A revolute pair, or hinged joint, requires a line in the moving body to remain co-linear with a line in the fixed body, and a plane perpendicular to this line in the moving body maintain contact with a similar perpendicular plane in the fixed body. This imposes five constraints on the relative movement of the links, which therefore has one degree of freedom.
A prismatic joint, or slider, requires that a line in the moving body remain co-linear with a line in the fixed body, and a plane parallel to this line in the moving body maintain contact with a similar parallel plane in the fixed body. This imposes five constraints on the relative movement of the links, which therefore has one degree of freedom.
A screw pair requires cut threads in two links, so that there is a turning as well as sliding motion between them. This joint has one degree of freedom.
A cylindrical joint requires that a line in the moving body remain co-linear with a line in the fixed body. It is a combination of a revolute joint and a sliding joint. This joint has two degrees of freedom.
A spherical joint or ball and socket joint requires that a point in the moving body remain stationary in the fixed body. This joint has three degrees of freedom, corresponding to rotations around orthogonal axes.
A planar joint requires that a plane in the moving body maintain contact with a plane in fixed body. This joint has three degrees of freedom. The moving plane can slide in two dimensions along the fixed plane, and it can rotate on an axis normal to the fixed plane.
