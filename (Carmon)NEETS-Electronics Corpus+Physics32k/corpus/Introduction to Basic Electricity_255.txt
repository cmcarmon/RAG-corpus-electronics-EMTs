Although	the	automation	process	of	EDA	tools	may	eliminate	errors	in	a	circuit’s
system,	a	product	remains	a	subject	of	various	testing	methods.	This	is	due	to	the
industry	of	circuitry’s	insistence	on	guaranteeing	the	flawless	networks	of	circuit
systems.	In	the	aim	of	making	sure	that	a	circuit’s	functions	are	in	tune	with
specific	requirements,	it	is	interpreted,	analyzed,	and	verified.
In	the	event	when	a	circuit	(that	was	created	with	EDA	tools)	hadn’t	undergone
tests,	there	is	a	likelihood	that	it	won’t	function	for	a	specific	purpose.	Especially	if
the	project	will	be	employed	for	commercial	agenda,	the	industry	experts	are	not
granting	permission	to	distribute	“unevaluated”	circuit	systems.
