t i o n a l a m p l i f i e r c i r c u i t As will be clear in Chapter 15, the dif-
ferential amplifier shown in Figure 7.62 does not quite fit our notion of an operational
amplifier because vOUT is not zero for vIN1 = vIN2. This can be remedied with the addi-
tion of a common-source stage built with a p-channel MOSFET, as shown in Figure 7.63.
The common-source stage shifts the level of the output so that vOUT can be zero for
vIN1 = vIN2. It also provides additional voltage gain. Thus the circuit in Figure 7.63
serves as a simple operational amplifier.
