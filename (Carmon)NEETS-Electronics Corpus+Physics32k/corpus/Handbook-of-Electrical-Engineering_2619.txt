Ordinarily interface-trap charge is negligible (<1010/cm2 in silicon MOSFETs), and the other nonideal effects
upon threshold voltage are accounted for by introducing the ﬂatband voltage VFB, which corrects the gate bias
for these contributions. Then, using Eq. (24.39) with Fox = (VTH – VFB – fTH)/d we ﬁnd
