the collector and emitter, whereas small changes in the collector-emitter voltage have little
eﬀect on the base. The result is that the base is always part of the input to a four-terminal
network. There are three common conﬁgurations: common emitter (CE), common collector
(CC) and common base (CB), as shown in ﬁgure 5.5.
