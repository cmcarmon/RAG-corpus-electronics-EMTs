■● Sexual Issues: These can take many forms such as 
coworkers making jokes or remarks of a  suggestive 
or sexual nature, photos or computer screensavers 
of a suggestive or sexual nature, requests for sexual 
favors, or unwanted sexual advances. A person 
may find these behaviors  offensive and may feel 
uncomfortable in the  presence of the person who 
makes the comments.
