Compared with the traditional bulk metal or semiconductor materials, graphene has many unique and excellent properties, such as atomic layer thickness, linear band structure near Dirac cone, ultrahigh Fermi velocity, etc., making traditional Richardson's law derived for bulk materials invalid for graphene. Researchers from Singapore University of Technology and Design have proposed that there exists a new scaling of thermionic emission from a single-layer and few-layer graphene graphene which has been verified with an experiment.  They also proposed that graphene-based vacuum thermionic energy converter has an efficiency of about 45%, with cathode temperature ranging from 700 K to 900 K, which is greatly reduced compared to the traditional thermionic converter of above 1200 K and has a promising application in recycling the waste heat from industrial processes.
