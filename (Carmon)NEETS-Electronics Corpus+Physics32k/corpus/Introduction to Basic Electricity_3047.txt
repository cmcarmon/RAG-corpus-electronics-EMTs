In summary, a Pâ€“N junction diode is a one-direc-
tional device. When it is forward biased, a current 
flows. When it is reverse biased, only a small leakage 
current flows. It is this characteristic that allows the 
 diode to be used as a rectifier. A rectifier converts an 
AC voltage to a DC voltage.
