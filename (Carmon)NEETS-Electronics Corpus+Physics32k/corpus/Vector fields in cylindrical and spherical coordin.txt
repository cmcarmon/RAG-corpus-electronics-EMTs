NOTE: This page uses common physics notation for spherical coordinates, in which



θ


{\displaystyle \theta }
is the angle between the z axis and the radius vector connecting the origin to the point in question, while



ϕ


{\displaystyle \phi }
is the angle between the projection of the radius vector onto the x-y plane and the x axis. Several other definitions are in use, and so care must be taken in comparing different sources.
