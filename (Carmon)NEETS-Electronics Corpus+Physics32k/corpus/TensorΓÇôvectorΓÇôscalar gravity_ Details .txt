MOND is a phenomenological modification of the Newtonian acceleration law. In Newtonian gravity theory, the gravitational acceleration in the spherically symmetric, static field of a point mass



M


{\displaystyle M}
at distance



r


{\displaystyle r}
from the source can be written as




a

,


{\displaystyle a=-{\frac {GM}{r^{2}}},}

where



G


{\displaystyle G}
is Newton's constant of gravitation. The corresponding force acting on a test mass



m


{\displaystyle m}
is




F

.


{\displaystyle F=ma.}

To account for the anomalous rotation curves of spiral galaxies, Milgrom proposed a modification of this force law in the form

{\displaystyle F=\mu \left({\frac {a}{a_{0}}}\right)ma,}

In this form, MOND is not a complete theory: for instance, it violates the law of momentum conservation.
However, such conservation laws are automatically satisfied for physical theories that are derived using an action principle. This led Bekenstein to a first, nonrelativistic generalization of MOND. This theory, called AQUAL (for A QUAdratic Lagrangian) is based on the Lagrangian

Φ


{\displaystyle \Phi }
is the Newtonian gravitational potential,



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
is the mass density, and



f

{\displaystyle f(y)}
is a dimensionless function.
In the case of a spherically symmetric, static gravitational field, this Lagrangian reproduces the MOND acceleration law after the substitutions

Bekenstein further found that AQUAL can be obtained as the nonrelativistic limit of a relativistic field theory. This theory is written in terms of a Lagrangian that contains, in addition to the Einstein–Hilbert action for the metric field

{\displaystyle g_{\mu \nu }}

and two scalar fields



σ

and

, of which only



ϕ

is dynamical. The TeVeS action, therefore, can be written as

TeVeS solves problems associated with earlier attempts to generalize MOND, such as superluminal propagation. In his paper, Bekenstein also investigated the consequences of TeVeS in relation to gravitational lensing and cosmology.
