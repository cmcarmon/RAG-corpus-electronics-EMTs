The magnitude portion of the frequency response plot for the preceding system
function is shown in Figure 13.43. It is easy to see that the plot resembles that
for a high-pass filter. Signals with frequencies significantly greater than the break
frequency 1/ReqC will pass through, while signals with frequencies significantly
lower than 1/ReqC will be attenuated.
