If the charged particle is moving, then it will experience a Lorentz force given by







F

q
(



v

B

)


{\displaystyle {\vec {F}}=q({\vec {v}}\times {\vec {B}})}
,
where






v
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {v}}}
is the velocity vector and






B
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {B}}}
is the magnetic field vector.
Notice that the direction of the force is given by the cross product of the velocity and magnetic field. Thus, the Lorentz force will always act perpendicular to the direction of motion, causing the particle to gyrate, or move in a circle. The radius of this circle,




r

g




{\displaystyle r_{g}}
, can be determined by equating the magnitude of the Lorentz force to the centripetal force as

{\displaystyle {\frac {mv_{\perp }^{2}}{r_{g}}}=|q|v_{\perp }B}

Rearranging, the gyroradius can be expressed as

{\displaystyle r_{g}={\frac {mv_{\perp }}{|q|B}}}
.
Thus, the gyroradius is directly proportional to the particle mass and perpendicular velocity, while it is inversely proportional to the particle electric charge and the magnetic field strength. The time it takes the particle to complete one revolution, called the period, can be calculated to be
