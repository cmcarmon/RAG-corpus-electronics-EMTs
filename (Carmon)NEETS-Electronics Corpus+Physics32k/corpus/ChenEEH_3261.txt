The interconnected power system is often referred to as the
largest and most complex machine ever built by humankind.
This may be hyperbole, but it does emphasize an inherent truth:
there is a complex interdependency between different parts
of the system. That is, events in geographically distant parts of
the system may interact strongly and in unexpected ways. Power
system analysis is concerned with understanding the operation
of the system as a whole. Generally, the system is analyzed either
under steady-state operating conditions or under dynamic
conditions during disturbances.
