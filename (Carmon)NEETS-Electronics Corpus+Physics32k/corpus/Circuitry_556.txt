The  555  timer  is  without  doubt  one  of  the  most 
versatile integrated circuit chips ever produced. Not 
only  is  it  a  neat  mixture  of  analogue  and  digital 
circuitry  but  its  applications  are  virtually  limitless 
in the world of timing and digital pulse generation. 
The device also makes an excellent case study for 
newcomers  to  electronics  because  it  combines  a 
number of important concepts and techniques.
