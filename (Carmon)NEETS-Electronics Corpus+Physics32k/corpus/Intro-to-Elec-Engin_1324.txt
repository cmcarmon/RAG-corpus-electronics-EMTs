The importance of the sampling theorem lies in the fact that it provides a method of recon-
struction of the original signal from the sampled values and also gives a precise upper bound
on the sampling interval (or equivalently, a lower bound on the sampling frequency) needed
for distortionless reconstruction. The minimum sampling frequency fs = 2W is known as
Nyquist rate.
