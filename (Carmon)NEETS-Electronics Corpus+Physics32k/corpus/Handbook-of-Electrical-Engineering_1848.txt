where the weighting (shading) factor is allowed to be complex. Uniformly distributed apertures and uniformly
spaced volumetric arrays which admit product separable sensor weightings can be treated by using the well-
developed  theory  of  linear  discrete  arrays  and  their  associated  polynomial.  When  the  product  separability
property does not hold, scopes exist for applying results from multidimensional systems theory [Bose, 1982]
concerning multivariate polynomials to the synthesis problem of volumetric arrays.
