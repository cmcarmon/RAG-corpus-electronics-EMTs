The fact that series voltages add up should be no mystery, but we notice that the polarity of
these voltages makes a lot of difference in how the ﬁgures add. While reading voltage across
R1, R1−−R2, and R1−−R2−−R3 (I’m using a ”double-dash” symbol ”−−” to represent the series
connection between resistors R1, R2, and R3), we see how the voltages measure successively
larger (albeit negative) magnitudes, because the polarities of the individual voltage drops are
in the same orientation (positive left, negative right). The sum of the voltage drops across R1,
R2, and R3 equals 45 volts, which is the same as the battery’s output, except that the battery’s
polarity is opposite that of the resistor voltage drops (negative left, positive right), so we end
up with 0 volts measured across the whole string of components.
