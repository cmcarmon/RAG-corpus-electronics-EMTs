The articulators are used to change the properties of the
acoustic ﬁlter over time. The ﬁlter is loaded at its main output
by a radiation impedance (‘‘ﬂow-to-pressure converter’’) due
to the lips. The vocal tract (and/or nasal tract, when appropri-
ate) is excited in two principal ways in most natural
lan-
guages.4 The main function of the larynx in speech is to
provide a periodic ﬂow waveform (called the voice or pho-
nation) as input to the acoustic system in the production of
voiced speech sounds. The voice waveform is a periodic low-
pass pulse train whose fundamental frequency, usually denoted
F0, reﬂects the frequency of glottal vibration.5 Voiced speech
