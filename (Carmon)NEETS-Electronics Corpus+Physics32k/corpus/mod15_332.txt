For example, when a force is applied upward on the inner gimbal, as shown in figure 3-8, the force 
may be visualized as applied in an arc about axis Y-Y. This applied force is opposed by the resistance of 
gyroscopic inertia, preventing the gyro from rotating about axis Y-Y. With the rotor spinning clockwise, 
the precession will take place 90ยบ clockwise from the point of applied force. The gyro precesses about 
axis Z-Z in the direction of the arrow "P".
