The Woodward effect is a physical hypothesis about the possibility for a body to see its mass change when the energy density varies in time. Proposed in 1990 by James Woodward, the effect is based on a formulation of Mach's principle proposed in 1953 by Dennis Sciama.
If confirmed experimentally (see timeline of results in the main article), the Woodward effect would open pathways in astronautics research, as it could be used to propel a spacecraft by propellantless propulsion meaning that it would not have to expel matter to accelerate. As previously formulated by Sciama, Woodward suggests that the Wheelerâ€“Feynman absorber theory would be the correct way to understand the action of instantaneous inertial forces in Machian terms.
