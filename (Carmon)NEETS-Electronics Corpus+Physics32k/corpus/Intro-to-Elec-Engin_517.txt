as a don’t-care output because of a physical constraint. As another example, Figure 6.1.16 shows
the logic circuitry in a black box with four input lines representing BCD data. For such a circuit,
six of the input combinations (1010, 1011, 1100, 1101, 1110, and 1111) are not valid BCDs, and
therefore the output of this circuitry cannot be speciﬁed because of a logic constraint. Such outputs
are hence labeled as don’t-care outputs. A don’t-care output or condition is generally represented
by the letter d in the truth table and the K map.
