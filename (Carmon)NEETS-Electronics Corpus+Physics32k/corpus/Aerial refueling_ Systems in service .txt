US Air Force fixed-wing aircraft use the flying boom system. Typically countries operating F-16 or F-15 variants have had a need for boom equipped tankers. Therefore, in addition to the USAF, the boom system is used by the Netherlands (KDC-10), Israel (modified Boeing 707), Turkey (surplus US KC-135Rs), and Iran (Boeing 747).
Advantages
Higher fuel flow rates (up to 1,000 US gallons (3,800 l) / 6,500 pounds (2,900 kg) per minute for the KC-135 tanker) can be achieved with the large diameter of the pipe in the flying boom, requiring less time to complete refueling operations than probe-and-drogue systems.
Less susceptible to receiving aircraft pilot error and fatigue.
Less susceptible to adverse weather conditions.
Boom equipped tankers are readily convertible to multisystem refuel methods.
Disadvantages
Requires a boom operator.
Added complexity of modification with attaching a boom to an aircraft.
Boom only allows for one receiver at a time.
Fighter aircraft cannot accept fuel at the boomâ€™s maximum flow rate, requiring a reduction in refueling pressure when servicing these aircraft, reducing (but not eliminating) the flying boom's advantage over the drogue system when refueling fighter aircraft.
