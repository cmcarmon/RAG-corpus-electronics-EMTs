the surfaces of the two plates. A specially designed diode (a semiconductor 
device, discussed in Chapter 9) can function as an electronically controlled 
variable capacitor; such devices are known as varactors or varicaps — and 
you can change their capacitance by changing the DC voltage you apply 
to them.
