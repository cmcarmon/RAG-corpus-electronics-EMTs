An ELECTROLYTIC CAPACITOR is used where a large amount of capacitance is required. As the
name implies, an electrolytic capacitor contains an electrolyte. This electrolyte can be in the form of a liquid
(wet electrolytic capacitor). The wet electrolytic capacitor is no longer in popular use due to the care needed
to prevent spilling of the electrolyte.
