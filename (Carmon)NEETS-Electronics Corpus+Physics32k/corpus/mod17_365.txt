We can best explain the rfcs signal by comparing it to the on-off cw signal. Cw signals are 
essentially a constant frequency with no variations along the frequency axis. Figure 3-20, view A, is an 
example. The complete intelligence is carried as variations in the signal amplitude. Figure 3-20, view B, 
shows the same signal as a shift in frequency between the mark and space.
