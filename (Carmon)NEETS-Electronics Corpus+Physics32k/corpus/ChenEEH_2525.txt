In the design of coupling and ﬁltering elements, impedance
transformation may also be required because of the potential
difference in impedance between the source at the input and
load at the output. Such transformers not only match the input
to the output, but, they function at the same time as building
blocks for the couplers and the ﬁlters. Quarter-wavelength
coupled lines with various terminal conditions are among the
most popular structures, as shown in Figure 7.13 Coupled-line
