A meter connected across the terminals of a good 1.5-volt battery reads about 1.5 volts. When the
same battery is inserted into a complete circuit, the meter reading decreases to something less than 1.5
volts. This difference in terminal voltage is caused by the INTERNAL RESISTANCE of the battery (the
opposition to current offered by the electrolyte in the battery). All sources of electromotive force have
some form of internal resistance which causes a drop in terminal voltage as current flows through the
source.
