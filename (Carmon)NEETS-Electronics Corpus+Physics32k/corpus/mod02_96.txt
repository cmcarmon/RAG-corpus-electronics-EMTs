 When the battery switch (S1) in the LR circuit of figure 2-10(A) is closed, the rate of the current 
increase is maximum in the inductive circuit. At this instant all the battery voltage is used in overcoming 
the emf of self-induction which is a maximum because the rate of change of current is maximum. Thus 
the battery voltage is equal to the drop across the inductor and the voltage across the resistor is zero. As 
time goes on more of the battery voltage appears across the resistor and less across the inductor. The rate 
of change of current is less and the induced emf is less. As the steady-state condition of the current is 
approached, the drop across the inductor approaches zero and all of the battery voltage is "dropped" 
across the resistance of the circuit.
