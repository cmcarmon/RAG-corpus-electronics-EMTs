This is an indirect blower system which collects pressurized airflow from a standard blower device that can be of any type mentioned in this article, and directs the collected airflow through a hollow tube or toroid, blowing a thin high-velocity laminar airflow from holes or a continuous slot across the surface of the tube or toroid. These fans have a 3-dimensional mixed-flow impeller in a lower compartment. Air is drawn in and compressed, before being expelled through an annulus, and accelerated over an airfoil lamp. Inducing and entraining ambient air through vicious shearing, the loop-shaped upper section multiplies the total airflow many times. The high velocity laminar airflow tends to drag ambient air along with it, due to vicious shear. Only around 7% of the total airflow actually passes through the fan itself.
