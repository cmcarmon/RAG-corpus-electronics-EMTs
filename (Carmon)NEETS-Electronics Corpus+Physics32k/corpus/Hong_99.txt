The  op  amp’s  power  supply  terminals  are  typically  omitted  from  conceptual 
circuit  sketches;  although,  the  power  supply  is  often  a  source  of  circuit  problems  and 
requires special attention from the designer. Typically, op amps are powered by bipolar 
supplies  such  as  ±12  V  or  ±5  V.  The  op  amp’s  maximum  output  cannot  exceed  the 
supply voltage range, and is usually at least 1V less than either supply limit. When the op 
amp’s output has reached its positive or negative maximum, the output has “railed”.  This 
condition should be avoided in most instances.
