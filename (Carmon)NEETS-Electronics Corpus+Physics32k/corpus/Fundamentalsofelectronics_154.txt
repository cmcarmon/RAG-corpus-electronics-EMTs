Thus, we have the input-output relationship for our entire system having the form of voltage divider,
but it does not equal the input-output relation of the circuit without the voltage measurement device. We
can not measure voltages reliably unless the measurement device has little eﬀect on what we are trying to
measure. We should look more carefully to determine if any values for the load resistance would lessen its
impact on the circuit. Comparing the input-output relations before and after, what we need is Req ≈ R2.
or R2 (cid:28) RL. This is the condition
As Req =
we seek:
