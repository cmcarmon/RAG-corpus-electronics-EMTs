An underwriters	 laboratories	 (ul) label 
 (Figure 7-7) on a device implies that the product bear-
ing the label is safe for use as intended. Tests completed 
by Underwriters Laboratories determine whether a 
product meets the minimum safety standards. When 
purchasing a product, check to determine whether it 
has the UL label on it. The UL label has nothing to do 
with the quality of a product, only its safety.
