where b is the propagation constant of the signal
in the
particular mudium and is linked to the operating frequency
(v Â¼ 2pf ) and material property (e and m). The propagation
constants along each direction (bx=y=z) are linked to the guide
dimension and operating frequency using the following equa-
tions:
