The STC104 switch, also known as the C104 switch in its early phases, is an asynchronous packet-routing chip that was designed for building high-performance point-to-point computer communication networks. It was developed by INMOS in the 1990s and was the first example of a general-purpose production packet routing chip. It was also the first routing chip to implement wormhole routing, to decouple packet size from the flow-control protocol, and to implement interval and two-phase randomized routing.
The STC104 has 32 bidirectional communication links, called DS-Links, that each operate at 100 Mbit/s. These links are connected by a non-blocking crossbar that allows simultaneous transmission of packets between all input and output links.
