For light emission to occur, the conduction band must be populated with many electrons. This is achieved
by forward biasing a pn junction to inject electrons and holes into the junction region as shown in Fig. 31.7.
Figure 31.8(a) shows the cross section of a surface emitting LED with an integral lens fabricated into the
surface. The light from the LED is incoherent and emitted in all directions. The lens and the bottom reï¬‚ecting
surface increase the amount of light transmitted out of the front of the device. The output from the LED is
approximately linear with current but does decrease with increasing junction temperature.
