Audio frequency amplifiers 
 
Audio frequency amplifiers operate in the band of 
frequencies  that  is  normally  associated  with  audio 
signals (e.g. 20 Hz to 20 kHz). 
 
Wideband amplifiers 
 
Wideband  amplifiers  are  capable  of  amplifying  a 
very  wide  range  of  frequencies,  typically  from  a 
few tens of hertz to several megahertz. 
 
Radio frequency amplifiers 
 
Radio  frequency  amplifiers  operate  in  the  band  of 
frequencies  that  is  normally  associated  with  radio 
signals  (e.g.  from  100  kHz  to  over  1  GHz).  Note 
that it is desirable for amplifiers of this type to be 
frequency  selective  and 
their  frequency 
response  may  be  restricted  to  a  relatively  narrow 
band of frequencies (see Fig. 7.9 on page 135).
