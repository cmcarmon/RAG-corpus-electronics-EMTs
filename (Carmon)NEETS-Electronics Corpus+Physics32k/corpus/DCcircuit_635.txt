An example of a ”variant” wire connection might be the very last wire added (step 11), which
I placed between the left terminal of R2 and the left terminal of R3. This last wire completed
the parallel connection between R2 and R3 in the circuit. However, I could have placed this wire
instead between the left terminal of R2 and the right terminal of R1, since the right terminal
of R1 is already connected to the left terminal of R3 (having been placed there in step 9) and
so is electrically common with that one point. Doing this, though, would have resulted in three
wires secured to the right terminal of R1 instead of two, which is a faux pax in terminal strip
etiquette. Would the circuit have worked this way? Certainly! It’s just that more than two
wires secured at a single terminal makes for a ”messy” connection: one that is aesthetically
unpleasing and may place undue stress on the screw terminal.
