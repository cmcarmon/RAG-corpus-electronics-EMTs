The armature of a four-pole dc machine has a simplex lap wound commutator winding (which has
the number of parallel paths equal to the number of poles) with 120 two-turn coils. If the ï¬‚ux per
pole is 0.02 Wb, calculate the dc voltage appearing across the brushes located on the quadrature
axis when the machine is running at 1800 r/min.
