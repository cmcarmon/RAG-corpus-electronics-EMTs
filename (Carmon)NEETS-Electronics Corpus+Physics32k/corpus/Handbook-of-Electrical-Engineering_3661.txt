Many  magnetic  materials  change  dimensions  on  becoming  magnetized:  the  phenomenon  is  known  as
magnetostriction  and  can  be  positive,  i.e.,  length  increases,  or  negative.  Magnetostriction  plays  an  important
role in determining the preferred direction of magnetization of soft, i.e., low Hc, Ô¨Ålms such as those of alloys
of nickel and iron, known as Permalloy.
