Especially for trucks gross vehicle and axle weight monitoring is useful in an array of applications including:
Pavement design, monitoring, and research
Bridge design, monitoring, and research
Size and weight enforcement
Legislation and regulation
Administration and planning
Weigh in motion scales are often used for size and weight enforcement, such as the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's Commercial Vehicle Information Systems and Networks program. Weigh-in-motion systems can be used as part of traditional roadside inspection stations, or as part of virtual inspection stations.
Recent years have seen the rise of several "specialty" Weigh-in-Motion systems. One popular example is the front fork garbage truck scale. In this application, a container is weighed—while it is full—as the driver lifts, and again—while it is empty—as the container is returned to the ground. The difference between the full and empty weights is equal to the weight of the contents.
