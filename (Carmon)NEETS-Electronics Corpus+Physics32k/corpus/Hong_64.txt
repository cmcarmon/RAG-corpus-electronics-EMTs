Bias  refers  to  the  DC  voltage  and  current  values  in  a  circuit  in  absence  of  any 
time-varying signals. In circuits that contain nonlinear components such as transistors and 
diodes, it is usually necessary to provide a power supply with static values of voltage and 
current. These static operating parameters are known as the bias voltage and bias current 
of each device. When analyzing circuit response to signals, the circuit components are 
typically  linearized  about  their  DC  bias  voltage  and  current  and  the  input  signals  are 
considered as linear perturbations. Frequently, the AC behavior of a circuit component is 
dependent on its bias voltage and bias current.
