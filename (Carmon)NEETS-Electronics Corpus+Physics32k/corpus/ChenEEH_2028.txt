jÂ¼1 vi, we obtain the decomposition of
the vectorâ€“matrix product as stated in theorem 2 (Dutt and
Assaad, 1996):
Theorem 2: The vectorâ€“matrix product uT  B:Â¼ fB(u) Â¼
rowsum  hB(u).
Since matrix multiplication A  B is a sequence of fB(ai)
computations, one for each row of A, one can apply a man-
tissa-based integer row checksum test to the hB(ai) components
to precisely check for errors in the ï¬‚oating point multiplicant in
A  B. This integer row checksum test is as follows:
