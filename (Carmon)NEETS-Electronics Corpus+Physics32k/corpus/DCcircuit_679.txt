Since voltmeters are always connected in parallel with the component or components un-
der test, any current through the voltmeter will contribute to the overall current in the tested
circuit, potentially affecting the voltage being measured. A perfect voltmeter has inÔ¨Ånite re-
sistance, so that it draws no current from the circuit under test. However, perfect voltmeters
only exist in the pages of textbooks, not in real life! Take the following voltage divider circuit
as an extreme example of how a realistic voltmeter might impact the circuit its measuring:
