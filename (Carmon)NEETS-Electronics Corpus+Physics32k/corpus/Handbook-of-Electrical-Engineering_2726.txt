In  the  literature,  many  different  techniques  have  been  proposed  for
restricted routers. In general these techniques can be grouped into four
different approaches: 1) algorithms (such as left-edge, maze, greedy, hier-
archical); 2) expert systems; 3) neural networks; and 4) genetic algorithms
[Zobrist, 1994; Sarrafzadeh, 1996; and Lengauer, 1990]. As an example,
we consider here only one of the techniques, called a maze router which
is widely known. The maze router can be used as a global router and/or
detailed  router.  It  ﬁnds  the  shortest  rectilinear  path  by  propagating  a
wavefront  from  a  source  point  toward  a  destination  point  [Lee,  1969].
Considering the routing surface as a rectangular array of cells, the algo-
rithm starts by marking the source cell as visited. In successive steps, it
visits all the unvisited neighbors of visited cells. This continues until the
destination  cell  is  visited.  For  example,  consider  the  cell  conﬁguration
given in Fig. 25.20.
