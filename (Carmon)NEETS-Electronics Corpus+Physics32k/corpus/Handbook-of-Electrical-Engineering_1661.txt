Extended Kalman Filter
In  practical  applications,  it  is  rather  rare  to  ﬁnd  a  problem  with  dynamical  equations  and  measurement
equations that are linear in x. Nevertheless, engineers use the Kalman ﬁlter theory applied to a linear approx-
imation of the actual nonlinear dynamics and measurements. This approximation is called the extended Kalman
ﬁlter (EKF); it is very straightforward and popular. The Kalman ﬁlter itself is almost never used in real-world
applications, but rather the EKF is essentially ubiquitous.
