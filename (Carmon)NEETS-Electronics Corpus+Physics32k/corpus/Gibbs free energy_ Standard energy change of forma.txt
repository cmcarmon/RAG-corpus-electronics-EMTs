The standard Gibbs free energy of formation of a compound is the change of Gibbs free energy that accompanies the formation of 1 mole of that substance from its component elements, at their standard states (the most stable form of the element at 25 degrees Celsius and 100 kilopascals). Its symbol is ΔfG˚.
All elements in their standard states (diatomic oxygen gas, graphite, etc.) have standard Gibbs free energy change of formation equal to zero, as there is no change involved.
ΔfG = ΔfG˚ + RT ln Qf; Qf is the reaction quotient.
At equilibrium, ΔfG = 0, and Qf = K, so the equation becomes ΔfG˚ = −RT ln K; K is the equilibrium constant.
