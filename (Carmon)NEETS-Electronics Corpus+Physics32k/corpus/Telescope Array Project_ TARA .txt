The Telescope Array RADAR (TARA) Project is an effort to overcome some of the problems inherent to current cosmic ray detection techniques. Due to sun, moon and weather, fluorescence telescopes are usually limited to a ten percent duty cycle. Ground arrays can run during the day, but require a large amount of land, making it necessary to build them in remote locations. The goal of the TARA Project is to develop a bistatic radar detection system that is able to maintain a 24-hour duty cycle at a fraction of the cost of conventional detection systems.
In September 2012, the W. M. Keck Foundation awarded researchers at the University of Utah a $1 million grant to develop a bistatic radar detection system. This system will be built alongside the existing Telescope Array and will use analog television transmitters and digital receivers to observe the range, direction and strength of cosmic rays in order to trace them back to their point of origin. Once completed, this new facility will be known as the W.M. Keck Radar Observatory
