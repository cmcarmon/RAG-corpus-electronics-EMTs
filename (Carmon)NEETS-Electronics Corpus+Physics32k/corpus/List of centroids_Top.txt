The following is a list of centroids of various two-dimensional objects. The centroid of an object



X


{\displaystyle X}
in



n


{\displaystyle n}
-dimensional space is the intersection of all hyperplanes that divide



X


{\displaystyle X}
into two parts of equal moment about the hyperplane. Informally, it is the "average" of all points of



X


{\displaystyle X}
. For an object of uniform composition (mass, density, etc.) the centroid of a body is also its center of mass. In the case of two-dimensional objects shown below, the hyperplanes are simply lines.
