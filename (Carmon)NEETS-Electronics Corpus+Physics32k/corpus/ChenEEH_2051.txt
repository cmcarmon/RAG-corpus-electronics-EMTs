Although ISO/IEC (2002) has deﬁned the concepts of mark-
ings, transition enabling, and ﬁring rules, it stopped short in
deﬁning the dynamic semantics of an HLPN. In the existing
Petri net literature, there have been several semantic models of
Petri nets, such as interleaving, concurrent, and causal execu-
tions (Reisig, 1985b). From our own experience, we feel that
the interleaving set semantics model deﬁned above is adequate
for studying many useful system behavioral properties.
