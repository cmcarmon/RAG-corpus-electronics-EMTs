Problem 3.36: An Interesting and Useful Circuit
The circuit depicted in Figure 3.76 has interesting properties, which are exploited in high-performance
oscilloscopes. The portion of the circuit labeled “Oscilloscope” represents the scope’s input impedance.
R2 = 1 MΩ and C2 = 30 pF (note the label under the channel 1 input in the lab’s oscilloscopes). A probe
is a device to attach an oscilloscope to a circuit, and it has the indicated circuit inside it.
