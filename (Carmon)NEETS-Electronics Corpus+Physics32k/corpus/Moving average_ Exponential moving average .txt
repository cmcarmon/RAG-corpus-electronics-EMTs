An exponential moving average (EMA), also known as an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA), is a type of infinite impulse response filter that applies weighting factors which decrease exponentially. The weighting for each older datum decreases exponentially, never reaching zero. The graph at right shows an example of the weight decrease.
The EMA for a series Y may be calculated recursively:





S

t


=


{




Y

1


,


t
=
1




α
⋅

Y

t


+
(
1
−
α
)
⋅

S

,


t
>
1








{\displaystyle S_{t}={\begin{cases}Y_{1},&t=1\\\alpha \cdot Y_{t}+(1-\alpha )\cdot S_{t-1},&t>1\end{cases}}}

Where:
The coefficient α represents the degree of weighting decrease, a constant smoothing factor between 0 and 1. A higher α discounts older observations faster.
Yt is the value at a time period t.
St is the value of the EMA at any time period t.
S1 may be initialized in a number of different ways, most commonly by setting S1 to Y1 as shown above, though other techniques exist, such as setting S1 to an average of the first 4 or 5 observations. The importance of the S1 initialisations effect on the resultant moving average depends on α; smaller α values make the choice of S1 relatively more important than larger α values, since a higher α discounts older observations faster.
Whatever is done for S1 it assumes something about values prior to the available data and is necessarily in error. In view of this the early results should be regarded as unreliable until the iterations have had time to converge. This is sometimes called a 'spin-up' interval. One way to assess when it can be regarded as reliable is to consider the required accuracy of the result. For example, if 3% accuracy is required, initialising with Y1 and taking data after five time constants (defined above) will ensure that the calculation has converged to within 3% (only <3% of Y1 will remain in the result ). Sometimes with very small alpha, this can mean little of the result is useful. This is analogous to the problem of using a convolution filter (such as a weighted average) with a very long window.
This formulation is according to Hunter (1986). By repeated application of this formula for different times, we can eventually write St as a weighted sum of the datum points Yt, as:

for any suitable k ∈ {0, 1, 2, …} The weight of the general datum point

{\displaystyle Y_{t-i}}
is

{\displaystyle \alpha \left(1-\alpha \right)^{i-1}}
.
An alternate approach by Roberts (1959) uses Yt in lieu of Yt−1:





S

t
,

alternate



=
α
⋅

Y

t


+
(
1
−
α
)
⋅

S

t

1




{\displaystyle S_{t,{\text{ alternate}}}=\alpha \cdot Y_{t}+(1-\alpha )\cdot S_{t-1}}

This formula can also be expressed in technical analysis terms as follows, showing how the EMA steps towards the latest datum point, but only by a proportion of the difference (each time):






EMA


today


=


EMA


yesterday


+
α

[



price


today


−


EMA


yesterday



]



{\displaystyle {\text{EMA}}_{\text{today}}={\text{EMA}}_{\text{yesterday}}+\alpha \left[{\text{price}}_{\text{today}}-{\text{EMA}}_{\text{yesterday}}\right]}

Expanding out





EMA


yesterday




{\displaystyle {\text{EMA}}_{\text{yesterday}}}
each time results in the following power series, showing how the weighting factor on each datum point p1, p2, etc., decreases exponentially:

where

It can also be calculated recursively without introducing the error when initializing the first estimate (n starts from 1):

This is an infinite sum with decreasing terms.
The N periods in an N-day EMA only specify the α factor. N is not a stopping point for the calculation in the way it is in an SMA or WMA. For sufficiently large N, the first N datum points in an EMA represent about 86% of the total weight in the calculation when

The above discussion requires a bit of clarification. The sum of the weights of all the terms (i.e., infinite number of terms) in an exponential moving average is 1. The sum of the weights of



N


{\displaystyle N}
terms is



1
−
(
1
−
α

)

N
+
1




{\displaystyle 1-(1-\alpha )^{N+1}}
. Both of these sums can be derived by using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. The weight omitted after



N


{\displaystyle N}
terms is given by subtracting this from 1, and you get



1

[

)

]

=
(
1

)

N
+
1




{\displaystyle 1-\left[1-(1-\alpha )^{N+1}\right]=(1-\alpha )^{N+1}}
(this is essentially the formula given below for the weight omitted). Note that there is no "accepted" value that should be chosen for



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }
although there are some recommended values based on the application. In the above discussion, we have substituted a commonly used value for



α
=
2

/

(
N
+
1
)


{\displaystyle \alpha =2/(N+1)}
in the formula for the weight of



N


{\displaystyle N}
terms. Again, it is just a recommendation—not a requirement. If you make this substitution, and you make use of




lim

n
→
∞




(

1
+


a
n



)


n


=

e

a




{\displaystyle \lim _{n\to \infty }\left(1+{a \over n}\right)^{n}=e^{a}}
, then you get the 0.8647 approximation. Intuitively, what this is telling us is that the weight after



N


{\displaystyle N}
terms of an ``



N


{\displaystyle N}
-period" exponential moving average converges to 0.8647.
The power formula above gives a starting value for a particular day, after which the successive days formula shown first can be applied. The question of how far back to go for an initial value depends, in the worst case, on the data. Large price values in old data will affect the total even if their weighting is very small. If prices have small variations then just the weighting can be considered. The weight omitted by stopping after k terms is

For example, to have 99.9% of the weight, set above ratio equal to 0.1% and solve for k:




k
=



log

(
0.001
)


log
⁡

{\displaystyle k={\log(0.001) \over \log(1-\alpha )}}

terms should be used. Since

{\displaystyle \log \,(1-\alpha )}

{\displaystyle -2 \over N+1}
as N increases, this simplifies to approximately

{\displaystyle k\approx 3.45(N+1)\,}

for this example (99.9% weight).
