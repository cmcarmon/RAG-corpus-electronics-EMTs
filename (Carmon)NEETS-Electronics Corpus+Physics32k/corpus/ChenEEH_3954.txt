An implementation of a digital signal processing (DSP)
algorithm consists of the computer program of that algorithm
and the hardware on which the program is executed. In many
signal processing applications, real-time processing is an essen-
tial requirement. Real-time implies that the results of a signal
processing algorithm must be computed by a predeÔ¨Åned dead-
line after the inputs are sampled. For example, in a cellular
phone, the speech coding signal processing algorithm must be
executed to match the speed of normal conversation. An im-
plementation of a real-time signal processing application has
three special characteristics:
