By placing resistors R3 and R4 in the circuit, you can control the voltage 
gain, or how much the input signal is amplified — without worrying about 
the exact current gain of the specific transistor at the heart of your circuit. 
(This is truly amazing stuff!) The AC voltage gain of a transistor circuit with 
resistors as shown in Figure 10-7 is –R4/R3. The negative sign just means that 
the input signal is inverted: As the input voltage varies up and then down, the 
output voltage varies down and then up, as shown by the input and output 
signal waveforms in Figure 10-7. Before sending the output signal to, say, a 
speaker, you pass it through another blocking capacitor (C2) to remove any 
DC offset.
