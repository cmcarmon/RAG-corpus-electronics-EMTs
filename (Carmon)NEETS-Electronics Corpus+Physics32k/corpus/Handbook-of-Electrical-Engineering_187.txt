HRCI-J or Class J fuses are a more recent development. In Canada, they have become the most popular HRC
fuse speciﬁed for new installations. Both time-delay and non-time-delay characteristics are available in ratings
of 600 V with ampere ratings up to 600 A. They are constructed with dimensions much smaller than HRCI-R
or Class R fuses and have end caps or blade contacts which ﬁt into 600-V Standard or Class H-type fuse clips.
However, the fuse clips must be mounted closer together to accommodate the shorter fuse length. Its shorter
length, therefore, becomes an inherent rejection feature that does not allow insertion of Standard or HRCI-R
fuses. The blade contacts are also drilled to allow bolt-on mounting if required. CSA and UL specify these fuses
to have maximum short-circuit current-limiting Ip and  I 2t limits lower than those speciﬁed for HRCI-R and
HRCII-C fuses. HRCI-J fuses may be used for a wide variety of applications. The time-delay type is commonly
used in motor circuits sized at approximately 125 to 150% of motor full-load current.
