In practice, J (uk) is divided into J (uk) ¼ [J1(uk), J2(uk)],
with J1(uk) corresponding to the block-diagonal terms and
J2(uk) the last block matrix column in J (uk). Solving the LLS
problems with J2(uk) and J1(uk) thus corresponds to updating
the denominator a and the numerators bjk estimations. More-
over, due to its block-diagonal structure, the LLS problem with
J1(uk) should be further decomposed (i.e., the LLS solutions of
bjk are independently solved for each j and k). Thus, the
computational cost of the optimization algorithm is signiﬁ-
cantly reduced.
