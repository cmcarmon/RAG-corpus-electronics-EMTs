The helium atom consists of two electrons with mass m and electric charge −e, around an essentially fixed nucleus of mass M ≫ m and charge +2e. The Hamiltonian for it, neglecting the fine structure, is:

{\displaystyle H=-{\frac {\hbar ^{2}}{2m}}(\nabla _{1}^{2}+\nabla _{2}^{2})-{\frac {e^{2}}{4\pi \epsilon _{0}}}\left({\frac {2}{r_{1}}}+{\frac {2}{r_{2}}}-{\frac {1}{|\mathbf {r} _{1}-\mathbf {r} _{2}|}}\right)}

where ħ is the reduced Planck constant, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, ri (for i = 1, 2) is the distance of the i-th electron from the nucleus, and |r1 − r2| is the distance between the two electrons.
If the term Vee = e2/(4πε0|r1 − r2|), representing the repulsion between the two electrons, were excluded, the Hamiltonian would become the sum of two hydrogen-like atom Hamiltonians with nuclear charge +2e. The ground state energy would then be 8E1 = −109 eV, where E1 is the Rydberg constant, and its ground state wavefunction would be the product of two wavefunctions for the ground state of hydrogen-like atoms:

{\displaystyle \psi (\mathbf {r} _{1},\mathbf {r} _{2})={\frac {Z^{3}}{\pi a_{0}^{3}}}e^{-Z(r_{1}+r_{2})/a_{0}}.}

where a0 is the Bohr radius and Z = 2, helium's nuclear charge. The expectation value of the total Hamiltonian H (including the term Vee) in the state described by ψ0 will be an upper bound for its ground state energy. <Vee> is −5E1/2 = 34 eV, so <H> is 8E1 − 5E1/2 = −75 eV.
A tighter upper bound can be found by using a better trial wavefunction with 'tunable' parameters. Each electron can be thought to see the nuclear charge partially "shielded" by the other electron, so we can use a trial wavefunction equal with an "effective" nuclear charge Z < 2: The expectation value of H in this state is:

{\displaystyle \langle H\rangle =\left[-2Z^{2}+{\frac {27}{4}}Z\right]E_{1}}

This is minimal for Z = 27/16; Shielding reduces the effective charge to ~1.69. Substituting this value of Z into the expression for H yields 729E1/128 = −77.5 eV, within 2% of the experimental value, −78.975 eV.
Even closer estimations of this energy have been found using more complicated trial wave functions with more parameters. This is done in physical chemistry via variational Monte Carlo.
