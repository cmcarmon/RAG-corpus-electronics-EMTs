pipe  or  other  metal  object  that’s  connected 
to earth ground. If this connection is missing, 
the ground is said to be floating (or a floating 
ground)  and  the  circuit  may  be  dangerous. 
You’d be wise to stay away from such a circuit 
until it is safely grounded (or “earthed,” as folks 
say in the UK)!
Common  ground,  or  simply  common,  isn’t  a 
physical  ground;  rather,  it’s  just  a  reference 
point  in  a  circuit  for  voltage  measurements. 
Certain types of circuits, particularly the cir-
cuits commonly used in computers, label the 
negative  terminal  of  a  DC  power  supply  the 
common ground, and connect the positive ter-
minal of another DC power supply to the same 
point. That way, the circuit is said to have both 
positive and negative power supplies. The two 
physical power supplies may be identical, but 
the way you connect them in a circuit and the 
point you choose for the zero voltage reference 
determine whether a supply voltage is positive 
or negative. It’s all relative!
