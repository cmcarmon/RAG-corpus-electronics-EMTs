This particular multimeter has several basic voltage measurement ranges: 2.5 volts, 10
volts, 50 volts, 250 volts, 500 volts, and 1000 volts. With the use of the voltage range extender
unit at the top of the multimeter, voltages up to 5000 volts can be measured. Suppose the
meter operator chose to switch the meter into the ”volt” function and plug the red test lead
into the 10 volt jack. To interpret the needle’s position, he or she would have to read the scale
ending with the number ”10”. If they moved the red test plug into the 250 volt jack, however,
they would read the meter indication on the scale ending with ”2.5”, multiplying the direct
indication by a factor of 100 in order to ﬁnd what the measured voltage was.
