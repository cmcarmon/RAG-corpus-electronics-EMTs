Because Kendrick mass defect analysis can be carried out by substituting any repeating unit for CH2, KMD analysis is particularly useful for the visualizing the data from polymer mass spectra. For example, a Kendrick mass defect plot of an ethylene oxide/propylene oxide copolymer can be created by using ethylene oxide (C2H4O) as the base unit and calculating the Kendrick mass as:






Kendrick~mass


=


IUPAC~mass


Ã—


44.00000
44.02621




{\displaystyle {\textrm {Kendrick~mass}}={\textrm {IUPAC~mass}}\times {\frac {44.00000}{44.02621}}}

where 44.02621 is the calculated IUPAC mass for C2H4O. Alternatively, a KMD plot can be constructed for the same copolymer by using propylene oxide as the base unit.
Polymer mass spectra containing multiple charge ions exhibit isotopic splitting.
