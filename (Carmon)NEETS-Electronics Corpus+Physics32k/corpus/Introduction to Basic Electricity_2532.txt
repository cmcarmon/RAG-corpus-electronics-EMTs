A frequency	counter (Figure 22-11) measures fre-
quency by comparing a known frequency against an 
input frequency. All frequency counters consist of 
the same basic sections: a time base, an input-signal 
 conditioner, a gate-control circuit, a main gate, a 
 decade counter, and a display (Figure 22-12). The signal  
conditioner converts the input signal to a wave shape 
and amplitude compatible with the circuitry in the 
counter. The main gate passes the conditioned input 
signal to the counter circuit if a signal from the time 
base is present at the same time. The time base drives 
the gate-control circuit, using a signal compatible with
