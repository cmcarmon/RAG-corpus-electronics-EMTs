Figure 12.1.2 Circuit conven-
tions. (a) Load (or sink or motor)
convention. Note that the power
absorbed by the circuit is posi-
tive when v and i are positive, and
when current ﬂows in the direc-
tion of voltage drop. (b) Source
(or generator) convention. Note
that the power delivered by this
circuit to the external circuit is
positive when v and i are posi-
tive, and when current ﬂows out
of the positive terminal.
