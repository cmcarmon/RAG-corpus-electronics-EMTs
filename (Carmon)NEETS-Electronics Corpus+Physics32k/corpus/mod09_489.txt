Refer again to figure 3-50, view (A) and view (B). From T0 to T1, C2 begins charging toward 50 
volts through R2 and R3. The time constant for this circuit is 10 milliseconds. If the input gate is 1,000 
microseconds, the capacitor can charge for only 10 percent of 1TC, and the sawtooth part of the 
trapezoidal wave will be linear.
