Tenseigan (転生眼, lit. "Reincarnation Eye") refers to two different concepts: an eye technique and an object. The eye technique first manifested in Hamura Ōtsutsuki, the son of the first known Byakugan user, Kaguya. His descendants, the Hyūga and the Ōtsutsuki clans both inherit only Byakugan, but by combining the two bloodlines their Byakugan will evolve into Tenseigan (similar to the Senju and Uchiha clan combination required to obtain Rinnegan). It is characterized by a blue pupil surrounded by a blue-and-white flower-like iris. The Tenseigan allows the user to control both attractive and repulsive forces, similar to the Rinnegan. Additionally, it also grants the wielder Tenseigan Chakra Mode, which in turn gives the user an increase in speed, power, strength, durability, and reflexes. It also grants its user Truth-Seeking Balls, thus granting the user all five nature transformations and Yin-Yang Style. Thou the tenseigan may have other abilities but they are Yet to be seen since the only seen user of the dojūtsu is toneri ōtsutsuki
The second concept is a huge energy vessel hidden in the world inside the Moon and protected by the Ōtsutsuki clan. It is a yellow sun-like object with a double-layered hexagonal pupil surrounded by orange flower-like iris. The center of the core also contains Hamura's Tenseigan. The object is stored within a spherical case attached to Hamura's shrine. It can only be touched by someone who possesses "the undiluted chakra of Hamura". The vessel is a highly powerful object as it supports the life of the hollow world by providing the artificial sun. It was also used in warfare by the feuding main and branch families of the Ǒtsutsuki clan. However, to support the vessel, all Ōtsutsuki clan members have to give up and combine their Byakugan within the vessel. This includes Toneri, the last surviving member of the clan.
