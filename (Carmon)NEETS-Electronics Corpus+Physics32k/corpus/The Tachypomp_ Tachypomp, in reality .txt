Though an interesting idea in theory, the special theory of relativity dictates that the speed of light in a vacuum is absolute and represents an ultimate speed limit for the universe (at least locally). If a Tachypomp were constructed, relativistic principles such as length contraction and time dilation would prevent any component of the system from achieving or exceeding the speed of light.
It is worth noting that the story "The Tachypomp" was written and published before these relativistic effects were laid out by Albert Einstein in 1905. Therefore, the final line of the story, "Still I can see no reason why the Tachypomp should not have succeeded. Can you?" was likely meant in earnest by the author.
