Previous research (Neves and Friedman, 1996a, 1996b)
has indicated that tight control over the clock skews rather
than the clock delays is necessary for the circuit to operate
reliably. The timing constraints of sequentially adjacent pairs
of registers are used to determine a permissible range of allow-
able clock skew for each signal path (Friedman, 1995; Neves and
Friedman, 1996a, 1996b; Afghani and Svensson, 1990; Kourtev,
1999). The concept of a permissible range for the clock skew sk
of a data path Ri?Rf is illustrated in Figure 4.2.
