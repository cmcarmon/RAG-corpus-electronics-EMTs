Figure 44-25 shows a typical 4-bit shift register 
constructed of JK flip-flops. The serial data and their 
complements are applied to the JK inputs of the A flip-
flop. The other flip-flops are cascaded, with the out-
puts of one connected to the inputs of the next. The 
toggles of all the flip-flops are connected together, and 
the clock pulse is applied to this line. Because all the 
flip-flops are toggled together, this is a synchronous 
circuit. Also, the clear inputs of each flip-flop are tied 
together to form a reset line. Data applied to the in-
put are shifted through the flip-flops 1 bit position for 
each clock pulse. For example, if the binary number 
1011 is applied to the input of the shift register and a 
shift pulse is applied, the number stored in the shift 
register is shifted out and lost while the external num-
ber is shifted in. Figure 44-26 shows the sequence of 
events for storing a number in the shift register.
