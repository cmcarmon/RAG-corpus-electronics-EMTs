away from their normal ”levels,” creating a condition where a force exists between the wax
and wool, as the electrons seek to re-establish their former positions (and balance within their
respective atoms). The force attracting electrons back to their original positions around the
positive nuclei of their atoms is analogous to the force gravity exerts on water in the reservoir,
trying to draw it down to its former level.
