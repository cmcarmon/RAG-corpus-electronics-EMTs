Gather up a few other items, such as safety glasses (to protect your eyes 
from sputtering solder), an alligator clip (which doubles as a heat sink for 
temperature‐sensitive components), an antistatic wristband (described in 
Chapter 13), isopropyl alcohol, a piece of paper, a pencil, and some sticky 
tape. Place each part that you need to solder on the paper, securing it with 
sticky tape. Write a label, such as R1, on the paper next to each part so it 
matches the label on your schematic. Put on your safety glasses and anti-
static wristband, and make sure your work area is properly ventilated.
