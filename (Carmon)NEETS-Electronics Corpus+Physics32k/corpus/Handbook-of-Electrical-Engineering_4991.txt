The breakdown strength under dc and impulse conditions tends to exceed that at ac Ô¨Åelds, thereby suggesting
the ac breakdown process may be partially of a thermal nature. An additional factor, which may lower the ac
breakdown strength, is that associated with the occurrence of partial discharges either in void inclusions or at
the  electrode  edges;  this  leads  to  breakdown  values  very  much  less  than  the  intrinsic  value.  In  practice,  the
breakdowns are generally of an extrinsic nature, and the intrinsic values are useful conceptually insofar as they
provide an idea of an upper value that can be attained only under ideal conditions. The intrinsic breakdown
theories were essentially developed for crystalline dielectrics, for which it was assumed that a very small number
