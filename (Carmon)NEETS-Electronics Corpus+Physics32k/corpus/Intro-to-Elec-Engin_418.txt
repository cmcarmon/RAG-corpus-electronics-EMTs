The voltage gain is independent of the op-amp parameters. By selecting the resistors
to achieve the desired ratio, constructing a linear ampliﬁer with a prescribed voltage
gain is rather simple. It may further be noted that the output impedance is Zo =
0, with zero output impedance of the ideal op amp; the input impedance is Zi =
vi / ii = Ri.
