This method of showing connections isn’t universal, so you have to figure 
out which wires connect and which don’t by checking the drawing style 
used in the schematic. If you see an intersection of two lines without a dot to 
positively identify a real connection, you simply cannot be sure whether the 
wires should be connected or not. It’s best to consult with the person who 
drew the schematic to determine how to interpret the crisscrossing lines.
