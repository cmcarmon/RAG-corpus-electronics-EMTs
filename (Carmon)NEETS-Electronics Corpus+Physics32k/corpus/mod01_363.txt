The Magnesium-Manganese Dioxide Cell uses magnesium as the anode material. This allows a 
higher output capacity over an extended period of time compared to the zinc-carbon cell. This cell 
produces a voltage of approximately 2 volts. The disadvantage of this type of cell is the production of 
hydrogen during its operation.
