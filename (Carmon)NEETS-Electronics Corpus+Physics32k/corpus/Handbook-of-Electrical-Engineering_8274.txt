Fault Models
At  the  defect  level,  an  enormous  number  of  different  failures  could  be  present,  and  it  is  totally  infeasible  to
analyze  them  as  such.  Thus  failures  are  grouped  together  with  regards  to  their  logical  fault  effect  on  the
functionality  of  the  circuit,  and  this  leads  to  the  construction  of  logical  fault  models  as  the  basis  for  testing

algorithms [Abramovici et al.,
 is deÔ¨Åned as the condition (or
effect
state) of a system containing a fault (deviation from correct state). Faults can be further divided into classes,
permanent 
faults,  that  is,  faults  in  existence  long  enough  to  be
as  shown  in  Fig. 85.2.  Here  we  discuss  only 
 faults (transient or intermittent), which appear and disappear
observed at test time, as opposed to 
 faults, which affect the operating speed of the circuit. Moreover we do not
in short intervals of time, or 
, which cause a combinational circuit to behave like a sequential one, as they are mainly

restricted to certain technologies (e.g., CMOS).
