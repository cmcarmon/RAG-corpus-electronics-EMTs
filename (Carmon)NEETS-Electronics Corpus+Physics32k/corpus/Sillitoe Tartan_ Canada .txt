Use of the Sillitoe Tartan is rare in Canada and is usually limited to auxiliary police services. For example, the Toronto Police Auxiliary wear a red and black chequered band on their caps.
A two-row Chicago-style Sillitoe tartan is borne on the high-visibility vests of the Vancouver Police and Metro Vancouver Transit Police (along the edges of the horizontal and vertical reflective strips), but not on their high-visibility jackets nor other uniforms.
