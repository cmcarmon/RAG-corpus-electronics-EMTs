Figure 13.3.2 Four possible cases of operation of a round-rotor synchronous machine with negligible armature
resistance. (a) Overexcited generator (power factor lagging), P > 0, Q > 0, δ > 0. (b) Underexcited
generator (power factor leading), P > 0, Q < 0, δ > 0. (c) Overexcited motor (power factor leading),
P < 0, Q > 0, δ < 0. (d) Underexcited motor (power factor lagging), P < 0, Q < 0, δ < 0.
