difﬁcult than those functions for integrated circuits. The fact
that MEMS are newer than ICs and have lower volume further
complicates these functions for MEMS. It is widely reported
that the packaging of MEMS is often more than half, some-
times 90%, of the cost of the devices. Similar general ﬁgures
for the testing and calibration of MEMS do not seem to be
available.
