Surface sources given by tangential components of incident ﬁeld, with ﬁelds subsequently 
propagated via a Green’s function. Best for backscatter and main-lobe region of reﬂector 
antennas, from resonance region (
Combines aspects of physical optics and geometrical theory of diffraction, primarily via use of
edge-current corrections to utilize best features of each.
Fields propagated via a divergence factor with amplitude obtained from diffraction coefﬁcient.
 Generally applicable for 
Ray tracing without diffraction. Improves with increasing frequency.
Solution obtained in terms of perturbation from a reference, known solution.
Approach used for low-contrast, penetrable objects where sources are estimated from incident 
ﬁeld.
Fields at surface of object represented in terms of only outward propagating components in a 
modal expansion.
