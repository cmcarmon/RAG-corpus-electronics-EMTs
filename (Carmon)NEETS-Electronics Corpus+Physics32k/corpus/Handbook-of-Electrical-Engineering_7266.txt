Technology Alternatives in Meeting Customer Requirements
Infrared and Spread Spectrum Technologies Lack Performance
Developing the ideal system, obviously, is no trivial problem. Several wireless network products, to be sure, are
available,  but  many  suffer  from  limited  performance  and  operational  problems  inherent  to  the  technologies
on which they are based. As such, they are perhaps interim point solutions, primarily for small networks but
are not the long-term answer to the wire communications dilemma described earlier.
