A practical use of the directional characteristic of the magnet is the compass, a device in which a
freely rotating magnetized needle indicator points toward the North Pole. The realization that the poles of
a suspended magnet always move to a definite position gives an indication that the opposite poles of a
magnet have opposite magnetic polarity.
