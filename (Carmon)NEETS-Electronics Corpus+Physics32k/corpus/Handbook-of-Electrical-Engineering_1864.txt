The challenges of processing streaming data in realtime are made greater by the fact that video processing
algorithms are becoming very complex. Video compression algorithms make use of several different techniques
and  complex  search  algorithms  to  maximize  their  ability  to  compress  the  video  data;  video  display  systems
provide much more sophisticated controls to the user; content analysis systems make use of multiple complex
algorithms  working  together;  mixed  computer  graphics-video  systems  combine  geometric  algorithms  with
traditional video algorithms. Expect video processing algorithms to become more complex in the future. This
complexity puts greater demands on the realtime nature of the video architecture: more complex algorithms
generally have less predictable execution times. The architecture should be designed so that algorithms can take
advantage of idle hardware caused by early completions of functions, rather than letting hardware sit idle while
it waits for other operations to complete.
