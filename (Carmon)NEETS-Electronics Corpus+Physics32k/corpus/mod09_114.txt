By now you know that we have just ignored our old friend resistance from previous discussions. In 
an actual circuit, at resonance, the currents will not quite counteract each other because each component 
will have different resistance. This resistance is kept extremely low, but it is still there. The result is that a 
relatively small current flows from the source at resonance instead of zero current. Therefore, a basic 
characteristic of a practical parallel-LC circuit is that, at resonance, the circuit has MAXIMUM 
impedance which results in MINIMUM current from the source. This current is often called line current. 
This is shown by the peak of the waveform for impedance and the valley for the line current, both 
occurring at fr the frequency of resonance in figure 1-11.
