As we have seen in Chapter 10, three-phase transformers are used quite extensively in power
systems between generators and transmission systems, between transmission and subtransmission
systems, and between subtransmission and distribution systems. Most commercial and industrial
loads require three-phase transformers to transform the three-phase distribution voltage to the
ultimate utilization level.
