Some sundials both decline and recline, in that their shadow-receiving plane is not oriented with a cardinal direction (such as true North or true South) and is neither horizontal nor vertical nor equatorial. For example, such a sundial might be found on a roof that was not oriented in a cardinal direction.
The formulae describing the spacing of the hour-lines on such dials are rather more complicated than those for simpler dials.
There are various solution approaches, including some using the methods of rotation matrices, and some making a 3D model of the reclined-declined plane and its vertical declined counterpart plane, extracting the geometrical relationships between the hour angle components on both these planes and then reducing the trigonometric algebra.
One system of formulas for Reclining-Declining sundials: (as stated by Fennewick)
The angle

RD




{\displaystyle H_{\text{RD}}}
between the noon hour-line and another hour-line is given by the formula below. Note that

Here



L


{\displaystyle L}
is the sundial's geographical latitude;




s

o




{\displaystyle s_{o}}
is the orientation switch integer; t is the time in hours before or after noon; and



R


{\displaystyle R}
and



D


{\displaystyle D}
are the angles of reclination and declination, respectively. Note that



R


{\displaystyle R}
is measured with reference to the vertical. It is positive when the dial leans back towards the horizon behind the dial and negative when the dial leans forward to the horizon on the sun's side. Declination angle



D


{\displaystyle D}
is defined as positive when moving east of true south. Dials facing fully or partly south have




s

o




{\displaystyle s_{o}}
= +1, while those partly or fully north-facing have an




s

o




{\displaystyle s_{o}}
value of -1. Since the above expression gives the hour angle as an arctan function, due consideration must be given to which quadrant of the sundial each hour belongs to before assigning the correct hour angle.
Unlike the simpler vertical declining sundial, this type of dial does not always show hour angles on its sunside face for all declinations between east and west. When a northern hemisphere partly south-facing dial reclines back (i.e. away from the sun) from the vertical, the gnomon will become co-planar with the dial plate at declinations less than due east or due west. Likewise for southern hemisphere dials that are partly north-facing. Were these dials reclining forward, the range of declination would actually exceed due east and due west. In a similar way, northern hemisphere dials that are partly north-facing and southern hemisphere dials that are south-facing, and which lean forward toward their upward pointing gnomons, will have a similar restriction on the range of declination that is possible for a given reclination value. The critical declination




D

c




{\displaystyle D_{c}}
is a geometrical constraint which depends on the value of both the dial's reclination and its latitude :
