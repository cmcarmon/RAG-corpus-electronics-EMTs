The abnormal operating conditions that the system may
experience are rare but do happen. They include lightning
striking the transmission lines during severe weather storms,
excessive loading and environmental conditions, deterioration
or breakdown of the equipment insulation, and intrusions by
humans and/or animals. As a result, power systems may
experience occasional faults. The faults may be deﬁned as
events that have contributed to a violation of the design limits
for the power system components regarding insulation, gal-
vanic isolation, voltage and current level, power rating, and
other such requirements. The faults occur randomly and may
be associated with any component of the power system. As a
result, the power component experiences an exceptional stress,
and unless disconnected or de-energized, the component may
be damaged beyond repair. In general, the longer the duration
of a fault, the larger is the damage. The fault conditions may
affect the overall power system operation since the faulted
component needs to be removed, which in turn may contrib-
ute to violation of the stability and/or loading limits. Last, but
not least, the faults may present a life threat to humans and
animals since the damage caused by the faults may reduce
safety limits otherwise satisﬁed for normal operating condi-
tions. Protective relaying was introduced in practice as early as
the ﬁrst power systems were invented to make sure that faults
are detected and damaged components are taken out of service
quickly.
