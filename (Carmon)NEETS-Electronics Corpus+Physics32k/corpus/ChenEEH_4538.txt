Classically, in circuit and system theory, connections are
represented by some type of graph (e.g., linear graph, bond
graph, signal ï¬‚ow graph) or block diagram. This graphical
depiction of connection information can readily be converted
into a set of linear algebraic constraints on the circuit or system
variables for subsequent analysis. As such, it is natural to adopt
an algebraic model of the connections from the start.
