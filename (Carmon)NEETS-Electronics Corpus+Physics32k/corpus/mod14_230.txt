We can demonstrate the operation of the AND gate with a simple circuit that has two switches in
series as shown in figure 2-3. You can see that both switches would have to be closed at the same time to
light the lamp (view A). Any other combination of switch positions (view B) would result in an open
circuit and the lamp would not light (logic 0).
