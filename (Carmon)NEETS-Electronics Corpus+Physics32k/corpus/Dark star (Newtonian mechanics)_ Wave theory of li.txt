In 1796, the mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace promoted the same idea in the first and second editions of his book Exposition du syst√®me du Monde, independently of Michell.
Because of the development of the wave theory of light, Laplace may have removed it from later editions as light became to be thought of as a massless wave, and therefore not influenced by gravity and as a group, physicists dropped the idea although the German physicist, mathematician, and astronomer Johann Georg von Soldner continued with Newton's corpuscular theory of light as late as 1804.
