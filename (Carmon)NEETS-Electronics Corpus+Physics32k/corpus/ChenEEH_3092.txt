where~EE is the electric ﬁeld and ~BB is the magnetic ﬂux density. This
law states that the voltage induced in a loop is equal to the time
rate of change of the ﬂux linking the loop. The negative sign
indicates that the voltage is induced such that the current would
oppose the change in ﬂux linkage. The change in ﬂux linkage can
be caused by a change in ﬂux density and/or a change in geometry.
