In the CODATA set of recommended values for physical constants, the Loschmidt constant is calculated from the gas constant and the Avogadro constant:

where Ar(e) is the relative atomic mass of the electron, Mu is the molar mass constant, c is the speed of light, α is the fine structure constant, R∞ is the Rydberg constant and h is the Planck constant. The pressure and temperature can be chosen freely, and must be quoted with values of the Loschmidt constant. The precision to which the Loschmidt constant is currently known is limited entirely by the uncertainty in the value of the gas constant.
