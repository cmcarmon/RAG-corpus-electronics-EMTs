The ﬁrst condition guarantees that the closed-loop system
has no unstable hidden modes. The second condition gives a
MIMO generalization of the Nyquist plot in terms of the
determinant of I þ Lo(s). Because of the determinant, the
Nyquist plot of a scalar times I þ Lo(s) is not simply a scaled
version of the Nyquist plot of jI þ Lo(s)j.
