Positive ﬂashes to ground, those initiated in the cloud and lowering positive charge to earth, generally contain
only one return stroke, which is preceded by a “pulsating” leader rather than the stepped leader characteristically
preceding negative ﬁrst strokes and is generally followed by a period of continuous current ﬂow. Positive ﬂashes
contain a greater percentage of very large return stroke currents, in the 100- to 300-kA range, than do negative
ﬂashes. Positive ﬂashes may represent half of all ﬂashes to ground in winter storms, which produce few total
ﬂashes, and typically represent 1 to 20% of the overall ﬂashes in summer storms, that percentage increasing
with increasing latitude.
