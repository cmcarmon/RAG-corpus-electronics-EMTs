FIGURE 1.6 Percentage of Average Activity Reduction from Use of LNS. The percentage is compared to n-bit and to neq-bit linear ﬁxed-point
system for various bases b of the logarithm. The diagram reveals that the optimal selection of b depends on n, and it can lead to signiﬁcant power
dissipation reduction.
