{\displaystyle y_{t}=a_{1}y_{t-1}+\cdots +a_{n}y_{t-n}+b}

is said to be non-homogeneous. To solve this equation it is convenient to convert it to homogeneous form, with no constant term. This is done by first finding the equation's steady state value—a value y * such that, if n successive iterates all had this value, so would all future values. This value is found by setting all values of y equal to y * in the difference equation, and solving, thus obtaining

{\displaystyle y^{*}={\frac {b}{1-a_{1}-\cdots -a_{n}}},}

assuming the denominator is not 0. If it is zero, the steady state does not exist.
Given the steady state, the difference equation can be rewritten in terms of deviations of the iterates from the steady state, as
