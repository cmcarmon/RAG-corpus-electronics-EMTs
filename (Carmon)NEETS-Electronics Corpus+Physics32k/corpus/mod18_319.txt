Failure of the tr tube is primarily caused by two factors. The first and most common cause of failure
is the gradual buildup of metal particles that have been dislodged from the electrodes. Such metal bits
become spattered on the inside of the glass envelope. These particles act as small, conducting areas and
tend to lower the Q of the resonant cavity and dissipate power. If the tube continues in use for too long a
