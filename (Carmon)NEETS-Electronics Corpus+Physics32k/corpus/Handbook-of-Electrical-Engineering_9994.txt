Autotuning in Process Control
In 1943 Ziegler and Nichols [1943] suggested a technique for tuning the parameters of a PID controller. Their
method was based on testing the plant in a closed loop with the PID controller in the proportional mode. The
proportional gain was increased until the loop started to oscillate and then the value of gain and the oscillation
frequency were measured. Formulae were given for setting the controller parameters based on the gain named
the critical gain, Kc, and the frequency called the critical frequency, w
c.
