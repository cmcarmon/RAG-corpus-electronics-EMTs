Keeping up to date with developments in CACSD is not always easy but the proceedings of the triennual IFAC
symposium  on  Computer-Aided  Design  in  Control  Systems  (CADCS)  and  the  IEEE  biennual  workshop  on
CACSD are useful indicators of the latest trends. The proceedings of the last three of these meetings are given
below. The other items give useful snapshots of the state-of-the-art at various points in the last 10 years or so.
In addition to these sources, the 
 regularly publishes articles on CACSD and is
a good place to look for other information.
