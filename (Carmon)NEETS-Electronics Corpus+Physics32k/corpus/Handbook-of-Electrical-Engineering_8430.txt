Signed-Magnitude Representation
A signed-magnitude number consists of a magnitude together with a symbol indicating its sign (positive or
negative). Such a number lies in the decimal range of –(r n–1 – 1) through +(r n–1 – 1) for n integer digits in
radix r. A fraction portion, if present, would consist of m digits to the right of the radix point.
