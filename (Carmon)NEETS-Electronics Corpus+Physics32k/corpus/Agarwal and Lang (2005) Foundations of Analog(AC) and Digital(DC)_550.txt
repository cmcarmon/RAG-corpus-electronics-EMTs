Two closing comments: First, note that the identity of all voltages and currents inside
the network that is replaced by the Thévenin or Norton circuit in general lose their
identity; only the terminal voltage and current are preserved. Thus, for example, the
current through R3 in Figure 3.90a does not appear as any identifiable current flowing
in the Thévenin circuit in Figure 3.90e. Second, if one wishes to measure the Thévenin
or Norton parameters of a system in the laboratory, two independent measurements
are required in order to specify the two parameters in the model. In addition, certain
practical issues must be faced. For example, it is unwise, in fact dangerous, to apply a
short circuit to a large battery such as an automobile storage battery in an attempt to
measure the short-circuit current as suggested in Figure 3.75b. A better procedure is to
first measure the open-circuit voltage, then measure the terminal voltage when some
known resistor is connected to the battery. These two measurements can then be used
to find Rt.
