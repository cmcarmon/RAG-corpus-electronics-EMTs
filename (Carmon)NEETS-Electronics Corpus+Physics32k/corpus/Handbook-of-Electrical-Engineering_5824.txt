are interconnected by the feeders (lines or cables). Circuit breakers (CBs) are installed at both ends of the feeder
for short-circuit protection. The loads are connected directly to the feeders through fuses. The connection is
similar to the one-line diagram of the high-voltage network shown in Fig. 65.1. The high cost of the network
limits  its  application.  A  more  economical  and  fairly  reliable  arrangement  is  the  loop  connection,  when  the
main  feeder  is  supplied  from  two  independent  distribution  substations.  These  stations  share  the  load.  The
problem with this connection is the circulating current that occurs when the two supply station voltages are
different. The loop arrangement signiÔ¨Åcantly improves system reliability.
