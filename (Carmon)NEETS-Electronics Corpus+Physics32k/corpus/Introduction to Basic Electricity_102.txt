The	Law	of	Induction	by	Michael	Faraday	is	a	fundamental	law	that	revolves
around	the	field	of	a	circuit	and	the	possible	elements	that	are	subject	to	eventual
interaction.	It	carries	both	qualitative	and	quantitative	aspects,	and	proposes	that
only	with	the	presence	of	an	infinite	source	of	inductors	can	a	circuit	retain	its
inductive	capability.
Unfortunately,	not	all	circuit	engineers	and	scientists	are	one	with	Michael
Faraday	and	his	Law	of	Induction.	It	is	argued	that	although	it	holds	some	matters
true,	especially	where	loops	of	wire	are	concerned,	it	can	yield	the	wrong	results	if
used	extensively;	it	can	only	handle	a	certain	field	and	is	usually	arbitrarily	small.
In	fact,	counterexamples	were	previously	presented.
A	counterexample	of	Faraday’s	Law	of	Induction	is	the	case	involving	an	electric
disc	generator.	Due	to	its	own	magnetic	field,	it	can	rotate	circularly	at	a	specified
angular	rate;	it	can	complete	a	rotation	and	in	the	process,	induct	electricity	by
distributing	it	to	other	areas	(within	the	circuit).	It	can	be	deduced	that	although	the
circuit’s	shape	has	remained	constant	over	a	period	of	time	and	although	it	can
induct	electricity,	its	distributive	method	made	it	lose	inductive	capabilities.
