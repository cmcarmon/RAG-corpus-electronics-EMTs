The most commonly used BJT equivalent circuit for investigating the dynamical responses to small input
signals  is  the  hybrid-pi  model  offered  in  Fig.  28.11  [Sedra  and  Smith,  1987].  In  this  model,  Rb,  Rc,  and  Re,
respectively, represent the internal base, collector, and emitter resistances of the considered BJT. Although these
series  resistances  vary  somewhat  with  quiescent  operating  point  [de  Graaf,  1969],  they  can  be  viewed  as
constants in Ô¨Årst-order manual analyses.
