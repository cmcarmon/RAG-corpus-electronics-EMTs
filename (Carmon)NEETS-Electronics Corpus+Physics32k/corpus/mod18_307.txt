Whenever a single antenna is used for both transmitting and receiving, as in a radar system,
problems arise. Switching the antenna between the transmit and receive modes presents one problem;
ensuring that maximum use is made of the available energy is another. The simplest solution is to use a
switch to transfer the antenna connection from the receiver to the transmitter during the transmitted pulse
and back to the receiver during the return (echo) pulse. No practical mechanical switches are available
that can open and close in a few microseconds. Therefore, ELECTRONIC SWITCHES must be used.
Switching systems of this type are called DUPLEXERS.
