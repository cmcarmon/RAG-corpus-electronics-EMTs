A dc high-voltage probe is available for use with the multimeter. The probe extends the range of the
multimeter in a safe and convenient manner. It is primarily used to measure high-voltage, low-power, dc-
current sources, such as the anode supplies in television receivers and other cathode-ray tube circuitry.
