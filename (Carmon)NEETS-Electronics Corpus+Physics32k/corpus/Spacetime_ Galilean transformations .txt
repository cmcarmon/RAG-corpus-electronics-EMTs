A basic goal is to be able to compare measurements made by observers in relative motion. Say we have an observer O in frame S who has measured the time and space coordinates of an event, assigning this event three Cartesian coordinates and the time as measured on his lattice of synchronized clocks (x, y, z, t) (see Fig. 1‑1). A second observer O′ in a different frame S′ measures the same event in her coordinate system and her lattice of synchronized clocks (x′, y′, z′, t′). Since we are dealing with inertial frames, neither observer is under acceleration, and a simple set of equations allows us to relate coordinates (x, y, z, t) to (x′, y′, z′, t′). Given that the two coordinate systems are in standard configuration, meaning that they are aligned with parallel (x, y, z) coordinates and that t = 0 when t′ = 0, the coordinate transformation is as follows:





x

x
−
v

{\displaystyle x'=x-vt}






y

y


{\displaystyle y'=y}






z

{\displaystyle z'=z}

{\displaystyle t'=t.}


Fig. 3-1 illustrates that in Newton's theory, time is universal, not the velocity of light. Consider the following thought experiment: The red arrow illustrates a train that is moving at 0.4 c with respect to the platform. Within the train, a passenger shoots a bullet with a speed of 0.4 c in the frame of the train. The blue arrow illustrates that a person standing on the train tracks measures the bullet as traveling at 0.8 c. This is in accordance with our naive expectations.
More generally, assume that frame S′ is moving at velocity v with respect to frame S. Within frame S′, observer O′ measures an object moving with velocity u′. What is its velocity u with respect to frame S? Since x = ut, x′ = x − vt, and t = t′, we can write x′ = ut − vt = (u − v)t = (u − v)t′. This leads to u′ = x′/t′ and ultimately





u
′

=
u
−
v


{\displaystyle u'=u-v}
or



u

u

+
v
,


{\displaystyle u=u'+v,}

which is the common-sense Galilean law for the addition of velocities.
