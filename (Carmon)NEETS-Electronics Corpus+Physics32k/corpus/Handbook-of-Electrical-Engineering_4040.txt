The single-point ground is a single physical point in a circuit. By connecting all grounds to a common point,
no  interference  will  be  produced  in  the  equipment  because  the  conÔ¨Åguration  does  not  result  in  potential
differences across the equipment. At high frequencies care must be taken to prevent capacitive coupling, which
will result in interference.
