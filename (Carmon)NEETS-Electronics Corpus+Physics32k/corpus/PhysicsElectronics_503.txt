The high-frequency operation of the common emitter ampliﬁer is limited by the parasitic
capacitance between the collector and base. This capacitance provides a path by which
the large and inverted signal at the collector drives a feedback current into the base. The
base-to-collector voltage gain of this ampliﬁer looks like a low-pass ﬁlter.
