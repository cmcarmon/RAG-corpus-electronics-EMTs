When  designing  frequency  synthesizers  using  PLLs,  care  must  be  taken  to  prevent  noise  from  the  PLL
components from introducing excessive noise. The divider ratio (
) used in the feedback of the loop has the
effect of multiplying any noise that appears at the input or output of the phase detector by this factor. Frequently,
 is required to achieve the desired output frequencies. This can cause excessive output noise.
a large value of 
All these effects must be taken into account to achieve a PLL design with optimum noise performance.
