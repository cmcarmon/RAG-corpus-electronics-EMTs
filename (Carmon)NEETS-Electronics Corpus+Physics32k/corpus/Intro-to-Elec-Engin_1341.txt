(14.3.6)
where k is the Boltzmann constant given by 1.381 × 10
−23 J/K and T is the source temperature
∼= 290 K
in kelvins. Equation (14.3.6) suggests that a hot resistance is noisier than a cool one, which is
compatible with our notion of thermally agitated electrons. At room temperature T0
(17° C), η0 works out as 4 × 10
