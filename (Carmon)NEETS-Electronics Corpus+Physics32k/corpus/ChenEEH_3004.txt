A cross section of the patch antenna is shown in Figure
11.15. In this model, it is assumed that the patch antenna
consists of a perfect magnetic conductor (PMC) walls on the
sides of the patch antenna, giving rise to standing wave type
modes inside the patch antenna cavity. The total length of the
cavity is the length of the patch antenna (dimension b) and an
effective length at each edge due to the microstrip open-end
effect. The fundamental resonance of the cavity formed by the
microstrip patch antenna will occur at the frequency where the
