You can throw with the same grip as Tsushima Fast Ball and Tsushima Fast Ball. Depending on the pitcher, grasp the thumb as shown in the picture below.
Twisting the wrist/forearm extremely inward in the direction of inward rotation releases it, which places a heavy burden on the elbow, which easily leads to injury. Kudo told me that he was naturally inwardly swung from the state where his forearm was outwardly rotated, releasing it with a feeling of pushing the ball with the middle finger would not strain the elbow, Hiramatsu did not put his fingers on the seams, For a moment the opening of the left shoulder was made earlier. In the baseball world, it is widely said that "Good pitchers of the curve slider have poor shots, good pitching pitchers have poor curves". This is thought to be due to the difference in hand shape and the difference in pitching form. Aoyama Noboru says, "In Japan 's history of baseball, both curves and shoots were top notches is about Takehiko Bessho."
