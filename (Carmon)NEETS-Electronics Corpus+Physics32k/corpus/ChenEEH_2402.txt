frequency. In this case, the antenna impedance looks like a
parallel RLC resonant circuit. The frequency, fr , for which the
impedance magnitude is maximum, or equivalently the react-
ance is zero, is often deﬁned as the resonant frequency. It is
desirable to operate the antenna at this resonant frequency so
that it can be easily matched to an input transmission line with
a real characteristic impedance. The frequency span Dfr ,
beyond which the impedance magnitude falls below half
of the resonant value, may be deﬁned as the impedance band-
width of the antenna. The antenna may be usable in this
frequency band. Outside the antenna’s bandwidth, the input
power to the antenna would be signiﬁcantly reﬂected due to
impedance mismatch, resulting in poor radiation.
