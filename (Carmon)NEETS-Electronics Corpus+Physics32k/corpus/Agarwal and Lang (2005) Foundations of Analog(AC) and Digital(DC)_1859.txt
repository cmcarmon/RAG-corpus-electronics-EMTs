The next task, then, is to find an easy way of calculating the real part of a
complex expression. (Those readers who are a little hazy about manipulation
of complex numbers, and in particular the conversion between rectangular and
polar form, should review at this point Appendix C on complex numbers or a
suitable math text.) In this specific problem, we must find the real part of the
˜vcp expression, Equation 13.17. The difficulty is that the expression has two
factors, one in Cartesian or rectangular form, and the other in polar, whereas
multiplication is simpler if both factors are in polar form. Hence we rewrite
Equation 13.17 in polar form as
(cid:1)
˜vcp =
