Plastic electrical tape has come into wide use in recent years. It has certain advantages over rubber 
and friction tape. For example, it can withstand higher voltages for a given thickness. Single thin layers of 
certain plastic tape will withstand several thousand volts without breaking down. However, to provide an 
extra margin of safety, several layers are usually wound over the splice. The extra layers of thin tape add 
very little bulk. The additional layers of plastic tape provide the added protection normally furnished by 
friction tape.
