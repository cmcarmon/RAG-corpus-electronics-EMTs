Figure 3-5(B) is a picture of the switch. This switch is called a pushbutton switch because it has a
button that must be pushed to change the switch contact connections. Notice that the switch has four
terminals. The schematic symbol in figure 3-5(A) shows that when one set of contacts is open, the other
set of contacts is closed. This switch is a double-pole, single-throw, double-break switch.
