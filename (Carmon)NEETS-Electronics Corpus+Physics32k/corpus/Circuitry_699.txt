Fault finding is a disciplined and logical process in 
which  ‘trial  fixing’ should  never be contemplated. 
The  generalized  process  of 
is 
illustrated  in  the  flowchart  of  Fig.  15.1.  First  you 
need  to  verify  that  the  equipment  really  is  faulty 
and that you haven’t overlooked something obvious 
(such as a defective battery or disconnected signal 
cable). This may sound rather obvious but in some 
cases  a  fault  may  simply  be  attributable 
to 
maladjustment  or  misconnection.  Furthermore, 
where  several  items  of  equipment  are  connected 
together, it  may  not be easy to pinpoint the single 
item of faulty equipment.  
  The second stage is that of gathering all relevant 
information. This process involves asking questions 
such as: 
 
(cid:127) In what circumstances did the circuit fail? 
(cid:127) Has  the  circuit  operated  correctly  before  and
