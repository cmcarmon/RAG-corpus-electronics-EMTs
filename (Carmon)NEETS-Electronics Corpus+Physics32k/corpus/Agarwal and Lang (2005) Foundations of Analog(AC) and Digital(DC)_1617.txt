We will derive the average total power consumed by the inverter as in the
example in Section 11.2. Let us denote the high part of the input signal as T1
and the low part of the signal as T2. Similarly, let w1 be the energy dissipated
during the interval T1 and w2 the energy dissipated during the interval T2. Then
the average power dissipated in the circuit is given by
