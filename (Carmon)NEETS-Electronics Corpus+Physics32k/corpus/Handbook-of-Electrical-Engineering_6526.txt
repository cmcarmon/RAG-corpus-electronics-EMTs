External Modulation
Laser-diode-pumped YAG lasers with low RIN and output powers greater than 200 mW have been developed
recently. Combined with linearized external LiNbO3 modulators, these lasers have become high-performance
competitors to directly modulated lasers. YAG lasers with external modulation offer a considerable increase in
launched  power,  and  the  low  RIN  of  the  YAG  laser  translates  into  a  slight  CNR  improvement.  The  most
challenging technical hurdle is to develop a linear low-loss optical intensity modulator.
