Now look at figure 3-3(B). The switch is shown with its schematic symbol. The schematic symbol
has two points at which current can enter the switch, so this is a double-pole switch. Each of the poles is
mechanically connected (still electrically separate) to one point, so this is a single-throw switch. Only one
throw is required to route two separate circuit paths through the switch.
