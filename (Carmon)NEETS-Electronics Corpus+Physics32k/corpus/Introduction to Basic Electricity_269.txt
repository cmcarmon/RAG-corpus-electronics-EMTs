Reverse	engineering	rode	along	with	the	popularity	of	CAD	or	Computer-Aided
Design.	Through	the	years,	the	field	that	used	to	be	limited	to	the	basic
improvement	of	a	circuit’s	system	began	incorporating	complex	features.	It
provides	a	circuit	creator	the	chance	to	analyze	the	internal	portion	of	a	device.
Moreover,	instead	of	settling	on	getting	a	fundamental	view	of	a	circuit	project	that
requires	reverse	engineering,	a	circuit	creator	can	meticulously	analyze	a	circuit;
he	can	inspect	each	component	thoroughly	and	come	up	at	the	most	practical
solution.	For	its	development,	circuit	engineers,	circuit	designers,	and	other
professionals	on	electronics	started	collaborative	works	with	architects	and	those
who	are	skilled	in	CAD.
Advantages	of	using	CAD	technology	for	a	circuit	project:
To	improve	the	alignment	of	each	circuit	component
To	enhance	the	designation	of	spaces	within	a	circuit’s	system
To	modify	geometric	subjects	for	boosted	performance
To	zoom	in	(and	look	closely)	on	each	circuit	component
