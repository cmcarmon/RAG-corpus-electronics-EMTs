A requirement for this to be a measurement system is to have a set of variable resistors
available whose resistances are precisely known, to serve as reference standards. For example,
if we connect a bridge circuit to measure an unknown resistance Rx, we will have to know the
exact values of the other three resistors at balance to determine the value of Rx:
