The simplest type of tone control is illustrated in figure 2-22. Fixed capacitor C1 parallels the
primary winding of the output transformer, effectively shunting the higher frequencies to ground. The size
of C1 determines the lowest frequency to be affected. When you select the BASS position of the tone
control, C1 is connected and improves bass response by de-emphasizing the treble tones. You can often
use this circuit to improve the output of a small speaker with poor treble response.
