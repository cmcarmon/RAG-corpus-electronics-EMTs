Fiber mismatches are a source of intrinsic coupling loss. As stated before, intrinsic coupling loss
results from differences (mismatches) in the inherent fiber characteristics of the two connecting fibers.
Fiber mismatches occur when manufacturers fail to maintain optical or structural (geometrical) tolerances
during fiber fabrication.
