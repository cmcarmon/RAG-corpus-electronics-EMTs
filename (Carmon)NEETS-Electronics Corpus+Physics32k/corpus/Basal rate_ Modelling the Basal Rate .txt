Most adult diabetics (over the age of 21) will have a fairly constant ratio of bolus:basal of 60%:40%, where 60% of all insulin intake in a single 24-hour period will be attributed to meals (bolus) and 40% should then be attributed to the basal rate. This ratio will fluctuate from person to person depending on their size, activity level, and caloric intake as well but is a good baseline for determining the correct basal rate for an adult diabetic. Thus, the basal rate could theoretically be set based on an averaged bolus insulin intake of several days. Averaging the total bolus, and then dividing this number by 36 would then give the required hourly basal rate intake for any individual with a 60:40 ratio established.
