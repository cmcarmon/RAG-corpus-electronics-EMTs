A  major  advantage  of  magnetic  stimulation  is  that  no  electrodes  are  required  and  the  skin  need  not  be
exposed  to  apply  the  stimuli.  However,  the  main  advantage  is  that  the  skin  sensation  is  very  mild. A  major
disadvantage is the high energy needed to induce sufﬁcient eddy current density to achieve stimulation. When
repetitive  pulses  are  required,  the  power  drawn  by  the  magnetic  stimulator  may  require  a  60-Hz AC  energy
source of 220 or 440 volts. Moreover, with repetitive stimulation, coil heating becomes a problem. The avail-
ability of magnetically permeable materials that saturate at several orders of magnitude above presently available
materials would be of beneﬁt to the ﬁeld of magnetic (eddy-current) stimulation.
