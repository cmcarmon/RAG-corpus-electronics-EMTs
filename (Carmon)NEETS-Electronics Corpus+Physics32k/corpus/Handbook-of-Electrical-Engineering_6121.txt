However, voltage collapse can also be due to longer term problems. Transient stability programs then need
to  take  into  account  controls  that  are  usually  ignored.  These  include  automatic  transformer  tap  adjustment
and generator excitation limiters which control the long-term reactive power output to keep the Ô¨Åeld currents
within their rated values.
