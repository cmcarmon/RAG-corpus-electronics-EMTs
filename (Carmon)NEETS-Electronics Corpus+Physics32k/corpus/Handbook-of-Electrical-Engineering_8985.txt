Joystick: An input device somewhat in the form of the navigation control device found in early aircraft and
operating  in  a  somewhat  similar  manner  by  generating  series  of  pulses  whose  frequency  or  number
depend on how far, with what force, and in what direction the control stick is moved from the central
position.
