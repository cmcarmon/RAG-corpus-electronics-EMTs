Let's look at the series-positive limiter and its outputs in figure 4-1. Diode D1 is in series with the 
output and the output is taken across resistor R1. The input must be negative with respect to the anode of 
the diode to make the diode conduct. When the positive alternation of the input signal (T0 to T1) is 
applied to the circuit, the cathode is positive with respect to the anode. The diode is reverse biased and 
will not conduct. Since no current can flow, no output is developed across the resistor during the positive 
alternation of the input signal.
