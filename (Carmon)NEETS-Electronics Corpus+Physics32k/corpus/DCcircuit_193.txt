If connecting wire resistance is very little or none, we can regard the connected points in
a circuit as being electrically common. That is, points 1 and 2 in the above circuits may be
physically joined close together or far apart, and it doesn’t matter for any voltage or resistance
measurements relative to those points. The same goes for points 3 and 4. It is as if the ends
of the resistor were attached directly across the terminals of the battery, so far as our Ohm’s
Law calculations and voltage measurements are concerned. This is useful to know, because it
means you can re-draw a circuit diagram or re-wire a circuit, shortening or lengthening the
wires as desired without appreciably impacting the circuit’s function. All that matters is that
the components attach to each other in the same sequence.
