A number of textbooks are available that cover the broad area of image processing and several that focus on
more specialized topics within this ﬁeld. The texts by Gonzalez and Wintz [1991], Jain [1989], Pratt [1991],
and Rosenfeld and Kak (Vol. 1) [1982] are quite broad in their scope. Gonzalez and Wintz’s treatment is written
at a somewhat lower level than that of the other texts. For a more detailed treatment of computed tomography
and other medical imaging modalities, the reader may consult the texts by Herman [1979], Macovski [1983],
and Kak and Slaney [1988]. To explore the ﬁeld of computer vision, the reader is advised to consult the text
by Ballard and Brown [1982]. Current research and applications of image processing are reported in a number
of journals. Of particular note are the IEEE Transactions on Image Processing; the IEEE Transactions on Pattern
Analysis and Machine Intelligence; the IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing; the IEEE Transactions
on Medical Imaging; the Journal of the Optical Society of America, A: Optical Engineering; the Journal of Electronic
Imaging; and Computer Vision, Graphics, and Image Processing.
