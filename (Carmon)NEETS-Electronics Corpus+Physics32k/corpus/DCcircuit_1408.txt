oppose changes in current, and act precisely the opposite of capacitors, which oppose changes
in voltage. A fully discharged inductor (no magnetic ﬁeld), having zero current through it, will
initially act as an open-circuit when attached to a source of voltage (as it tries to maintain
zero current), dropping maximum voltage across its leads. Over time, the inductor’s current
rises to the maximum value allowed by the circuit, and the terminal voltage decreases cor-
respondingly. Once the inductor’s terminal voltage has decreased to a minimum (zero for a
”perfect” inductor), the current will stay at a maximum level, and it will behave essentially as
a short-circuit.
