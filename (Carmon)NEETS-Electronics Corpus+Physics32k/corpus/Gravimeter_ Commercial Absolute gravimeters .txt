Gravimeters for measuring the earth's gravity as precisely as possible, are getting smaller and more portable. A common type measures the acceleration of small masses free falling in a vacuum, when the accelerometer is firmly attached to the ground. The mass includes a retroreflector and terminates one arm of a Michelson interferometer. By counting and timing the interference fringes, the acceleration of the mass can be measured. A more recent development is a "rise and fall" version that tosses the mass upward and measures both upward and downward motion. This allows cancellation of some measurement errors, however "rise and fall" gravimeters are not in common use. Absolute gravimeters are used in the calibration of relative gravimeters, surveying for gravity anomalies (voids), and for establishing the vertical control network.
Atom interferometric and atomic fountain methods are used for precise measurement of the earth's gravity. And atomic clocks and purpose-built instruments can use time dilation (also called general relativistic) measurements to track changes in the gravitational potential and gravitational accelation on the earth.
The term "absolute" does not convey the instrument's stability, sensitivity, accuracy, ease of use, and bandwidth. So it and "relative" should not be used when more specific characteristics can be given.
