your circuit — and get both a fixed and vari­
able resistor for the price of one!
Rheostats  typically  handle  higher  levels  of 
voltage  and  current  than  potentiometers. 
This makes them ideal for industrial applica­
tions, such as controlling the speed of electric 
motors in large machines. However, rheostats 
have largely been replaced by circuits that use 
semiconductor devices (see Chapter 9), which 
consume much less power.
The circuit symbol used to represent a rheostat 
is shown in Figure 5­8, right.
