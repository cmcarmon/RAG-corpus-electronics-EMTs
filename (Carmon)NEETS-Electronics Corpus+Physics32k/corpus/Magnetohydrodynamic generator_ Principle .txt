The Lorentz Force Law describes the effects of a charged particle moving in a constant magnetic field. The simplest form of this law is given by the vector equation.





F

=
Q
⋅
(

v

×

B

)


{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =Q\cdot (\mathbf {v} \times \mathbf {B} )}


where
F is the force acting on the particle.
Q is the charge of the particle,
v is the velocity of the particle, and
B is the magnetic field.
The vector F is perpendicular to both v and B according to the right hand rule.
