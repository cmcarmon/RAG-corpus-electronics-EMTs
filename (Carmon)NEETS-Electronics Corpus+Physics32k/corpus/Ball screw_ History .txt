The ball screw was invented by Rudolph G. Boehm of Sugar Land, Texas. He was granted in 1929 US Patent 1,704,031 titled "Antifriction nut".
Early precise screwshafts were produced by starting with a low precision screwshaft, and then lapping the shaft with several spring-loaded nut laps. By rearranging and inverting the nut laps, the lengthwise errors of the nuts and shaft were averaged. Then, the very repeatable shaft's pitch is measured against a distance standard. A similar process is sometimes used today to produce reference standard screw shafts, or master manufacturing screw shafts.
A ball screw is used to expand the Deployable Tower Assembly (DTA) structure on the James Webb Space Telescope
