A noisy input signal to a logic gate could cause unwanted state changes near the voltage
threshold. Schmitt trigger logic reduces this problem by using two voltage thresholds: a high
threshold to switch the circuit during low-to-high transitions and a lower threshold to switch
the circuit during high-to-low transitions. Such a trigger scheme is immune to noise as long
as the peak-to-peak amplitude of the noise is less than the diï¬€erence between the threshold
voltages. A gate with the Schmitt trigger feature has a small hysteresis curve drawn inside
the gate symbol. Schmitt triggers are mostly used in inverters or simple gates to condition
slow or noisy signals before passing them to more critical parts of the logic circuit.
