HIGH-LEVEL LANGUAGESâ€”Programming languages that allow the programmer to write programs
in English-like terms and symbols and mathematical notation, rather than the 0's and 1's used by the
computer. These high-level programs must be translated into machine language before the computer
can execute them. FORTRAN, Ada, COBOL, and BASIC are examples.
