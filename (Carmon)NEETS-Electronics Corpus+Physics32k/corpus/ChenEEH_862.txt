In the former case, Figure 4.5(A), the edge direction labeling
is preserved while the permissible range for the new single
edge is chosen such that the permissible ranges of the multiple
paths from Rx to Ry are simultaneously satisﬁed. As shown in
Figure 4.5(A), the new permissible range [lz, uz] is the inter-
section of the multiple permissible ranges [lz0 , uz0 ] through
[lz(n) , uz (n) ] between Rx and Ry. In other words, the new lower
bound is
{lz(i) } and the new upper bound is
uz ¼ min
