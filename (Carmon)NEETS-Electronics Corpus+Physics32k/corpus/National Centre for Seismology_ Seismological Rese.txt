NCS is actively involved in seismological research related to estimating shallow and deep crustal structures in various tectonic domains of the India land mass. This research provides insight into earthquake occurrence processes in the Himalayas, the Burma plate, and the Sumatra trench, as well as crustal deformation measurements in the plate-boundary and plate-interior regions.
