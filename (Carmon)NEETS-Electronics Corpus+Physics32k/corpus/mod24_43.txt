A fiber optic data link consists of three partsâ€”transmitter, optical fiber, and receiver. Figure 1-1
is an illustration of a fiber optic data-link connection. The transmitter, optical fiber, and receiver perform
the basic functions of the fiber optic data link. Each part of the data link is responsible for the successful
transfer of the data signal. A fiber optic data link needs a transmitter that can effectively convert an
electrical input signal to an optical signal and launch the data-containing light down the optical fiber. A
fiber optic data link also needs a receiver that can effectively transform this optical signal back into its
original form. This means that the electrical signal provided as data output should exactly match the
electrical signal provided as data input.
