cerns to protect against as well. Batteries have been known to internally short-circuit, due
to electrode separator failure, causing a problem not unlike that where batteries of unequal
voltage are connected in parallel: the good batteries will overpower the failed (lower voltage)
battery, causing relatively large currents within the batteriesâ€™ connecting wires. To guard
against this eventuality, we should protect each and every battery against overcurrent with
individual battery fuses, in addition to the load fuse:
