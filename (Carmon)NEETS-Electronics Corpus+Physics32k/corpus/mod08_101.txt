It has been mentioned that efficiency and impedance are important in amplifiers. The reasons for this 
may not be too clear. You have been shown that any amplifier is a current-control device. Now there are 
two other principles you should try to keep in mind. First, there is no such thing as "something for 
nothing" in electronics. That means every time you do something to a signal it costs something. It might 
mean a loss in fidelity to get high power. Some other compromise might also be made when a circuit is 
designed. Regardless of the compromise, every stage will require and use power. This brings up the 
second principle-do things as efficiently as possible. The improvement and design of electronic circuits is 
an attempt to do things as cheaply as possible, in terms of power, when all the other requirements 
(fidelity, power output, frequency range, etc.) have been met.
