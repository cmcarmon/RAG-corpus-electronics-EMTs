Since the atmosphere is bombarded by ultraviolet light waves of different frequencies, several 
ionized layers are formed at different altitudes. Lower frequency ultraviolet waves penetrate the 
atmosphere the least; therefore, they produce ionized layers at the higher altitudes. Conversely, ultraviolet 
waves of higher frequencies penetrate deeper and produce layers at the lower altitudes.
