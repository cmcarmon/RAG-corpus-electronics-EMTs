Any discussion of soldering techniques should include an explanation of solder itself. Ordinary soft 
solder is a fusible alloy consisting chiefly of tin and lead. It is used to join two or more metals at 
temperatures below their melting point. In addition to tin and lead, soft solders occasionally contain 
varying amounts of antimony, bismuth, cadmium, or silver. These are added to change the melting point 
or physical properties of the alloy. Ordinary table salt has to be heated to 1,488ยบ F before it melts. 
However, when a little water is added, it dissolves easily at room temperature. The action of molten 
solder on a metal like copper may be compared to the action of water on salt.
