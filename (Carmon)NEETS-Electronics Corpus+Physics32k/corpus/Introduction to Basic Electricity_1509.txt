lithium	cells (Figure 12-15) have overcome the 
inherent properties associated with lithium. Lithium 
is extremely reactive with water. Lithium cell forma-
tion uses lithium, manganese dioxide (MnO2), and a 
lithium perchlorate (LiCIO4) in an organic solvent 
(water cannot be used). The output of a lithium cell 
is approximately 3 volts. Lithium cells are very effi-
cient, with energy densities of about 90 watt-hours per 
pound. The greatest benefit of lithium cells is their ex-
tremely long shelf life of 5 to 10 years.
