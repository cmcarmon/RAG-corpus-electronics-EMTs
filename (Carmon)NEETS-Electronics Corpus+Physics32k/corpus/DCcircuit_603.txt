This simpliﬁed layout greatly eases the task of determining where to start and how to
proceed in reducing the circuit down to a single equivalent (total) resistance. Notice how the
circuit has been re-drawn, all we have to do is start from the right-hand side and work our way
left, reducing simple-series and simple-parallel resistor combinations one group at a time until
we’re done.
