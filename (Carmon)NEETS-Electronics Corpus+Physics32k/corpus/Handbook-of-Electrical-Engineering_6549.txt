The zero dispersion wavelength, close to 1300 nm for silica ﬁbers, makes this wavelength attractive for high-
capacity links. The dispersion at 1550 nm is typically close to 20 ps/(nm · km). This is a moderate amount of
dispersion. If a proposed 1550-nm system is bandwidth limited because of this spread, several alternatives are
available. One solution is to use dispersion-shifted ﬁber, which is a special ﬁber with a refractive index proﬁle
designed to shift the zero dispersion wavelength from 1300 nm to 1550 nm. Another solution is to transmit
soliton pulses, which use the nonlinearity of the ﬁber to maintain pulse shape during transmission.
