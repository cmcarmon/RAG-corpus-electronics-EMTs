In MATLAB, the user interface is deceptively simple. One can take a short tutorial and learn the basic concepts
and underlying principles in perhaps one hour. But what happens when one is ﬁnished with the tutorial and
wants to do some actual work? The sheer number of commands in the system can be overwhelming. In basic
MATLAB there are some two hundred commands, add a few toolboxes and the number quickly increases. The
only way to ﬁnd out how to use a command is to know its name. If you don’t know the name you can list all
the commands available, but since each command name is limited to eight characters, there is not necessarily
going to be any relationship between command name and command function. Having found a command the
next step is to learn how to use it. In a research prototype CACSD package called IMPACT, Rimvall and Bomholt
[1985] provided a latent question and answer mode feature which switches from normal command entry to
step  by  step  elicitation  of  parameters  when  requested  by  the  user.  Other  ways  of  overcoming  some  of  these
difﬁculties [Rimvall, 1988] include providing a means of loading toolboxes only when they are needed, thereby
reducing the instantaneous “name-space”, and providing operator overloading so that the same named proce-
dure in X-Math [Floyd et al., 1991] and enables, for example, the multiplication operator ‘*’ to mean matrix
multiplication, series combination of systems, polynomial convolution, or time response evaluation depending
on the types of the operands.
