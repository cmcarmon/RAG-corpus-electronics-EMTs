The ESS source will be built around a solid tungsten target, cooled by helium gas.
Radioactive substances will be generated by the spallation process, but the solid target makes the handling of these materials easier and safer than if a liquid target had been used.
ESS, E.on, and Lunds Energi are collaborating in a project aiming to get the facility to be the world's first completely sustainable large-scale research centre through investment in wind power. The ESS project is expected to include an extension of the Nysted Wind Farm.
Radioactive material storage and transport will be required, but the need is much less than that of a nuclear reactor.

ESS expects to be CO2-neutral.
Recent design improvements will decrease energy usage at ESS.
