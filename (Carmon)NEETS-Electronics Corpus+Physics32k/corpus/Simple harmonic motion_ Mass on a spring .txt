A mass m attached to a spring of spring constant k exhibits simple harmonic motion in closed space. The equation for describing the period

m

{\displaystyle T=2\pi {\sqrt {\frac {m}{k}}}}

shows the period of oscillation is independent of both the amplitude and gravitational acceleration. The above equation is also valid in the case when an additional constant force is being applied on the mass, i.e. the additional constant force cannot change the period of oscillation.
