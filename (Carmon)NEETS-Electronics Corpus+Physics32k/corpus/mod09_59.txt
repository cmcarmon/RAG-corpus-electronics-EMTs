For every combination of L and C, there is only ONE frequency (in both series and parallel circuits) 
that causes XL to exactly equal XC; this frequency is known as the RESONANT FREQUENCY. When 
the resonant frequency is fed to a series or parallel circuit, X L becomes equal to XC, and the circuit is said 
to be RESONANT to that frequency. The circuit is now called a RESONANT CIRCUIT; resonant 
circuits are tuned circuits. The circuit condition wherein XL becomes equal to XC is known as 
RESONANCE.
