Rf power amplifiers require that a specific amount of power be fed into the grid circuit. Only in this 
way can the tube deliver an amplified power output. However, the stable oscillator can produce only 
limited amounts of power. Therefore, the mopa transmitter is limited in the amount of power it can 
develop. This is one of the disadvantages of the mopa transmitter. Another disadvantage is that it often is 
impractical for use at very- and ultra-high frequencies. The reason is that the stability of self-excited 
oscillators decreases rapidly as the operating frequency increases. Circuit tuning capacitances are small at 
high frequencies and stray capacitances adversely affect frequency stability.
