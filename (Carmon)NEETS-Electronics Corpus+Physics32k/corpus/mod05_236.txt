Two phase implies two voltages if we apply our new definition of phase. And, itâ€™s that simple. A
two-phase alternator is designed to produce two completely separate voltages. Each voltage, by itself,
may be considered as a single-phase voltage. Each is generated completely independent of the other.
Certain advantages are gained. These and the mechanics of generation will be covered in the following
paragraphs.
