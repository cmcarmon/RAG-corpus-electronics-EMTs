The horizontal and vertical POSITION controls (figure 6-16) are used to position the trace. Because
the graticule is often drawn to represent a graph, some oscilloscopes have the positioning controls labeled
to correspond to the X and Y axes of the graph. The X axis represents horizontal movement; the Y axis
represents the vertical movement. Figure 6-18 shows the effects of positioning controls on the trace.
