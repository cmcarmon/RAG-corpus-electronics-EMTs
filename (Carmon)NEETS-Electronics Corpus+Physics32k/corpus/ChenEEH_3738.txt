The procedure by which a test word is assigned an optimal
match score with respect to a reference string is straightfor-
ward. Both the test and reference utterances are reduced to
strings of features extracted from the acoustic speech wave-
form. Let us denote the test utterance feature vectors by {ti}I
i¼1
and those of the reference utterance by {rj}J
j¼1, where i and j
index the frames as we progress in time. The test and reference
features are (conceptually, at least) laid out on the abscissa and
ordinate of a grid much like that discussed previously in
Section 3.3.4. Although the indices i and j denumerate frame
numbers rather than absolute sample times, it is customary to
refer to the i and j axes as ‘‘time’’ axes. Costs are assigned to
