Figure 7.4.2 shows the n-channel JFET and the p-channel JFET along with their circuit
symbols. The JFET, which is a three-terminal device, consists of a single junction embedded in a
semiconductor sample. When the base semiconductor forming the channel is of a n-type material,
the device is known as an n-channel JFET; otherwise it is a p-channel JFET when the channel is
