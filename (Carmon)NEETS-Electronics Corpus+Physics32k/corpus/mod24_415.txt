Light-duty connectors and heavy-duty connectors are two ways that the Navy classifies fiber optic
connectors. Light-duty connector shipboard applications include locations that protect the connectors
from the environment, such as in a junction box or equipment enclosure. Heavy-duty applications require
a very rugged, stand-alone, sealed connector. A heavy-duty connector must also withstand pulls and tugs
on the fiber cable without disrupting system operation. Light-duty connectors can be of the ferrule,
biconical, or expanded-beam designs. Ferrule-type STÂ® connectors are becoming the commercial
connector of choice for local area network (LAN) and data transfer links and are the standard connector
for Navy light duty applications. This connector is described in specification sheets 16, 17, and 18 of
MIL-C-83522. Figure 4-21 shows the ST type of light-duty connector.
