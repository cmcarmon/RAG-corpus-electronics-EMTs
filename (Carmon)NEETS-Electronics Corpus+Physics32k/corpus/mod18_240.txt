As you can see in the figure, the modulator pulse is applied to the transmitter the instant the
modulator receives the trigger pulse from the synchronizer (T1, T2). The modulator pulse is flat on top
and has very steep leading and trailing edges. These pulse characteristics are necessary for the proper
operation of the transmitter and for the accurate determination of target range. The range timing circuits
must be triggered the instant the leading edge of the transmitted rf pulse leaves the transmitter. In this
way, the trigger pulse that controls the operation of the modulator also synchronizes the cathode-ray tube
sweep circuits and range measuring circuits.
