The input signal applied to the primary tank circuit is shown as vector ep. Since coupling capacitor
C8 has negligible reactance at the input frequency, rf choke L3 is effectively in parallel with the primary
tank circuit. Also, because L3 is effectively in parallel with the primary tank circuit, input voltage ep also
appears across L3. With voltage ep applied to the primary of T1, a voltage is induced in the secondary
which causes current to flow in the secondary tank circuit. When the input frequency is equal to the center
frequency, the tank is at resonance and acts resistive. Current and voltage are in phase in a resistance
circuit, as shown by is and ep. The current flowing in the tank causes voltage drops across each half of the
balanced secondary winding of transformer T1. These voltage drops are of equal amplitude and opposite
