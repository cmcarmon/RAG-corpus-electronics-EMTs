With Ea being a trapezoidal voltage, as shown in figure 3-49, view (C), the instant current flows, a 
voltage appears across the resistor, and the applied voltage increases. With an increasing applied voltage, 
the inductor voltage remains constant (EL) at the jump level and circuit current (I R) rises at a linear rate 
from the jump voltage point. Notice that if you add the inductor voltage (EL) and resistor voltage (ER) at 
any point between times T0 and T1, the sum is the applied voltage (Ea). The key fact here is that a 
trapezoidal voltage must be applied to a sweep coil to cause a linear rise of current. The linear rise of 
current will cause a uniform, changing magnetic field which, in turn, will cause an electron beam to move 
at a constant rate across a crt.
