The other types of clay that were famous in antiquity were as follows.
Terra chia, Terra cymolia (Cimolean earth): these were both white earths and considered of great value.
Samian earth: Pliny in c. 50 AD (Nat. Hist.) details two distinct varieties, colyrium - an eye salve, and aster, which was used as a soap as well as in medicines.
Terra sigillata strigoniensis (Strigian earth, derived from Silesia) - this clay, yellow in colour, appears to have been famous later in medieval times.
All the above seem to have been bentonitic clays.
The earth which did not stain the hands was known as rubrica.
