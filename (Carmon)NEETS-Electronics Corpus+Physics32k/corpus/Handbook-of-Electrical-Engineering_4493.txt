The continuing growth of computing resources is changing how we think about, formulate, solve, and interpret
problems. In electromagnetics as elsewhere, computational techniques are complementing the more traditional
approaches of measurement and analysis to vastly broaden the breadth and depth of problems that are now
quantiﬁable. Computational electromagnetics (CEM) may be broadly deﬁned as that branch of electromagnetics
that intrinsically and routinely involves using a digital computer to obtain numerical results. With the evolu-
tionary development of CEM during the past 20-plus years, the third tool of computational methods has been
added to the two classical tools of experimental observation and mathematical analysis.
