Let us now build logic gates using MOSFETs. Consider the circuit shown in
Figure 6.14, which comprises a MOSFET and a load resistor powered by a
supply voltage VS. The input to the circuit is connected to the gate of the
MOSFET, the source is tied to ground, and drain is tied to VS in series with a
load resister RL. The same circuit is redrawn on the right-hand side using the
shorthand notation for the power and ground terminals.
