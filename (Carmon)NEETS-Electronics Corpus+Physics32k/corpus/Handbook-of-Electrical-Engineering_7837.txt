1Coercivity of a magnetic medium is a measure of its resistance to magnetization reversal. For example, consider a thin
ﬁlm with perpendicular magnetic moment saturated in the +Z direction. A magnetic ﬁeld applied along –Z will succeed in
reversing the direction of magnetization only if the ﬁeld is stronger than the coercivity of the ﬁlm.
