I = 1+2R2 cos[ω(λAr+λrB)]+R^4
Where: Intensity is related to the magnitude of the reflection coefficient (R) and the phase component ω(λAr+λrB). An estimate of the reflectivity distributions can be obtained through the crosscorrelation of the direct wave at a location A with the reflection recorded at a location B where A represents the reference trace. The multiplication of the conjugate of the trace spectrum at A and the trace spectrum at B gives:
