Figure  83.19  describes  the  unipotential  lens  focus  structure,  also  called  an  EINZEL  lens  design.  Another
structure, widely used in modern CRTs, is the bipotential lens focus structure represented in Fig. 83.20. The
bipotential structure is theoretically a better performer than the unipotential focus structure, because the lenses
have less curvature of the line forces and less spherical aberration.
