The shell theorem is an immediate consequence of Gauss's law for gravity saying that

{\displaystyle \int _{S}{\mathbf {g} }\cdot \,d{\mathbf {S} }=-4\pi GM}

where M is the mass of the part of the spherically symmetric mass distribution that is inside the sphere with radius r and

{\displaystyle \int _{S}{\mathbf {g} }\cdot \,d{\mathbf {S} }=\int _{S}{\mathbf {g} }\cdot {\mathbf {\hat {n}} }\,dS}

is the surface integral of the gravitational field g over any closed surface inside which the total mass is M, the unit vector

being the outward normal to the surface
The gravitational field of a spherically symmetric mass distribution like a mass point, a spherical shell or a homogenous sphere must also be spherically symmetric. If






n

{\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {n}} }
is a unit vector in the direction from the point of symmetry to another point the gravitational field at this other point must therefore be

{\displaystyle \mathbf {g} =g(r)\mathbf {\hat {n}} }

where g(r) only depends on the distance r to the point of symmetry
Selecting the closed surface as a sphere with radius r with center at the point of symmetry the outward normal to a point on the surface,






n

{\displaystyle \mathbf {\hat {n}} }
, is precisely the direction pointing away from the point of symmetry of the mass distribution.
One therefore has that

{\displaystyle \int _{S}\mathbf {g} \cdot \,d{\mathbf {S} }=g(r)\int _{S}\,d{S}=g(r)4\pi r^{2}}
