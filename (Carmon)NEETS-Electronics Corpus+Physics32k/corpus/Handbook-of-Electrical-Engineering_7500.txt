LCD  projection  televisions,  such  as  this “Television  of  the  Future”  could  replace  the  CRT-based  television  if
certain performance criteria are obtained. One criteria being addressed is the need for a very bright, optically
efﬁcient point source for projecting an image through a small LCD. If new lighting technologies are developed,
such as an illumination source that can provide a brighter image with better colors than current CRT technology,
then the consumer television market will certainly change. (Photo courtesy of Thomson Multimedia.)
