Depending on the model, the transmitter tunes across the frequency range in 100- or 500-hertz 
increments. Digital circuitry is used to accomplish this process. Transmitter outputs are also applied to the 
rf amplifier to automatically tune it to the correct frequency. We will go through a detailed breakdown of 
the transmitter unit later in this chapter.
