The block diagram of Figure 16.3.3 is a functional representation of a type of digital control
system, in which G and H serve the same function as in any feedback system. Note that the
error signal is sampled and a digital processor is used. The controller in this system is the digital
processor whose output, reconverted to an analog signal, becomes the excitation for the block G.
As usual, G is the subsystem that provides the output to be controlled. A central computer which
controls several functions could be used as a digital processor; or a microprocessor (special-
purpose computer) designed for the particular control function may also be used as a digital
processor. Large, high-speed computers with their speed, memory, and computational ability,
as well as programmability, are utilized for central control in large automated manufacturing
facilities. The control process may be summarized as follows:
