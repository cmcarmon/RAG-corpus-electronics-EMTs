The degree of reaction contributes to the stage efficiency and thus used as a design parameter. Stages having 50% degree of reaction are used where the pressure drop is equally shared by the stator and the rotor for a turbine.

This reduces the tendency of boundary layer separation from the blade surface avoiding large stagnation pressure losses.
If R= ​1⁄2 then from the relation of degree of reaction,|C| α2 = β3 and the velocity triangle (Figure 4.) is symmetric. The stage enthalpy gets equally distributed in the stage (Figure 5.) . In addition the whirl components are also the same at the inlet of rotor and diffuser.
