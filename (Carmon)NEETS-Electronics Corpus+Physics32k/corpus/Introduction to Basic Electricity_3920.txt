Figure 38-7 shows a two-transistor power amplifier 
circuit, called a push–pull amplifier. The top half of 
the circuit is a mirror image of the bottom half. Each 
half is a single transistor amplifier. The output volt-
age is developed across the primary of the transformer 
during alternate half-cycles of the input signal. Both 
transistors are biased either class AB or class B. The 
input to a push–pull amplifier requires complemen-
tary signals. That is, one signal must be inverted com-
pared to the other. However, both signals must have 
the same amplitude and the same frequency. The cir-
cuit that produces the complementary signal is called 
a phase splitter. A single-transistor phase splitter is 
shown in Figure 38-8. The complementary outputs are 
taken from the collector and the emitter of the transis-
tor. The phase splitter is operated as a class A amplifier 
to provide minimum distortion. The coupling capaci-
tors are necessary to offset the differences between the 
DC collector and emitter voltages.
