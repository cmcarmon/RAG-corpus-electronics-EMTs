A single full adder is capable of adding two single-
bit numbers and an input carry. To add binary num-
bers with more than 1 bit, additional full adders must 
be used. Remember, when one binary number is added 
to another, each column that is added generates a sum 
and a carry of 1 or 0 to the next higher-order column. 
To add two binary numbers, a full adder is required 
for each column. For example, to add a 2-bit number 
to another 2-bit number, two adders are required. Two 
3-bit numbers require three adders, two 4-bit numbers 
require four adders, and so on. The carry generated by 
each adder is applied to the input of the next higher-
order adder. Because no carry input is required for the 
least significant position, a half adder is used.
