Where  a  transistor  is  operated  as  a  saturated 
switch, 
junction  potentials  depend  upon 
whether the transistor is in the ‘on’ or ‘off’ state. In 
the ‘off’ condition, the base-emitter voltage will be 
very low (typically 0 V) whereas the collector-base 
voltage  will  be  high  and,  in  many  cases,  almost 
equal  to  the  collector  supply  voltage.  In  the  ‘on’ 
state,  the  base-emitter  voltage  will  be  relatively 
large  (typically  0.7  V)  and  the  collector-base 
voltage will fall to a very low value (typically 0.5 
V).  It  should  be  noted  that,  in  normal  saturated 
switching, the collector-emitter voltage may fall to 
as  low  as  0.2  V  and  thus  the  base-emitter  voltage 
will become reversed in polarity (i.e. base positive 
with  respect  to  collector  in  the  case  of  an  NPN 
transistor). The  junction  potentials  associated  with
