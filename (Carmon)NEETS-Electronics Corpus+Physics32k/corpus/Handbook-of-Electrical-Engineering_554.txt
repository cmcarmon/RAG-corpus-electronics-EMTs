are  in  many  respects  functionally  equivalent  to  biased  diodes.  Figure  5.14  shows  two  operational  ampliÔ¨Åer
clipping circuits using Zener diodes. The Zener diode conducts like a conventional diode when it is forward
biased, so it is necessary to connect a reversed diode in series with it to prevent shorting of Rf. When the reverse
voltage across the Zener diode reaches VZ, the diode breaks down and conducts heavily, while maintaining an
essentially constant voltage, VZ, across it. Under those conditions, the total voltage across  Rf, i.e., vo, equals VZ
plus the forward drop, VD, across the conventional diode.
