To investigate the equivalent circuit of a synchronous machine, for the sake of simplicity, let
us begin by considering an unsaturated cylindrical-rotor synchronous machine. Effects of saliency
and magnetic saturation can be considered later. Since for the present we are only concerned with
the steady-state behavior of the machine, circuit parameters of the ﬁeld and damper windings need
not be considered. The effect of the ﬁeld winding, however, is taken care of by the ﬂux produced
by the dc ﬁeld excitation and the ac voltage generated by the ﬁeld ﬂux in the armature circuit.
