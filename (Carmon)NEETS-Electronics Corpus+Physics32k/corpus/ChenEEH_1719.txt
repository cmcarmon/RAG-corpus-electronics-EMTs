Semantic Modeling and Querying of Video Data
Owing to its distinguished characteristics from textual or
image data—very rich information content, temporal as well
as spatial dimensions, unstructured organization, massive
volume, and complex and ill-deﬁned relationship among
entities—robust video data modeling is an active area of
research. The most important issue that arises in the design
of video database management systems (VDBMSs) is the de-
scription of video data structure in a form that is appropriate
for querying, that is sufﬁciently easy for updating, and that is
compact enough for capturing the rich information content of
the video. The process of designing the high-level abstraction
of raw video facilitates various information retrieval and
manipulation operations is the crux of VDBMSs. To this end,
current semantic-based approaches can be classiﬁed into
segmentation-based and stratiﬁcation-based. The drawback
of the former approaches is lack of ﬂexibility and incapability
of representing semantics residing in overlapping segments.
The latter models, however, segment contextual information
of video instead of simply partitioning it.
