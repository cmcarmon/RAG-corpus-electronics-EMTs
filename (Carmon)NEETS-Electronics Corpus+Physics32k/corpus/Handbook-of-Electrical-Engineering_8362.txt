Figure 85.25 shows a modiﬁed LSSD latch design [Malaiya and Narayanaswamy, 1983] that can be used to
enable  path-delay  testing  as  described  above.  Using  this  design,  it  is  possible  to  load  any  two  arbitrary  test
vectors to the combinational circuit in rapid succession. First, test vector Q1, Q2 ,…,Qn would be scanned into
the L1 latches outputs by using clocks  C3 and C2. Next, the test vector would be moved into the L2 latches by
applying  a  single  C  clock.  This  way  the  ﬂip-ﬂop  outputs  would  be  set  to  their  initial  values  deﬁned  by  Q1,
Q2 ,…,Qn . Following this, the second test vector Y1, Y2,…,Yn would be scanned into the L1 latches using clock
signals  C3 and  C2. Now applying the C clock causes the ﬁrst test vector (Qi) to be replaced by the second test
vector (Yi), and if the  C1 clock is applied next, the response of the combinational circuit will be captured in
the L1 latches. This way, the minimum delay between the clock signals C and C1 that is necessary to allow the
signals to propagate through the combinational circuit can be determined. Other ﬂip-ﬂop designs with built-
in features to support double-strobe testing are also possible [Dervisoglu and Stong, 1991].
