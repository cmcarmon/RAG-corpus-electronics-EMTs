The style of contemporary direct manipulation interface
evolved largely from a prototype developed at the Xerox Palo
Alto Research Center (PARC) in the 1970s. Zerox Star available
in 1981 was the ﬁrst commercial computer system equipped
with a GUI. After several failed cases, Apple’s Macintosh,
introduced in 1984, was a major commercial success. It dom-
inated the GUI personal computer markets for the entire 1980s
(Press, 1990). Starting from Windows version 1, version 2, and
version 3, Microsoft kept trying to move DOS users away from
their command-line interface to a GUI interface and ﬁnally
achieved its dominant position in the GUI PC market after
introducing Windows 95 in 1995. Windows 98 was introduced
in 1998 and Windows 2000 was introduced in 2000, as their
names imply.
