This statement is true in general even when the dipoles are
not induced but intrinsic. Electrets are permanently polarized
dielectrics in complete analogy to magnets. They are charac-
terized by an internal P. Since P is a ﬂux density, its discontinu-
ity at the faces of an electret has the appearance of surface
charges on those faces to external observers. In fact, given any
region containing a distribution of P, its electric ﬁeld E over all
of space can be calculated by ﬁnding the equivalent charges
and replacing the electret by those charges. The charges are
found by:
