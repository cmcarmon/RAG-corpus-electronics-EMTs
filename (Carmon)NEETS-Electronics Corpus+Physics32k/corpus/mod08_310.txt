rapidly from +1 volt. Halfway between T1 and T2 (the dotted vertical line), input signal number one and
input signal number two are equal in amplitude. The difference between the input signals is 0 volts and
this causes the output signal to be 0 volts. From this point to T2 the difference between the input signals is
a negative value. At T2:
