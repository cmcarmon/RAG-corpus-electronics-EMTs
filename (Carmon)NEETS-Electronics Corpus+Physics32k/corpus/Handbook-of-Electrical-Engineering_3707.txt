In digital or saturation recording, the recording head is driven with sufﬁciently large currents that a portion
of the recording medium is driven into saturation. However, because of the gradient in the head ﬁelds, other
portions of the medium see ﬁelds less than those required for saturation. This is illustrated in Fig. 36.10 where
the contours for three different longitudinal ﬁelds are drawn. In this ﬁgure Hcr is the remanence coercivity or
the ﬁeld required to produce zero remanent magnetization in the medium after it was saturated in the opposite
direction,  and  H1  and  H2  are  ﬁelds  which  would  produce  negative  and  positive  remanent  magnetization,
respectively. Note that the head ﬁeld gradient is the sharpest near the pole tips of the head. This means that
smaller head-to-medium spacing and thinner medium both lead to narrower transitions being recorded.
