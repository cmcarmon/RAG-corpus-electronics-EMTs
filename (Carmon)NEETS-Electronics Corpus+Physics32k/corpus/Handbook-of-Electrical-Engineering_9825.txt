Our efforts in this section are concerned with analysis and design of linear control systems by frequency response
methods. Design generally involves trial-and-error repetition of analysis until a set of design speciÔ¨Åcations has
been  met.  Thus,  analysis  methods  are  most  useful  in  the  design  process,  which  is  one  phase  of  the systems
engineering life cycle [Sage, 1992]. We will discuss one design method based on Bode diagrams. We will discuss
the use of both simple series equalizers and composite equalizers as well as the use of minor-loop feedback in
systems design.
