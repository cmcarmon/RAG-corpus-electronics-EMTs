Another reference technique, the average head reference, uses the average activity of all active electrodes as
the common reference. In this approach, the activity at any one electrode will vary depending upon the activity
at the site of the reference electrode, which can be anywhere on the recording montage. Therefore, for N number
of recording electrodes, each being a potential reference, there are N – 1 possible voltage measurements at each
instant of time for each electrode. Maps constructed using the average head reference represent a unique solution
to  the  problem  of  active  reference  electrodes  in  that  the  average  reference  produces  an  amplitude-weighted
reference-free map of maximal and minimal ﬁeld potentials. Power maps constructed from the average reference
