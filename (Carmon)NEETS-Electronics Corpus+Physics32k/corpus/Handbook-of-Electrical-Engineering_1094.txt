The  sequence  f (nT)  can  be  viewed  as  representing  N  consecutive  samples  f (n)  of  the  continuous  signal,
while  the  sequence  F(k W)  can  be  considered  as  representing  N  consecutive  samples  F(k)  in  the  frequency
domain. Therefore, Eqs. (14.24) and (14.25) take the compact form
