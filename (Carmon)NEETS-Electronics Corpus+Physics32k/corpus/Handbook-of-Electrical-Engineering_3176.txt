The Methods of Control.  The PWM converters operate with a Ô¨Åxed-frequency, variable duty cycle. Depending
on the duty cycle, they can operate in either continuous current mode (CCM) or discontinuous current mode
(DCM). If the current through the output inductor never reaches zero (refer to Fig. 30.13), then the converter
operates in CCM; otherwise DCM occurs.
