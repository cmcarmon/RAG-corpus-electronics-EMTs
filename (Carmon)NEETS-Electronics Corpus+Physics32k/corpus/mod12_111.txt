When greater frequency stability is required, the oscillator should not be keyed, but should remain in 
continuous operation; other transmitter circuits may be keyed. This procedure keeps the oscillator tube at 
a normal operating temperature and offers less chance for frequency variations to occur each time the key 
is closed.
