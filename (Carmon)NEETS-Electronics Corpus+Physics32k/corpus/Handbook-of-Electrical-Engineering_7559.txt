Bipolar Transistor Gates
A logic circuit using bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) can be classiÔ¨Åed either as saturated or as nonsaturated
logic. A  saturated  logic  circuit  contains  at  least  one  BJT  that  is  saturated  in  one  of  the  stable  modes  of  the
circuit. In nonsaturated logic circuits none of the transistors is allowed to saturate. Since bringing a BJT out
of saturation requires a few additional nanoseconds (called the storage time), nonsaturated logic is faster. The
fastest  circuits  available  at  this  time  are  emitter-coupled  logic  (ECL),  with  transistor-transistor  logic  (TTL)
having Schottky diodes connected to prevent the transistors from saturating (Schottky TTL) being a fairly close
second. Both of these families are nonsaturated logic. All TTL families other than Schottky are saturated logic.
