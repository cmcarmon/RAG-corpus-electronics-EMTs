When n is large, the eigenstates are highly localized into the classical allowed region, that is, the region in which a classical particle with energy




E

n




{\displaystyle E_{n}}
can move. The eigenstates are peaked near the turning points, that is the points at the ends of the classically allowed region where the classical particle changes direction. This phenomenon can be verified using asymptotics of the Hermite polynomials, but can also be understood as being an instance of the WKB approximation. The frequency of oscillation at



x


{\displaystyle x}
is proportional to the momentum



p
(
x
)


{\displaystyle p(x)}
of a classical particle with energy




E

n




{\displaystyle E_{n}}
and position



x


{\displaystyle x}
. Meanwhile, the square of the amplitude (determining the probability density) is inversely proportional to



p
(
x
)


{\displaystyle p(x)}
, reflecting the amount of time the classical particle spends near



x


{\displaystyle x}
. The behavior in a small neighborhood of the turning point does not have a simple classical explanation, but can be modeled using an Airy function.
