Eventually, the voltage at the inverting input will 
have reached a value that causes the voltage at the 
inverting  input  to  exceed  that  present  at  the  non-
inverting  input.  At  this  point,  the  output  voltage 
will  rapidly  fall  to  2VCC. Capacitor,  C, will  then 
start to charge in the other direction and the voltage 
at 
fall 
exponentially.  
  Eventually, the voltage at the inverting input will 
have reached a value that causes the voltage at the 
inverting  input  to  be  less  than  that  present  at  the 
non-inverting  input.  At  this  point,  the  output 
voltage will rise rapidly to +VCC once again and the 
cycle will continue indefinitely.  
  The upper threshold voltage (i.e. the maximum 
positive value for the voltage at the inverting input) 
will be given by:
