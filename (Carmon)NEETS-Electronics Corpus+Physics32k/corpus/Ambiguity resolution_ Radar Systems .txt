Radar systems operating at a PRF below about 3 kHz pulse rate produce true range, but produce ambiguous target speed. Radar systems operating at a PRF above 30 kHz produce true target speed, but produce ambiguous target range.
Medium PRF systems produce both ambiguous range measurement and ambiguous radial speed measurement using PRF from 3 kHz to 30 kHz.
Ambiguity resolution finds true range and true speed by using ambiguous range and ambiguous speed measurements with multiple PRF.
