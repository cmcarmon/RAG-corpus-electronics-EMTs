With coupled inductors—such as when two or more coils
are wrapped around a common high permeability core—the
energy expression becomes more complicated. In the case of
two coupled inductors with currents I1 and I2 in coils 1 and 2,
respectively, the energy stored in the magnetic ﬁeld is (Paul
et al., 1998):
