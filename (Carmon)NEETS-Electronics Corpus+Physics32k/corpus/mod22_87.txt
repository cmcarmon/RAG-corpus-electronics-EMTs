There are virtually unlimited applications for the computer in today's modern business world, from 
basic accounting functions to controlling the manufacture of products, and of course, keeping records of 
these actions. Six standard systems dealing with accounting applications are widely accepted. These 
systems are (1) order entry; (2) inventory control; (3) accounts receivable; (4) accounts payable; (5) 
general ledger; and (6) payroll. (Figure 1-10 shows a simplified flowchart of payroll.) The area of 
recordkeeping has two requirements, legal and audit. The Navy has included similar functions in its 
Shipboard Non-Tactical ADP Program for work center use.
