The Bethe-hole coupler consists of two stacked waveguides
with small-hole dipole coupling on the common broad wall
or sidewall of the guides, the cross-guide coupler consists of
two joint waveguides that are coupled through the crossed
slots on the broadside of the guides. The cross-guide coupler
has an added-up forward coupling due to a backward cancel-
lation of the two excited waves generated by the crossed slots.
The short-slot coupler couples electromagnetic energy of the
TE10 (even) and TE20 (odd) modes along the common cross
section of the two guides. This coupler design is actually
derived from the parallel-line principle but results in forward
coupling instead of backward coupling. This difference is
caused by the different nature of the mode coupling.
