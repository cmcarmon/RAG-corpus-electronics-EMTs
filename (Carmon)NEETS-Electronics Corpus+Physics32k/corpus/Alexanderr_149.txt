It  is  helpful  to  be  familiar  with  both  methods  of  analysis,  for  at
least  two  reasons.  First,  one  method  can  be  used  to  check  the  results
from the other method, if possible. Second, since each method has its
limitations, only one method may be suitable for a particular problem.
For example, mesh analysis is the only method to use in analyzing tran-
sistor  circuits,  as  we  shall  see  in  Section  3.9.  But  mesh  analysis  can-
not easily be used to solve an op amp circuit, as we shall see in Chapter 5,
because there is no direct way to obtain the voltage across the op amp
itself.  For  nonplanar  networks,  nodal  analysis  is  the  only  option,
because  mesh  analysis  only  applies  to  planar  networks.  Also,  nodal
analysis is more amenable to solution by computer, as it is easy to pro-
gram.  This  allows  one  to  analyze  complicated  circuits  that  defy  hand
calculation. A computer  software  package  based  on  nodal  analysis  is
introduced next.
