It can be shown that the angular momentum equation given above also relates the rate of change in true anomaly to r, v and φ, thus the true anomaly can be found as a function of time since periapsis passage by integration:




ν
=

r

p



v

p



∫


t

p




t




1

r

2




d
t


{\displaystyle \nu =r_{p}v_{p}\int _{t_{p}}^{t}{\frac {1}{r^{2}}}dt}

Conversely, the time required to reach a given anomaly is:




t
=


1


r

p



v

p






∫

0


ν



r

2


d
ν


{\displaystyle t={\frac {1}{r_{p}v_{p}}}\int _{0}^{\nu }r^{2}d\nu }
