Unfortunately,  it  is  not  so  easy  to  predict  the 
voltage  present  at  the  collector-base  junction  of  a 
transistor. The junction is invariably reverse biased 
and  the  potential  present  will  vary  considerably 
depending upon the magnitude of collector current, 
supply voltage, and circuit conditions. As a rule-of-
thumb,  small-signal  amplifiers  using  resistive 
collector  loads  usually  operate  with  a  collector-
emitter voltage which is approximately half that of 
the collector supply. The collector-base voltage will 
be slightly less than this. Hence, for a stage that is 
operated  from  a  decoupled  supply  rail  of,  say,  
8.5 V a reasonable collector-base voltage would be 
somewhere  in  the  range  3  V  to  4  V.  Tuned 
amplifiers  having 
loads 
generally operate with a somewhat higher value of 
collector-emitter  voltage 
is  no 
appreciable direct voltage drop across the load. As 
a result, the collector-base voltage drop is greater (a 
typical  value  being  6  V).  Figure  15.3  shows  the 
electrode  potentials  normally  associated  with 
transistors  operating 
small-signal 
amplifiers.
