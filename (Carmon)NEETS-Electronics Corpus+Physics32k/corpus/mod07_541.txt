During the period when the input cycle is negative, as shown in view B, the polarity across the 
secondary of the transformer is reversed. Note specifically that the top of the secondary winding is now 
positive. This condition now forward biases CR2 and reverse biases CR1. A series circuit now exists 
consisting of C1, CR2, C2, and the secondary of the transformer. The current flow is indicated by the 
arrows. The secondary voltage of the transformer now aids the voltage on C1. This results in a pulsating 
dc voltage of 400 volts, as shown by the waveform. The effect of series aiding is comparable to the 
connection of two 200-volt batteries in series. As shown in figure 4-46, C2 charges to the sum of these 
voltages, or 400 volts.
