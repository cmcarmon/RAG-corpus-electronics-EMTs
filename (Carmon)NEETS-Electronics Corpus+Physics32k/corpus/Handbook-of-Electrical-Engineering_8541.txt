Levels of Programming
In Fig. 86.12, we see that a computer application is usually realized by programming a given algorithm in a
high-level language. A system offering a high-level language capability is implemented at the system level via
a compiler. The operating system is (usually) implemented in a lower-level language. The machine instruction
set can be hardwired (in a hardware implementation) or implemented via microprogramming (Fig. 86.11).
