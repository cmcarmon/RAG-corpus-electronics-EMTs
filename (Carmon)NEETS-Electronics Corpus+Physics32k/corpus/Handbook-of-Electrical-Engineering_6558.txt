In addition to having low loss, good connectors and splices also minimize back reﬂections. This is especially
important for connections near the transmitter to reduce laser noise. Fusion splices produce little reﬂection,
but  mechanical  splices  and  all  connectors  must  be  carefully  designed  to  keep  reﬂected  power  levels  low.
Reﬂections  occur  because  of  small  gaps  at  the  interface  between  the  mated  ﬁbers.  Successful  techniques  for
reducing  reﬂections  include  the  physical  contact  connection,  where  the  ﬁber  end  faces  are  polished  into
hemispheres (rather than ﬂat surfaces) so that the cores of the two mated ﬁbers are in contact with each other.
Even better performance is obtained by angling the end faces a few degrees so that reﬂected light is ﬁltered out
of the single propagating mode.
