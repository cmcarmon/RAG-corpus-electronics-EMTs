A computer has Ô¨Åve functionally independent main parts: input, memory, arithmetic and logic, output, and
control. The input unit accepts digitally encoded information from human operators, through electromechan-
ical devices such as a keyboard, or from other computers over digital communication lines. The information
received is usually stored in the memory and then operated on by the arithmetic and logic unit circuitry under
the control of a program. Results are sent back to the outside world through the output unit. All these actions
are coordinated by the control unit. The arithmetic and logic unit, in conjunction with the main control unit,
are referred to as the processor.
