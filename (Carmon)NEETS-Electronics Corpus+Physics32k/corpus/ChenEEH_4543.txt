The advantage of the component connection model over the
classical graphical and diagrammatic connection models is
that, being inherently algebraic, the component connection
model
is readily manipulated and amenable to numerical
techniques. Moreover, this model uniÔ¨Åes the various graphical
and diagrammatic models. In fact, electronic circuits, which
are commonly described by hybrid block diagram-linear graph
models, are handled as readily as passive circuits or analog
computer diagrams [see DeCarlo and Saeks (1981) for some
simple examples].
