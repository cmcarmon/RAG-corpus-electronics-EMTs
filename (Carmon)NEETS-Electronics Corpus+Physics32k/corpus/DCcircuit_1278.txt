When capacitors are connected in series, the total capacitance is less than any one of the
series capacitors’ individual capacitances. If two or more capacitors are connected in series,
the overall effect is that of a single (equivalent) capacitor having the sum total of the plate
spacings of the individual capacitors. As we’ve just seen, an increase in plate spacing, with all
other factors unchanged, results in decreased capacitance.
