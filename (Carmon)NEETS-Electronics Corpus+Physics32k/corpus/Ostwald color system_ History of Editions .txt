The Color Harmony Manuals were published beginning in 1942, and have been out of print since 1972.
Ostwald's first Color Harmony Manual was a set of 12 handbooks showing complementary hues. The first edition was published in 1942. It contained 680 color chips. Each color chip was a 5/8 inch square and had a tab where the Ostwald notation was written.
A Color Harmony Index was also produced. It used used larger 1 inch square color chips. But, due to its price only a few were sold.
In 1945, Walter C. Granville was asked to produce a second edition. The second edition used the chips from the Color Harmony Index but was formatted up the same way as the first edition. The second edition is also called the large chip edition. By 1948 all copies of both the first and second edition had sold.
The third edition was published in February 1949. A different colorimetric base was used for the third edition, so the colors are approximate matches to the colors of the first and second editions.There was also a second production of the third edition to reuse batches of the liquors used to make the color chip stock.
The fourth edition was published in 1958. It was sold until 1972. A different base lacquer formula was used in the fourth edition, and there was a substitute of some pigments. Most notably in one of the yellows. In 1971, Granville was asked to compare the colors of the third and fourth editions. He found that the fourth edition did not met the third editions standards. Colors between the fourth edition did not match the colors of the first edition as closely as the third edition had. This was confirmed by W. N. Hale and the fourth edition was discontinued.
The overproduction of color chips for the third and fourth editions lead to sales of individual chips.
