Thus, optimum detection can be implemented via comparison of (73.8) with a threshold, a structure known
envelope detector. 
Note that this detector correlates the measurements with two orthogonal components
as an 
v
k
).  These  two  correlations,  known  as  the  in-phase  and  quadrature
k
)  and 
of  the  signal, 
c
components of the measurements, respectively, capture all of the energy in the signal, regardless of the value
u
. Since u is unknown, however, these two correlations cannot be combined coherently, and thus they are
of 
combined noncoherently via (73.8) before the result is compared with a threshold. This detector is illustrated
in Fig. 73.2.
