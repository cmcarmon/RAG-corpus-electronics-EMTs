Trigonometric Fourier Series
Although the complex form of the Fourier series expansion is useful for complex periodic signals, the Fourier
series can be more easily expressed in terms of real-valued sine and cosine functions for real-valued periodic
signals. In the following discussion it will be assumed that the signal s(t) is real valued for the sake of simplifying
the discussion. When s(t) is periodic and real valued it is convenient to replace the complex exponential form
of the Fourier series with a trigonometric expansion that contains sin(wot) and cos(wot) terms with corre-
sponding real-valued coefÔ¨Åcients [Van Valkenburg, 1974]. The trigonometric form of the Fourier series for a
real-valued signal s(t) is given by
