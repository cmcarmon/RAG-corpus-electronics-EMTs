one gas tube is required to discharge the pulse-forming network, and a low amplitude trigger pulse is
sufficient to initiate discharge. A damping diode is used to prevent breakdown of the thyratron by
reverse-voltage transients. The thyratron requires a sharp leading edge for a trigger pulse and depends on
a sudden drop in anode voltage (controlled by the pulse-forming network) to terminate the pulse and cut
off the tube.
