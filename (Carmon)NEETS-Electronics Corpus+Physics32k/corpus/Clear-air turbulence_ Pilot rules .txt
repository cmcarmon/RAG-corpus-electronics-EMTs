When a pilot experiences CAT, a number of rules should be applied:
The aircraft must sustain the recommended velocity for turbulence.
When following the jet stream to escape from the CAT, the aircraft must change altitude and/or heading.
When the CAT arrives from one side of the airplane, the pilot must observe the thermometer to determine whether the aircraft is above or below the jet stream and then move away from the tropopause.
When the CAT is associated with a sharp trough, the plane must go through the low-pressure region instead of around it.
The pilot may issue a Pilot Report (PIREP), communicating position, altitude and severity of the turbulence to warn other aircraft entering the region.
