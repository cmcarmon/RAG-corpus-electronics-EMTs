Current-Fed Inverter Induction Motor Drive
The  speed  of  a  machine  can  be  controlled  by  a  current-fed  inverter  as  shown  in  Fig.  30.46.  The  front-end
thyristor rectiﬁer generates a variable dc current source in the dc link inductor. The dc current is then converted
to six-step machine current wave through the inverter. The basic mode of operation of the inverter is the same
as  that  of  the  rectiﬁer,  except  that  it  is  force-commutated,  that  is,  the  capacitors  and  series  diodes  help
commutation  of  the  thyristors.  One  advantage  of  the  drive  is  that  regenerative  braking  is  easy  because  the
