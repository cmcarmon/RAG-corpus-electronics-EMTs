In this chapter, emphasis has been placed on using middle-
ware for integrating complex control systems. As mentioned
previously, middleware is beneﬁcial for its ability to hide the
network communications decisions from the user, its reuse in
integrating multiple control system applications, and its ease
of system evolution and reconﬁguration. A further beneﬁt
from some middleware is its ability to integrate software writ-
ten in different languages and running on different platforms.
The development of middleware for control system applica-
tions is rather new. One commercial product that uses a real-
time publish and subscribe communication model is NDDS
made by Real-Time Innovations (RTI). NDDS has good per-
formance for relatively fast periodic events, which is the case
for the low-level stability augmentation controller used in
ﬂight controls. RTI also markets ControlShell, a graphics tool
that allows integration of control systems in an object-oriented
fashion. Consult the RTI Web site for more information on the
publish and subscribe communications model for use in con-
trols. While no commercial products currently use CORBA for
control systems, a CORBA-based software substrate for con-
trols is under development (Wills et al., 2001). Extensions to
CORBA and links to CORBA-based products for other appli-
cations can be found on the OMG Web site.
