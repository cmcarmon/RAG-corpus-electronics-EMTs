The simplest second-order circuit is the undriven circuit having one capacitor
and one inductor, shown in Figure 12.6. It is lossless because it contains no
elements that dissipate energy. That is, it contains no resistors. It is undriven
because it contains no independent sources to provide external stimuli. There-
fore, it offers us the opportunity to focus on the internal, or homogeneous,
behavior of the circuit itself. The undriven response is also the Zero Input
Response (ZIR) of the circuit. Of course, without a source one should ask how
did the operation of the circuit begin. We will temporarily defer the answer to
this question and simply assume for the moment that its branch voltages and
currents are not all zero.
