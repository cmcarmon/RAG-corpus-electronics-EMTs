Other structures can be present on the vaginal wall though most of the time these can be differentiated from rugae. Vaginal cysts can be small protrusions into the vagina that can be felt or palpated by a clinician. Vaginal inclusion cysts can appear as small bumps and can develop after childbirth. Other small structures or protrusions can be Gardner duct cysts, patches of endometrial tissue, and benign tumors. These cystic structures can obliterate the rugae and is a clue to their presence. The absence of vaginal rugae seen in the normal vagina of a healthy women may be an indication of a prolapsed bladder (cycstocele) or rectocele. An enterocele, or bulging of the bowel into the vagina can also cause vaginal rugae disappear. The absence of vaginal rugae may also be an indicator of pelvic organ prolapse. Vaginal rugae disappear in those with an estrogen deficiency.
