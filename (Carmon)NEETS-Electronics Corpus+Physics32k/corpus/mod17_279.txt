Figure 2-32 shows a diagram of typical headphones used with Navy equipment. The device consists
of a permanent magnet and two small electromagnets through which the signal currents pass. A soft iron
diaphragm is used to convert the electrical effects of the device into sound power. When no signal
currents are present, the permanent magnet exerts a steady pull on the soft iron diaphragm. Signal current
flowing through the coils mounted on the soft iron pole pieces develops a magnetomotive force that either
adds to or subtracts from the field of the permanent magnet. The diaphragm thus moves in or out
according to the resultant field. Sound waves are then reproduced that have an amplitude and frequency
(within the mechanical capability of the reproducer) similar to the amplitude and frequency of the signal
currents.
