The anomaly remains unresolved and is an active area of research. There is as yet no conclusive reason to doubt the validity of the old data. The immediate concern is for other groups to reproduce the anomaly. The uncertain nature of the experimental evidence has not stopped theorists from attempting to explain the conflicting results. Among the postulated explanations are the three-body force, interactions between gravity and the weak force or a flavour-dependent interaction, higher dimension gravity, a new boson, and the quasi-free Ï€+ hypothesis.
Randolf Pohl, the original investigator of the puzzle, stated that while it would be "fantastic" if the puzzle led to a new discovery, the most likely explanation is not new physics but some measurement artifact. His personal assumption is that past measurements have misgauged the Rydberg constant and that the current official proton size is inaccurate.
