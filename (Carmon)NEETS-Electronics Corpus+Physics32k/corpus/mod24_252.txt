Figure 3-3 shows a possible refractive index profile n(r) for a multimode graded-index fiber. Notice
the parabolic refractive index profile of the core. The profile parameter ( a ) determines the shape of the
core's profile. As the value of a increases, the shape of the core's profile changes from a triangular shape
to step as shown in figure 3-4. Most multimode graded-index fibers have a parabolic refractive index
profile. Multimode fibers with near parabolic graded-index profiles provide the best performance. Unless
otherwise specified, when discussing multimode graded-index fibers, assume that the core's refractive
index profile is parabolic ( a =2).
