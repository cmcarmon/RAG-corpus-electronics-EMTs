In Killing Field by Charles Sheffield, he envisaged ships with a disk containing a flat arrangement of black holes at the nose, with a moveable crew capsule. When the ship was not accelerating, the crew compartment was positioned to give a comfortable 1g downwards towards the nose, but as the ship accelerated at up to 50g, the crew compartment was moved closer to the nose to cancel the acceleration effects and keep the crew comfortable.
