The two identical planetaries are interdependent. Their suns are bonded - in practice, both gearsets share a longer sun gear. The planet support of the first gearset ("first" meaning closer to engine input shaft) is in synchronism with the second gearset's ring, and both are in synchronism with the output shaft.
Due to these links, two bands and two clutches are all that is needed to command the gearsets and extract the different gears. As many as six forward gears can easily be developed from a Simpson box, just by adding a third gearset (underdrive or overdrive) which is operated independently, to create two ranges for each gear.
