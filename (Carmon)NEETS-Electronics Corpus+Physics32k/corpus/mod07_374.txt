The ZENER DIODE is a PN junction that is designed to operate in the reverse-bias breakdown 
mode. When the applied voltage reaches the breakdown point, the Zener diode, for all practical purposes, 
becomes a short circuit. The reverse bias and breakdown mode of operation cause the Zener diode to 
conduct with (in the direction of) the arrow in the symbol as shown.
