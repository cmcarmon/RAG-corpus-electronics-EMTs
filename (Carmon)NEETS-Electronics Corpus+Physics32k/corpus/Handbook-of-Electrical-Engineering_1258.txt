Theorem 11. Let  Cnnd  designate  the  set  of  all  ﬁnite-  and  inﬁnite-length  nonnegative-deﬁnite  time  series.  It
follows  that  Cnnd  is  a  closed  convex  cone  whose  vertex  is  located  at  the  origin.  Moreover,  every  time  series
contained in this cone is conjugate symmetric so that x(–n) = 
(n) for all integers n. Furthermore, the data
matrix of order k formed from any nonnegative-deﬁnite time series {x(n)} ˛ Cnnd and having the Hermitian-
Toeplitz structure given by
