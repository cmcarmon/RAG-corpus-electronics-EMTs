The basic idea is that the amplifier transfer function appears linear for small
perturbations in the input voltage about a given bias point. We can arrive at the
same result analytically. Suppose that the amplifier is biased at some bias point:
(VI, VO). Now suppose that we superimpose a small signal vI = vi on VI as
depicted in Figure 8.5. An example of a DC signal with a small superimposed
time-varying signal is shown in Figure 8.6.
