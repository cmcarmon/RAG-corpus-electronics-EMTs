Each timing pulse from the 555 chip triggers the decade counter to count, 
so the 10 outputs of the decade counter go high one at a time every 3 to 10 
seconds (depending on the value of R1). Because the first four outputs of the 
4017 chip (pins 3, 2, 4, and 7, in that order) are connected (through diodes) 
to the green LED (LED1), the green LED will light up and remain lit during the 
first four pulses from the 555 timer chip. The fifth output of the 4017 chip 
(pin 10) is connected to the yellow LED (LED2), so it will light up for the dura-
tion of the fifth timing pulse. Because the sixth through tenth outputs (pins 
1, 5, 6, 9, and 11, in that order) of the 4017 chip are tied (through diodes) to 
the red LED (LED3), the red LED will light up and stay lit for the sixth through 
tenth timing pulses. Then, the cycle will repeat. (See Figure 17-11.)
