Drives fed from a load-commutated current-source inverter or a cycloconverter Ô¨Ånd applica-
tions in high-speed high-power drives such as compressors, conveyors, traction, steel mills, and
ship propulsion. The drives fed from a line-commutated cycloconverter are used in low-speed
gearless drives for mine hoists and ball mills in cement production. Self-controlled permanent-
magnet synchronous-motor drives are replacing the dc-motor drives in servo applications.
