Structured Distribution Systems
A  number  of  ﬁrms  in  the  research  study  had  deployed  a structured distribution system (SDS),  a  topology
which advocates cabling saturation of a desired environment to accommodate all potential personnel move-
ments and reconstructions within that ofﬁce. SDS requires ﬁrms to invest large sums of capital initially on the
assumption of not knowing how many telecommunications devices may be employed or where the devices are
to be located. Consequently SDS usually plans for worst-case conditions, meaning that some or much of wiring
systems capability may never be utilized.
