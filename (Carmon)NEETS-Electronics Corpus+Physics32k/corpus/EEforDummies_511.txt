A graphic equalizer uses a series of tuning circuits to separate an audio 
signal into several frequency bands. The slide controls on the equalizer allow 
you to adjust the gain (amplification) of each frequency band independently. 
In a later circuit stage, the individual bands are recombined into one audio 
signal — customized according to your taste — that is sent to your speakers.
