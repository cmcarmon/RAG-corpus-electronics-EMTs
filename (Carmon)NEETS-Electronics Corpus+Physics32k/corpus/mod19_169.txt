Table 1-6 is a resistor selection chart. As an example, let's suppose you need a 1-watt, composition 
resistor. Look under the "type" heading to find composition. Then look under the "power and max voltage 
ratings" headings to find 1W/500V. The style you select should be RCR32. This is the first part of the part 
number. To find the last part of the desired part number, the ohmic value, refer to table 1-7, the resistor 
type designation part number breakdown.
