You can convert the 100-microampere instrument to a 10-ampere meter by using a proper shunt. The
voltage drop for a full-scale deflection is still 0.01 volt across the coil and the shunt. The meter current is
still 100 microamperes. The shunt current must therefore be 9.9999 amperes under full-scale deflection.
Again, this is an approximate figure found by the application of Ohmâ€™s law.
