In most applications, the sharp cutoff feature of conventional electron tubes causes no problems.
However, in some applications electron tubes are required to amplify relatively large input signals
without distortion. For this reason, the variable-mu tube was developed. VARIABLE-MU TUBES have
the ability to reduce their mu, or (µ), as the input signal gets larger. As the mu (µ) decreases, the
likelihood that the tube will be driven into cutoff decreases. (For an amplifier, this may appear to be self-
defeating, but it isn't.) The idea is to amplify large input signals as much as possible without causing the
tube to cutoff or create distortion. Because of their ability to avoid being driven into cutoff, variable-mu
tubes are called REMOTE-CUTOFF TUBES. You should be aware, however, that a variable-mu tube
can be driven into cutoff, but the amplitude of the input signal required to do so is considerably greater
than in conventional sharp-cutoff tubes.
