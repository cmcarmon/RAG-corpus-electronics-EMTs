Hydrogen and helium are the most commonly used lift gases. Although helium is twice as heavy as (diatomic) hydrogen, they are both significantly lighter than air, making this difference negligible.
The lifting power in air of hydrogen and helium can be calculated using the theory of buoyancy as follows:
The density at sea-level and 0 °C for air and each of the gases is:
Air (ρair) = 1.292 kg/m3 = 0.0807 lb/ft3.
Hydrogen (ρH2) = 0.090 kg/m3
Helium (ρHe) = 0.178 kg/m3
Thus helium is almost twice as dense as hydrogen. However, buoyancy depends upon the difference of the densities (ρgas) − (ρair) rather than upon their ratios. Thus the difference in buoyancies is about 8%, as seen from the buoyancy equation:
FB=(ρair - ρgas) * g * V
Where FB = Buoyant force (in Newton); g = gravitational acceleration = 9.8066 m/s² = 9.8066 N/kg; V = volume (in m³).
Therefore, the amount of mass that can be lifted by hydrogen in air at sea level, equal to the density difference between hydrogen and air, is:
(1.292 - 0.090) kg/m3 = 1.202 kg/m3
and the buoyant force for one m³ of hydrogen in air at sea level is:
1 m3 * 1.202 kg * 9.8 N/kg= 11.8 N
Therefore, the amount of mass that can be lifted by helium in air at sea level is:
(1.292 - 0.178) kg/m3 = 1.114 kg/m3
and the buoyant force for one m³ of helium in air at sea level is:
1 m3 * 1.114 kg/m³ * 9.8 N/kg= 10.9 N
Thus hydrogen's additional buoyancy compared to helium is:
11.8 / 10.9 ≈ 1.08, or approximately 8.0%
This calculation is at sea level at 0 °C. For higher altitudes, or higher temperatures, the amount of lift will decrease proportionally to the air density, but the ratio of the lifting capability of hydrogen to that of helium will remain the same. This calculation does not include the mass of the envelope need to hold the lifting gas.
