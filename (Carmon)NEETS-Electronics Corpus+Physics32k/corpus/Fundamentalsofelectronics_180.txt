At this point, we could learn how to solve diﬀerential equations. Note ﬁrst that even ﬁnding the diﬀerential
equation relating an output variable to a source is often very tedious. The parallel and series combination
rules that apply to resistors don’t directly apply when capacitors and inductors occur. We would have to slog
our way through the circuit equations, simplifying them until we ﬁnally found the equation that related the
source(s) to the output. At the turn of the twentieth century, a method was discovered that not only made
ﬁnding the diﬀerential equation easy, but also simpliﬁed the solution process in the most common situation.
Although not original with him, Charles Steinmetz18 presented the key paper describing the impedance
approach in 1893. It allows circuits containing capacitors and inductors to be solved with the same methods
we have learned to solved resistor circuits. To use impedances, we must master complex numbers. Though
the arithmetic of complex numbers is mathematically more complicated than with real numbers, the increased
insight into circuit behavior and the ease with which circuits are solved with impedances is well worth the
diversion. But more importantly, the impedance concept is central to engineering and physics, having a
reach far beyond just circuits.
