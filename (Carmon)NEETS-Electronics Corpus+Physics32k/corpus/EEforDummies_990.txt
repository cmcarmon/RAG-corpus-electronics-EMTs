Power for a circuit can come from an AC source, such as the 120 VAC outlet 
in your house or office (such circuits are called line‐powered). You typically 
use an internal power supply to step down (or lower) the 120 VAC and convert 
it to DC. This lower‐voltage DC power is then delivered to the components in 
your circuit. If you’re looking at a schematic for a DVD player or some other 
gadget getting its power from a wall outlet, that schematic probably shows 
both AC and DC power.
