It is also possible to justify the London equations by other means. Current density is defined according to the equation






j

s


e

v

.


{\displaystyle \mathbf {j} _{s}=-n_{s}e\mathbf {v} .}

Taking this expression from a classical description to a quantum mechanical one, we must replace values j and v by the expectation values of their operators. The velocity operator





v

=


1
m



(


p

−
e

A


)



{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} ={\frac {1}{m}}\left(\mathbf {p} -e\mathbf {A} \right)}

is defined by dividing the gauge-invariant, kinematic momentum operator by the particle mass m. We may then make this replacement in the equation above. However, an important assumption from the microscopic theory of superconductivity is that the superconducting state of a system is the ground state, and according to a theorem of Bloch's, in such a state the canonical momentum p is zero. This leaves






j

n

A

,


{\displaystyle \mathbf {j} _{s}=-{\frac {n_{s}e_{s}^{2}}{m}}\mathbf {A} ,}

which is the London equation according to the second formulation above.
