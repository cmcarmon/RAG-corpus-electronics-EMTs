Mitre gears are a type of bevel gears that have equal numbers of teeth. The shafts are positioned at right angles from each other, and the gears have matching pitch surfaces and angles, with a conically shaped pitch surface.
Mitre gears are useful for transmitting rotational motion at a 90 degree angle with a 1:1 ratio.
