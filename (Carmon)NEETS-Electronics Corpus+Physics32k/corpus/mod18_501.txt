If power from the ship service distribution system is interrupted, the emergency power distribution 
system is activated. The emergency system supplies an immediate and automatic source of electrical 
power to selected loads that are vital to the safety and defense of the ship. This system includes one or 
more emergency diesel generators and switchboards. The emergency generator is started automatically 
when a sensor detects the loss of normal power.
