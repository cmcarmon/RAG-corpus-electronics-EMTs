A  disadvantage  of  the  fuse  is  that  it  must  be 
 replaced each time it blows. A circuit breaker per-
forms the same job but does not have to be replaced 
each time an overload occurs. Instead, the circuit 
breaker can be manually reset after the overload 
 occurs ( FigureÂ  36-45). Circuit breakers are connected 
into the circuit in the same manner as fuses.
