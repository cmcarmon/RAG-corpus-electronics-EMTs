Using very large scale integration (VLSI) technology, DSP algorithms can be prototyped in many ways. These
options  include  (1)  single  or  multiprocessor  programmable  digital  signal  processors,  (2)  the  use  of  core
programmable digital signal processor with customized interface logic, (3) semicustom gate-array implemen-
tations, and (4) full-custom dedicated hardware implementation. The DSP algorithms are implemented in the
programmable  processors  by  translating  the  algorithm  to  the  processor  assembly  code.  This  can  require  an
extensive amount of time. On the other hand, high-level compilers for DSP can be used to generate the assembly
code. Although this is currently feasible, the code generated by the compiler is not as efﬁcient as hand-optimized
code. Design of DSP compilers for generation of efﬁcient code is still an active research topic. In the case of
