Consider the RC circuit in Fig. 7.40(a) which can be replaced by
the  circuit  in  Fig.  7.40(b),  where 
is  a  constant  dc  voltage  source.
Again,  we  select  the  capacitor  voltage  as  the  circuit  response  to  be
determined. We assume an initial voltage 
on the capacitor, although
this is not necessary for the step response. Since the voltage of a capac-
itor cannot change instantaneously,
