The most widely used process is the modiﬁed chemical vapor deposition (MCVD) process invented at the
AT&T Bell Laboratories. Outside vapor deposition process (OVD) is used by Corning Glass Works and some
of its joint ventures in Europe. Vapor axial deposition (VAD) process is the process used most widely in Japan.
Philips, in Eindhoven, Netherlands, uses a low-temperature plasma chemical vapor deposition (PCVD) process.
In addition to the above four major processes, other processes are under development in different labora-
tories. Plasma MCVD is under development at Bell Laboratories, hybrid OVD-VAD processes are being devel-
oped in Japan, and Sol-Gel processes are being developed in several laboratories. The ﬁrst four processes are
the established commercial processes and are producing ﬁber economically. The new processes are aimed at
greatly increasing the manufacturing productivity of preforms, and thereby reducing their cost.
