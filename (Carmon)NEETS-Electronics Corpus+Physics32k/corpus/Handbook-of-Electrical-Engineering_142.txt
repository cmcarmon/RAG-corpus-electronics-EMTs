Liquid-ﬁlled transformers are cooled by natural or forced circulation of a liquid coolant through the windings
of the transformer. This liquid also serves as a dielectric to provide superior voltage-withstand characteristics.
The most commonly used liquid in a transformer is a mineral oil known as transformer oil that has a continuous
operating  temperature  rating  of  105(cid:176)C,  a  ﬂash  point  of  150(cid:176)C,  and  a  ﬁre  point  of  180(cid:176)C.  A  good  grade
transformer oil has a breakdown strength of 86.6 kV/cm (220 kV/in.) that is far higher than the breakdown
strength of air, which is 9.84 kV/cm (25 kV/in.) at atmospheric pressure.
