We note the 1=2 increment in the i subscript (x coordinate)
of u, denoting a space ﬁnite difference over Dx=2. Yee’s goal
(1966) was second-order accurate central differencing, but it is
apparent that he desired to take data for his central differences
to the right and left of his observation point by only Dx=2,
rather than a full Dx.
