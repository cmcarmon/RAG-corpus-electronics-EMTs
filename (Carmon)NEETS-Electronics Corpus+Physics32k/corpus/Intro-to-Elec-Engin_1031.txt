If none of the inductances is a function of the mechanical variable θm, no electromagnetic
torque is developed. If, on the other hand, the self-inductances L11 and L22 are independent of
the angle θm, the reluctance torque is zero and the torque is produced only by the mutual term
L12(θm), as seen from Equation (12.4.25). Let us consider such a case in the following example
on the basis of the coupled-circuit viewpoint (or coupled-coils approach).
