level. Keying the oscillator stage usually results in 
impaired  frequency  stability.  On  the  other  hand, 
attempting  to  interrupt  the  appreciable  currents 
and/or voltages that appear in the power amplifier 
stage can also prove to be somewhat problematic. 
  The simplest form of CW receiver need consist 
of  nothing  more  than  a  radio  frequency  amplifier 
(which provides gain and selectivity) followed by a 
detector and an audio amplifier. The detector stage 
mixes  a  locally  generated  radio  frequency  signal 
produced by the beat frequency oscillator (BFO) 
with the incoming signal to produce a signal within 
the audio frequency range. 
  As an example, assume that the incoming signal 
is  at  a  frequency  of  100  kHz  and  that  the  BFO  is 
producing  a  signal  at  99  kHz.  A  signal  at  the 
difference  between  these  two  frequencies  (1  kHz) 
will appear at the output of the detector stage. This 
will then be amplified within the audio stage before 
being fed to the loudspeaker.
