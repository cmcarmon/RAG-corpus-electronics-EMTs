Seeing the light with LEDs
All diodes release energy in the form of light when forward‐biased. The light 
released by standard silicon diodes is in the infrared range, which is not 
 visible to the human eye. Infrared light‐emitting diodes (IR LEDs) are com­
monly used in remote‐control devices to send secret (well, okay, invisible) 
messages to other electronic devices, such as your TV or DVD player.
