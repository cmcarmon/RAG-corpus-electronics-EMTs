The Ô¨Årst design innovation contributes to improved performance primarily by increasing the light-generated
current. The second innovation leads to increases in light-generated current for a direct bandgap material and
to  increased  voltage  in  all  materials.  The  next  four  lead  to  decreases  in  minority  carrier  recombination,  and
increased open-circuit voltage.
