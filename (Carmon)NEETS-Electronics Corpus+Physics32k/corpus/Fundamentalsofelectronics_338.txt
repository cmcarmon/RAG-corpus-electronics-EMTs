Problem 3.51: Reverse Engineering
The circuit depicted in Figure 3.91 has been developed by the TBBG Electronics design group. They are
trying to keep its use secret; we, representing RU Electronics, have discovered the schematic and want to
Ô¨Ågure out the intended application. Assume the diode is ideal.
