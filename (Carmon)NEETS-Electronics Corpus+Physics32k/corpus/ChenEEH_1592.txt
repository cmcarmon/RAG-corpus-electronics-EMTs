To perform backward-chaining reasoning, the top-level goal,
p(X), is placed in the working memory as shown in Figure
5.3(A), where X is a variable that can match with any object.
The conclusions of three rules (rules 2, 3, and 4) match with
the expression in the working memory. If we solve conﬂicts in
favor of the lower-numbered rule, then rule 2 will be selected
and ﬁre. This causes X to be bound to s1 and the two premises
of rule 2 to be placed in the working memory as in Figure
5.3(B). Then, since the conclusion of rule 1 matches with a fact
in the working memory, we then ﬁre rule 1 and place its
promises in the working memory as in Figure 5.3(C). At this
point, there are three entries in the working memory (a, b, d)
that do not match with any rule conclusion. The expert system
will query the user directly about these subgoals. If the user
conﬁrms them as true, the expert system will have successfully
determined the causes for the top-level goal p(X).
