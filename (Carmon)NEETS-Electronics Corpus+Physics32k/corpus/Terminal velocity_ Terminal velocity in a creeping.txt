For very slow motion of the fluid, the inertia forces of the fluid are negligible (assumption of massless fluid) in comparison to other forces. Such flows are called creeping flows and the condition to be satisfied for the flows to be creeping flows is the Reynolds number,



R
e
≪

{\displaystyle Re\ll 1}
. The equation of motion for creeping flow (simplified Navier–Stokes equation) is given by

where

μ


{\displaystyle \mu }
is the liquid\fluid viscosity.
The analytical solution for the creeping flow around a sphere was first given by Stokes in 1851. From Stokes' solution, the drag force acting on the sphere can be obtained as

When the value of
