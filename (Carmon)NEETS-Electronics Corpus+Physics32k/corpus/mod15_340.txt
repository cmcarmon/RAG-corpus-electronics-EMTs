A gyro mounted in two gimbals has two degrees of freedom. When two gimbals are used, the gyro is 
said to be UNIVERSALLY MOUNTED. This arrangement provides two axes about which the gyro can 
precess. These two axes and the spin axis intersect at the center of gravity of the entire system (excluding 
the support). Because of this arrangement, the force of gravity does not exert a torque to cause precession. 
The rotor, inner gimbal, and outer gimbal are balanced about the three principal axes.
