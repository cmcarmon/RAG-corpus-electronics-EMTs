Physicists and mathematicians appear to be less inclined to use the popular concept of inertia as "a tendency to maintain momentum" and instead favor the mathematically useful definition of inertia as the measure of a body's resistance to changes in velocity or simply a body's inertial mass.
This was clear at the beginning of the 20th century, before the advent of the theory of relativity. Mass, m, denoted something like an amount of substance or quantity of matter. At the same time, mass was the quantitative measure of inertia of a body.
The mass of a body determines the momentum,



p


{\displaystyle p}
, of the body at given velocity,



v


{\displaystyle v}
; it is a proportionality factor in the formula:




p
=
m
v


{\displaystyle p=mv}

The factor m is referred to as inertial mass.
But mass, as related to the "inertia" of a body, can also be defined by the formula:




F
=
m
a


{\displaystyle F=ma}

Here, F is force, m is inertial mass, and a is acceleration.
By this formula, the greater its mass, the less a body accelerates under given force. Masses



m


{\displaystyle m}
defined by formula (1) and (2) are equal because formula (2) is a consequence of formula (1) if mass does not depend on time and velocity. Thus, "mass is the quantitative or numerical measure of a bodyâ€™s inertia, that is of its resistance to being accelerated".
This meaning of a body's inertia therefore is altered from the popular meaning as "a tendency to maintain momentum" to a description of the measure of how difficult it is to change the velocity of a body, but it is consistent with the fact that motion in one reference frame can disappear in another, so it is the change in velocity that is important.
