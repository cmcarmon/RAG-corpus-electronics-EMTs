A good example of this is the element carbon, which comprises materials of vastly differing
conductivity: graphite and diamond. Graphite is a fair conductor of electricity, while diamond
is practically an insulator (stranger yet, it is technically classiﬁed as a semiconductor, which
in its pure form acts as an insulator, but can conduct under high temperatures and/or the
inﬂuence of impurities). Both graphite and diamond are composed of the exact same types of
atoms: carbon, with 6 protons, 6 neutrons and 6 electrons each. The fundamental difference
between graphite and diamond being that graphite molecules are ﬂat groupings of carbon
atoms while diamond molecules are tetrahedral (pyramid-shaped) groupings of carbon atoms.
If atoms of carbon are joined to other types of atoms to form compounds, electrical conduc-
tivity becomes altered once again. Silicon carbide, a compound of the elements silicon and car-
bon, exhibits nonlinear behavior: its electrical resistance decreases with increases in applied
voltage! Hydrocarbon compounds (such as the molecules found in oils) tend to be very good
insulators. As you can see, a simple count of valence electrons in an atom is a poor indicator of
a substance’s electrical conductivity.
