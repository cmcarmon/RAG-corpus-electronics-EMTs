Several short sections, as shown in figure 3-15, can be combined to form a large transmission line, as
shown in figure 3-16. Current will flow if voltage is applied across points K and L. In fact, any circuit,
such as that represented in figure 3-16, view A, has a certain current flow for each value of applied
voltage. The ratio of the voltage to the current is the impedance (Z).
