Technological Developments
Computing Hardware
Since  1953,  there  has  been  a  phenomenal  growth  in  the  capabilities  and  power  of  computing  hardware.
Observers  estimate  that  the  power  of  computing  devices  (in  terms  of  both  execution  speed  and  memory
availability) has doubled every second to third year, whereas the size and cost (per computational unit) of the
hardware has halved at approximately the same rate.
