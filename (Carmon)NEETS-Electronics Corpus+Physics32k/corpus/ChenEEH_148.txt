This chapter begins with a few words about history. Before
the second world war, the main communication products were
radios working with amplitude modulation. Stations transmit-
ted on various frequencies, and it was necessary to get only the
desired one and suppress all the others. This led to the devel-
opment of various ﬁlters. Two men contributed fundamentally
to the ﬁlter design theory: Darlington, from the United States,
and Cauer, from Germany.
