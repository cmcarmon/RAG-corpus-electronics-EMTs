Stack and Ash Handling
The stack is designed to disperse gases into the atmosphere without disturbing the environment. This requires
sufﬁcient  stack  height,  which  assists  the  fans  in  removing  gases  from  the  boiler  through  natural  convection.
The gases contain both solid particles and harmful chemicals. Solid particles, like dust, are removed from the
ﬂue gas by electrostatic precipitators or bag-house ﬁlters. Harmful sulfur dioxide is eliminated by scrubbers.
The most common is the lime/limestone scrubbing process.
