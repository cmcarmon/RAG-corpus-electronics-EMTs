Aluminum Terminals and Splicesâ€”Aluminum terminals and splices are noninsulated and very 
difficult to use. Some of the things you should remember when working with aluminum wire are: (1) 
Never attempt to clean the aluminum wire. There is a petroleum abrasive compound in the terminal lug or 
splice that automatically cleans the wire. (2) The only tools that should be used for the crimping operation 
are the power crimping type. (3) Never use lock washers next to aluminum terminal lugs as they will 
gouge out the tinned area and increase deterioration.
