Note the relation of the z-transform to a Laurent’s series.
The DTFT of x[n] is identical to values that the z-transform
assumes on the unit circle (i.e., the circle with unit radius
centered at the origin in the z-plane). With z ¼ rejv viewed
as a position vector, r is the distance from the origin, and v is
the angle between the vector z and the real axis.
