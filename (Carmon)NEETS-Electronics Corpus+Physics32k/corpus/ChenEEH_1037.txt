At the architectural
level, a digital system consists of the
structural view of the data path and a logical view of the
control unit of a circuit. The data path consists of a set of
interconnected functional units (arithmetic, logic, memory,
and registers) and steering units (multiplexers and busses),
while the control unit sends signals to the data path to sched-
ule the appropriate sequence of operations in time.
