In selecting or substituting a capacitor for use, consideration must be given to (1) the value of
capacitance desired and (2) the amount of voltage to be applied across the capacitor. If the voltage applied
across the capacitor is too great, the dielectric will break down and arcing will occur between the capacitor
plates. When this happens the capacitor becomes a short-circuit and the flow of direct current through it can
cause damage to other electronic parts. Each capacitor has a voltage rating (a working voltage) that should
not be exceeded.
