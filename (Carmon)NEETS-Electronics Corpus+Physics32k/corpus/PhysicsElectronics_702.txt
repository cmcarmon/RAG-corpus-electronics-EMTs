The two digital states can be given various names: ON/OFF, true/false, high/low, 1/0, etc..
The 1 and 0 notation naturally leads to the use of binary (base 2) numbers. Octal (base 8)
and hexadecimal (base 16) numbers are also used since they provide a condensed number
notation. Decimal (base 10) numbers are not of much use in digital electronics.
