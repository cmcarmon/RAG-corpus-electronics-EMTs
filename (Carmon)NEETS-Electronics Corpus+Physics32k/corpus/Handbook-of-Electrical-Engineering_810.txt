 the state
can have large variations, and small inputs or small changes in the initial state may produce large variations in
the output. A common example of an unstable system is illustrated by someone pointing the microphone of
a public address (PA) system at a speaker; a loud high-pitched tone results. Often instabilities are caused by
too much gain, so to quiet the PA system, decrease the gain by pointing the microphone away from the speaker.
Discrete systems can also be unstable. A friend of ours once provided an example. She was sitting in a chair
reading and she got cold. So she went over and turned up the thermostat on the heater. The house warmed
up. She got hot, so she got up and turned down the thermostat. The house cooled off. She got cold and turned
up the thermostat. This process continued until someone Ô¨Ånally suggested that she put on a sweater (reducing
the  gain  of  her  heat  loss  system).  She  did,  and  was  much  more  comfortable. We  modeled  this  as  a  discrete
system,  because  she  seemed  to  sample  the  environment  and  produce  outputs  at  discrete  intervals  about  15
minutes apart.
