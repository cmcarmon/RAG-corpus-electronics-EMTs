Valence is an atomâ€™s ability to combine with other atoms. The number of electrons in the outermost
shell of an atom determines its valence. For this reason, the outer shell of an atom is called VALENCE
SHELL, and the electrons contained in this shell are called VALENCE ELECTRONS. The valence of an
atom determines its ability to gain or lose an electron, which in turn determines the chemical and
electrical properties of the atom. An atom that is lacking only one or two electrons from its outer shell
will easily gain electrons to complete its shell, but a large amount of energy is required to free any of its
electrons. An atom having a relatively small number of electrons in its outer shell in comparison to the
number of electrons required to fill the shell will easily lose these valence electrons. The valence shell
always refers to the outermost shell.
