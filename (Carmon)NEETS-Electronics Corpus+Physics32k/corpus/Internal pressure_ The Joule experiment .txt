James Joule tried to measure the internal pressure of air in his expansion experiment by isothermally pumping high pressure air from one metal vessel into another evacuated one. The water bath in which the system was immersed did not change its temperature, signifying that no change in the internal energy occurred, the internal pressure of the air was equal to zero and the air was a perfect gas. The actual deviations from the perfect behaviour were not observed since they are very small and the specific heat capacity of water is relatively high.
