The polarization mismatch factor between the incident wave and the receive antenna, is given by G = 10logr
where 0 £ r £ 1. This factor may be obtained from the voltage axial ratio of the incident wave rw , the voltage
axial ratio of the receive antenna’s polarization response ra , and the difference in tilt angles of the wave and
antenna polarization ellipses Dt = tw – ta , as follows
