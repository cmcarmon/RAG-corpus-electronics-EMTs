Normally, the receiver rotor is unrestrained in movement except for brush and bearing friction. 
When power is first applied to a system, the transmitter position changes quickly; or if the receiver is 
switched into the system, the receiver rotor turns to correspond to the position of the transmitter rotor. 
This sudden motion can cause the rotor to oscillate (swing back and forth) around the synchronous 
position If the movement of the rotor is great enough, it may even spin. Some method of preventing 
oscillations or spinning must be used. Any method that accomplishes this task is termed DAMPING.
