The bi-phase level encoding method records two logic levels for each incoming data bit. When an
incoming data bit is a one, bi-phase level recording records a zero-one. When an incoming data bit is a
zero, bi-phase level recording records a one-zero. This encoding method helps to overcome any
low-frequency response problems that the magnetic tape recorder may have. Figure 7-6 shows how the
digital data word 101000111001 is stored onto magnetic tape using the bi-phase encoding method.
