Frequently domains are far too large for this approach. For example, the symbol table that a compiler of a
programming language maintains is a function from the set of valid identiﬁers to some set of attributes. The
set of valid identiﬁers is inﬁnite, or, if some length limitation is imposed, ﬁnite but exceedingly large (there are
nearly  300  billion  identiﬁers  of  eight  characters  or  less).  For  most  of  its  domain  a  symbol  table  returns  the
default value new or not found. It is therefore economical to store the mapping only for those domain values
that map to a value different from the default value. A function of this sort is usually speciﬁed as follows:
