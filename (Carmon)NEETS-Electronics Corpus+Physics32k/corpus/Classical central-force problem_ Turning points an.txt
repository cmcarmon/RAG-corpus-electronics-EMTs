The points where this equation is satisfied are known as turning points. The orbit on either side of a turning point is symmetrical; in other words, if the azimuthal angle is defined such that φ = 0 at the turning point, then the orbit is the same in opposite directions, r(φ) = r(−φ).
If there are two turning points such that the radius r is bounded between rmin and rmax, then the motion is contained within an annulus of those radii. As the radius varies from the one turning point to the other, the change in azimuthal angle φ equals

{\displaystyle \Delta \varphi =2\pi {\frac {m}{n}}}

where m and n are integers. In that case, the radius oscillates exactly m times while the azimuthal angle φ makes exactly n revolutions. In general, however, Δφ will not be such a rational number, and thus the orbit will not be closed. In that case, the particle will eventually pass arbitrarily close to every point within the annulus. Two types of central force always produce closed orbits: F(r) = αr (a linear force) and F(r) = α/r2 (an inverse square law). As shown by Bertrand, these two central forces are the only ones that guarantee closed orbits.
In general, if the angular momentum L is nonzero, the second term prevents the particle from falling into the origin, unless the effective potential energy goes to negative infinity in the limit of r going to zero. Therefore, if there is a single turning point, the orbit generally goes to infinity; the turning point corresponds to a point of minimum radius.
