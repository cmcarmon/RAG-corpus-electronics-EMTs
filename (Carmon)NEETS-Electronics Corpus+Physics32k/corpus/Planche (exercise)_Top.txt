A planche is a skill in gymnastics in which the body is held parallel to the ground, giving the illusion of floating. It is a move that requires significant strength and balance.
There are many variations of a planche, although only two are accredited in artistic gymnastics: the straddle planche, and the straight legged planche. Somewhat less well known is the double planar planche. Depending on the event, it can range from a B to a D skill, and must be held for at least two seconds. This move is also done commonly in break dancing (known as a no-legged or planche pushup). The muscles used in this exercise are the chest, shoulders, upper back, lower back, and glutes.
As the planche is a demanding position, athletes train for it with a progression of simpler moves, advancing to the next (and finally the planche) when they have gained mastery of the intermediate positions. A typical training progression is usually frog stand, advanced frog stand, tuck planche, advanced tuck planche, straddle planche, and then full planche. The arms should be locked at all times in all positions, except frog stand.
