Circuits are sets of lumped elements connected by ideal wires. A node is formed
at the junction point at which the terminals of two or more elements are con-
nected. We choose the wires such that they obey the lumped matter discipline,
so the wires themselves are also lumped elements. For their voltages and cur-
rents to be meaningful, the constraints that apply to lumped elements apply to
entire circuits as well. In other words, for voltages between any pair of points
in the circuit and for currents through wires to be defined, any segment of the
circuit must obey a set of constraints similar to those imposed on each of the
lumped elements.
