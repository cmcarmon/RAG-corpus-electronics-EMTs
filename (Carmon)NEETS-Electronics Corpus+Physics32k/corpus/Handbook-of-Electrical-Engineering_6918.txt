Power spectral density: The Fourier transform of the power  X2(t) does not necessarily exist, but it does for
2 (t)/2T (XT (t) = 0 for *t* > T, = X(t) elsewhere), for any T > 0. Letting Tﬁ¥, the expected value of
X T
2 (t)]/2T  goes  to  the  limit  of  the  average  power  in  X(t)
the  Fourier  transforms  E[F[XT
over – T to  T, known as the power spectral density function Sxx (w). Summed up over all frequencies, it
gives the total power in the signal X(t).
