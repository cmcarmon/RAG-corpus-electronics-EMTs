The idea is simple. A magnetic field in a stator can be made to rotate electrically, around and around.
Another magnetic field in the rotor can be made to chase it by being attracted and repelled by the stator
field. Because the rotor is free to turn, it follows the rotating magnetic field in the stator. Letâ€™s see how it
is done.
