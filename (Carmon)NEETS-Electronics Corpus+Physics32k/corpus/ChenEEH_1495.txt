Level 7 implements a virtual memory, a scheme that gives the
programmer the illusion of having a main memory space large

available real memory is much smaller (Denning, 1970). Soft-
ware at this level handles the interrupts generated by the hard-
ware when a block of data is addressed that is not in the main
memory; this software locates the missing block in the second-
ary storage, frees space for it in the main storage, and requests
