In addition to m.w.e., underground laboratory depth can also be measured in meters of standard rock. Standard rock is defined to have mass number A = 22, atomic number Z = 11, and density 2.65 g/cm3. Because most laboratories are under earth and not underwater, the depth in standard rock is often closer to the actual underground depth of the laboratory.
