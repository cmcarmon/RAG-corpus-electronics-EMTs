Operational amplifiers can have either a closed-loop operation or an open-loop operation. The
operation (closed-loop or open-loop) is determined by whether or not feedback is used. Without feedback
the operational amplifier has an open-loop operation. This open-loop operation is practical only when the
operational amplifier is used as a comparator (a circuit which compares two input signals or compares an
input signal to some fixed level of voltage). As an amplifier, the open-loop operation is not practical
because the very high gain of the operational amplifier creates poor stability. (Noise and other unwanted
signals are amplified so much in open-loop operation that the operational amplifier is usually not used in
this way.) Therefore, most operational amplifiers are used with feedback (closed-loop operation).
