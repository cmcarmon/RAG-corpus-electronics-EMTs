With the growing ubiquity and portability of multimedia-
enabled devices, universal multimedia access (UMA) is
emerging as one of the important applications for the next
generation of multimedia systems (Smith, 2000). The basic
concept of UMA is the adaptation, summarization, and per-
sonalization of multimedia content according to usage envi-
ronment. The different dimensions for adaptation include rate
and quality reduction (Kuhn et al., 2001), adaptive spatial and
temporal sampling (Smith, 1999), and semantic summariza-
tion of the multimedia content (Tseng et al., 2002). The differ-
ent relevant dimensions of the user environment include
device capabilities, bandwidth, user preferences, usage context,
and spatial and temporal awareness.
