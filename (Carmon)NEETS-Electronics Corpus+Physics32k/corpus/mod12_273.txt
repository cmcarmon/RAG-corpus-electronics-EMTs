Views (A) and (B) of figure 2-9 show the frequency spectrum for various fm signals. In the four
examples of view (A), the modulating frequency is constant; the deviation frequency is changed to show
the effects of modulation indexes of 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, and 10.0. In view (B) the deviation frequency is held
constant and the modulating frequency is varied to give the same modulation indexes.
