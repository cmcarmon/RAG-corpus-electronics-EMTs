Pixel addressing is achieved through a partial discharge by introducing an address pulse timed between the
sustain  pulses.  A  write  pulse  causes  the  wall  voltage  to  transit  from  zero  volts  to  the  Ô¨Ånal  equilibrium  wall
voltage level. Likewise, an erase pulse causes the wall voltage to return to zero.
