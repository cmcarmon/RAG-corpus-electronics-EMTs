The identifying characteristics of the Armstrong oscillator are that (1) it uses an LC tuned circuit to 
establish the frequency of oscillation, (2) feedback is accomplished by mutual inductive coupling between 
the tickler coil and the LC tuned circuit, and (3) it uses a class C amplifier with self-bias. Its frequency is 
fairly stable, and the output amplitude is relatively constant.
