generated  externally  or  by  using  an  on-chip  pattern  generator,  and  the  Ô¨Ånal  test  signature  (i.e.,  contents  of
MISR)  can  be  accessed  using  dedicated  test  pins,  such  as  by  providing  an  IEEE  1149.1  TAP  (see  previous
subsection). Figure 85.19 shows how the CrossCheck technique is implemented on an ASIC.
