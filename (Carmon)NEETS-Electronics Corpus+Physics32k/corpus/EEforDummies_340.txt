exhibit a constant resistance under all circum-
stances. For such components, the opposition 
to current — known as impedance — will vary 
depending on what’s going on in the circuit. So 
you can’t just use a multimeter to measure the 
“resistance” of a capacitor, for instance, and 
then try to apply Ohm’s Law willy‐nilly.
