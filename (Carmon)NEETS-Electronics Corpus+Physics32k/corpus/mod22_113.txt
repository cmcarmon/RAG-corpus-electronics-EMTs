HEAT AND SUNLIGHT.â€”Never expose disks to excessive heat or direct sunlight. Either can 
cause the disks to become warped or distorted so they cannot be used. Disks are made of a plastic 
material, and if you have ever seen a phonograph record that has been exposed to heat or sunlight, you 
have some idea of the damage that can result from exposure. Typically, disks will operate only between 
10 and 50 degrees Celsius (50 to 120 degrees Fahrenheit). They will accept a relative humidity of 10% to 
80%.
