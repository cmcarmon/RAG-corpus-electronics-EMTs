These  higher  levels  of  abstraction  support  a  more  expressive, “higher-bandwidth”  communication  interface
between  engineers  and  DA  programs.  Engineers  can  focus  their  creative,  cognitive  skills  on  concept  and
behavior,  rather  than  on  the  complexities  of  detailed  implementation.  Associated  design  entry  mechanisms
typically use hardware description languages with a combination of textual and graphic techniques [Birtwistle
and Subrahmanyan, 1988].
 Figure 34.7 shows an example of a simple state diagram. The state diagram deﬁnes three states, denoted by
circles. State-to-state transitions are denoted by labeled arcs; state transitions depend on the present state and
the  input  X.  The  output,  Z,  per  state  is  given  within  each  state.  Since  the  output  is  dependent  on  only  the
. If the output is dependent on the
present state, the digital system is classiﬁed as a Moore 
present state and input, then the digital system is classiﬁed as a Mealy ﬁnite state machine.
