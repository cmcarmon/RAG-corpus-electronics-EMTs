Fiber optic transmitters come in various sizes and shapes. The least complex fiber optic transmitters
are typically packaged in transistor outline (TO) cans or hybrid microcircuit modules in dual inline
packages (DIPs). These simple transmitters may require separate circuitry in the system equipment to
provide an acceptable input signal to the transmitter. More complex fiber optic transmitters are available
that have some or all of the signal conditioning circuitry integrated into the package. These transmitters
typically are packaged in hybrid microcircuit modules in either DIP or butterfly lead packages, circuit
cards, or complete stand-alone fiber optic converters. Stand-alone fiber optic converters and circuit cards
generally contain sources in either TO cans or one of the hybrid microcircuit packages. For commercial
applications, the most popular transmitter packages are the TO can and the DIP hybrid microcircuit.
