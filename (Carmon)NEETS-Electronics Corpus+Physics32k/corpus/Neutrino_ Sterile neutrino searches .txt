Other efforts search for evidence of a sterile neutrino â€“ a fourth neutrino flavor that does not interact with matter like the three known neutrino flavors. The possibility of sterile neutrinos is unaffected by the Z-boson decay measurements described above: If their mass is greater than half the Z-boson's mass, they would not be a decay product. Therefore, heavy sterile neutrinos would have a mass of at least 45.6 GeV.
The existence of such particles is in fact hinted by experimental data from the LSND experiment. On the other hand, the currently running MiniBooNE experiment suggested that sterile neutrinos are not required to explain the experimental data, although the latest research into this area is on-going and anomalies in the MiniBooNE data may allow for exotic neutrino types, including sterile neutrinos. A recent re-analysis of reference electron spectra data from the Institut Laue-Langevin has also hinted at a fourth, sterile neutrino.
According to an analysis published in 2010, data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe of the cosmic background radiation is compatible with either three or four types of neutrinos.
