This difference in calculation has a profound impact on the qualitative analysis of transient
circuit response. Resistor-capacitor circuits respond quicker with low resistance and slower
with high resistance; resistor-inductor circuits are just the opposite, responding quicker with
high resistance and slower with low resistance. While capacitive circuits seem to present no
intuitive trouble for the new student, inductive circuits tend to make less sense.
