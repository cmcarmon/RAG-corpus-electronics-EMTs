where K is the variable gain parameter. The root loci for a digital control system are constructed in the complex
z plane. All the properties of the root loci in the  s plane apply readily to the z plane, with the exception that
the stability boundary is now the unit circle *z * = 1. That is, the system is stable if all the characteristic equation
roots lie inside the unit circle.
