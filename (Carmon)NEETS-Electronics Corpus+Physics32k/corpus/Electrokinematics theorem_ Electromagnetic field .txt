The shown electrokinetics theorem holds true in the 'quasi electrostatic' condition, that is when the vector potential can be neglected or, in other terms, when the squared maximum size of



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }
is much smaller than the squared minimum wavelength of the electromagnetic field in the device. However it can be extended to the electromagnetic field in a general form. In this general case, by means of the displacement current across the surface




S

R




{\displaystyle S_{R}}
it is possible, for instance, to evaluate the electromagnetic field radiation from an antenna. It holds true also when the electric permittivity and the magnetic permeability depend on the frequency. Moreover, the field

∇
Φ


{\displaystyle F(r,t)=-\nabla \Phi }
other than the electric field in 'quasi electrostatic' conditions, can be any other physical irrotational field.
