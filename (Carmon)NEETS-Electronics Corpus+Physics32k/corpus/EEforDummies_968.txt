Although not all electronics circuits you encounter 
are described in the form of a schematic, many are. 
If you’re serious at all about studying electronics, 
(sooner or later) you need to understand how to 
read a schematic. Not to worry! The language of 
schematics isn’t all that hard to learn. Most sche-
matic diagrams use only a handful of symbols for 
components, such as resistors, capacitors, and 
 transistors.
