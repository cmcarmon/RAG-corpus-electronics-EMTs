can be used to replace a loudspeaker when an audio 
amplifier is being tested). 
  The  specifications  for  a  resistor  usually  include 
the  value  of  resistance  expressed  in  ohms  ($), 
kilohms  (k$) or  megohms  (M$),  the  accuracy  or 
tolerance  (quoted  as  the  maximum  permissible 
percentage  deviation  from  the  marked  value),  and 
the power rating (which must be equal to, or greater 
than, the maximum expected power dissipation). 
  Other  practical  considerations  when  selecting 
resistors for use in a particular application include 
temperature 
coefficient,  noise  performance, 
stability and ambient temperature range. Table 2.1 
summarizes  the  properties  of  five  of  the  most 
common  types  of  resistor.  Figure  2.2  shows  a 
typical selection of fixed resistors with values from 
15 $ to 4.7 k$.
