Any two-level quantum system can form a qubit, and there are two ways to form a qubit using the electronic states of an ion:
Two ground state hyperfine levels (these are called "hyperfine qubits")
A ground state level and an excited level (these are called the "optical qubits")
Hyperfine qubits are extremely long-lived (decay time of the order of thousands to millions of years) and phase/frequency stable (traditionally used for atomic frequency standards). Optical qubits are also relatively long-lived (with a decay time of the order of a second), compared to the logic gate operation time (which is of the order of microseconds). The use of each type of qubit poses its own distinct challenges in the laboratory.
