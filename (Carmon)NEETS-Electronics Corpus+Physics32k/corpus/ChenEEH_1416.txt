Haug and Rosenstiel (1998) have integrated run-time man-
agement techniques into the Linux operating system. Their
tools synthesize hardware from user-deﬁned threads in a C
program. The operating system’s scheduler has been modiﬁed
to keep track of the conﬁgurations in use by the FPGA copro-
cessor. By incorporating their scheduler into a popular operat-
ing system such as Linux, they are one step closer to making
run-time reconﬁguration a mainstream technology.
