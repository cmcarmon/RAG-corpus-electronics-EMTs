Generally, the study of LAN performance made by the IEEE
802 Committee suggests that smaller frame sizes have greater
differences in the throughput between token passing and
CSMA/CD. CSMA/CD strongly depends on the value of a.
Token ring is the least sensitive to the workload. CSMA/CD
has the shortest delay under the light load and is most sensitive
to the heavy load.
