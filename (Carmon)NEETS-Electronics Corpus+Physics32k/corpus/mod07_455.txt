The choke (L1) is usually a large value, from 1 to 20 henries, and offers a large inductive reactance 
to the 120-hertz ripple component produced by the rectifier. Therefore, the effect that L1 has on the 
charging of the capacitor (C1) must be considered. Since L1 is connected in series with the parallel 
branch consisting of C1 and RL, a division of the ripple (ac) voltage and the output (dc) voltage occurs. 
The greater the impedance of the choke, the less the ripple voltage that appears across C1 and the output. 
The dc output voltage is fixed mainly by the dc resistance of the choke.
