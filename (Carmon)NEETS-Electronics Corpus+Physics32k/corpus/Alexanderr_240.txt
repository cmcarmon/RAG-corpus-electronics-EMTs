The  equivalent  circuit  model  of  an  op  amp  is  shown  in  Fig.  5.4.
The output section consists of a voltage-controlled source in series with
the output resistance Ro. It is evident from Fig. 5.4 that the input resis-
tance Ri is the Thevenin equivalent resistance seen at the input termi-
nals, while the output resistance Ro is the Thevenin equivalent resistance
seen at the output. The differential input voltage vd is given by
