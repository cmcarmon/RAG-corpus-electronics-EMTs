The Big Lurch is a theoretical scientific model suggested as one of the possibilities for ultimate fate of the universe. Matter works itself up into a frenzy and forces governing the universe grow infinitely, building up infinite pressure while the density and cosmic expansion rate remain in steady state. The consequences for time are unclear in this scenario. According to astronomical calculations, there is a finite probability of this scenario actually happening relatively soon, in as little as a few million years.
