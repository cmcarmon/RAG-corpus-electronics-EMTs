How much screen time a child receives may depend on socioeconomic status and race. Too much screen time can affect a child's health. Research in the United States states that African-American (69%) and Hispanic (68%) children have rates of a television in the bedroom that are twice as high compared to white children (28%). Children consume an extra 167 calories per day for every hour of television viewing. TV viewing also causes an increase in fast food consumption and more time spent playing video game is linked to an increase in weight in children.
The study of increased screen time in children is fairly new and researchers have not been able to observe effects long enough to make a solid conclusion on potential negative consequences as children age.
