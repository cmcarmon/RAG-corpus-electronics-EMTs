The architecture of a conﬁgurable cell, either ﬁne-grained or
coarse-grained, is mainly driven by either general-purpose or
signal/image processing computing. Its conﬁguration or con-
text can be stored locally like SRAM-based FPGA. Instead of
being off-chip and loosely coupled to the host processor, RC is
going toward an on-chip coprocessor as the technology ad-
vances to SOC.
