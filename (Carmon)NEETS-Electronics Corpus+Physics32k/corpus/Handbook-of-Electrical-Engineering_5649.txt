1. Power-ﬂow programs. Power-ﬂow (also called load-ﬂow) programs compute voltage magnitudes, phase
angles,  and  transmission  line  power  ﬂows  for  a  power  system  network  under  steady-state  operating
conditions.  Other  output  results,  including  transformer  tap  settings,  equipment  losses,  and  reactive
power outputs of generators and other devices, are also computed. To do this, the locations, sizes, and
operating characteristics of all loads and generation resources of the system are speciﬁed as inputs. Other
inputs  include  the  network  conﬁguration  as  well  as  ratings  and  other  characteristics  of  transmission
lines, transformers, and other equipment. Today’s computers have sufﬁcient storage and speed to com-
pute in less than 1 min power-ﬂow solutions for networks with more than 2000 buses and 2500 trans-
mission lines. High-speed printers then print out the complete solution in tabular form for analysis by
the planning engineer. Also available are interactive power-ﬂow programs, whereby power-ﬂow results
are displayed on computer screens in the form of single-line diagrams; the engineer uses these to modify
the network from a keyboard or with a mouse and can readily visualize the results. Spreadsheet analyses
are  also  used.  The  computer’s  large  storage  and  high-speed  capabilities  allow  the  engineer  to  run  the
many different cases necessary for planning.
