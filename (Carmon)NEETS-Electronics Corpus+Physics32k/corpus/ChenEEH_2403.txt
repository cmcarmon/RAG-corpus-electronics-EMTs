It may be noted that Figure 6.5 shows only an example case.
Depending on the type of the antenna and its application, the
resonance frequency and bandwidth may be deﬁned based on
the performance parameter one desires for the particular appli-
cation, such as the gain, directivity, axial ratio. In such cases, the
resonant frequency is deﬁned as the frequency of best perfor-
mance and the bandwidth as the frequency span over which the
performance can be tolerated, as dictated by the application. It
is meaningful to call the resonant frequency and the bandwidth
of an antenna with an appropriate parameter preﬁx, such as the
the impedance–bandwidth,
impedance–resonant
gain–resonant
the axial–
axial–ratio–bandwidth.
ratio–resonant
Often, the deﬁnitions based on the different performance par-
ameters have strong correlations with each other.
