A common procedure to examine solutions of Eq. (100.120) is to use a Nyquist diagram, where the G(jw)
and C(a) = –1/N(a) loci are plotted as in Fig. 100.46, where they are shown intersecting for a = a0 and w = w
0.
The DF method indicates therefore that the system has a limit cycle with the input sinusoid to the nonlinearity,
x, equal to a0 sin (w
0t + f), where f depends on the initial conditions. When the G(jw) and C(a) loci do not
intersect, the DF method predicts that no limit cycle will exist if the Nyquist stability criterion is satisﬁed for
G(jw) with respect to any point on the C(a) locus. Obviously, if the nonlinearity has unit gain for small inputs,
the point (–1, j0) will lie on C(a) and may be used as the critical point, analogous to a linear system.
