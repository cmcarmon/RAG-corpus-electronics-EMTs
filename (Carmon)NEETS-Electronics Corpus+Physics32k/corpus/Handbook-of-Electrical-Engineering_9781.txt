Classes of Systems to Be Modeled
Most  control  problems  are  multidisciplinary.  The  system  may  consist  of  electrical,  mechanical,  thermal,  optical,
ï¬‚uidic, or other physical components, as well as economic, biological, or ecological systems. Analogies exist between
these various disciplines, based upon the similarity of the equations that describe the phenomena. The discussion
of models in this section will be given in mathematical terms and therefore will apply to several disciplines.
