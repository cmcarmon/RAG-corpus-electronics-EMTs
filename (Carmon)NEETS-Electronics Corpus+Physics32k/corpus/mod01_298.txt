ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION GENERATOR To produce voltage by use of magnetism,
three conditions must be met: There must be a CONDUCTOR in which the voltage will be produced;
there must be a MAGNETIC FIELD in the conductorâ€™s vicinity; and there must be relative motion
between the field and conductor. When these conditions are met, electrons WITHIN THE CONDUCTOR
are propelled in one direction or another, creating an electromotive force, or voltage.
