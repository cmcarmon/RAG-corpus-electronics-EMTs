A simpliﬁed schematic diagram of the electric circuit of an electronic photo ﬂash typically used
on cameras is shown in Figure 7.7.1. By passing a high current through the ﬂash tube, a bright
ﬂash of light is to be produced while the camera shutter is open. The power level is quite high,
as much as 1 kW. The total energy delivered, however, is only on the order of 1 j, since the ﬂash
lasts less than 1 ms.
