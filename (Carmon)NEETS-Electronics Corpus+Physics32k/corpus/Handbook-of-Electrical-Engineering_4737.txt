The basic geometry of Fig. 48.4(c) gives an electric-to-electric delay line whose delay is given by the length
of the medium between the transducers divided by the phase velocity of the acoustic wave and would be on
the order of 2 ms/cm. Since the solid has little dispersion, the bandwidth of the delay line is determined by that
of the transducers. Here it is necessary to choose the characteristic impedances and thicknesses of the backing
and matching layers in Fig. 48.2 in such a manner that the conversion of the electrical energy incident on the
electrical port to the acoustic energy out of acoustic port 2 of Fig. 48.3 is independent of frequency over a large
range about the resonant frequency of the piezoelectric transducer itself. Varying the matching and backing
layers is equivalent to varying the terminating impedances on the acoustic line of Fig. 48.3. The matching is
often assisted by lumped elements in the external electrical circuit.
