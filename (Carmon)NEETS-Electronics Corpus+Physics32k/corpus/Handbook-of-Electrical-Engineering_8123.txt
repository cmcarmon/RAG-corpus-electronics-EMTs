The principle of the twisted nematic cell is illustrated in Fig. 83.14. The conﬁning plates, typically 10 mm
apart, are grooved orthogonally, forcing the molecular orientation to spiral through 90 degrees [Fig. 83.14(a)].
In the LCD, two polarizers and a mirror are added as shown in Fig. 83.14(b). Incident ambient light is polarized
and  enters  the  liquid-crystal  cell  with  the  plane  of  polarization  parallel  to  the  molecular  orientation. As  the
light traverses the cell, the plane of polarization is rotated by the twist in the liquid crystal, so that it reaches
the opposite face with a polarization 90 degrees to the original direction, but parallel now to the direction of
the second polarizer, through which it may therefore pass. The light is then reﬂected from the mirror and passes
back through the cell, reversing the prior sequence.
