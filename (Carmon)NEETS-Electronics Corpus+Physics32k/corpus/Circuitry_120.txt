 
Inductance and physical dimensions 
 
The  inductance  of  an  inductor  depends  upon  the 
physical dimensions of the inductor (e.g. the length 
and diameter of the winding), the number of turns, 
and  the  permeability  of  the  material  of  the  core.    
The inductance of an inductor is given by:
