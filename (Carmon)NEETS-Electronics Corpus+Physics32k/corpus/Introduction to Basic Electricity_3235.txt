After	completing	this	chapter,	the	student	will	be	
able	to:
Describe	the	differences	among	transistors,	
JFETs,	and	MOSFETs.
Draw	schematic	symbols	for	both	P-channel	
and	N-channel	JFETs,	depletion	MOSFETs,	and	
enhancement	MOSFETs.
Describe	how	a	JFET,	a	depletion	MOSFET,	and	
an	enhancement	MOSFET	operate.
Identify	the	parts	of	JFETs	and	MOSFETs.
Describe	the	safety	precautions	that	must	be	
observed	when	handling	MOSFETs.
Describe	the	procedure	for	testing	JFETs	and	
MOSFETs	with	an	ohmmeter.
