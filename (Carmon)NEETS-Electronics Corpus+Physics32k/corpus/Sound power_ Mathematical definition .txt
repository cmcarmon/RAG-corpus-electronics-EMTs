Sound power, denoted P, is defined by




P
=

f

⋅

v

=
A
p


u

⋅

v

=
A
p
v


{\displaystyle P=\mathbf {f} \cdot \mathbf {v} =Ap\,\mathbf {u} \cdot \mathbf {v} =Apv}

where
f is the sound force of unit vector u;
v is the particle velocity of projection v along u;
A is the area;
p is the sound pressure.
In a medium, the sound power is given by




P
=



A

p

ρ

θ
,


{\displaystyle P={\frac {Ap^{2}}{\rho c}}\cos \theta ,}

where
A is the area of the surface;
ρ is the mass density;
c is the sound velocity;
θ is the angle between the direction of propagation of the sound and the normal to the surface.
For example, a sound at SPL = 85 dB or p = 0.356 Pa in air (ρ = 1.2 kg·m−3 and c = 343 m·s−1) through a surface of area A = 1 m2 normal to the direction of propagation (θ = 0 °) has a sound energy flux P = 0.3 mW.
This is the parameter one would be interested in when converting noise back into usable energy, along with any losses in the capturing device.
