By the method of superposition, the voltage v0 can be determined by summing the
responses of each of the sources acting alone. We will first obtain v05, the response
of the 5-V source acting alone. The subcircuit corresponding to the 5-V source acting
alone is shown in Figure 3.37. Notice we have shorted the 6 V source.
