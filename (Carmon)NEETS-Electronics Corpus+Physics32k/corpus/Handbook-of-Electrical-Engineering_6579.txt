The system in Table 71.2 runs at 500 Mbps with NRZ coding
for a 100-km length of ﬁber. Equation (71.18) yields a required
system  rise  time  no  more  than  1.4  ns.  The  transmitter  is
assumed to have a rise time of 0.8 ns. The receiver rise time,
taken as 1 ns in the table, is a combination of the photodetec-
tor’s rise time and that of the receiver’s electronics.
