Another way to measure current that does not re-
quire opening the circuit and placing an ammeter 
in series is to use a resistor of a known value in the 
circuit. The resistor is referred to as an ammeter	
shunt and may be installed by the manufacturer or 
inserted for temporary use. The resistor may be left in 
for future testing of the circuit and must be of a small 
enough value to not interfere with the normal opera-
tion of the circuit.
