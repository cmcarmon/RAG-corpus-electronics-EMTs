Consider the NAND gate in Figure 6.42. Assume the following values for the circuit
parameters: VS = 5 V, VT = 1 V, and RL = 10 k. Assume, further, that Rn = 5 k
for each of the MOSFETs. Determine a W/L sizing for the MOSFETs so that the
NAND gate output is able to switch ON or OFF the MOSFET of another gate such as
an inverter.
