FIGURE 71.1 Bandwidth versus carrier-to-noise ratio
(CNR)  required  for  AM-VSB,  FM,  and  digital  video.
Increasingly  complex  digital  compression  techniques
reduce  the  bit  rate  required  for  NTSC-like  video  from
100 Mbps to less than 5 Mbps. Bandwidth efÔ¨Åcient RF
techniques like QAM minimize the bandwidth required
for each bit rate but require greater CNRs.
