A fluid power system has a pump driven by a prime mover (such as an electric motor or internal combustion engine) that converts mechanical energy into fluid energy, Pressurized fluid is controlled and directed by valves into an actuator device such as a hydraulic cylinder or pneumatic cylinder, to provide linear motion, or a hydraulic motor or pneumatic motor, to provide rotary motion or torque. Rotary motion may be continuous or confined to less than one revolution.
