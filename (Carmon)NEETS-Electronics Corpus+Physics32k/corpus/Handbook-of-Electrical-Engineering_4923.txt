The unusual properties of this phase slippage were ﬁrst investigated by Brian Josephson and constitute the
central principles behind superconducting electronics. Josephson found that the phase slippage could be deﬁned
as the difference between the macroscopic phases on either side of the weak link. This phase difference, denoted
as f, determined the supercurrent, is, through and voltage, v, across the weak link according to the Josephson
equations,
