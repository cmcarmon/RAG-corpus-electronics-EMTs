“I am a United States Sailor. 
 
I will support and defend the 
Constitution of the United States of 
America and I will obey the orders 
of those appointed over me. 
 
I represent the fighting spirit of the 
Navy and those who have gone 
before me to defend freedom and 
democracy around the world. 
 
I proudly serve my country’s Navy 
combat team with honor, courage 
and commitment. 
 
I am committed to excellence and 
the fair treatment of all.”
