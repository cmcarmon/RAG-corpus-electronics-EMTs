In a conventional digital modulation scheme, the modulator represents each symbol to be transmitted as a
weighted sum of a number of periodic basis functions. For example, two orthogonal signals, such as a sine and
a cosine, can be used. Each symbol represents a certain bit sequence and is mapped to a corresponding set of
weights. The objective of the receiver is to recover the weights associated with the received signal and thereby
