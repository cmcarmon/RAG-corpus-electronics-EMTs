For a massive object moving at three-velocity u = (ux, uy, uz) with magnitude |u| = u in the lab frame:




E
=

γ

(

u

)



m

0



c

2




{\displaystyle E=\gamma _{(\mathbf {u} )}m_{0}c^{2}}

is the total energy of the moving object in the lab frame,





p

=

γ

(

u

)



m

0



u



{\displaystyle \mathbf {p} =\gamma _{(\mathbf {u} )}m_{0}\mathbf {u} }

is the three dimensional relativistic momentum of the object in the lab frame with magnitude |p| = p. The relativistic energy E and momentum p include the Lorentz factor defined by:

{\displaystyle \gamma _{(\mathbf {u} )}={\frac {1}{\sqrt {1-{\frac {\mathbf {u} \cdot \mathbf {u} }{c^{2}}}}}}={\frac {1}{\sqrt {1-\left({\frac {u}{c}}\right)^{2}}}}}

Some authors use relativistic mass defined by:




m
=

γ

(

u

)



m

0




{\displaystyle m=\gamma _{(\mathbf {u} )}m_{0}}

although rest mass m0 has a more fundamental significance, and will be used primarily over relativistic mass m in this article.
Squaring the 3-momentum gives:

{\displaystyle p^{2}=\mathbf {p} \cdot \mathbf {p} ={\frac {m_{0}^{2}\mathbf {u} \cdot \mathbf {u} }{1-{\frac {\mathbf {u} \cdot \mathbf {u} }{c^{2}}}}}={\frac {m_{0}^{2}u^{2}}{1-\left({\frac {u}{c}}\right)^{2}}}}

then solving for u2 and substituting into the Lorentz factor obtains its alternative form in terms of 3-momentum and mass, rather than 3-velocity:




γ
=


1

(


p


m

c



)

{\displaystyle \gamma ={\sqrt {1+\left({\frac {p}{m_{0}c}}\right)^{2}}}}

Inserting this form of the Lorentz factor into the energy equation:




E

m

0



c

(


p

)


2






{\displaystyle E=m_{0}c^{2}{\sqrt {1+\left({\frac {p}{m_{0}c}}\right)^{2}}}}

followed by more rearrangement yields (1). The elimination of the Lorentz factor also eliminates implicit velocity dependence of the particle in (1), as well as any inferences to the "relativistic mass" of a massive particle. This approach is not general as massless particles are not considered. Naively setting m0 = 0 would mean that E = 0 and p = 0 and no energy–momentum relation could be derived, which is not correct.
