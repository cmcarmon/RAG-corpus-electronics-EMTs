MBE
The MBE coder [Hardwick and Lim, 1991] is an efﬁcient frequency-domain architecture partially based on the
concepts  of  sinusoidal  transform  coding  (STC)  [McAulay  and  Quatieri,  1986].  In  MBE,  the  instantaneous
spectral envelope is represented explicitly by harmonic estimates in several subbands. The performance of MBE
coders at rates below 4 kbps is generally “better” than that of CELP-based schemes.
