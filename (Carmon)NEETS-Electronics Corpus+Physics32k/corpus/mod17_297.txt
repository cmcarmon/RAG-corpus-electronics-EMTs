A transmitter transfer switchboard provides the capability to transfer remote control station functions 
and signals to transmitters. Figure 3-3 is a representative transfer switchboard that provides the capability 
for selectively transferring any one, or all, of ten remote control station functions and signals to any one 
of six transmitters. The cabinet has ten rotary switches arranged in two vertical rows of five each. Each 
switch has eight positions. The circuitry is arranged so that you cannot parallel transmitter control 
circuits; that is, you cannot connect more than one transmitter to any remote control location.
