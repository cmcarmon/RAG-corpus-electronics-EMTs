When dealing with small signals, other criteria are often more important in
selecting the operating point than just obtaining maximum dynamic range. One
criterion is the small-signal gain of the amplifier. As evident from Equation 8.28,
the small-signal gain of the amplifier is dependent on the input operating point
voltage VI. The magnitude of the small-signal gain is given by
