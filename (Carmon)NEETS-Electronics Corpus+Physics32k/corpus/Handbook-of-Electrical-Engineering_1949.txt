As indicated before, a special case of folding can address systolic array design for regular data ﬂow graphs
and for linear mappings. The systolic architectures make use of extensive pipelining and local communication
and operate in a synchronous manner [Kung, 1988]. The systolic processors can also be made to operate in an
asynchronous  manner,  and  such  systems  are  often  referred  to  as  wavefront  processors.  Systolic  architectures
have been designed for a variety of applications including convolution, matrix solvers, matrix decomposition,
and ﬁltering.
