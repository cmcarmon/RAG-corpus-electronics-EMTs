View B shows how two waves of the same frequency and amplitude moving in opposite directions
on the same conductor will combine to form a resultant wave. The small solid line is moving steadily
from left to right and is the INCIDENT WAVE (from the source). The broken-line waveform is moving
from right to left and is the REFLECTED WAVE. The resultant waveform, the heavy line, is found by
algebraically adding instantaneous values of the two waveforms. The resultant waveform has an
