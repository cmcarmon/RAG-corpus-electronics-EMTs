A more circuits-oriented approach to modeling op amps can be obtained if the input transistors are removed
and a model formed by using passive components along with both Ô¨Åxed and dependent voltage and current
sources. Such a model is shown in Fig. 27.5. This model not only includes all the basic nonideal effects of the
op  amp,  allowing  for  multiple  poles  and  zeroes,  but  can  also  accurately  include  ENV  and  ENI  noise  effects.
