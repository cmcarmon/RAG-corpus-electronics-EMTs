Single mode fibers have a lower signal loss and a higher information capacity (bandwidth) than
multimode fibers. Single mode fibers are capable of transferring higher amounts of data due to low fiber
dispersion. Basically, dispersion is the spreading of light as light propagates along a fiber. Dispersion
mechanisms in single mode fibers are discussed in more detail later in this chapter. Signal loss depends
on the operational wavelength (Ã¿). In single mode fibers, the wavelength can increase or decrease the
losses caused by fiber bending. Single mode fibers operating at wavelengths larger than the cutoff
wavelength lose more power at fiber bends. They lose power because light radiates into the cladding,
which is lost at fiber bends. In general, single mode fibers are considered to be low-loss fibers, which
increase system bandwidth and length.
