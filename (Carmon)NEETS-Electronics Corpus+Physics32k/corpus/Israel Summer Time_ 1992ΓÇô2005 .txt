The Law Determining the Time (Hebrew: חוק קביעת הזמן‎ Hok Kvi'at Hazman) is an Israel law governing Israeli daylight saving time. It was approved by the Knesset in 1992, replacing the British Mandate of Palestine time act inherited by Israel. The 1992 time zone law cancelled the Time Act, and stipulated that IDT will be operated for at least 150 days each year, and that the final dates will be decided by the minister of the Interior, subject to the approval of the Knesset committee for internal affairs. In some years the decision as to which day summer time would start or end was made at the very last minute due to political haggling and this caused disruption to international airline schedules at Ben Gurion Airport. A tragicomical demonstration of the uncertainty around IDT was in 1999 when two Palestinian car bombs exploded one hour too early, killing only the bombers themselves.
This schedule was variable: the only requirement was that there be at least 150 days per year of IDT, and the dates were set out each year by the Ministry of the Interior.
