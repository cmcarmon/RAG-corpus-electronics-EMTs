Because video amplifiers require good uniformity, 
in frequency response only direct or RC coupling is 
used. Direct coupling provides the best frequency 
response, whereas RC coupling has economic ad-
vantages. The RC-coupled amplifier also has a flat re-
sponse in the middle frequency range that is suitable 
for video amplifiers. flat response is the term used 
to indicate that the gain of an amplifier varies only 
slightly within a stated frequency range. The response 
curve plotted for such an amplifier is almost a straight 
line; hence the term flat response.
