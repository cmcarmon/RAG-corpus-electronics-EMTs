The  ISO/OSI  layered  architecture  described  above  would  appear  to  be  very  rigid,  not  allowing  for  any
variations in underlying topology or variations in link reliability. However, as we shall see, this is not necessarily
the case. As an example, ISO 8348, which developed as a result of the X.25 project, provides only connection-
oriented service, and it was originally intended as the only network layer standard for ISO/OSI. However, ISO
8473, or ISO-IP, which is virtually identical to the Department of Defense (DoD) internet protocol (DoD-IP)
developed in the ARPANET project, has since been added to the protocol suite to provide connectionless service
as  well  as  internet  service.  An  interesting  aside  is  that  because  of  the  addressing  limitations  of  DoD-IP,  the
Internet Administrative Board (IAB) has recently recommended replacement of the DoD-IP protocol by the
ISO-IP protocol, thus bringing the process full circle.
