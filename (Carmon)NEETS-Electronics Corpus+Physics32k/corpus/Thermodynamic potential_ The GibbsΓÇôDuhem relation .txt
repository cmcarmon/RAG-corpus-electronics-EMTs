Deriving the Gibbs–Duhem equation from basic thermodynamic state equations is straightforward. Equating any thermodynamic potential definition with its Euler integral expression yields:




U
=
T
S
−
P
V
+

∑

μ

i



N

i




{\displaystyle U=TS-PV+\sum _{i}\mu _{i}N_{i}}

Differentiating, and using the second law:




d
U
=
T

S
−
P
d
V

∑

{\displaystyle dU=TdS-PdV+\sum _{i}\mu _{i}\,dN_{i}}

yields:




0

{\displaystyle 0=SdT-VdP+\sum _{i}N_{i}d\mu _{i}}

Which is the Gibbs–Duhem relation. The Gibbs–Duhem is a relationship among the intensive parameters of the system. It follows that for a simple system with I components, there will be I + 1 independent parameters, or degrees of freedom. For example, a simple system with a single component will have two degrees of freedom, and may be specified by only two parameters, such as pressure and volume for example. The law is named after Josiah Willard Gibbs and Pierre Duhem.
