MAGNETIC HEAD CONSTRUCTION.â€”A magnetic head is a magnetic core wrapped with a
coil of very thin wire (see figure 1-4). The core material is usually shaped like the letter C, and is made
from either iron or ceramic-ferrite material. The number of turns of wire placed on the core depends on
the purpose of that specific head. The gap in the core is called a head gap. It's here that magnetic
recording actually takes place. We'll go into more detail of magnetic head construction in chapter 3.
