In a perfect gas, there are no potential energy interactions between the particles, so any change in the internal energy of the gas is directly proportional to the change in the kinetic energy of its constituent species and therefore also to the change in temperature:




d
⁡
U
∝
d
⁡
T


{\displaystyle \operatorname {d} U\propto \operatorname {d} T}
.
The internal pressure is taken to be at constant temperature, therefore




d
T
=
0


{\displaystyle dT=0}
, which implies



d
U
=
0


{\displaystyle dU=0}
and finally




π

T


=
0


{\displaystyle \pi _{T}=0}
,
i.e. the internal energy of a perfect gas is independent of the volume it occupies. The above relation can be used as a definition of a perfect gas.
The relation




π

T


=
0


{\displaystyle \pi _{T}=0}
can be proved without the need to invoke any molecular arguments. It follows directly from the thermodynamic equation of state if we use the ideal gas law



p
V
=
n
R
T


{\displaystyle pV=nRT}
.
