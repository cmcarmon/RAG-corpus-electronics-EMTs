The OPERATION OF A TRIODE depends on the ability of the control grid to either increase or
decrease conduction through the tube in response to an ac input signal. The output voltage is developed
across the tube between the cathode and plate because of the voltage drop across the plate-load resistor
changing as the plate current responds to the input signal.
