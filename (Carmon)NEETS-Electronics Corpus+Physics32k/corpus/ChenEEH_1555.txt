or through analogies between similar problems. In a network
environment, an expert system may interact with other
systems, such as by obtaining information from a database or
by consulting other expert systems. Similar to human experts,
an expert system should be able to explain its reasoning pro-
cess, justify its conclusion, and answer questions about the
inference procedure. The explanation ability is also important
in the development of the expert system. It enables the de-
signer to validate the encoded knowledge and the reasoning
algorithms. Finally, for real-world applications that require
real-time response, an expert system should perform well
under time and resource constraints.
