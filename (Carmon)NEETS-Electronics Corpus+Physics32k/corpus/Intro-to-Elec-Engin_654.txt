For v → −∞, i = 0 since D1 will be off and D2 on. With D1 at its breakpoint, the circuit
is drawn in Figure E7.2.7(b). It follows that i = 0 and v1 = v + 12; but one does not know the
value of v1 and the state of D2. If one assumes v1 > 10 V, then D2 will be off and there is no
source for the current i1 = v1/4. Hence one concludes that D2 must be on and v1 = 10 V. Then
the corresponding i–v breakpoint is at i = 0 and v = −2 V.
