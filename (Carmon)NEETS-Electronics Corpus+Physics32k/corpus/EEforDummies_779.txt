For most electronics projects, including the ones in this book, you use 20‐ or 
22‐gauge wire. If you’re hooking up a motor to a power supply, you need to 
use 16‐ or 18‐gauge wire. You may find smaller 28‐ or 30‐gauge wire useful for 
making connections on small circuit board prototypes. 30‐gauge wire was 
commonly used for connecting components on special circuit boards using a 
technique known as wire wrapping, which is rarely done anymore. (Refer to 
Chapter 15 for details on circuit construction.)
