The general challenges driving card technology trends may be deﬁned by four simple words: faster, cheaper,
more, easier. Technical solutions to come should allow multi-application (more), ﬂexible functional proﬁle i.e.,
easy changeable dedicated applications (easier), shorter, nonspeciﬁc technology-tied development cycle (faster),
shorter  time  to  market  (more,  cheaper),  higher  security  level  (easier). All  of  the  above  points  to  a  generally
named card open OS solution.
