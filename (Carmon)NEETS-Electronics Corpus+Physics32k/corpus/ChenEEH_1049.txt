their input capacitances. Reducing these capacitances yields
savings in power consumption. Resizing does not always
imply downsizing. Power can also be reduced by enlarging
heavily loaded gates to increase their output slew rates. Fast
transitions minimize short-circuit power of the gates in the
fan-out of the gate that has been sized up, but the gateâ€™s
capacitance is increased. In most cases, resizing is a complex
optimization problem involving a trade-off between output
switching power and internal short circuit power on several
gates at the same time with the constraint being set on per-
formance by the critical path timing.
