Shadows from the general illumination systems can be desirable for accenting the depth and forms of various
objects, but harsh shadows should be avoided. Shadows are softer and less pronounced when large diffusing
luminaires are used or the object is illuminated from many sources. Clearly deÔ¨Åned shadows are distinct aids
in  some  specialized  operations,  such  as  engraving  on  polished  surfaces,  some  type  of  bench  layout  work,  or
certain textile inspections. This type of shadow effect can best be obtained by supplementary directional lighting
combined with ample diffused general illumination.
