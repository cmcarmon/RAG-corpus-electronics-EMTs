Before leaving ﬁlter design, it is worth noting that a SAW ﬁlter is composed of two transducers which may
have  different  center  frequencies,  bandwidth,  and  other  ﬁlter  speciﬁcations.  This  provides  a  great  deal  of
ﬂexibility  in  designing  a  ﬁlter  by  allowing  the  product  of  two  frequency  responses  to  achieve  the  total  ﬁlter
speciﬁcation.
