The SPECTRUM ANALYZER is a device that sweeps over a band of frequencies to determine (1)
what frequencies are being produced by a specific circuit under test and (2) the amplitude of each
frequency component. To accomplish this, the spectrum analyzer first presents a pattern on a display.
Then the relative amplitudes of the various frequencies of the spectrum of the pattern are plotted (see
figure 2-14). On the vertical, or Y axis, the amplitudes are plotted; on the horizontal, or X axis, the
frequencies (time base) are plotted. The overall pattern of this display indicates the proportion of power
present at the various frequencies within the SPECTRUM (fundamental frequency with sideband
frequencies).
