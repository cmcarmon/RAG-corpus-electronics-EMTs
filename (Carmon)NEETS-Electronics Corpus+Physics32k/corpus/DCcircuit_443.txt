The deÔ¨Åning characteristic of a parallel circuit is that all components are connected between
the same set of electrically common points. Looking at the schematic diagram, we see that
points 1, 2, 3, and 4 are all electrically common. So are points 8, 7, 6, and 5. Note that all
resistors as well as the battery are connected between these two sets of points.
