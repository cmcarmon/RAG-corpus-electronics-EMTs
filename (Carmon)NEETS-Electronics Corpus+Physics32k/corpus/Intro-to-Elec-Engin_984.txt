In motor and generator action, the magnetic Ô¨Åelds tend to line up, pole to pole. When their
complete alignment is prevented by the need to furnish torque to a mechanical shaft load, motor
action results when electric to mechanical energy conversion takes place. On the other hand, when
the alignment is prevented by the application of a mechanical torque to the rotor from a source of
mechanical energy, generator action results when mechanical to electric energy conversion takes
place.
