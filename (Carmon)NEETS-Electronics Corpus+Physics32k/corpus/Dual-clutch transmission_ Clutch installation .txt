Currently, three variations of clutch installation are used. The original design used a concentric arrangement, where both clutches shared the same plane when viewed perpendicularly from the transmission input shaft, along the same centre line as the engine crankshaft; when viewed head-on along the length of the input shaft, this makes one clutch noticeably larger than the other.
The second implementation uses two single-plate dry clutches â€“ side-by-side from the perpendicular view, but again sharing the centre line of the crankshaft.
A later variation uses two separate but identically sized clutches. These are arranged side-by-side when viewed head-on (along the length of the input shaft and crankshaft centre line), and also share the same plane when viewed perpendicularly. This latter clutch arrangement (unlike the other two variations) is driven by a gear from the engine crankshaft.
