Discussion
The  phase  plane  approach  is  useful  for  understanding  the  effects  of  nonlinearity  in  second  order  systems,
particularly if it may be approximated by a linear segmented characteristic. Solutions for the trajectories with
other nonlinear characteristics may not be possible analytically so that approximate sketching techniques were
used in early work on nonlinear control. These approaches are described in many books, for example, [Blaquiere,
1966; Cosgriff, 1958; Cunningham, 1958; Gibson, 1963; Graham and McRuer, 1961; Hayashi, 1964, Thaler and
Pastel, 1962; West, 1960]. Although the trajectories are now easily obtained with modern simulation techniques,
knowledge of the topological aspects of the phase plane are still useful for interpreting the responses in different
regions of the phase plane and appreciating the system behavior.
