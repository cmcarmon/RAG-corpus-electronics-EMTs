This section provides a brief overview of how to use a solderless bread-
board. I explain much more about solderless breadboards in Chapter 15, and 
I strongly encourage you to read that chapter before you get too deep into 
building circuits because you need to know about the limitations of these 
handy circuit‐building platforms.
