Alloys of nickel and iron, in which the nickel content is the greater, can be capable of a reversal of magne-
tization  by  the  application  of  a  magnetic  ﬁeld,  H,  which  is  weaker  than  the  earth’s  magnetic  ﬁeld  (0.5 Oe,
40 A/m) by a factor of ﬁve. (To avoid confusion caused by the geomagnetic ﬁeld it would be necessary to screen
the sample, for example, by surrounding it by a shield of equally soft material or by measuring the earth’s ﬁeld
