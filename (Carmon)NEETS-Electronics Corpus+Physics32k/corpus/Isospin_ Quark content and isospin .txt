In the modern formulation, Isospin (I) is defined as a vector quantity in which Up and Down quarks have a value of I = ​1⁄2, with the 3rd-component (I3) being ​1⁄2 for Up quarks, and −​1⁄2 for Down quarks, while all other quarks have I = 0. In general, therefore

where nu and nd are the numbers of up and down quarks respectively.
In any combination of quarks, the 3rd component of the isospin vector (I3) could either be aligned between a pair of quarks, or face the opposite direction, giving different possible values for Total Isospin for any combination of quark flavours. Hadrons with the same quark content but different Total Isospin can be distinguished experimentally, verifying that flavour is actually a vector quantity, not a scalar (up vs down simply being a projection in the quantum mechanical z-axis of flavour-space).
For example, a strange quark can be combined with an up and a down quark to form a baryon, but there are two different ways the isospin values can combine - either adding (due to being flavour-aligned) or cancelling out (due to being in opposite flavour-directions). The Isospin 1 state (the Sigma 0) and the isospin 0 state (the Lambda 0) have different experimentally detected masses and half-lives.
