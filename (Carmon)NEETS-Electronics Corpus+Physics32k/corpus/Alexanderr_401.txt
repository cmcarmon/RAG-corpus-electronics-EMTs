Each  degree  in  engineering  represents  certain  skills  the  student
acquires. At the Bachelor degree level, you learn the language of engi-
neering  and  the  fundamentals  of  engineering  and  design. At  the  Mas-
ter’s level, you acquire the ability to do advanced engineering projects
and to communicate your work effectively both orally and in writing.
The Ph.D. represents a thorough understanding of the fundamentals of
electrical  engineering  and  a  mastery  of  the  skills  necessary  both  for
working at the frontiers of an engineering area and for communicating
one’s effort to others.
