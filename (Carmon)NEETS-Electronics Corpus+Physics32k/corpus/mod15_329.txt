Let's consider further the important characteristic of gyroscopic precession. For a given amount of 
force, the rate of precession of a gyro is governed by the weight, shape, and speed of the rotor. These 
factors are the same as those that determine the rigidity of a gyro. Therefore, there is a definite 
relationship between the rigidity of a gyro and the rate at which a given force will cause it to precess. The 
greater the rigidity of a gyro, the more difficult it is to cause precession, and the less precession there will 
be for a given force.
