The type of material the wire is coiled around greatly impacts the strength of the mag-
netic ﬁeld ﬂux (and therefore the amount of stored energy) generated for any given amount
of current through the coil. Coil cores made of ferromagnetic materials (such as soft iron) will
encourage stronger ﬁeld ﬂuxes to develop with a given ﬁeld force than nonmagnetic substances
such as aluminum or air.
