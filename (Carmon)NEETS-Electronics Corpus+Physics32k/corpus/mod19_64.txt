A rescuer who has not been properly trained should not attempt CPR. 
Everyone who works around electricity should be trained. (To learn CPR, consult a 
hospital corpsman.) Improperly done, CPR can cause serious damage. Therefore, it 
is never practiced on a healthy individual for training purposes; a training aid is 
used instead.
