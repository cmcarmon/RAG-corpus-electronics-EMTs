Array:  Several antennas arranged together in space and interconnected to produce a desired radiation pattern.
Directivity:  The ratio of the actual radiated power per solid angle to the radiated power per solid angle that
would result if the radiated power was radiated isotropically. Oftentimes the word directivity is used to
refer to the maximum directivity.
