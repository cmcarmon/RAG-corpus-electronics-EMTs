(b) A magnetic force exists between two adja-
cent, parallel, current-carrying wires. Let I1
and I2 be the currents carried by the wires
and r the separation between them. Use the
result of part (a) to Ô¨Ånd the force between the
wires. Discuss the nature of the force when
the wires carry currents in the same direction,
and in opposite directions.
