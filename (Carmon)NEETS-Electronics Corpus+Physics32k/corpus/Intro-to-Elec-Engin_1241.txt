phase referred to the stator is 0.1 . Neglect
the stator resistance and rotational and stray-load
losses. Find the rotor copper loss at full load and
the speed at maximum torque. Compute the value
of the per-phase rotor resistance (referred to the
stator) that must be added in series to produce a
starting torque equal to the maximum torque.
