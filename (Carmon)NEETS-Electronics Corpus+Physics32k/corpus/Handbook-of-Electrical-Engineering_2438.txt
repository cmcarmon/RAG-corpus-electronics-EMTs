V
 = +2 V is shown. The gate-to-channel bias voltage at the source end is
 = â€“2 V, so the depletion
still 
region will now be substantially wider at the drain end of the channel than at the source end. This leads to a
further  constriction  of  the  channel  at  the  drain  end,  and  this  will  again  result  in  a  decrease  in  the  channel
conductance 
curve will be smaller at
