Two BASIC TECHNIQUES are used for measuring the modal bandwidth of an optical fiber. The
first characterizes dispersion by measuring the IMPULSE RESPONSE h(t) of the fiber in the time
domain. The second characterizes modal dispersion by measuring the BASEBAND FREQUENCY
RESPONSE H(f) of the fiber in the frequency domain.
