Constrained Optimization
As mentioned in Section 5.6, power optimization can take the
form of a constrained optimization problem where perform-
ance degradation is acceptable to a given bound. Thus, power
minimization requires optimal exploitation of the slack on
performance constraints. To this end, many CAD tools that
implement optimization algorithms were developed to opti-
mize an architecture from a power point of view given some
timing constraints with other speciÔ¨Åcations.
