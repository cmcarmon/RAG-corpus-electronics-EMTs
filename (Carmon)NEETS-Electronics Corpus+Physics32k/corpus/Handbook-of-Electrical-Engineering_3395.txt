D/A and A/D conversion circuits are available as integrated circuits (ICs) from many manufacturers. A huge
array of ICs exists, consisting of not only the D/A or A/D conversion circuits, but also closely related circuits
such as sample-and-hold ampliﬁers, analog multiplexers, voltage-to-frequency and frequency-to-voltage con-
verters,  voltage  references,  calibrators,  operation  ampliﬁers,  isolation  ampliﬁers,  instrumentation  ampliﬁers,
active  ﬁlters,  dc-to-dc  converters,  analog  interfaces  to  digital  signal  processing  systems,  and  data  acquisition
subsystems. Data books from the IC manufacturers contain an enormous amount of information about these
devices and their applications to assist the design engineer.
