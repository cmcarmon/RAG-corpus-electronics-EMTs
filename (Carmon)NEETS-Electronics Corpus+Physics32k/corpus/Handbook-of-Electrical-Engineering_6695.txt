There were several basic types of transmission schemes in use in early LANs. Three of these received serious
 and carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA). In a
consideration for standardization: the 
token ring network, the stations are conﬁgured on a physical ring around the medium. A token rotates around
this physical ring, visiting each host (or station) in turn. A station wishing to transmit data must wait until the
token is available to that station. In a token bus LAN, the situation is the same, except that the stations share
a common bus and the ring is logical rather than physical. In a CSMA network, the stations are bus connected,
and a station may transmit whenever other stations are not currently transmitting. That is, a station wishing
to transmit senses the channel, and if there is no activity, the station may transmit. Of course, the actual access
protocol is signiﬁcantly more complicated than this.
