Single  LEDs  are  commonly  driven  by  logic  gates,  perhaps  as  status  indicators,  and  some  of  the  simplest
interface  circuits  are  shown  in  Fig. 83.6.  In  many  cases,  the  gate  output  will  not  be  able  to  source  or  sink
sufﬁcient current for visibility, and an ampliﬁer will be required, as in Fig. 83.7. Bar graph displays are commonly
