Types of Transformers
Transformers are broadly grouped into two main categories: dry-type and liquid-Ô¨Ålled transformers. Dry-type
transformers are cooled by natural or forced circulation of air or inert gas through or around the transformer
enclosure. Dry-type transformers are further subdivided into ventilated, sealed, or encapsulated types depending
upon the construction of the transformer. Dry transformers are extensively used in industrial power distribution
for rating up to 5000 kVA and 34.5 kV.
