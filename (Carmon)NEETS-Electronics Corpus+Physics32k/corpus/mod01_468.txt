Power, whether electrical or mechanical, pertains to the rate at which work is being done. Work is
done whenever a force causes motion. When a mechanical force is used to lift or move a weight, work is
done. However, force exerted WITHOUT causing motion, such as the force of a compressed spring acting
between two fixed objects, does not constitute work.
