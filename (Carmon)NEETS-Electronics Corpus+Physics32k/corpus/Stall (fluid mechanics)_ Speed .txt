Stalls depend only on angle of attack, not airspeed. However, the slower an airplane goes, the more angle of attack it needs to produce lift equal to the aircraft's weight. As the speed decreases further, at some point this angle will be equal to the critical (stall) angle of attack. This speed is called the "stall speed". An aircraft flying at its stall speed cannot climb, and an aircraft flying below its stall speed cannot stop descending. Any attempt to do so by increasing angle of attack, without first increasing airspeed, will result in a stall.
The actual stall speed will vary depending on the airplane's weight, altitude, configuration, and vertical and lateral acceleration. Guidelines for the case of zero acceleration are provided by the following V speeds:
VS: The computed stalling speed with flaps retracted at design speed. Often has the same value as VS1.
VS0: The stall speed in landing configuration (full flaps, landing gear down, spoilers retracted).
VS1: The stall speed in a "clean" configuration (flaps, landing gear and spoilers all retracted as far as possible).
VSR: Reference stall speed.
VSR0: Reference stall speed in the landing configuration.
VSR1: Reference stall speed in the clean configuration.
VSW: Speed at which onset of natural or artificial stall warning occurs.
On an airspeed indicator, the bottom of the white arc indicates VS0 at maximum weight, while the bottom of the green arc indicates VS1 at maximum weight. While an aircraft's VS speed is computed by design, its VS0 and VS1 speeds must be demonstrated empirically by flight testing.
