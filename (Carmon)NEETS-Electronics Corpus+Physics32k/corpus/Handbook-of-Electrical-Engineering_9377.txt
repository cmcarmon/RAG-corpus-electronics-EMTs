objects. These systems have a descriptive language which uses a database of 3-D primitive objects such as block,
cylinder, sphere, wedge, cone, and torus. These solids are combined to form other solids using the set operators
of union, intersection, and difference. The resultant object can then be named, saved, and positioned into a
picture or drawing. Attributes stored with the objects allow them to be displayed in wire-frame format or as a
completely  rendered  image.  Representative  SM  systems  are  MAGI  (Mathematical Applications  Group,  Inc.),
