Note that the linearization of equation 7.51 will be a good
approximation if the estimate xk is close to the true solution of
x since F(x) ¼ 0. The NR algorithm stated in equation 7.52
can be proved to converge to the true solution x when the
initial condition x0 is sufﬁciently close to x. On the other hand,
for initial conditions away from x, the approximation of equa-
tion 7.51 becomes poorly justiﬁed, and the iterations can
quickly diverge away from x. When the iterations converge,
owing to the linearized nature of the algorithm, the norm of the
error decreases to zero in a ‘‘quadratic’’ fashion. Roughly speak-
ing, the ratios of the error norm from one iteration to the square
of the error norm in the previous iteration tend to be a constant.
An example would be that the error norms decrease from 0.1 in
one iteration, to 0.01 in the next iteration, to 0.0001 in the
following iteration. Therefore, given good initial conditions,
the NR algorithm can typically get to an accurate solution
estimate within a few iterations.
