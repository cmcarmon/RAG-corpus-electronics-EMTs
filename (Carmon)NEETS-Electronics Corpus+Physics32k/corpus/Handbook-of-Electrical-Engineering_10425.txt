A decisionmaker views a dynamic encounter as a temporally varying, geographically dispersed system subject
to unpredictable events, both continuous and discrete. Because critical command decisions have an extended
period of inﬂuence, the actions taken at different time scales cannot be isolated from each other. This issue of
scale interaction comes to the fore particularly when hominal modeling is considered. In contrast to inanimate
objects which usually have a single, natural time scale, the demands on a commander transcend the time scale
divisions.  A  trained  decisionmaker  exhibits  a  wide  spectrum  of  behaviors  as  both  his  tasks  and  operating
environments  change;  the  commander  is  the  truly  adaptive  block  in  a  command  and  control  architecture.
Athans  referred  to  C3  systems  as “event  driven”  because  major  changes  in  an  engagement  occur  at  isolated
times and modulate the more frequent local irregularities [Athans, 1987]. He suggested that the proper model
would be a hybrid in which “the state variables are both continuous and discrete.” In this metapartitioning of
the comprehensive state space, the discrete states represent global (or macro) occurrences that modulate the
local (or micro) aspects. This decomposition is useful in formulating the human response model because people
react differently in different time scales. The reaction to local phenomena has a reﬂexive quality. It is in this
reaction to the infrequent, but pivotal, macroevents that the idiosyncracies thought to be particularly human
are manifest.
