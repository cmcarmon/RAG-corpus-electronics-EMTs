The technical challenge for the lighting industry is to produce a miniature point source that delivers
high  efﬁcacy,  high  color  temperature,  and  long  lifetime.  The  challenge  for  the  immediate  future  is  to
push  the  arc  gap  even  smaller  while  extending  the  lamp  life  to  be  comparable  to  today’s  CRTs  and
maintaining lumen output and good color temperature. Furthermore, all these requirements have to be
met at a very low cost.
