Halstead’s theory has been applied to English (Moby Dick) and
a  number  of  programs  written  in  both  HLL  and  machine-level
languages. A few results based on the values reported in Halstead
[1977] are given in Table 87.4. This theory quantiﬁes the level of
a programming language: PL/I is higher level than Algol-58, but
lower level than English.
