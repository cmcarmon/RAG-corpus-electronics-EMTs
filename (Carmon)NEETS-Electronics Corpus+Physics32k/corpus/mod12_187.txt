Envelope Development from Vectors.â€”The modulating signal, upper sideband, carrier, and lower 
sideband waveforms are illustrated in views (A) through (D), respectively, in figure 1-43. Notice that the 
vertical lines passing through the figure divide each waveform into segments of 1/8 of a second each. 
These lines also coincide with the starting and ending points of each cycle of the carrier wave.
