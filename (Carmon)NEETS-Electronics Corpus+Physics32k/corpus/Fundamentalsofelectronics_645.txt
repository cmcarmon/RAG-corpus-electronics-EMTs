Response) because their unit sample responses have ﬁnite duration. Plotting this response (Fig-
ure 5.19) shows that the unit-sample response is a pulse of width q and height 1
. This waveform
q
is also known as a boxcar, hence the name boxcar ﬁlter given to this system. We’ll derive its
frequency response and develop its ﬁltering interpretation in the next section. For now, note that
the diﬀerence equation says that each output value equals the average of the input’s current and
previous values. Thus, the output equals the running average of input’s previous q values. Such a
system could be used to produce the average weekly temperature (q = 7) that could be updated
daily.
