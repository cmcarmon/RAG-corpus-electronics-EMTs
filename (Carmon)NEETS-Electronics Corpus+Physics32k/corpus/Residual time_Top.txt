In the theory of renewal processes, a part of the mathematical theory of probability, the residual time or the forward recurrence time is the time between any given time



t


{\displaystyle t}
and the next epoch of the renewal process under consideration. In the context of random walks, it is also known as overshoot. Another way to phrase residual time is "how much longer time is there to wait?".
The residual time is very important in most of the practical applications of renewal processes:
In queueing theory, it determines the remaining time, that a newly arriving customer to a non-empty queue has to wait until being served.
In wireless networking, it determines, for example, the remaining lifetime of a wireless link on arrival of a new packet.
In dependability studies, it models the remaining lifetime of a component.
etc.
