Synchronous  Machine  Parameters. When  a  disturbance,  such  as  a  short  circuit  at  the  machine  terminals,
takes place, the dynamics of a synchronous machine will be observed before a new steady state is reached. Such
a process typically takes a few seconds and can be divided into subprocesses. The damper windings (armortis-
seur) exhibit their effect only during the ﬁrst few cycles when the difference in speed between the rotor and
the perturbed stator ﬁeld is signiﬁcant. This period is referred to as subtransient. The next and longer period,
which is between the subtransient and the new steady state, is called transient.
