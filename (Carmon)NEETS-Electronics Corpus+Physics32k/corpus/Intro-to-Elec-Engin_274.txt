The denominator of F1(s) may not be known in the factored form in some cases, and it will
then become necessary to ﬁnd the roots of the denominator polynomial. If the order is higher
than a quadratic and simple inspection (or some engineering approximation) does not help, one
may have to take recourse to the computer. Computer programs for ﬁnding roots of a polynomial
equation (using such methods as Newton–Raphson) are available these days in most computer
libraries.
