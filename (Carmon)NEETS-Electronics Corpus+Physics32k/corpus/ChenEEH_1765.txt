multimedia applications require multicasting. For example,
multiparty audio/video conferencing is one of the most widely
used services in Internet telephony. If multicasting is not
naturally supported by the communication network (as was
the case in some circuit-switched networks) then signiﬁcant
efforts need to be invested in building multimedia applications
that support this functionality in an overlaid fashion, which
often leads to inefﬁcient bandwidth utilization.
