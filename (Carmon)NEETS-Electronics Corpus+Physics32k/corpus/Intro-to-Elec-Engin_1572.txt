the quantizer has a gain of Kq > 1, what does that
imply?
15.3.5 A symmetrically ﬂuctuating message that has a
crest factor KCR = 3 and f 2(t ) = 2.25 V2 is
to be quantized such that the signal-to-noise ratio
S0/Nq = 2700. If the quantizer is to use the
smallest number of levels that is a power of 2,
ﬁnd the following:
