Since the early 1940s, magnetic recording has been the mainstay of electronic information storage worldwide.
Audio tapes provided the ﬁrst major application for the storage of information on magnetic media. Magnetic
tape has been used extensively in consumer products such as audio tapes and video cassette recorders (VCRs);
it has also found application in backup/archival storage of computer ﬁles, satellite images, medical records, etc.
Large volumetric capacity and low cost are the hallmarks of tape data storage, although sequential access to
the  recorded  information  is  perhaps  the  main  drawback  of  this  technology.  Magnetic  hard  disk  drives  have
been used as mass storage devices in the computer industry ever since their inception in 1957. With an areal
density that has doubled roughly every other year, hard disks have been and remain the medium of choice for
secondary storage in computers.1 Another magnetic data storage device, the ﬂoppy disk, has been successful in
areas where compactness, removability, and fairly rapid access to the recorded information have been of prime
concern. In addition to providing backup and safe storage, inexpensive ﬂoppies with their moderate capacities
(2  Mbyte  on  a  3.5-in.  diameter  platter  is  typical  nowadays)  and  reasonable  transfer  rates  have  provided  the
crucial function of ﬁle/data transfer between isolated machines. All in all, it has been a great half-century of
progress  and  market  dominance  for  magnetic  recording  devices,  which  are  only  now  beginning  to  face  a
potentially serious challenge from the technology of optical recording.
