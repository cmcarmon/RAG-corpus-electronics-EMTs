The first time zone standard in Taiwan was enforced in 1 January 1896, the second year of Taiwan under Japanese rule. The standard is called Western Standard Time (西部標準時) with time offset of UTC+08:00, based on 120°E longitude. In 1 October 1937, the Western Standard Time zone is abolished and the Central Standard Time (中央標準時), with time offset of UTC+09:00, was enforced in the entire country of Japan including Taiwan. This time was used until the end of the Second World War. In 21 September 1945, the Governor-General of Taiwan announced to revoke the order in 1937.
After the war's end, Taiwan was annexed to the five time zones system of the Republic of China and was classified in the Chungyuan Standard Time (中原標準時間) with time offset of UTC+08:00. After the Chinese Civil War in 1949, the Central Government of the Republic of China retreated to Taiwan and lost nearly all the territory of mainland China. From this time, the five time zones system was no longer implemented except Chungyuan Standard Time on Taiwan. After the 1990s, the democratization movement brought more localization thinking in Taiwan. The term Chungyuan (Zhongyuan), which means the Central Plain of China, is considered as Sinocentrism. Thus the government on Taiwan now favors the term National Standard Time (國家標準時間) as official use. Along with the governmental standard, popular alternatives include Taiwan Standard Time (臺灣標準時間), Taipei Time (臺北時間) and Formosan Time (寶島時間).
Daylight saving time was implemented in Taiwan after the Second World War on the summer of 1946–1961, 1974, 1975, 1979.
In 2017, a petition took place to change the offset to UTC+09:00, which was responded by an assessment of potential impact by the government.
