DETECTION.â€”Once the IF stages have amplified the intermediate frequency to a sufficient level,
it is fed to the detector. When the mixer is referred to as the first detector, this stage would be called the
second detector. The detector extracts the modulating audio signal. The detector stage consists of a
rectifying device and filter, which respond only to the amplitude variations of the IF signal. This develops
an output voltage varying at an audio-frequency rate. The output from the detector is further amplified in
the audio amplifier and is used to drive a speaker or earphones.
