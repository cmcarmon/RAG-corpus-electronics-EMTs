the image is computed, and each pixel is replaced by the
difference between this maximum value and itself. Next, for
each pixel we look at whether a neighbor pixel is larger than
itself. If this is the case, the output pixel is false; otherwise it is
true. The complete cavity detection algorithm contains some
more functions, but these have been left out here for simpli-
