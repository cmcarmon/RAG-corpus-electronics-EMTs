In 1864 Boulton looked at the problems of combustion at constant pressure, in connection with the operation of an industrial gas turbine. His British patent, No. 1636 of 1864, contains points of interest. He realized that the high velocity of the gas jet exiting his combustion chamber nozzle offered a practical difficulty, and proposed to remedy this by the use of successive induced jets of increasing volume and consequently lower velocity. This was shown in his drawing, with gases being delivered through collinear nozzles of increasing diameter, with the outer nozzles operating at increased gas volumes with reduced velocities, similar to the exhaust of a high-bypass turbofan jet engine.
Another method proposed by Boulton for maintaining combustion at constant pressure was shown with gas burned in an inverted chamber under water, the products of combustion passing up through the water between the baffle plates and the mixed gases and steam being later delivered to a turbine. He went on to file a number of patents related to his gas turbine research (see patents).
Boulton also attempted to build an ornithopter, an aircraft which would create lift by the movement of its articulating wings. Manned ornithopters were later successful created in 2006 when teams at the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies (UTIAS) achieved working designs for them with large flapping wing areas.
