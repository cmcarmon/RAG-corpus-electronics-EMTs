Dynamic Threshold Technique
Dynamic threshold MOS (DTMOS), as noted by Fariborz et al.
(1997), is a scheme that allows for a self-adjusting threshold
voltage. By tying the gate to the body, the threshold voltage
decreases as the gate voltage increases and vice versa. In this
manner, a higher zero-bias threshold can be used to reduce the
leakage current. In a speed-adaptive threshold-voltage CMOS
(SA-Vt CMOS) circuit miyazaki (1998) the substrate bias is
controlled so that delay in the circuit stays constant. Distribu-
tions of device speeds are squeezed under fast-operation con-
ditions. With a ring oscillator using 0.25-mm CMOS devices as
a test circuit, the worst-case operating frequency was improved
from 20 MHz to 55 MHz, and the ï¬‚uctuation of the operating
frequency was suppressed from 44 to 15%; the supply-voltage
variation was under 0.1 V with a 1.8-V supply voltage.
