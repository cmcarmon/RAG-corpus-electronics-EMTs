View A of figure 4-4 is a comparison of the rms, peak, and average values of the types of waveforms 
associated with the half-wave rectifier. Ac voltages are normally specified in terms of their rms values. 
Thus, when a 115-volt ac power source is mentioned in this chapter, it is specifying the rms value of 115 
volts ac. In terms of peak values,
