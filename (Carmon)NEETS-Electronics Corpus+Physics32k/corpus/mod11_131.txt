The physical construction of a typical twt is shown in figure 2-13. The twt contains an electron gun 
which produces and then accelerates an electron beam along the axis of the tube. The surrounding magnet 
provides a magnetic field along the axis of the tube to focus the electrons into a tight beam. The HELIX, 
at the center of the tube, is a coiled wire that provides a low-impedance transmission line for the rf energy 
within the tube. The rf input and output are coupled onto and removed from the helix by directional 
couplers that have no physical connection to the helix. If the rf energy is transported on coaxial cables, the 
coaxial couplers are wound in a helical manner similar to that shown in figure 2-13. If the rf energy is 
transported in waveguides, waveguide directional couplers are used. The attenuator prevents any reflected 
waves from traveling back down the helix.
