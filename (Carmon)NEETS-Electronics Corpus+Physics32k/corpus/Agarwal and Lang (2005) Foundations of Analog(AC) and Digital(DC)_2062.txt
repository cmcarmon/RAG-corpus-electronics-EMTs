Recall that for a series resonant circuit Q = ωoL/R = (
L/C)/R. Note from the previous
equation that at the resonance frequency, the amplitude of the output is Q times the
amplitude of the input. For the parameters in Figure 14.37, the resonance frequency
ω◦ = 62.017 krad/s, or 9.8074 kHz. At the resonance frequency, the amplitude of vC is
24.8069 V, which is not the maximum amplitude, but is very close it. Note too that
Q = 24.8069.

(c) The damped resonant frequency is ωd =
is the oscillation frequency of the homogeneous response, and thus the oscillation
frequency of the response to initial conditions. For the parameters in Figure 14.37,
ωd = 62.005 krad/s, or 9.8684 kHz. At this frequency,
the amplitude of vC is
24.8107 V, which is again very close to the maximum amplitude.
