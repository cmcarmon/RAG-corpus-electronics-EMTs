You may assume that the operational amplifier has ideal characteristics, including zero
input current and output resistance and further make the simplifying assumption that
its open-loop gain is infinite. Also, assume that the amplifier does not saturate.
a) With v2 = 0, what is the value of the gain vO/v1?
b) Voltage v2 is now made 3 volts. Plot the vO vs. v1 characteristics. Be sure to show
