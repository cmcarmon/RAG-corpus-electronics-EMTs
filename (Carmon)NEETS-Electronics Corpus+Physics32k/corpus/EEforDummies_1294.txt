If you want it, Digi‐Key probably has it. Like Allied Electronics, Digi‐Key is a 
stocking distributor, carrying thousands upon thousands of items. Digi‐Key 
welcomes small orders and offers reasonable USPS shipping rates. Its online 
ordering system includes detailed product information, price, available 
stock levels, and even links to product datasheets. The site offers a handy 
search engine so you can quickly locate what you’re looking for, as well as 
an online interactive catalog (with magnification capabilities you’ll need). 
Digi‐Key will also send a free printed catalog, but to read the tiny print, you 
have to get out your glasses. The text has to be teeny‐weeny to fit every-
thing in.
