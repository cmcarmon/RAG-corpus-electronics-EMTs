quantities must be squared prior to the addition. The ﬁgure
clearly shows that by 62 sec, 2 sec after the position aiding has
been removed, the acceleration measurement noise n has
become the dominant error source. The accelerometer bias
drift term is rather insigniﬁcant. Therefore, if the design ob-
jective were to maintain position accuracy less than 0.3 m for a
longer period of time, then either an independent velocity
aiding measurement or an accelerometer with less measure-
ment noise would be required.
