In the circuit shown in figure 1-6, the base-emitter bias will not allow the transistor to conduct 
whenever the input signal becomes positive. Therefore, only the negative portion of the input signal is 
reproduced in the output signal. You may wonder why a class B amplifier would be used instead of a 
simple rectifier if only half the input signal is desired in the output. The answer to this is that the rectifier 
does not amplify. The output signal of a rectifier cannot be higher in amplitude than the input signal. The 
class B amplifier not only reproduces half the input signal, but amplifies it as well.
