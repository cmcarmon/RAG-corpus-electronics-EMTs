Several forms of waves can be observed in a two-dimensional medium.
A spreading wave will originate at a single point in the medium and spread outwards. For example, a forest fire could start from a lightning strike at the centre of a forest and spread outwards.
A spiral wave will again originate at a single point, but will spread in a spiral circuit. Spiral waves are believed to underlie phenomena such as tachycardia and fibrillation.
Spiral waves constitute one of the mechanisms of fibrillation when they organize in long-lasting reentrant activities named rotors.
