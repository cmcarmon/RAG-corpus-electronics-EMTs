5.4.4 Consider the op-amp circuit of Figure P5.4.4.
Sketch the waveforms of vS and vo, if vS is a
sinusoidal voltage source with a peak value of 2 V.
5.4.5 In the ideal inverting summing ampliﬁer circuit
(see Figure 5.4.3) with two inputs, for Rf =
10 k, ﬁnd R1 and R2 so that vo = −10vi1 − 5vi2.
5.4.6 Consider Figure 5.4.4 of the noninverting sum-
ming ampliﬁer. Let Rm = (m + 0.5)50 , m =
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Also let Rd = 50  and Rf =
3 k. Find vo.
