A capacitor charges and discharges almost completely after five times 
its RC time constant, or 5RC (which means 5×R×C). After time has passed 
that’s equivalent to one time constant, a discharged capacitor will charge 
to roughly two‐thirds its capacity — and a charged capacitor will discharge 
nearly two‐thirds of the way.
