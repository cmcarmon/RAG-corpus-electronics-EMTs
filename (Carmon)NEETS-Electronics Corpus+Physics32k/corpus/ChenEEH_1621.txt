The major types of explanations include why, how, what,
what-if, and strategic explanations. The why explanations
provide justiﬁcation knowledge of the underlying reasons for
an action based on causal models. The how explanations
provide reasoning trace knowledge of the inference process.
The why and how explanations were ﬁrst introduced in
MYCIN. They remain the core of most explanation facilities
in current expert system applications and development shells.
The what explanations provide knowledge about the object
deﬁnitions or decision variables used by the system. The what-
if explanations provide direct and explicit information about
the sensitivity of decision variables. The strategic explanations
provide information about the problem-solving strategy and
metaknowledge.
