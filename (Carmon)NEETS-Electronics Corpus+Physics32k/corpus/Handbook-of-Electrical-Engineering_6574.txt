The Ô¨Årst term in the denominator of Eq. (71.12) is caused by shot noise and the second term is attributed
to thermal noise in the receiver. If the shot noise term dominates (and the APD excess loss and dark current
are negligible), the system is shot-noise limited. In this case the probability of error has an upper bound given by:
