equipped with friction clutches. When the generator is cranked faster than its rated speed, the clutch slips
and the generator speed and output voltage are not permitted to exceed their rated values. When
extremely high resistances-for example, 10,000 megohms or more-are to be measured, a high voltage is
needed to cause sufficient current flow to actuate the meter movement. For extended ranges, a 1,000-volt
generator is available.
