Five-Point Method
The  Ô¨Åve-point  method  is  an  extension  of  the  above  technique  and  allows  calculation  of  third  and  fourth
harmonic distortion factors. For distortion calculation the output is expressed as a Fourier cosine series with
terms  up  to  the  fourth  harmonic  where  the  dc  component  includes  the  quiescent  state  and  the  shift  due  to
distortion. The output waveform values at w
1t = p/3 (Fp/3), w
1t = 2p/3 (F2p/3),
1t = p (Fp), as shown in Fig. 5.20, are used to calculate Y0, Y1, Y2, Y3, and Y4.
