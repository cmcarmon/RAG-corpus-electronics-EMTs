Figure 6.6.1 shows a simpliÔ¨Åed schematic diagram of a microcomputer-controlled breadmaking
machine. A microcomputer along with its timing circuit, keypad, and display unit controls the
heating resistor, fan motor, and bread-ingredient mixing motor by means of digitally activated
switches. An analog temperature sensor, through an A/D converter, provides the status of
temperature to the microcomputer. A digital timer circuit counts down, showing the time remaining
in the process.
