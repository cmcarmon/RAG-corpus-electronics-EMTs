A steady current I flowing along a path ℓ will exert a force on nearby moving charged particles that is quantitatively different from the electric field force described above. The force exerted by I on a nearby charge q with velocity v is

The magnetic field is not conservative in general, and hence cannot usually be written in terms of a scalar potential. However, it can be written in terms of a vector potential, A(r):
