where J1 is the Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind, order one. This far-ﬁeld intensity is called the Airy pattern. As
with  the  rectangular  aperture,  the  far-ﬁeld  intensity  is  proportional  to  the  square  of  the  area  and  inversely
proportional to the square of the wavelength and the propagation distance. The ﬁrst zero (Rayleigh resolution
criteria) of the Airy pattern occurs for uL/l  = 1.22 or sinq = 1.22l/L. As with linear and rectangular apertures,
the resolution scales with l/L.
