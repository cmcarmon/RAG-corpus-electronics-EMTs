The classical nature of a pendulum precludes a full description of the effects of the adiabatic theorem. As a further example consider a quantum harmonic oscillator as the spring constant





k




{\displaystyle \scriptstyle {k}}
is increased. Classically this is equivalent to increasing the stiffness of a spring; quantum-mechanically the effect is a narrowing of the potential energy curve in the system Hamiltonian.
If

{\displaystyle \scriptstyle {k}}
is increased adiabatically

{\displaystyle \scriptstyle {n=0}}
, remains in the ground state as the potential energy curve is compressed; the functional form of the state adapting to the slowly varying conditions.
For a rapidly increased spring constant, the system undergoes a diabatic process

in which the system has no time to adapt its functional form to the changing conditions. While the final state must look identical to the initial state

for a process occurring over a vanishing time period, there is no eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian,
