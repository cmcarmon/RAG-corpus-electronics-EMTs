The Boltzmann constant, k, is a bridge between macroscopic and microscopic physics. Macroscopically, the ideal gas law states that, for an ideal gas, the product of pressure p and volume V is proportional to the product of amount of substance n (in moles) and absolute temperature T:




p
V
=
n
R
T



{\displaystyle pV=nRT\,}

where R is the gas constant (8.3144598(48) J⋅K−1⋅mol−1). Introducing the Boltzmann constant transforms the ideal gas law into an alternative form:




p
V
=
N
k
T
,


{\displaystyle pV=NkT,}

where N is the number of molecules of gas. For n = 1 mol, N is equal to the number of particles in one mole (Avogadro's number).
