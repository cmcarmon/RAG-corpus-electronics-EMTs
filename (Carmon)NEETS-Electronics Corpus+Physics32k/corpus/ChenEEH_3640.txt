Speech-processing engineers view speech production in
terms of an acoustic ﬁltering operation. Let us associate the
anatomy with such a technical model. The three main cavities
of the speech production system (vocal plus nasal tracts)
compose the main acoustic ﬁlter. Much of the information in
speech is encoded in the spectral peaks associated with given
sounds. The size and shape of the vocal tract (pharyngeal and
oral cavities) at a given instant are the principal determiners of
