The spectrum analyzer is used to examine the frequency spectrum of radar transmissions, local
oscillators, test sets, and other equipment operating within its frequency range. Proper interpretation of
the displayed frequency spectrum enables you to determine the degree of efficiency of the equipment
under test. With experience, you will be able to determine definite areas of malfunctioning components
within equipment. In any event, successful spectrum analysis depends on the proper operation of a
spectrum analyzer and your ability to correctly interpret the displayed frequencies. Later, in chapter 6, we
will discuss the various controls, indicators, and connectors contained on the spectrum analyzer.
