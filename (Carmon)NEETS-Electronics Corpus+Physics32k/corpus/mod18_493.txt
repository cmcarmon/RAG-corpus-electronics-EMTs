(You may want to refer to NEETS, Module 10, Introduction to Wave Propagation, Transmission 
Lines, and Antennas for a review of standing waves before going further.) Measurements of standing 
waves can indicate the approximate operating frequency, the presence of defective transmission-line 
sections, and the condition of the antenna. Standing waves present on transmission lines and waveguides 
indicate an impedance mismatch between a transmitter or receiver and its antenna. When this condition 
occurs, the transfer of energy between these units becomes inefficient. Reflection of energy at the load 
end of a transmission line results in a wave that travels toward the generator end. This reflected wave 
varies continuously in phase in much the same way that the incident wave varies in phase. At certain 
points, a half wavelength apart, the two waves are exactly in phase; the resultant voltage is at maximum. 
At points a quarter wavelength from the maximums, the two waves are in opposition and voltage nodes 
(null points) are produced. The ratio of maximum-to-minimum voltage at such points is called the 
VOLTAGE STANDING WAVE RATIO (vswr). The ratio of maximum-to-minimum current along a 
transmission line is the same as the vswr. A high vswr (1.5 to 1 or higher) indicates that the characteristic 
impedance of a transmission line differs greatly from the terminating impedance; a low vswr (1 to 1 is 
best) indicates a good impedance match between the transmission line characteristic impedance and the 
terminating impedance.
