Point defects that occur at fiber joints are relatively easy to identify because the location of a fiber
joint is generally known. A reflective or nonreflective fault occurs at a distance equal to fiber joint
location. In most circumstances, an optical connector produces a reflective fault, while an optical splice
produces a nonreflective fault.
