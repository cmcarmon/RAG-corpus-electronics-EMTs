The effective area can be maximized in two ways: (1) by
matching the load impedance for maximum power transfer,
which requires ZL ¼ Z
in or (2) by adjusting the incident and
receive polarization vectors such that j^rri  ^rrRj ¼ 1 ¼ j^rri  ^rrRj
whenever possible. Under these conditions, the maximum
effective area Aem can be derived from equation 6.82:
