Perhaps the easiest way to convert a ﬁgure from scientiﬁc notation to common metric pre-
ﬁxes is with a scientiﬁc calculator set to the ”engineering” or ”metric” display mode. Just set
the calculator for that display mode, type any scientiﬁc notation ﬁgure into it using the proper
keystrokes (see your owner’s manual), press the ”equals” or ”enter” key, and it should display
the same ﬁgure in engineering/metric notation.
