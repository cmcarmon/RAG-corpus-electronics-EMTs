Power varies between the peak value and 0.  Midway 
between  peak  value  and  0  is  the  average  power 
 consumed by the circuit. In an AC circuit, the average 
power is the power consumed. This can be determined 
by multiplying the effective voltage value by the effec-
tive current value. This is expressed as
