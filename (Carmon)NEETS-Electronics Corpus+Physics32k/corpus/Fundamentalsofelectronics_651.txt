This expression amounts to the Fourier transform of the boxcar signal (Figure 5.19). There we
found that this frequency response has a magnitude equal to the absolute value of dsinc (πf ); see
the length-10 ﬁlter’s frequency response (Figure 5.11). We see that boxcar ﬁlters–length-q signal
q .
averagers–have a lowpass behavior, having a cutoﬀ frequency of 1
Exercise 5.27
(Solution on p. 193.)
Suppose we multiply the boxcar ﬁlter’s coeﬃcients by a sinusoid: bm = 1
q cos (2πf0m). Use Fourier
transform properties to determine the transfer function. How would you characterize this system:
Does it act like a ﬁlter? If so, what kind of ﬁlter and how do you control its characteristics with
the ﬁlter’s coeﬃcients?
