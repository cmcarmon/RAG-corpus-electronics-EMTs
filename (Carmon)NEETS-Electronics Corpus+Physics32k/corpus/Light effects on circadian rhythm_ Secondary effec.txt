While light has direct effects on circadian rhythm, there are indirect effects seen across studies. Seasonal affective disorder creates a model in which decreased day length during autumn and winter increases depressive symptoms. A shift in the circadian phase response curve creates a connection between the amount of light in a day (day length) and depressive symptoms in this disorder. Light seems to have therapeutic antidepressant effects when an organism is exposed to it at appropriate times during the circadian rhythm, regulating the sleep-wake cycle.
In addition to mood, learning and memory become impaired when the circadian system shifts due to light stimuli, which can be seen in studies modeling jet lag and shift work situations. Frontal and parietal lobe areas involved in working memory have been implicated in melanopsin responses to light information.
In response to light exposure, alertness levels can increase as a result of suppression of melatonin secretion. A linear relationship has been found between alerting effects of light and activation in the posterior hypothalamus.
Disruption of circadian rhythm as a result of light also produces changes in metabolism.
