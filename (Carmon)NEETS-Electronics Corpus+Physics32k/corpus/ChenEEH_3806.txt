An analog image can be seen as a function f (x, y) of two
continuous space variables: x and y. The function f (x, y)
represents a variation of gray level along the spatial coordi-
nates. Since each color can be represented as a combination of
three primaries (R, G, and B), a color image can be represented
by the three functions fR(x, y), fG(x, y), and fB(x, y), one for
each color component.
A natural way to translate an analog image into the discrete
domain is to sample each variable; that is, we make x ¼ nxTx
and y ¼ nyTy. This way, we get a digital image fD(nx, ny) such
that:
