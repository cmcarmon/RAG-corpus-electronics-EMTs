Feedback circuits have a desensitizing property, which implies that variations in the values
of the op-amp parameters have little effect on the output of the circuit. “Feedback” implies
that some of the output signal is fed back to be added to the input. Another property of
feedback ampliﬁers is that the open-loop and closed-loop gain–bandwidth products are equal.
Referring to Figure 5.2.4, which shows the open-loop and closed-loop frequency responses, it
follows that
