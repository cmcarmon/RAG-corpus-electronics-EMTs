Look at the output waveform from transistor Q2, as shown in figure 3-7. The output voltage (from 
either output of the multivibrator) alternates from approximately 0 volts to approximately −VCC, 
remaining in each state for a definite period of time. The time may range from a microsecond to as much 
as a second or two. In some applications, the time period of higher voltage (−VCC) and the time period of 
lower voltage (0 volts) will be equal. Other applications require differing higher- and lower-voltage times. 
For example, timing and gating circuits often have different pulse widths as shown in figure 3-8.
