Figure  8.6  shows  the  circuit  of  an  inverting 
amplifier  with  negative  feedback  applied.  For  the 
sake  of  our  explanation  we  will  assume  that  the 
operational amplifier is ‘ideal’. Now consider what 
happens  when  a  small  positive  input  voltage  is 
applied. This voltage (VIN) produces a current (IIN)
flowing in the input resistor R1. 
  Since the operational amplifier is ‘ideal’ we will 
assume that:  
(a)  the  input  resistance  (i.e.  the  resistance  that 
appears  between  the  inverting  and  non-inverting 
input terminals, RIC) is infinite
