where wi and wj are the sizes of wires i and j (wi, wj > 0), fij is
the unit length fringing capacitance between wires i and j,
lij
is the overlap length of wires i and j, and dij is the distance
from the center line of wire i to the center of wire j. Because the
nets are routed at most one bend, they have minimum wire
