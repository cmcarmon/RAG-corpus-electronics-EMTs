A permanent-magnet moving-coil movement is based upon a fixed permanent magnet and a coil of
wire which is able to move, as in figure 1-4. When the switch is closed, causing current through the coil,
the coil will have a magnetic field which will react to the magnetic field of the permanent magnet. The
bottom portion of the coil in figure 1-4 will be the north pole of this electromagnet. Since opposite poles
attract, the coil will move to the position shown in figure 1-5.
