Underwater Propagation
Speed/Velocity of Sound
Sound speed, c, in the ocean, in general lies between 1450–1540 m/s and varies as a function of several physical
parameters,  such  as  temperature,  salinity,  and  pressure  (depth).  Variations  in  sound  speed  can  signiﬁcantly
affect the propagation (range or quality) of sound in the ocean. Table 19.1 gives approximate expressions for
sound speed as a function of these physical parameters.
