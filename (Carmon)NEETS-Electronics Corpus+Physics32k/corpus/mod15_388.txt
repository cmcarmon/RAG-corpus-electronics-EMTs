When velocity remains constant, the brush spring holds the mass at null, and the brush rests on the 
reset contact of the switch. As acceleration occurs, the tendency of the mass to remain at a constant 
velocity causes the spring to compress. As the spring compresses, it allows the brush to move off the reset 
contact. If the acceleration is great enough, the brush will pass over the switch contacts for acceleration 
levels 1, 2, 3, and 4. These levels are determined by the stiffness of the spring.
