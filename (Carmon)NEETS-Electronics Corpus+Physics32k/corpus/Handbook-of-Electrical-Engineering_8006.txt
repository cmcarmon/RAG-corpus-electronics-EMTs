The yearly compendium of 
P/
C chips [Markowitz, 1997] categorizes these chips by the width of the data
path:  4,  8,  16,  32,  and  64  bits.  In  addition,  high-performance  chips  include  bit/word  slice  chipsâ€”these  are
meant to implement the functions of a central processing unit for a limited number of bits (4 or 8 bits) and
are meant to be concatenated for handling an entire computer word. For a discussion of these chips and their
uses, see Mick and Brick [1980].
