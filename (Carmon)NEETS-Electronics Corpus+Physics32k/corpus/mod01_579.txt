where: Ia, Ib, etc., are the currents entering and leaving the junction. Currents ENTERING the
junction are considered to be POSITIVE and currents LEAVING the junction are considered to be
NEGATIVE. When solving a problem using Kirchhoffâ€™s current law, the currents must be placed into the
equation WITH THE PROPER POLARITY SIGNS ATTACHED.
