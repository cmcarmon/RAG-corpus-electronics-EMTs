Automatic switches are not always as simple as the examples given above. Limit switches, which
sense some limit such as fluid level, mechanical movement, pressure (altitude or depth under water), or an
electrical quantity, are automatic switches. Computers use and control automatic switches that are
sometimes quite complicated.
