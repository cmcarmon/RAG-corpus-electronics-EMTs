In the design of machinery, one of the most difﬁcult factors to cope with is alternating fatigue-producing
stresses that occur at some parts of the machine. It has long been the custom to measure stress in equipment
with bonded strain gauges to predict the failure limits before actual failure occurs. This had only been possible
on those portions of the equipment that could be connected by wires. With radio telemetry, it is not possible
on all members. Costly fatigue failures are now avoidable through installation of miniature telemetry compo-
nents that are reliable, rugged, and accurate in heretofore inaccessible locations and environments. Industrial
uses are virtually limitless; systems can be built to speciﬁcations and encapsulated to withstand the most adverse
conditions.  Low-cost  measurement  and  telemetry  systems  have  been  applied  to  read  internal  vibrations  and
strain in rotating equipment, chains, vehicles, and projectiles—eliminating slip rings and wires. Measurement
can  be  made  under  operating  conditions  of  vibration,  acceleration,  strain,  temperature,  pressure,  magnetic
ﬁelds, electrical current, and voltage, under such adverse conditions as in a ﬁeld of high electrical potential, in
ﬂuids, in steam, or in high-velocity gases.
