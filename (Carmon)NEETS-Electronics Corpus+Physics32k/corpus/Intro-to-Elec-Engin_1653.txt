Steady-State Error of Linear Systems
If the steady-state response of the output does not agree exactly with the steady state of the input,
the system is said to have a steady-state error. Steady-state errors in practical control systems are
almost unavoidable because of friction, other imperfections, and the nature of the system. The
objective is then to keep the error to a minimum, or below a certain value. The steady-state error
is a measure of system accuracy when a speciÔ¨Åc type of input is applied to a control system.
