DNSS points arise in optimal control problems that exhibit multiple optimal solutions. A DNSS point is an indifference point in an optimal control problem such that starting from such a point, the problem has more than one different optimal solutions. Suresh P. Sethi identified such indifference points for the first time in 1977.
