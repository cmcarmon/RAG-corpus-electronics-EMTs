The Ep - Ip characteristic for a given diode, is determined by design engineers using mathematical
analysis and laboratory experiment. You, as a technician, will never need to do this. However, you will
use the results obtained by the engineers. You will also use your knowledge of the diode as you analyze
equipment malfunction.
