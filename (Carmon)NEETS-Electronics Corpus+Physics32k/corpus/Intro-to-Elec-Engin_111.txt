An electromechanical voltmeter with internal resistance of 1 k and an electronic voltmeter with
internal resistance of 10 M are used separately to measure the potential difference between A
and the ground of the circuit shown in Figure E1.4.1. Calculate the voltages that will be indicated
by each of the two instruments and the percentage error in each case.
