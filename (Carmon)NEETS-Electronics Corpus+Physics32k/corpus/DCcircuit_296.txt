Notice that in this condition, 20 volts is enough to produce a current of 20 milliamps through
a person: enough to induce tetanus. Remember, it has been suggested a current of only 17
milliamps may induce ventricular (heart) ﬁbrillation. With a hand-to-hand resistance of 1000
Ω, it would only take 17 volts to create this dangerous condition:
