The relativistic four-velocity, that is the four-vector representing velocity in relativity, is defined as follows:






U


=

X

=

(

)



{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\mathbf {U} }}={\frac {d{\boldsymbol {\mathbf {X} }}}{d\tau }}=\left({\frac {cdt}{d\tau }},{\frac {d\mathbf {x} }{d\tau }}\right)}

In the above, τ is the proper time of the path through spacetime, called the world-line, followed by the object velocity the above represents, and






X


=
(
c
t
,

x

)


{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\mathbf {X} }}=(ct,\mathbf {x} )}

is the four-position; the coordinates of an event. Due to time dilation, the proper time is the time between two events in a frame of reference where they take place at the same location. The proper time is related to coordinate time t by:

γ

{\displaystyle {\frac {d\tau }{dt}}={\frac {1}{\gamma (\mathbf {v} )}}}

where γ(v) is the Lorentz factor:

{\displaystyle \gamma (\mathbf {v} )={\frac {1}{\sqrt {1-\mathbf {v} \cdot \mathbf {v} /c^{2}}}}\,\rightleftharpoons \,\gamma (v)={\frac {1}{\sqrt {1-(v/c)^{2}}}}.}

(either version may be quoted) so it follows:






U

γ

{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\mathbf {U} }}=\gamma (\mathbf {v} )(c,\mathbf {v} )}

The first three terms, excepting the factor of γ(v), is the velocity as seen by the observer in their own reference frame. The γ(v) is determined by the velocity v between the observer's reference frame and the object's frame, which is the frame in which its proper time is measured. This quantity is invariant under Lorentz transformation, so to check to see what an observer in a different reference frame sees, one simply multiplies the velocity four-vector by the Lorentz transformation matrix between the two reference frames.
