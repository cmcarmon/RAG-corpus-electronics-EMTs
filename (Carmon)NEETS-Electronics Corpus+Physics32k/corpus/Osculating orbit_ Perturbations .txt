Perturbations that cause an object's osculating orbit to change can arise from:
A non-spherical component to the central body (when the central body can be modeled neither with a point mass nor with a spherically symmetrical mass distribution, e.g. when it is an oblate spheroid).
A third body or multiple other bodies whose gravity perturbs the object's orbit, for example the effect of the Moon's gravity on objects orbiting Earth.
A relativistic correction.
A non-gravitational force acting on the body, for example force arising from:
Thrust from a rocket engine
Releasing, leaking, venting or ablation of a material
Collisions with other objects
Atmospheric drag
Radiation pressure
Solar wind pressure
Switch to a non-inertial reference frame (e.g. when a satellite's orbit is described in a reference frame associated with the precessing equator of the planet).
