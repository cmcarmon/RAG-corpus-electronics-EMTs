For any given time, each ionospheric layer has a maximum frequency at which radio waves can be 
transmitted vertically and refracted back to Earth. This frequency is known as the CRITICAL 
FREQUENCY. It is a term that you will hear frequently in any discussion of radio wave propagation. 
Radio waves transmitted at frequencies higher than the critical frequency of a given layer will pass 
through the layer and be lost in space; but if these same waves enter an upper layer with a higher critical 
frequency, they will be refracted back to Earth. Radio waves of frequencies lower than the critical 
frequency will also be refracted back to Earth unless they are absorbed or have been refracted from a
