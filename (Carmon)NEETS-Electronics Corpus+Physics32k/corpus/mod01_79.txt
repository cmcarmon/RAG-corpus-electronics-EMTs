In addition to being numbered, the shells are also given letter designations, as pictured in figure 1-3.
Starting with the shell closest to the nucleus and progressing outward, the shells are labeled K, L, M, N,
O, P, and Q, respectively. The shells are considered to be full, or complete, when they contain the
following quantities of electrons: two in the K shell, eight in the L shell, 18 in the M shell, and so on, in
accordance with the exclusion principle. Each of these shells is a major shell and can be divided into
subshells, of which there are four, labeled s, p, d, and f. Like the major shells, the subshells are also
limited as to the number of electrons which they can contain. Thus, the "s" subshell is complete when it
contains two electrons, the "p" subshell when it contains 10, and the "f" subshell when it contains 14
electrons.
