A particular choice of a logic technology involves a compromise of many practical charac-
teristics. The power-delay product (PDP) is the approximate energy consumed by a gate every
time its output is switched, and it forms a general ﬁgure of merit. PDP is the product of Pav, the
average dc power consumed by the gate, and TD, the gate’s propagation delay. It is the energy
required to effect a single change, since TD is the time required for a single change of logic state,
and is a measure of the electrical efﬁciency of the switch.
