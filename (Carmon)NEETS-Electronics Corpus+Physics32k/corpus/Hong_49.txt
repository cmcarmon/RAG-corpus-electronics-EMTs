The ideas of electrical source and load are extremely useful constructs in circuit 
analysis since all electronic circuits can be modeled as a source circuit, a load circuit, or 
some combination of the two. Source circuits are circuits that supply energy while load 
circuits are circuits that dissipate energy. Load circuits can be simply modeled by a single 
equivalent  impedance,  while  source  circuits  can  be  modeled  as  a  voltage  or  current 
source plus an equivalent impedance. This section describes the properties of practical 
voltage and current sources; how to represent the output of arbitrary circuits as source 
circuits; and how the source and load model of electronic circuits can be used to model 
circuit behavior.
