The spherical symmetry of the Schwarzschild metric for non-spinning black holes allows one to reduce the problem of finding the trajectories of particles to three dimensions. In this case one only needs



E


{\displaystyle E}
,




L

z




{\displaystyle L_{z}}
, and



m


{\displaystyle m}
to determine the motion; however, the symmetry leading to Carter's constant still exists. Carter's constant for Schwarzschild space is:




C
=

p

+


(



L

z



sin

θ



)


2




{\displaystyle C=p_{\theta }^{2}+\left({\frac {L_{z}}{\sin \theta }}\right)^{2}}
.

By a rotation of coordinates we can put any orbit in the



θ
=
π

/

2


{\displaystyle \theta =\pi /2}
plane so




p

θ


=
0


{\displaystyle p_{\theta }=0}
. In this case



C
=

L

z

{\displaystyle C=L_{z}^{2}}
, the square of the orbital angular momentum.
