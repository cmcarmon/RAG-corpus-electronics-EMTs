Figure 3-11 shows three single-phase transformers connected wye-wye. Again, note that the
transformer windings are not angled. Electrically, a Y is formed by the connections. The lower
connections of each winding are shorted together. These form the common point of the wye. The opposite
end of each winding is isolated. These ends form the arms of the wye.
