If the potentiometer arm is moved at the same rate in the opposite direction, the right plate will
decrease in positive potential until the beam returns to the 0 position. At that point, the potential
difference between the plates is again zero. Moving the arm toward the other end of the resistance causes
the left plate to become more positive than the right, and the beam moves from screen points 0 through 4.
If the movement of the potentiometer arm is at a uniform (linear) rate, the beam moves at a uniform rate.
