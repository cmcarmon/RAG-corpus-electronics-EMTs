PV  applications  range  from  milliwatts  (consumer  electronics)  to  megawatts  (central  station  plants).  They
are suitable for portable, remote, stand-alone, and utility-interactive applications. PV systems should be con-
sidered as energy sources and their design should maximize the conversion of insolation into useable electrical
form. Power requirements of practical loads are met using an energy storage and reconversion system or utility
interconnection. Concentrating systems have been designed and operated to provide both electrical and low-
grade thermal outputs with combined peak utilization efÔ¨Åciencies approaching 60%.
