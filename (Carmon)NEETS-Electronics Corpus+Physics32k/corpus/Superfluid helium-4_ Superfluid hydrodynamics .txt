{\displaystyle {\vec {F}}=M_{4}{\frac {\mathrm {d} {\vec {v}}_{s}}{\mathrm {d} t}}.}

The mass M4 is the molar mass of 4He and

{\displaystyle {\vec {v}}_{s}}
is the velocity of the superfluid component. The time derivative is the so-called hydrodynamic derivative, i.e. the rate of increase of the velocity when moving with the fluid. In the case of superfluid 4He in the gravitational field the force is given by

{\displaystyle {\vec {F}}=-{\vec {\nabla }}(\mu +M_{4}gz).}

In this expression μ is the molar chemical potential, g the gravitational acceleration, and z the vertical coordinate. Thus we get

Eq.(1) only holds if vs is below a certain critical value which usually is determined by the diameter of the flow channel.
In classical mechanics the force is often the gradient of a potential energy. Eq.(1) shows that, in the case of the superfluid component, the force contains a term due to the gradient of the chemical potential. This is the origin of the remarkable properties of He-II such as the fountain effect.
