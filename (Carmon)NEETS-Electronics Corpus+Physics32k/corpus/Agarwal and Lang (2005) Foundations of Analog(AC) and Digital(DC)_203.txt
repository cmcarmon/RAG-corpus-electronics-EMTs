Thus far, we have invented four ideal, primitive elements and studied their
v i characteristics. These ideal elements included the independent voltage
source, the independent current source, the linear resistor, and the perfect con-
ductor. Let us now return to building models for some of the physical elements
we have seen thus far in terms of the four ideal elements.
