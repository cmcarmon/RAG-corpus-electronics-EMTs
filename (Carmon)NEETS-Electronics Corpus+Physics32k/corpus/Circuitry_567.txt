Example 12.1 
 
Design  a  timer  circuit  that  will  produce  a  10  ms 
pulse  when  a  negative-going  trigger  pulse  is 
applied to it. 
 
Solution 
 
Using  the  circuit  shown  in  Fig.  12.4,  the  value  of 
monostable  timing  period  can  be  calculated  from 
the formula: 
 
ton = 1.1 C R
We need to choose an appropriate value for C that 
is  in  the  range  stated  earlier.  Since  we  require  a 
fairly  modest  time  period  we  will  choose  a  mid-
range value for C. This should help to ensure that 
the value of R is neither too small nor too large. A 
value of 100 nF  should be appropriate and should 
also be easy to obtain. Making R the subject of the 
formula and substituting for C = 100 nF gives:
