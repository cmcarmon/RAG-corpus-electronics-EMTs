With increasing collector current density, so called high-
current effects (e.g., high-injection in the collector region)
occur, leading to additional charge storage (Kirk, 1962; Schro¨ter
and Lee, 1999). Figure 5.8(B) contains typical characteristics of
the transit time tf ¼ tf 0(VC0B0 ) þ Dtf (IC, VC0E0 ) as a function
of collector current density. The sharp increase of tf due to
high-current effects can be described by a critical current ICK
(Schro¨ter and Walkey, 1996) that also serves as a useful aid
for designing high-speed switching circuits (Rein, In press).
A rough approximation of the corresponding maximum value
increase is Dtf , max  wC (wBm þ wC=2)=(2DnC ).
of
(Kirk, 1962). Beyond ICK , a drop in current gain and transit
frequency fT also occur. The latter can be used to determine
tf (IC, VC0E0 ). (Rein, 1983). The total minority charge for for-
ward also operation is given by Qf (IC , VC0E0 ) ¼
0 tf di (¼ area
under the tf curve), from which the BE diffusion capacitance
can be calculated as CdE ¼ qQf =qVB0E0 ¼ tf gm with the trans-
conductance gm ¼ qIT =qVB0E0 at constant VC0E0 .
