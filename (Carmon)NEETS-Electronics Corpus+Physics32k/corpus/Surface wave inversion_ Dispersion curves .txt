The process of creating dispersion curves from raw surface wave data (distance vs. time plot) can be performed using five transformation processes. The first is known as the wave-field transformation (τ-p transformation), first performed by McMechan and Yedlin (1981). The second is a 2-dimensional wave-field transform (f-k transformation) performed by Yilmaz (1987). The third is a wave-field transform base on phase shift, performed by Park et al. (1998). The fourth is a modified wave-field transform base on frequency decomposition and slant stacking, performed by Xia et al. (2007). The fifth is a high-resolution Linear Radon transformation performed by Luo et al. (2008). In performing a wave-field transformation, a slant stack is done, followed by a Fourier transform. The way in which a Fourier transform changes x-t data into x-ω (ω is angular frequency) data shows why phase velocity dominates surface wave inversion theory. Phase velocity is the velocity of each wave with a given frequency. The modified wavefield transform is executed by doing a Fourier transform first before a slant stack. Slant stacking is a process by which x-t (where x is the offset distance, and t is the time) data is transformed into slowness versus time space. A linear move (similar to normal move out (NMO)) out is applied to the raw data. For each line on a seismic plot, there will be a move out that can be applied that will make that line horizontal. Distances are integrated for each slowness and time composition. This is known as a slant stack because each value for slowness represents a slant in x-t space and the integration stacks these values for each slowness.
