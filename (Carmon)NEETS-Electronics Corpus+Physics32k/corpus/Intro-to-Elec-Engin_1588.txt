A motor operates in two modesâ€”motoring and braking. Supporting its motion, it converts
electric energy to mechanical energy while motoring. In braking, while opposing the motion, it
works as a generator converting mechanical energy to electric energy, which is consumed in some
part of the circuit. The motor can provide motoring and braking operations in both forward and
reverse directions. Figure 16.1.2 illustrates the four-quadrant operation of drives. The continuous
as well as the transient torque and power limitations of a drive in the four quadrants of operation
