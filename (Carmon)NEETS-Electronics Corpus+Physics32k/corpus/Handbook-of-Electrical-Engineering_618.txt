The simplest realistic model of the channel is a linear bandpass channel with additive white Gaussian noise
(AWGN). A block diagram of the bandpass AWGN channel model that is considered throughout this section
and the next is shown in Fig. 5.24. The additive noise is characterized by its power spectral density No.
