In addition to fiber attenuation and dispersion, other optical fiber properties affect system
performance. Fiber properties, such as modal noise, pulse broadening, and polarization, can reduce
system performance. Modal noise, pulse broadening, and polarization are too complex to discuss as
introductory level material. However, you should be aware that attenuation and dispersion are not the
only fiber properties that affect performance.
