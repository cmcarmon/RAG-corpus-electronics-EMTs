The main reason for introducing differential relaying is the
ability to provide 100% protection of transmission lines; at the
same time, the inﬂuence of the rest of the system is minimal.
The scheme has primarily been used for high-voltage trans-
mission lines that have a strategic importance or have some
difﬁcult application requirements such as series compensation
or multiterminal conﬁguration. The use of a communication
system is needed for implementation of this approach. This
may be considered a disadvantage due to the increased cost
and possibility for the channel malfunctioning.
