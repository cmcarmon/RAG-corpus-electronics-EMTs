resistive adding circuit is shown in Figure 3.44a. This circuit might be used to add
together a number of microphone signals before sending them to one amplifier. (Notice
that this circuit is a generalization of the circuit in Figure 3.36.) We shall discover better
ways of building such a circuit in later chapters, but the present form serves as a good
illustration of the principle of superposition.
