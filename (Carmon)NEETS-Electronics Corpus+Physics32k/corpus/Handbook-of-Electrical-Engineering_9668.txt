Constructions
Message  authentication  schemes  can  be  constructed  using  pseudorandom  functions.  However,  as  noted  by
Bellare,  Canetti,  and  Krawczyk  [1996],  extensive  usage  of  pseudorandom  functions  seems  an  overkill  for
achieving message authentication, and more efÔ¨Åcient schemes can be obtained based on other cryptographic
primitives.
