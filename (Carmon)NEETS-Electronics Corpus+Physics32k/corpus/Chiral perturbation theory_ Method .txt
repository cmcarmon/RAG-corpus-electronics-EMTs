According to Steven Weinberg, an effective theory can be useful if one writes down all terms consistent with the symmetries of the parent theory. In general there are an infinite number of terms which meet this requirement. Therefore in order to make any physical predictions, one assigns to the theory a power-ordering scheme which organizes terms by some pre-determined degree of importance. The ordering allows one to keep some terms and omit all other, higher-order corrections which can be safely, temporarily ignored.
There are several power counting schemes in ChPT. The most widely used one is the



p


{\displaystyle p}
-expansion. However, there also exist the



ϵ


{\displaystyle \epsilon }
,



δ
,


{\displaystyle \delta ,}
and




ϵ

′




{\displaystyle \epsilon ^{\prime }}
expansions. All of these expansions are valid in finite volume, (though the



p


{\displaystyle p}
expansion is the only one valid in infinite volume.) Particular choices of finite volumes require one to use different reorganizations of the chiral theory in order to correctly understand the physics. These different reorganizations correspond to the different power counting schemes.
In addition to the ordering scheme, most terms in the approximate Lagrangian will be multiplied by coupling constants which represent the relative strengths of the force represented by each term. Values of these constants – also called low-energy constants or LECs – are usually not known. The constants can be determined by fitting to experimental data or be derived from underlying theory.
