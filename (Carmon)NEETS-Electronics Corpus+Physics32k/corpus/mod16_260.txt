Figure 2-12 shows a typical CAVITY WAVEMETER. The wavemeter is of the type commonly used
for the measurement of microwave frequencies. The device uses a resonant cavity. The resonant
frequency of the cavity is varied by means of a plunger, which is mechanically connected to a micrometer
mechanism. Movement of the plunger into the cavity reduces the cavity size and increases the resonant
frequency. Conversely, an increase in the size of the cavity (made by withdrawing the plunger) lowers the
resonant frequency. The microwave energy from the equipment being tested is fed into the wavemeter
through one of two inputs, A or B. The crystal rectifier then detects (rectifies) the signal. The rectified
current is indicated on current meter M.
