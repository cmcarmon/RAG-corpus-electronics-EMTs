The SYNCHRO CAPACITOR is a unit containing three delta-connected capacitors. It is used in 
synchro systems containing either differential transmitters or CTs. The addition of the synchro capacitor 
to these systems greatly reduces the stator current and therefore increases the accuracy of the systems.
