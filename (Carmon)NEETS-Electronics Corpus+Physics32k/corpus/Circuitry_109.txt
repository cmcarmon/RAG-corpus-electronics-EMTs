Example 2.23 
 
A monolithic ceramic capacitor is marked with the 
legend ‘103K’. What is its value? 
 
Solution 
 
The value (pF) will be given by the first two digits 
(10) followed by the number of zeros indicated by 
the third digit (3). The value of the capacitor is thus 
10,000  pF  or  10  nF.  The  final  letter  (K)  indicates 
that the capacitor has a tolerance of 10%.
