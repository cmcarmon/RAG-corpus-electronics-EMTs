Transient Stability
Assume that the power system is operating at a small-signal
stable equilibrium point. Suppose the system is suddenly sub-
ject to a large disturbance such as a line fault. Then, the power
system protective relays will detect the fault, and they will
isolate the faulty portion of the network by possibly tripping
some lines. The occurrence of fault and the subsequent line
trippings will cause the system response to move away from
the equilibrium condition. After the fault has been cleared, the
ability of the system to return to nominal equilibrium condi-
tion is called the transient stability for that fault scenario. We
will study a transient stability example for the simple system in
Figure 7.16.
