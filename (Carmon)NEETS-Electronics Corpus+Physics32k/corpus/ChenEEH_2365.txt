where l0 is the free space wavelength (l0 ¼ c=f ). There are
different methods for determining eff and C. Of course,
closed-form expressions are of great importance in microstrip
line design. The evaluation of eff and C based on a quasi-TEM
approximation is accurate for design at lower microwave fre-
quencies. At higher microwave frequencies, however, the lon-
gitudinal components of
the electromagnetic ﬁelds are
signiﬁcant, and the quasi-TEM assumption is no longer
valid. A useful set of relations for the characteristic impedance,
assuming zero or negligible thickness of the strip conductor
(i.e., t=h < 0:005), is provided here (Bahl, 1977):
