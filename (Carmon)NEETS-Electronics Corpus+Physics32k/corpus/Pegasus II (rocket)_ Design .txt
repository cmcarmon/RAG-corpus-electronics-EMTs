The Stratolaunch carrier aircraft will be able to take-off from airfields with a runway at least 3,700 m (12,100 feet) in length and will be able to travel up to 2,200 km (1,200 nautical miles) before releasing the Pegasus II at an altitude of 9,100 m (30,000 feet). The system will be the largest aircraft ever built in terms of wingspan; with the first test flight of the carrier aircraft expected in 2015 from Scaled Composites' facilities in Mojave, California, and the first test launch of the rocket not expected before 2016.
The first two stages of the Pegasus II will have the same outside diameter as the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster, but will be constructed using much lighter carbon-composite cases and contain a more energetic propellant mix. To provide guidance while in the atmosphere, the first stage will be equipped with two wings and a V-tail, both with control surfaces. Additionally, both the first and second stage motors will use a thrust vector control (TVC) system for attitude control in the thin upper atmosphere.
The third stage was originally intended to be a restartable cryogenic stage burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. Missions to LEO would have featured a 5 m (16 ft)-diameter payload fairing and two Aerojet Rocketdyne RL10 engines, with a payload capacity of 6,120 kg (13,500 lb). GTO missions would have used a 4 m (13 ft) meter fairing and a single RL10 engine, with a payload capacity of approximately 2,000 kilograms (4,500 lb). This vehicle would have had a gross weight of about 211,000 kg (465,000 pounds).
Development of the cryogenic third stage was halted in 2014, and ATK was asked to evaluate a replacement consisting of two solid stages. In November of that year, Stratolaunch confirmed that Pegasus II would be an all-solid vehicle.
