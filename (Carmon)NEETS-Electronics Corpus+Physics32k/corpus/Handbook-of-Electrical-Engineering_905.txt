Transient Analysis
Transient analysis is the most powerful analysis capability of a simulator because the transient response is so
hard to calculate analytically. Transient analysis can be used for many types of analysis, such as switching speed,
distortion, basic operation of certain circuits like switching power supplies. Transient analysis is also the most
CPU intensive and can require 100 or 1000 times the CPU time as a DC or AC analysis.
