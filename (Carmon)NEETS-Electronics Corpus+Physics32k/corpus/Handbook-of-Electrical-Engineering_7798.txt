A fraction of the disk surface area is usually reserved for preformat information and cannot be used for data
storage. Also, prior to recording, additional bits are generally added to the data for  error correction coding
and other housekeeping chores. These constitute a certain amount of overhead on the user data and must be
allowed for in determining the capacity. A good rule of thumb is that overhead consumes approximately 20%
of the raw capacity of an optical disk, although the exact number may vary among the systems in use. Substrate
defects  and  ﬁlm  contaminants  during  the  deposition  process  can  create  bad  sectors  on  the  disk.  These  are
typically identiﬁed during the certiﬁcation process and are marked for elimination from the sector directory.
Needless to say, bad sectors must be discounted when evaluating the capacity.
