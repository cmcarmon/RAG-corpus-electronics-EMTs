The United Kingdom roll-out is considered to be the largest programme ever undertaken, involving visits to 30 million homes and 2 million small businesses to replace meters for both gas and electricity. Most households will have smart meters installed by their energy company before 2020. At the end of 2013 there were 295,700 smart meters installed in domestic properties in Great Britain. In March 2016, figures released by the Department for Energy and Climate Change, showed that only 2.3 million smart meters had been installed in UK homes. This was well behind schedule to hit the governmentâ€™s target to have 50 million in place by 2020.
