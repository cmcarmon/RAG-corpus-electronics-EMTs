Since ship service power distribution systems are designed to be ungrounded, many persons believe
it is safe to touch one conductor, since no electrical current would flow. This is not true, since the
distribution system is not totally isolated from the hull of the ship. If one conductor of an ungrounded
electrical system is touched while the body is in contact with the hull of the ship or other metal equipment
enclosure, a fatal electric current may pass through the body. ALL LIVE ELECTRIC CIRCUITS SHALL
BE TREATED AS POTENTIAL HAZARDS AT ALL TIMES.
