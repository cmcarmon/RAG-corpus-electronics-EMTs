Since the circumplex model of group tasks is quite detailed and complex, numerous social psychological researchers have attempted to describe the model in various ways to ensure readers obtain an optimal understanding of the model. For instance, according to Stratus and McGrath (1994), the four quadrants and the various task types with which they contain all relate to one another within a two-dimensional space. More specifically, Stratus and McGrath (1994) states that the horizontal dimension of the circumplex model of group tasks visual representation reflect the extent to which a task entails cognitive versus behavioural performance requirements. Likewise, the vertical dimension of the circumplex model of group tasks visual representation reflects the extent and form of interdependence among members.
