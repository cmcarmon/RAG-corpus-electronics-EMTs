Nuclear entombment (also referred to as "safe enclosure") is entombment of a radioactive site and a method of nuclear decommissioning in which radioactive contaminants are encased in a structurally long-lived material, such as concrete. The idea is that the entombment will last for a period of time to ensure the remaining radioactivity is no longer of significant concern. The method has usually been used in relation to nuclear reactors, but also in relation to some nuclear test sites. Regarding decommission of nuclear power plants, entombment is one of three various ways: dismantling, safe enclosure and entombment. Nuclear entombment is the least used of the three options. The use of nuclear entombment is more practical for larger nuclear power plants that are in need of both long and short term burials. Entombment is used as a case by case basis because of its major commitment with years of surveillance and complexity until the radioactivity is no longer a major concern, permitting decommissioning and ultimate unrestricted release of the property.
