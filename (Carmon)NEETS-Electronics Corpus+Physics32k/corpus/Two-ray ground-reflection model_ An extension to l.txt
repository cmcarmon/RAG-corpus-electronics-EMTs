The above approximations are valid provided that



d
≫
(

h

t


+

h

r


)


{\displaystyle d\gg (h_{t}+h_{r})}
, which may be not the case in many scenarios, e.g. when antenna heights are not much smaller compared to the distance, or when the ground cannot be modelled as an ideal plane . In this case, one cannot use



Γ
≈
−
1


{\displaystyle \Gamma \approx -1}
and more refined analysis is required, see e.g. .
