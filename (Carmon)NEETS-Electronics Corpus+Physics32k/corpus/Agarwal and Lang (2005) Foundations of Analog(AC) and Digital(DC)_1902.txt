We first construct the small-signal circuit model for the first stage including
the load capacitor. We can ignore the loading of the second stage because the
MOSFET has an infinite input resistance. It is easy to see that the small-signal
circuit model can be developed from the circuit in Figure 8.16 by adding the
load capacitor CGS as illustrated in Figure 13.20.
