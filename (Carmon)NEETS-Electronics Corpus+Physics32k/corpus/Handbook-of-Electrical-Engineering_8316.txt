respond  to  the  test  pattern.  Thus,  the  ATPG  programs  assume  that  the  internal  ﬂip-ﬂop  clock  inputs  are
controlled directly from an external pin of the component. This very desirable characteristic is often expressed
by stating that externally applied clock pulses are not allowed to be gated by other signals before these reach the
clock  terminals  of  the  internal  ﬂip-ﬂops.  A  side  beneﬁt  of  this  design  rule  is  that  it  prevents  glitches  (i.e.,
undesirable pulses) which might be generated at the ﬂip-ﬂop clock terminals due to changing the other inputs
to the clock gating circuit while the clock pulse is present.
