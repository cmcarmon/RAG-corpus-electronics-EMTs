Figure 2-10 is a block diagram of a typical power-amplifier transmitter system. In this transmitter
system a multicavity klystron tube amplifies lower-powered rf pulses that have been generated and
shaped in other stages. CROSSED-FIELD AMPLIFIERS (AMPLITRONS) are used in radar systems
with a wide band of transmitted frequencies because they are stable over a wider frequency range. A
crossed-field amplifier transmitter is discussed later in this section.
