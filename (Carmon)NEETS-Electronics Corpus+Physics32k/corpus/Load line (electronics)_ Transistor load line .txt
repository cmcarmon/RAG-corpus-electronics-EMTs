The load line diagram at right is for a resistive load in a common emitter circuit. The load line shows how the collector load resistor (RL) constrains the circuit voltage and current. The diagram also plots the transistor's collector current IC versus collector voltage VCE for different values of base current Ibase. The intersections of the load line with the transistor characteristic curves represent the circuit-constrained values of IC and VCE at different base currents.
If the transistor could pass all the current available, with no voltage dropped across it, the collector current would be the supply voltage V CC over RL. This is the point where the load line crosses the vertical axis. Even at saturation, however, there will always be some voltage from collector to emitter.
Where the load line crosses the horizontal axis, the transistor current is minimum (approximately zero). The transistor is said to be cut off, passing only a very small leakage current, and so very nearly the entire supply voltage appears as VCE.
The operating point of the circuit in this configuration (labelled Q) is generally designed to be in the active region, approximately in the middle of the load line for amplifier applications. Adjusting the base current so that the circuit is at this operating point with no signal applied is called biasing the transistor. Several techniques are used to stabilize the operating point against minor changes in temperature or transistor operating characteristics. When a signal is applied, the base current varies, and the collector-emitter voltage in turn varies, following the load line - the result is an amplifier stage with gain.
A load line is normally drawn on Ic-Vce characteristics curves for the transistor used in an amplifier circuit. The same technique is applied to other types of non-linear elements such as vacuum tubes or field effect transistors.
