Shorts occur in many components, such as transformers, motor windings, and capacitors. The major
test method used to detect shorts in such components is to measure resistance. The indicated resistance is
then compared with the resistance given on schematics or in the equipment technical manuals to
determine whether the measured value is within specifications.
