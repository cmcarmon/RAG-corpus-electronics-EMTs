Thus, radiometry is optimum in the case in which both signal and noise are i.i.d. Gaussian sequences with
zero means. Since in this case the presence of the signal is manifested only by an increase in energy level, it is
intuitively obvious that radiometry is the only way of detecting the signalâ€™s presence. More generally, when the
signal is correlated, the quadratic function (73.13) exploits both the increased energy level and the correlation
structure introduced by the presence of the signal. For example, if the signal is a narrowband Gaussian process,
then the quadratic function (73.13) acts as a narrowband radiometer with bandpass characteristic that approx-
imately  matches  that  of  the  signal.  In  general,  the  quadratic  detector  will  make  use  of  whatever  spectral
properties the signal exhibits.
