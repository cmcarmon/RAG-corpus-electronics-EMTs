1.7.2 Electricity Bills
The second application deals with how an electric utility company charges
their  customers.  The  cost  of  electricity  depends  upon  the  amount  of
energy consumed in kilowatt-hours (kWh). (Other factors that affect the
cost  include  demand  and  power  factors;  we  will  ignore  these  for  now.)
However, even if a consumer uses no energy at all, there is a minimum
service charge the customer must pay because it costs money to stay con-
nected to the power line. As energy consumption increases, the cost per
kWh drops. It is interesting to note the average monthly consumption of
household appliances for a family of Ô¨Åve, shown in Table 1.3.
