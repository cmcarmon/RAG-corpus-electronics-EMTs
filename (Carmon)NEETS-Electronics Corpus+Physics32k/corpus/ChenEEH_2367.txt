The restrictions t < h and t < W =2 are usually satisﬁed be-

t ¼ 0:002 in. The formulas presented thus far are valid at
frequencies where the quasi-TEM assumption can be made.
When the quasi-TEM assumption is not valid, eff and Z0 are
functions of frequency and, therefore, the microstrip line be-
comes dispersive. The phase velocity of the microstrip line
decreases with increasing frequency. Therefore, eff (f ) increases
with frequency. Moreover, the characteristic impedance of the
microstrip line increases with frequency, and it follows that the
effective width Weff (f ) decreases. The frequency in equation
5.57, in which dispersion may be neglected, is given by:
