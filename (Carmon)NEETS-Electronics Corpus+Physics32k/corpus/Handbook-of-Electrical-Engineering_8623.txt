For the powerful but simple SPARC, the simple base-index form shown in 1.4 is all that you have (or need).
The double-indirect format, 1.5, is so rarely used that it has been left out of almost all designs but the VAX.
What makes it occasionally useful is that subroutines get pointers to “pass by pointer” variables. Thus, if you
want to get the variable, ﬁrst you must load the address and then the variable. The VAX allows you to do this
in one instruction. While that sounds compact, it is expensive in memory cycles. If you want to use that pointer
again, it pays to have it in register.
