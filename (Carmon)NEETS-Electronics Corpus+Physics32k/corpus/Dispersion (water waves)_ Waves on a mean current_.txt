Water waves on a mean flow (so a wave in a moving medium) experience a Doppler shift. Suppose the dispersion relation for a non-moving medium is:





ω

=

Ω

(
k
)
,



{\displaystyle \omega ^{2}=\Omega ^{2}(k),\,}

with k the wavenumber. Then for a medium with mean velocity vector V, the dispersion relationship with Doppler shift becomes:






(

ω

k

V



)


2


=

Ω

(
k
)
,


{\displaystyle \left(\omega -{\mathbf {k} }\cdot {\mathbf {V} }\right)^{2}=\Omega ^{2}(k),}

where k is the wavenumber vector, related to k as: k = |k|. The dot product k•V is equal to: k•V = kV cos α, with V the length of the mean velocity vector V: V = |V|. And α the angle between the wave propagation direction and the mean flow direction. For waves and current in the same direction, k•V=kV.
