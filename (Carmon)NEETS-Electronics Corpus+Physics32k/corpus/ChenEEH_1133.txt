The microaccelerometers are the best example of MEMS
components being employed for opportunistic applications.
The ability to measure tilt has led to their incorporation into
a sensor system for workers who have to lift heavy objects. If
the person bends his or her back excessively while lifting, the
system sounds a warning. MEMS accelerometers are being
used by researchers in sleep studies. A glove equipped with
such components on each Ô¨Ånger is under development as a
training aid for American Sign Language. Microaccelerometers
are being used for studies of other motions of the human body,
especially in sports. They are also being incorporated into
sports equipment, including golf clubs and tennis racquets.
Amateur scientists have used them to record accelerations
during roller-coaster rides and to make backyard seismom-
eters.
