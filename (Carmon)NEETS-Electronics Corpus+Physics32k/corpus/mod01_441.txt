This chapter also explains how to determine the total resistance, current, voltage, and power in a
series, parallel, or combination circuit through the use of Ohm’s and Kirchhoff’s laws. The voltage divider
network, series, parallel, and series-parallel practice problem circuits will be used for practical examples
of what you have learned.
