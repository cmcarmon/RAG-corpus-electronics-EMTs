According to Mitsubishi, AWC philosophy is put into practice by means of three forms of control:
The first form of control is control over the four tires’ vertical loading, by means of which each tire is kept in firm contact with the road surface for consistently maximum grip. The vehicle’s basic specifications and its body and suspension technologies are exploited for this purpose.
The second form of control is control over the four tires’ slip ratios and slip angles (control that is effected over the respective slip ratios and slip angles of the four tires such that the longitudinal and lateral forces produced by each of the four tires are maximized in a balanced manner). An anti-lock braking system (ABS), a traction control (TCL) system, and steering-system control technologies are exploited for this purpose.
The third form of control is control over the four tires’ force assignment (control that is effected over the distribution of longitudinal forces and lateral forces among the four tires such that the tires are uniformly loaded for well-balanced utilization). Powertrain and braking-system control technologies are exploited for this purpose.
