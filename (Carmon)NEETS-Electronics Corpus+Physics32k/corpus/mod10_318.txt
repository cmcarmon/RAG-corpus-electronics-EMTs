Man-made interference may come from several sources. Some of these sources, such as oscillators, 
communications transmitters, and radio transmitters, may be specifically designed to generate radio 
frequency energy. Some electrical devices also generate radio frequency energy, although they are not 
specifically designed for this purpose. Examples are ignition systems, generators, motors, switches, 
relays, and voltage regulators. The intensity of man-made interference may vary throughout the day and 
drop off to a low level at night when many of these sources are not being used. Man-made interference 
may be a critical limiting factor at radio receiving sites located near industrial areas.
