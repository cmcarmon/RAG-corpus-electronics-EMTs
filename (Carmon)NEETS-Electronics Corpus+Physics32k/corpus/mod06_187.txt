Before going on to the next section, there is one more thing of which you should be aware. Look
again at the waveforms of figure 1-19. Notice that the output voltage of the amplifier is 180ยบ out of phase
with the input voltage. You will find that this polarity inversion is a characteristic of any amplifier in
which the output is taken between the cathode and the plate. This is normal and should not confuse you
when you troubleshoot or work with this type of circuit.
