Viterbi Search
The Viterbi algorithm [11] introduced previously ﬁnds the most likely path through an HMM. Equation (15.66)
demands that we ﬁnd for each candidate word string W, the probability of the set of paths that corresponds to
the word string W and then identify the word string whose set of paths has the highest probability.
