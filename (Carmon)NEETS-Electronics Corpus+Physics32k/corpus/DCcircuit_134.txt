In the above circuit, there is only one source of voltage (the battery, on the left) and only one
source of resistance to current (the lamp, on the right). This makes it very easy to apply Ohm’s
Law. If we know the values of any two of the three quantities (voltage, current, and resistance)
in this circuit, we can use Ohm’s Law to determine the third.
