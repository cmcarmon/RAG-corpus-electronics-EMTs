In this scheme, a pre-cooled cloud of atoms (whose temperature is of a few tens of microkelvins) undergoes a series of pulses of Raman-like processes. The beams are counterpropagating, and their frequencies are just as what has been described above, except that the frequency




f

2




{\displaystyle f_{2}}
is now slightly red-detuned (detuning



Δ


{\displaystyle \Delta }
) with respect to its normal value. Thus, atoms moving towards the source of the laser 2 with a sufficient velocity will be resonant with the Raman pulses, thanks to the Doppler effect. They will be excited to the

g

⟩


{\displaystyle |g_{2}\rangle }
state, and get a momentum kick decreasing the modulus of their velocity.
If the propagation directions of the two lasers are interchanged, then the atoms moving in the opposite direction will be excited and get the momentum kick that will decrease the modulus of their velocities. By regularly exchanging the lasers propagating directions and varying the detuning

{\displaystyle \Delta }
, one can manage to have all atoms for which the initial velocity satisfies

{\displaystyle |g_{2}\rangle }
and

{\displaystyle |e\rangle }

By repeating this process several times (eight in the original paper, see references), the temperature of the cloud can be lowered to less than a microkelvin.
