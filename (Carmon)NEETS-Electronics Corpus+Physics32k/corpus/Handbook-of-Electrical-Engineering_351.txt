We  can  now  obtain  a  physical  interpretation  for  the  reactive  power.  When  the  power  factor  is  unity,  the
voltage and current are in phase and sin q = 0. Hence, the reactive power is zero. In this case, the instantaneous
power is never negative. This case is illustrated by the current, voltage, and power waveforms in Fig. 3.23; the
power curve never dips below the axis, and there is no exchange of energy between the source and the circuit.
At the other extreme, when the power factor is zero, the voltage and current are 90(cid:176) out of phase and sin q =
1. Now the reactive power is a maximum and the average power is zero. In this case, the instantaneous power
is positive over half a cycle (of the voltage) and negative over the other half. All the energy delivered by the
source over half a cycle is returned to the source by the circuit over the other half.
