The bar over the v represents root-mean-square (rms) values
per unit bandwidth. Let
the total noise–power per unit
bandwidth, delivered by the antenna to a conjugate-matched
load ZL ¼ Z
in be Pna. The respective constituent parts de-
livered by vnL and vnR are PnL and Pnr . These noise powers
can be expressed using the respective noise temperatures and
antenna radiation efﬁciency Zr (from equation 6.51), which
would then provide a relationship between Tea, Ta, and Ter :
