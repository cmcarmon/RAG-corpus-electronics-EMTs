WAVEGUIDE DUPLEXERS usually consist of tr tubes and atr tubes housed in a resonant cavity
and attached to a waveguide system in some manner. Resonant-cavity tr tubes may be applied to
waveguides, either directly or indirectly, to obtain switching action. The indirect method uses a coaxial
line system, and then couples the coaxial line into the waveguide that feeds the antenna. If large losses are
incurred by the use of a coaxial line, the resonant cavity can be coupled directly to the waveguide. Figure
2-20 shows a direct method of cavity tr switching in a waveguide system. The waveguide terminates in
the antenna at one end and in a shorting plate at the other. The magnetron uses a voltage probe to excite
the waveguide. The transmitted pulse travels up the guide and moves into the tr box through a slot. The
cavity builds up a strong electric field across the gap, breaks it down, and detunes the cavity. This action
effectively seals the opening and passes the pulse energy to the antenna.
