One purpose of this chapter is to acquaint you with the practical use of test equipment. The presence
of adequate test equipment in your shop is not in itself a "cure-all" for making repairs to complex
electronic equipment. You must know how to best use the equipment available. First, however, you must
understand the basis of electronic theory and be able to apply it to the system under repair.
