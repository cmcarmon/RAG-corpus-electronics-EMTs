A DRIVEN element is similar to the dipole you have been studying and is connected directly to the 
transmission line. It obtains its power directly from the transmitter or, as a receiving antenna, it delivers 
the received energy directly to the receiver. A PARASITIC ELEMENT is located near the driven element 
from which it gets its power. It is placed close enough to the driven element to permit coupling.
