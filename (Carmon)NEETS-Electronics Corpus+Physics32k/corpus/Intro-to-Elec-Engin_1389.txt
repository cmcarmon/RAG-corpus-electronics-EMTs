A good understanding of a communication system can be achieved by studying electro-
magnetic wave propagation (via transmission lines and antennas), and modulation as well as
demodulation involved in analog and digital communication systems. Toward that end, this chapter
is divided into three sections. Since the wave concepts that apply to transmission lines are easily
understood, the Ô¨Årst section deals with waves, transmission lines, and antenna fundamentals.
Then we go on to discuss analog and digital communication systems in Sections 15.2 and 15.3,
respectively.
