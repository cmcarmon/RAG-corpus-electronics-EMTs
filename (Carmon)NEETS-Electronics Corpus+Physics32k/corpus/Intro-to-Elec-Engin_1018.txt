Production of Rotating Fields from Single-Phase Windings
In this subsection we show that a single-phase winding carrying alternating current produces a
stationary pulsating ﬂux that can be represented by two counterrotating ﬂuxes of constant and
equal magnitude.
Let us consider a single-phase winding, as shown in Figure 12.3.3(a), carrying alternating
current i = I cos ωt. This winding will produce a ﬂux-density distribution whose axis is ﬁxed
along the axis of the winding and that pulsates sinusoidally in magnitude. The ﬂux density along
the coil axis is proportional to the current and is given by Bm cos ωt, where Bm is the peak ﬂux
density along the coil axis.
