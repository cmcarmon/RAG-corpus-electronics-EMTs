The most successful type of expert system is the rule-based, or production, system. This type of expert system
is chieﬂy composed of IF-THEN (condition-action) rules. For example, the infamous MYCIN expert system,
developed at Stanford University for diagnosing bacterial infections in the blood (meningitis), is rule-based,
consisting of 450–500 rules. XCON, the expert system at Digital Equipment Corporation used for conﬁguring
VAX computer systems, is probably the largest rule-based expert system, consisting of over 11,000 rules. There
are  other  types  of  expert  systems  that  represent  knowledge  in  ways  other  than  rules  or  in  conjunction  with
rules.  Frames,  scripts,  and  semantic  networks  are  popular  knowledge  representation  methods  that  could  be
used in expert systems.
