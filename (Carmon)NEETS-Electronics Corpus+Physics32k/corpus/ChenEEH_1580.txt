Expert systems relying on heuristic rules have a number of
limitations. They fail when a problem does not match the
heuristics or when the heuristics are applied in inappropriate
situations. The model-based approach attempts to address
these problems by solving problems based on theoretical
models of the components and systems. They are less depend-
ent on expert opinion and experience and have higher ï¬‚exibil-
ity and scope for expansion. The downsides are the cost and
complexity of building models and the resulting programs that
may be large and cumbersome (Stern and Luger, 1997).
