An application of risk-sensitive control to satellite attitude
maneuver is given in this section. An application of minimal
cost variance control to an earthquake structure control is also
given here. For linear quadratic Gaussian applications, see
Anderson and Moore (1989), Fleming and Rishel (1975) and
Kwarkernaak and Sivan (1972). For more risk-sensitive control
examples, refer to Bensoussan (1992) and Whittle (1996).
