the individual chest leads V1 through V6 and any 2 of the limb leads, e.g., I and III, are needed to calculate the
full 12-lead ECG. Figure 115.9 is a block diagram of a modern digital-based ECG system. This system uses up
to  13  single-ended  ampliﬁers  and  a  16-bit A/D  converter,  all  within  a  small  lead  wire  manifold  or  ampliﬁer
lead  stage.  The  digital  signals  are  optically  isolated  and  sent  via  a  high-speed  serial  link  to  the  main  ECG
instrument.  Here  the  32-bit  CPU  and  DSP  chip  perform  all  of  the  calculations  and  a  hard  copy  report  is
generated (Fig. 115.7). Notice that each functional block has its own controller and the system requires a real-
time, multitasking operating system to coordinate all system functions. Concomitant with the data acquisition
is the automatic interpretation of the ECG. These programs are quite sophisticated and are continually evolving.
It is still a medical/legal requirement that these ECGs be over-read by the physician.
