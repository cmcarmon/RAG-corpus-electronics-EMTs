This section of the chapter will not present any new material, but will be an example of using all the 
principles presented so far. You should follow each example problem step by step to see how each 
formula used depends upon the information determined in earlier steps. When an example calls for 
solving for square root, you can practice using the square-root table by looking up the values given.
