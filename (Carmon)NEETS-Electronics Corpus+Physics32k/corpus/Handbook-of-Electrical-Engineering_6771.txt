In  the  1920s,  however,  technology  became  available  that  allowed  automatic  switching  of  telephone  calls
through the use of sophisticated electromechanical switching systems. Initially, these switches served as an aid
to operators; ultimately, they led to the replacement of operators. The combination of the rotary telephone dial
and the electromechanical switch allowed customers to directly dial calls without the assistance of operators.
This led to a reduction of human intelligence in the network.
