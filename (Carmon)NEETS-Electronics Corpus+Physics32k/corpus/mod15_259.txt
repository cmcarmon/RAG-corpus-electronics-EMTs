The CONTROL TRANSFORMER (CT) is a synchro device that compares two signals, the 
electrical signal applied to its stator, and the mechanical signal applied to its rotor. The output is an 
electrical voltage, which is taken from the rotor winding and used to control some form of power 
amplifying device. The phase and amplitude of the output voltage depend on the angular position of the 
rotor with respect to the magnetic field of the stator.
