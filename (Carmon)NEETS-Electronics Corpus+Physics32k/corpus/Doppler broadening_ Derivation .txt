When thermal motion causes a particle to move towards the observer, the emitted radiation will be shifted to a higher frequency. Likewise, when the emitter moves away, the frequency will be lowered. For non-relativistic thermal velocities, the Doppler shift in frequency will be:




f
=

f

0



(

1
+


v
c



)



{\displaystyle f=f_{0}\left(1+{\frac {v}{c}}\right)}

where




f


{\displaystyle \ f}
is the observed frequency,





f

0




{\displaystyle \ f_{0}}
is the rest frequency,




v


{\displaystyle \ v}
is the velocity of the emitter towards the observer, and



c


{\displaystyle c}
is the speed of light.
Since there is a distribution of speeds both toward and away from the observer in any volume element of the radiating body, the net effect will be to broaden the observed line. If
