frequency F0. The primary diﬀerence between adult male and female/prepubescent speech is pitch. Before
puberty, pitch frequency for normal speech ranges between 150–400 Hz for both males and females. After
puberty, the vocal cords of males undergo a physical change, which has the eﬀect of lowering their pitch
frequency to the range 80–160 Hz. If we could examine the vocal cord output, we could probably discern
whether the speaker was male or female. This diﬀerence is also readily apparent in the speech signal itself.
To simplify our speech modeling eﬀort, we shall assume that the pitch period is constant. With this
simpliﬁcation, we collapse the vocal-cord-lung system as a simple source that produces the periodic pulse
signal (Figure 4.14). The sound pressure signal thus produced enters the mouth behind the tongue, creates
acoustic disturbances, and exits primarily through the lips and to some extent through the nose. Speech
specialists tend to name the mouth, tongue, teeth, lips, and nasal cavity the vocal tract. The physics
governing the sound disturbances produced in the vocal tract and those of an organ pipe are quite similar.
Whereas the organ pipe has the simple physical structure of a straight tube, the cross-section of the vocal
tract “tube” varies along its length because of the positions of the tongue, teeth, and lips. It is these positions
that are controlled by the brain to produce the vowel sounds. Spreading the lips, bringing the teeth together,
and bringing the tongue toward the front portion of the roof of the mouth produces the sound “ee.” Rounding
the lips, spreading the teeth, and positioning the tongue toward the back of the oral cavity produces the
sound “oh.” These variations result in a linear, time-invariant system that has a frequency response typiﬁed
by several peaks, as shown in Figure 4.15.
