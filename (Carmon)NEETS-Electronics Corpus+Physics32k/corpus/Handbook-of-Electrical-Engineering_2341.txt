There are two versions of the dc equivalent circuit modelâ€”the  injection version and the transport version.
The difference between the two versions lies in the choice of the reference current. In the injection version, the
reference currents are IF and IR, the forward- and reverse-biased diode currents, respectively. In the transport
version, the reference currents are the collector transport current, ICC, and the emitter transport current, ICE.
These currents are of the form:
