Radiation  resistance  is  important  because  it  is 
through  this  resistance  that  electrical  power  is 
transformed  into  radiated  electromagnetic  energy 
(in  the  case  of  a  transmitting  aerial)  and  incident 
electromagnetic  energy 
into 
electrical power (in the case of a receiving aerial).  
 The  equivalent  circuit  of  an  aerial  is  shown  in 
Fig. 13.22. The three series-connected components 
that make up the aerial impedance are: 
 
(a)   the d.c. resistance, Rd.c. 
(b)   the radiation d.c. resistance, Rd.c. 
(c)   the ‘off-tune’ reactance, X
Note  that  when  the  antenna  is  operated  at  a 
frequency  that  lies  in  the  centre  of  its  pass-band 
(i.e.  when  it  is  on-tune) the  off-tune  reactance  is 
zero.  It  is  also  worth  bearing  in  mind  that  the 
radiation  resistance  of  a  half-wave  dipole  varies 
according to its height above ground. The 70 O to
