The solder used to solder wires to electrical connectors, splices, and terminal lugs is a combination 
of 60-percent tin to 40-percent lead (60/40 solder). The melting point of 60/40 solder is 370ยบ F, as shown 
at point B of the figure. Type 60/40 solder is less expensive than 63/37 solder and is suitable for all 
general uses.
