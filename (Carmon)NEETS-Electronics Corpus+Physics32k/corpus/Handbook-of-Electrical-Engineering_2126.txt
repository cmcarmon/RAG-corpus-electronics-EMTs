Introduction
Artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) are among the newest signal-processing technologies in the engineer’s toolbox.
The ﬁeld is highly interdisciplinary, but our approach will restrict the view to the engineering perspective. In
engineering,  neural  networks  serve  two  important  functions:  as  pattern  classiﬁers  and  as  nonlinear  adaptive
ﬁlters. We will provide a brief overview of the theory, learning rules, and applications of the most important
neural network models.
