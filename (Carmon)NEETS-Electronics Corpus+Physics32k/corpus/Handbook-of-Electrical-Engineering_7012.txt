Reliable Information Transmission: Shannonâ€™s Theorem
Shannon  [1948]  considered  the  situation  in  which  the  codeword  duration  grows  without  bound.  Channel
capacity is the maximum rate for which encoders and decoders exist whose probability of error vanishes as the
codewords get longer and longer.
