The references given in this section have been chosen to provide more detail than is possible to provide in the
limited space of this article. In particular, Annaratone [1986] and Shoji [1988] provide much more detail about
device and circuit behavior. Chen [1990], Pimbley et al. [1989], and Wolf [1995] provide many technological
details of processing and its device impact. Haznedar [1991], Sedra and Smith [1991], and Malik [1995] provide
much information about circuits. Brews [1981] and Pierret [1990] provide good discussions of the derivation
of the device current-voltage curves and device behavior in all bias regions.
