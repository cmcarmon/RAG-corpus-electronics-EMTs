A rate gyro is a type of gyroscope, which rather than indicating direction, indicates the rate of change of angle with time. If a gyro has only one gimbal ring, with consequently only one plane of freedom, it can be adapted for use as a rate gyro to measure a rate of angular movement.
Rate gyros are used in rate integrating gyroscopes, and in attitude control systems for vehicles, and in combination with other sensors to make inertial navigation systems.
The advantage of rate gyros over other types of gyros is the fast response rate and their relatively low cost.
