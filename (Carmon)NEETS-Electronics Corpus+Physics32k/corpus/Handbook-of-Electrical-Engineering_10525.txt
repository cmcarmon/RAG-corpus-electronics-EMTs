Intelligent subsystems exchange information within a vehicle, among vehicles in a consist, and between the
vehicle  and  its  external  environment.  This  information  is  exchanged  through  increasingly  sophisticated  net-
works, which may or may not use traditional wiring. There may also be a separate network or layers of error-
checking to handle safety-critical data.
