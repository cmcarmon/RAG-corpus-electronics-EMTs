As an example, consider a human body meshed with 5-mm cubical cells. At 10 cells per free space wavelength,
this would correspond to a maximum frequency of 6 GHZ. But, since the biological materials in the body have
relatively  high  dielectric  constants,  the  wavelength  inside  the  body  is  reduced.  If  the  maximum  dielectric
constant of body materials is 49, then the maximum frequency would be reduced by 7 to about 857 MHz. If
results at higher frequencies are needed, then the cell size must be reduced.
