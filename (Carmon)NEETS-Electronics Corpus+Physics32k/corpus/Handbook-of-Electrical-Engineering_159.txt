T Connection (Fig. 1.28)
The T connection is used for three-phase power trans-
formation when two separate single-phase transformers
with  special  conÔ¨Ågurations  are  available.  If  a  voltage
transformation from V1 to  V2 volts is required, one of
the units (main transformer) must have a voltage ratio
of  V1/V2  with  the  midpoint  of  each  winding  brought
out. The other unit must have a ratio of 0.866V1/0.866V2
with the neutral point brought out, if needed.
