All of the methods described in this subsection assume that the intensity at a given pixel location is reasonably
constant over time. In addition, the gradient methods assume that the size of the displacements is small. Block
matching algorithms have been used extensively in real systems, because the computational complexity is not
too great. The one disadvantage is that there is only one displacement estimate per block. To date, optical ﬂow
algorithms have found limited use because of their sensitivity to noise. Token matching methods work well for
applications in which the features are well deﬁned and easily extracted. They are probably not suitable for most
video communications applications.
