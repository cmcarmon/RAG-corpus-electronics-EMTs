We stress that plain RSA (similar to plain versions of Rabin’s [1979] scheme and DSS) is not secure under
the  above  deﬁnition.  However,  it  may  be  secure  if  the  message  is  “randomized”  before  RSA  (or  the  other
schemes) is applied. Thus, the randomization paradigm seems pivotal here too.
