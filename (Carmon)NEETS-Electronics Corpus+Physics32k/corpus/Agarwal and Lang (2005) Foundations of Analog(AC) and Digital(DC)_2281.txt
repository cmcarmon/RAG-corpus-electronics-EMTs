Lumped circuits comprise lumped elements connected by ideal wires. A lumped
element has the property that a unique terminal voltage V(t) and terminal current
I(t) can be defined for it. As depicted in Figure A.1, for a two-terminal element,
V is the voltage across the terminals of the element, and I is the current through
the element. As we will show shortly, the voltage and the current are defined
for an element or for points within a circuit only under certain constraints that
we collectively call the lumped matter discipline.
