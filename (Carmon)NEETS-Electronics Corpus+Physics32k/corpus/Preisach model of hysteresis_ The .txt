One of the easiest ways to look at the Preisach model is using a geometric interpretation. Consider a plane of coordinates



α
β


{\displaystyle \alpha \beta }
. On this plane, each point



(

α

i


,

β

i


)


{\displaystyle (\alpha _{i},\beta _{i})}
is mapped to a specific relay hysteron




R


α

i


,

β

i






{\displaystyle R_{\alpha _{i},\beta _{i}}}
.
We consider only the half-plane



α
<
β


{\displaystyle \alpha <\beta }
as any other case does not have a physical equivalent in nature.
Next, we take a specific point on the half plane and build a right triangle by drawing two lines parallel to the axes, both from the point to the line



α
=
β


{\displaystyle \alpha =\beta }
.
We now present the Preisach density function, denoted



μ
(
α
,
β
)


{\displaystyle \mu (\alpha ,\beta )}
. This function describes the amount of relay hysterons of each distinct values of



(

α

i


,

β

i


)


{\displaystyle (\alpha _{i},\beta _{i})}
. As a default we say that outside the right triangle



μ
(
α
,
β
)
=
0


{\displaystyle \mu (\alpha ,\beta )=0}
.
A modified formulation of the classical Preisach model has been presented, allowing analytical expression of the Everett function. This makes the model considerably faster and especially adequate for inclusion in electromagnetic field computation or electric circuit analysis codes.
