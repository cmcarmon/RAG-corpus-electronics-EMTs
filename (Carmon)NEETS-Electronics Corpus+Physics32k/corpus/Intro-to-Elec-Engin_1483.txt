When a mobile user (identiﬁed by the telephone number and telephone serial number assigned
by the manufacturer) communicates via radio with the base station within the cell, the base station
routes the call through the MTSO to another base station if the called party is located in another
cell, or to the central ofﬁce if the called party is not mobile. Once the desired telephone number is
keyed and the “send” button is pressed, the MTSO checks the authentication of the mobile user and

of the voice signal from the mobile telephone to the base station. A second frequency is assigned
for radio transmission from the base station to the mobile user. Simultaneous transmission between
two parties is known as full-duplex operation. In order to complete the connection to the called
party, the MTSO interfaces with the central ofﬁce of the telephone network by means of wide-
