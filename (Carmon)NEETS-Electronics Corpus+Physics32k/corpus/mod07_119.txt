Although the N-type material has an excess of free electrons, it is still electrically neutral. This is
because the donor atoms in the N material were left with positive charges after free electrons became
available by covalent bonding (the protons outnumbered the electrons). Therefore, for every free electron
in the N material, there is a corresponding positively charge atom to balance it. The end result is that the
N material has an overall charge of zero.
