FIGURE 9.17 Top: MRI-derived Breast Model. This image shows
the location of a 2-mm diameter malignant breast tumor at a depth of
3 cm. Bottom: image reconstructed from backscattered waveforms
obtained by FDTD modeling. The scale is in decibels. Note that the
tumor signature is 15â€“30 dB (30 to 1,000 times) stronger than the
backscattering clutter due to the surrounding normal tissues. Cour-
tesy of Bond et al. (2003).
