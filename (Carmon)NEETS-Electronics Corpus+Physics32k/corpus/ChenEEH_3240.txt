adequate quantities to accomplish the economic power fac-
tor. Many of these installations have sophisticated controls
designed to perform automatic switching. Of course, a Ô¨Åxed
capacitor is not a voltage regulator and cannot be directly
compared to regulators, but,
in some cases, automatically
switched capacitors can replace conventional step-type voltage
regulators for voltage control on distribution feeders.
