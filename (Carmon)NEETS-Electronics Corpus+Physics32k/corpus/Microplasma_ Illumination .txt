The team of Gary Eden and Sung-Jin Park are pioneering the use of microplasmas for general illumination. Their apparatus uses many microplasma generators in a large array, which emit light through a clear, transparent window. Unlike fluorescent lamps, which require the electrodes to be far apart in a cylindrical cavity and vacuum conditions, microplasma light sources can be put into many different shapes and configurations, and generate heat. This is opposed to the more commonly used fluorescent lamps which require a noble gas atmosphere (usually argon), where eximer formation and resulting radiative decomposition strikes a phosphor coating to create light. Excimer light sources are also being produced and researched. The stable, non-equilibrium condition of microplasmas favors three-body collisions which can lead to excimer formation. The excimer, an unstable molecule produced by collisions of excited atoms, is very short lived due to its rapid dissociation. Upon their decomposition, excimers release different kinds of radiation when electrons fall to lower energy levels. One application, which has been pursued by the Hyundai Display Advanced Technology R&D Research Center and the University of Illinois, is to use excimer light sources in flat panel displays.
