By packing different data elements together, a larger band-
width can be obtained (Vandecappelle et al., 1999). Conse-
quently, the data bus widens and more data are transferred.
These elements can belong to the same signal (packing), or
they can belong to different signals (merging). In addition to
the wider bus, such a coupling of two elements can cause many
redundant transfers when only one of the elements is needed.
Needless to say, this option should be considered very carefully.
