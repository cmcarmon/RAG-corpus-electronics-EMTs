Note that equation 4.8 can be satisﬁed for each local data path
Ri?Rf in a circuit if a sufﬁciently large value—larger than the
greatest value ^DDi; f
PM in a circuit—is chosen for TCP. Further-
more, equation 4.9 can be satisﬁed across an entire circuit if it
Pm  0 for each local data path Ri?Rf in
can be ensured that ^DDi; f
the circuit. The timing constraints of these equations can be
satisﬁed because choosing a sufﬁciently large clock period
TCP is always possible and ^DDi; f
Pm is positive for a properly
designed local data path Ri?Rf . The application of this zero
clock skew methodology of equations 4.7 through 4.9 has been
central to the design of fully synchronous digital circuits for
decades (Friedman, 1995, 1997; Lee and Kong, 1997). By
requiring the clock signal to arrive at each register Rj with
approximately the same delay t j
cd, these design methods have
become known as zero clock skew methods.7
