To control these thermal effects, process sequences are carefully designed to limit high-temperature steps.
This design effort is shortened and improved by the use of computer modeling of the processes. Dopant-ion
movement is complex, however, and its theory is made more difÔ¨Åcult by the growing trend to use rapid thermal
processing that involves short-time heat treatments. As a result, dopant response is not steady state, but transient.
Computer  models  of  transient  response  are  primitive,  forcing  further  advance  in  small-device  design  to  be
more empirical.
