An apparent molar property of a solution component in a mixture or solution is a quantity defined with the purpose of isolating the contribution of each component to the non-ideality of the mixture. It shows the change in the corresponding solution property (for example, volume) when all of that component is added to the solution, per mole of component added. It is described as apparent because it appears to represent the molar property of that component in solution, provided that the properties of the other solution components are assumed to remain constant during the addition. However this assumption is often not justified, since the values of apparent molar properties of a component may be quite different from its molar properties in the pure state.
For instance, the volume of a solution containing two components identified as solvent and solute is given by

where V0 is the volume of the pure solvent before adding the solute and

is the apparent molar volume of the solute, and n1 is the number of moles of the solute in the solution. By dividing this relation to the molar amount of one component a relation between the apparent molar property of a component and the mixing ratio of components can be obtained.
This equation serves as the definition of

may then be considered as the molar volume of the solute if it is assumed that the molar volume of the solvent is unchanged by the addition of solute. However this assumption must often be considered unrealistic as shown in the Examples below, so that

Apparent quantities can also be expressed using mass instead of number of moles. This expression produces apparent specific quantities, like the apparent specific volume.

Apparent (molar) properties are not constants (even at a given temperature), but are functions of the composition. At infinite dilution, an apparent molar property and the corresponding partial molar property become equal.
Some apparent molar properties that are commonly used are apparent molar enthalpy, apparent molar heat capacity, and apparent molar volume.
