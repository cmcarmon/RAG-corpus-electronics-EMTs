Heterodyne frequency meters are available in several varieties. They measure the frequency of the
unknown signal by matching the unknown signal with a locally generated signal of the same frequency
obtained from a calibrated, precision oscillator. This method is normally referred to as  zero beating.
When a perfect frequency match is obtained, it is indicated by the absence of a beat note (zero beat). The
technician generally uses a set of headphones to detect a zero-beat condition in the equipment being
tested.
