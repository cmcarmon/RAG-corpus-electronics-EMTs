Some advanced sound level meters can also include reverberation time (RT60) measurement capabilities. Measurements can be done using the Integrated Impulse Response or Interrupted Noise Methods. Such sound level meters should comply with latest ISO 3382-2 and ASTM E2235-04 measurement standards. Also required for measuring the acoustics in buildings is a signal generator that provides pink or white noise through an amplifier and omnidirectional speakers. Such measurements are also used for calculation of wall/partition sound insulation.
