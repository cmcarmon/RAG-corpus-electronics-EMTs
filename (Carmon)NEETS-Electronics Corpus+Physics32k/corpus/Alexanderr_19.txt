1.4
As explained brieï¬‚y in the previous section, to move the electron in a
conductor in a particular direction requires some work or energy trans-
fer. This work is performed by an external electromotive force (emf),
typically represented by the battery in Fig. 1.3. This emf is also known
as voltage or potential difference. The voltage 
between two points
a and  b in  an  electric  circuit  is  the  energy  (or  work)  needed  to  move
a unit charge from a to b; mathematically,
