The spin current is described by a second-rank tensor qij, where the first index refers to the direction of flow, and the second one – to the spin component that is flowing. Thus qxy denotes the flow density of the y-component of spin in the x-direction. Introduce also the vector qi of charge flow density (which is related to the normal current density j=eq), where e is the elementary charge.The coupling between spin and charge currents is due to spin-orbit interaction. It may be described in a very simple way by introducing a single dimensionless coupling parameter ʏ.
