FIGURE 5.11 Typical Characterization of the (Small-Signal) High-Frequency Performance of Transistors. (A) This ﬁgure shows bias
dependence of transit frequency fT and maximum oscillation frequency fmax. (B) Shown here is a sketch of noise ﬁgure [¼ 10log(F)] versus
frequency. Typical units: f , fT , fmax in GHz; NF in dB.
