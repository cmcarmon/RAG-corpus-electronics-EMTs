Recovering pressure from the velocity field is easy. The discrete weak equation for the pressure gradient is,

{\displaystyle (\mathbf {g} _{i},\nabla p)=-\left(\mathbf {g} _{i},\left(\mathbf {u} \cdot \nabla \right)\mathbf {u} _{j}\right)-\nu \left(\nabla \mathbf {g} _{i}:\nabla \mathbf {u} _{j}\right)+\left(\mathbf {g} _{i},\mathbf {f} ^{I}\right)}

where the test/weight functions are irrotational. Any conforming scalar finite element may be used. However, the pressure gradient field may also be of interest. In this case one can use scalar Hermite elements for the pressure. For the test/weight functions gi one would choose the irrotational vector elements obtained from the gradient of the pressure element.
