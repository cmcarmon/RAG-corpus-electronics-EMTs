In the rest frame of the particle the inner product of the momentum is

μ



p

{\displaystyle p_{\mu }p^{\mu }=-(mc)^{2}\,}
.
Therefore, the rest mass (m) is a Lorentz scalar. The relationship remains true independent of the frame in which the inner product is calculated. In many cases the rest mass is written as




m

0




{\displaystyle m_{0}}
to avoid confusion with the relativistic mass, which is



γ

m

0




{\displaystyle \gamma m_{0}}
