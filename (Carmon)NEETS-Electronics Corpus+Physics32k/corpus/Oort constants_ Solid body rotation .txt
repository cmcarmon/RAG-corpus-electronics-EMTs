To begin, let one assume that the rotation of the Milky Way can be described by solid body rotation, as shown by the green curve in Figure 3. Solid body rotation assumes that the entire system is moving as a rigid body with no differential rotation. This results in a constant angular velocity,



Ω


{\displaystyle \Omega }
, which is independent of



R


{\displaystyle R}
. Following this we can see that velocity scales linearly with



R


{\displaystyle R}
,



v
∝
r


{\displaystyle v\propto r}
, thus












d
v


d

=


v

=
Ω






{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&{\frac {dv}{dr}}={\frac {v}{r}}=\Omega \\\end{aligned}}}

Using the two Oort constant identities, one then can determine what the



A


{\displaystyle A}
and



B


{\displaystyle B}
constants would be,

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}&A={\frac {1}{2}}\left({\frac {\Omega _{0}R_{0}}{R_{0}}}-{\Omega }{\Bigg \vert }_{R_{0}}\right)=0\\&B=-{\frac {1}{2}}\left({\frac {\Omega _{0}R_{0}}{R_{0}}}+{\Omega }{\Bigg \vert }_{R_{0}}\right)=-\Omega _{0}\\\end{aligned}}}

This demonstrates that in solid body rotation, there is no shear motion, i.e.



A
=
0


{\displaystyle A=0}
, and the vorticity is just the angular rotation,



B
=
−
Ω


{\displaystyle B=-\Omega }
. This is what one would expect because there is no difference in orbital velocity as radius increases, thus no stress between the annuli. Also, in solid body rotation, the only rotation is about the center, so it is reasonable that the resulting vorticity in the system is described by the only rotation in the system. One can actually measure and find that is non-zero (



A
=
14


{\displaystyle A=14}
km s−1 kpc−1.). Thus the galaxy does not rotate as a solid body in our local neighborhood, but may in the inner regions of the Galaxy.
