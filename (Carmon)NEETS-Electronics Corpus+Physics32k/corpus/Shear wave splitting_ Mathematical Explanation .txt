Mathematical Explanation(Ray theory)
The equation of motion in rectangular Cartesian coordinates can be written as

where t is the time,



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
is the density,




U

j




{\displaystyle U_{j}}
is the component of the displacement vector U, and




c

i
j
k
l




{\displaystyle c_{ijkl}}
represents the elastic tensor.
A wavefront can be described by the equation

The solution to (1) can be expressed as a ray series

where the function




f

n



(
ϑ
)



{\displaystyle f_{n}\left(\vartheta \right)}
satisfies the relation

Substitute (3) into (1),

where the vector operators N,M,L are given by the formula:

where

For the first order



n
=
0


{\displaystyle n=0}
, so




U


(

)



=

U


(

−

)



=
0


{\displaystyle U^{\left(-1\right)}=U^{\left(-2\right)}=0}
, and only the first component of the equation (5) is left.
Thus,

To obtain the solution of (8), the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix




Γ

j
k




{\displaystyle \Gamma _{jk}}
are needed,

which can be rewritten as

where the values



P
,
Q


{\displaystyle P,Q}
and



R


{\displaystyle R}
are the invariants of the symmetric matrix




Γ

j
k




{\displaystyle \Gamma _{jk}}
.
The matrix




Γ

k




{\displaystyle \Gamma _{jk}}
has three eigenvectors:




g

,


g

2


,


g

3




{\displaystyle g_{1},~g_{2},~g_{3}}
, which correspond to three eigenvalues of




G

1


,


G

2


,


{\displaystyle G_{1},~G_{2},}
and





G

{\displaystyle ~G_{3}}
.
For isotropic media,

p

{\displaystyle G_{1}=\alpha ^{2}p_{i}p_{i}}
corresponds to the compressional wave and

p

i




{\displaystyle G_{2}=G_{3}=\beta ^{2}p_{i}p_{i}}
corresponds to the two shear waves traveling together.
For anisotropic media,

G

3




{\displaystyle G_{2}\neq G_{3}}
, indicates that the two shear waves have split.
