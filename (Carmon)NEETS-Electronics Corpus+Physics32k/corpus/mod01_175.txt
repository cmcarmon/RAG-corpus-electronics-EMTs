Occasionally, rather large values of voltage may be encountered, in which case the volt becomes too
small a unit for convenience. In a situation of this nature, the kilovolt (kV), meaning 1,000 volts, is
frequently used. As an example, 20,000 volts would be written as 20 kV. In other cases, the volt may be
too large a unit, as when dealing with very small voltages. For this purpose the millivolt (mV), meaning
one-thousandth of a volt, and the microvolt (µV), meaning one-millionth of a volt, are used. For example,
0.001 volt would be written as 1 mV, and 0.000025 volt would be written as 25 µV. See Appendix II for
exponential symbology.
