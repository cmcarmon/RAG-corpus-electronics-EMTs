A  fascinating  and  very  readable  introduction  to  different  sources  of  information,  their  entropy  rates,  and
different compression algorithms can be found in the book by Lucky [1989]. Implementations of popular data
compression  algorithms  including  adaptive  Huffman  coding,  arithmetic  coding,  Lempelâ€“Ziv  and  the  JPEG
algorithm can be found in Nelson and Gailly [1995].
