is of interest, and our analysis will end here. If the total value of the output (iD)
is desired, then it can be obtained by summing iD and the DC component ID.
Thus, based on the preceding discussion, a systematic procedure for find-
ing incremental voltages and currents for a circuit with a nonlinear device
characterized by the v i relation iD = f (vD) is as follows:
