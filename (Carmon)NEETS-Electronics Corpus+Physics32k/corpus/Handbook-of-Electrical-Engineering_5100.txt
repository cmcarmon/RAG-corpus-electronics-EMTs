FIGURE 57.3
Isolation performance of four isolators centered around 1550 nm shows the effects of different conﬁgurations.
A single-stage isolator (curve A) reaches about –40 dB isolation, and two cascaded single-wavelength isolators (curve B) hit
–80  dB. Wavelength  broadening  (curves  C  and  D)  can  be  tailored  by  cascading  isolators  tuned  to  different  wavelengths.
