Volterra feedback synthesis is shown to provide a capability for
specifying nonlinear input output behavior for a closed-loop
feedback system. The procedure is developed for the class of
linear analytic plants that admit Volterra series representation,
and a simpliﬁed means of systematically realizing the Volterra
kernels and computing the output of the resulting controller is
provided, up to an arbitrary order. The simpliﬁed form is
