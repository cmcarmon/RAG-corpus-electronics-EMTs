(cid:1) We also introduced the MOSFET device, which is a three-terminal circuit
element. Although, as we will see in Chapter 7, the MOSFET has a very
rich behavior, it can be grossly characterized as a switch. We developed the
S and the SR models for the MOSFET, which capture its basic switch-like
behavior.
