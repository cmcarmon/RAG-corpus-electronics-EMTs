Users authorized to change the way the system behaves are often called operators. Users who rely on a system, but do not operate it, are sometimes called the audience or end user.
Different types of system structure use different triggers. Some triggers require user to do certain action (e.g. type phone number for the system to call that person), others get triggered by certain activities related to the user (e.g. person calling user`s phone), however in both types of the system the output could be similar (e.g. phone rings).
In most of the systems there are two different types of users, Single-User (e.g. car driver) type of system is only targeted at one user and others cannot interact with the system at the same time with the main user, Multi-User (e.g. university portal) is the type of system where more than one user can interact with interface simultaneously.
