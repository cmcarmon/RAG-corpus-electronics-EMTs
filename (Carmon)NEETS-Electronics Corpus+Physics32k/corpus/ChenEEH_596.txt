IGBT by the junctions between the pþ substrate, n-type drift,
p-base, and nþ emitter regions. Under normal operation, a
fraction of the holes injected into the drift region by the pþ
substrate are collected by the p-base. These holes travel laterally
in the p-base before being collected at the emitter contact. The
lateral voltage drop may be sufﬁcient to turn on the p-base nþ
emitter junction, eventually latching the parasitic thyristor.
Several improvements have been made in the structure of
present-day IGBTs to incorporate very high latch-up immu-
nity.
