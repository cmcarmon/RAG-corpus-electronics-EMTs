Shift Registers
There are essentially two modes of operation for a register, either serial or parallel, and those we have considered
so far have operated in parallel mode. Parallel operation affects the entire group of bits held in the register
during a single clock pulse. In serial operation data bits are inputted (or outputted) sequentially to (or from)
the register, one bit for every clock pulse.
