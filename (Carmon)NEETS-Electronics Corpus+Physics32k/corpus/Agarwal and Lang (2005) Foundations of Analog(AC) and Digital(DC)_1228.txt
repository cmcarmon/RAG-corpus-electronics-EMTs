Reality now presents us with a dilemma. On the one hand, we wish to work
within the framework of the lumped circuit abstraction so that the circuits we
study all fit within this easily-managed framework. On the other hand, we
should not be forced to ignore circuit effects, in this case parasitic resistance,
capacitance, and inductance, that significantly affect circuit performance. The
resolution of this dilemma is the modeling compromise mentioned in Chapter 1.
Figure 1.27 in Chapter 1 used an ideal wire in series with a lumped resistance to
model a physical wire with some parasitic resistance. Similarly, we will introduce
lumped capacitors and lumped inductors to model the effect of the charge and
the flux. As illustrated in Figure 9.5, a capacitor comprising a pair of parallel
plates collects the positive and negative charge on its plates and effectively
models the distributed charge. Notice that because the capacitor contains equal
positive and negative charges the net charge within the capacitor element is
zero, thereby satisfying the lumped matter discipline. Thus, the capacitor can
be viewed as a lumped element. In like manner, we will introduce a lumped
inductor to model the effect of the flux linked with the wires as illustrated in
Figure 9.6. The lumped matter discipline is satisfied because the flux is entirely
contained inside the lumped inductor, and there is no net flux outside the
element.
