Importance of KVL and KCL
Kirchhoff â€™s current law is used extensively in nodal analysis because it is amenable to computer-based imple-
mentation  and  supports  a  systematic  approach  to  circuit  analysis.  Nodal  analysis  leads  to  a  set  of  algebraic
equations  in  which  the  variables  are  the  voltages  at  the  nodes  of  the  circuit.  This  formulation  is  popular  in
CAD programs because the variables correspond directly to physical quantities that can be measured easily.
