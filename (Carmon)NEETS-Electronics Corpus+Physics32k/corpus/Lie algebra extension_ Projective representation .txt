If G is a matrix Lie group, then elements G of the Lie algebra can be given by




G
=

t

t
=

,


{\displaystyle G={\frac {d}{dt}}\left.(g(t))\right|_{t=0},}

where α is a differentiable path in G that goes through the identity element at t = 0. Commutators of elements of the Lie algebra can be computed using two paths, g1, g2 and the group commutator,

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}[][U_{1},U_{2}]&={\frac {d}{dt}}\left.U(g_{1}(t))U(g_{2}(t))U(g_{1}(t))^{-1}U(g_{2}(t))^{-1}\right|_{t=0}\\&={\frac {d}{dt}}\left.U(g_{1}(t)g_{2}(t)g_{1}(t)^{-1}g_{2}(t)^{-1})\right|_{t=0},\quad G_{1}=g_{1}'(0),G_{2}=g_{2}'(0).\end{aligned}}}

Then there is a Lie algebra between g and u(g) isomorphism sending bases to bases, so that u is a faithful representation of g.
If however U(G) is a projective representation, i.e. a representation up to a phase factor,then the Lie algebra, as computed from the group representation, is not isomorphic to g. In a projective representation the multiplication rule reads

{\displaystyle U(g_{1})U(g_{2})=\omega (g_{1},g_{2})U(g_{1}g_{2})=e^{i\xi (g_{1},g_{2})}U(g_{1}g_{2}).}

The function ω,often required to be smooth, satisfies

because both Ω and U evaluate to the identity at t = 0. For an explanation of the phase factors ξ, see Wigner's theorem. The commutation relations in g for a basis,

G

{\displaystyle [G_{i},G_{j}]={C_{ij}^{k}}G_{k}}

,


{\displaystyle [U_{i},U_{j}]={C_{ij}^{k}}U_{k}+D_{ij}I,}

so in order for u to be closed under the bracket (and hence have a chance of actually being a Lie algebra) a central charge I must be included.
