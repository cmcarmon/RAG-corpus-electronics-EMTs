In this approach, the antenna often takes on additional
functionality. For instance, the circular-segment antenna of
Figure 11.17 has been used to perform harmonic tuning and
ﬁltering in addition to its role as radiator. This is possible
because the higher resonances of the antenna do not corres-
pond to harmonic frequencies of the ampliﬁer because of its
circular nature (Radisic et al., 1997, 1998). Various other tasks
have been assigned to the planar antenna, including using a
two-port antenna for power combining (Deal et al., 1998,
1999) and noise matching. Reviews of AIA technology can be
found in Lin and Itoh (1994, 1998).
