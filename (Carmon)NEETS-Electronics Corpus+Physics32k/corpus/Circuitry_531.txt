Clocks 
 
The  clock  used  in  a  microprocessor  system  is 
simply  an  accurate  and  stable  square  wave 
generator. In most cases the frequency of the square 
wave generator is determined by a quarts crystal. A 
simple  4  MHz  square  wave  clock  oscillator 
(together with the clock waveform that is produces) 
is shown in Fig. 11.4. Note that one complete clock 
cycle is sometimes referred to as a T-state. 
  Microprocessors  sometimes  have  an  internal 
clock  circuit  in  which  case  the  quartz  crystal  (or 
other resonant device) is connected directly to pins 
on  the  microprocessor  chip.  In  Fig.  11.5(a)  an 
external 
a 
microprocessor  whilst  in  Fig.11.5(b)  and  internal 
clock oscillator is used.
