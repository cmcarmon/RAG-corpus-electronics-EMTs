Some projectiles stay connected by a cable to the launch equipment after launching it:
for guidance: wire-guided missile (range up to 4,000 meters)
to administer an electric shock, as in the case of a Taser (range up to 10.6 meters); two projectiles are shot simultaneously, each with a cable.
to make a connection with the target, either to tow it towards the launcher, as with a whaling harpoon, or to draw the launcher to the target, as a grappling hook does.
