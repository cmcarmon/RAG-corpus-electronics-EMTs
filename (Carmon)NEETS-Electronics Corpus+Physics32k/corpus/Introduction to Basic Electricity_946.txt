Take time to be safe when working on electrical and 
electronic circuits. Do not work on any circuits or 
equipment unless the power is secured.
  1.  Work only in clean, dry areas. Avoid working in 
damp or wet locations because the resistance of 
the skin will be lower, increasing the chance of 
electrical shock.
