Example 8.5 
 
Which  of  the  operational  amplifiers  in  the  table 
would  be  most  suitable  for  each  of  the  following 
applications: 
 
(a)  amplifying 
piezoelectric vibration sensor 
 
(b)  a  high-gain  amplifier  that  can  be  used  to 
faithfully amplify very small signals  
 
(c)  a low-frequency amplifier for audio signals.  
 
Solution 
 
(a)  AD548  (this  operational  amplifier  is  designed 
for use in instrumentation applications and it offers 
a very low input offset current  which is important 
when  the  input  is  derived  from  a  piezoelectric 
transducer) 
 
(b)  CA3140  (this 
low-noise  operational 
amplifier  that  also  offers  high  gain  and  fast  slew 
rate) 
 
(c)  LM348  or  LM741  (both  are  general  purpose 
operational amplifiers and are ideal for non-critical 
applications such as audio amplifiers).
