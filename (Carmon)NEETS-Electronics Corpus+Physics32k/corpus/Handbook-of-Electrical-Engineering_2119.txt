Deciding if a detected target does or does not belong to a speciÔ¨Åc class.
Measuring at least one of the instantaneous positions and velocity components of a target 
(either relative or absolute), such as range, bearing, range rate, or bearing rate.
Determining, controlling, and/or steering a course through a medium (includes avoidance of 
obstacles and the boundaries of the medium).
Instead of a wire link, transmitting and receiving acoustic power and information.
Using a sound-activated release mechanism.
Transmitting a sound signal continuously (beacons) or transmitting only when suitably 
interrogated (transponders).
Sending short pulses downward and timing the bottom return.
Using pairs of transducers pointing obliquely downwards to obtain speed over the bottom from 
the Doppler shift of the bottom return.
