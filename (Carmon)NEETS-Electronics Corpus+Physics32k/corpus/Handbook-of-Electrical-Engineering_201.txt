Ramp: A continually growing signal such that its value is zero for t £ 0 and proportional to time t for t > 0.
Sinusoid: 
Unit impulse: A very short pulse such that its value is zero for t „ 0 and the integral of the pulse is 1.
Unit step: Function of time that is zero for t < t0 and unity for t > t0. At  t = t0 the magnitude changes from
