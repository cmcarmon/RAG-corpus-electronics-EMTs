As you might imagine, this can be a labor-intensive process, especially if more than one
resistor must be built! Another, easier solution to the dilemma of a custom resistance is to
connect multiple ﬁxed-value resistors together in series-parallel fashion to obtain the desired
value of resistance. This solution, although potentially time-intensive in choosing the best
resistor values for making the ﬁrst resistance, can be duplicated much faster for creating mul-
tiple custom resistances of the same value:
