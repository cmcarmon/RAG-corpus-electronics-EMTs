Overview of Semiconductor Device Simulators
Device simulators are based on the physics of semiconductor devices. The input to the simulator takes the form
of information about the device under consideration such as material type, device, dimensions, doping con-
centrations, and operating conditions. Based on this information, the device simulator computes the electric
ﬁeld inside the device and thus predicts carrier concentrations in the different regions of the device. Device
simulators can also predict transient behavior, including quantities such as current–voltage characteristics and
frequency bandwidth. The three basic approaches to device simulation are (1) the classical approach, (2) the
semiclassical approach, and (3) the quantum mechanical approach.
