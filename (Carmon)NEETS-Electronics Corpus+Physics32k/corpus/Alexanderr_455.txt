8.11.1 Automobile Ignition System
In  Section  7.9.4,  we  considered  the  automobile  ignition  system  as  a
charging  system.  That  was  only  a  part  of  the  system.  Here,  we  con-
sider another partâ€”the voltage generating system. The system is mod-
eled  by  the  circuit  shown  in  Fig.  8.52. The  12-V source  is  due  to  the
resistor represents the resistance of the
battery and alternator. The 
wiring. The  ignition  coil  is  modeled  by  the  8-mH  inductor. The 
1-mF
capacitor (known as the condenser to automechanics) is in parallel with
the switch (known as the breaking points or electronic ignition). In the
following  example,  we  determine  how  the  RLC circuit  in  Fig.  8.52  is
used in generating high voltage.
