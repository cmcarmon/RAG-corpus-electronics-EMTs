Combining series and parallel resistors
Many circuits combine series resistors and parallel resistors in various 
ways to restrict current in some parts of the circuit while splitting current 
in other parts of the circuit. In some cases, you can calculate equivalent 
resistance by combining the equations for resistors in series and resistors 
in parallel.
