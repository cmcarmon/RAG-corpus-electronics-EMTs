Set up your work area — and yourself — with soldering safety in mind. 
Make sure the room is well ventilated, you have the iron placed snugly in 
its stand, and you position the electrical cord to avoid snags. Wear shoes 
(no flip‐flops!), safety glasses, and an antistatic wristband when solder-
ing. Avoid bringing your face too close to hot solder, which can irritate 
your respiratory system and possibly sputter. Keep your face to one side, 
and use a  magnifying glass, if needed, to see tiny components that you’re 
 soldering.
