The ﬁrst step in the development of a simulation program is to deﬁne the topology of the system, which
speciﬁes the manner in which the individual subsystems are connected. The subsystem models must then be
deﬁned  by  specifying  the  signal  processing  operation  to  be  performed  by  each  of  the  various  subsystems. A
simulation structure may be either ﬁxed topology or free topology. In a ﬁxed topology simulation, the basic
structure shown in Fig. 78.1 is modeled. Various subsystems can be bypassed if desired by setting switches, but
the basic topology cannot be modiﬁed. In a free topology structure, subsystems can be interconnected in any
way desired and new additional subsystems can be added at will.
