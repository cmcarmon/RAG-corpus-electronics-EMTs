Examine table 2-1 again, and take particular note of the power ratios for source levels of 3 dB and 6 
dB. As the table illustrates, an increase of 3 dB represents a doubling of power. The reverse is also true. If 
a signal decreases by 3 dB, half the power is lost. For example, a 1,000 watt signal decreased by 3 dB will 
equal 500 watts while a 1,000 watt signal increased by 3 dB equals 2,000 watts.
