{\displaystyle {\mbox{If }}{\frac {\mathrm {d} B}{\mathrm {d} t}}{\begin{cases}>0,&{\frac {\mathrm {d} B}{\mathrm {d} t}}={\mbox{ maximum power generated}}\\<0,&{\frac {\mathrm {d} B}{\mathrm {d} t}}={\mbox{ minimum power required}}\end{cases}}\qquad {\mbox{(14)}}}

This expression applies equally well for theoretical ideals in a wide variety of applications: electrolysis (decrease in G), galvanic cells and fuel cells (increase in G), explosives (increase in A), heating and refrigeration (exchange of H), motors (decrease in U) and generators (increase in U).
Utilization of the exergy concept often requires careful consideration of the choice of reference environment because, as Carnot knew, unlimited reservoirs do not exist in the real world. A system may be maintained at a constant temperature to simulate an unlimited reservoir in the lab or in a factory, but those systems cannot then be isolated from a larger surrounding environment. However, with a proper choice of system boundaries, a reasonable constant reservoir can be imagined. A process sometimes must be compared to "the most realistic impossibility," and this invariably involves a certain amount of guesswork.
