155 BONUS is a 155 mm NATO artillery round that consists of a 47-kilogram (104 lb) heavy artillery projectile containing two autonomous, sensor-fused, fire-and-forget submunitions.
After the submunition is released it opens two winglets. While descending, the submunition rotates, scanning the area below with multi-frequency infra-red sensors that compares the detected vehicles with a programmable target database. The submunitions each contain a high-penetration EFP warhead for use against even heavy armoured armoured fighting vehicles like main battle tanks.
