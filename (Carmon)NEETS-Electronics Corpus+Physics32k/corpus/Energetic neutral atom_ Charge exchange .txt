In a charge-exchange collision between a high energy plasma ion and a cold neutral atom, the ion 'steals' electrons from the neutral atom, producing a cold ion and an energetic neutral atom(ENA).
I1+ + A2 → A1 + I2+
where
I1+ plasma ion
A2 background neutral atom (lower energy)
A1 energetic neutral atom (ENA)
I2+ lower energy ion
Species 1 and 2 may be the same or different and an exchange of two electrons is possible, e.g.

H+ + H → H + H+
Proton–hydrogen charge-exchange
orHe2+ + He → He + He2+
alpha-helium charge-exchange.
Due to its charge neutrality, the resulting ENA is subject to gravitational forces only. Because gravitation influences can normally be ignored, it is safe to assume that the ENA preserves the vector momentum of the original pre-interaction plasma ion.
Some ENAs are lost in further charge-exchange, electron collisions and photoionization, but a great many travel very long distances in space completely undisturbed.
Although plasma recombination and neutral atom acceleration by the solar gravitation may also contribute to an ENA population under certain conditions, the main exception to this creation scenario is the flux of interstellar gas, where neutral particles from the local interstellar medium penetrate the heliosphere with considerable velocity, which classifies them as ENAs as well.
