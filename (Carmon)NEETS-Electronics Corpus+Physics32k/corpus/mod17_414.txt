Common methods of time-division multiplexing include PULSE AMPLITUDE MODULATION 
(pam), PULSE WIDTH or PULSE DURATION MODULATION (pwm or pdm), PULSE POSITION 
MODULATION (ppm), and PULSE CODE MODULATION (pcm). We have been studying an example 
of pulse amplitude modulation. (These methods of tdm were discussed in NEETS, Module 12, 
Modulation Principles.)
