One  of  the  most  important  parameters  of  an 
amplifier is the amount of amplification or gain that 
it  provides.  Gain  is  simply  the  ratio  of  output 
voltage  to  input  voltage,  output  current  to  input 
current,  or  output  power  to  input  power  (see  
Fig. 7.2). These three ratios give, respectively, the 
voltage gain, current gain and power gain. Thus:
