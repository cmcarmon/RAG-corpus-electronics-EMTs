• As the received signal becomes increasingly noisy, whether due to increased distance from the transmit-
ter (smaller α) or to increased noise in the channel (larger N0), the probability the receiver makes an
error approaches 1/2. In such situations, the receiver performs only slightly better than the “receiver”
that ignores what was transmitted and merely guesses what bit was transmitted. Consequently, it
becomes almost impossible to communicate information when digital channels become noisy.
• As the signal-to-noise ratio increases, performance gains–smaller probability of error pe – can be easily
obtained. At a signal-to-noise ratio of 12 dB, the probability the receiver makes an error equals 10−8.
In words, one out of one hundred million bits will, on the average, be in error.
• Once the signal-to-noise ratio exceeds about 5 dB, the error probability decreases dramatically. Adding
• Signal set choice can make a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in performance. All BPSK signal sets, baseband or
modulated, yield the same performance for the same bit energy. The BPSK signal set does perform
much better than the FSK signal set once the signal-to-noise ratio exceeds about 5 dB.
Exercise 6.20
(Solution on p. 256.)
Derive the expression for the probability of error that would result if the FSK signal set were used.
