Because zero resistance causes full-scale deflection, you should realize that the deflection of the
meter is inversely proportional to the resistance being tested; that is, for a small resistance value, the
deflection will be nearly full scale; and for a large resistance value, the deflection will be considerably
less. This means that the left portion of the OHMS scale represents high resistance; the right side of the
scale represents low resistance. Zero resistance (a short circuit) is indicated on the extreme right side of
the scale; infinite resistance (an open circuit) is located on the extreme left side of the scale.
