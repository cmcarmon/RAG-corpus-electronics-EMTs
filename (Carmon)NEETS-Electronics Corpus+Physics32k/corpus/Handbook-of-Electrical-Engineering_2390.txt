′ =  2(2πmn*k)3/2/h3,
where  φ
where h is Planck’s constant, ED is the donor energy, and ED0 and α
DT. The above
equation  describes  the  simplest  type  of  charge  balance,  in  which  the  donor  (called  a  single  donor)  has  only
one charge-state transition within a few kT of the Fermi energy. An example of such a donor is Si on a Ga site
in GaN, for which g0 = 1, and g1 = 2. If there are multiple single donors, then equivalent terms are added on
the  right-hand  side  of  Eq. (22.105);  if  there  are  double  or  triple  donors,  or  more  than  one  acceptor,  proper
variations of Eq. (22.105) can be found in the literature [Look, 1989].
