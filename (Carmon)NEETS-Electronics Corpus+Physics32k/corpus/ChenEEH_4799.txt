Note that the weights in the action and the critic networks
were trained using their internal cycles, Na and Nc , respec-
tively. That is, within each time-step, the weights of the two
networks were updated for at most Na and Nc times, respec-
tively, or stopped once the internal training error threshold Ta
and Tc has been met.
