UHF stations that want to achieve their maximum licensed power output are faced with installing a very
high-power transmitter. Typical pairings include a transmitter rated for 220 kW and an antenna with a gain of
25, or a 110-kW transmitter and a gain-of-50 antenna. In the latter case, the antenna could pose a signiﬁcant
problem. UHF antennas with gains in the region of 50 are possible, but not advisable for most installations
because of the coverage problems that can result. High-gain antennas have a narrow vertical radiation pattern
that can reduce a station’s coverage in areas near the transmitter site.
