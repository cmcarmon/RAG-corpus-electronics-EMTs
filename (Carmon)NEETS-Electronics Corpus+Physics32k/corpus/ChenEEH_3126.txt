There are two standard tests that are performed on synchro-
nous machines to determine their steady state parameters and
verify the design. These are the open circuit saturation test
and the steady-state short circuit test (also known as the
synchronous impedance test). In the open circuit test, the
machine is run at rated speed with the stator winding open
circuited. The ﬁeld current is varied, and the terminal voltage
is plotted as a function of the ﬁeld current. A typical test is
shown in Figure 4.26.
