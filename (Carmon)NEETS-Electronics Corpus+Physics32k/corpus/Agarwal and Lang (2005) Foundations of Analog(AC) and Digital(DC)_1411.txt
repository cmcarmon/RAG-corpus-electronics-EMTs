As an inductor-resistor example, consider the current response of the series
RL circuit from Figure 10.9a redrawn in Figure 10.13. As sketched in Figure
10.13, the initial current through the inductor is zero. The final current through
the inductor is V/R, because the inductor behaves like a long-term short circuit.
The time constant of the circuit is L/R. Substituting into Equation 10.61, we get
