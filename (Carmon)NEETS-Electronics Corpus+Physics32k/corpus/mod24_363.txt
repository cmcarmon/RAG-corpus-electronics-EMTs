Coupling losses due to fiber alignment depend on fiber type, core diameter, and the distribution of
optical power among propagating modes. Fibers with large NAs reduce loss from angular misalignment
and increase loss from fiber separation. Single mode fibers are more sensitive to alignment errors than
multimode fibers because of their small core size. However, alignment errors in multimode fiber
