Unlike western notation, numbering Japanese game records is not obligatory. Although players' moves often aren't numbered, shogi moves are always counted per player's move. This is commonly seen in checkmate problems where a 3-move ３手 checkmate problem would mean a move sequence of black-white-black. This is unlike western chess which counts each pair of moves as one move. (In western notation for shogi, the move numbering tends to follow western chess notation conventions.)
