When a transverse shear force is applied to a structure, such as a beam, the result is variation in bending normal stresses along the length of the beam. This variation necessitates an internal horizontal shear stress within the beam that varies with position y' from the neutral axis in the beam. The concept of complementary shear then dictates that a shear stress also exists along the front face of the beam. As described above, in thin-walled structures the variation with thickness can be neglected, and the shear stress along the front face of the structure can be examined as shear flow, or the shear stress multiplied by the thickness of the element.
