Multicasting is relatively easier to achieve for one-way com-
munication than for two-way communication. For example, in
the case of Internet radio, multicasting can be achieved by
creating a spanning tree consisting of the sender at the root
and the receiver at the leaves as well as replicating packets over
all links that reach the receivers. In the case of two-way com-
munication like Internet telephony among multiple parties,
however, some form of audio mixing functionality is required
that mixes the audios from all participants and only relays the
correct information. Without this audio mixer, a two-way
communication channel needs to be established between
each participant in an all-to-all mesh fashion, which may
amount to waste of bandwidth.
