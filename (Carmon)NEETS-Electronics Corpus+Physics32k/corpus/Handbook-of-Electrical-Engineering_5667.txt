With some of the likely double-contingency outages, the transmission system should supply all system load
without exceeding emergency ratings. One criterion is not to exceed 2- to 10-day emergency ratings when any
line and any transformer are out of service or when any line and any generator are out of service. This gives
time to repair the line. With the outage of any transformer and any generator, 30-day emergency ratings should
not be exceeded, which gives time to install a spare transformer.
