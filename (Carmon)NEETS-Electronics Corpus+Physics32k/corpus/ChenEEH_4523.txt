mental data accurately in all but the low-frequency range of
channels corresponding to the AMD command input and the
acceleration outputs. A detailed analytical modeling of the
system reveals that there are four (respectively two) Ô¨Åxed dc
zeros from AMD command input to the structure (respectively
AMD) acceleration outputs:
