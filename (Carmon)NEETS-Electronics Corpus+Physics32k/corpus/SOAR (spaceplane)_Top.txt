SOAR was a partially reusable air-launched spaceplane launch system concept designed to launch small satellites on a suborbital or orbital trajectory. The vehicle, derived from the Hermes spacecraft developed by the European Space Agency, was planned to be built, launched, and operated by Swiss Space Systems. The spaceplane was planned to launch from an Airbus A300 aircraft named S3 Zero Gravity Airliner. Once at altitude, the spaceplane was planned to separate from the aircraft and ignite an NK-39 engine developed by Russian Federal Space Agency. After fuel depletion at about 80 kilometers altitude, the plane was planned to release its payload before gliding back and landing on Earth.
The launch vehicle was planned to also have low Earth orbit capability when launched in conjunction with an expendable upper stage. Swiss Space Systems has contracted the Russian firm RKK Energia to develop the upper stage. With an upper stage, the spacecraft was planned to be able to launch a 250 kilogram payload into orbit.
Swiss Space Systems claimed that the spaceplane could cost about four times less than current suborbital launch costs. The spaceplane was notionally targeted to have its first test launch by 2017. However, following financial trouble, the company was declared bankrupt in a Swiss civil court, ending operations of the company.
