TORQUE DIFFERENTIAL RECEIVER (TDR)A type of differential synchro that takes two electrical 
inputs, one to the rotor and one to the stator, and produces a mechanical output. The output is the 
angular position of the rotor that represents the algebraic sum or difference of the two electrical inputs 
[15].
