The volume of gas increases proportionally to absolute temperature and decreases inversely proportionally to pressure, approximately according to the ideal gas law:




V
=



n
R
T

p




{\displaystyle V={\frac {nRT}{p}}}

where:

p is the pressure
V is the volume
n is the amount of substance of gas (moles)
R is the gas constant, 8.314 J·K−1mol−1
T is the absolute temperature

To simplify, a volume of gas may be expressed as the volume it would have in standard conditions for temperature and pressure, which are 0 °C and 100 kPa.
