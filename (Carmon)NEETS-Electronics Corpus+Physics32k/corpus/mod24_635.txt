Semiconductor LEDs emit incoherent light. Spontaneous emission of light in semiconductor LEDs
produces light waves that lack a fixed-phase relationship. Light waves that lack a fixed-phase relationship
are referred to as incoherent light. Spontaneous emission of light is discussed in more detail later in this
chapter. The use of LEDs in single mode systems is severely limited because they emit unfocused
incoherent light. Even LEDs developed for single mode systems are unable to launch sufficient optical
power into single mode fibers for many applications. LEDs are the preferred optical source for multimode
systems because they can launch sufficient power at a lower cost than semiconductor LDs.
