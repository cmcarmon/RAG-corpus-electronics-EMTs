where Tpo is the Debye temperature and ε∞ is the high-frequency dielectric constant. This formula for τ
po(E)
has the following property: if only p-o scattering existed, then an accurate BTE calculation of µ
H vs. T [Rode,
1975] would give results almost identical to those obtained by the RTA analysis described above, i.e., by setting
H = e 〈τ2〉/m∗〈τ〉. However, when other scattering mechanisms are also important, then the RTA solution may
µ
not be as reliable. Fortunately, at low temperatures (e.g., below about 150K in GaN), p-o scattering weakens,
and the RTA approach is quite accurate. This fact is important because we usually are interested in obtaining
a  good  value  of  the  acceptor  concentration  NA  from  the µ
H  vs.  T  ﬁt,  and  NA  appears  directly  only  in  the  ii-
scattering formula Eq. (22.100), which is usually dominant at low temperatures.
