An optical detector can be either a semiconductor positive-intrinsic-negative (PIN) diode or an
avalanche photodiode (APD). A PIN diode changes its electrical conductivity according to the intensity
and wavelength of light. The PIN diode consists of an intrinsic region between p-type and n-type
semiconductor material. Chapter 6 provides further explanation of optical sources. Chapter 7 provides
further explanation of optical detectors.
