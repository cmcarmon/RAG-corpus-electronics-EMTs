A sine wave is used to represent values of electrical current or voltage. The greater its height, the 
greater the value it represents. As you have studied, a sine wave alternately rises above and then falls 
below the reference line. That part above the line represents a positive value and is referred to as a 
POSITIVE ALTERNATION. That part of the cycle below the line has a negative value and is referred to 
as a NEGATIVE ALTERNATION. The maximum value, above or below the reference line, is called the 
PEAK AMPLITUDE. The value at any given point along the reference line is called the 
INSTANTANEOUS AMPLITUDE.
