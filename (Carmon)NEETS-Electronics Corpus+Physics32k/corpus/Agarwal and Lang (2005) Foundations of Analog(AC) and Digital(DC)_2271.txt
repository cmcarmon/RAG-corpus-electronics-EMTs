e x e r c i s e 16.1 Determine and graph the v i relation imposed at its port by the
network shown in Figure 16.27. Assume that the diode is ideal.
e x e r c i s e 16.2 Consider the circuit shown in Figure 16.28. Determine and
graph vOUT as a function of vIN for the following two diode models. Clearly label the
breakpoints between neighboring piecewise-linear regions in the graph. In addition, indi-
cate the regions of the graph that correspond to the different on/off state combinations
of the diodes.
