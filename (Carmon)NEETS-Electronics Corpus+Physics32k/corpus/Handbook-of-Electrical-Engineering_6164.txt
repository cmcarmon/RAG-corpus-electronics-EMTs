Personal and ofÔ¨Åce innovations related to communication systems are as dramatic to the ordinary citizen as
those  in  entertainment  applications  such  as  HDTV  and  digital  audio.  Chapter  75  describes  how  facsimile
systems,  which  are  especially  useful  for  rapid  transmission  of  graphical  information,  exploit  standardized
techniques  for  compressing  black-and-white  images.  Also  presented  are  new  developments  in  modulation
techniques  and  propagation  modeling  that  have  been  stimulated  by  mobile  telephone  and  wireless  network
applications.
