In this chapter, ac motors will be divided into (1) series, (2) synchronous, and (3) induction motors.
Single-phase and polyphase motors will be discussed. Synchronous motors, for purposes of this chapter,
may be considered as polyphase motors, of constant speed, whose rotors are energized with dc voltage.
Induction motors, single-phase or polyphase, whose rotors are energized by induction, are the most
commonly used ac motor. The series ac motor, in a sense, is a familiar type of motor. It is very similar to
the dc motor that was covered in chapter 2 and will serve as a bridge between the old and the new.
