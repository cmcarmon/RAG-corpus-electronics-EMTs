Static balance occurs when the centre of gravity of an object is on the axis of rotation. The object can therefore remain stationary, with the axis horizontal, without the application of any braking force. It has no tendency to rotate due to the force of gravity. This is seen in bike wheels where the reflective plate is placed opposite the valve to distribute the centre of mass to the centre of the wheel.For example, :- Grindstones or Car Wheels
