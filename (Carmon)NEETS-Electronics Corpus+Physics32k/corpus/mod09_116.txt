For a given source voltage, the current oscillating between the reactive parts will be stronger at the 
resonant frequency of the circuit than at any other frequency. At frequencies below resonance, capacitive 
current will decrease; above the resonant frequency, inductive current will decrease. Therefore, the 
oscillating current (or circulating current, as it is sometimes called), being the lesser of the two reactive 
currents, will be maximum at resonance.
