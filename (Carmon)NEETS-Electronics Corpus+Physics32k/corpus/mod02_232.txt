CAPACITANCE—Capacitance is the property of a circuit which OPPOSES any CHANGE in the
circuit VOLTAGE. The effect of capacitance may be seen in any circuit where the voltage is changing.
Capacitance is usually defined as the ability of a circuit to store electrical energy. This energy is stored in an
electrostatic field. The device used in an electrical circuit to store this charge (energy) is called a
CAPACITOR. The basic unit of measurement of capacitance is the FARAD (F). A one-farad capacitor will
store one coulomb of charge (energy) when a potential of one volt is applied across the capacitor plates. The
