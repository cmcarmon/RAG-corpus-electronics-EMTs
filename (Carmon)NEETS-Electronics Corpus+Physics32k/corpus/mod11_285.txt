You can divide antennas into two general classes based on directivity, omnidirectional and 
directional. OMNIDIRECTIONAL antennas radiate and receive energy from all directions at once 
(SPHERICAL WAVEFRONT). They are seldom used in modern radar systems as the primary antenna, 
but are commonly used in radio equipment and iff (identification friend or foe) receivers. 
DIRECTIONAL antennas radiate energy in LOBES (or BEAMS) that extend outward from the antenna in 
either one or two directions. The radiation pattern contains small minor lobes, but these lobes are weak 
and normally have little effect on the main radiation pattern. Directional antennas also receive energy 
efficiently from only one or two directions, depending upon whether it is unidirectional or bidirectional.
