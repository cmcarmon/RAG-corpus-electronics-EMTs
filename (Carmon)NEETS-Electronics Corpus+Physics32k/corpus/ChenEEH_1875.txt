In the discussion that follows, we describe the layered QoS
architecture that has been adopted by the UMTS standard
(Garg, 1999; Dixit et al., 2001). In UMTS there is a clear
separation between the radio access network (called UMTS
Terrestrial Radio Access Network or UTRAN), which com-
prises of all the air interface related functions (like medium
access), and the Core Network (CN) that comprises switching-
and control-related functions. Such separation allows both the
CN and the radio access network to evolve independently of
each other. UTRAN and CN exchange information over the Iu
air interface.
