When treating reﬂection problems, there is more than one
plane wave in at least one of the regions: a wave traveling in
the positive z direction (focusing on the z variation) and a
wave traveling in the negative z direction. Often, calculating
power ﬂow in such a region is desired. For a single plane wave,
the complex power density in the z direction (the z component
of the complex Poynting vector) is equal to the complex power
ﬂowing on the corresponding transmission line of the trans-
verse equivalent network. When both an incident and a re-
ﬂected wave are present, or both TMz and TEz waves are
present, the following orthogonality results are useful. These
theorems related to power ﬂow in the z direction may be
proven by direct calculation using the ﬁeld components in
rectangular coordinates.
