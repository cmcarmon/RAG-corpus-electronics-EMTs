An example of a scalar quantity is temperature: the temperature at a given point is a single number. Velocity, on the other hand, is a vector quantity: velocity in three-dimensional space is specified by three values; in a Cartesian coordinate system the values are the speeds along each coordinate axis. The associated fields describe the temperature and velocity in each point of some space. Considering the norms of the velocity vectors results in a scalar field of the speeds in each point of the space.
