of images to be feasible, one needs to reduce somehow this
number of bits. Image compression or coding, is the discip-
line that deals with forms of achieving this. To better under-
stand the image compression problem, consider the 256  256
image in Figure 4.15. If we need to represent this image as it is,
one would need 8 bits/pixel, giving a total of 8  256  256 ¼
524,288 bits. Alternatively, if we know that the image in Figure
4.15 is a circle, it would be enough to say that it represents a
circle of radius 64, it has a gray level of 102, it has a center
coordinates x ¼ 102 and y ¼ 80, and it is superimposed on a
background of gray level 255. Since the radius, x coordinate,
and y coordinate are between 0 and 255, one would need 8 bits
for specifying each one; since both the gray level of the circle
and of the background need 8 bits each, the whole image in
Figure 4.15 would only need 40 bits to be speciﬁed. This is
equivalent to a compression ratio of more than 13,000:1!
