In this case, the quantity inside the radicals in Equations 12.46 and 12.47 is
positive, and so both s1 and s2 are real. For this reason, the dynamic behavior
of vC and iL, as expressed by Equations 12.58 and 12.59, does not exhibit
it involves two real exponential functions that decay at
oscillation. Rather,
different rates, as the two equations show.
The expressions for vC and iL for the case of iL(0) = 0 with over-damping
