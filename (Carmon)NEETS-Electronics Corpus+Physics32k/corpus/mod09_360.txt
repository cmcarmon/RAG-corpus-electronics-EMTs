A TRAPEZOIDAL wave looks like a sawtooth wave on top of a square or rectangular wave, as 
shown in figure 3-1, view (E). The leading edge of a trapezoidal wave is called the JUMP voltage. The 
next portion of the wave is the linear rise or SLOPE. The trailing edge is called the FALL or DECAY. A 
trapezoidal wave is used to furnish deflection current in the electromagnetic cathode ray tube and is found 
in television and radar display systems. Electromagnetic cathode ray tubes use coils for the deflection 
system, and a linear rise in current is required for an accurate horizontal display. The square or 
rectangular wave portion provides the jump voltage for a linear rise in current through the resistance of 
the coil. This will be explained further in a discussion of the trapezoidal sweep generator.
