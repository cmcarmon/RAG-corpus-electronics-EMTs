CALORIMETERS are the most accurate type of test equipment used for measuring high power. As 
power is applied to a calorimeter, its medium (either liquid or solid) is heated. The heat that is produced is 
directly proportional to the amount of applied power. The amount of applied power is determined by 
measuring the change in temperature of the medium.
