The designations used in Table 49.2 reﬂect very few of the many combinations which have been developed.
The PZT designation types were originally designed by the U.S. Navy to reﬂect certain property combinations.
These can be obtained with different combinations of compositions and dopants. The examples given in the
table are representative of typical PZT materials, but today essentially all applications have their own custom
formulation. The name PZT has become generic for the lead zirconate titanates and does not reﬂect Navy or
proprietary designations.
