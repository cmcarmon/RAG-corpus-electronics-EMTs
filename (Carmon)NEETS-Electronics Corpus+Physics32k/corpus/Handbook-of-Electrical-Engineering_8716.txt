machine-level statements. Furthermore, it is much easier for a human programmer to read and write FORTRAN
than to read and write machine-level instructions. One major advantage of a HLL is the obvious improvement
in program creation and, later on, its maintenance. As the size of the program increases, this advantage becomes
larger as we consider the total cost to design, code, test, and enhance an application program.
