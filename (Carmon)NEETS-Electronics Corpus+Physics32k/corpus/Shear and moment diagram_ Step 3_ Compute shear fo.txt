Let V1 and M1 be the shear force and bending moment respectively in a cross-section of the first beam segment. As the section of the beam moves towards the point of application of the external force the magnitudes of the shear force and moment may change. This makes the shear force and bending moment a function of the position of cross-section (in this example x).
By summing the forces along this segment and summing the moments, the equations for the shear force and bending moment are obtained. These equations are:
