Relays
Another component shown in Figure 9.6 is the relay itself.
Relays are controllers that measure input quantities and com-
pare them to thresholds, commonly called relay settings, which
in turn deﬁne operating characteristics. The relay characteris-
tics may be quite different depending on the relaying quantity
used and the relaying principle employed. A few different
operating characteristics of various relays are shown in Figure
9.7. The ﬁrst one is for the relay operating using an overcurrent
principle with an inverse time-delay applied for different levels
of input current. The second one is used by transmission line
relays that operate using an impedance (distance) principle
with the time-step zone implementation.
