Connect the changeover switch to the discharge position by placing the 
free end of the jumper wire into a hole in the same row as the uncon-
nected side of R2. Observe the voltage reading on your meter. You 
should see the reading decrease, as the capacitor discharges through 
resistor R2 to 0Â V. It should take roughly 25 seconds for the capacitor to 
fully discharge.
