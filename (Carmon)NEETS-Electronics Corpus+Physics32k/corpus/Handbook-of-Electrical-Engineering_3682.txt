Figure 36.8 illustrates two additional extrinsic magnetic properties of importance. They are the remanence
coercivity,  Hr ,  and  the  switching  ﬁeld  distribution  (SFD).  These  are  of  particular  importance  in  magnetic
particles  used  in  magnetic  tapes  (audio,  video,  or  data)  or  magnetic  disks.  The  coercivity,  Hc,  of  a  magnetic
material is the value of the magnetic ﬁeld (the major loop) at which M = 0. However, if the applied ﬁeld is
allowed to go to zero, a small magnetization remains. It is necessary to increase the applied ﬁeld from Hc > Hr
(Fig. 36.8) to achieve Mr = 0. Hr is the remanence coercivity and is more relevant than is Hc in discussing the
writing  process  in  magnetic  recording  since  it  corresponds  to  the  center  of  the  remanent  magnetization
transition on the recording medium.
