Nonisolated  Single-Ended  PWM  Converters. The  basic  nonisolated  single-ended  converters  are  (a) buck
(step-down), (b) boost (step-up), (c) buck-boost (step-up or step-down, also referred to as ﬂyback), and (d)
´Cuk converters (Fig. 30.20). The ﬁrst three of these converters have been discussed in Section 30.2. The ´Cuk
converter provides the advantage of nonpulsating input-output current ripple requiring smaller size external
ﬁlters.  Output  voltage  expression  is  the  same  as  the  buck-boost  converter  (refer  to  Section 30.2)  and  can  be
less than or greater than the input voltage. There are many variations of the above basic nonisolated converters,
and  most  of  them  use  a  high-frequency  transformer  for  ohmic  isolation  between  the  input  and  the  output.
Some of them are discussed below.
