Capacitors and inductors can be discussed from a somewhat different point of
view, one that emphasizes the memory aspect of the devices, as introduced in
Equation 9.13 in Section 9.1.1. This section introduces an analysis of capacitor
and inductor circuits based on their state, and will show that this representation
facilitates computer analysis of circuits, which is particularly useful when the
circuit is nonlinear or if it contains a large number of storage elements.
