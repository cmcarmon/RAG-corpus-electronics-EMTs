signal (such as an audio or video signal) must ﬁrst be converted to a digital signal by an analog-
to-digital (A/D) converter. If no analog message is involved, a digital signal (such as the output
of a teletype machine, which is discrete in time and has a ﬁnite number of output characters) can
be directly input.
