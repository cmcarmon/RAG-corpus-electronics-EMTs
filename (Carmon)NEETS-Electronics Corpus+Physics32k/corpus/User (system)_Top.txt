A system user is a person who interacts with a system, typically through an interface, to extract some functional benefit. User-centered design, often associated with humanâ€“computer interaction, considers a wide range of generic systems. System user also defines the behaviour of the system operations and how the audience(end-user) would interact with the system using pre-designed triggers such as buttons/mouse/keyboard. In order for the system to work on a larger scale using various databases system would have to create an interface that would be suitable for specific level of knowledge that the end user acquires.
