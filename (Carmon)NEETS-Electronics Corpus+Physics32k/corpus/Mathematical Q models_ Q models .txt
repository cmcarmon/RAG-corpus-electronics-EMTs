Wang listed the different Q models that Ursin B. and Toverud T. applied in their study, classifying the models into two groups. The first group consists of models 1-5 below, the other group including models 6-8. The main difference between these two groups is the behaviour of the phase velocity when the frequency approaches zero. Whereas the first group has a zero-valued phase velocity, the second group has a finite, nonzero phase velocity.
1) the Kolsky model (linear attenuation)
2) the Strick–Azimi model (power-law attenuation)
3) the Kjartansson model (constant Q)
4) Azimi's second and third models (non-linear attenuation)
5) Müller's model (power-law Q)
6) Standard linear solid Q model for attenuation and dispersion the Zener model (the standard linear solid)
7) the Cole–Cole model (a general linear-solid)
8) a new general linear model
