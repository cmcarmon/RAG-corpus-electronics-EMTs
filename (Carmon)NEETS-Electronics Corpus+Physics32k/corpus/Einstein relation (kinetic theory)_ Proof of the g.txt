The proof of the Einstein relation can be found in many references, for example see Kubo.
Suppose some fixed, external potential energy



U


{\displaystyle U}
generates a conservative force



F

{\displaystyle F(\mathbf {x} )=-\nabla U(\mathbf {x} )}
(for example, an electric force) on a particle located at a given position




x



{\displaystyle \mathbf {x} }
. We assume that the particle would respond by moving with velocity



v

x

)
=

)
F

{\displaystyle v(\mathbf {x} )=\mu (\mathbf {x} )F(\mathbf {x} )}
. Now assume that there are a large number of such particles, with local concentration



ρ
(

x

)


{\displaystyle \rho (\mathbf {x} )}
as a function of the position. After some time, equilibrium will be established: particles will pile up around the areas with lowest potential energy



U


{\displaystyle U}
, but still will be spread out to some extent because of diffusion. At equilibrium, there is no net flow of particles: the tendency of particles to get pulled towards lower



U


{\displaystyle U}
, called the drift current, perfectly balances the tendency of particles to spread out due to diffusion, called the diffusion current (see drift-diffusion equation).
The net flux of particles due to the drift current is

i.e., the number of particles flowing past a given position equals the particle concentration times the average velocity.
The flow of particles due to the diffusion current is, by Fick's law,

{\displaystyle \mathbf {J} _{\mathrm {diffusion} }(\mathbf {x} )=-D(\mathbf {x} )\nabla \rho (\mathbf {x} ),}

where the minus sign means that particles flow from higher to lower concentration.
Now consider the equilibrium condition. First, there is no net flow, i.e.

{\displaystyle \mathbf {J} _{\mathrm {drift} }+\mathbf {J} _{\mathrm {diffusion} }=0}
. Second, for non-interacting point particles, the equilibrium density



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
is solely a function of the local potential energy



U


{\displaystyle U}
, i.e. if two locations have the same



U


{\displaystyle U}
then they will also have the same



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
(e.g. see Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics as discussed below.) That means, applying the chain rule,

{\displaystyle \nabla \rho ={\frac {\mathrm {d} \rho }{\mathrm {d} U}}\nabla U.}

As this expression holds at every position

{\displaystyle D=-\mu {\frac {\rho }{\frac {\mathrm {d} \rho }{\mathrm {d} U}}}.}
