Separate measurements on the device, not illustrated in Figure 15.3, would
indicate that the maximum output current io is about 10 mA for the 741, and
−
−7 amps.
that the input currents i
Thus it is obvious without any formal calculation that the amount of input
power required for the control function is orders of magnitude smaller than the
power that can be controlled at the output.
