Increasingly, designers realize that the key to minimizing the
effects of these overheads is to fully exploit the ﬂexibility of
FPGAs, especially those that can be rapidly reconﬁgured at run
time. We shall adopt a broad interpretation for the term run-
time reconﬁgurability: it includes devices that support only
complete reconﬁguration by the user and those that can be
partially reconﬁgured at run time.
