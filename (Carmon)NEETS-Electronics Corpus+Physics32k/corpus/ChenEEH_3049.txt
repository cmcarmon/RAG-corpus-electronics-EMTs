A special type of transformer is the phase-shifting trans-
former. This type of transformer may or may not transform
the voltage magnitude, but it does change the phase relation-
ship between the output and input voltages. The power trans-
fer through the transformer can be controlled by changing
this phase angle. Details on transformers are provided in
Chapter 3, Power Transformers.
