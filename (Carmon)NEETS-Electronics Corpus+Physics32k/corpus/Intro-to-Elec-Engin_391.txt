When describing and analyzing electric systems, which are often large and complex, it is very
helpful to consider such large systems as being built from smaller units, called building blocks.
These are then the subunits, which can be connected to form larger circuits or systems. More
importantly, the building blocks can be described adequately by their simple terminal properties.
Thus, with the building block point of view, one is not concerned with the interiors of the blocks,
only with how they perform as seen from the outside.
