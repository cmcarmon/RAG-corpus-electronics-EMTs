We shall conclude Part 1 of this book on electric circuits with a treatment of three-phase circuits,
an aspect of circuit theory important to the discussion of electric machines and to the bulk
transfer of electric energy. After explaining the phase sequence of three-phase source voltages,
balanced three-phase loads and power in three-phase circuits are considered. Then the elements
of residential wiring, including grounding and safety considerations, are presented. The chapter
ends with a case study of practical application.
