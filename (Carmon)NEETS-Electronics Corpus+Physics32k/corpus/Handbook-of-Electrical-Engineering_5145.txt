Electrorheological Property
Electrorheological property
 is the property exhibited by certain ﬂuids that are capable of altering their ﬂow
characteristics depending on an external applied electric ﬁeld. These ﬂuids have a fast response time, only a
few milliseconds. Once the external ﬁeld is applied, there is a form of progressive gelling of the ﬂuid proportional
to the applied ﬁeld strength. Without the applied ﬁeld, the ﬂuid ﬂows freely. If the electriﬁed electrorheological
(ER) ﬂuid is sheared by an applied force larger than a certain critical value, it ﬂows. Below this critical value
of applied shear force, the electriﬁed ﬂuid remains in the gel phase [Gandhi and Thompson, 1989].
