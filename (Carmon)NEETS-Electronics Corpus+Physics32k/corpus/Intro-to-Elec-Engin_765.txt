(d) Now consider the single-stage transistor am-
pliﬁer shown in Figure P8.5.6(b). The pa-
rameters of the 2N104 transistor are hie =
1.67 k, hf e = 44, and 1/ hoe = 150 k.
Evaluate the performance of the ampliﬁer by
computing current gain, voltage gain, power
gain, input resistance as seen by the signal
source, and output resistance appearing at the
output terminals.
