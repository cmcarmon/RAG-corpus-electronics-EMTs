The shift register performs serial data transfers in and out of a given pin under the control of an internal
modulo-8 counter. When all the necessary control registers and interrupt handling registers are included with
the data direction registers, together with the ports and counters of direct interest to the user, the device requires
a total of 16 registers. These are individually addressed using four register select pins, RS0â€“RS3.
