Deciding Among Multiple Signals
The preceding results have been developed under the model (73.1)â€“(73.2) that there is a single signal that is
either present or absent. In digital communications applications, it is more common to have the situation in
which we wish to decide between the presence of two (or more) possible signals in a given set of measurements.
The foregoing results can be adapted straightforwardly to such problems. This can be seen most easily in the
case of deciding among known signals. In particular, consider the problem of deciding between two alternatives:
