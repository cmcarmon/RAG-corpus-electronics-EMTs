Switches are sometimes used to control more than one circuit or to select one of several possible
circuits. An example of a switch controlling more than one circuit is the AM/FM selector on a radio. This
switch enables you to control either the AM or FM portion of the radio with a single switch. An example
of a switch that selects one of several circuits is the channel selector of a television set. These switches are
called MULTICONTACT switches because they have more than one contact or MULTI(ple)
CONTACTS.
