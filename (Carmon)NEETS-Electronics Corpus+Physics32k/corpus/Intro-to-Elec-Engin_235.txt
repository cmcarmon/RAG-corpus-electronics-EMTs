EXAMPLE 3.1.5
V, with R = 20 , L = 1
Consider an RLC series circuit excited by v (t ) =
H, and C = 0.1 F. Use the phasor method to Ô¨Ånd the steady-state response current in the circuit.
Sketch the corresponding phasor diagram showing the circuit-element voltages and current. Also
draw the power triangle of the load.
