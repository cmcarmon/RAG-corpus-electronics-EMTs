The prediction of a vapor-liquid equilibrium is successful even in mixtures containing supercritical components.

However, the mixture has to be subcritical. In the given example carbon dioxide is the supercritical component with Tc=304.19 K and Pc=7475 kPa. The critical point of the mixture lies at T=411 K and Pâ‰ˆ15000 kPa. The composition of the mixture is near 78 mole% carbon dioxide and 22 mole% cyclohexane.
PSRK describes this binary mixture quite well, the dew point curve as well as the bubble point curve and the critical point of the mixture.
