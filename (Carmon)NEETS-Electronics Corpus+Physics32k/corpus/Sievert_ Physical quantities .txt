These are directly measurable physical quantities in which no allowance has been made for biological effects. Radiation fluence is the number of radiation particles impinging per unit area per unit time, kerma is the ionising effect of the radiation field, and absorbed dose is the amount of radiation energy deposited per unit mass.
