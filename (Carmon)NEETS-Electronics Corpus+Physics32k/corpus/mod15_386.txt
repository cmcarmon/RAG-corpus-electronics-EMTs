Refer to figure 3-21. Notice that when there is no acceleration, the pendulum remains centered and 
the accelerometer output is zero. However, when there is acceleration the mass or pendulum swings in the 
direction opposite to that of the acceleration, causing an output from the E-transformer. Since the 
amplitude of the pendulum's swing is proportional to the amplitude of the acceleration to which it is 
subjected, the output of the device indicates both the direction and amplitude of the acceleration.  This 
output is within the limits of the equipment and is limited by physical stops.
