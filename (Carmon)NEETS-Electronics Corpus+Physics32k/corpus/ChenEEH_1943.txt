An even better-performing technique can potentially be
developed by using the dynamic reconﬁguration paradigm.
Using such an approach will make it much easier to perform
online testing and diagnosis, to reduce track overhead signiﬁ-
cantly, and to increase the number of possible fault patterns
(and thus reliability) that can be reconﬁgured. Such a tech-
nique is discussed in Subsection 8.3.2.
