Artificial magnets are usually classified as PERMANENT or TEMPORARY, depending on their
ability to retain their magnetic properties after the magnetizing force has been removed. Magnets made
from substances, such as hardened steel and certain alloys which retain a great deal of their magnetism,
are called PERMANENT MAGNETS. These materials are relatively difficult to magnetize because of the
opposition offered to the magnetic lines of force as the lines of force try to distribute themselves
throughout the material. The opposition that a material offers to the magnetic lines of force is called
RELUCTANCE. All permanent magnets are produced from materials having a high reluctance.
