To give you an idea of how intelligence is sent via teletypewriter, let's take a look at the manual 
telegraph circuit. This circuit, shown in figure 3-16, includes a telegraph key, a source of power (battery), 
a sounder, and a movable sounder armature. If the key is closed, current flows through the circuit and the 
armature is attracted to the sounder by magnetism. When the key is opened, the armature is retracted by a 
spring. With these two electrical conditions of the circuit, intelligence can be transmitted by means of a 
teletypewriter code. These two conditions of the circuit are referred to as MARKING and SPACING. The 
marking condition occurs when the circuit is closed and a current flows; the spacing condition occurs 
when it is open and no current flows.
