It turns out that J can be a complicated function of position. So let us
try to answer the preceding question using the continuity equation (derived
from Maxwellâ€™s Equations), which gives the following relationship between the
surface integral of the current out of a closed surface and the time derivative of
the charge enclosed by the surface (see Figure A.7):
