RW Ursae Minoris (Nova Ursae Minoris 1956) is a cataclysmic variable star system that flared up as a nova in the constellation Ursa Minor in 1956. Before the eruption, it had an apparent magnitude of 21 before flaring up to an approximate magnitude of 6. In 2003, it was still two magnitudes brighter than its baseline, and dimming at a rate of 0.02 magnitude a year. Its distance has been calculated as 5000 Â± 800 parsecs (16,300 light-years), which puts its location in the galactic halo.
