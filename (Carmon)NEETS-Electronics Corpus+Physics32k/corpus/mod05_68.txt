The power lost in the form of heat in the armature winding of a generator is known as COPPER 
LOSS. Heat is generated any time current flows in a conductor. Copper loss is an I2R loss, which 
increases as current increases. The amount of heat generated is also proportional to the resistance of the 
conductor. The resistance of the conductor varies directly with its length and inversely with its cross-
sectional area. Copper loss is minimized in armature windings by using large diameter wire.
