In a superconducting generator, the ﬁeld winding is kept at a very low temperature so that it stays super-
conductive. An obvious advantage to this is that no resistive loss can take place in this winding, and therefore
a very large current can ﬂow. A large ﬁeld current yields a very strong magnetic ﬁeld, and this means that many
issues considered important in the conventional design may no longer be critical. For example, the conventional
design makes use of iron core for armature windings to achieve an appropriate level of magnetic ﬂux for these
windings;  iron  cores,  however,  contribute  to  heat  loss—because  of  the  effects  of  hysteresis  and  eddy  cur-
rents—and therefore require appropriate designs for winding insulation. With the new design, there is no need
for iron cores since the magnetic ﬁeld can be made very strong; the absence of iron allows a simpler winding
insulation, thereby accommodating additional armature windings.
