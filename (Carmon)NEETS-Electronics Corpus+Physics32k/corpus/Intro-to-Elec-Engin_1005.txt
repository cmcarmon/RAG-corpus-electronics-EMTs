A dc machine then operates with direct current applied to its ﬁeld winding (generally located
on the salient-pole stator of the machine) and to a commutator (via the brushes) connected to the
armature winding situated inside slots on the cylindrical rotor, as shown schematically in Figure
12.2.4. In a dc machine the stator mmf axis is ﬁxed in space, and the rotor mmf axis is also ﬁxed in
space, even when the rotor winding is physically rotating, because of the commutator action, which
was brieﬂy discussed earlier. Thus, the dc machine will operate under steady-state conditions,
