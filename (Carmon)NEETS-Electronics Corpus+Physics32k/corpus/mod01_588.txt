Equivalent resistance can be found if you know the individual resistance values and the source
voltage. By calculating each branch current, adding the branch currents to calculate total current, and
dividing the source voltage by the total current, the total can be found. This method, while effective, is
somewhat lengthy. A quicker method of finding equivalent resistance is to use the general formula for
resistors in parallel:
