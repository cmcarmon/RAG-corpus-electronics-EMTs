LISA Pathfinder was a proof-of-concept mission to prove that the two masses can fly through space, untouched but shielded by the spacecraft, and maintain their relative positions to the precision needed to realise a full gravitational wave observatory planned for launch in 2034. The primary objective was to measure deviations from geodesic motion. Much of the experimentation in gravitational physics requires measuring the relative acceleration between free-falling, geodesic reference test particles.
In LISA Pathfinder, precise inter-test-mass tracking by optical interferometry allowed scientists to assess the relative acceleration of the two test masses, situated about 38 cm apart in a single spacecraft. The science of LISA Pathfinder consisted of measuring and creating an experimentally-anchored physical model for all the spurious effects – including stray forces and optical measurement limits – that limit the ability to create, and measure, the perfect constellation of free-falling test particles that would be ideal for the LISA follow-up mission.
In particular, it verified:
Drag-free attitude control of a spacecraft with two proof masses,
The feasibility of laser interferometry in the desired frequency band (which is not possible on the surface of Earth), and
The reliability and longevity of the various components—capacitive sensors, microthrusters, lasers and optics.
For the follow-up mission, LISA, the test masses will be pairs of 2 kg gold/platinum cubes housed in each of three separate spacecraft 2.5 million kilometers apart.
