A temperature vs. specific entropy diagram, or T–s diagram, is used in thermodynamics to visualize changes to temperature and specific entropy during a thermodynamic process or cycle. It is a useful and common tool, particularly because it helps to visualize the heat transfer during a process. For reversible (ideal) processes, the area under the T–s curve of a process is the heat transferred to the system during that process.
An isentropic process is depicted as a vertical line on a T–s diagram, whereas an isothermal process is a horizontal line.
