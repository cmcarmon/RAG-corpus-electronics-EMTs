The necessity of using constitutive relations to supplement the Maxwell equations is clear from the following
mathematical observations. In most problems we shall assume that sources of electromagnetic ﬁelds are given.
r
 are known and they satisfy the conservation law (35.5). Let us examine the Maxwell equations
Thus 
and  see  if  there  are  enough  equations  for  the  number  of  unknown  quantities.  There  are  a  total  of  12  scalar
.
  As  we  have  learned,  Eqs.  (35.3)  and  (35.4)  are  not
unknowns  for  the  four  ﬁeld  vectors 
independent equations; they can be derived from Eqs. (35.1), (35.2), and (35.5). The independent equations
are Eqs. (35.1) and (35.2), which constitute six scalar equations. Thus we need six more scalar equations. These
are the constitutive relations.
