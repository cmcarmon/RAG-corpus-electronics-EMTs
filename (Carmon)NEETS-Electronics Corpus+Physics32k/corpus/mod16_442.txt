Because no external power is applied to the component being tested in a resistance check, a logical
question you may ask is, Where does the power for deflection of the ohmmeter come from? The
multimeter contains its own two-battery power supply inside the case. The resistive components inside
the multimeter are of such values that when the leads are connected together (no resistance), the meter
indicates a full-scale deflection. Because there is no resistance between the shorted leads, full-scale
deflection represents zero resistance.
