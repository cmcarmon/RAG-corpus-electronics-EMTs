Incidentally, this is the reason lightning bolts exist as momentary surges rather than con-
tinuous ﬂows of electrons. The voltage built up between the earth and clouds (or between
different sets of clouds) must increase to the point where it overcomes the ionization potential
of the air gap before the air ionizes enough to support a substantial ﬂow of electrons. Once it
does, the current will continue to conduct through the ionized air until the static charge be-
tween the two points depletes. Once the charge depletes enough so that the voltage falls below
another threshold point, the air de-ionizes and returns to its normal state of extremely high
resistance.
