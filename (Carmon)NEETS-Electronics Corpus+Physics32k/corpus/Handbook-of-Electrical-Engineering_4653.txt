The substrate is chosen based on the device design speciﬁcations and includes consideration of operating
temperature,  fractional  bandwidth,  and  insertion  loss.  Second-order  effects  such  as  diffraction  and  beam
steering  are  considered  important  on  high-performance  devices  [Morgan,  1985].  Cost  and  manufacturing
tolerances may also inﬂuence the choice of the substrate material.
