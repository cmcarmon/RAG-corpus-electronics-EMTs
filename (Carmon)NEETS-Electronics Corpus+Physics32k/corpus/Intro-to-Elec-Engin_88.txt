Under dc conditions, an ideal inductor acts like an ideal wire, or short circuit. Note that the
current through an inductor cannot change value instantaneously. However, there is no reason to
rule out an instantaneous change in the value of the inductor voltage. The student should justify
the statements made here by recalling Equation (1.2.27).
