For a planar rigid body, moving in the plane of the body (the x–y plane), and subjected to forces and torques causing rotation only in this plane, the inertial force is

where





r

{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} _{c}}
is the position vector of the centre of mass of the body, and



m

is the mass of the body. The inertial torque (or moment) is

{\displaystyle T_{i}=-I{\ddot {\theta }}}

where



I


{\displaystyle I}
is the moment of inertia of the body. If, in addition to the external forces and torques acting on the body, the inertia force acting through the center of mass is added and the inertial torque is added (acting around the centre of mass is as good as anywhere) the system is equivalent to one in static equilibrium. Thus the equations of static equilibrium

{\displaystyle \sum T}
is the sum of torques (or moments, including the inertial moment and the moment of the inertial force) taken about any point. The direct application of Newton's laws requires that the angular acceleration equation be applied only about the center of mass.
