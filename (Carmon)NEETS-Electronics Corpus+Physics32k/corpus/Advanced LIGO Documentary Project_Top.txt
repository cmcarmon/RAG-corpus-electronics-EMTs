The Advanced LIGO Documentary Project is a collaboration formed in the summer of 2015 among Caltech, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Director Les Guthman to make the definitive documentary about the Advanced LIGO project's search for, and expected first detection of, gravitational waves; and to record a longitudinal video archive of the project for future researchers and historians. The feature documentary, "LIGO," will be completed in the spring of 2018 and released in the fall. A second documentary focusing on the post-discovery era for LIGO and its upcoming third science run will be completed in the spring of 2019.
