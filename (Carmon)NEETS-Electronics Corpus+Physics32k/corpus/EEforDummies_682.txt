So the binary number 1101 is the same as the 
decimal number 13. They’re just two different 
ways of representing the same physical quan-
tity. This is analogous to saying “bonjour” or 
“buenos días” rather than “good day.” They’re 
just different words for the same greeting.
When you add two binary numbers, you use the 
same methodology that is used in the decimal 
system, but using 2 as a base. In the decimal 
system,  1 1 2,  but  in  the  binary  system, 
1 1 10 (remember, the binary number 10 rep-
resents  the  same  quantity  as  the  decimal 
number 2). Computers use the binary system for 
arithmetic operations because the electronic 
circuits inside computers can work easily with 
bits, which are just high or low voltages (or cur-
rents) to them. The circuit that performs addi-
tion  inside  a  computer  contains  several 
transistors arranged in just the right way so that 
when high or low signals representing the bits 
of  two  numbers  are  applied  to  the  transistor 
inputs, the circuit produces the right combina-
tion of high or low outputs to represent the bits 
of the numerical sum. Exactly how this is done 
is beyond the scope of this book, but I hope that 
you now have an idea of how this type of thing 
works.
