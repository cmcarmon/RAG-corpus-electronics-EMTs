The Revised Code of Washington permits speed limits of 75 mph in sections deemed appropriate by an engineering study. As of February 2016, the typical speed limit on a Washington freeway is 70 mph rural, 60 mph urban (the speed limits on these types of freeways only vary in the Tri Cities), with a truck speed limit no higher than 60 mph. The posted truck speed limit does not apply to any auto stage towing a trailer or trucks less than 10,000 pounds gross weight. Limits were raised to current speeds following the elimination of the federal 55 mph speed limit, to more closely reflect the common speeds of traffic at that time. However, Washington State does not have a standard legislated statewide speed limit, leaving it to WSDOT to set individual speed limits for specific segments of road. This has resulted in a wide range of speed limits statewide, with many rural undivided 2 lane highways set at 65 mph, while some congested urban divided highways have limits as low as 40 mph.
The default speed limit on a rural 2-lane highway in Washington is 60; however, the limit on undivided highways varies. In mountainous country like the Cascades and Olympic Mountains, certain twisty roads are limited to 55 mph, whereas some flat, straight highways in eastern Washington have a limit of 65. The speed limit for motorhomes and autos with trailers is 60 like it is for trucks. Roads with traffic lights are limited to 55 mph. The school zone speed limit is 20 mph but is in effect only if children are present. Divided highways in Washington are rare, however, U.S. Route 395 between Pasco and Ritzville is a high-speed divided highway with a maximum speed limit of 70 mph.
Some areas within Washington State use variable speed limits such as on portions of I-90 between Seattle and Issaquah and over Snoqualmie Pass.
On January 23rd, 2017, the WSDOT considered raising the speed limit on I-90 between Ellensburg and Spokane to 75 mph, but decided to retain the 70 mph limit.
