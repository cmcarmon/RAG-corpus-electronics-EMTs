Controlling the timing of the pulse
Resistors R1 and R2 and capacitor C1 control both the width and the on/off 
timing interval of the pulse generated by the 555 timer IC (see ChapterÂ 11 for 
details). This project uses a potentiometer to vary R1 so you can change the 
rate of the blinking light from slow waltz to fast samba.
