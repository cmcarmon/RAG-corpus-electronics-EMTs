Ssb communications systems have some drawbacks. The process of producing an ssb signal is
somewhat more complicated than simple amplitude modulation, and frequency stability is much more
critical in ssb communication. While we donâ€™t have the annoyance of heterodyning from adjacent signals,
a weak ssb signal is sometimes completely masked or hidden from the receiving station by a stronger
signal. Also, a carrier of proper frequency and amplitude must be reinserted at the receiver because of the
direct relationship between the carrier and sidebands.
