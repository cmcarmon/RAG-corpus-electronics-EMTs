Converter Control of AC Machines
Although application of dc drives is quite common, disadvantages are that the machines are bulky and expensive,
and  the  commutators  and  brushes  require  frequent  maintenance.  In  fact,  commutator  sparking  prevents
machine application in an unclean environment, at high speed, and at high elevation. AC machines, particularly
the cage-type induction motor, are favorable when compared with all the features of dc machines. Although
converter  system,  control,  and  signal  processing  of  ac  drives  is  deﬁnitely  complex,  the  evolution  of  ac  drive
technology in the past two decades has permitted more economical and higher performance ac drives. Conse-
quently, ac drives are ﬁnding expanding applications, pushing dc drives towards obsolescence.
