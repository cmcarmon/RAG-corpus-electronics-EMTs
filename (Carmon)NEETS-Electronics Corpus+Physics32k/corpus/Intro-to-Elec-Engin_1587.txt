The essential components of an electric drive controlled by a power semiconductor converter
are shown in the block diagram of Figure 16.1.1. The converter regulates the ﬂow of power from
the source to the motor in such a way that the motor speed–torque and speed–current characteristics
become compatible with the load requirements. The low-voltage control unit, which may consist
of integrated transistorized circuits or a microprocessor, is electrically isolated from the converter-
motor circuit and controls the converter. The sensing unit, required for closed-loop operation or
protection, or both, is used to sense the power circuit’s electrical parameters, such as converter
current, voltage, and motor speed. The command signal forms an input to the control unit, adjusting
the operating point of the drive. The complete electric drive system shown in Figure 16.1.1 must
be treated as an integrated system.
