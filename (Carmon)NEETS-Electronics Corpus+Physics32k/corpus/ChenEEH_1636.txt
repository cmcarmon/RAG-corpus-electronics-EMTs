Each of the data units in an MCU is then processed sepa-
rately. First a two-dimensional (2-D) DCT operation is per-
formed that changes the energy distribution of the original
image and concentrates more information in low frequencies.
The DCT coefﬁcients are then quantized to reduce the magni-
tude of coefﬁcients to be encoded and to reduce some of the
smaller ones to zero. The specs contain two separate quantiza-
tion tables for luminance (Y) and for chrominance (U and V).
The quantized coefﬁcients are then prepared for symbol en-
coding. This is done by arranging them in a zigzag sequence as
shown in the Figure 6.2, with lowest frequencies ﬁrst and the
highest frequencies last, to keep the scores of zero-valued
coefﬁcients at the tail of the variable-length bit stream to be
encoded in the next phase. The assumption is that low-
frequency components tend to occur with higher magnitude,
while the high-frequency ones occur with lower magnitudes;
placing the high frequency components at the end of the
sequence to be encoded is more likely to generate a longer
run of zeros yielding a good overall compression ratio.
