The  weights  now  converge  to  ﬁnite  values.  They  still  deﬁne  in  the  input  space  the  direction  where  the  data
cluster has its largest projection, which corresponds to the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue of the input
correlation matrix [Kung, 1993]. The output of the PE provides the largest eigenvalue of the input correlation
matrix.
