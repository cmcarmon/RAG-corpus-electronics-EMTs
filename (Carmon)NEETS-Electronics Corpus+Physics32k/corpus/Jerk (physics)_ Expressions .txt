Jerk can be formulated in any of the following equivalent ways:

{\displaystyle {\vec {\jmath }}(t)={\frac {\mathrm {d} {\vec {a}}(t)}{\mathrm {d} t}}={\dot {\vec {a}}}(t)={\frac {\mathrm {d} ^{2}{\vec {v}}(t)}{\mathrm {d} t^{2}}}={\ddot {\vec {v}}}(t)={\frac {\mathrm {d} ^{3}{\vec {r}}(t)}{\mathrm {d} t^{3}}}={\overset {...}{\vec {r}}}(t),}

where

{\displaystyle {\vec {a}}}

is velocity,

{\displaystyle {\vec {r}}}
is position,




t


{\displaystyle t}
is time.
There is no universal agreement on the symbol for jerk, but



j


{\displaystyle j}
is commonly used. Newton's notation for the time derivative (

{\displaystyle {\dot {a}},{\ddot {v}},{\overset {...}{r}}}

The fourth derivative of position, equivalent to the first derivative of jerk, is jounce.
The definition of jerk is based on a third derivative. For this reason, in mathematics differential equations of the form

having third derivatives in them, are sometimes called jerk equations. It has been shown that a jerk equation, which is equivalent to a system of three first-order ordinary non-linear differential equations, is in a mathematically well defined sense the minimal setting for solutions showing chaotic behaviour. This motivates mathematical interest in jerk systems. Systems involving a fourth or higher derivative are accordingly called hyperjerk systems.
