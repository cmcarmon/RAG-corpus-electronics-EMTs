For measurements at experimentally controlled pressure, it is assumed that the volume



V



{\displaystyle V\ }
of the body of calorimetric material can be expressed as a function



V
(
T
,
p
)



{\displaystyle V(T,p)\ }
of its temperature



T



{\displaystyle T\ }
and pressure



p



{\displaystyle p\ }
. This assumption is related to, but is not the same as, the above used assumption that the pressure of the body of calorimetric material is known as a function of its volume and temperature; anomalous behaviour of materials can affect this relation.
The quantity that is conveniently measured at constant experimentally controlled pressure, the isobaric volume expansion coefficient, is defined by
