Most natural satellites in the Solar System are in supersynchronous orbits. The Moon is in a supersynchronous orbit of Earth, orbiting more slowly than the 24-hour rotational period of Earth. The inner of the two Martian moons, Phobos, is in a subsynchronous orbit of Mars with an orbital period of only 0.32 days. The outer moon Deimos is in supersynchronous orbit around Mars.
The Mars Orbiter Mission—currently orbiting Mars—is placed into highly elliptical supersynchronous orbit around Mars, with a period of 76.7 hours and a planned periapsis of 365 km (227 mi) and apoapsis of 80,000 km (50,000 mi).
