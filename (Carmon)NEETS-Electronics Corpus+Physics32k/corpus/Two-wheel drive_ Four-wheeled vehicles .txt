For four-wheeled vehicles (and by extension, vehicles with six, eight, or more wheels) this term is used to describe vehicles that are able to power at most two wheels, referred to as either front or rear-wheel drive. The term 4Ã—2 is also used, to denote four total wheels with two being driven. Most road vehicles use a 2WD layout due to its light weight and simplicity. Traction on the road is usually sufficient that the driving force can be reliably transmitted through only two wheels.
For vehicles that have part-time four-wheel drive, the term refers to the mode when 4WD is deactivated and power is applied to only two wheels.
