Many people are happy and excited for the device to be released, however consumers are worried about the price that it will be released for. Users believe that having Windows coming preinstalled on the device will unnecessarily raise the price of the product. Since the device is a great device to be used as an HTPC many consumers want a version without Windows preinstalled so the price will be lower and they can install Ubuntu or XBMC on it to use as a home media device.
