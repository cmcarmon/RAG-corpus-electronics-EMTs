The main benefit of shopping at the surplus electronics retailer is cost: Even 
new components are generally lower priced than at the general electronics 
retailers. On the downside, you may have limited selection — whatever com-
ponents the store was able to purchase. Don’t expect to find every value and 
size of resistor or capacitor, for example.
