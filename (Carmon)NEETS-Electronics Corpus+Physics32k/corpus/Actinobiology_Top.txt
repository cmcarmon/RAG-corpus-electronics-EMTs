Actinobiology is the study of the effects of radiation upon living organisms. Actinobiology has become particularly relevant in space travel due to the abundance of cosmic radiation, which may negatively impact unprotected living organisms in space.
Radiations are the most important physical mutagens. H.J. Muller who used X-rays for the first time to increase the rate of mutation in Drosophila, opened an entirely new field in inducing mutations. So Muller is considered as the 'Father of Actinobiology'.
In 2002, Russian scientists found melanin-rich fungi growing near ground zero at Chernobyl. It was soon discovered that these fungi were using radiation as an energy source in much the same way that plants use the sun for photosynthesis. Radiotrophic bacterium have also been discovered deep underground, feeding on uranium emissions.
