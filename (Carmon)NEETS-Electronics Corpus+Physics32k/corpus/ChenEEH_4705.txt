(11:2)
In equations 11.1 and 11.2, x 2 X; u 2 U ; y 2 Y ; f , g: X!X;
g (x): U!X; h: X!Y ; and f , g , and h are analytic in x. Such
plants can be represented using a so-called bilinear approxi-
mation, obtained by denoting the approximation of the state
and output equations f1(x, u) and f2(x), respectively and by
taking a multivariable Taylor series expansion about the oper-
ating point (x 0, u 0), truncating all terms of order higher than
n, yielding:
