Architect Greg Henderson had been searching for better ways to build safer and more sustainable structures that could withstand the destructive force of earthquakes. In 2015, he was granted a patent for the magnetic levitation of a moving or stationary object. This marked an advancement from present forms of earthquake protection such as base isolation.

Henderson's MFA uses electromagnetic fields to separate an object or structure from the ground and enable propulsion and control. With the understanding that MFA had applications beyond structural isolation, Greg founded the Silicon Valley technology company, Arx Pax, and invented and patented (Patent No: US 9,126,487 B2) Magnetic Field Architecture (MFA) technology. To demonstrate the MFA technology, Arx Pax created the Hendo Hoverboard.
