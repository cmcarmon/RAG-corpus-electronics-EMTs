A  second  signiÔ¨Åcance  is  illustrated  by  our  equivalent  circuit  of  the  npn  bipolar  transistor,  namely,  the
characterization  of  a  class  of  similar  devices.  For  example,  the  parameter  b  in  Eq.  (2.8)  gives  important
information about a single transistor, and similarly for the range of b for a type of transistor. In this connection,
controlled sources lead to a vocabulary for discussing some property of a class of systems or devices, in this
case the current gain of an npn BJT.
