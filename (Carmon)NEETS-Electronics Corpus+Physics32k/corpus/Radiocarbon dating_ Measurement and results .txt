For decades after Libby performed the first radiocarbon dating experiments, the only way to measure the 14C in a sample was to detect the radioactive decay of individual carbon atoms. In this approach, what is measured is the activity, in number of decay events per unit mass per time period, of the sample. This method is also known as "beta counting", because it is the beta particles emitted by the decaying 14C atoms that are detected. In the late 1970s an alternative approach became available: directly counting the number of 14C and 12C atoms in a given sample, via accelerator mass spectrometry, usually referred to as AMS. AMS counts the 14C/12C ratio directly, instead of the activity of the sample, but measurements of activity and 14C/12C ratio can be converted into each other exactly. For some time, beta counting methods were more accurate than AMS, but as of 2014 AMS is more accurate and has become the method of choice for radiocarbon measurements. In addition to improved accuracy, AMS has two further significant advantages over beta counting: it can perform accurate testing on samples much too small for beta counting; and it is much faster â€“ an accuracy of 1% can be achieved in minutes with AMS, which is far quicker than would be achievable with the older technology.
