when selecting a diode for a particular application. 
Assuming that the secondary of T1 provides 12 V 
r.m.s., 
the 
transformer’s secondary winding will be given by:  
 
Vpk = 1.414 × Vr.m.s. = 1.414 × 12 V = 16.97 V 
 
The  peak  voltage  applied  to  D1  will  thus  be 
approximately  17  V.  The  negative  half-cycles  are 
blocked  by  D1  and  thus  only  the  positive  half-
cycles  appear  across  RL. Note,  however,  that  the 
actual  peak  voltage  across  RL will  be  the  17  V 
positive peak being supplied from the secondary on 
T1,  minus  the  0.7  V  forward  threshold  voltage 
dropped by D1. In other words, positive half-cycle 
pulses  having  a  peak  amplitude  of  16.3  V  will 
appear across RL.
