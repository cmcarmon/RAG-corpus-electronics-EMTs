Law of Stimulation
Although action potentials are generated physiologically, it should be obvious that excitable cells can be made
to respond by the application of a negative pulse of sufﬁcient current density (I) and duration (d) to reduce
the transmembrane potential to a critical value by removing charge, thereby reducing the membrane potential
to the threshold potential (TP), as shown in Fig. 113.9. The law of stimulation is I = b/(1 – e–d/t), where b is
the threshold current density for an inﬁnitely long-duration pulse and t  is the cell membrane time constant,
being  different  for  each  type  of  excitable  tissue.  Figure 113.11  is  a  plot  of  the  threshold  current  (I)  versus
duration (d) for mammalian cardiac muscle, sensory receptors, and motor nerve. This relationship is known
as the strength-duration curve.
