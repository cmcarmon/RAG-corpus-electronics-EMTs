If  signals  are  represented  by  voltage  in  a  circuit,  the  power  of  the  signal  is 
proportional  to  the  amount  of  current  drawn  by  the  circuit.  Since  current  draw  is 
dependent on the impedance of the circuit, a high impedance circuit has less power, while 
a low impedance circuit has more power. The function of a buffer amplifier in this case is 
to convert a high impedance circuit to a low impedance circuit. This buffering scenario is 
represented by an equivalent circuit shown in Figure 5.1 where a voltage output electronic 
sensor has relatively high output impedance ZOUT1. If the sensor output is used to drive a 
load impedance, ZLOAD, directly, much of the voltage signal may be lost to attenuation. In 
order to remedy this problem, a buffer amplifier is inserted between the sensor output and 
ZLOAD. The input of the buffer amplifier measures this voltage signal with a high input 
impedance  ZIN,  and  replicates  the  signal  VIN  with  an  output  impedance  ZOUT2.  Since 
ZOUT2  is  smaller  than  ZOUT1,  the  sensor  signal  can  be  used  to  drive  ZLOAD  without 
suffering significant attenuation.
