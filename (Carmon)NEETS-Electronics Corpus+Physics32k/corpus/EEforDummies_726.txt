The 74C00 and 74HC00 are CMOS chips (see the sidebar “Meet the logic fami-
lies,” earlier in this chapter). You may use a different 2‐input NAND, as long 
as you check the pinout and power supply requirements. For instance, the 
4011 is another CMOS 2‐input NAND gate, but it has a different pinout from 
the 74HC00 IC. The 7400 IC is a TTL 2‐input NAND chip with the same pinout
