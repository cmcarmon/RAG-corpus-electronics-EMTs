Radar timing is usually expressed in microseconds. To relate radar timing to distances traveled by
radar energy, you should know that radiated energy from a radar set travels at approximately 984 feet per
microsecond. With the knowledge that a nautical mile is approximately 6,080 feet, we can figure the
approximate time required for radar energy to travel one nautical mile using the following calculation:
