A related device is the fibre optic gyroscope which also operates on the basis of the Sagnac effect, but in which the ring is not a part of the laser. Rather, an external laser injects counter-propagating beams into an optical fiber ring, and rotation of the system then causes a relative phase shift between those beams when interfered after their pass through the fiber ring proportional to the rate of rotation. This is therefore less sensitive than the RLG in which the externally observed phase shift is proportional to the accumulated rotation itself, not its derivative. However the sensitivity of the fiber gyro is enhanced by having a long optical fiber coiled for compactness, but in which the Sagnac effect is multiplied according to the number of turns.
