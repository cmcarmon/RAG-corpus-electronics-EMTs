10. Note, however, that the small-signal gain of each amplifier stage depends on the load offered by
the subsequent stage. Specifically, when computing the small-signal gain, assuming the capacitor
C behaves as a short for the frequencies of interest, the load seen by each of the first and second
stages will not by RL alone, rather it will be RL in parallel with R1 and R2. We saw an example of
a loading effect, specifically a capacitive loading effect, in Section 13.3.4.
