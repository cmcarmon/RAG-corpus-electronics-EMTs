The logic operations you will study in this chapter are the AND, OR, NOT, NAND, and NOR. The
devices that accomplish these operations are called logic gates, or more informally, gates. These gates are
the foundation for all digital equipment. They are the "decision-making" circuits of computers and other
types of digital equipment. By making decisions, we mean that certain conditions must exist to produce
the desired output.
