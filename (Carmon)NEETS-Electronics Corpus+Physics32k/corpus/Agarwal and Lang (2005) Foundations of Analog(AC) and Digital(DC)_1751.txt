We will now proceed to find vCP, and then A1 and A2, for two cases of
vIN, namely a step and an impulse. That is, we will proceed to find the step
response and the impulse response of the circuit. To simplify matters, we will
continue to assume that the circuit is under-damped, that both the step and
the impulse occur at t = 0, and that the circuit is initially at rest prior to that
time. The latter assumption suggests that we are interested in the zero-state
response7 and provides these initial conditions
vC(0) = 0
iL(0) = 0
