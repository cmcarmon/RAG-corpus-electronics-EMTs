A typical value for a µA 741 is 80 nA; for a µA 771 it is 50 pA. When the resistance of the source
feeding the op amp is large enough, the input bias current may have an adverse effect. As shown
in Figure 5.3.6, where the noninverting input is grounded and the inverting input is connected
to a source of 1-M resistance and of voltage vS momentarily at 0 V, the bias current of 80 nA
generates a voltage of −80 mV on the noninverting input.
