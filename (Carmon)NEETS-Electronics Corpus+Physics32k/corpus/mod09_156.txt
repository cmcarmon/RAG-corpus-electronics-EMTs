If circuit Q is low, the gain of the circuit at resonance is relatively small. The circuit does not 
discriminate sharply (reject the unwanted frequencies) between the resonant frequency and the 
frequencies on either side of resonance, as shown by the curve in figure 1-12, view (A). The range of 
frequencies included between the two frequencies (426.4 kHz and 483.6 kHz in this example) at which 
the current drops to 70 percent of its maximum value at resonance is called the BANDWIDTH of the 
circuit.
