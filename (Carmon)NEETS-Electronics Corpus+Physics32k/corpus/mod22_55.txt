Next came electronic computers. The early electronic computers' mathematical processes were 
solved by using electrical voltages only, applied to elements such as amplifiers, summing networks, 
differentiating, and integrating circuits. The weak link in this type of electrical computation was the 
vacuum tube. To correct this, transistors which consume less power and last longer than vacuum tubes 
were used in the amplifiers. Through technological research and development, we have progressed from 
tubes, to transistors, to miniaturized circuits, to integrated circuitry. These advances have made it possible 
to reduce the size and weight of our computers. Figure 1-4 is an example of one of our modern electronic 
digital computers.
