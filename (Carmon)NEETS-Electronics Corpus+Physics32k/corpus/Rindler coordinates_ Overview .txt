Kottler-Møller and Rindler coordinates
Albert Einstein (1907) studied the effects within a uniformly accelerated frame, obtaining equations for coordinate dependent time dilation and speed of light equivalent to (2c), and in order to make the formulas independent of the observer's origin, he obtained time dilation (2i) in formal agreement with Radar coordinates. While introducing the concept of Born rigidity, Max Born (1909) noted that the formulas for hyperbolic motion can be used as transformations into a "hyperbolically accelerated reference system" (German: hyperbolisch beschleunigtes Bezugsystem) equivalent to (2d). Born's work was further elaborated by Arnold Sommerfeld (1910) and Max von Laue (1911) who both obtained (2d) using imaginary numbers, which was summarized by Wolfgang Pauli (1921) who besides coordinates (2d) also obtained metric (2e) using imaginary numbers. Einstein (1912) studied a static gravitational field and obtained the Kottler-Møller metric (2b) as well as approximations to formulas (2a) using a coordinate dependent speed of light. Hendrik Lorentz (1913) obtained coordinates similar to (2d, 2e, 2f) while studying Einstein's equivalence principle and the uniform gravitational field.
A detailed description was given by Friedrich Kottler (1914), who formulated the corresponding orthonormal tetrad, transformation formulas and metric (2a, 2b). Also Karl Bollert (1922) obtained the metric (2b) in his study of uniform acceleration and uniform gravitational fields. In a paper concerned with Born rigidity, Georges Lemaître (1924) obtained coordinates and metric (2a, 2b). Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen (1935) described (2d, 2e) as the "well known" expressions for a homogeneous gravitational field. After Christian Møller (1943) obtained (2a, 2b) in as study related to homogeneous gravitational fields, he (1952) as well as Misner & Thorne & Wheeler (1973) used Fermi-Walker transport to obtain the same equations.
While these investigations were concerned with flat spacetime, Wolfgang Rindler (1960) analyzed hyperbolic motion in curved spacetime, and showed (1966) the analogy between the hyperbolic coordinates (2d, 2e) in flat spacetime with Kruskal coordinates in Schwarzschild space. This influenced subsequent writers in their formulation of Unruh radiation measured by an observer in hyperbolic motion, which is similar to the description of Hawking radiation of black holes.

, beyond which no signal can reach the observer in hyperbolic motion. This was called the "horizon of the observer" (German: Horizont des Beobachters) by Bollert (1922). Rindler (1966) demonstrated the relation between such an horizon and the horizon in Kruskal coordinates.
Radar coordinates
Using Bollert's formalism, Stjepan Mohorovičić (1922) made a different choice for some parameter and obtained metric (2h) with a printing error, which was corrected by Bollert (1922b) with another printing error, until a version without printing error was given by Mohorovičić (1923). In addition, Mohorovičić erroneously argued that metric (2b, now called Kottler-Møller metric) is incorrect, which was rebutted by Bollert (1922). Metric (2h) was rediscovered by Harry Lass (1963), who also gave the corresponding coordinates (2g) which are sometimes called "Lass coordinates". Metric (2h), as well as (2a, 2b), was also derived by Fritz Rohrlich (1963). Eventually, the Lass coordinates (2g, 2h) were identified with Radar coordinates by Desloge & Philpott (1987).
