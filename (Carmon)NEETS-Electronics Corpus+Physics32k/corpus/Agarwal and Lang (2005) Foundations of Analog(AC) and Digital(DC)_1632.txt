This style of building logic gates using n-channel MOSFETs for both the
pullups and the pulldowns is called NMOS logic.3 The RON of the pullup
serves as the load resistor. The gate length of the pullup MOSFET is sized to
be larger relative to the pulldown MOSFET, so the static discipline is satisfied
(see Section 6.11). The power and energy calculations of Section 11.3 apply to
NMOS devices with RON of the pullup replacing the load resistor RL in the
analyses.
