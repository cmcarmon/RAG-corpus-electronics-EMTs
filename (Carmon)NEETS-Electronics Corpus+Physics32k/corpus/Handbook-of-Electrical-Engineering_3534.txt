Logic  synthesis  optimizes  the  logic  generated  by  register  transfer  synthesis  and  maps  the  optimized  logic
operations onto physical gates supported by the target fabrication technology. Technology mapping considers
the foundry cell library and associated electrical restrictions, such as
