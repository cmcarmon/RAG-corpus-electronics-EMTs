The new scoring procedure was accepted on the EC Meeting in 2010. "Scoring guidelines" were drafted before the tournament in Tehran especially to standardize the marks of jury in all rooms during selective fights.
It was suggested in the EC Meeting in November 2009 to increase number of rejected problems from three to five, but EC members did not support the idea. However, EC suggests changing the procedure of PFs in the following way:

The first four PFs run as usual. In the fifth PF, teams from the first three, second three, third three etc. positions meet. In this PF, every team can choose a problem for presentation, as long as it was not presented by that team during the previous PFs. The same problem can not be presented in final, neither. The priority of selection is given by the position in scoring after four rounds. Points from the fifth PF will be summed up with the points from the four initial PF as usual.

This procedure could lead to two basic things: firstly, all teams will have an opportunity to present their best solution, even if they do not reach the final. Secondly, the neighboring teams from the scoring list after four rounds will meet and have the opportunity to fight against each other, discussing the solutions with other teams on the same/similar level. Especially in the first and second group the competition for the final and in the second and third group the competition for the silver medals will be more direct and more interesting for the students. Such a change of regulation has to be discussed in the IOC and can be applied later.
