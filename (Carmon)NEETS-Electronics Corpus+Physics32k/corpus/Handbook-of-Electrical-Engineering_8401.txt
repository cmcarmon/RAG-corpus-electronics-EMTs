A ﬁfth desirable characteristic of a number system to be used in a computer should be that it have a minimum
number  of  easily  identiﬁable  states.  The  binary  number  system  satisﬁes  this  condition.  However,  the  digital
computer must still interface with humankind. This is done by converting the binary data to a decimal and
character-based form that can be readily understood by humans. A minimum number of identiﬁable characters
(say 1 and 0, or true and false) is not practical or desirable for direct human use. If this is difﬁcult to understand,
imagine trying to complete a tax form in binary or in any number system other than decimal. On the other
hand, use of a computer for this purpose would not only be practical but, in many cases, highly desirable.
