The frequency regularly changes 40 megahertz with respect to time; therefore, its value at any time
during its cycle can be used as the basis for computing the time elapsed after the start of the frequency
cycle. For example, at T0 the transmitter sends a 420-megahertz signal toward an object. It strikes the
object and returns to the receiver at T1, when the transmitter is sending out a new frequency of 440
megahertz. At T1, the 420-megahertz returned signal and the 440-megahertz transmitter signal are fed to
the receiver simultaneously. When the two signals are mixed in the receiver, a beat frequency results. The
beat frequency varies directly with the distance to the object, increasing as the distance increases. Using
this information, you can calibrate a device that measures frequency to indicate range.
