A cell is a device that transforms chemical energy into electrical energy. The simplest cell, known as 
either a galvanic or voltaic cell, is shown in figure 2-1. It consists of a piece of carbon (C) and a piece of 
zinc (Zn) suspended in a jar that contains a solution of water (H20) and sulfuric acid (H2S0 4) called the 
electrolyte.
