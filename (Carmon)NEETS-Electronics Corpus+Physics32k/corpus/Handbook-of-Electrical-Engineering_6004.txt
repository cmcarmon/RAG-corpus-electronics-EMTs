network connected to the machine may not be in phase variables. For example, in linearized analysis, and also
in  transient  stability  of  power  systems,  the  network  representation  is  usually  in  a  synchronously  rotating
reference  frame.  In  linearized  analysis,  the  small-signal  representation  of  the  system  is  obtained  by  making
small perturbations about an operating point. When the machines are in their respective rotor qd0 reference
frames  and  the  power  network  is  in  a  synchronously  rotating  qd0  reference  frame,  the  qd0  variables  of  the
network and machines are in steady-state; thus linearized analysis about an operating point can be performed.
In transient stability, the main interest is the stability of the system after some large disturbances. The models
employed are to portray the transient behavior of the power ï¬‚ows in the network and the electromechanical
response of the machines. When dealing with large networks, the fast electromagnetic transients of the network
are usually ignored and a static network representation is used. At each new time step of the dynamic simulation,
an update of the network condition can be obtained by solving the phasor equations of the static network along
with  power  or  current  injections  from  the  machines.  Because  the  phasor  quantities  of  the  network  can  be
expressed as qd components of a synchronously rotating qd0 reference [Ong, 1998], the exchange of voltage
variables between network and machine at the bus will require a rotational transformation given below
