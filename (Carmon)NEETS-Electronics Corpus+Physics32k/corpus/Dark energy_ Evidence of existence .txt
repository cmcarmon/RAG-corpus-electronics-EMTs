The evidence for dark energy is indirect but comes from three independent sources:
Distance measurements and their relation to redshift, which suggest the universe has expanded more in the last half of its life.
The theoretical need for a type of additional energy that is not matter or dark matter to form the observationally flat universe (absence of any detectable global curvature).
It can be inferred from measures of large scale wave-patterns of mass density in the universe.
