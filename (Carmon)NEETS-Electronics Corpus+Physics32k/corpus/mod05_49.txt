For the remainder of this discussion, refer to figure 1-4, parts A through D. This will help you in 
following the step-by-step description of the operation of a dc generator. When the armature loop rotates 
clockwise from position A to position B, a voltage is induced in the armature loop which causes a current 
in a direction that deflects the meter to the right. Current flows through loop, out of the negative brush, 
through the meter and the load, and back through the positive brush to the loop. Voltage reaches its 
maximum value at point B on the graph for reasons explained earlier. The generated voltage and the 
current fall to zero at position C. At this instant each brush makes contact with both segments of the 
commutator. As the armature loop rotates to position D, a voltage is again induced in the loop. In this 
case, however, the voltage is of opposite polarity.
