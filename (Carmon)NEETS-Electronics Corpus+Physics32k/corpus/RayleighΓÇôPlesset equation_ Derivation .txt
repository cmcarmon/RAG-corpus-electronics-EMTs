The Rayleigh–Plesset equation can be derived entirely from first principles using the bubble radius as the dynamic parameter. Consider a spherical bubble with time-dependent radius



R
(
t
)


{\displaystyle R(t)}
, where



t


{\displaystyle t}
is time. Assume that the bubble contains a homogeneously distributed vapor/gas with a uniform temperature




T

B


(
t
)


{\displaystyle T_{B}(t)}
and pressure




P

B


(
t
)


{\displaystyle P_{B}(t)}
. Outside the bubble is an infinite domain of liquid with constant density




ρ

L




{\displaystyle \rho _{L}}
and dynamic viscosity




μ

L




{\displaystyle \mu _{L}}
. Let the temperature and pressure far from the bubble be




T

∞




{\displaystyle T_{\infty }}
and




P

∞


(
t
)


{\displaystyle P_{\infty }(t)}
. The temperature




T

∞




{\displaystyle T_{\infty }}
is assumed to be constant. At a radial distance



r


{\displaystyle r}
from the center of the bubble, the varying liquid properties are pressure



P
(
r
,
t
)


{\displaystyle P(r,t)}
, temperature



T
(
r
,
t
)


{\displaystyle T(r,t)}
, and radially outward velocity



u
(
r
,
t
)


{\displaystyle u(r,t)}
. Note that these liquid properties are only defined outside the bubble, for



r
≥
R
(
t
)


{\displaystyle r\geq R(t)}
.
