The  Resource  Manager  is  a  key  component  of  the  PC/SC  architecture.  It  is  responsible  for  managing  the
other resources (such as service providers) within the system and for controlling access to the smart card readers
and to the card itself. The Resource Manager is provided by the operating system vendor. Thus, the Resource
Manager is responsible for identiÔ¨Åcation and tracking of resources. This includes the tracking of the readers,
of the smart cards, of the service providers, of the supported interfaces and of the smart card insertion and
removal events. Thus, the Resource Manager can list the available resources to each application.
