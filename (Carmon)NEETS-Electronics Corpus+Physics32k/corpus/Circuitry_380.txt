on  the  collector-emitter  voltage  axis  and  (18V/1.2 
kP or  15  mA)  on  the  collector  current  axis.  Next 
we locate the operating point (or quiescent point)
from  the  point  of  intersection  of  the  IB = 30  µA 
characteristic and the load line.  
  Having  located  the  operating  point  we  can  read 
off  the  quiescent  (no-signal)  values  of  collector 
emitter  voltage  (VCQ) and  collector  current  (ICQ). 
Hence: 
 
VCQ = 9.2 V and ICQ = 7.3 mA 
 
Next  we  can  determine 
the  maximum  and 
minimum  values  of  collector-emitter  voltage  by 
locating  the  appropriate  intercept  points  on  Fig. 
7.37.  
  Note that the maximum and minimum values of 
base  current  will  be  (30 µA  +  20 µA)  on  positive 
peaks  of  the  signal  and  (30  µA  I 20  µA)  on 
negative  peaks  of  the  signal.  The  maximum  and 
minimum  values  of  VCE  are,  respectively,  14.8  V 
and 3.3 V. Hence the output voltage swing will be 
(14.8 V I 3. 3 V) or 11.5 V peak-peak.
