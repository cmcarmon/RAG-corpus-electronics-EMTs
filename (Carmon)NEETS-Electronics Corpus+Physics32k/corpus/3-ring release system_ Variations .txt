There are a few different variations of the 3-ring system. The original 3-ring release from the late 1970s is now known as large 3-rings. A version using smaller rings (mini rings) was introduced in the 1980s. The reasons for the development of the mini ring system and the associated smaller risers were mostly aesthetic; the mini rings do not increase safety but actually reduce the mechanical advantage inherent in the system thereby increasing the pull force a jumper must apply to cut-away. Tandem systems still use rings that are even larger than the original rings, and some tandem rigs even use four rings (e.g., Advance Tandem by Basik). Other variations have placed the rings under the risers facing back instead of forward of the risers facing front or varied the geometry of the rings for example using an elongated middle ring for a claimed improvement in mechanical advantage on Aerodyne's miniforce system.
