Doctor Octopus has been recreated in action figure form multiple times, first as part of Mattel's Secret Wars line, then later many times by Toy Biz in their Spider-Man and Marvel Legends series, and finally by Hasbro as part of their Spider-Man: Origin series. The movie figure will also be featured in Hasbro's Marvel Legends Spider-Man 3 wave. The action feature from this figure was removed. Hasbro released a Spectacular Spider-Man action figure later.
A Doctor Octopus figure was released in 2004 as part of the Marvel Manga Twist'ems line with wind up tentacles.
Doctor Octopus has also been recreated in several statues and mini-busts, by the likes of Diamond Select, Art Asylum and Bowen Designs.
Doctor Octopus is the third figurine in the Classic Marvel Figurine Collection.
