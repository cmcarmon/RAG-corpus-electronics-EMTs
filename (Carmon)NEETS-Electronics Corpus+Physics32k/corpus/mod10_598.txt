The electromagnetic radiation from an antenna is made up of two components, the E field and the H 
field. We discussed these fields in chapters 1 and 2. The two fields occur 90 degrees out of phase with 
each other. These fields add and produce a single electromagnetic field. The total energy in the radiated 
wave remains constant in space except for some absorption of energy by the Earth. However, as the wave 
advances, the energy spreads out over a greater area and, at any given point, decreases as the distance 
increases.
