We begin by learning how to obtain the initial conditions for the
circuit  variables  and  their  derivatives,  as  this  is  crucial  to  analyzing
second-order  circuits. Then  we  consider  series  and  parallel RLC cir-
cuits  such  as  shown  in  Fig.  8.1  for  the  two  cases  of  excitation:  by
initial  conditions  of  the  energy  storage  elements  and  by  step  inputs.
Later  we  examine  other  types  of  second-order  circuits,  including  op
amp  circuits.  We  will  consider  PSpice analysis  of  second-order  cir-
cuits.  Finally,  we  will  consider  the  automobile  ignition  system  and
smoothing circuits as typical applications of the circuits treated in this
chapter.  Other  applications  such  as  resonant  circuits  and  Ô¨Ålters  will
be covered in Chapter 14.
