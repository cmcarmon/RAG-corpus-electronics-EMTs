Figure 29.9 introduces the symbolic representation of a gyrator and shows its use in simulating an inductor.
The gyrator can conveniently be realized by the circuit of Fig. 29.10(a), but note that the simulated inductor
is grounded at one end. This presents no problem in the case of high-pass ﬁlters and other forms requiring a
grounded shunt inductor but is not suitable for the low-pass ﬁlter. Figure 29.10(b) shows how a pair of back-
to-back gyrators can be conﬁgured to produce a ﬂoating inductance, but this involves four op amps per inductor.
The next section will introduce an alternative approach that avoids the op amp count difﬁculty associated
