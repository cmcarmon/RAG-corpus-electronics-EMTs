At T2 the 3-volt valley point of the unijunction has been reached. The emitter now becomes reverse 
biased and the impedance from the emitter to B1 returns to a high value. Immediately after T2, Q1 is 
reverse biased and the capacitor has a charge of approximately 3 volts. C1 now starts to charge toward 20 
volts as it did originally (just after T0). This is shown from T2 to T3 in figure 3-44, view (B).
