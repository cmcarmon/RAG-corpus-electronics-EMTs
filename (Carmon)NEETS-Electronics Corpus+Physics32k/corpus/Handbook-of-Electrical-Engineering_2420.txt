Resist  development  is  simulated  based  on  a  model  introduced  by  Dill  [1975].  The  development  process  is
treated  as  a  surface-etching  phenomenon,  with  the  etch  rate  depending  only  on  the  local  concentration  of
inhibitor. The evolution of the surface with development time can therefore be treated by the same evolution
algorithms used in etching and deposition simulation.
