most common disks have 11-in diameters and 200 tracks (concentric rings of data) per surface,
numbered from 0 to 199, starting with the outside perimeter of the disk, with a typical track
packing density of 4000 bits per inch. Disks are mounted on a common spindle, and all disks
rotate at a typical speed of 3600 revolutions per minute (rpm). A typical disk has 17 sectors of
Ô¨Åxed size per track and 512 bytes (1 byte = 8 bits) of information per sector. Any desired sector
can be quickly accessed.
