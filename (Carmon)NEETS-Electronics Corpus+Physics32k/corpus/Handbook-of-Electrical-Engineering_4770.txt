the tetragonal axis). Experimentally it is found, however, that the material breaks up into smaller regions in
which the preferred direction and thus the polarization is uniform. Note that cubic materials have no preferred
direction. In tetragonal crystals the polarization points along the c-axis (the longer axis) whereas in rhombo-
hedral lattices the polarization is along the body diagonal. The volume in which the preferred axis is pointing
in the same direction is called a domain and the border between the regions is called a domain wall. The energy
of the multidomain state is slightly lower than the single-domain state and is thus the preferred conﬁguration.
The direction of the polarization changes by either 90(cid:176) or 180(cid:176) as we pass from one uniform region to another.
Thus the domains are called 90(cid:176) and 180(cid:176) domains. Whether an individual crystallite or grain consists of a single
domain depends on the size of the crystallite and external parameters such as strain gradients, impurities, etc. It is
also possible that the domain extend beyond the grain boundary and encompasses two or more grains of the crystal.
Real materials consist of large numbers of unit cells, and the manifestation of the individual charged groups is
an  internal  and  an  external  electric  ﬁeld  when  the  material  is  stressed.  Internal  and  external  refer  to  inside  and
outside of the material. The interaction of an external electric ﬁeld with a charged group causes a displacement of
certain atoms in the group. The macroscopic manifestation of this is a displacement of the surfaces of the material.
This motion is called the piezoelectric effect, the conversion of an applied ﬁeld into a corresponding displacement.
