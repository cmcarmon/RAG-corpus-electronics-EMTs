In figure 3-63(B), the ground, or reference point has been moved to point B. The current in the
circuit is still .5 amp and each resistor still develops 25 volts. The total voltage developed in the circuit
remains at 100 volts, but because the reference point has been changed, the voltage at point A is negative
25 volts. Point E, which was at positive 100 volts in figure 3-63(A), now has a voltage of positive 75
volts. As you can see the voltage at any point in the circuit is dependent on three factors; the current
through the resistor, the ohmic value of the resistor, and the reference point in the circuit.
