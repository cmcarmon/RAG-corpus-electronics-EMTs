A frequency that meets the above criteria has been established and is known as the OPTIMUM 
WORKING FREQUENCY. It is abbreviated "fot" from the initial letters of the French words for 
optimum working frequency, "frequence optimum de travail." The fot is roughly about 85 percent of the 
muf but the actual percentage varies and may be either considerably more or less than 85 percent.
