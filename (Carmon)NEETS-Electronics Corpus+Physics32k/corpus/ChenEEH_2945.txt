discussions in this chapter are from the mathematical point of
view. In practice, one can incorporate prior knowledge or
some constraints in the reconstruction operation to limit the
range of possible solutions. In addition, more measured data at
multiple frequencies and/or from multiview illumination will
be helpful for the stabilization of the solution.
