Conclusions
Various  active  solid-state  devices  that  are  useful  at  microwave  and  millimeter-wave  frequencies  have  been
discussed. Both two-terminal and three-terminal devices were included. The most commonly used two-terminal
devices are tunnel diodes, transferred-electron devices, and IMPATT diodes. Three-terminal devices consist of
various forms of Ô¨Åeld-effect transistors and bipolar transistors. Recent advances employ heterostructures using
combinations  of  different  semiconductors  to  produce  devices  with  improved  RF  performance,  especially  for
high-frequency applications. Both two-terminal and three-terminal devices can provide useful gain at frequen-
cies in excess of 100 GHz. Further improvements are likely as fabrication technology continues to improve.
