The tube types you studied in the first chapter have one serious drawback; namely, they are not
suitable as power amplifiers. Because of high-plate resistance and internal construction, tubes such as the
triode, tetrode, and pentode are used only as voltage amplifiers. When power amplification is required
(high-current requirements), special-purpose tubes called POWER PENTODES and BEAM POWER
tubes are used.
