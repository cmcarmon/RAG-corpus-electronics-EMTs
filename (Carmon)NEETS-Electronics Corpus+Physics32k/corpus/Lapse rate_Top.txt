Lapse rate is the rate at which Earth's atmospheric temperature decreases with an increase in altitude, or increases with the decrease in altitude.  Lapse rate arises from the word lapse, in the sense of a gradual change.
Although this concept is most often applied to Earth's troposphere, lapse rate can be extended to any gravitationally supported parcel of gas.
