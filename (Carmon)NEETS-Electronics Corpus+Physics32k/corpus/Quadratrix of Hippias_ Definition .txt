Consider a square ABCD with an inscribed quarter circle centered in A, such that the side of the square is the circle's radius. Let E be a point that travels with a constant angular velocity on the quarter circle arc from D to B. In addition the point F travels with a constant velocity from D to A on the line segment AD, in such a way that E and F start at the same time at D and arrive at the same time in B and A. Now the quadratrix is defined as the locus of the intersection of the parallel to AB through F and the line segment AE.
If one places such a square ABCD with side length a in a (cartesian) coordinate system with the side AB on the x-axis and vertex A in the origin, then the quadratix is described by a planar curve

This description can also be used to give an analytical rather than a geometric definition of the quadratrix and to extend it beyond the

To describe the quadratrix as simple function rather than planar curve, it is advantageous to switch the y-axis and the x-axis, that is to place the side AB on y-axis rather than on the x-axis. Then the quadratrix is given by the following function f(x):
