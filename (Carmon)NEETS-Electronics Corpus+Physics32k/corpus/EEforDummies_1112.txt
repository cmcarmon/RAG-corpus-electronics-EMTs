Because resistance or (for that matter) lack of resistance can reveal short 
circuits and open circuits, you can use your ohmmeter to sniff out problems 
such as breaks in wires and hidden shorts between components. A short 
circuit generates an ohmmeter reading of zero (or virtually zero) resistance; 
an open circuit generates a readout of infinite resistance. If you test the resis-
tance from one end of a wire to the other and you get an infinite readout, you 
know there must be a break somewhere along the length of the wire. Such 
tests are known as continuity tests.
