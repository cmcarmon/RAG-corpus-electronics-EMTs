ui of Eq.
(48.2) is represented by a phasor, u. The time derivative of the particle displacement is the particle velocity and
is represented by a phasor, v = jvu, which is taken as analogous to the current on the one-dimensional electrical
transmission line. The negative of the stress, or the force per unit area, caused by the particle displacement is
represented by a phasor, (–T) = jkcu, which is taken as analogous to the voltage on the transmission line. Here
c is the appropriate stiffened elastic constant for the mode in question in Eq. (48.3). With these deﬁnitions, the
general impedance, the characteristic impedance, the phase velocity, and the wave vector, respectively, of the
equivalent line are given by
