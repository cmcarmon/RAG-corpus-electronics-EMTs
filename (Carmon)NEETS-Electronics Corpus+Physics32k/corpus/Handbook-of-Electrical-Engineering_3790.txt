Every type of waveguide has an inﬁnite number of distinct electromagnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations that can exist
inside it. Each of these conﬁgurations is called a waveguide mode. The characteristics of these modes depend
upon  the  cross-sectional  dimensions  of  the  conducting  cylinder,  the  type  of  dielectric  material  inside  the
waveguide, and the frequency of operation.
