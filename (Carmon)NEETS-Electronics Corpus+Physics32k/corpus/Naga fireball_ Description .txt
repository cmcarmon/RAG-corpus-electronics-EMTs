The fireballs are most often reported around the night of Wan Ok Phansa at the end of the Buddhist Lent in late-October.
Naga fireballs have been reported over an approximately 250 kilometre long section of Mekong river with the centre of this section approximately at Phon Phisai town in Amphoe Phon Phisai. Balls have also been reported rising from smaller rivers, lakes and ponds in this region.
