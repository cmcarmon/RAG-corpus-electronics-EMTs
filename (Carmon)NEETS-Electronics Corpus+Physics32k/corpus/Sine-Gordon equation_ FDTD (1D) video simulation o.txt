The following video shows a simulation of two parking solitons. Both send out a pressure-speed field with different polarity. Because the end of the 1D space is not termicated symmetricly - waves are reflected.

Lines in the video:
1) Cos() part of the soliton. 2) Sin() part of the soliton. 3) Angle acceleration of the soliton. 4) Pressure-Component of the field with different polarity. 5) Speed-Component of the field - direction dependent.
Steps:
1) Solitons send out not bound energy as waves. 2) Solitons send the p-v-field which reaches the peer. 3) Solitons begin to move. 4) They meet in the middle and annihilate. 5) Mass is spread as wave.
