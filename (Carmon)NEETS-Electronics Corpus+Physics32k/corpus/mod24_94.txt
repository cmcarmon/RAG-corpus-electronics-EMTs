If the surface of the medium contacted by the incident wave is smooth and polished, each reflected
wave will be reflected back at the same angle as the incident wave. The path of the wave reflected from
the surface forms an angle equal to the one formed by its path in reaching the medium. This conforms to
the law of reflection which states: The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.
