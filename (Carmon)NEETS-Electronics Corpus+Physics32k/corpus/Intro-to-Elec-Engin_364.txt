The body resistance of a normal person ranges from 500 k down to 1 k, depending upon
whether the skin is dry or wet. Thus, a person with wet skin risks electrocution from ac voltages
as low as 100 V. The amount of current is the key factor in electric shock, and Table 4.4.1 lists
the effects of various levels of 60-Hz ac current on the human body. Note that the 100â€“300-mA
range turns out to be the most dangerous.
