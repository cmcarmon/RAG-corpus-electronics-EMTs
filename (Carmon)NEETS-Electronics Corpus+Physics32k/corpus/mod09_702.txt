RESONANCEâ€”The condition in a circuit containing inductance and capacitance in which the inductive
reactance is equal and opposite to the capacitive reactance. This condition occurs at only one
frequency and the circuit in that condition is said to be in resonance. The resonant frequency can be
changed by varying the values of either the capacitance or inductance.
