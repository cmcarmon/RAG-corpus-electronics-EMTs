First, let's consider some of the more common problem areas you should avoid when working with 
synchros. As with any piece of electrical or electronic equipment, if it worksâ€”leave it alone. Do not 
attempt to zero a synchro system that is already zeroed just because you want to practice. More often than 
not, the system will end up more out of alignment than it was before you attempted to rezero it. Do not 
attempt to take a synchro apart, even if it is defective. A synchro is a piece of precision equipment that 
requires special equipment and techniques for disassembly. Disassembly should be done only by qualified 
technicians in authorized repair shops. A synchro, unlike an electric motor, does not require periodic 
lubrication. Therefore, never attempt to lubricate a synchro. Synchros also require careful handling. Never 
force a synchro into place, never use pliers on the threaded shaft, and never force a gear or dial onto the 
shaft. Finally, never connect equipment that is not related to the synchro system to the primary excitation 
bus. This will cause the system to show all the symptoms of a shorted rotor when the equipment is turned 
on; but, the system will check out good when the equipment is off.
