The average number of earthquakes between 1978 and 1999 was 1.6 earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or higher per year. This average dropped even lower between 2000 and 2008, with no year ever having more than three earthquakes of greater than or equal to magnitude 3.0 during the period. However, totals well above the 1978â€“2008 averages were recorded in 2009, with 20 earthquakes with magnitudes of at least 3.0 recorded. By the end of the year, Oklahoma County had seen its most active earthquake year since 1889, as recorded by the Oklahoma Geological Survey.
Earthquakes continued in 2010, with numerous earthquakes occurring in Central Oklahoma; among these is an earthquake which took place on October 13 in the vicinity of Norman. With a USGS-assigned magnitude of 4.4 Mw, it resulted in two fall-related injuries, and the USGS received felt reports from seven states. The year ended with an annual statewide total of 43 earthquakes of magnitude 3.0 or greater.
