This expression represents the actual time propagation of the
real system and the estimate. Since the estimate is calculated
exactly,2 no process driving noise is represented in the corres-
ponding rows of equation 4.33. In addition, the zeros concat-
enated into the estimation gain vector account for the fact that
the estimator corrections do not affect the state of the actual
system. For this coupled system, the covariance propagates
between sampling times according to:
