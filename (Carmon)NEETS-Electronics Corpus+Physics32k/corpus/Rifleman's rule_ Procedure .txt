In general, the shooter will have a table of bullet heights with respect to the LOS versus horizontal distance. Historically, this table has been referred to as a "drop table." The drop table can be generated empirically using data taken by the shooter at a rifle range; calculated using a ballistic simulator; or is provided by the rifle/cartridge manufacturer. The drop values are measured or calculated assuming the rifle has been zeroed at a specific range. The bullet will have a drop value of zero at the zero range. Table 1 gives a typical example of a drop table for a rifle zeroed at 100 meters.
Table 1: Example Bullet Drop Table
If the shooter is engaging a target on an incline and has a properly zeroed rifle, the shooter goes through the following procedure:
Determine the slant range to the target (measurement can be performed using various forms of range finders, e.g. laser rangefinder)
Determine the elevation angle of the target (measurement can be made using various devices, e.g. sight attached unit)
Apply the "rifleman's rule" to determine the equivalent horizontal range (

Use the bullet drop table to determine the bullet drop over that equivalent horizontal range (interpolation is likely to be required)
Compute the bore angle correction that is to be applied to the sight. The correction is computed using the equation
