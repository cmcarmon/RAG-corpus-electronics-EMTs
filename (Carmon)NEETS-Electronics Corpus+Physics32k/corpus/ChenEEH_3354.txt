becomes negative. That is, the speed v starts to decrease from
the value v1 as the time increases from t ¼ t1. Only after the
speed v has decreased below the synchronous speed vs can the
rotor angle start to decrease. Until then, the rotor angle will
keep increasing, and the rotor speed keeps decreasing as time
increases from t ¼ t1.
