The classical free particle is characterized simply by a fixed velocity v. The momentum is given by





p

=
m

v



{\displaystyle \mathbf {p} =m\mathbf {v} }

and the kinetic energy (equal to total energy) by




E
=


1
2


m

v

2




{\displaystyle E={\frac {1}{2}}mv^{2}}

where m is the mass of the particle and v is the vector velocity of the particle.
