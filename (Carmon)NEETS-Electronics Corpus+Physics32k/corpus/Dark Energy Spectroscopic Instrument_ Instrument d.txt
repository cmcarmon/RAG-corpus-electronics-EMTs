The DESI instrument will implement a new highly multiplexed optical spectrograph on the Mayall Telescope. A new optical corrector design creates a very large, 8.0 square degree field of view on the sky, which combined with the new focal plane instrumentation will weigh approximately 20,000 lbs. The focal plane accommodates 5,000 small computer controlled fiber positioners on a 10.4 millimeter pitch. The entire focal plane can be reconfigured for the next exposure in less than two minutes while the telescope slews to the next field.
The instrument fabrication is managed by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Construction on the new instrument started in 2015. Funding is provided by the Department of Energy Office of Science, the National Science Foundation, the Science and Technology Facilities Council of the U.K., by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, by the Heising-Simons Foundation, and by collaborating institutions worldwide.
