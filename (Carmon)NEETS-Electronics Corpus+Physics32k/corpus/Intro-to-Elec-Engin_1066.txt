*12.2.14 A four-pole, dc series motor has a lap-connected,
two-layer armature winding with a total of 400
conductors. Calculate the gross torque developed
for a ï¬‚ux per pole of 0.02 Wb and an armature
current of 50 A. (Note: The number of parallel
paths is equal to the number of poles for lap
windings.)
