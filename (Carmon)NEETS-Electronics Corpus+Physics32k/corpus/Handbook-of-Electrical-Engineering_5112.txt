Second-order  anisotropic  reciprocal  magnetooptic  effect  which  causes  a  linearly
polarized  incident  light  to  transmit  through  as  an  elliptically  polarized  output  light  wave  when  the
propagation direction of the incident light is perpendicular to the direction of the applied magnetization
of the magnetooptic medium. It is also known as magnetic linear birefringence (MLB).
