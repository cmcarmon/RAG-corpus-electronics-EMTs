To  reduce  high  inrush  currents  in  starting  large  motors,  a  capacitor  starting  system  is  employed.  This
maintains acceptable voltage levels throughout the system. The high inductive component of normal reactive
starting current is offset by the addition, during the starting period only, of capacitors to the motor bus. This
differs from applying capacitors for motor power factor correction.
