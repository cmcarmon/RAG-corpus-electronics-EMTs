In selecting electrostrictive relaxor ferroelectrics for actuator and sensor applications, the following criteria
are commonly used. A large dielectric constant and ﬁeld stability in the K vs. E relations are useful in achieving
large electrostrictive strains. These criteria also lead to large induced polarizations and large induced piezoelec-
tric coefﬁcients through the second converse effect.
