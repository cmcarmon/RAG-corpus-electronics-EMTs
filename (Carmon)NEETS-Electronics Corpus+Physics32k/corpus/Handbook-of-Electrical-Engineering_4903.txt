In addition to the texts and review article cited in the references, an older but still valid article by J. P. Jan, in
Solid  State  Physics  (edited  by  F.  Seitz  and  D.  Turnbull,  New York: Academic  Press,  1957,  p.  1)  can  provide  a
background in the various thermomagnetic and galvanomagnetic properties in metals. A parallel background
for semiconductors can be found in the monograph by E. H. Putley, The Hall Effect and Related Phenomena
(Boston: Butterworths, 1960).
