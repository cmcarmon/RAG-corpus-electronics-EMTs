When the Lie group



G


{\displaystyle G}
splits as a product



G
=

G

G

{\displaystyle G=G_{1}\times G_{2}}
there is an obvious construction of lattices in



G


{\displaystyle G}
from the smaller groups: if




Γ

⊂

G

,

Γ

G

{\displaystyle \Gamma _{1}\subset G_{1},\Gamma _{2}\subset G_{2}}
are lattices then




Γ

⊂
G


{\displaystyle \Gamma _{1}\times \Gamma _{2}\subset G}
is a lattice as well. Roughly, a lattice is then said to be irreducible if it does not come from this construction.
More formally, if

{\displaystyle G=G_{1}\times \ldots \times G_{r}}
is the decomposition of

{\displaystyle \Gamma \subset G}
is said to be irreducible if either of the following equivalent conditions hold:
