(transverse) to the direction of propagation, which is along the axial line. That is to say, no
electromagnetic ﬁeld component exists in the axial direction. In the case of single-conductor
hollow (pipelike) waveguides, either the TE (transverse electric) or the TM (transverse magnetic)
mode can be energized. In the TE conﬁguration, the electric ﬁeld is transverse to the direction of
propagation (which is along the axial line of the waveguide); that is to say, no electric ﬁeld exists
in the direction of propagation, while an axial component of the magnetic ﬁeld is present. On the
other hand, in the TM conﬁguration, the magnetic ﬁeld is transverse to the direction of propagation:
i.e., no magnetic ﬁeld exists in the axial direction, whereas an axial component of the electric
ﬁeld is present. Within either grouping, a number of conﬁgurations or modes can exist, either
separately or simultaneously. However, we are generally concerned with the so-called dominant
mode, which is deﬁned as the lowest frequency mode that can exist in the waveguide. When
operating at a frequency above fc, known as the cutoff frequency, a wave propagates down the
waveguide and the mode is called propagation mode. When operating below the cutoff frequency,
the ﬁeld decays exponentially and there is no wave propagation.
