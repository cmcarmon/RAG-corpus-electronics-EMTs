It should not be difficult to conclude, from what you already know, that semiconductor devices can
and do perform all the conventional functions of rectification, amplification, oscillation, timing,
switching, and sensing. Simply stated, these devices perform the same basic functions as the electron
tube; but they perform more efficiently, economically, and for a longer period of time. Therefore, it
should be no surprise to you to see these devices used in place of electron tubes. Keeping this in mind, we
see that it is only natural and logical to compare semiconductor devices with electron tubes.
