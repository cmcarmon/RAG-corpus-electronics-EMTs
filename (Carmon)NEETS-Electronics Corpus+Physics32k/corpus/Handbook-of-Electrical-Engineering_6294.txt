Harmonic ﬁlters are employed to attenuate out-of-band radiation of the aural and visual signals to ensure
compliance with FCC requirements. Filter designs vary depending upon the manufacturer; however, most are
of coaxial construction utilizing L and C components housed within a prepackaged assembly. Stub ﬁlters are
also used, typically adjusted to provide maximum attenuation at the second harmonic of the operating frequency
of the visual carrier and the aural carrier.
