Speech features are often vector-valued. An example would
be (estimates of) the set of ﬁlter coefﬁcients {ai} associated with
the DT model of speech in equation 3.6. As we detail in Section
3.3.2, these coefﬁcient estimates, typically 14 in number, are the
result of ‘‘linear prediction’’ analysis of speech. Such a set of
features is called a parametric representation of the frame
because it consists of values for the parameters associated with
a predetermined model. In the present example, the set of 14
model parameters might be complemented by an estimate of
the system gain (H0 in equation 3.6) and a binary valued feature
to indicate a voiced or unvoiced frame. Each frame, therefore,
would be represented by a real vector of dimension 16.
