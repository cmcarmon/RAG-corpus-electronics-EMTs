The ionosphere extends upward from about 31.1 miles (50 km) to a height of about 250 miles (402 
km). It contains four cloud-like layers of electrically charged ions, which enable radio waves to be 
propagated to great distances around the Earth. This is the most important region of the atmosphere for 
long distance point-to-point communications. This region will be discussed in detail a little later in this 
chapter.
