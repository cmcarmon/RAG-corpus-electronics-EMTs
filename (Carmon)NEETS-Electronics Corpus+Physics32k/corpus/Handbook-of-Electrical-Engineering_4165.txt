The  so-called  wavetilt  formula,  given  in  Eq.  (40.7),  models  the  ratio,  in  the  frequency  domain,  of  the
horizontal to vertical electric Ô¨Åeld of a plane wave at the surface of an earth of conductivity s and permittivity

0 for the case of grazing incidence and is certainly applicable to lightning return strokes occurring beyond
