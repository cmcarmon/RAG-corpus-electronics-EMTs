Array Signal Processing: Concepts and Techniques, by D. H. Johnson and D. E. Dudgeon, incorporates results
from discrete-time signal processing into array processing applications such as signal detection, estimation of
direction of propagation, and frequency content of signals (Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1993).
