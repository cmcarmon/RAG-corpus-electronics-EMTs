Notice that each parameter can be measured by setting a port current, I1 or I2, equal to zero. Since the parameters
are found by setting these currents equal to zero, this set of parameters is called open-circuit parameters. Also,
since  the  deÔ¨Ånitions  of  the  parameters  as  shown  in  Eqs. (3.53)  are  the  ratio  of  voltages  to  currents,  we
alternatively  refer  to  them  as  impedance  parameters,  or  z  parameters.  The  parameters  themselves  can  be
impedances  represented  as  Laplace  transforms,  Z(s),  sinusoidal  steady-state  impedance  functions,  Z(jw),  or
simply pure resistance values, R.
