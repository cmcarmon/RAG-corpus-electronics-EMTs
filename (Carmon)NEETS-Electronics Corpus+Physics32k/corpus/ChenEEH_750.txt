The Ô¨Årst step in custom memory organization design is to
make sure the real-time constraints are met at minimal cost.
All the memory accesses in the application have to be made
within the given real-time constraint. A certain amount of
memory bandwidth is needed to meet this constraint. The
goal of the SCBD step is to order the memory accesses in the
available time such that the resulting memory bandwidth is as
cheap as possible.
