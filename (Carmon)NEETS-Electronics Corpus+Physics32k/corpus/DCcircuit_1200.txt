This formula relates the resistance of a conductor with its speciﬁc resistance (the Greek
letter ”rho” (ρ), which looks similar to a lower-case letter ”p”), its length (”l”), and its cross-
sectional area (”A”). Notice that with the length variable on the top of the fraction, the re-
sistance value increases as the length increases (analogy: it is more difﬁcult to force liquid
through a long pipe than a short one), and decreases as cross-sectional area increases (anal-
ogy: liquid ﬂows easier through a fat pipe than through a skinny one). Speciﬁc resistance is a
constant for the type of conductor material being calculated.
