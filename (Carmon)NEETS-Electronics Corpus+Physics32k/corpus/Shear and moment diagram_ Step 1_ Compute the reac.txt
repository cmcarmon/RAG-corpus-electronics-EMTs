The first step obtaining the bending moment and shear force equations is to determine the reaction forces. This is done using a free body diagram of the entire beam.
The beam has three reaction forces, Ra, Rb at the two supports and Rc at the clamped end. The clamped end also has a reaction couple Mc. These four quantities have to be determined using two equations, the balance of forces in the beam and the balance of moments in the beam. Four unknowns cannot be found given two independent equations in these unknown variables and hence the beam is statically indeterminate. One way of solving this problem is to use the principle of linear superposition and break the problem up into the superposition of a number of statically determinate problems. The extra boundary conditions at the supports have to be incorporated into the superposed solution so that the deformation of the entire beam is compatible.
From the free-body diagram of the entire beam we have the two balance equations

Summing the forces, we have

{\displaystyle -10-(1)(15)+R_{a}+R_{b}+R_{c}=0}

and summing the moments around the free end (A) we have

{\displaystyle (R_{a})(10)+(R_{b})(25)+(R_{c})(50)-(1)(15)(17.5)-50+M_{c}=0\,.}

We can solve these equations for Rb and Rc in terms of Ra and Mc :

{\displaystyle R_{c}=-12.5+0.6R_{a}-0.04M_{c}\,.}

If we sum moments about the first support from the left of the beam we have

{\displaystyle (10)(10)-(1)(15)(7.5)+(R_{b})(15)+(R_{c})(40)-50+M_{c}=0\,.}

If we plug in the expressions for Rb and Rc we get the trivial identity 0 = 0 which indicates that this equation is not independent of the previous two. Similarly, if we take moments around the second support, we have

(
25

.


{\displaystyle (10)(25)-(R_{a})(15)+(1)(15)(7.5)+(R_{c})(25)-50+M_{c}=0\,.}

Once again we find that this equation is not independent of the first two equations. We could also try to compute moments around the clamped end of the beam to get

(
50

.


{\displaystyle (10)(50)-(R_{a})(40)-(R_{b})(25)+(1)(15)(32.5)-50+M_{c}=0\,.}

This equation also turns out not to be linearly independent from the other two equations. Therefore, the beam is statically indeterminate and we will have to find the bending moments in segments of the beam as functions of Ra and Mc.
