straightforward. It will first be necessary to ensure 
that  an  adequate  number  of  ways  are  catered  for 
and  that  the  connector  is  suitably  rated  as  far  as 
current  and  voltage  are  concerned  (one  should 
consult  individual  manufacturerâ€™s  ratings  where 
any  doubt  arises).  It  is  advisable  to  maintain 
compatibility  with  equipment  of  similar  type  and 
one  should  avoid  using  too  wide  a  range  of 
connectors and cables. In addition, a common pin-
usage  convention  should  be  adopted  and  strictly 
adhered  to. This  will  help  to  avoid  problems  later 
on  and  will  make  interwiring  of  equipment  and 
exchange  of  modules  a  relatively  straightforward 
process.
