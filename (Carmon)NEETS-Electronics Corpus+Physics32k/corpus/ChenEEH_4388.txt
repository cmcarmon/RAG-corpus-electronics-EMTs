where u‘, w‘ 2 Cn are right and left eigenvectors of A, respect-
ively, and H denotes complex-conjugate transpose. The effect of
the ‘th pole on the ith output is determined by the 1  n residue
matrix Ciu‘w H
‘ B and the product of this residue times the vector
of inputs u(s). If each entry in the residue matrix is small, then
this pole will have little effect on yi(t ). It is also possible for some
entries of the residue matrix not to be small but the product of a
residue with the vector of inputs to still be small. This indicates
that for some directions of the input vector, a pole may have a
more signiﬁcant effect than in other directions. The concept of
input directions is unique to MIMO systems, and it will be
discussed again in the next subsection.
