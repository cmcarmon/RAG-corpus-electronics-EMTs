From the preceding discussion it might appear that capacitors and inductors
appear only as parasitics in circuits, causing undesirable delays. This is far from
the truth. While they can and do act in that role, they are also often purposefully
introduced into circuits, both as discrete devices on breadboards and printed-
circuit boards, and as integrated-circuit components on a chip (see Figures 9.9
and 9.10 for examples of capacitors and inductors, respectively). For example,
they are the cornerstones of memories, filters, samplers, and energy processing
circuits. We shall see many examples of these in future chapters as well. Thus,
we have many reasons to study capacitors and inductors.
