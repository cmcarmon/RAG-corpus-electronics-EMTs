The study of velocity gradients is useful in analysing path dependent materials and in the subsequent study of stresses and strains, e.g. Plastic deformation of metals. The near-wall velocity gradient of the unburned reactants flowing from a tube is a key parameter for characterising flame stability. The velocity gradient of a plasma can define conditions for the solutions to fundamental equations in magnetohydrodynamics.
