FIGURE 80.12  Host-to-device pathways. For large IBM mainframes, the connection between host and device must pass
through a channel, storage director, and string controller. Note that multiple storage directors can be attached to a channel,
multiple string controllers per storage director, and multiple devices per string controller. This multipathing approach makes
it  possible  to  share  devices  among  hosts  and  to  provide  alternative  pathways  to  better  utilize  the  drives  and  controllers.
While logically correct, the ﬁgure does not reﬂect the true physical components of high-end IBM systems (308X, 3090). The
concept of channel has disappeared from these systems and has been replaced by a channel path.
