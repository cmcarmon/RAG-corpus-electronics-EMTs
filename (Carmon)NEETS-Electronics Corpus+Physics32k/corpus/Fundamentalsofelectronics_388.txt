More than just decaying slowly, Fourier series approximation shown in Figure 4.8 exhibits interesting behav-
ior. Although the square waveâ€™s Fourier series requires more terms for a given representation accuracy, when
comparing plots it is not clear that the two are equal. Does the Fourier series really equal the square wave
at all values of t? In particular, at each step-change in the square wave, the Fourier series exhibits a peak
followed by rapid oscillations. As more terms are added to the series, the oscillations seem to become more
rapid and smaller, but the peaks are not decreasing. For the Fourier series approximation for the half-wave
