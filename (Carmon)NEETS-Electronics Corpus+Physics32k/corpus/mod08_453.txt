In the circuit shown in figure 3-40, the bias circuit is adjusted to set the saturable-core reactor at the
ideal operating point. Input signals, represented by the a.c. source symbol, are applied to the control input.
The true power of the load circuit is controlled by the control input signal (a.c.)
