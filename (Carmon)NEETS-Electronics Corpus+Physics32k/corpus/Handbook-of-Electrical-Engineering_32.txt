Figure 1.8 shows the variation in current noise versus voltage frequency. Current noise varies inversely with
frequency  and  is  a  function  of  the  current  ï¬‚owing  through  the  resistor  and  the  value  of  the  resistor.  The
magnitude of current noise is directly proportional to the square root of current. The current noise magnitude
is usually expressed by a noise index given as the ratio of the root-mean-square current noise voltage (ERMS)
