Due to the orientation of the Earth with respect to the rest of the Galaxy, the 2nd galactic quadrant is primarily only visible from the northern hemisphere while the 4th galactic quadrant is mostly only visible from the southern hemisphere. Thus, it is usually more practical for amateur stargazers to use the celestial quadrants. Nonetheless, cooperating or international astronomical organizations are not so bound by the Earth's horizon.
Based on a view from Earth, one may look towards major constellations for a rough sense of where the borders of the quadrants are: (Note: by drawing a line through the following, one can also approximate the galactic equator.)
For 0째, look towards the Sagittarius constellation. (The galactic center)
For 90째, look towards the Cygnus constellation.
For 180째, look towards the Auriga constellation. (The galactic anticenter)
For 270째, look towards the Vela constellation.
