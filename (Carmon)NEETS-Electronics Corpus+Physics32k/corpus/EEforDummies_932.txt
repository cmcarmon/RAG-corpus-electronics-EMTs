Let’s say your hands are dry and you aren’t wearing a metal ring or standing 
in a puddle, and your hand‐to‐hand resistance is about 50,000 ohms. (Keep 
in mind that your resistance under these dry, ringless conditions may actu-
ally be lower.) You can calculate an estimate (repeat: estimate) of the voltage 
levels that might hurt you by multiplying your resistance by the different 
current levels in Table 13-1. For instance, if you don’t want to feel even the 
slightest tingling sensation in your fingers, you need to avoid coming into 
contact with wires carrying DC voltages of 30 V (that’s 0 6
  ). 
.
To avoid involuntary muscle contractions (grabbing the wires), you need to 
keep AC current below 10 mA, so avoid close proximity to 500 volts AC (VAC) 
or more.
