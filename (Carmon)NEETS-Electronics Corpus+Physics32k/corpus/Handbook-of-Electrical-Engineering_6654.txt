LAN architectures, on the other hand, anticipate all nodes being interconnected in some fashion over the
same communication link (or medium). This, then, introduces the concept of adaption layers in a natural way.
It also illustrates that if the services provided by an architectural layer are carefully deﬁned, then the services
can be used to implement virtually any service desired by the user, possibly at the price of some inefﬁciency.
After discussing LANs, we will conclude our article with a discussion of two of the variants in packet switching
asyn-
transmission technology: frame relay and a recent development in basic transmission technology called the 
chronous transfer mode
 effort. These
technologies are likely to be important building blocks for the computer communication networks of the future.
