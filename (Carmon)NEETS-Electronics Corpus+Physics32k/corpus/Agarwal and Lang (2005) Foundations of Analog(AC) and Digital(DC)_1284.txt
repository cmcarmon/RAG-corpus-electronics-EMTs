Let us now return to Figure 9.4, and develop a model for the capacitance and
inductance of the conductors inside an integrated circuit (IC) that are implied
by the figure. Many conductors inside integrated circuits can be modeled as
a flat conductor above a conducting substrate, or ground plane, as shown in
Figure 9.27.
