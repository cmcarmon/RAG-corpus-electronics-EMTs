Decomposed granite is rock of granitic origin that has weathered to the point that it readily fractures into smaller pieces of weak rock. Further weathering produces rock that easily crumbles into mixtures of gravel-sized particles, sand, and silt-sized particles with some clay. Eventually, the gravel may break down to produce a mixture of silica sand, silt particles, and clay. Different specific granite types have differing propensities to weather, and so differing likelihoods of producing decomposed granite.
The parent granite material is a common type of igneous rock that is granular, with its grains large enough to be distinguished with the unaided eye (i.e., it is phaneritic in texture); it is composed of plagioclase feldspar, orthoclase feldspar, quartz, mica, and possibly other minerals. The chemical transformation of feldspar, one of the primary constituents of granite, into the clay mineral kaolin is one of the important weathering processes. The presence of clay allows water to seep in and further weaken the rock allowing it to fracture or crumble into smaller particles, where, ultimately, the grains of silica produced from the granite are relatively resistant to weathering, and may remain almost unaltered.
