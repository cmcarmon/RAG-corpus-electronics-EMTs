Due to the rapidly increasing capability of computers, compu-
tational electromagnetics has become a very important analysis
tool in electromagnetics. This is partly due to the predictive
power of Maxwell’s theory as proven over the years—Max-
well’s theory can predict the design performances or experi-
mental outcomes if Maxwell’s equations are solved correctly.
Moreover, Maxwell’s theory, which governs the basic principles
behind the manipulation of electricity, is also extremely per-
tinent in many electrical engineering and scientiﬁc technolo-
gies. Examples of these technologies are radar, remote sensing,
geoelectromagnetics, bioelectromagnetics, antennas, wireless
communication, optics, and high-frequency circuits. Further-
more, Maxwell’s theory is valid over a broad range of frequen-
cies spanning static to optics and over a large dynamic range of
length scales, from subatomic to intergalactic. In view of this,
there is always a quest to solve Maxwell’s equations accurately
from ﬁrst principles using numerical methods so that increas-
ingly complex structures can be handled.
