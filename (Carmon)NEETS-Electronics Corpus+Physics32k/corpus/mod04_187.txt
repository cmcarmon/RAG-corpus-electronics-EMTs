There are two classes of flux: corrosive and noncorrosive. Zinc chloride, hydrochloric acid, and sal 
ammoniac are corrosive fluxes. Corrosive flux should NEVER be used in electrical or electronic repair 
work. Use only rosin fluxes. Any flux remaining in the joint corrodes the connection and creates a 
defective circuit. Rosin is a noncorrosive flux and is available in paste, liquid, or powder form.
