In circuits using cathode bias, the cathode is made to go positive relative to the grid. The effect of
this is the same as making the grid negative relative to the cathode. Because the biasing resistor is in the
cathode leg of the circuit, the method is called CATHODE BIASING or CATHODE BIAS. A triode
circuit using cathode bias is shown in figure 1-22.
