Because the sinusoid is a superposition of two complex exponentials, the sinusoid is more complex. We could
not prevent ourselves from the pun in this statement. Clearly, the word “complex” is used in two diﬀerent
ways here. The complex exponential can also be written (using Euler’s relation (2.16)) as a sum of a sine and
a cosine. We will discover that virtually every signal can be decomposed into a sum of complex exponentials,
and that this decomposition is very useful. Thus, the complex exponential is more fundamental, and Euler’s
relation does not adequately reveal its complexity.
2.4 Discrete-Time Signals7
So far, we have treated what are known as analog signals and systems. Mathematically, analog signals are
functions having continuous quantities as their independent variables, such as space and time. Discrete-time
signals are functions deﬁned on the integers; they are sequences. One of the fundamental results of signal
theory details the conditions under which an analog signal can be converted into a discrete-time one and
retrieved without error. This result is important because discrete-time signals can be manipulated by
