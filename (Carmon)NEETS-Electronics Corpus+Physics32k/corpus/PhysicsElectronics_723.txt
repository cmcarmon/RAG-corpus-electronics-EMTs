Electronic circuits which combine digital signals according to the Boolean algebra are referred
to as logic gates; gates because they control the ï¬‚ow of information. Positive logic is an
electronic representation in which the true state is at a higher voltage, while negative logic
has the true state at a lower voltage. We will use the positive logic type in this course.
