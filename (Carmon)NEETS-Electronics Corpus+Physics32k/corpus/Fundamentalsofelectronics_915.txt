Figure 6.23: The probability of an error occurring in transmitted K = 4 data bits equals 1 − (1 − pe)4
as (1 − pe)4 equals the probability that the four bits are received without error. The upper curve displays
how this probability of an error anywhere in the four-bit block varies with the signal-to-noise ratio. When
a (7,4) single-bit error correcting code is used, the transmitter reduced the energy it expends during a
single-bit transmission by 4/7, appending three extra bits for error correction. Now the probability of
any bit in the seven-bit block being in error after error correction equals 1 − (1 − p(cid:48)
e)6,
where p(cid:48)
e is the probability of a bit error occurring in the channel when channel coding occurs. Here
(7p(cid:48)
e)6 equals the probability of exactly on in seven bits emerging from the channel in error; The
channel decoder corrects this type of error, and all data bits in the block are received correctly.
