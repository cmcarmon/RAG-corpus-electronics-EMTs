For the Airbus A380 TTTech developed the internal communication system for the cabin pressure control system, working together with Nord-Micro, a subsidiary of Hamilton Sundstrand Corporation.
In cooperation with Hamilton Sundstrand Corporation, TTTech developed a TTP-based data communication platform for the electric and environmental control system of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. The TTP-designed communication platform prevents an overload in the bus system, even if several important events occur simultaneously. Additionally, TTP-based systems weigh less than conventional systems due to a lower connecter count and less wiring. Furthermore, the whole system is more flexible and has a greater modularity than conventional communication systems.
