temperature. In other words, across the glass-transition temperature, the material can change from a glass to
rubbery state, allowing signiﬁcant deformation in response to temperature changes. Shape-memory polymers,
in general, are durable, lightweight, and transparent. Nippon Zeon Company and Mitsubishi Company have
developed  high-performance  SMPs  in  the  recent  past  [Chong  et al.,  1990]. While  the  SMP  of  Nippon  Zeon
Company is polynorborene based, Mitsubishi’s SMP is polyurethane based, which overcomes crucial weaknesses
such as poor processability and limited-temperature operating range. In their applications SMPs can be used
either as an elastic memory material or a shape-memory material. Depending on which of these possibilities
are used, the range of applications differs.
