To use an applications program, it must be compatible with the operating system. Therefore, the 
availability of application software for a particular operating system is critical. Because of this, several 
operating systems have become the most popular. For 8-bit microcomputers, CP/M (Control Program for 
Microprocessors) is widely used because many hardware manufacturers have adopted it. MS-DOS 
(MicroSoft Disk Operating System) designed from CP/M dominates in lower performance 16-bit systems. 
UNIX, an operating system for larger computers, is being used on the more powerful 16-bit and 32-bit 
microcomputers. Other operating systems are offered by microcomputer manufacturers.
