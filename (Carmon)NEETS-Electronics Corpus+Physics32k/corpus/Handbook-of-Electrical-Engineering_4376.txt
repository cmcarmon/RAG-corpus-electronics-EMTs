The invention of the laser in 1960 gave a new impetus to the idea of lightwave communications (as scientists
realized the potential of the dazzling information-carrying capacity of these lasers). Much research was under-
taken by different laboratories around the world during the early 1960s on optical devices and transmission
media. The transmission media, however, remained the main problem, until K.C. Kao and G.A. Hockham in
1966  proposed  that  glass  ﬁbers  with  a  sufﬁciently  high-purity  core  surrounded  by  a  lower  refractive  index
cladding could be used for transmitting light over long distances. At the time, available glasses had losses of
several thousand decibels per kilometer. In 1970, Robert Maurer of Corning Glass Works was able to produce
a  ﬁber  with  a  loss  of  20  dB/km.  Tremendous  progress  in  the  production  of  low-loss  optical  ﬁbers  has  been
made  since  then  in  the  various  laboratories  in  the  United  States,  Japan,  and  Europe,  and  today  optical  ﬁber
communication is one of the fastest growing industries. Optical ﬁber communication is being used to transmit
voice, video, and data over long distance as well as within a local network.
