Desktop publishing software allows for combining 
text and images on a page, manipulation of the page 
elements, creative layouts, and multipage documents. 
High-end or professional-level desktop publishing pro-
grams include more prepress features, whereas software 
for home or small business use have more templates and 
clip art. Prepress refers to the process of preparing the 
digital files for the printing press. Templates are used in 
publishing to automatically copy or link elements and 
graphic design styles to some or all the pages of a mul-
tipage document. Linked elements can be modified in 
all locations or pages without having to change each ele-
ment on each page in a number of pages that have the 
same element. Master pages are templates that are used 
to apply a graphic design style to all the pages in a docu-
ment and add automatic page numbering if required.
