The axle in a DC motor rotates a few thousand times per minute â€” a bit fast 
for most applications. Suppliers sell DC motors with something called a gear 
head premounted; this device reduces the speed of the output shaft to under 
a hundred revolutions per minute (rpm). This technique is similar to the way 
that changing gears in your car changes the speed of the car.
