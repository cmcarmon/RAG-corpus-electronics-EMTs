To complete the node analysis, we complete Steps 4 and 5 by solving
Equation 12.40 for v1, and using it to determine v2 and other branch variables
of interest. Equation 12.40 is an ordinary second-order homogeneous linear
differential equation with constant coefficients. Since the circuit does not have
a drive, its homogeneous solution is also its total solution. Thus, as with Equa-
tion 12.4, we expect its solution also to be a superposition of two terms of the
form
