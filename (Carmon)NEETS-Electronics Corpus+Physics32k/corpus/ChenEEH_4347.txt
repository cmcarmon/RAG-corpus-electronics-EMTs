Additional details on eigenvectors and linear transform-
ations in general can be found in Schrader and Sain (2000).
Canonical forms such as the companion, controllable, and
modal or observable forms are commonly used for control
purposes. The key is in always remembering, through the
appropriate linear transformation, how a canonical form is
related to the original matrix. This is much like dropping
breadcrumbs behind you as you move from one place to
another so that you can always Ô¨Ånd your way home.
