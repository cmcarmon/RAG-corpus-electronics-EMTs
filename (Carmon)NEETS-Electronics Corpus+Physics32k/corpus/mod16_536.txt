Inductance is measured in terms of a two-element equivalent circuit consisting of an inductance
either in series or in parallel with a resistance. The internal ac generator and detector of the model 250DE
bridge are tuned to 1 kHz. Other frequencies can be used, but like capacitance measurements, an external
