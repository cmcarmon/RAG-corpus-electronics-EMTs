In fluid statics, capillary pressure (





p

c





{\displaystyle {p_{c}}}
) is the pressure between two immiscible fluids in a thin tube (see capillary), resulting from the interactions of forces between the fluids and solid walls of the tube. Capillary pressure can serve as both an opposing or driving force for fluid transport and is a significant property for research and industrial purposes (namely microfluidic design and oil extraction from porous rock). It is also observed in natural phenomena.
