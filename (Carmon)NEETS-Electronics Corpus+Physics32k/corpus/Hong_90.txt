The MOSFET device has four-terminals including gate, source, drain, and body 
as shown in Figure 7.6. The gate is a metal electrode that is insulated from the other three 
terminals via a thin oxide layer. In an N-channel MOSFET, the source and drain are N-
type and the body is P-type. Conversely, for a P-channel MOSFET, the source and drain 
are P-type and the body is N-type. The N-channel device will be used as an example to 
explain the basic principles of the MOSFET.
