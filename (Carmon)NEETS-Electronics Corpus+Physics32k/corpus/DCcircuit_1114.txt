For secondary cells, the amp-hour rating provides a rule for necessary charging time at any
given level of charge current. For example, the 70 amp-hour automotive battery in the previous
example should take 10 hours to charge from a fully-discharged state at a constant charging
current of 7 amps (70 amp-hours / 7 amps).
