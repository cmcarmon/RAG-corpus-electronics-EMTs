Diodes used this way — to convert AC current into varying DC current (it’s 
DC because the current is flowing in one direction only, but it isn’t a constant 
current) — are called rectifier diodes, or just rectifiers. Rectifier diodes are 
designed to handle currents ranging from several hundred milliamps to a 
few amps — much higher strengths than general‐purpose signal diodes are 
designed to handle (those currents go up to only about 100 mA). You’ll see 
rectifiers used in two major ways:
