The fish approach the water surface at high speed (about 10 m/s in large fish; 20-30 body lengths/s) with their lateral fins furled against the body. They get accelerated by beating their tails rapidly, and break through the water surface at a shallow angle to the horizontal. Four fish in ray-finned fish family(Beloniformes) and salmon have this jumping behavior. The ray-finned fish includes needlefish, flyingfish, halfbeak, and sauries. Salmon jump out waterfalls during upstream spawning migrations.
