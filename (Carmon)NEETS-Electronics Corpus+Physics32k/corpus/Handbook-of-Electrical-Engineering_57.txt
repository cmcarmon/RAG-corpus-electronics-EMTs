Thermistors. Thermistors are resistors that change their resistance exponentially with changes in temperature.
If the resistance decreases with increase in temperature, the resistor is called a negative temperature coefﬁcient
(NTC) resistor. If the resistance increases with temperature, the resistor is called a positive temperature coef-
ﬁcient (PTC) resistor.
