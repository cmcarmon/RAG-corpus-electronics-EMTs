where P has units of joules per second [J/s] or watts [W]. This
power is dissipated as heat in the conductive material through
an irreversible process since P is unchanged when the direction
of E in equation 1.16 is reversed with J given in equation 1.8.
Considering a conductor with a uniform cross section and
a length L, if both E and J are directed along the conductorâ€™s
length at all points, then from equation 1.16:
