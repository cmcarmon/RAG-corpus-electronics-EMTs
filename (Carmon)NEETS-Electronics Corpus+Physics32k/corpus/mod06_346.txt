Such gas-filled triodes are known as THYRATRONS. Thyratrons are used in circuits where current
flow in the thyratrons output circuit is possible only when a certain amount of voltage is present on the
thyratrons grid. The flow of plate current persists even after the initiating grid voltage is no longer present
at the grid, and it can be stopped only by removing or lowering the plate potential. The symbols for the
gas-filled diode, the voltage regulator, and the thyratron are the same as those for high-vacuum tubes
except that a dot is placed within the envelope circle to signify the presence of gas. Some examples of
gas-filled tube schematic symbols are shown in figure 2-15.
