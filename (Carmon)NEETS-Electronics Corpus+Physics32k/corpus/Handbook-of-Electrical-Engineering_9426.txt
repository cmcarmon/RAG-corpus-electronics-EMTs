approach. Hybrid techniques combine the attractive
features of both the passive and active approaches. Fault masking is used in hybrid systems to prevent erroneous
results  from  being  generated.  Fault  detection,  fault  location,  and  fault  recovery  are  also  used  in  the  hybrid
approaches  to  improve  fault  tolerance  by  removing  faulty  hardware  and  replacing  it  with  spares.  Providing
spares is one form of providing redundancy in a system. Hybrid methods are most often used in the critical-
computation applications where fault masking is required to prevent momentary errors, and high reliability
must be achieved. The basic concept of the hybrid approach is illustrated in Fig. 93.3.
