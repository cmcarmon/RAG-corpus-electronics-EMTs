it switches to its unstable state. The length of time 
the circuit is in the unstable state is determined by 
the RC time constant of resistor R3 and capacitor C1. 
Capacitor C2 and resistor R4 form a differentiator 
circuit, which is used to convert the input pulse to a 
positive spike and a negative spike. Diode D1 allows 
only the negative spike to pass through to turn on the 
circuit.
