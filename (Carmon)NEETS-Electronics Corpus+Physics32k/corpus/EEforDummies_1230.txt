You can adjust the sensitivity of the alarm by turning the pot (R1), which 
simply alters the voltage divider ratio, so more (or less) light is needed 
to turn transistor Q1 on. Decide for yourself whether you want to sense a 
change from total darkness to low light or from low light to bright light.
