The  dynamic  voltage  restorer  is  similar  to  the  statcon,  with  a  trans-
former, converter, and storage, except that the transformer is connected
in series with the busbar feeding the sensitive load. Compensation occurs in both directions, making up for
the voltage dips and reducing the overvoltage. The response is very fast, occurring within a few milliseconds.
The capacity of the dc storage capacitor, in both the statcon and the dynamic voltage restorer, determines
the duration of the correction provided for individual voltage dips. It can be a few cycles or seconds long. To
enhance  the  load  support  capability,  a  storage  battery  with  a  booster  electronic  circuit  can  be  connected  in
parallel with the capacitor.
