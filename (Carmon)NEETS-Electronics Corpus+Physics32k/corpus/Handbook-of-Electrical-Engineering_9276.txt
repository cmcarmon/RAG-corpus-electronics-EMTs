Note that the use of Function Points rather than the traditional KLOC metric is preferred for both defect
potential and for defect origin analysis. KLOC metrics produce invalid and paradoxical results when applied
to  requirements,  speciÔ¨Åcation,  and  documentation  error  classes.  Since  defects  outside  the  code  itself  often
constitute more than 50% of the total bugs discovered, KLOC metrics are harmful to the long-range under-
standing of software quality.
