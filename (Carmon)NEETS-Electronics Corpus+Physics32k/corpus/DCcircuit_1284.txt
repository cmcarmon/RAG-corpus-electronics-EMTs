Polarity: Some capacitors are manufactured so they can only tolerate applied voltage in one
polarity but not the other. This is due to their construction: the dielectric is a microscopically
thin layer of insulation deposited on one of the plates by a DC voltage during manufacture.
These are called electrolytic capacitors, and their polarity is clearly marked.
