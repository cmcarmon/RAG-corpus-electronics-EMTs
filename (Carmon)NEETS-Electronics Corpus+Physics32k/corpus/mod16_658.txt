When adjusting a pattern onto the screen, adjust the INTEN (intensity) and FOCUS controls for a
bright, sharp line. If other control settings are such that a dot instead of a line appears, turn down the
intensity to prevent burning a hole in the screen coating. Because of the different speeds at which the
beam travels across the screen, brightness and sharpness will vary at various frequency settings. For this
reason, you may have to adjust the INTEN and FOCUS controls occasionally while taking readings.
