Summary and Conclusion
Although eddy-current stimulation of excitable tissue is quite popular now, the ﬁrst report was by d’Arsonval
[1896], who reported seeing bright ﬂashes in the visual ﬁeld (phosphenes) when the head was placed in a coil
carrying 30 amperes of 42 Hz current (see Geddes translation [1991]). It is now known that stimulation of the
retinal receptors in the eye produces such phosphenes.
