Based on the above principle, a coaxial calorimeter of good sensitivity with a short, 50-ohm resistive 
film on a lava (dielectric) center conductor, enclosed within a tapered, thin-walled outer conductor, is 
used for frequencies between 0 and 1.2 GHz. The rf termination is electrically connected to, but thermally 
isolated from, a massive mounting plate by a short section of silvered-lava coaxial line with a high 
thermal resistance. The steady-state temperature rise of the outer casing of the load with respect to the 
mounting plate is measured by a differential platinum-resistance thermometer in a Wheatstone bridge. 
Low-frequency power applied to the termination provides a method of calibration. Power in the range of 
0 to 2.5 watts may be measured. A 70-second time constant and steady-state temperatures are attained in 
about 6 minutes. The small physical size of termination (to keep convective and radiative heat losses low) 
provides high sensitivity. Calibration with lower frequency power is extremely accurate, because the 
termination is broadband and should exhibit the same power distribution from dc to 10 gigahertz.
