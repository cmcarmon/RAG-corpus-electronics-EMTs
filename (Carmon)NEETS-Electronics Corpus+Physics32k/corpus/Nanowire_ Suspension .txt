A suspended nanowire is a wire produced in a high-vacuum chamber held at the longitudinal extremities. Suspended nanowires can be produced by:
The chemical etching of a larger wire
The bombardment of a larger wire, typically with highly energetic ions
Indenting the tip of a STM in the surface of a metal near its melting point, and then retracting it
