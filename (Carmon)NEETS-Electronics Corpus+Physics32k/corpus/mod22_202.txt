Ink jet printers employ a technique very similar to the way we use a can of spray paint and a stencil. 
A spray of electrically charged ink is shot (under pressure) toward the paper. Before reaching the paper, 
the ink is passed through an electrical field which forms the letters in a matrix form. The print resulting 
from this process consists of easy to read, high-quality characters. Some manufacturers use large droplets 
of ink for faster printing, while others use small droplets for better clarity but with slightly reduced 
printing speeds. These printers can print up to 300 cps (characters per second).
