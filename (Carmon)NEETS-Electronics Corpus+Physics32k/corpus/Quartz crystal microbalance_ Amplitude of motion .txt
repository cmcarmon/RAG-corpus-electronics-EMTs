The amplitude of lateral displacement rarely exceeds a nanometer. More specifically one has

{\displaystyle u_{0}={\frac {4}{\left(n\pi \right)^{2}}}dQU_{\mathrm {el} }}

with u0 the amplitude of lateral displacement, n the overtone order, d the piezoelectric strain coefficient, Q the quality factor, and Uel the amplitude of electrical driving. The piezoelectric strain coefficient is given as d = 3.1·10‑12 m/V for AT-cut quartz crystals. Due to the small amplitude, stress and strain usually are proportional to each other. The QCM operates in the range of linear acoustics.
