Two-Terminal, or Point-to-Point, DC Transmission
Two-terminal dc systems can be either bipolar or monopolar. Bipolar conﬁguration, shown in Fig. 61.7, is the
commonly used arrangement for systems with overhead lines. In this system, there will be two conductors, one
for each polarity (positive and negative) carrying nearly equal currents. Only the difference of these currents,
which is usually small, ﬂows through ground return.
