During the Spider-Island storyline, the Young Allies are seen defending New York. On the Hudson River bridge, Gravity fights against the Spider-King, who was actually Steve Rogers. Venom (Flash Thompson), arrived and fought the spider-beast but was having trouble focusing on the mission. He decided that after this mission heâ€™s done being Venom. He spotted Gravity and threw him in the air. Spider-King approached him and threatened to kill him if he did not step aside. Gravity fell down on the spider-beast and knocked him out. Working with the other Avengers, they are able to save New York. Gravity was among the many heroes attacked by Carrion who posed as the Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus's mind in Spider-Man's body).
