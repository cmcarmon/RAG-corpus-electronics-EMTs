Standards committees are addressing fiber optic part and test standardization. The cost to install fiber
optic systems is falling because of an increase in the use of fiber optic technology. Published articles,
conferences, and lectures on fiber optics have begun to educate managers and technicians. As the
technology matures, the use of fiber optics will increase because of its many advantages over electrical
systems.
