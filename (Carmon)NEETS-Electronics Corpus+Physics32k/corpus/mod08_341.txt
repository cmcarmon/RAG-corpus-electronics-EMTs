An OPERATIONAL AMPLIFIER (OP AMP) is an amplifier which is designed to be used with
other circuit components to perform either computing functions (addition, subtraction) or some type of
transfer operation, such as filtering. Operational amplifiers are usually high-gain amplifiers with the
amount of gain determined by feedback.
