Specific kinetic energy is kinetic energy of an object per unit of mass.
It is defined as








e

k


=


1
2







v

2




{\displaystyle {\begin{matrix}e_{k}={\frac {1}{2}}\end{matrix}}v^{2}}
.
Where




e

k




{\displaystyle e_{k}}
is the specific kinetic energy and



v


{\displaystyle v}
is velocity. It has units of J/kg, which is equivalent to m2/s2.
