In an attempt to
model what the brain might do, RU signal processors want to design an optimal system that delays each
ear’s signal by some amount then adds them together. ∆l and ∆r are the delays applied to the left and right
signals respectively. The idea is to determine the delay values according to some criterion that is based on
what is measured by the two ears.
(a) What is the transfer function between the sound signal s (t) and the processor output y (t)?
(b) One way of determining the delay τ is to choose ∆l and ∆r to maximize the power in y (t). How are
