linear n-bit input
numbers, the distribution of bit assertions of the correspond-
ing LNS words reveals that LNS can be exploited to reduce the
average activity. Let p0!1(i) be the bit assertion probabilities
(i.e., the probability of the ith bit transition from 0 to 1).
Assuming that data are temporarily independent, it holds that:
