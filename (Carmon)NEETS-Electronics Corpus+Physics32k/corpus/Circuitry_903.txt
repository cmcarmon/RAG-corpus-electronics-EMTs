stage  was  that  of  measuring  its  performance  in 
order  to  ensure  that  it  fully  conformed  with  the 
requirements set down in the design brief.  
  Prototype  testing  was  carried  out  by  applying  a 
variable load to the output of the power supply and 
measuring  corresponding  values  of  output  voltage 
and  output  current.  To  simplify  the  analysis,  the 
test data was entered into a spreadsheet and graphs 
of  each  load  test  were  generated  (see  Figs  19.45 
and 19.46). 
 
Performance measurement 
 
The  measured  performance  specifications  for  the 
power supply (obtained from the load tests) were as 
follows 
the  original  design 
specification are shown in square brackets): 
 
Fixed output 
 
(cid:127) Minimum output voltage = 2.85V [3 V] 
(cid:127) Maximum output voltage = 15.23 V [15 V] 
(cid:127) Maximum output current = 1.2 A [1 A] 
Variable output 
 
(cid:127) Output voltage (no load) = 4.94 V [5 V] 
(cid:127) Output voltage (1 A load) = 4.77 V  [4.75 V]  
(cid:127) Output current = 1.2 A [1 A]
