The Gray code has only a 1-bit difference in consecutive
numbers for addressing. Due to locality of program execution,
Gray code addressing can signiÔ¨Åcantly reduce the number of
bit switches. Experimental results show that for typical pro-
grams running on an RISC microprocessor, using Gray code
addressing reduces the switching activity at the address lines by
30 to 50% compared to using normal binary code addressing.
In TO Encoding, the bus transitions are reduced by freezing
the address lines when consecutive patterns are found to be
sequential. An extra bus line is employed to inform the receiver
side regardless if the current pattern is sequential.
