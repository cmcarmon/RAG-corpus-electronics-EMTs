A signal is a function that carries some information. Mathemat-
ically, a signal can be classiÔ¨Åed as deterministic or random. For a
deterministic signal, there is no uncertainty with respect to its
value at any time. Deterministic signals are modeled by explicit
mathematical expressions. For a random signal, there is some
degree of uncertainty before the signal occurs. A probabilistic
model is used to characterize a random signal. Noise in a
communication system is an example of the random signal.
