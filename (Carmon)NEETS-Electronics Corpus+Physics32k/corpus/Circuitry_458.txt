Procedure 
 
Connect the circuit shown in Fig. 9.19 with C = 47 
nF.  Set  the  oscilloscope  timebase  to  the  2  ms/cm 
range  and  Y-attenuator  to  1  V/cm.  Adjust  the 
oscilloscope  so  that  it  triggers  on  a  positive  edge 
and  display  the  output  waveform  produced  by  the 
oscillator. Make a sketch of the waveform using the  
graph layout shown in Fig. 9.20.  
  Measure  and  record  (using  Table  9.1)  the  time 
for  one  complete  cycle  of  the  output.  Repeat  this 
measurement with C = 10 nF, 22 nF and 100 nF. 
 
Calculations 
For each value of C, calculate the periodic time of 
the  oscillatorâ€™s  output  and  compare  this  with  the 
measured values.
