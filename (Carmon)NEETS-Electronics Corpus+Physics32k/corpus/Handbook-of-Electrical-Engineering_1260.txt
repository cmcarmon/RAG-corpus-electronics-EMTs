Nonnegative-Deﬁnite Toeplitz-Hermitian Matrix Approximation
It is possible to employ the concept of signal restoration in a straightforward fashion to iteratively solve the
two problems considered at the beginning of this section. We will demonstrate a solution procedure by treating
the problem in which it is desired to ﬁnd that unique nonnegative-deﬁnite Toeplitz-Hermitian matrix which
lies closest to a given matrix X ˛ C n ·  n. To employ the concept of signal restoration to this problem, we now
identify the two attribute sets in which the required approximating matrix must lie, namely,
