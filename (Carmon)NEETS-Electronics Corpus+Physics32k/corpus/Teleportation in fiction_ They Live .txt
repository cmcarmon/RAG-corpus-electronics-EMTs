In They Live a nameless drifter referred to as "Nada" discovers that the ruling class of Earth are in fact aliens concealing their appearance and manipulating people with subliminal messages in mass media. Teleportation is their chief mode of transport, which is used either as a wristwatch for shorter distances, or on a platform in an underground station which beams out into space (for longer distances).
