A newer approach of partial rerouting only in faulty tiles—a
tile is a subarray of logic cells including a spare cell—has been
proposed by Lach et al. (1998); this is a signiﬁcant improve-
ment over past full rerouting methods. In this technique, fast
reconﬁguration is achieved by precomputing all possible con-
ﬁgurations of a tile (assuming one fault in it) and storing them
for loading into the tile as and when a fault is detected.
However, this technique has some of the other disadvantages
of full rerouting methods. A rip-up-and-reroute approach for
