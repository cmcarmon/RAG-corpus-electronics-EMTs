As time went by, it was discovered that inductor capacitor
(LC) ﬁlters were not suitable for many applications, espe-
cially in low frequency regions where inductors are large and
heavy. An idea occurred: replace the inductors by active net-
works composed of ampliﬁers with feedback by means
of resistors and/or capacitors. This was the era of active net-
