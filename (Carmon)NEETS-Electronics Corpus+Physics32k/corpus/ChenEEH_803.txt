The object class quantity has the following properties:
representation of time-dependent functions, partial continuity
with a ﬁnite number of discontinuities in one time interval,
assignment of physical dimension, and existence of derivatives
and integrals. Quantities may be deﬁned as free, branch, or
source quantities. Figure 3.7 shows their classiﬁcation. Note
that by means of this single basic concept, mixed descriptions
in terms of domains, modes, and technologies are achievable.
