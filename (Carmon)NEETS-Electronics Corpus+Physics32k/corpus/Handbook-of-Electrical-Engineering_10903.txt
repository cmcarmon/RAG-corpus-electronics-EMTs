BEACON  allows  the  user  to  graphically  design  a  complete  real-time  controller  as  a  series  of  hierarchical
block diagrams. These diagrams can thereafter be automatically converted into a variety of computer languages
for either control analysis, simulation, or real-time computer code, as illustrated in Fig. 112.13.
