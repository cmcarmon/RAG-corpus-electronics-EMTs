The ideal gas law can be derived from combining two empirical gas laws: the combined gas law and Avogadro's law. The combined gas law states that







P
V

T


=
C
,


{\displaystyle {\frac {PV}{T}}=C,}

where C is a constant that is directly proportional to the amount of gas, n (Avogadro's law). The proportionality factor is the universal gas constant, R, i.e. C = nR.
Hence the ideal gas law is




P
V
=
n
R
T
.


{\displaystyle PV=nRT.}
