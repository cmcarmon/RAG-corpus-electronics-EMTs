Solution: First, a diagram, such as the one shown in figure 3-23, is drawn. Next, a direction of
current is assumed (as shown). Using this current, the polarity markings are placed at each end of each
resistor and also on the terminals of the source. Starting at point A, trace around the circuit in the
direction of current flow, recording the voltage and polarity of each component. Starting at point A and
using the components from the circuit:
