Although it rarely happens, a glider can be struck by lightning. Metal sailplanes are Faraday cages and thus should not be destroyed by a lightning strike. However, gliders made of wood or fibreglass can be destroyed. Moreover, modern sailplanes are filled with electronic devices that can be damaged by lightning. Also, any winch launch must be prohibited when a thunderstorm is less than 20 kilometres (12 mi) away. Indeed, the air is electrified, and the cable will act as a lightning rod.
