In HPrTNs, the interface of a transition includes a box with
a name and the labels of relevant arcs (the label identiﬁers
determining the calling context and the ﬂow expressions spe-
cifying parameters). The meaning of an elementary transition
is deﬁned by its constraint, and the meaning of a super transi-
tion is deﬁned through its corresponding subnet.
