This high voltage is usable where little power is required, such as in driving the grid of a vacuum 
tube or the gate of a field effect transistor (F.E.T.). The gain of a properly designed series-resonant circuit 
may be as great or greater than the amplification within the amplifier itself. The gain is a function of Q, as 
shown in the following example:
