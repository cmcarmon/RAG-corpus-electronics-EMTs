Most meter movements in use today have sensitivities of from 5 microamperes to 1 milliampere.
Figure 1-22 shows the circuit of meter switched to higher ranges, the shunt an ammeter that uses a meter
movement with a sensitivity of 100 microamperes and shunt resistors. This ammeter has five ranges (100
microamperes; 1, 10, and 100 milliamperes; 1 ampere) selected by a switch.
