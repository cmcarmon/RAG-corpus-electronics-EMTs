can set up a circuit, such as the one 
shown in Figure 5­5, to divide the voltage 
in a way that provides 5 V at the output. 
Then — voilà — you can use the output 
voltage, Vout, of this voltage divider as the 
supply voltage for your integrated cir­
cuit. (You find details of how this works 
in Chapter 6.)
