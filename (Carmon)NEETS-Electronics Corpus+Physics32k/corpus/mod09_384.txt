Let's take a more detailed look at the circuit conditions in this stable state (refer to figure 3-12). As 
stated above, Q1 is cut off, so no current flows through R1, and the collector of Q1 is at âˆ’VCC. Q2 is 
saturated and has practically no voltage drop across it, so its collector is essentially at 0 volts. R5 and R3 
form a voltage divider from VBB to the ground potential at the collector of Q2. The tie point between these 
two resistors will be positive. Thus, the base of Q1 is held positive, ensuring that Q1 remains cutoff. Q2
