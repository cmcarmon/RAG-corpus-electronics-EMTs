3. Energize the synchro circuit and turn the stator until the meter reads about 37 volts (15 volts for a 
26-volt synchro). Should the voltmeter read approximately 193 volts (115 volts + 78 volts = 193 
volts), the rotor is at 180ยบ. Turn it through a half revolution to bring it back to 0ยบ. If you cannot 
obtain the desired 37 (or 15) volts, use the lowest reading you can take with the meter. This is the 
coarse setting and places the synchro approximately on electrical zero.
