With zero current flowing in the plate circuit, there is no voltage drop across RL. The entire plate-
supply voltage, Ebb (300 volts), appears as plate voltage between the cathode and the plate. This is shown
at time b in the output signal waveform. Between time b and time c, the grid voltage is greater than -24
volts. The plate current remains cutoff, and the plate voltage remains at +300. The output waveform
between time b and time c cannot follow the input because the plate voltage cannot increase above +300
volts. The output waveform is "flattopped." This condition is known as AMPLITUDE DISTORTION.
