Three-Terminal Active Microwave Devices
The high-frequency performance of three-terminal semiconductor devices has improved dramatically during
the past two decades. Twenty years ago transistors that could provide useful gain at frequencies above 10 GHz
were  a  laboratory  curiosity.  Today,  such  devices  are  readily  available,  and  state-of-the-art  transistors  operate
well  above  100  GHz.  This  dramatic  improvement  has  been  achieved  by  advances  in  semiconductor  growth
technology, coupled with improved device design and fabrication techniques. Semiconductor materials tech-
nology continues to improve and new device structures that offer improved high-frequency performance are
continually being reported.
