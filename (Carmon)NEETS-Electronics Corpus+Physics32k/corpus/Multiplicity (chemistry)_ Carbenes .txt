In organic chemistry, carbenes are molecules which have carbon atoms with only have six valence electrons and therefore disobey the octet rule. Carbenes generally split into singlet carbenes and triplet carbenes, named for their spin multiplicities. Both have two non-bonding electrons; in singlet carbenes these exist as a lone pair and have opposite spins so that there is no net spin, while in triplet carbenes these electrons have parallel spins.
