The Orion Abort Test Booster (ATB) is a small solid rocket launcher being developed by Orbital ATK Corporation under contract by U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center, Experimental Launch & Test [SMC/LEX].
Its goal will be to demonstrate and qualify the Orion Launch Abort System (LAS) that will allow the astronaut crew to safely escape in the event of an emergency during launch pad operations, through the ascent phase of the Orion vehicle.
