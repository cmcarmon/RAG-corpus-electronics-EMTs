During the first half of the cycle, the load capacitor CL is discharged, and during the
second half of the cycle, it is charged up to the supply voltage. Since static and dynamic
currents donâ€™t flow simultaneously in CMOS devices, we can compute the average
dynamic power dissipated using the following very simple method.
