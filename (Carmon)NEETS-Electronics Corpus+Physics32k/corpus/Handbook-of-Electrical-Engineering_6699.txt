On the other hand, the media of the three types of access protocols provide transmission service in different
ways, so software is needed to bridge the gap between what the user of the service needs, which is provided by
the LLC, and how the LLC uses the media to provide the required service. Thus, the MAC sublayer was born.
This idea has proven to be valuable as new types of technologies have become available. For example, the
new Ô¨Åber-distributed digital interface (FDDI) uses the LLC of all other LAN protocols, but its MAC is completely
different  from  the  token  ring  MAC  even  though  FDDI  is  a  token  ring  protocol.  Reasons  for  needing  a  new
MAC for LLC are provided in Stallings [1990b].
