Video is a sequence of images or frames displayed at a certain
rate (e.g., 24 or 30 frames per second). Digitized video, like
digitized audio, is also transmitted as a stream of discrete
packets over the network. The bandwidth requirements for
digitized video depend on the spatial redundancy present
in every frame as well as the temporal redundancy present in
consecutive frames. Both these redundancies can be exploited
to achieve efÔ¨Åcient compression of video data. Table 7.4, illus-
trates some common compression schemes that are used in
video (Watkinson, 2001).
