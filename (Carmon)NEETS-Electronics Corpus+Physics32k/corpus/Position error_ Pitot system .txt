Bernoulli's principle states that total pressure (or stagnation pressure) is constant along a streamline. There is no variation in stagnation pressure, regardless of the position on the streamline where it is measured. There is no position error associated with stagnation pressure.
The Pitot tube supplies pressure to the airspeed indicator. Pitot pressure is equal to stagnation pressure providing the Pitot tube is aligned with the local airflow, it is located outside the boundary layer, and outside the wash from the propeller. Pitot pressure can suffer alignment error but it is not vulnerable to position error.
