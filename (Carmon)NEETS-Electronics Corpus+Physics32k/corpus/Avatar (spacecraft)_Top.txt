Avatar (Sanskrit: अवतार) (from "Aerobic Vehicle for Transatmospheric Hypersonic Aerospace TrAnspoRtation") is a concept study for a robotic single-stage reusable spaceplane capable of horizontal takeoff and landing, by India's Defence Research and Development Organisation. The mission concept is for low cost military and commercial satellite space launches. The first scaled down trial took place in 2016 and the first flight of AVATAR is scheduled in 2025.
This spaceplane concept is unrelated to India's RLV Technology Demonstration Programme (RLV-TD).
