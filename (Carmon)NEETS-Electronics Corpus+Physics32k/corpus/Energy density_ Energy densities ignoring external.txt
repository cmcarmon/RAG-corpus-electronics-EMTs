This table lists energy densities of systems that require external components, such as oxidisers or a heat sink or source. These figures do not take into account the mass and volume of the required components as they are assumed to be freely available and present in the atmosphere. Such systems cannot be compared with self-contained systems. These values may not be computed at the same reference conditions.
* Technically the actual value of the fuel alone is half the number indicated, because in order to burn the fuel must be mixed with 2 parts oxygen to 1 part fuel. In an oxygen-free environment the actual value is 0 as the fuel will not burn at all.
Divide joule metreâˆ’3 by 109 to get MJ/L. Divide MJ/L by 3.6 to get kWh/L.
