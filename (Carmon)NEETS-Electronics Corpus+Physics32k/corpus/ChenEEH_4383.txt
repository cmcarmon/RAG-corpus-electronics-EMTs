where x(t) 2 Rn is a vector of state variables, any minimal set
of variables at time t0 that together with the input u(t ), t > t0
completely characterizes the response of the system for t > t0.
The state-space representation as deﬁned in equation 3.3 will
be represented by the four-tuple (A, B, C, D). The study of the
fundamental properties of the state-space representation is
covered, for example,
in a ﬁrst graduate course in linear
systems (Antsaklis and Michel, 1997.) Because any state-
space and PMD representation of a given system are equiva-
lent, they have similar properties. For example, the eigenvalues
of A are the roots of jP(l)j, where P(l) is the polynomial
matrix in l found by replacing D with l. Furthermore, the
state-space representation is state controllable (observable) if
and only if the equivalent PMD is controllable (observable).
