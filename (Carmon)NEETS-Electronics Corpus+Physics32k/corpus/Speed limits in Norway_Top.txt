Norway has two general speed limits:
50 km/h in densely populated areas.
80 km/h in sparsely populated areas.
The general speed limits for driving with trailers are:
50 km/h within towns.
80 km/h outside towns.
80 km/h on motorways with a speed limit of 80 km/h or higher.
Some areas may have lower or higher speed limits. On some roads, the speed limit is 90 km/h, and on the best motorways the limit is 110 km/h. Also, the general speed limits apply only for vehicles below 3.5 metric tons. Lower speed limits apply for larger vehicles. Currently, the maximum speed limit for all vehicles over 3500 kg and all vehicles carrying a trailer is 80 km/h.
Historically the motorway speed limits were 90 km/h before 2000 (there were not many of them and most had dense traffic). The motorway speed limits was raised to 100 km/h for less densely trafficked motorways in 2000, and to 110 km/h in 2014.
