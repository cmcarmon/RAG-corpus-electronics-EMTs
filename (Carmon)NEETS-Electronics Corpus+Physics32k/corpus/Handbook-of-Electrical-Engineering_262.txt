Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law
Kirchhoff ’s voltage law (KVL) describes a relationship among the voltages measured across the branches in any
closed,  connected  path  in  a  circuit.  Each  branch  in  a  circuit  is  connected  to  two  nodes.  For  the  purpose  of
applying KVL, a path has an orientation in the sense that in “walking” along the path one would enter one of
the  nodes  and  exit  the  other.  This  establishes  a  direction  for  determining  the  voltage  across  a  branch  in  the
path: the voltage is the difference between the potential of the node entered and the potential of the node at
which the path exits. Alternatively, the voltage drop along a branch is the difference of the node voltage at the
entered node and the node voltage at the exit node. For example, if a path includes a branch between node “a”
and node “b”, the voltage drop measured along the path in the direction from node “a” to node “b” is denoted
by vab and is given by vab = va – vb. Given vab, branch voltage along the path in the direction from node “b” to
node “a” is vba = vb – va = –vab .
