It is a simple matter to write the equations from the ï¬‚owgraph since every node, except the source nodes of
the graph, represents an equation, and the equation associated with node k, for example, is obtained by equating
to xk the sum of all incoming branch gains multiplied by the values of the variables from which these branches
originate.
