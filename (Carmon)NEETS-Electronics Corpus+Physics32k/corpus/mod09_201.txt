THE BANDWIDTH of a circuit is the range of frequencies between the half-power points. The 
limiting frequencies are those at either side of resonance at which the curve falls to .707 of the maximum 
value. If circuit Q is low, you will have a wide bandpass. If circuit Q is high, you will have a narrow 
bandpass.
