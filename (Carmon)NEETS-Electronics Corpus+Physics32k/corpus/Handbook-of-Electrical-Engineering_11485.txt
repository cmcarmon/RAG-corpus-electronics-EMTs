The  main  objective  of  this  section  is  to  provide  the  reader  with  a  summary  of  areas  that  relate  to  clinical
information systems. Since this ﬁeld is so wide, the following topics will be covered mainly because of their
importance  within  the  ﬁeld  of  medical  informatics  and  the  impact  that  these  areas  will  have  in  healthcare
delivery in the near future. At the end of this section there is a list of deﬁnitions that should help the reader
not used to related acronyms and a list of suggested bibliographic references which should allow those interested
to further increase their knowledge.
