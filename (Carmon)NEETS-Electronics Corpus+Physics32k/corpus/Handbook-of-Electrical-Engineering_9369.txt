3. Data acquisition, analysis, display, and technical reporting. Systems in this area have compute-intensive
analysis  routines  and  enhanced  visualization  of  data  which  capitalize  on  sharper  display  resolutions.
These  packages  could  produce  plots  and  graphs  based  on  acquired  data  that  are  displayed  in  several
windows at once; changes to one window could result in recalculation and updating of corresponding
windows.  Packages  in  this  area  frequently  have  support  for  standard  languages  and  graphical  user
interfaces for C and Fortran as well as the Unix X.11 interface or Microsoft’s Windows. Representative
packages are HP’s VEE-Test; Design Science’s MathType; DSP Development’s DADiSP; National Instru-
ments’ LabWindows; Speakeasy Computing’s Speakeasy Zeta, which features user-tailored graphical user
interface and PostScript output; and Mihalisin Associates’ Temple-Graph, which produces a color Post-
Script output link to
