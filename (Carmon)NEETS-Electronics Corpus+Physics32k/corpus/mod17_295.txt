The radio set control unit shown in figure 3-2 provides a capability to remotely control some 
radiophone transmitter functions and the receiver output. Some of the controls are used for turning the 
transmitter on and off. Others are used for voice modulating the transmission (or keying when cw 
operation is desired). You can even control the audio output level of the receiver and silence the receiver 
when transmitting.
