It will be assumed that the events are occurring randomly with an average frequency of f. That is, they constitute a Poisson process. The probability that an event will occur in an infinitesimal time interval dt is then f dt. It follows that the probability P(t) that an event will occur at time t  to t+dt with no events occurring between t=0 and time t  is given by the exponential distribution (Lucke 1974, Meeks 2008):
