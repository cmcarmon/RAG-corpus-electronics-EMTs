Many investigations using the phase plane technique were concerned with the possibility of limit cycles in
the  nonlinear  differential  equations When  a  limit  cycle  exists,  this  results  in  a  closed  trajectory  in  the  phase
plane. Typical of such investigations was the work of Van der Pol, who considered the equation
