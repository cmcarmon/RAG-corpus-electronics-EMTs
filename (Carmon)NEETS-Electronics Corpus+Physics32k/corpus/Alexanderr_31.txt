There  are  two  types  of  elements  found  in  electric  circuits:  pas-
sive elements  and  active elements.  An  active  element  is  capable  of
generating  energy  while  a  passive  element  is  not.  Examples  of  pas-
sive  elements  are  resistors,  capacitors,  and  inductors.  Typical  active
elements include generators, batteries, and operational ampliÔ¨Åers. Our
aim  in  this  section  is  to  gain  familiarity  with  some  important  active
elements.
