where the second equality results from the substitution of Equation 9.47 and
then Equation 9.46. Thus, we see that the reciprocal inductances of inductors
in parallel add. This is consistent with the physical derivation of inductance
in Equation 9.23 since placing inductors in parallel essentially increases the
cross-sectional area of the core around which the turns are wound.
