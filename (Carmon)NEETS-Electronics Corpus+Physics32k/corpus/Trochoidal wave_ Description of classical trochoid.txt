Using a Lagrangian specification of the flow field, the motion of fluid parcels is – for a periodic wave on the surface of a fluid layer of infinite depth:

where



x

{\displaystyle x=X(a,b,t)}
and



y

Y
(

{\displaystyle y=Y(a,b,t)}
are the positions of the fluid parcels in the

{\displaystyle (x,y)}
plane at time



t


{\displaystyle t}
, with



x


{\displaystyle x}
the horizontal coordinate and



y


{\displaystyle y}
the vertical coordinate (positive upward, in the direction opposing gravity). The Lagrangian coordinates

{\displaystyle (a,b)}
label the fluid parcels, with

the centres of the circular orbits – around which the corresponding fluid parcel moves with constant speed

Further



k

λ


{\displaystyle k=2\pi /\lambda }
is the wavenumber (and



λ


{\displaystyle \lambda }
the wavelength), while



c


{\displaystyle c}
is the phase speed with which the wave propagates in the



x


{\displaystyle x}
-direction. The phase speed satisfies the dispersion relation:





c

{\displaystyle c^{2}={\frac {g}{k}},}

which is independent of the wave nonlinearity (i.e. does not depend on the wave height



H


{\displaystyle H}
), and this phase speed



c


{\displaystyle c}
the same as for Airy's linear waves in deep water.
The free surface is a line of constant pressure, and is found to correspond with a line

{\displaystyle b=b_{s}}
, where




b

s




{\displaystyle b_{s}}
is a (nonpositive) constant. For




b

s

{\displaystyle b_{s}=0}
the highest waves occur, with a cusp-shaped crest. Note that the highest (irrotational) Stokes wave has a crest angle of 120°, instead of the 0° for the rotational trochoidal wave.
The wave height of the trochoidal wave is

{\displaystyle H=(2/k)\exp(kb_{s}).}
The wave is periodic in the
