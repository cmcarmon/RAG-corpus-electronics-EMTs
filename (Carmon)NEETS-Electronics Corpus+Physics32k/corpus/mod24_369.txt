Figure 4-6 shows the setup for the score-and-break procedure for fiber cleaving. Under constant
tension, the score-and-break method for cleaving fibers produces a quality fiber end. This fiber end is
good enough to use for some splicing techniques. However, additional fiber-end preparation is necessary
to produce reliable low-loss connections when using fiber optic connectors.
