Typically, CAD programs are based on formulating the
equations using matrix methods, and the equations are
then solved using numerical methods. For ease in pro-
gramming, methods that are general and straightforward
are preferred. This chapter assumes that the reader is familiar
with methods for solving a set of simultaneous linear equa-
tions.
