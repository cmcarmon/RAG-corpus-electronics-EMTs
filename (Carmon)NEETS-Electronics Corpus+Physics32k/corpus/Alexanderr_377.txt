The  various  devices  in  which  RC and  RL circuits  ﬁnd  applications
include ﬁltering in dc power supplies, smoothing circuits in digital com-
munications, differentiators, integrators, delay circuits, and relay circuits.
Some of these applications take advantage of the short or long time con-
stants  of  the  RC or  RL circuits.  We  will  consider  four  simple  applica-
tions here. The ﬁrst two are RC circuits, the last two are RL circuits.
