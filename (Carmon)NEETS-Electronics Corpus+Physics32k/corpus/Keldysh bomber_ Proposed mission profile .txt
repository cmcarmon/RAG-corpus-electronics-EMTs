The 100 tonne craft would be accelerated to 500 m/s using a sled running along a 3 km track and powered by five or six RKDS-100 rocket engines of 600 tonnes total thrust. Separation velocity would be reached 11 seconds after ignition.
After separation from the sled, the craft would climb using its main RKDS-100 rocket engine and two wingtip-mounted ramjets which would accelerate it to an altitude of 20 km and a speed of over Mach 3.
The rocket would continue working after the ramjets had flamed out at high altitude; it had a specific impulse of 285 seconds, a thrust of 100 tonnes, and used Liquid oxygen/Kerosene propellants.
