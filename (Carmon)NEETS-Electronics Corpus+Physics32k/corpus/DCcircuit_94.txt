As before, with no ﬂow of electrons, the entire potential (voltage) of the battery is available
across the break, waiting for the opportunity of a connection to bridge across that break and
permit electron ﬂow again. This condition is known as an open circuit, where a break in the
continuity of the circuit prevents current throughout. All it takes is a single break in continuity
to ”open” a circuit. Once any breaks have been connected once again and the continuity of the
circuit re-established, it is known as a closed circuit.
