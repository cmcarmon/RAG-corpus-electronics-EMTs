Decomposition Methods for the Covariance Solution
The covariance method equations to be solved are of the form
of equation 3.16. Similar to the autocorrelation matrix Rs, the
covariance matrix Fs
is symmetric and positive deÔ¨Ånite.
Unlike Rs, however, Fs
it is not Toeplitz, so there is less
structure to exploit the solution. The most common solution
