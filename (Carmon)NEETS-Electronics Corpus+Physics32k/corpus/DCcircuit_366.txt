This difference in current between the ”hot” and ”neutral” conductors will only exist if there
is current through the ground connection, meaning that there is a fault in the system. There-
fore, such a current difference can be used as a way to detect a fault condition. If a device is
set up to measure this difference of current between the two power conductors, a detection of
current imbalance can be used to trigger the opening of a disconnect switch, thus cutting power
off and preventing serious shock:
