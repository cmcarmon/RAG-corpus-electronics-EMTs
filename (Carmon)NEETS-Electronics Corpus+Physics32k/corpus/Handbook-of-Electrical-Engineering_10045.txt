where  δ(t)  is  the  Dirac  delta.  Noise  v(t)  is  called  the  plant  noise,  and  w(t)  is  the  measurement  noise,  often
representing  sensor  noise.  (By  assuming  these  signals  are  ﬁrst  passed  through  auxiliary  ﬁlters  with  speciﬁed
dynamics, these noises can be made to resemble harmonic or narrow-band disturbances.)
