Hanchek, 1997). The cells are either 1-bit or 4-bit carry look-
ahead (CLA) adders. REMOD was also applied to multipliers
based on a Wallace tree and on a carry-save array for the sum-
mation of partial product terms (Dutt and Hanchek, 1997). The
multipliers are partitioned into arrays of independent subcells,
but the high time overhead normally associated with independ-
ent cells is masked through a clever application of REMOD.
Original and checking computations overlap in time between
adjacent rows of subcells as the computations proceed down the
array or Wallace tree. The designs were laid out using the Berke-
ley MAGIC tools for CMOS. The multiplier designs were
implemented in CMOS dynamic logic. Delay elements were
implemented as strings of
inverters. Error injection gates
were inserted into the layout to simulate stuck-at faults. The
layout tools allow geometry information to be extracted and
converted to SPICE parameters. Simulations of the circuits
using delay element pipelining were then performed using
HSPICE. The simulations successfully tested the functions of
error detection and reconﬁguration, with selected nodes in the
SPICE ﬁles for the circuits forced to logic high or low to simulate
faults.
