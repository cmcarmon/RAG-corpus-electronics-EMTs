Circuit	categories	 describe	 the	 voltage	levels,	 as	 well	 as	 their	 electric	 flow	 over
time;	 they	 refer	 to	 how	 much	 and	 how	 powerful	 the	 current	 is	 as	 it	 enters	 and
passes	through	each	point	in	a	circuit.	Since	they	vary,	itâ€™s	listed	as	an	effective
way	of	understanding	circuit	systems	of	sorts	if	they	are	categorized.
