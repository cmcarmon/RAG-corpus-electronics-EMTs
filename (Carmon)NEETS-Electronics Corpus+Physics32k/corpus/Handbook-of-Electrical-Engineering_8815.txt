Dynamic Types
The carrier sets of dynamic types contain objects of vastly different size. For these types, variables (memory
space) must be allocated dynamically, i.e., at run time, when the actual sizes of objects are known. Examples
for dynamic types are character strings, lists, tree structures, sets, and graphs. A classical example of a dynamic
type is a special type of a list: a queue. As the name suggests, a queue object is a sequence of other objects with
the particular restrictive property that objects are inspected at and removed from its front and added to its rear.
