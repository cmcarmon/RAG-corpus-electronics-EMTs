Extrinsic absorption also occurs when hydroxyl ions (OH -) are introduced into the fiber. Water in
silica glass forms a silicon-hydroxyl (Si-OH) bond. This bond has a fundamental absorption at 2700 nm.
However, the harmonics or overtones of the fundamental absorption occur in the region of operation.
These harmonics increase extrinsic absorption at 1383 nm, 1250 nm, and 950 nm. Figure 2-21 shows the
presence of the three OH� harmonics. The level of the OH� harmonic absorption is also indicated.
