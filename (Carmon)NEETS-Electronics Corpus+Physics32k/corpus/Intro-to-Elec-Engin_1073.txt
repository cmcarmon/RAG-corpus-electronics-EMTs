*12.4.12 Consider an elementary cylindrical-rotor two-
phase synchronous machine with uniform air
gap, as illustrated in the schematic diagram in
Figure P12.4.12. It is similar to that of Figure
E12.4.1, except that Figure P12.4.12 has two
identical stator windings in quadrature instead
of one. The self-inductance of the rotor or Ô¨Åeld
winding is a constant given by Lff H; the self-
inductance of each stator winding is a constant
