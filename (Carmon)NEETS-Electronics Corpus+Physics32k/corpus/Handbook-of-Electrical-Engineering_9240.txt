U.S. military veriﬁcation and validation has developed its own argot, and those interested in the full set of U.S.
military  veriﬁcation  and  validation  steps  should  refer  to  the  military  standards  themselves  or  to  some  of  the
specialized  books  that  deal  with  this  topic.  Examples  of  the  forms  of  veriﬁcation  and  validation  used  on  U.S.
military projects, and the three-letter abbreviations by which they are commonly known, include system require-
ments review (SRR), system design review (SDR), preliminary design review (PDR), critical design review (CDR).
The defect removal efﬁciencies of the various forms of military review have not been published, but there
is no reason to doubt that they are equivalent or even superior to similar reviews in the civilian domain. The
cumulative defect removal efﬁciency of the full series of U.S. military defect removal operations is rather good:
from about 94% to well over 99% for critical weapons systems.
