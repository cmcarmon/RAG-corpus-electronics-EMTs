Hamwind, with respective sizes of 26,400 and 2400
integer elements. Observe that the loop nest has non-
rectangular access patterns dominated by accesses to
the temporary variable ac_inter‘. Thus to reduce
power, we need to reduce the number of memory
accesses to ac_inter‘. This is possible only by ﬁrst
reducing the size of ac_inter‘ and then placing this
signal in a local memory.
