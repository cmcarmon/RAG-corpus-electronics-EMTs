Signal racing is the condition when two or more signals change almost simultaneously. The
condition may cause glitches or spikes in the output signal as shown in ﬁgure 7.6. The eﬀects
of these glitches can be eliminated by using synchronous timing techniques. In synchronous
timing the glitches are allowed to come and go, and the logic state changes are initiated by
a timing pulse (clock pulse).
