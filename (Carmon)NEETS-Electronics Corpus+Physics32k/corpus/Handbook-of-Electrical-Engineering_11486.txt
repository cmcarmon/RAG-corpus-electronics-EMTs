Computer-Based Record
Besides  improvements  in  patient  care,  enhancing  the  productivity  of  physicians,  nurses,  and  all  healthcare-
related personnel is very high on the agenda of all hospitals. Hospitals, clinics, HMOs, doctors’ ofﬁces, emer-
gency  care  centers,  group  practices,  laboratories,  radiology  clinics,  and  nursing  homes  among  others  have  a
need to share patients’ records. Aside from the direction that all of these medical-related centers will have with
a  required  connection  to  the  insurance  companies/agencies  to  speed  up  payments  and  their  accuracy,  the
growing need is to have the ability to transfer patients’ medical ﬁles electronically anywhere in the world. As
medical  centers  become  more  competitive,  they  will  become  worldwide  centers  of  excellence  for  their  given
specialties. In turn then, their services will be marketed to the entire world population, becoming true global
resources.
