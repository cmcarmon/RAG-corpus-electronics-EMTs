Minority Charge and Transit Time
Classical theory assumes that minority charge storage only
occurs in the neutral base; according to equation 5.11, the
injected electron density decreases linearly,
leading to the
stored minority charge QnB Â¼ qAEnBe(wB=2). Derivative with
respect to ITf gives the base transit time of a diffusion transis-
tor (i.e., a transistor with a spatially constant base doping)
operated at low current densities:
