BIBO stable: A system is Bounded Input Bounded Output stable if for all bounded inputs and zero initial
conditions,  the  corresponding  output  is  also  bounded.  In  the  case  of  ﬁnite-dimensional  linear  time
invariant systems, this deﬁnition is equivalent to having all the poles of the system in the open left half
plane Re(s) < 0.
