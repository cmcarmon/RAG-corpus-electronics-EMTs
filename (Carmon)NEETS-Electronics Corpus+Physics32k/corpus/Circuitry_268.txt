JFET parameters 
 
The  gain  offered  by  a  field  effect  transistor  is 
its  forward 
normally  expressed 
transfer  conductance  (gfs  or  Yfs) in  common- 
source  mode.  In  this  mode,  the  input  voltage  is 
applied to the gate and the output current appears in 
the drain (the source is effectively common to both 
the input and output circuits). 
  The 
common-source 
conductance is given by:
