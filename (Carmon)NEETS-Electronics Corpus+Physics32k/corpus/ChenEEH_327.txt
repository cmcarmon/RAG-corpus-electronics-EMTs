it is also evident that the
electron distribution is highest near the source and lowest
near the drain. To keep a constant current throughout the
channel,
the electrons travel slower near the source and
speed up near the drain. In fact, in the pinch-off region, the
electron density is negligibly small. Therefore, in this region, to
maintain the same current level, the electrons have to travel at
much higher speeds to transport the same magnitude of
charge.
