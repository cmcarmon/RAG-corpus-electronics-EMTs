A mechanical amplifier, or a mechanical amplifying element, is a linkage mechanism that amplifies the magnitude of mechanical quantities such as force, displacement, velocity, acceleration and torque in linear and rotational systems. In some applications, mechanical amplification induced by nature or unintentional oversights in man-made designs can be disastrous. When employed appropriately, it can help to magnify small mechanical signals for practical applications.
However, conservation of energy still holds and any claims otherwise (over unity) do not constitute part of mainstream science. No additional energy can be created from any given mechanical amplifier. Therefore, a distinction exist between the scientific definition of a "mechanical amplifier" and the same term loosely used by proponents of over unity, due to either a lack of understanding of the working mechanism by the claimants or simply a hoax.
