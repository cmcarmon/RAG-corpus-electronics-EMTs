A solenoid is similar to a relay (Figure 18-17). 
A coil, when energized, pulls a plunger that does 
some mechanical work. This is used on some door 
chimes where the plunger strikes a metal bar. It is 
also used on automotive starters. The plunger pulls 
the starter gear in to engage the flywheel to start 
the engine.
