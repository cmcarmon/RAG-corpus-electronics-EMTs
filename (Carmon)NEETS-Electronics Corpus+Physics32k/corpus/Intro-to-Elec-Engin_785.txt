TTL NAND Gate
The TTL logic family uses only transistors instead of a combination of transistors and diodes.
TTL has the same high and low ranges as DTL. TTL is the most popular BJT logic family. A
primary reason for the popularity of TTL over DTL is its higher speed. TTL has a typical fan-out
of 10 or more, small propagation delays on the order of 2 to 10 ns, and a power consumption
of about 2 mW. By contrast, DTL has a typical fan-out of 8 to 10, a propagation delay on
the order of 30 to 90 ns, and a power consumption of around 15 mW. The noise margins and
fan-out of DTL are generally better than those of RTL (resistorâ€“transistor logic; see Problem
9.2.8), but the switching speeds are about the same. The emitter-coupled logic (ECL) family
is also available with increased switching times, although not discussed here in any detail.
The name arises from the common attachment of the emitters of the input transistors. The
propagation delays are on the order of 1 ns, but the power consumption is quite high (on the
order of 25 mW per gate). Low power consumption combined with relatively small noise margins
(< 0.3 V) has made TTL a popular choice and, in particular, the high-speed Schottky diode
TTL gates.
