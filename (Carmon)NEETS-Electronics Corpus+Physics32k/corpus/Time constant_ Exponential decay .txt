In exponential decay, such as of a radioactive isotope, the time constant can be interpreted as the mean lifetime. The half-life THL is related to the exponential time constant

{\displaystyle T_{HL}=\tau \cdot \mathrm {ln} \,2.}

The reciprocal of the time constant is called the decay constant, and is denoted
