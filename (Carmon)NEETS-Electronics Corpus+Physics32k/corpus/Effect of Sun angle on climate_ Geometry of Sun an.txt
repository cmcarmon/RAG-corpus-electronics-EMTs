When sunlight shines on the earth at a lower angle (Sun closer to the horizon), the energy of the sunlight is spread over a larger area, and is therefore weaker than if the Sun is higher overhead and the energy is concentrated on a smaller area.
Figure 2 depicts a sunbeam one mile (1.6 km) wide falling on the ground from directly overhead, and another hitting the ground at a 30째 angle. Trigonometry tells us that the sine of a 30째 angle is 1/2, whereas the sine of a 90째 angle is 1. Therefore, the sunbeam hitting the ground at a 30째 angle spreads the same amount of light over twice as much area (if we imagine the Sun shining from the south at noon, the north-south width doubles; the east-west width does not). Consequently, the amount of light falling on each square mile is only half as much.

Figure 3 shows the angle of sunlight striking the earth in the Northern and Southern hemispheres when the Earth's northern axis is tilted away from the Sun, when it is winter in the north and summer in the south.
