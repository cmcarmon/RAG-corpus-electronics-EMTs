Power MOSFET
Power  MOSFETs  are  marketed  by  different  manufacturers  with  differences  in  internal  geometry  and  with
different names such as MegaMOS, HEXFET, SIPMOS, and TMOS. They have unique features that make them
potentially attractive for switching applications. They are essentially voltage-driven rather than current-driven
devices, unlike bipolar transistors.
