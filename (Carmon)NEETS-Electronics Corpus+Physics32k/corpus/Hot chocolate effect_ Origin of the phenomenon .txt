The phenomenon is explained by the effect of bubble density on the speed of sound in the liquid. The note heard is the frequency of a standing wave where a quarter wavelength is the distance between the base of the mug and the liquid surface. This frequency f is equal to the speed v of the wave divided by four times the height of the water column h:

v

{\displaystyle f={\frac {1}{4}}{\frac {v}{h}}}

The speed of sound v in a homogeneous liquid or gas is dependent on the fluid's mass density (



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
) and Adiabatic Bulk modulus (



K


{\displaystyle K}
), according to the Newton-Laplace formula:




v

{\displaystyle v={\sqrt {\frac {K}{\rho }}}}

Water is approximately 800 times denser than air, and air is approximately 15,000 times more compressible than water. When water is filled with air bubbles, however, the fluid's density is very close to the density of water, but the compressibility will be the compressibility of air. This greatly reduces the speed of sound in the liquid. Wavelength is constant for a given volume of fluid, therefore the frequency (pitch) of the sound will decrease as long as gas bubbles are present.
Different rates of bubble formation will generate different acoustic profiles, allowing differentiation of the added solutes.
