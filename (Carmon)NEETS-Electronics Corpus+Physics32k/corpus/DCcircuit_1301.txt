Referencing the natural magnetic properties of iron (Latin = ”ferrum”), a ferromagnetic
material is one that readily magnetizes (its constituent atoms easily orient their electron spins
to conform to an external magnetic ﬁeld force). All materials are magnetic to some degree,
and those that are not considered ferromagnetic (easily magnetized) are classiﬁed as either
paramagnetic (slightly magnetic) or diamagnetic (tend to exclude magnetic ﬁelds). Of the two,
diamagnetic materials are the strangest. In the presence of an external magnetic ﬁeld, they
actually become slightly magnetized in the opposite direction, so as to repel the external ﬁeld!
