ETA-I currently provides a free practice exam at http://
www.eta-i.org/free_practice_exams.html (Figure 2-3). 
An online store for ISCET at http://store.nesda-iscet 
.org/stguprte.html provides a Computerized Associate 
Practice Test; the study material has a database of 300 
questions in 75-question tests. The tests can be taken 
over and over again. These organizations can change 
their offerings at any time, and this textbook reflects 
what was current at the time of printing.
