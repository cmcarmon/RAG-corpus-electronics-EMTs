You should understand that most forces, when applied to the gyro mounting, do not cause 
precession. For instance, you can swing the fork around in any direction, and the motion will merely be 
taken up in the Y-Y and Z-Z axes. Similarly, a force applied lengthwise along one of the axes will have 
no effect.
