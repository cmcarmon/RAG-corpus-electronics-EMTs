To  account  for  the  spreading  (or  divergence)  of  the  reﬂected  rays  because  of  the  earth’s  curvature,  we
introduce the divergence factor D. The curvature has a tendency to spread out the reﬂected energy more than
a  corresponding  ﬂat  surface.  The  divergence  factor  is  deﬁned  as  the  ratio  of  the  reﬂected  ﬁeld  from  curved
surface to the reﬂected ﬁeld from ﬂat surface [Kerr, 1951]. Using the geometry of Fig. 37.5, D is given by
