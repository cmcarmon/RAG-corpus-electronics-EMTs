As you should know from your study of transistor biasing, bias variations affect the operating point 
of the transistor. These variations may alter the amplification capabilities of the oscillator circuits as well. 
A well-regulated power supply and a bias-stabilizing circuit are required to ensure a constant, uniform 
signal output.
