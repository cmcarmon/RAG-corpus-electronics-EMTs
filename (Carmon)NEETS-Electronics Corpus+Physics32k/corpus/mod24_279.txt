Improved fabrication techniques provide the opportunity to experiment with material composition in
both multimode and single mode fibers. Fiber manufacturers fabricate optical fibers using glass material
whose characteristics improve system performance in the far infrared region. Fiber manufacturers add
dopant material to reduce fiber loss and limit material and structural imperfections. Fiber material used in
fabrication of low-loss, long wavelength optical fibers include the following:
