In some ways capacitance and inductance can be thought of as opposites. As stated before, as
frequency increases, capacitive reactance decreases, and inductive reactance increases. Capacitance
opposes changes in voltage, and inductance opposes changes in current. Capacitance causes current to
lead voltage, and inductance causes voltage to lead current.
