Characters are stored on a single track as strings of magnetized bits (0's and 1's) as shown in figure 
2-8. The 1 bits indicate magnetized spots or ON bits. The 0 bits represent unmagnetized portions of the 
track or OFF bits. Although the tracks get smaller as they get closer to the center of the disk platter, each 
track can hold the same amount of data because the data density is greater on tracks near the center.
