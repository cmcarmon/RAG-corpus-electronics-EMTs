Finally, conductors have Ô¨Ånite resistances that depend on
the temperature, the frequency of the current, the conductor
material, and other such factors. For most systems analysis
problems, these can be based on values provided by manufac-
turers or from tables for commonly used conductors and
typical ambient conditions.
