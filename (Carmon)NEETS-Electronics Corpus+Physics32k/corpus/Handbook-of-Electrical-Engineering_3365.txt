Similar  to  the  Mach–Zehnder,  the  ﬁrst  3-dB  coupler  splits  the  incident  signal  into  two  signals,  ideally  of
equal intensity. Once again, if a differential phase shift is electro-optically induced between these signals, then
when they recombine in the second 3-dB coupler, the ratio of power in the two outputs will be altered. Contrast
ratios greater than 20 dB (100:1) are routinely achieved in commercial devices. The transfer function for this
switch can be expressed as
