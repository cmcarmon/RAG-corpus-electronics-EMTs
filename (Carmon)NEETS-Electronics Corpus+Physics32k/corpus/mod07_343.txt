If the voltage level on the emitter is less positive than the voltage gradient opposite the emitter, the 
UJT is reverse biased. No current will flow from base 1 to the emitter. However, a small current, called 
reverse current, will flow from the emitter to base 2. The reverse current is caused by the impurities used 
in the construction of the UJT and is in the form of minority carriers.
