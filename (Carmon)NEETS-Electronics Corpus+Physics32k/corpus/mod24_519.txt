movable detector. Figure 5-8 shows an example setup for measuring the near-field power distribution.
The image is scanned in a plane by the movable detector. The image may also be scanned by using a
detector array. Detector arrays of known element size and spacing may provide a display of the power
distribution on a video monitor. A record of the near-field power is kept as a function of scan position.
