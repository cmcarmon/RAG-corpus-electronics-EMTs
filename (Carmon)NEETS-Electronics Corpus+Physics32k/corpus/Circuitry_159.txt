Figure  3.29        C–R circuits  are  widely  used  in  
electronics.  In  this  oscilloscope,  for  example,  a 
rotary  switch  is  used  to  select  different  C–R
combinations  in  order  to  provide  the  various 
timebase  ranges  (adjustable  from  500  ms/cm  to  
1 µs/cm).  Each C–R time constant corresponds to a 
different timebase range.
