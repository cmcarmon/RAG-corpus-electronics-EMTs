Semiconductor detectors are designed so that optical energy (photons) incident on the detector active
area produces a current. This current is called a photocurrent. The particular properties of the
semiconductor are determined by the materials used and the layering of the materials within the device.
Silicon (Si), gallium arsenide (GaAs), germanium (Ge), and indium phosphide (InP) are the most
common semiconductor materials used in optical detectors. In some cases aluminum (Al) and indium (In)
are used as dopants in the base semiconductor material.
