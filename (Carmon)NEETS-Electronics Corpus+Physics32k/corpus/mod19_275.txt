The frequency ratio between two sine waves can also be determined from lissajous patterns. Figure 
1-39 shows various frequency ratios between signals. Figure 1-40 and 1-41, views A, show how phase 
relationship can affect these patterns. If tangent lines are drawn across the top and down the side of the 
pattern, the ratio of points (free ends and loops) that touch these lines equals the frequency ratio. Figure 1-
41 is an example of this method. Refer back to figure 1-39 and notice the relationship of loops and open 
ends in each example. You can find more detailed information on lissajous patterns in the Electronics 
Installation and Maintenance Book (EIMB), Test Methods and Practices, NAVSEA 0976-LP-000-0130.
