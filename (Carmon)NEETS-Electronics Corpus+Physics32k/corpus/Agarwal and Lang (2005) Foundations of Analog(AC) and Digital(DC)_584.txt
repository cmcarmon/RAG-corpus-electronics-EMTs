Given the analytical expression for the characteristic of a nonlinear device,
such as that for the diode in Equation 4.1, how can we calculate the voltages
and currents in a simple circuit such as Figure 4.9? In the following sections we
will discuss four methods for solving such nonlinear circuits:
