  J-K  bistables  are  the  most  sophisticated  and 
flexible  of  the  bistable  types  and  they  can  be 
configured 
including  binary 
dividers, shift registers, and latches.  
  Figure  10.22  shows  the  arrangement  of  a  four-
stage  binary  counter  based  on  J-K  bistables.  The 
timing  diagram  for  this  circuit  is  shown  in  Fig. 
10.23.  Each  stage  successively  divides  the  clock 
input signal by a factor of two. Note that a logic 1 
input  is  transferred  to  the  respective  Q-output  on 
the falling edge of the clock pulse and all J and K 
inputs  must  be  taken  to  logic  1  to  enable  binary 
counting.
