The motion of a particle under a central force F always remains in the plane defined by its initial position and velocity. This may be seen by symmetry. Since the position r, velocity v and force F all lie in the same plane, there is never an acceleration perpendicular to that plane, because that would break the symmetry between "above" the plane and "below" the plane.
To demonstrate this mathematically, it suffices to show that the angular momentum of the particle is constant. This angular momentum L is defined by the equation





L

=

r

×

p

=

r

×
m

v



{\displaystyle \mathbf {L} =\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {p} =\mathbf {r} \times m\mathbf {v} }

where m is the mass of the particle and p is its linear momentum. Therefore, the angular momentum vector L is always perpendicular to the plane defined by the particle's position vector r and velocity vector v.
In general, the rate of change of the angular momentum L equals the net torque r × F

The first term m v × v is always zero, because the vector cross product is always zero for any two vectors pointing in the same or opposite directions. However, when F is a central force, the remaining term r × F is also zero because the vectors r and F point in the same or opposite directions. Therefore, the angular momentum vector L is constant. Then

{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} \cdot \mathbf {L} =\mathbf {r} \cdot (\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {p} )=\mathbf {p} \cdot (\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {r} )=0}

Consequently, the particle's position r (and hence velocity v) always lies in a plane perpendicular to L.
