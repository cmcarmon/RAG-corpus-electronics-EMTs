The procedure for measuring multimode and single mode fiber geometry is detailed in EIA/TIA-455-
176. The fiber-geometrical parameters measured include cladding diameter, cladding noncircularity, core-
cladding concentricity error, and core noncircularity. Figure 4-8 (chapter 4) illustrates core noncircularity
