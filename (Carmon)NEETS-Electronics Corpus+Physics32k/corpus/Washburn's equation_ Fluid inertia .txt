In the derivation of Washburn's equation, the inertia of the liquid is ignored as negligible. This is apparent in the dependence of length



L


{\displaystyle L}
to the square root of time,



L

t




{\displaystyle L\propto {\sqrt {t}}}
, which gives an arbitrarily large velocity dL/dt for small values of t. An improved version of Washburn's equation, called Bosanquet equation, takes the inertia of the liquid into account.
