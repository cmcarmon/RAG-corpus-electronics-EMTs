A typical Yagi array used for receiving and transmitting energy is shown with a support frame in 
figure 4-33. This antenna is used by the military services. It operates at frequencies of from 12 to 50 
megahertz and consists of two separate arrays (one high-frequency and one low-frequency antenna array) 
mounted on one frame. The various elements are indicated in the figure. The high-frequency (hf) array 
consists of one reflector, one driven element, and two directors; the low-frequency (lf) array has the same 
arrangement with one less director. The lengths of the elements in the high-frequency array are shorter 
than those in the low-frequency array. The physical lengths of the elements in the individual arrays are 
equal, but the electrical lengths can be varied by means of the tuning stubs at the center of the elements. 
The array can be rotated in any desired direction by a remotely controlled, electrically driven, antenna 
rotator.
