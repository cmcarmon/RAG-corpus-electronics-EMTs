Shock waves can be:
Normal: at 90Â° (perpendicular) to the shock medium's flow direction.
Oblique: at an angle to the direction of flow.
Bow: Occurs upstream of the front (bow) of a blunt object when the upstream flow velocity exceeds Mach 1.
Some other terms
Shock Front: The boundary over which the physical conditions undergo an abrupt change because of a shock wave.
Contact Front: in a shock wave caused by a driver gas (for example the "impact" of a high explosive on the surrounding air), the boundary between the driver (explosive products) and the driven (air) gases. The Contact Front trails the Shock Front.
