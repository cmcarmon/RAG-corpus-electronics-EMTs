The  mechanism  responsible  for  controlling  the  conductivity  from  collector  to 
emitter lies in the depletion layers formed at base-emitter and base-collector PN-junctions 
shown in Figure 7.4. When the base-emitter PN-junctions is reverse biased, electrons from 
the  emitter  are  unable  to  get  across  the  potential  barrier  of  the  PN-junction.  When  the 
base-emitter diode is forward biased, electrons from the emitter are injected into the base. 
Since the base is very thin, the electrons can easily diffuse across and be “swept up” by 
the electric field in the reverse-biased depletion layer of the base-collector junction. This 
electron diffusion current from the emitter to the collector is the large output current of a 
BJT.
