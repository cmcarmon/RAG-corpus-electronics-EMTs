Net migration has a major key role in every single country. Like mentioned before if a country has a high migration rate is it seen as wealthy and developed. In contrast a country with a low rate is seen as undeveloped, having political problems, and lacking resources its citizens need. Every country needs a stable number of people going in and out of their territory in order to have a stable economy. If the number of people coming in is greater than the number of people leaving, there will be a greater demand of resources and a tighter yet growing economy. On the other hand, a country with a lower migration rate will most likely lose many of its available resources due to a lack of consumerism and production. Other occurring problems caused by net migration is a rise in the dependency ratio, higher demand on government resources, and public congestion.
