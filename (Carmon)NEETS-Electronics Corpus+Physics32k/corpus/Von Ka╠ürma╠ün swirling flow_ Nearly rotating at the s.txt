Since both boundary conditions for



G


{\displaystyle G}
are almost equal to one, one would expect the solution to slightly deviate from one. With this the scales for



F


{\displaystyle F}
and



H


{\displaystyle H}
can be derived from the self-similar equations. Therefore,

These solution are similar to an Ekman layer solution.
