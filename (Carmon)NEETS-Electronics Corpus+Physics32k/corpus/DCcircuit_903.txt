The most common solution to this measurement problem is to use an ampliﬁed meter with
an extremely high internal resistance to measure the electrode voltage, so as to draw as little
current through the circuit as possible. With modern semiconductor components, a voltmeter
with an input resistance of up to 1017 Ω can be built with little difﬁculty. Another approach,
seldom seen in contemporary use, is to use a potentiometric ”null-balance” voltage measure-
ment setup to measure this voltage without drawing any current from the circuit under test.
If a technician desired to check the voltage output between a pair of pH electrodes, this would
probably be the most practical means of doing so using only standard benchtop metering equip-
