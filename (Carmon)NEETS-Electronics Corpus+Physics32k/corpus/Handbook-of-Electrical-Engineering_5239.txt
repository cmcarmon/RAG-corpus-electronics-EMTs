The  rotor  winding  is  supplied  by  dc  current,  either  directly  by  a  brushless  excitation  system  or  through
collector  rings.  The  rotor  is  supported  by  bearings  at  both  ends.  The  non-drive-end  bearing  is  insulated  to
avoid  shaft  current  generated  by  stray  magnetic  Ô¨Åelds.  The  hydrogen  is  cooled  by  a  hydrogen-to-water  heat
exchanger mounted on the generator or installed in a closed-loop cooling system.
