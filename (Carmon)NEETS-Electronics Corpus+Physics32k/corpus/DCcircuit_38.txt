The process of electrons arriving or leaving is exactly what happens when certain combina-
tions of materials are rubbed together: electrons from the atoms of one material are forced by
the rubbing to leave their respective atoms and transfer over to the atoms of the other material.
In other words, electrons comprise the ”ﬂuid” hypothesized by Benjamin Franklin.
