ELECTROSTATIC DEFLECTION uses principles you are already familiar with. Namely,
opposites attract, and likes repel. Look at figure 2-24, view A. Here you see an electron traveling between
two charged plates, H1 and H2. As you can see, before the electron reaches the charged plates, called
DEFLECTION PLATES, its flight path is toward the center of the screen. In view B, the electron has
reached the area of the deflection plates and is attracted toward the positive plate, H2, while being
repelled from the negative plate, H1. As a result, the electron is deflected to the right on the inside of the
screen. You, the viewer, will see the spot of light on the left side of the CRT face (remember, you are on
the opposite side of the CRT screen). This is shown in view C.
