The FRW/CFT duality is a conjectured duality for Friedmann-Robertson-Walker models inspired by the AdS/CFT correspondence. It assumes that the cosmological constant is exactly zero, which is only the case for models with exact unbroken supersymmetry. Because the energy density does not approach zero as we approach spatial infinity, the metric is not asymptotically flat. This is not an asymptotically cold solution.
