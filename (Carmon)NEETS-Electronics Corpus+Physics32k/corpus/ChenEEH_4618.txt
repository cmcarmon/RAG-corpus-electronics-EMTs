To obtain a sophisticated understanding for the speed limit of
the developed online fault accommodation technique under the
realtime control system with currently available microproces-
sors, an experimental online real-time fault-tolerant control test
bed is currently under construction for examining the proposed
control framework in real hardware. The major attention of the
future research work is also focused on testing the online fault
accommodation control framework in general MIMO cases
where the control problems are both theoretically and techni-
cally complicated since the searching of effective control signals
to accommodate the multiple failures becomes a multiobjective
optimization problem, which is still one of the remaining open
research issues. Thus, how to systematically reorganize the
priorities of the control missions related to both system stability
and performance for the general MIMO system under multiple
failures in the online situation becomes challenging work.
