The transmitter output interface may consist of a fiber optical connector. The optical source may
couple to the output optical connector through an intermediate optical fiber. One end of the optical fiber is
attached to the source. The other end terminates in the transmitter optical output connector. The optical
source may also couple to the output optical connector without an intermediate optical fiber. The optical
source is placed within the transmitter package to launch power directly into the fiber of the mating
optical connector. In some cases lenses are used to more efficiently couple light from the source into the
mating optical connector.
