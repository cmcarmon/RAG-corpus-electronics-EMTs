1.4.2 Communicating Information with Signals
The basic idea of communication engineering is to use a signal’s parameters to represent either real numbers or
other signals. The technical term is to modulate the carrier signal’s parameters to transmit information
from one place to another. To explore the notion of modulation, we can send a real number (today’s
temperature, for example) by changing a sinusoid’s amplitude accordingly. If we wanted to send the daily
