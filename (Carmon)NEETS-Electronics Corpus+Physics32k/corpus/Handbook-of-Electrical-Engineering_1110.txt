where x(n) is the input sequence, y(n) is the output sequence, and h(n) is the impulse response of the ﬁlter. The
ﬁlter  is  often  conveniently  described  in  terms  of  its  frequency  characteristics  that  are  given  by  the  transfer
function H( e jw). The impulse response and transfer function are a Fourier transform pair:
