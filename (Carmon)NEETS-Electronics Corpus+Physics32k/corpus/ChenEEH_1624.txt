Multimedia data, such as text, audio, images and video, are
rapidly evolving as main avenues for the creation, exchange,
and storage of information in the modern era. Primarily, this
evolution is attributed to rapid advances in the three major
technologies that determine the data’s growth: VLSI technol-
ogy that is producing greater processing power, broadband
networks (e.g., ISDN, ATM, etc.) that are providing much
higher bandwidth for many practical applications, and multi-
media compression standards (e.g., JPEG, H.263, MPEG, MP3,
etc.) that enable efﬁcient storage and communication. The
combination of these three advances is spurring the creation
and processing of increasingly high-volume multimedia data,
along with efﬁcient compression and transmission over high-
bandwidth networks. This current trend toward the removal of
any conceivable bottleneck for those using multimedia data,
from advanced research organizations to home users, has led
to the explosive growth of visual information available in the
form of digital
libraries and online multimedia archives.
According to a press release by Google Inc. in December 2001,
the search engine offers access to over 3 billion Web documents
and its Image search comprises more that 330 million images.
Alta Vista Inc. has been serving around 25 million search quer-
ies per day in more than 25 languages, with its multimedia
search featuring over 45 million images, videos, and audio clips.
