At least two sets of terms are used to describe the four notes of a gatra:Ki Sindusawarno's system: (1) ding kecil (2) dong kecil (3) ding besar (4) dong besarMartopangrawit's system: (1) maju ('forward') (2) mundur ('back') (3) maju (4) seleh
The first word in the names is Ki Sindusawarno's system are similar to the names of the hierarchy of pitches used in Balinese music: ding represents the secondary note of a pathet, and dong is similar to the Western idea of tonic. Kecil and besar mean "small" and "large," respectively, so clearly this articulates the hierarchical system explained in the introduction, with the largest and most significant beat at the end of the gatra, and a somewhat smaller one halfway through.
The reference for the names in Martopangrawit's system is to kosokan, the direction of bowing of the rebab. It also reflects the idea that the second beat is stronger than the first and third, since drawing a bow tends to produce a stronger sound than pushing it.
