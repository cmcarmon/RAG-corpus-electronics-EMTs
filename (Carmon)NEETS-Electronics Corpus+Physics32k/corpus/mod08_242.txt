across a coil to form a tuned circuit. In the same way, the secondary of T2 represents the output of this
circuit. A capacitor connected across the secondary of T2 would form a parallel LC network. This
network could act as the input-signal-developing impedance for the next stage, or the network could
represent some type of output device, such as a transmitting antenna.
