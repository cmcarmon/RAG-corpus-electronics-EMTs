When digitally transmitted, the characters are ﬁrst encoded
into a sequence of bits, called a bit stream or baseband signal.
Groups of n bits can be combined to form a ﬁnite symbol set
or word of M ¼ 2n for such symbols. A system using a symbol
set size of M is called an M-ary system. The value of n or M
represents an important initial choice in the design of any
digital communication system. For n ¼ 1, the system is re-
ferred to as binary, the size of symbol set is M ¼ 2, and the
modulator uses two different waveforms to represent the
binary 1 and the binary 0. In this case, the symbol rate and
the bit rate are the same. For n ¼ 2, the system is called
quaternary or 4-ary (M ¼ 4). At each symbol time, the
modulator uses one of the four different waveforms to repre-
sent the symbol (see Figure 2.2).
