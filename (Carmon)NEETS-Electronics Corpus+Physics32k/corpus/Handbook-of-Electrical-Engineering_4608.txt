ferro-
 deals with the interaction of molecular magnetic dipoles with external and internal magnetic ﬁelds.
magnetism
Ferromagnetic  materials  retain  some  polarization  after  an  external  ﬁeld  is  removed—a  desirable  property  if
the application is a permanent magnet or a recording device—but one which causes losses in a transformer.
These materials have improved as the demands of magnetic recording have increased.
