where s11 and s12 are the elastic compliances that appear in the linear elasticity equation  xij =  sijkl Xkl , with  xij
the inÔ¨Ånitesimal strain components. Details on the different geometries and methods of measuring the piezore-
sistance effect can be found in the References. Equation (51.9) could be written in terms of the strain conjugate
xo as follows
