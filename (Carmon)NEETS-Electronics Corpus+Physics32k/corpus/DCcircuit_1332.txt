An easy way to create a magnetic ﬁeld of changing intensity is to move a permanent magnet
next to a wire or coil of wire. Remember: the magnetic ﬁeld must increase or decrease in
intensity perpendicular to the wire (so that the lines of ﬂux ”cut across” the conductor), or else
no voltage will be induced:
