(a) Let the stator windings carry balanced two-
phase currents given by ia = Ia cos ωt and
ib = Ia sin ωt, and let the rotor winding be
excited by a constant direct current If. Let the
rotor revolve at synchronous speed so that its
instantaneous angular position θ is given by
θ = ωt + δ. Derive an expression for the
