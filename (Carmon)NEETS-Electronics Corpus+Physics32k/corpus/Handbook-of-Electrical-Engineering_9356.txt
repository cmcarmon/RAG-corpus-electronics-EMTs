Display Technologies
Displays  are,  for  the  most  part,  characterized  by  their  responsiveness  to  a  changing  image. As  with  the  hard
copy  technologies,  display  technologies  vary  greatly  with  respect  to  performance  and  cost.  Guidelines  for
comparisons are based on the following characteristics: power consumption, screen size, depth, weight, rug-
gedness, brightness, addressability, contrast, intensity levels per dot, viewing angle, color capability, and relative cost.
