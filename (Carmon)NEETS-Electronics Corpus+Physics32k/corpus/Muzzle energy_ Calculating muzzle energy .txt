In the SI system the above Ek will be in unit joule if the mass, m, is in kilogram, and the speed, v, is in metre per second.
In United States engineering units, particular care must be taken to ensure that consistent units are used.

Mass, m, is usually given in grains and the speed, v, in feet per second but kinetic energy, Ek, is typically given in foot-pound force (abbreviated ft-lbf). Most sporting arms publications within the United States report muzzle energies in foot-pound force. If m is specified in grains and v in feet per second, the following formula can be used, which gives the energy in foot-pound force:

{\displaystyle E_{k}={\begin{matrix}{\frac {1}{2}}\end{matrix}}mv^{2}\times \left({\frac {1{\mbox{ ft}}\cdot {\mbox{lbf}}}{7000{\mbox{ gr}}\times 32.1739{\mbox{ ft}}{\mbox{/s}}^{2}}}\right)}


When publishing kinetic energy tables for small arms ammunition, an acceleration due to gravity of 32.163 ft/s2 rather than the standard of 32.1739 ft/s2 is used. The formula therefore becomes

The bullet energy, remaining energy, down range energy, and impact energy of a projectile may also be calculated using the above formulas.
The first of the two US formulas can be simplified in conformance with US practice to:

E = (M x V²) ÷ K

where K = 450,435 and is derived from (2 x 32.1739 x 7000),
M is the weight of the projectile, in grains,
V is the velocity in feet per second and
E is the energy in foot pounds.

Finally, there is one other formula that was published in Handloader's Digest Bullet & Powder Update (Follett Publishing, 1980). On page 41, author Dean Grennell states bullet energy can be derived by first squaring the velocity (ft./sec.), then dividing that result by the constant 450240 and finally, multiplying that result by the weight of the bullet, expressed in grains. The end result will be the bullet energy at that speed, expressed in foot-pounds (ft.•lbs.). The nice thing about this formula is that you can also determine down range energy of your bullet, quickly and easily. More simply, the formula could be expressed (using the above definitions): E = (V^2/450240)M
