Any molecule has a well-defined magnitude of magnetic moment, which may depend on the molecule's energy state. Typically, the overall magnetic moment of a molecule is a combination of the following contributions, in the order of their typical strength:
magnetic moments due to its unpaired electron spins (paramagnetic contribution), if any
orbital motion of its electrons, which in the ground state is often proportional to the external magnetic field (diamagnetic contribution)
the combined magnetic moment of its nuclear spins, which depends on the nuclear spin configuration.
