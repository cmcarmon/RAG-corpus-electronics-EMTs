Insofar as a load which has no magnetic or controlled source coupling to a one-port is concerned, the network
containing linear elements and both independent and controlled sources may be replaced by an ideal current
^
IN is the
source of strength,
^
ISC, which results when the terminals of the network are shorted and ZN is the driving
short-circuit current,
point impedance at the terminals when all independent sources are set equal to zero.
