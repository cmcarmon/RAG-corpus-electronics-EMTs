This simple circuit structure is associated with a well-established design theory and might appear the perfect
solution to the ﬁlter synthesis problem. Unfortunately, the problems introduced by the use of the inductor as
a circuit component proved a serious difﬁculty from the outset. Inductors are intrinsically nonideal components,
and the lower the frequency range of operation, the greater these problems become. Problems include signiﬁcant
series resistance associated with the physical structure of the inductor as a coil of wire, its ability to couple by
electromagnetic induction into ﬁelds emanating from external components and sources and from other induc-
tors within the ﬁlter, its physical size, and potential mechanical instability. Added to these problems is the fact
that the inductor tends not to be an off-the-shelf component but has instead to be fabricated to the required
value  as  a  custom  device.  These  serious  practical  difﬁculties  created  an  early  pressure  to  develop  alternative
approaches to electrical ﬁltering. After the emergence of the electronic ampliﬁer based on vacuum rules, it was
—were  capable  of
discovered  that  networks  involving  resistors,  capacitors,  and  ampliﬁers—
producing TFs exactly equivalent to those of LCR ladders. Figure 29.2 shows a single-ampliﬁer multiloop ladder
structure that can produce a ﬁfth-order response identical to that of the circuit of Fig. 29.1(a).
