The amount of downforce created by the wings or spoilers on a car is dependent primarily on two things:
The shape, including surface area, aspect ratio and cross-section of the device, and
The device's orientation (or angle of attack).
A larger surface area creates greater downforce and greater drag (also known as air resistance). The aspect ratio is the width of the airfoil divided by its depth. The aspect ratio formula is written like AR=b squared/s, where AR=aspect ratio, b=spand squared, and s=wing area. Also, a greater angle of attack (or tilt) of the wing or spoiler, creates more downforce, which puts more pressure on the rear wheels and more drag.
