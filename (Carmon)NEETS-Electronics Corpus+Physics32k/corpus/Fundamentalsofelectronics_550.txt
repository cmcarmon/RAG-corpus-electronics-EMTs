The frequency 1
, known today as the Nyquist frequency and the Shannon sampling frequency,
2Ts
corresponds to the highest frequency at which a signal can contain energy and remain compatible with
the Sampling Theorem. High-quality sampling systems ensure that no aliasing occurs by unceremoniously
lowpass ﬁltering the signal (cutoﬀ frequency being slightly lower than the Nyquist frequency) before sampling.
Such systems therefore vary the anti-aliasing ﬁlter’s cutoﬀ frequency as the sampling rate varies. Because
such quality features cost money, many sound cards do not have anti-aliasing ﬁlters or, for that matter,
