ical of audio, video, bandpass, and operational ampliﬁers. The input and output resistances
should be generalized to impedances Zi(ω) and Zo(ω) when frequency effects are important.
However, most commercial ampliﬁers are designed to make Zi and Zo real and constant over
the useful frequency range of the ampliﬁer block. If the frequency response of a block it-
self is known, the frequency response of a larger circuit containing the ampliﬁer block can
be found.
