Card-to-System Solutions
Naturally, communication with a smart card would be impossible without several software layers that transform
the request of the user into a sequence of bits transmitted to the device. At the lowest level, the drivers provide
the basic functionality by transferring a sequence of bytes to the reader. Then layers of software are built over
the driver to form application program interfaces (APIs). API offers to the application developer functions that
combine basic operations to hide speciÔ¨Åcity of a particular device and to ease the development.
