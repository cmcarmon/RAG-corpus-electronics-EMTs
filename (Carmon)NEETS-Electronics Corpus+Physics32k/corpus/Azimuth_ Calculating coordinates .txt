When the coordinates (X1, Y1) of one point, the distance L, and the azimuth α to another point (X2, Y2) are known, one can calculate its coordinates:









X

2





=

X

1


+
L
sin
⁡
α





Y

2





=

Y

1


+
L
cos
⁡
α






{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}X_{2}&=X_{1}+L\sin \alpha \\Y_{2}&=Y_{1}+L\cos \alpha \end{aligned}}}

This is typically used in triangulation.
