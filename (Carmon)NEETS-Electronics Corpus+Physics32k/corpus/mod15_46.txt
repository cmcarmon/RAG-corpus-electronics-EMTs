In addition to the two general classifications, synchros are grouped into seven basic functional 
classes as shown in table 1-1. Four of these are the torque type and three are the control type. Each 
synchro is described in the table by name, abbreviation, input, output, and the other synchro units that 
may be connected to it. Generally, torque and control synchros may not be interchanged. The functional 
operation of each of these seven synchros is covered later in this text.
