base region is, however, made very narrow so that 
carriers are swept across it from emitter to collector 
and  only  a  relatively  small  current  flows  in  the 
base. To put this into context, the current flowing in 
the  emitter  circuit  is  typically  100  times  greater 
than  that  flowing  in  the  base.  The  direction  of 
conventional  current  flow 
is  from  emitter  to 
collector  in  the  case  of  a  PNP  transistor,  and 
collector to emitter in the case of an NPN device. 
The  equation  that  relates  current  flow  in  the 
collector, base, and emitter currents is: 
 
IE = IB + IC
where  IE is  the  emitter  current,  IB is  the  base 
current, and IC is the collector current (all expressed 
in the same units).
