Real-time trafÔ¨Åc requires strong bounds on packet delay and
jitter, and the current Internet cannot provide any such
bounds. Packet delay and jitter effects are contributed at dif-
ferent stages of packet transmission, and different techniques
are used to reduce them. An analysis of these different com-
ponents is essential in understanding the overall cause because
almost all enhancements to the current Internet architecture
aim to reduce one of these components. We explain each of
these components (Bertsekas and Gallager, 1987) in more
detail in the following subsection.
