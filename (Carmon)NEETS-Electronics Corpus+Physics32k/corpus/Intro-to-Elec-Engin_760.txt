8.3.13 Develop a formula for the power gain AP for a
common-collector stage if the power gain of an
ampliﬁer stage is deﬁned as the ratio of the load
power vLiL to the power delivered by the stage v1is.
(See Figure 8.3.2 for notation.)
8.3.14 In the CC ampliﬁer stage of Figure 8.3.2(a), let R1
= 32 k, R2 = 22 k, RE = 400 , RL = 250 ,
and VCC = 9 V. Given that VA = 70 V, β = 50, and
ICQ = 4 mA for the BJT, ﬁnd Ri, Rin, Av1, and Ai.
*8.3.15 Obtain an expression for the power gain AP for
a common-base stage if the power gain of an
ampliﬁer stage is deﬁned as the ratio of the load
power vLiL to the power delivered by the source
v1is. (See Figure 8.3.3 for notation.)
