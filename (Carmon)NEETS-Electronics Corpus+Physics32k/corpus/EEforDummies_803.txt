Be sure to dispose of batteries properly. Batteries containing heavy metals 
(such as nickel, cadmium, lead, and mercury) can be hazardous to the envi-
ronment when improperly disposed. For guidelines on proper disposal — 
which may vary from state to state — check battery manufacturer websites 
or other websites, such as www.ehso.com/ehshome/batteries.php.
