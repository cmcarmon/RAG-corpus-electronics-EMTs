The storage life of a mercury cell varies but is generally classified as long. The working life of the
cell is extremely long relative to other types of batteries; and it maintains its full rated voltage (1.34 volts)
until just before it is ready to expire, at which point its voltage will drop off sharply. Recharging of
mercury cells is possible, but is not recommended because the recharging cycle can vary from one cell to
another; and, after being recharged, their operating lifetime is uncertain.
