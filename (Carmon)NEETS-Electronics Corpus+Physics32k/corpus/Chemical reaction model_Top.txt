Chemical reaction models transform physical knowledge into a mathematical formulation so that knowledge can be utilized in computational simulation of practical problems. The computers then provide the flexibility to visualize the phenomenon and their interactions to a wide range applications. Modeling of a chemical reaction involves solving conservation equations describing convection, diffusion, and reaction source for each component species.
