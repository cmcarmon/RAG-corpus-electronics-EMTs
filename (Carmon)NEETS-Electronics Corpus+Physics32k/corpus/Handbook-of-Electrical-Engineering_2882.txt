All SMDs undergo thermal shocking during the soldering process, particularly if the SMDs are to be wave-
soldered (Type II or Type III boards), which means they will be immersed in the molten solder wave for 2 to
4 s. Therefore, all plastic-packaged parts must be controlled for moisture content. If the parts have not been
stored in a low-humidity environment (<25%RH), then the absorbed moisture will expand during the solder
process and crack the package — a phenomenon know as “popcorning” because the crack is accompanied by
a loud “pop” and the package expands due to the expansion of moisture, just like real popcorn. IC suppliers
have strict recommendations on storage ambient humidity and temperature, and also on the baking procedures
