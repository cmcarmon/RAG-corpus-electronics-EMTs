Using an ohmmeter set to the R Â·  100 scale, measure the resistance between the drain and the
source; then reverse the ohmmeter leads and take another reading. Both readings should be the same (100
to 10,000 ohms), regardless of meter lead polarity. Next, connect the positive meter lead to the gate.
Using the negative lead, measure the resistance between the gate and the drain; then measure it between
the gate and the source. Both readings should show infinity. Disconnect the positive lead from the gate
and connect the negative lead to the gate. Using the positive lead, measure the resistance between the gate
and the drain; then measure it between the gate and the source. Both readings should indicate a low
resistance and be approximately equal.
