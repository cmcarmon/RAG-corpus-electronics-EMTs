labeled ‘‘1’’ through ‘‘4,’’
together with the waveform for the source in each circuit. The figure also shows four
branch-variable waveforms, labeled ‘‘a’’ through ‘‘d,’’ that could correspond to the branch
current i or branch voltages v labeled in the circuits. Match the branch variable waveforms
to the appropriate circuit and source waveform.
