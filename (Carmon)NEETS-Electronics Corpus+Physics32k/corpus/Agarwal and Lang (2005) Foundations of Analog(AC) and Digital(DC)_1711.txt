In this section, we will focus on undriven second-order capacitor-inductor
circuits to which we have added a single resistor. There are two ways in which
we can add a resistor to the circuit shown in Figure 12.6. We can either place
it in parallel or in series with the two original elements. The two resulting
circuits are shown in Figure 12.14. We will study the series RLC circuit in more
detail here, and in Section 12.4 will discuss the corresponding parallel circuit.
As we shall see shortly, the presence of the resistors in these circuits, and their
associated losses, changes the behavior of the original circuit significantly. Most
importantly, the energy stored in the circuit is no longer constant; rather, it
decays in time. As a consequence, the circuit states also decay in time.
