  The  value  of  monostable  timing  period  can  be 
calculated from the formula: 
 
ton = 1.1 C R
We need to choose an appropriate value for C that 
is  in  the  range  stated  earlier.  Since  we  require  a 
fairly long time period we will choose a relatively 
large value of C in order to avoid making the value 
of  R too  high.  A  value  of  100  µF  should  be 
appropriate  and  should  also  be  easy  to  obtain. 
Making  R the  subject  of 
the  formula  and 
substituting for C = 100 µF gives:
