Assume that a 240ยบ input is applied to the system, as indicated in view B, by turning the TX rotor to 
its 240ยบ position. At this position maximum voltage is induced into the S1 winding of the TX and coupled 
to S1 of the TDX. Since the TDX rotor is on 0ยบ, it passes this maximum voltage (via R1) along to the S1 
winding of the TR. The stator magnetic field in the receiver now lines up in the direction of the S1 
winding and causes the rotor to turn counterclockwise to the 240ยบ position. This illustrates an important 
point:
