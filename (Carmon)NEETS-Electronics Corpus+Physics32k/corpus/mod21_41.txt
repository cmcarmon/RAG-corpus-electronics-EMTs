No discussion of electronic test equipment or electronic measurements would be complete without
mentioning the Navy’s Metrology Calibration (METCAL) program. Figure 1-1 shows the METCAL
structure. Basically, the METCAL program is an elaborate quality control system designed to compare
your electronic test equipment with test equipment of much greater accuracy. When you submit your
piece of test equipment for calibration, it is compared with the calibration laboratory’s equipment
(referred to as STANDARDS), which are generally at least four times more accurate than yours. If your
equipment does not meet specifications, it is either repaired, adjusted, or rejected with an explanation of
why the calibration laboratory was unable to calibrate it. The accuracy of equipment at your local
calibration laboratory is ensured by calibration of the test equipment to the standards of the next higher
echelon calibration laboratory. The accuracies of test equipment at each higher echelon is increased by a
ratio of approximately 4 to 1.
