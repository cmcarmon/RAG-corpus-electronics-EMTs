The line consists of a dielectric substrate and a narrow slot
on one side of the substrate, the other side is without metal-
lization. In a slot line, the wave propagates along the slot with
major electric ﬁeld component oriented across the slot in the
plane of metallization. The mode of propagation is non-TEM
and almost transverse electric in nature. However, unlike the
conventional waveguide, there is no low frequency cutoff be-
cause the slotline is a two-conductor structure. The most
widely used method of slotline analysis is the one given by
Cohn and employs a transverse resonance approach. Most
methods used to ﬁnd the wavelength and impedance for this
type of waveguide are based on numerical formulation, and
they do not provide closed form expressions. This becomes a
serious handicap for circuit analysis and design. Closed form
expression has been obtained by curve-ﬁtting the results based
on Cohn’s analysis. These expressions have an accuracy of the
order of 2% for the following set of parameters:
