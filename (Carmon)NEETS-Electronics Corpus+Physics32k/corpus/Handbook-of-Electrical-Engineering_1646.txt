For example, the location of your car can be estimated using a Kalman ﬁlter to combine noisy measurements
of distance from four or more satellites. As a second example, the position and velocity of an airplane can be
estimated  by  a  Kalman  ﬁlter  using  noisy  measurements  of  range,  azimuth,  and  elevation  from  one  or  more
radars. As a third example, the future price of IBM stock can be predicted using a Kalman ﬁlter to combine
noisy data on thousands of relevant economic variables, using a dynamic model of the stock market and the
overall economy.
