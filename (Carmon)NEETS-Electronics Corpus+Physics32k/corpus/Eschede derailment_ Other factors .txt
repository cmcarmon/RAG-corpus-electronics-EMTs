The design of the overbridge may have also contributed to the accident because it had two thin piers holding up the bridge on either side, instead of the spans going from solid abutments to solid abutments. The Granville train disaster of 1977 had a similar weakness in its bridge. The bridge built after the disaster is a cantilevered design and does not have this vulnerability. However, though it is practical to mandate that new bridges should be designed to resist collapsing in the event of an impact, it would be of questionable practicability to mandate the replacement of all existing bridges which used the old design.
Another contributing factor to the casualty rate was the use of welds in the carriage bodies that "unzipped" during the crash.
In summary, though the disintegrated resilient wheel was the root cause of the accident, the damage was as severe as it was due to a number of factors, including the proximity to the bridge and flipping point, as well as the position of the wheel on the front-end train car, leading to a large number of cars derailing.
