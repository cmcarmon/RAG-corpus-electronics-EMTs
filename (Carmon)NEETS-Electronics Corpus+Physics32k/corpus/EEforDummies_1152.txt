Measuring current
To measure current, you connect your multimeter in a way that ensures 
that the same current you want to measure passes through the meter when 
the circuit is powered up. In other words, you must insert your multimeter 
in the circuit in series with the component you want to measure current 
through. This setup, as shown in Figure 16-9, is different from the voltmeter 
 configuration.
