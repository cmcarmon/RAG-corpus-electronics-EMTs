3. Observe from Fig. 8.9 that the waveforms of the responses differ.
In general, it is difﬁcult to tell from the waveforms the difference
between the overdamped and critically damped responses. The crit-
ically damped case is the borderline between the underdamped and
overdamped  cases  and  it  decays  the  fastest. With  the  same  initial
conditions,  the  overdamped  case  has  the  longest  settling  time,
because  it
takes  the  longest  time  to  dissipate  the  initial  stored
energy.  If  we  desire  the  response  that  approaches  the  ﬁnal  value
most  rapidly  without  oscillation  or  ringing,  the  critically  damped
circuit is the right choice.
