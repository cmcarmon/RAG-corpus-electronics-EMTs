Seldom is there a need to simulate an induction machine in the arbitrary rotating reference frame. Induction
machine loads are often simulated on the network’s synchronously rotating reference frame in power system
studies. However, in transient studies of adjustable speed drives, it is usually more convenient to simulate the
induction machine and its converter on a stationary reference frame. Equations of the machine in the stationary
and  synchronously  rotating  reference  frames  can  be  obtained  by  setting  the  speed  of  the  arbitrary  reference
frame, ω, to zero and ω
