In  reality,  c(t)  is  never  generated  in  the  transmitter.  Rather,  x(t)  is  obtained  by  applying  the  sequence  of
pseudorandom frequency shifts {fn} directly to the frequency synthesizer that generates the carrier frequency fc
(see Fig. 70.15). In terms of the actual implementation, successive (not necessarily disjoint) k-chip segments
of a PN sequence drive a frequency synthesizer, which hops the carrier over 2k frequencies. In view of the large
bandwidths over which the frequency synthesizer must operate, it is difÔ¨Åcult to maintain phase coherence from
hop to hop, which explains the inclusion of the sequence {fn} in the Eq. (70.5) model for c(t). On a short term
basis, e.g., within a given hop, the signal bandwidth is identical to that of the MFSK information modulation,
which  is  typically  much  smaller  than  Wss.  On  the  other  hand,  when  averaged  over  many  hops,  the  signal
bandwidth is equal to Wss, which can be on the order of several GHz, i.e., an order of magnitude larger than
that  of  implementable  DS  bandwidths.  The  exact  relation  between Wss, Th, Ts  and  the  number  of  frequency
shifts in the set {fn} will be discussed shortly.
