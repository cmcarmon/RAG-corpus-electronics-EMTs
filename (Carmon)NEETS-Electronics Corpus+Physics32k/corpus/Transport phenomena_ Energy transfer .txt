All processes in engineering involve the transfer of energy. Some examples are the heating and cooling of process streams, phase changes, distillations, etc. The basic principle is the first law of thermodynamics which is expressed as follows for a static system:




q
=
−
k



d
T


d
x





{\displaystyle q=-k{\frac {dT}{dx}}}

The net flux of energy through a system equals the conductivity times the rate of change of temperature with respect to position.
For other systems that involve either turbulent flow, complex geometries or difficult boundary conditions another equation would be easier to use:




Q
=
h
⋅
A
⋅

Δ
T



{\displaystyle Q=h\cdot A\cdot {\Delta T}}

where A is the surface area, :




Δ
T



{\displaystyle {\Delta T}}
is the temperature driving force, Q is the heat flow per unit time, and h is the heat transfer coefficient.
Within heat transfer, two types of convection can occur:
Forced convection can occur in both laminar and turbulent flow. In the situation of laminar flow in circular tubes, several dimensionless numbers are used such as Nusselt number, Reynolds number, and Prandtl. The commonly used equation is:




N

u

h

D

k




{\displaystyle Nu_{a}={\frac {h_{a}D}{k}}}

Natural or free convection is a function of Grashof and Prandtl numbers. The complexities of free convection heat transfer make it necessary to mainly use empirical relations from experimental data.
Heat transfer is analyzed in packed beds, reactors and heat exchangers.
