The counterpart, in aperture and sensor array processing, of the use of window functions in spectral analysis
for reduction of sidelobes is the use of aperture shading. In aperture shading, one simply multiplies a uniformly
weighted aperture by the shading function. The resulting beam pattern is, then, simply the convolution of the
beam pattern of the uniformly shaded volumetric array and the beam pattern of the shading function. Fourier
transform  relationship  between  the  stationary  signal s(x,t)  and  the  wavenumber  frequency  spectrum  S(k,w)
allows  one  to  exploit  high-resolution  spectral  analysis  techniques  for  the  high-resolution  estimation  of  the
direction of arrival [Pillai, 1989]. The superscript *, t, and H denote, respectively, complex conjugate, transpose,
and conjugate transpose.
