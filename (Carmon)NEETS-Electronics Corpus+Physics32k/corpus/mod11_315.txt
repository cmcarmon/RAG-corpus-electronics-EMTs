Sharply directive antennas can be constructed from two or more simple half-wave dipole elements. 
They must be positioned so that the fields from the elements add in some directions and cancel in others. 
Such a set of antenna elements is called an ANTENNA ARRAY. When a reflector is placed behind the 
dipole array, radiation occurs in one direction with a pattern similar to the one shown in figure 3-13.
