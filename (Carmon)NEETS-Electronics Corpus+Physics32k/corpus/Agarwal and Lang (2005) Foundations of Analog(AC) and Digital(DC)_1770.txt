The complexity of handling successive rising and falling transients is most easily managed
by modeling the driving inverter with its Th√©venin equivalent, which is summarized in
Figure 12.36. This in turn leads to a simpler model for the interconnection as shown in
Figure 12.37. Figure 12.36 shows that
