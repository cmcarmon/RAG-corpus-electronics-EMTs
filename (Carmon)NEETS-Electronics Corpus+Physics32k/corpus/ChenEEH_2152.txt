Example 1.6
In rare instances, the integral forms of Ampe`re’s law equation
1.29 and Gauss’s law equation 1.31 can be used to solve for H
and B. This occurs when the problem contains sufﬁcient sym-
metry so that H and B can be factored out of the integrals in
these two equations (Paul et al., 1998). As an example consider
the toroid shown in Table 1.2. Assuming that the wire (carry-
ing current I) is ‘‘tightly wound’’ on the toroid, then using
Ampere’s law around a circular contour inside the toroid gives:
