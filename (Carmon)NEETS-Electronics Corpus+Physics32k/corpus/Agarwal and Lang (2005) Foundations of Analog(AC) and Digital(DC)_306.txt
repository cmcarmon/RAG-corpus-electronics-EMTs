We will show that the mathematical grunge of the basic method can be eliminated using
the energy method and some intuition. In Figure 2.28, the current source maintains a
current i = 0.002 A through the circuit. To determine v, we equate the power supplied
by the source to the power dissipated by the resistor. Since the current source and the
resistor share terminals, the voltage v appears across the current source as well. Thus,
the power into the source is given by
