It is relatively easy to implement this suggested Bode diagram design procedure which is based upon considering
only these break frequencies immediately above and below crossover and which approximate all others. Break
frequencies far below crossover are approximated by integrations or differentiations, that is, poles or zeros at
s = 0, and break frequencies far above the crossover frequency are ignored.
