The Coulomb Hamiltonian has a continuous spectrum due to the center of mass (COM) motion of the molecule in homogeneous space. In classical mechanics it is easy to separate off the COM motion of a system of point masses. Classically the motion of the COM is uncoupled from the other motions. The COM moves uniformly (i.e., with constant velocity) through space as if it were a point particle with mass equal to the sum Mtot of the masses of all the particles.
In quantum mechanics a free particle has as state function a plane wave function, which is a non-square-integrable function of well-defined momentum. The kinetic energy of this particle can take any positive value. The position of the COM is uniformly probable everywhere, in agreement with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.
By introducing the coordinate vector X of the center of mass as three of the degrees of freedom of the system and eliminating the coordinate vector of one (arbitrary) particle, so that the number of degrees of freedom stays the same, one obtains by a linear transformation a new set of coordinates ti. These coordinates are linear combinations of the old coordinates of all particles (nuclei and electrons). By applying the chain rule one can show that

The first term of



H


{\displaystyle H}
is the kinetic energy of the COM motion, which can be treated separately since




H
′



{\displaystyle H'}
does not depend on X. As just stated, its eigenstates are plane waves. The potential V(t) consists of the Coulomb terms expressed in the new coordinates. The first term of




H
′



{\displaystyle H'}
has the usual appearance of a kinetic energy operator. The second term is known as the mass polarization term. The translationally invariant Hamiltonian




H
′



{\displaystyle H'}
can be shown to be self-adjoint and to be bounded from below. That is, its lowest eigenvalue is real and finite. Although




H
′



{\displaystyle H'}
is necessarily invariant under permutations of identical particles (since



H


{\displaystyle H}
and the COM kinetic energy are invariant), its invariance is not manifest.
Not many actual molecular applications of




H
′



{\displaystyle H'}
exist; see, however, the seminal work on the hydrogen molecule for an early application. In the great majority of computations of molecular wavefunctions the electronic problem is solved with the clamped nucleus Hamiltonian arising in the first step of the Born–Oppenheimer approximation.
See Ref. for a thorough discussion of the mathematical properties of the Coulomb Hamiltonian. Also it is discussed in this paper whether one can arrive a priori at the concept of a molecule (as a stable system of electrons and nuclei with a well-defined geometry) from the properties of the Coulomb Hamiltonian alone.
