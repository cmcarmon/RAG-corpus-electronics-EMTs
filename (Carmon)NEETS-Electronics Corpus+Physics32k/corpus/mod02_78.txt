 Inductance depends entirely upon the physical construction of the circuit, and can only be measured 
with special laboratory instruments. Of the factors mentioned, consider first how the number of turns 
affects the inductance of a coil. Figure 2-5 shows two coils. Coil (A) has two turns and coil (B) has four 
turns. In coil (A), the flux field set up by one loop cuts one other loop. In coil (B), the flux field set up by 
one loop cuts three other loops. Doubling the number of turns in the coil will produce a field twice as 
strong, if the same current is used. A field twice as strong, cutting twice the number of turns, will induce 
four times the voltage. Therefore, it can be said that the inductance varies as the square of the number of 
turns.
