Lever can be used to change the magnitude of a given mechanical signal, such as force or displacement. Levers are widely used as mechanical amplifiers in actuators and generators.
It is a mechanism that usually consist of a rigid beam/rod fixed about a pivot. Levers are balanced when there is a balance of moment or torque about the pivot. Three major classifications exist, depending on the position of the pivot, input and output forces. The fundamental principle of lever mechanism is governed by the following ratio, dating back to Archimedes.

a

{\displaystyle {\frac {F_{B}}{F_{A}}}={\frac {a}{b}}}

where FA is a force acting on point A on the rigid lever beam, FB is a force acting on point B on the rigid lever beam and a and b are the respective distances from points A and B to the pivot point.
If FB is the output force and FA is the input force, then mechanical advantage MA is given by the ratio of output force to input force.
