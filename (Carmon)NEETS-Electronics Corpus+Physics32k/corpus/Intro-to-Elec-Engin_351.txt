At zero power factor, corresponding to a purely reactive load, both wattmeters will again
have the same wattage indication but with the opposite signs, so that their algebraic sum will
yield zero power absorbed, as it should. The transition from a negative to a positive value occurs
when the load power factor is 0.5 (i.e., φ is equal to 60°). At this power factor, one wattmeter
reads zero while the other one reads the total real power delivered to the load.
