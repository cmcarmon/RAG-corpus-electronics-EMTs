The pulse-forming network, shown in view B of figure 2-5, can carry high voltage but does not
require bulky insulation on all of its capacitors. Only series capacitor C1 must have high-voltage
insulation. Because the other capacitors are in parallel with the corresponding inductors, the modulator-
pulse voltage divides nearly equally among them. Thus, except for C1, the elements of the pulse-forming
network are relatively small.
