An example of translational symmetry in one direction in 2D nr. 1) is:
Note: The example is not an example of rotational symmetry.

(get the same by moving one line down and two positions to the right), and of translational symmetry in two directions in 2D (wallpaper group p1):

* |* |* |* |

(get the same by moving three positions to the right, or one line down and two positions to the right; consequently get also the same moving three lines down).
In both cases there is neither mirror-image symmetry nor rotational symmetry.
For a given translation of space we can consider the corresponding translation of objects. The objects with at least the corresponding translational symmetry are the fixed points of the latter, not to be confused with fixed points of the translation of space, which are non-existent.
