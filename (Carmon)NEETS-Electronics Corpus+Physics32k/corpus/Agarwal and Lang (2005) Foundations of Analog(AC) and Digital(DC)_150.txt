VLSI stands for ‘‘Very Large Scale Integration.’’ Silicon-based VLSI is the technology
behind most of today’s computer chips. In this technology, lumped planar elements
such as wires, resistors, and a host of others that we will soon encounter, are fabricated
on the surface of a planar piece of silicon called a wafer (for example, see Figures 1.15
and 1.12). A wafer has roughly the shape and size of a Mexican tortilla or an Indian
chapati (see Figure 1.16). The planar elements are connected together using planar wires
to form circuits. After fabrication, each wafer is diced into several hundred chips or
‘‘dies,’’ typically, each the size of a thumbnail. A Pentium chip, for example, contains
hundreds of millions of planar elements (see Figure 1.17). Chips are attached, or bonded,
to packages (for example, see Figure 12.3.4), which are in turn mounted on a printed-
circuit board along with other discrete components such as resistors and capacitors (for
example, see Figure 1.18) and wired together.
