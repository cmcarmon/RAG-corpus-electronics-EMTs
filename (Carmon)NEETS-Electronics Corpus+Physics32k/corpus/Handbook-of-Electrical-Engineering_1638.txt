Bias: The norm of the difference between the true value of the estimate and its mean value.
Consistent estimator: An  estimator  whose  value  converges  to  the  true  parameter  value  as  the  sample  size
tends to inÔ¨Ånity. If the convergence holds w.p. 1, then the estimator is called strongly consistent or consistent
w.p. 1.
