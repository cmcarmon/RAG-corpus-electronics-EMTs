Those errors that cannot be predicted except on a statistical basis. The magnitude of the random error 
can be termed the precision and is an indication of the repeatability of a measurement.
A systematic error whether due to instrumentation or propagation conditions. A nonzero mean value of 
a random error.
An error whose quantity can be measured and reduced by calibration.
Those errors remaining after measurement and calibration. A function of
the systematic and random errors in the calibration process.
The magnitude of the rms value of the residual systematic and random errors.
