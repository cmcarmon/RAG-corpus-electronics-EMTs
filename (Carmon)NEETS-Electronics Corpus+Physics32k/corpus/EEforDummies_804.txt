Getting power from the sun
If you’re building a circuit designed to operate outside — or you just want to 
use a clean, green source of energy — you may want to purchase one or more 
solar panels. A solar panel consists of an array of solar cells (which are large 
diodes known as photodiodes) that generate current when exposed to a light 
source, such as the sun. (I discuss diodes in Chapter 9, and photodiodes in the 
section “Using Your Sensors,” later in this chapter.) A panel measuring about 
5 x 5 inches may be able to generate 100 milliamps at 5 volts in bright sunlight. 
If you need 10 amps, you can certainly get it, but you may find the size of the 
panel problematic — and expensive — for a small or portable project.
