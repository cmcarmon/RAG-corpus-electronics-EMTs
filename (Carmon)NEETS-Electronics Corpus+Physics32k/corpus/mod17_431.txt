When a message is transmitted by radio, the originator may know some of those who are receiving it, 
but will never know  all of those who are receiving the message. You must assume that an enemy receives 
every transmission. Property prepared messages using modern cryptographic systems may prevent an 
enemy from understanding a message. However, they can still learn a lot. For example, as time for a 
planned operation approaches, the number of messages transmitted increases. An enemy then knows that 
something will occur soon, and their forces are alerted. Strict radio silence is the main defense against 
radio intelligence.
