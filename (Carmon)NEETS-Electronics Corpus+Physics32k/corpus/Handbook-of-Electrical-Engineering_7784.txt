Like magnetic recording, a major application area for optical data storage systems is the secondary storage
of information for computers and computerized systems. Like the high-end magnetic media, optical disks can
provide recording densities in the range of 107 bits/cm2 and beyond. The added advantage of optical recording
is that, like ﬂoppies, these disks can be removed from the drive and stored on the shelf. Thus the functions of
the  hard  disk  (i.e.,  high  capacity,  high  data  transfer  rate,  rapid  access)  may  be  combined  with  those  of  the
ﬂoppy (i.e., backup storage, removable media) in a single optical disk drive. Applications of optical recording
are not conﬁned to computer data storage. The enormously successful audio compact disk (CD), which was
introduced in 1983 and has since become the de facto standard of the music industry, is but one example of
the tremendous potentials of the optical technology.
