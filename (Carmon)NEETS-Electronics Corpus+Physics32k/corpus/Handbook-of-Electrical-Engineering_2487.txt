The channel conductance in the region where VDS << VP is given
by gds = As/L = WHs/L, where the channel height H is given by H =
H0 – 2WD. In this equation WD is the depletion region width and H0
is the value of H as WD ﬁ  0. The depletion region width is given by
WD = K 
,  where  K  is  a  constant, VJ  is  the  junction
voltage, and f is the pn-junction contact potential (typically around
0.8 to 1.0 V). As VGS increases, WD increases and the channel height H decreases as given by H = H0 – 2K 
When  VGS = VP , the channel is completely pinched off, so H = 0 and thus 2K 
H0/
