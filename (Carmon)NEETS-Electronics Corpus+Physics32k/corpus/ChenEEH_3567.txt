The error introduced in the processing of digital signals due
to quantization depends on the format of the numbers, the
quantization method (truncation or rounding), the number
of bits used to represent signal values and ﬁlter coefﬁcients,
and so on. Details can be found in Mitra (1998) and Oppen-
heim et al. (1999).
