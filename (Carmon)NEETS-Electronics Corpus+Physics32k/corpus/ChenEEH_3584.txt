In particular, we focus on digital ﬁlters that implement
linear systems represented by difference equations. We will
show how to design digital ﬁlters based on magnitude speciﬁ-
cations. In addition, we present efﬁcient digital ﬁlter structures
that are often required for implementation with minimal cost,
taking into consideration that real-time implementation leads
to nonlinear distortions caused by the ﬁnite word length
representations of internal signals and coefﬁcients. Finally,
the mostly widely used approaches to implement a digital ﬁlter
are brieﬂy discussed.
