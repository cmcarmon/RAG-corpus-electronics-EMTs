The ecliptic poles are the two points where an imaginary line (the ecliptic axis) perpendicular to the ecliptic plane, on which Earth orbits the Sun, intersects the celestial sphere.
The two ecliptic poles are mapped below.
Due to axial precession, either celestial pole completes a circuit around the nearer ecliptic pole every 25,800 years.
As of 1 January 2000, the positions of the ecliptic poles expressed in equatorial coordinates, as a consequence of Earth's axial tilt, are the following:
North: right ascension 18h 0m 0.0s (exact), declination +66° 33′ 38.55″
South: right ascension 6h 0m 0.0s (exact), declination −66° 33′ 38.55″
It is impossible anywhere for either ecliptic pole to be at the zenith in the night sky. By definition, the ecliptic poles are located 90° from the Sun's position. Therefore, whenever and wherever either ecliptic pole is directly overhead, the Sun must be on the horizon. The ecliptic poles can contact the zenith only in the Arctic and Antarctic circles.
