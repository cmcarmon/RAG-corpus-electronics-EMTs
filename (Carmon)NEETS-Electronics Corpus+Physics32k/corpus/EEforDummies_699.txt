Over the years, digital circuit designers have 
perfected the design of adders and other 
commonly used digital circuits, figuring out 
clever ways to speed up the computation 
time, reduce power dissipation, and ensure 
that the results are accurate, even under harsh circuit conditions such as 
extreme temperatures. Tried‐and‐true digital circuit designs are commonly 
turned into standardized IC product offerings — so you and other circuit 
builders don’t have to re-create the wheel over and over again.
