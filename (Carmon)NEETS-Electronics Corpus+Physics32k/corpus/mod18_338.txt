During reception, the relatively weak field from the antenna enters arm 1 and divides at the junction
into two out-of-phase components. Neither field is sufficient to fire the tr tubes in arms 2 and 4; since the
fields arrive at these arms out of phase, energy is propagated to the receiver. The energy arriving at arm 3
is in phase and will not be coupled to the transmitter. Since the operation of the arms of a hybrid ring is
the same as the operation of E-type waveguide T-junctions, you may find it helpful to review NEETS,
Module 11, Microwave Principles.
