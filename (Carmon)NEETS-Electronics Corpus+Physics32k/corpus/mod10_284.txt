a.  The D layer ranges from about 30 to 55 miles. Ionization in the D layer is low because it is the 
lowest region of the ionosphere. This layer has the ability to refract signals of low frequencies. 
High frequencies pass right through it and are attenuated. After sunset, the D layer disappears 
because of the rapid recombination of ions.
