are given in Table 54.1.
A very wide range of materials exhibit ferroelectric, and thus pyroelectric, behavior. These range from crystals,
such as potassium dihydrogen phosphate and triglycine sulphate, to polymers, such as polyvinylidene ï¬‚uoride,
and liquid crystals such as DOBAMBC and ceramics, such as barium titanate and lead zirconate titanate.
