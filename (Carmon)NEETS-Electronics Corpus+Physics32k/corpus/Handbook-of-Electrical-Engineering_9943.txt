where x(t) is the n ·  1 state vector, u(t) is the plant input, y(t) is the plant output, A is the n ·  n system matrix,
B is the n ·  1 input matrix, and C is the 1 · n output matrix. The transfer function of (100.67) is an input-
output  model;  the  state  model  of  (100.68)  yields  the  same  input-output  model  and  in  addition  includes  an
internal model of the system. The state model of (100.68) is readily adaptable to a multiple-input–multiple-
output system (a multivariable system); for that case, u(t) and y(t) are vectors. We will consider only single-
input–single-output systems.
