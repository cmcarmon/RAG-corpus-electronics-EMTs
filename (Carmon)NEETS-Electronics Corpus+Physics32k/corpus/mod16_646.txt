The TRIGGER LEVEL (mounted with the TRIGGER SLOPE on some scopes) determines the
voltage level required to trigger the sweep. For example, in the TRIGGER modes, the trigger is obtained
from the signal to be displayed. The setting of the LEVEL control determines the amplitude point of the
input waveform that will be displayed at the start of the sweep.
