Two-hybrid screens are low-tech; they can be carried out in any lab without sophisticated equipment.
Two-hybrid screens can provide an important first hint for the identification of interaction partners.
The assay is scalable, which makes it possible to screen for interactions among many proteins. Furthermore, it can be automated, and by using robots many proteins can be screened against thousands of potentially interacting proteins in a relatively short time. Two types of large screens are used: the library approach and the matrix approach.
Yeast two-hybrid data can be of similar quality to data generated by the alternative approach of coaffinity purification followed by mass spectrometry (AP/MS).
