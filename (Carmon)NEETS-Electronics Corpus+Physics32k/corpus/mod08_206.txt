If a coil is placed in parallel (shunt) with the output signal path, the technique is called SHUNT
PEAKING. Figure 2-7 shows a circuit with a shunt peaking coil. With the exceptions of the "phantom"
capacitor and the inductor, the components in this circuit are the same as those in figure 2-6. R1 is the
input-signal-developing resistor. R2 is used for bias and temperature stability. C1 is the bypass capacitor
for R2. R3 is the load resistor for Q1 and develops the output signal. C2 is the coupling capacitor which
couples the output signal to the next stage.
