For example, in figure 3-37, view (A) and view (B) if trigger pulses are applied every 200 
microseconds (5 kilohertz), the trigger that appears at T1 is not of sufficient amplitude to overcome the 
cutoff bias and turn on Q1. At T2, capacitor C1 has nearly discharged and the trigger causes Q1 to 
conduct. Note that with a 200-microsecond input trigger, the output prt is 400 microseconds. The output 
frequency is one-half the input trigger frequency and the blocking oscillator becomes a frequency divider.
