Next, touch the positive (red) multimeter lead to the unconnected resistor 
lead and the negative (black) multimeter lead to the unconnected LED lead, 
as shown in Figure 3-14. The LED should turn on, because the multimeter has 
completed the circuit, allowing current to run through it. The current reading 
I got was 2.14 mA.
