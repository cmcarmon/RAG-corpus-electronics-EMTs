To figure out which package lead is which, consult the documentation for 
the specific transistor. Be careful how you interpret the documentation: 
Transistor connections are often (though not always) shown from the under-
side of the case, as if youâ€™ve turned the transistor over and are gazing at it 
from the bottom.
