The critical temperatures for a few common substances are shown here in this table. Tem-
peratures are given in kelvins, which has the same incremental span as degrees Celsius (an
increase or decrease of 1 kelvin is the same amount of temperature change as 1o Celsius), only
offset so that 0 K is absolute zero. This way, we don’t have to deal with a lot of negative ﬁgures.
