The speech spectrum can be viewed as the product of a source spectrum and the transfer function of a linear,
time-varying  ﬁlter  which  represents  the  changing  conﬁguration  of  the  vocal  tract.  The  transfer  function
determines the shape, or envelope, of the spectrum, which carries phonetic information in speech. When excited
by  a  voicing  source,  the  formants,  or  natural  resonant  frequencies  of  the  vocal  tract,  appear  as  black  bands
running horizontally through regions of the speech spectrogram. These regions represent voiced segments of
speech and correspond primarily to vowels. Regions characterized by broadband high-frequency energy, and
by extremely low energy, result from noise excitation and vocal-tract closures, respectively, and are associated
with the articulation of consonantal sounds.
