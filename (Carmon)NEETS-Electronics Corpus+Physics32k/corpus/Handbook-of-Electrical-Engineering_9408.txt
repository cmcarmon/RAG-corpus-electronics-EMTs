In this variant on CSMA contention for the channel at the end of a successful transmission is mitigated by
computing a stochastic idle time for each station during which a station puts off its transmission to see if the
channel remains free. A second method of channel access in the form of polling from a master station can be
provided for trafÔ¨Åc with time delay constraints.
