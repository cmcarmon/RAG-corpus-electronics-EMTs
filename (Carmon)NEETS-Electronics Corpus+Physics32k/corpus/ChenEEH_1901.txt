This fault model, however, does not cover all types of faults.
One example is that of two signal wires X and Y being shorted
to each other (called a bridging fault). If the driver strength of
X is signiﬁcantly greater then that of Y, then Y ’s logic value will
follow X’s, which can take on either 0 or 1 values depending on
the input to the circuit. Thus Y is neither stuck-at-0 nor stuck-
at-1 permanently, though, of course, it can cause an error in
the circuit output. This fault cannot be modeled by the logical
stuck-at-fault model. Another example is that of a CMOS
NOR gate with inputs A and B. This gate has two pMOS
transistors in series connected to the supply voltage and two
nMOS transistors in parallel connected to ground. The A input
feeds a pMOS and an nMOS transistor. If the branch of the A
wire that feeds the nMOS transistor is broken, then the gate of
this transistor is at logic 0, and it never conducts. When the
inputs are A, B ¼ 1, 0, the pMOS network is not conducting,
and the nMOS network is not connected to ground (the latter
due to the wire break—the correct operation would have been
for the nMOS network to conduct). This leaves the output of
the NOR gate connected to neither supply voltage nor ground,
and it assumes the voltage is stored at its load capacitance,
which is its previous value. Thus, this fault does not manifests
itself as the NOR gate’s output (or for that matter any of its
inputs) being either stuck-at-0 or stuck-at-1.
