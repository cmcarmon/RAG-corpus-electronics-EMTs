The iron ore deposits have been mined since the start of the industrialization in the Salzgitter area. The first activities began in 1867. The shaft Konrad is the youngest of the former iron ore mines in this region. It has two shafts, of which Schacht Konrad I, is approximately 1232 meters and Schacht Konrad II is around 999 meters deep. The mining operation on Konrad lasted from 1961 to 1976. During this period, a total of 6.7 million tonnes of iron ore were retrieved.
