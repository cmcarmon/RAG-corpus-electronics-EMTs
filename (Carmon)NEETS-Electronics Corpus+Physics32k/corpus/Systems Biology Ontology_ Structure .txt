systems description parameter (catalytic constant, thermodynamic temperature...)
participant role (substrate, product, catalyst...)
modelling framework (discrete, continuous...)
mathematical expression (mass-action rate law, Hill-type rate law...)
occurring entity representation (biochemical process, molecular or genetic interaction...)
physical entity representation (transporter, physical compartment, observable...)
metadata representation (annotation)
