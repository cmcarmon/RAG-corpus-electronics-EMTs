The AT&T Datakit [Fraser, 1983] packet switch behaves as a virtual circuit switch (VCS) in that a reliable
data path is set up for each session, and packet retransmission because of collisions is not required. Remote
stations  that  may  consist  of  mainframe  computers,  concentrators  that  bring  together  many  terminals,  or
gateways to other networks are connected by 8-Mb/s Ô¨Åber-optic data links to individual electronic modules at
the central node as shown in Fig. 71.10 [Kaminow, 1988]. These modules plug into two electronic buses that
are short (about 1 m) compared to a packet propagation length (16 bytes).
