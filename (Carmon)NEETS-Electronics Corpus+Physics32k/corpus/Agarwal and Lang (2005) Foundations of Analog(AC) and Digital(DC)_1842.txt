Assume that the input B is 0 V at all times. Assume further that the input A has 0 V applied
to it initially. At time t = t0, a 5-V step is applied at the input A. Plot the form of vP as a
function of time for the under-damped and over-damped cases, assuming that vP = VS
for t < t0. Clearly show the value of vP just prior to t0 and just after t0. Assume that the
on resistance of a MOSFET is given by the relation (L/W)Rn and that the MOSFETâ€™s
threshold voltage is VT < VS. Also assume that VT < 5 V. Compare this result with
that for the inductor acting alone as computed in Problem 10.8 (Figure 10.107) in the
chapter on first-order transients.
