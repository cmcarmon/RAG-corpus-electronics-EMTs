Equation 8.2 typiﬁes an integral equation in electromag-
netics. Integral equations can also be derived for dielectric
and metallic bodies for electrostatics and electrodynamics.
These integral equations are generally solved using the
moment method. Notice that the function s(r0) in equation
8.2 has inﬁnite degrees of freedom. Such inﬁnite degrees of
freedom cannot be handled by a computer. We say that s(r0) is
a function representing a vector in an inﬁnite dimensional
space. To make equation 8.2 solvable by a computer, we ap-
proximate its solution in a ﬁnite dimension subspace using the
moment method.
To illustrate this procedure, we choose a set of functions
called basis functions that can be used to approximate s(r0).
For example, we let:
