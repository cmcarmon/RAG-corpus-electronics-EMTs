Molniya and Tundra orbits have inclination i = 63.4(cid:176). This highly inclined elliptical orbit (HIEO) causes the
satelliteâ€™s  subsatellite  ground  trace  to  dwell  at  apogee  at  the  same  place  each  day.  One  such  orbit  whose
subsatellite path traces a repetitive loop (LOOPUS) allows several satellites to be phased to offer quasi-stationary
satellite service at high latitudes. For full earth coverage from a constellation of LEO satellites, circular polar
constellations [Adams and Rider, 1987] and constellations of orbit planes with different inclinations, e.g., Walker
Orbits [Walker, 1977] have received attention.
