The ﬁrst and most important activities of the systems en-
gineer during the conceptual phase are formalization of the
speciﬁcation, determination of solution strategies, and parti-
tioning of the overall task into independent subtasks. These
tasks are forwarded to design teams specializing in different
areas, such as analog circuit design or real-time software en-
gineering. Figure 3.2 depicts the design ﬂow during conceptu-
alization and reﬁnement.
