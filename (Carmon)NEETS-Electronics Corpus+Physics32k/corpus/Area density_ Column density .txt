A special type of area density is called column (mass) density (also columnar mass density), denoted ρA or σ. It is the mass of substance per unit area integrated along a path; It is obtained integrating volumetric density



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
over a column:




σ
=
∫
ρ

d
⁡
s
.


{\displaystyle \sigma =\int \rho \;\operatorname {d} s.}

In general the integration path can be slant or oblique incidence (as in, for example, line of sight propagation in atmospheric physics). A common special case is a vertical path, from the bottom to the top of the medium:




σ
=
∫
ρ

d
⁡
z


{\displaystyle \sigma =\int \rho \;\operatorname {d} z}

where



z


{\displaystyle z}
denotes the vertical coordinate (e.g., height or depth).
Columnar density
