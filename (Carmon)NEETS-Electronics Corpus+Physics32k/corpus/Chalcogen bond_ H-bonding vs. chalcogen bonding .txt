Due to a chalcogens ability to act as an electron donor, many systems will balance between hydrogen bonding with the chalcogen as a donor or chalcogen bonding. This balance can be observed in a series of self-bonding intermolecular interactions between various substituted chalcogens. In cases with hard chalcogen atoms as acceptors, the balance favors H-bonding between chalcogen and methyl H. However, as the acceptor atoms move down the group, chalcogen-chalcogen bonding will be favored. It is hypothesized that electrostatic forces should only dominate in a chalcogen-chalcogen bond with lighter congeners, and instead that dispersion forces dominate in the cases of heavier congeners.

A means of comparing the chalcogen-chalcogen bonding forces with H-bonding is to compare the effect of various solvent environments on the chalcogen-chalcogen bond. This has been done on a series of molecules featuring a chalcogen-chalcogen intramolecular bond in one conformation (closed) and exposed to solvent interactions in another (open). One such study found that the preference for the closed conformation showed almost no dependence on the solvent environment. This was taken to mean that changes in solvent dipole moment, polarizability, or H-bonding character did not influence the balance between chalcogen-chalcogen bonding and solvent interactions. Such a conclusion would mean that the dispersion forces and electrostatic forces involved in chalcogen-chalcogen bonding do not majorly influence the interaction. Instead, this would mean that the orbital interaction dominates the bonding interaction.
