Smart systems also considerably contribute to the development of the future Internet of Things, in that they provide smart functionality to everyday objects, e.g., to industrial goods in the supply chain, or to food products in the food supply chain. With the help of active RFID technology, wireless sensors, real-time sense and response capability, energy efficiency, as well as networking functionality, objects will become smart objects. These smart objects could support the elderly and the disabled. The close tracking and monitoring of food products could improve food supply and quality. Smart industrial goods could store information about their origin, destination, components, and use. And waste disposal could become a truly efficient individual recycling process.
