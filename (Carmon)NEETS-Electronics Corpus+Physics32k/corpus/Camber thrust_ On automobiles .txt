On automobiles, camber thrust may contribute to or subtract from the total centripetal force generated by the tire, depending on the camber angle. On a well-aligned vehicle, camber thrust from the tires on each side balances out. On a surface rough enough for one front tire to momentarily lose traction, camber thrust from the other front tire can cause the vehicle to wander or feel skittish.
