You’ll find many more digital ICs other than those containing just logic gates. 
You’ll also find linear (analog) ICs that contain analog circuits and mixed‐
signal ICs that contain a combination of analog and digital circuits. Most 
ICs — except for op amps — are shown the same way in schematics: as a 
rectangle, labeled with a reference ID (such as IC1) or the part number (such 
as 74CH00), with numbered pin connections. The function of the IC is usually 
determined by looking up the part number, but the occasional schematic 
may include a functional label, such as one shot.
