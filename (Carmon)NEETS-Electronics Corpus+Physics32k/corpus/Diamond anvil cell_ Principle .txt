The operation of the diamond anvil cell relies on a simple principle:




p
=


F
A




{\displaystyle p={\frac {F}{A}}}

where p is the pressure, F the applied force, and A the area. Typical culet sizes for diamond anvils are 100â€“250 micron, such that a very high pressure is achieved by applying a moderate force on a sample with a small area, rather than applying a large force on a large area. Diamond is a very hard and virtually incompressible material, thus minimising the deformation and failure of the anvils that apply the force.
