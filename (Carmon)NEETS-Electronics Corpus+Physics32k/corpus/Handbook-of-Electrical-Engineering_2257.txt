If a quantum well is placed between two thin barriers, the tunneling probability is greatly enhanced when
the energy level in the quantum well coincides with the Fermi energy (resonant tunneling). The distance between
this “resonant” energy level and the Fermi level is controlled by the applied voltage. Consequently, the current
peaks  at  the  voltage  corresponding  to  the  resonant  tunneling  condition.  The  resulting  negative  differential
resistance  effect  has  been  used  to  fabricate  microwave  generators  operating  at  both  room  and  cryogenic
temperatures.
