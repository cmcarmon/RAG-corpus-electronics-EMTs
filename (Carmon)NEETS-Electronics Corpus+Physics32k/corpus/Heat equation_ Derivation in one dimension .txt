The heat equation is derived from Fourier's law and conservation of energy (Cannon 1984). By Fourier's law, the rate of flow of heat energy per unit area through a surface is proportional to the negative temperature gradient across the surface,





q

=
−
k

∇
u



{\displaystyle \mathbf {q} =-k\,\nabla u\ }

where k is the thermal conductivity and u is the temperature. In one dimension, the gradient is an ordinary spatial derivative, and so Fourier's law is




q
=
−
k



∂
u


∂
x






{\displaystyle q=-k{\frac {\partial u}{\partial x}}\,}

In the absence of work done, a change in internal energy per unit volume in the material, ΔQ, is proportional to the change in temperature, Δu (in this section only, Δ is the ordinary difference operator with respect to time, not the Laplacian with respect to space). That is,




Δ
Q
=

c

p


ρ

Δ
u



{\displaystyle \Delta Q=c_{p}\rho \,\Delta u\,}

where cp is the specific heat capacity and ρ is the mass density of the material. Choosing zero energy at absolute zero temperature, this can be rewritten as




Q
=

c

p


ρ
u
.



{\displaystyle Q=c_{p}\rho u.\,}

where the fundamental theorem of calculus was used. If no work is done and there are neither heat sources nor sinks, the change in internal energy in the interval [x−Δx, x+Δx] is accounted for entirely by the flux of heat across the boundaries. By Fourier's law, this is

This is true for any rectangle [t −Δt, t + Δt] × [x − Δx, x + Δx]. By the fundamental lemma of the calculus of variations, the integrand must vanish identically:

which is the heat equation, where the coefficient (often denoted α)




α

{\displaystyle \alpha ={\frac {k}{c_{p}\rho }}\,\!}

is called the thermal diffusivity.
An additional term may be introduced into the equation to account for radiative loss of heat, which depends upon the excess temperature u = T − Ts at a given point compared with the surroundings. At low excess temperatures, the radiative loss is approximately μu, giving a one-dimensional heat-transfer equation of the form

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial u}{\partial t}}={\frac {k}{c_{p}\rho }}\left({\frac {\partial ^{2}u}{\partial x^{2}}}\right)-\mu u.}
