where X(s) denotes the Laplace transform of the unshifted signal x(t). As a general rule, any time a term of the
form  e –s t 0  appears  in  X(s),  this  implies  some  form  of  time  shift  in  the  time  domain.  This  most  important
property  is  depicted  in  Fig.  6.2.  It  should  be  further  noted  that  the  regions  of  absolute  convergence  for  the
signals  x(t) and  x(t – t0) are identical.
