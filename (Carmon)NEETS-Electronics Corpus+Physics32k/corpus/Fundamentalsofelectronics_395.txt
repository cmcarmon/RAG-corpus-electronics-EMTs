What this means is that the error between a signal and its Fourier series approximation may not be zero,
but that its rms value will be zero! It is through the eyes of the rms value that we redeﬁne equality: The
usual deﬁnition of equality is called point wise equality: Two signals s1 (t), s2 (t) are said to be equal
point wise if s1 (t) = s2 (t) for all values of t. A new deﬁnition of equality is mean-square equality: Two
signals are said to be equal in the mean square if rms (s1 − s2) = 0. For Fourier series, Gibbs’ phenomenon
peaks have ﬁnite height and zero width. The error diﬀers from zero only at isolated points—whenever the
periodic signal contains discontinuities—and equals about 9% of the size of the discontinuity. The value of
a function at a ﬁnite set of points does not aﬀect its integral. This eﬀect underlies the reason why deﬁning
the value of a discontinuous function at its discontinuity, like when we deﬁned the step function on page 17,
