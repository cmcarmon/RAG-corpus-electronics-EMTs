4.2
Linearity is the property of an element describing a linear relationship
between  cause  and  effect. Although  the  property  applies  to  many  cir-
cuit  elements,  we  shall  limit  its  applicability  to  resistors  in  this  chap-
ter.  The  property  is  a  combination  of  both  the  homogeneity  (scaling)
property and the additivity property.
