Solid state oscillators represent the basic microwave energy source and have the advantages of light weight and
small size compared with microwave tubes. As shown in Fig. 43.6, a typical microwave oscillator consists of a
MESFET as an active device (a diode can also be used) and a passive frequency-determining resonant element,
such  as  a  microstrip,  surface  acoustic  wave  (SAW),  cavity  resonator,  or  dielectric  resonator  for  ﬁxed  tuned
oscillators and a varactor or a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere for tunable oscillators. These oscillators have
the  capability  of  temperature  stabilization  and  phase  locking.  Dielectric  resonator  oscillators  provide  stable
operation from 1 to 100 GHz as ﬁxed frequency sources. In addition to their good frequency stability, they are
simple in design, have high efﬁciency, and are compatible with MMIC technology. Gunn and IMPATT oscillators
provide higher power levels and cover microwave and millimeter wave bands. The transistor oscillators using
MESFETs, HEMTS, and HBTs provide highly cost-effective, miniature, reliable, and low-noise sources for use
up  to  the  millimeter  wave  frequency  range,  while  BJT  oscillators  reach  only  20  GHz.  Compared  to  a  GaAs
MESFET oscillator, a BJT or a HBT oscillator typically has 6 to 10 dB lower phase noise very close to the carrier.
Figure  43.7  shows  the  performance  of  various  solid  state  oscillators.  Higher  power  levels  for  oscillators  are
obtained by connecting high-power ampliﬁers at the output of medium-power oscillators.
