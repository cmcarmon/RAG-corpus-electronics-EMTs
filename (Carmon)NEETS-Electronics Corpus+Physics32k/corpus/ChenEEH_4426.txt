Note that in the theorem systems Gp(s) and Gc (s) can be
interchanged. Some nonlinear extensions of these results are
also obtained in Isidori et al. (1999). Passivity-based control-
lers based on these fundamental stability results have proven to
be highly effective in robustly controlling inherently passive
linear and nonlinear systems.
