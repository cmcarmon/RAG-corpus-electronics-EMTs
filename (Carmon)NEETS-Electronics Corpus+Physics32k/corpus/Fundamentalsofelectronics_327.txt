Problem 3.38: Analog Computers
Because the diﬀerential equations arising in circuits resemble those that describe mechanical motion, we
can use circuit models to describe mechanical systems. An ELEC 241 student wants to understand the
suspension system on his car. Without a suspension, the car’s body moves in concert with the bumps in the
road. A well-designed suspension system will smooth out bumpy roads, reducing the car’s vertical motion.
If the bumps are very gradual (think of a hill as a large but very gradual bump), the car’s vertical motion
should follow that of the road. The student wants to ﬁnd a simple circuit that will model the car’s motion.
He is trying to decide between two circuit models (Figure 3.78).
