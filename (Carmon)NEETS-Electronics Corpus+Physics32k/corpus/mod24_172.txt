Intrinsic Absorption.â€”Intrinsic absorption is caused by basic fiber-material properties. If an optical
fiber were absolutely pure, with no imperfections or impurities, then all absorption would be intrinsic.
Intrinsic absorption sets the minimal level of absorption. In fiber optics, silica (pure glass) fibers are used
predominately. Silica fibers are used because of their low intrinsic material absorption at the wavelengths
of operation.
