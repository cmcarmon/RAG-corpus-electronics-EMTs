{\displaystyle K_{\text{rot}}={\frac {1}{2}}I\omega ^{2},}

just as Ktrans = ​1⁄2mv2 in linear dynamics.
Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. The amount of translational kinetic energy found in two variables: the mass of the object (m) and the speed of the object (v) as show in the equation above. Kinetic energy must always be either zero or a positive value. While velocity can have either a positive or negative value, velocity squared will always be positive.
