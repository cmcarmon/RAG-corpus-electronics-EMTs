Solution:
As  shown  in  Fig.  8.45(a),  we  ﬁrst  locate  nodes  1  and  2  in  the  two
meshes and also the ground node 0 for the dual circuit. We draw a line
between one node and another crossing an element. We replace the line
joining  the  nodes  by  the  duals  of  the  elements  which  it  crosses.  For
example, a line between nodes 1 and 2 crosses a 2-H inductor, and we
place  a  2-F  capacitor  (an  inductor’s  dual)  on  the  line. A line  between
nodes  1  and  0  crossing  the  6-V voltage  source  will  contain  a  6-A
current source. By drawing lines crossing all the elements, we construct
the dual circuit on the given circuit as in Fig. 8.45(a). The dual circuit
is redrawn in Fig. 8.45(b) for clarity.
