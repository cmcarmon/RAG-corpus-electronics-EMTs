These equations indicate that for linear R, L, or C, in each case the complex
amplitude of the voltage is related to the complex amplitude of the current
by very simple algebraic expressions which are generalizations of Ohmâ€™s Law.
The constants relating V to I in Equations 13.33, 13.34, and 13.35 are called
impedances, and these equations are the constituent relations for C, L, and R
expressed in impedance form. The constituent relations for these elements and
for voltage and current sources are summarized in Figure 13.8.
