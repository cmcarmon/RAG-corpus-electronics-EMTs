In general, performance of distribution systems and quality of
the service provided are measured in terms of freedom from
interruptions and maintenance of satisfactory voltage levels at
the consumer’s premises that are within limits appropriate for
this type of service. Due to economic considerations, an elec-
tric utility company cannot provide each consumer with a
constant voltage matching exactly the nameplate voltage on
the consumer’s utilization equipment. Thus, a common prac-
tice among the utilities is to stay with preferred voltage levels
and ranges of variation for satisfactory operation of equip-
ments set forth by the ANSI standard.
