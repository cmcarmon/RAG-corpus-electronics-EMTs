The more resistors are connected in parallel, the 
less opposition there is to current flow. The less oppo‑
sition there is to current flow, the lower the resistance 
in the circuit. In other words, when a resistor is added 
in parallel to a circuit, the total resistance in the circuit 
decreases because additional paths for current flow are 
provided. In a parallel circuit, the total resistance is al‑
ways less than the resistance of any branch.
