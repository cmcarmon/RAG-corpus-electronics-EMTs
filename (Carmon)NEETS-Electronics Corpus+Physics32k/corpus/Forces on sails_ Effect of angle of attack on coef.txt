Each type of sail, acting as an airfoil, has characteristic coefficients of lift (CL ) and lift-induced drag (CD ) at a given angle of attack, which follow that same basic form of:




C

F

2


ρ



V

A

A





{\displaystyle C={\frac {F}{{\frac {1}{2}}\rho {V_{A}}^{2}A}}}

Where force (F) equals lift (L) for forces measured perpendicular to the airstream to determine C = CL or force (F) equals drag (D) for forces measured in line with the airstream to determine C = CD on a sail of area (A) and a given aspect ratio (length to average cord width). These coefficients vary with angle of attack (αj for a headsail) with respect to the incident wind (VA for a headsail). This formulation allows determination of CL and CD experimentally for a given sail shape by varying angle of attack at an experimental wind velocity and measuring force on the sail in the direction of the incident wind (D—drag) and perpendicular to it (L—lift). As the angle of attack grows larger, the lift reaches a maximum at some angle; increasing the angle of attack beyond this critical angle of attack causes the upper-surface flow to separate from the convex surface of the sail; there is less deflection of air to windward, so the sail as airfoil generates less lift. The sail is said to be stalled. At the same time, induced drag increases with angle of attack (for the headsail: αj ).

Determination of coefficients of lift (CL ) and drag (CD ) for angle of attack and aspect ratio

Fossati presents polar diagrams that relate coefficients of lift and drag for different angles of attack based on the work of Gustave Eiffel, who pioneered wind tunnel experiments on airfoils, which he published in 1910. Among them were studies of cambered plates. The results shown are for plates of varying camber and aspect ratios, as shown. They show that, as aspect ratio decreases, maximum lift shifts further towards increased drag (rightwards in the diagram). They also show that, for lower angles of attack, a higher aspect ratio generates more lift and less drag than for lower aspect ratios.
