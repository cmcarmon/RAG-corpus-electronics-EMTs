Usually, the precise wavelength of any given semiconductor diode is uncertain. Deviation from a speciﬁed
wavelength could degrade isolator performance by 1 dB/nm, and an uncertainty of 10 nm can reduce isolation
by  10  dB.  Therefore,  a  tunable  optical  isolator  is  highly  desirable. A  typical  approach  is  to  simply  place  two
isolators,  tuned  to  different  wavelengths,  in  tandem  to  provide  a  broadband  response.  Curves  C  and  D  of
Fig. 57.3 show that isolation and bandwidth are a function of the proximity of the wavelength peak positions.
This  combination  of  nontunable  isolators  has  sufﬁciently  wide  spectral  bandwidth  to  accommodate  normal
wavelength variations found in typical diode lasers. In addition, because the laser wavelength depends on its
operating  temperature,  this  broadened  spectral  bandwidth  widens  the  operating  temperature  range  without
decreasing isolation.
