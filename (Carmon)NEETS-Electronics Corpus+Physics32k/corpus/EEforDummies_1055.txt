▶✓ If your circuit uses one or more CMOS chips, insert the CMOS chips 
last. If you need to, use a dummy TTL IC to make sure that you wired 
everything properly. TTL chips aren’t nearly as sensitive to static as the 
CMOS variety. Be sure to provide connections for the positive and nega-
tive power supply — and to connect all inputs (tie the inputs that you 
aren’t using to the positive or negative supply rail). When you’re ready to 
test the circuit, remove the dummy chip and replace it with the CMOS IC.
