In practice, the phase conductors may not be equally spaced
as they are in Figure 7.5. This results in unbalanced conditions
due to the imbalance in mutual
inductance. High-voltage
transmission lines with such a layout can be transposed so
that, on average, the distance between phases is equal canceling
out the imbalance. The equivalent distance of separation be-
tween phases can then be found as the geometric mean of this
spacing. Similarly, if several conductors are used per phase, an
equivalent conductor radius can be found as the geometric
mean.
