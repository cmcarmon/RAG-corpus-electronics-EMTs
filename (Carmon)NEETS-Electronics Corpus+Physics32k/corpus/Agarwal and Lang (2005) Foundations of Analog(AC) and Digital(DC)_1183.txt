let us
compute the incremental current and power gain for the common emitter BJT amplifier.
Both the current gain and the power gain are defined as the current or power supplied
to an external load divided by the current or power supplied by an input source. Accord-
ingly, as illustrated in Figure 8.47, let us add an external load resistance ROUT to our
circuit to facilitate current and power gain measurements.
