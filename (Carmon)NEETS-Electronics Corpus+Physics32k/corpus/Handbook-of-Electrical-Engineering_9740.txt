Password
At this point of your login, youâ€™ll be asked to create a password. This password is the key to your account and
the tighter you guard it, the more secure your system will be. Common passwords are a combination of letter
and  number  characters,  usually  eight  or  so  in  number.  Obviously,  these  can  be  the  subject  of  unauthorized
usage. The more creative the password, the more secure it will be.
