Before starting to troubleshoot an electronic cir-
cuit, a good wiring diagram of the circuit is required. 
There are two types of wiring diagrams: a block dia-
gram (Figure 50-7a) and a schematic diagram (Figure 
50-7b). A block diagram lays out the components of 
the system and how they relate to each other. It helps 
to gain an understanding of the basic system and how 
it works. A schematic diagram provides more detail 
than the block diagram by using schematic symbols to 
show the individual components of a circuit and how 
they are interconnected.
