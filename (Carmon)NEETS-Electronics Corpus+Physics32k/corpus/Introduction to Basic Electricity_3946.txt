Figure 38-17 shows an RF amplifier used in a tele-
vision VHF tuner. The circuit is tuned by coils L1A, L1B, 
and L1C. When the channel selector is turned, a new 
set of coils is switched into the circuit. This provides 
the necessary bandwidth response for each channel. 
The input signal is developed across the tuned circuit 
consisting of L1A, C1, and C2. Transistor Q1 operates 
as a class A amplifier. The collector-output circuit is a 
double-tuned transformer. Coil L1B is tuned by capaci-
tor C4, and coil L1C is tuned by capacitor C7. Resistor 
R2 and capacitor C6 form a decoupling filter to prevent 
any RF from entering the power supply to interact 
with other circuits.
