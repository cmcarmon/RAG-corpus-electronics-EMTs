Here e is the generation rate unit volume, Aj is the junction area, q is the elementary charge, Xd is the depletion
layer thickness, and K is a dimensional constant. IG is proportional to the thickness Xd of the depletion layer
and to the junction area Aj. Since Xd increases with the square root of the reverse voltage, IG increases accordingly,
yielding a slight slope in the reverse I-V characteristic. The forward I-V characteristic of the practical diode is
only slightly affected (slope m = 2) at very small forward currents (ID = 1 nA to 1 mA). In practical diodes n Â»
1 at small to medium currents (ID = 1 mA to 10 mA). At large currents (ID > 10 mA), m = 1 to 2 due to the
high current effects [Phillips, 1962] and due to the series bulk resistance of the diode.
