A voltage multiplier circuit is shown in ﬁgure 4.10. We can think of it as two half-wave
rectiﬁer circuits in series. During the positive half-cycle one of the diodes conducts and
charges a capacitor. During the negative half-cycle the other diode conducts negatively to
charge the other capacitor. The voltage across the combination is therefore equal to twice
the peak voltage. In this type of circuit we have to assume that the load does not draw a
signiﬁcant charge from the capacitors.
