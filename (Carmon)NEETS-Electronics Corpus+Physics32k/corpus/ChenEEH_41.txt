A network consisting of linear resistors and dependent and
independent sources with a pair of accessible terminals can be
represented by an equivalent circuit with a voltage source and a
series resistance as shown in Figure 1.15. VTH is equal to the
open circuit voltage across the two terminals A and B, and RTH
is the resistance measured across nodes A and B (also called
looking-in resistance) when the independent sources in the
network are deactivated. The RTH can also be determined as
RTH ¼ Voc=Isc, where Voc
is the open circuit voltage across
terminals A and B and where Isc is the short circuit current
that will ﬂow from A to B through an external zero resistance
connection (short circuit) if one is made.
