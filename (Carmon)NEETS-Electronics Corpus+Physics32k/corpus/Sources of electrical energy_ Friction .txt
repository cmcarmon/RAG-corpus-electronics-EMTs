Friction is the least methods which you provide of the six methods of producing energy. If a cloth rubs against an object, the object will display an effect called friction electricity. The object becomes charged due to the rubbing process, and now possesses an electrical charge. There are two main types of electrical charge: positive and negative. Each type of charge attracts the opposite type and repels the same type. This can be stated in the following way: Like charges repel and unlike charges attract. Static electricity has several applications. Its main application is in Van de Graaff generators, used to produce high voltages in order to test the dialectric strength of insulating materials. Other uses are in electrostatic painting and sandpaper manufacturing. The course grains acquire a negative charge as they move across the negative plate. As unlike charges attract, the positive plate attracts the course grains and their impact velocity enables them to be embedded into the adhesive.
