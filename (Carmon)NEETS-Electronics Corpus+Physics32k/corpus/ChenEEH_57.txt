Example 1.8. Consider the circuit given in Figure
1.25(A) and convert a linear circuit into an s-domain
circuit. You can obtain the s-domain circuit shown
in Figure 1.25(B) by replacing each element by its
equivalent s-domain element. As noted previously, the
differential relations of the elements on application of
the Laplace transform have become algebraic relations.
Applying KVL around the loop, you can obtain the
following equations:
