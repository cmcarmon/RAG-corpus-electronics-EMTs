A representative field type of electron tube tester designed to test all common low-power tubes is
shown in figure 2-1. The tube test conditions are as close as possible to actual tube operating conditions
and are programmed on a prepunched card. The card switch (S101, fig. 2-1) automatically programs the
tube test conditions when it is actuated by a card. A card compartment on the front panel of the tester
provides storage for the most frequently used cards. The cover of the tester (not shown) contains the
operating instructions, the brackets for storing the technical manual, the power cord, the calibration cell
for checking the meter and short tests, the calibration cards, the blank cards, and a steel hand punch.
