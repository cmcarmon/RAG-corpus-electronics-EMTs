In the range Hc 1 < H < Hc2, a type II superconductor is said to be in the vortex state because now the applied
ﬁeld can enter the bulk superconductor. Because ﬂux exists in the material, however, the superconductivity is
destroyed locally, creating normal regions. Recall that for type II materials the boundary between the normal
and superconducting regions lowers the overall energy of the system. Therefore, the ﬂux in the superconductor
creates  as  many  normal–superconducting  interfaces  as  possible  without  violating  quantum  criteria.  The  net
result is that ﬂux enters a type II superconductor in quantized bundles of magnitude F
o known as vortices or
ﬂuxons (the former name derives from the fact that current ﬂows around each quantized bundle in the same
manner as a ﬂuid vortex circulates around a drain). The central portion of a vortex, known as the core, is a
normal region with an approximate radius of j. If a defect-free superconductor is placed in a magnetic ﬁeld,
the individual vortices, whose cores essentially follow the local average ﬁeld lines, form an ordered triangular
array, or ﬂux lattice. As the applied ﬁeld is raised beyond Hc 1 (where the ﬁrst vortex enters the superconductor),
the distance between adjacent vortex cores decreases to maintain the appropriate ﬂux density in the material.
Finally,  the  upper  critical  ﬁeld  is  reached  when  the  normal  cores  overlap  and  the  material  is  no  longer
superconducting. Indeed, a precise calculation of Hc2 using the phenomenological theory developed by Vitaly
Ginzburg and Lev Landau yields
