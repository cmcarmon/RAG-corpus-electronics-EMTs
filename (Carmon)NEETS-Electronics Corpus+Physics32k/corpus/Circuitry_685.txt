Sine/square waveforms (dualâ€“channel operation) 
 
The  procedure  for  displaying  two  waveforms 
(either sine or square or any other repetitive signal) 
simultaneously  is  shown  in  Fig.  14.29.  The  two 
signals  are  connected  to  their  respective  inputs 
(Channel 1 and Channel 2) and the mode switch set
