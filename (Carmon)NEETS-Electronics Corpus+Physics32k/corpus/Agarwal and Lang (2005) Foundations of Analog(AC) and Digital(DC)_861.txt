increases, more negative charges are attracted to the surface until they form
an n-type conducting channel that connects the source and the drain. The
conducting channel forms when the gate voltage crosses a threshold voltage
VT (in other words, vGS > VT). A current begins to flow between the drain and
the source when a positive voltage is applied across the drain and the source
(vDS > 0). The MOSFET in our example is called an n-channel device because
of the n-type channel that is formed.
