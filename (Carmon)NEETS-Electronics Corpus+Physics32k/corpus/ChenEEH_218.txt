Circuit voltages and currents are solutions to nonlinear
differential-algebraic equations that describe circuit behavior.
Of particular interest are circuit equilibrium points, which are
solutions to associated nonlinear algebraic equations. Hence,
circuit equilibrium points are related to dc operating points of
a resistive circuit with all capacitors and inductors removed.
If capacitor voltages and inductor currents are chosen as
state variables, there is a one-to-one correspondence between
the circuitâ€™s equilibrium points and dc operating points (Chva
et al., 1987).
