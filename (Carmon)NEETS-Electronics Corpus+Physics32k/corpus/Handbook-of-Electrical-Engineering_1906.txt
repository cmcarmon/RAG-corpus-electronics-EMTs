The  successful  convergence  and  implementation  of  MPEG-1  and  MPEG-2  have  become  a  catalyst  for
propelling the new digital consumer markets such as Video CD, Digital TV, DVD, and DBS. While the MPEG-1
and  MPEG-2  standards  were  primarily  targeted  at  providing  high  compression  efÔ¨Åciency  for  storage  and
transmission  of  pixel-based  video  and  audio,  MPEG-4  envisions  to  support  a  wide  variety  of  multimedia
applications  and  new  functionalities  of  object-based  audio-visual  (AV)  contents.  The  recent  completion  of
MPEG-4  Version 1  is  expected  to  provide  a  stimulus  to  the  emerging  multimedia  applications  in  wireless
networks, Internet, and content creation.
