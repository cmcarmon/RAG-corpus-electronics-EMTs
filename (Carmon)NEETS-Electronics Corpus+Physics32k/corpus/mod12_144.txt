CRYSTAL MICROPHONE.â€”The CRYSTAL MICROPHONE uses the PIEZOELECTRIC 
EFFECT of Rochelle salt, quartz, or other crystalline materials. This means that when mechanical stress is 
placed upon the material, a voltage electromagnetic force (EMF) is generated. Since Rochelle salt has the 
largest voltage output for a given mechanical stress, it is the most commonly used crystal in microphones. 
View (A) of figure 1-34 is a crystal microphone in which the crystal is mounted so that the sound waves 
strike it directly. View (B) has a diaphragm that is mechanically linked to the crystal so that the sound 
waves are indirectly coupled to the crystal.
