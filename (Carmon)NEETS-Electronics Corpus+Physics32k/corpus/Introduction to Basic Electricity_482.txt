The two parts of any type of  harassment 
are unwanted and continued  behavior. 
If no one says to stop the  behavior or 
 comments, or if the behavior does not 
continue, no harassment has taken place. 
Single instances or comments toward an 
individual or group may be in bad taste 
or show poor judgment by an individual 
but do not constitute harassment in the 
workplace.
