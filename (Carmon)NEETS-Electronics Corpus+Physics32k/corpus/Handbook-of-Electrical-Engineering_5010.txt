where nij is the recurrence rate of the jth discharge in the ith cavity and DQij is its corresponding charge release
at an applied voltage Vij . Under ac conditions the discharges will tend to recur regularly in each cycle due to
the capacitative voltage division across the void. Under dc conditions the discharge rate will be controlled by
the  time  constant  required  to  recharge  the  cavity  following  a  discharge.  The  physical  damage  arising  from
discharges consists of surface erosion and pitting and is caused by the ion and electron bombardment incident
on the void’s walls at a given discharge site. Chemical degradation results from molecular chain scission due
to  particle  bombardment  of  the  surface  and  the  reactions  between  the  ambient  ionized  gases  and  the  gases
released due to the molecular chain scission processes. The ﬁnal chemical composition of the reaction product
is generally varied, depending primarily on the molecular structure of the dielectric materials involved and the
composition  of  the  ambient  ionized  gases;  one  discharge  degradation  product  common  to  many  polymers
exposed  to  discharges  in  air  is  that  of  oxalic  acid.  Oxalic  acid,  as  a  result  of  its  elevated  conductivity,  when
deposited upon the cavity’s walls may change the nature of the discharge (e.g., from a spark to a glow type) or
may  even  ultimately  extinguish  the  discharge  (i.e.,  replace  the  discharge  loss  by  an  I2R-type  loss  along  the
cavity’s walls).
