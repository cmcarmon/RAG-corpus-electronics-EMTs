An electrical machine will operate at a speed determined by the
electric torque or force produced and the mechanical load
(Figure 4.6). If these are equal and opposite, the machine will
operate at a constant speed; if not, the machine will accelerate
or decelerate at a rate proportional to the net accelerating force
or torque. Newtonâ€™s law describes this process. Writing this for
a rotational system:
