*4.2.7 Balanced wye-connected loads drawing 10 kW
at 0.8 power factor lagging and 15 kW at 0.9
power factor leading are connected in parallel and
supplied by a 60-Hz, 300-V, three-phase system.
Find the line current delivered by the source.
4.2.8 A balanced delta-connected load with a per-phase
impedance of 30 + j10  is connected in parallel
with a balanced wye-connected load with a per-
phase impedance of 40âˆ’ j10 . This load combi-
nation is connected to a balanced three-phase sup-
ply through three conductors, each of which has a
resistance of 0.4 . The line-to-line voltage at the
terminals of the load combination is measured to
be 2000 V. Determine the power in kW:
