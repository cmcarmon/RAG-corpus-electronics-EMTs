the thyristor, a signiﬁcant amount of electrons will be injected
across the forward-biased junction, J3, into the base of the
n1p2n2 transistor. The resulting collector current provides
base current to the p1n1p2 transistor. The combination of
the positive feedback connection of the npn and pnp BJTs
and the current-dependent base transport factors eventually
turn the thyristor on by regenerative action. Among the power
semiconductor devices known, the thyristor shows the lowest
forward voltage drop at large current densities. The large
current ﬂow between the anode and cathode maintains both
transistors in saturation region, and gate control is lost once
the thyristor latches on.
