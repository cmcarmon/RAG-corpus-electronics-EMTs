total load requirement is to be divided among the generators
in service is denoted the generation dispatch problem. This
problem clearly optimizes the total generation costs in produ-
cing the required amount of active power. We discuss this
problem ﬁrst in Secton 8.2.1 under a classical formulation.
Moreover, there are also active power losses involved in trans-
mitting real power from generators to loads. Some generators,
such as those near coal mines with low fuel costs, may incur
large transmission losses in transferring the generated power to
load centers. An optimization formulation that includes some
simple consideration of transmission losses together with gen-
eration costs is presented in Section 8.2.2. Section 8.2.3 dis-
cusses a general framework for posing detailed optimization
problems in the form of optimal power ﬂow formulation.
