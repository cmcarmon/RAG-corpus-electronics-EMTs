13.2.9 A 500-hp, wye-connected, wound-rotor induc-
tion motor, when operated at rated voltage and
frequency, develops its rated full-load output at
a slip of 0.02; maximum torque of 2 times the
full-load torque at a slip of 0.06, with a referred
rotor current of 3 times that at full load; and 1.2
times the full-load torque at a slip of 0.2, with a
referred rotor current of 4 times that at full load.
Neglect rotational and stray-load losses. If the
rotor-circuit resistance in all phases is increased
to 5 times the original resistance, determine the
following:
