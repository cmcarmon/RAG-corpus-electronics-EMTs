Note, however, that the circuit is inverting and causes a
(normally unimportant) phase shift of 1808. The example of
the ﬁrst-order low-pass in equation 4.7 is realized by the
circuit in Figure 4.5 with C1 ¼ 0, R2 ¼ 2:31R1, and C2R2 ¼ 1=
(16:8 krad=s). The
can be determined if
C2 is chosen (e.g., as 1 nF). We obtain R1 ¼ 4:10 kV and
R2 ¼ 9:47 kV.
