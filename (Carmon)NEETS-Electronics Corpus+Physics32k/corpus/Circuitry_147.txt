The bridge will be balanced (and VAB = 0) when 
the  ratio  of  R1:R2 is  the  same  as  the  ratio  R3:R4.
Hence, at balance:

A practical form of Wheatstone bridge that can be 
used  for  measuring  unknown  resistances  is  shown 
in Fig. 3.14.  
In  this  practical  form  of  Wheatstone  bridge,  R1
 
and  R2 are  called  the  ratio  arms  while  one  arm 
(that occupied by R3 in Fig. 3.13) is replaced by a 
calibrated  variable  resistor.  The  unknown  resistor, 
Rx, is connected in the fourth arm. At balance: 
R
