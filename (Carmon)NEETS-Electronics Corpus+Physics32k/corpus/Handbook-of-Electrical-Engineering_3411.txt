Successive approximation A/D conversion is a technique that is commonly used in medium- to high-speed
data acquisition applications. It is one of the fastest A/D conversion techniques that requires a minimum amount
of circuitry. The conversion times for successive approximation A/D conversion typically range from 10 to 300

The successive approximation A/D converter can approximate the analog signal to form an

 bits in the code. The comparison is accomplished as follows: The SAR determines
 ranges, to determine the 
if the analog input is above or below the midpoint and sets the bit of the digital code accordingly. The SAR
assigns the bits beginning with the most signiÔ¨Åcant bit. The bit is set to a 1 if the analog input is greater than
the midpoint voltage, or it is set to a 0 if it is less than the midpoint voltage. The SAR then moves to the next
bit and sets it to a 1 or a 0 based on the results of comparing the analog input with the midpoint of the next
