If a point charge Q is placed at r=0 in a solid, what field will it produce, taking electron screening into account?
One seeks a self-consistent solution to two equations:
The Thomas–Fermi screening formula gives the charge density at each point r as a function of the potential



ϕ
(

r

)


{\displaystyle \phi (\mathbf {r} )}
at that point.
The Poisson equation (derived from Gauss's law) relates the second derivative of the potential to the charge density.
For the nonlinear Thomas-Fermi formula, solving these simultaneously can be difficult, and usually there is no analytical solution. However, the linearized formula has a simple solution:




ϕ
(

r

)
=


Q
r



e

−

k

0


r




{\displaystyle \phi (\mathbf {r} )={\frac {Q}{r}}e^{-k_{0}r}}
(cgs-Gaussian)
With k0=0 (no screening), this becomes the familiar Coulomb's law.
Note that there may be dielectric permittivity in addition to the screening discussed here; for example due to the polarization of immobile core electrons. In that case, replace Q by Q/ε, where ε is the relative permittivity due to these other contributions.
