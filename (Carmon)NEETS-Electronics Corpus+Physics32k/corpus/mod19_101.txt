The symptoms of a person suffering from shock are caused, directly or indirectly, by the disturbance 
of the circulation of the blood. The pulse is weak and rapid. Breathing is likely to be shallow, rapid, and 
irregular, because the poor circulation of the blood affects the breathing center in the brain. The 
temperature near the surface of the body is lowered because of the poor blood flow; so the face, arms, and 
legs feel cold to the touch. Sweating is likely to be very noticeable. A person in shock is usually very 
pale, but in some cases the skin may have a bluish or reddish color. As mentioned previously when we 
were discussing electric shock, in the care of victims with dark skin, it may be necessary to rely primarily 
on the color of the mucous membranes on the inside of the mouth or under the eyelid or under the nail 
bed. A person in or going into shock has a bluish color to these membranes instead of a healthy pink. The 
pupils of the eyes are usually dilated (enlarged).
