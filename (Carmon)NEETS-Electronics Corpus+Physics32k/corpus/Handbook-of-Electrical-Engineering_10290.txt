The  commercial  air  transport  industry  adheres  to  multiple  standards  at  various  levels.  The  International
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is commissioned by the United Nations to govern aviation systems includ-
ing  but  not  limited  to  Data  Communications  Systems,  On-Board  Recorders,  Instrument  Landing  Systems,
Microwave Landing Systems, VHF OmniRange Systems, and Distance Measuring Equipment. The ICAO Stan-
dards and Recommended Practices (SARPS) control system performance, availability requirements, frequency
utilization,  etc.  at  the  international  level.  The  SARPS  in  general  maintain  alignment  between  the  national
avionics standards such as those published by EUROCAE and RTCA.
