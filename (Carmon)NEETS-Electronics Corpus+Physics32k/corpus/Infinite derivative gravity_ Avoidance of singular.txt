, thus avoiding the cosmological singularity problem. The propagator around a flat space background was obtained in 2013.
This action avoids a curvature singularity for a small perturbation to a flat background near the origin, while recovering the

fall of the GR potential at large distances. This is done using the linearised equations of motion which is a valid approximation because if the perturbation is small enough and the mass scale

is large enough, then the perturbation will always be small enough that quadratic terms can be neglected. It also avoids the Hawking-Penrose singularity in this context. The singularity is avoided because gravitational interaction in infinite derivative gravity smears out any point-like source and leads to a conformal solution deep inside the ultraviolet limit.
