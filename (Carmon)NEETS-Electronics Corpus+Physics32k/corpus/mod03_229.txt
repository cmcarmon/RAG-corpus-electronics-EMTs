A perfectly circular disk would tend to turn continuously. This is not desirable, and so the disk is
constructed so that it will turn only a certain amount clockwise or counterclockwise about the center
position, which is commonly marked 60 hertz on commercial equipment. To prevent the disk from
turning more than the desired amount, the left half of the disk is mounted so that when motion occurs, the
same amount of disk area will always be between the poles of coil A. Therefore, the force produced by
coil A to rotate the disk is constant for a constant applied voltage. The right half of the disk is offset, as
shown in the figure. When the disk rotates clockwise, an increasing area will come between the poles of
coil B; when it rotates counterclockwise, a decreasing area will come between the poles of coil B. The
greater the area between the poles, the greater will be the disk current and the force tending to turn the
disk.
