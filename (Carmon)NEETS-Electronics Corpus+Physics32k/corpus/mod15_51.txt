Synchros used in the Navy can be grouped into two broad categories: MILITARY STANDARD 
SYNCHROS and PRESTANDARD NAVY SYNCHROS. Military standard synchros conform to 
specifications that are uniform throughout the armed services. New varieties of equipment use synchros 
of this type. Prestandard synchros were designed to meet Navy, rather than servicewide, specifications. 
Each category has its own designation code for identification.
