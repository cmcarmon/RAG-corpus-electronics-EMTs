The operations so far introduced are summarized in Table 6.1.2. Any Boolean function can
be transformed from an algebraic expression into a combinational network by using the basic
logic gates. It is always desirable, however, to implement a given Boolean function by using the
minimum number of components, leading to a less complex and more economical network. Table
6.1.3 gives the basic Boolean identities for which the truth tables for the expressions on either
side of the equals sign are the same. The reader should note that, in general, it is improper to draw
a diagram in which the outputs of any two blocks are connected together. Two outputs can be
combined by using them as two inputs to another gate.
