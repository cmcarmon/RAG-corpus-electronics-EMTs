Using the thermal conductivities tabulated in Table 33.1, conduction resistance values for packaging materials
with typical dimensions can be found by use of Eq. 33.3 or by inspection of Fig. 33.2. Values are seen to range
 by 25 micron
from 2K/W for a 100 mm
2
(1 mil)  thick  layer  of  copper.  Similarly,  the  values  of  the  conduction  resistance  for  typical  “soft”  bonding
materials are found to lie in the range of 0.1 K/W for solder and 1–3K/W for epoxies and thermal pastes, for
D
x/A ratios of 0.25 to 1 m
