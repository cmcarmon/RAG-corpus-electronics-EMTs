{\displaystyle T_{11}=2\eta _{0}\lambda {\dot {\gamma }}^{2}\left(1-\exp \left(-{\frac {t}{\lambda }}\right)\left(1+{\frac {t}{\lambda }}\right)\right)}

The equations above describe stresses gradually risen from zero the steady-state values. The equation is only applicable, when the velocity profile in the shear flow is fully developed. Then the shear rate is constant over the channel height. If the start-up form a zero velocity distribution has to be calculated, the full set of PDEs has to be solved.
