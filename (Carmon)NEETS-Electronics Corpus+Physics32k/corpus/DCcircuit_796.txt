The same principle of using different contact points for current conduction and voltage
measurement is used in precision shunt resistors for measuring large amounts of current. As
discussed previously, shunt resistors function as current measurement devices by dropping
a precise amount of voltage for every amp of current through them, the voltage drop being
measured by a voltmeter. In this sense, a precision shunt resistor ”converts” a current value
into a proportional voltage value. Thus, current may be accurately measured by measuring
voltage dropped across the shunt:
