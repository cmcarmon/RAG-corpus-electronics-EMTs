Tisserand's parameter (or Tisserand's invariant) is a value calculated from several orbital elements (semi-major axis, orbital eccentricity and inclination) of a relatively small object and a larger "perturbing body". It is used to distinguish different kinds of orbits. It is named after French astronomer FÃ©lix Tisserand, and applies to restricted three-body problems, in which the three objects all differ greatly in mass.
