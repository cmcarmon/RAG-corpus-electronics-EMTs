Radar sets, oscilloscopes, and computer circuits all use sawtooth (voltage or current) waveforms. A 
sawtooth waveshape must have a linear rise. The sawtooth waveform is often used to produce a uniform, 
progressive movement of an electron beam across the face of an electrostatic cathode ray tube. This 
movement of the electron beam is known as a SWEEP. The voltage which causes this movement is 
known as SWEEP VOLTAGE and the circuit which produces this voltage is the SWEEP GENERATOR, 
or TIME-BASE GENERATOR. Most common types of time-base generators develop the sawtooth 
waveform by using some type of switching action with either the charge or discharge of an RC or RL 
circuit.
