There are two basic types of Individual movements—Shomate and Rainbow. Shomate movements are similar in concept to Howell movements for pairs—for smaller numbers of tables, a single individual is stationary and all other players move from place to place, sitting at different tables/positions each round. Rainbow movements are similar in concept to Mitchell movements. A key difference for Rainbow movements is that they require the number of tables to be a prime number, and there must be at least 5 tables. In a Rainbow movement, North players remain stationary throughout the game. All other players move after each round. Typically, boards move to the next lower table; South players move to the next higher table; East players move to the 2nd next higher tables (for example, moving from table 1 to table 3); and West players move to the 2nd lower table (for example, moving from table 3 to 1). It is common for the player moving two tables lower to carry boards to the next lower table on the way to their next seat. In a rainbow movement, if it is desired to increase the number of players a person has played with and against, this can be accomplished by having players at each table change positions at the same table within a round. For example, if the movement calls for two boards per round, after playing one board, the South and West players at each table could exchange seats for the 2nd board. If this is done, the players must remember to move back to their original position when moving at the end of the round. In a movement with 3 boards per round, East, South, and West can move clockwise after each board (skipping the North seat).
