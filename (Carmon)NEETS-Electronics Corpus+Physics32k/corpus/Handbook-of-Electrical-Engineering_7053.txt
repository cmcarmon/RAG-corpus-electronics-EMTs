• Assume a simple distribution and design an appropriate code for it. Use this code on the real source. If
an estimated distribution pˆ  is used when in fact the true distribution is p, then the average length of the
x p(x) log [p(x)/ pˆ(x)].  The second term, which is denoted D(p** pˆ ) is
code is lower bounded by H(X) + (
called the relative entropy or the Kullback Leibler distance between the two distributions.
