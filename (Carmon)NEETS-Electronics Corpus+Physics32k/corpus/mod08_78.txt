Figure 1-7 shows a simple class C amplifier. Notice that only a small portion of the input signal is 
present in the output signal. Since the transistor does not conduct except during a small portion of the 
input signal, this is the most efficient amplifier. It also has the worst fidelity. The output signal bears very 
little resemblance to the input signal.
