Given the difﬁculty in knowing a priori all timing contexts
of an integrated circuit, a preferred solution may be to require
that all I/O registers are clocked at the same time (zero skew).
More speciﬁcally, all possible explicit clock delay requirements
for registers in the circuit fall
into one of the following
categories:
