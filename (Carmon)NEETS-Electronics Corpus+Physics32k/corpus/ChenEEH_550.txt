Figure 7.1(A) shows the cross-section of a typical power diode.
A p-n junction is formed when an n-type region in a semicon-
ductor crystal abuts a p-type region in the same crystal. Recti-
Ô¨Åcation properties of the device result from the presence of two
types of carriers in a semiconductor: electrons and holes.
Power devices are required to block high voltage when the
anode is biased negative with respect to the cathode. Applica-
tion of a reverse bias removes carriers from the junction and
creates a depletion region devoid of majority carriers. The
width of the depletion layer depends on the applied bias, VR,
and doping of the region, ND, as:
