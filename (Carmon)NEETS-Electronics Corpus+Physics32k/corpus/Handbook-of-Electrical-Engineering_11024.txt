Muscular dystrophy is a degenerative disease of muscle ﬁbers in which there is atrophy of some ﬁbers, swelling
in  others,  and  an  increase  in  sarcolemmal  and  connective  tissue  with  the  deposition  of  fat.  Insertion  of  the
needle electrode elicits a vigorous burst of short-duration, high-frequency action potentials. Typically at rest
there are no ﬁbrillation potentials. With voluntary contraction, the action potentials are short in duration, high
in  frequency,  and  produce  a  whirring  sound  in  the  loudspeaker.  As  fatigue  supervenes,  the  frequency  and
amplitude decrease.
