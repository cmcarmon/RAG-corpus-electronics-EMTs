Perhaps the concept of the relationship of amplifier-amplification-amplitude will be clearer if you 
consider a parallel situation (an analogy). A magnifying glass is a magnifier. As such, it provides 
magnification which is an increase in the magnitude (size) of an object. This relationship of magnifier-
magnification-magnitude is the same as the relationship of amplifier-amplification-amplitude. The 
analogy is true in one other aspect as well. The magnifier does not change the object that is being 
magnified; it is only the image that is larger, not the object itself. With the amplifier, the output signal 
differs in amplitude from the input signal, but the input signal still exists unchanged. So, the object (input 
signal) and the magnifier (amplifier) control the image (output signal).
