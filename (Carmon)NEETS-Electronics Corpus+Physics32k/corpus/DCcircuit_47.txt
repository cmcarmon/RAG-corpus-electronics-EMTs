While the normal motion of ”free” electrons in a conductor is random, with no particular
direction or speed, electrons can be inﬂuenced to move in a coordinated fashion through a
conductive material. This uniform motion of electrons is what we call electricity, or electric
current. To be more precise, it could be called dynamic electricity in contrast to static electricity,
which is an unmoving accumulation of electric charge. Just like water ﬂowing through the
