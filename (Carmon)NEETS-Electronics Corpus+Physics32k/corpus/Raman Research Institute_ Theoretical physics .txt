The theoretical physics activity in the institute has centred on relativity and gravity, quantum theory, and optics. The current activity in gravitation centres on two themes, gravitational radiation and quantum gravity. Gravitation is known to be the weakest of all known forces of nature, but it dominates all structure and motion on the astronomical scale because of its attractive universality, its long range and the fact that matter on the large scale is essentially neutral. The correct theory of gravitation is now believed to be Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. One of the fundamental predictions of General Theory of Relativity is that of gravitational waves — waves of distortion of spacetime itself - propagating at a finite speed of light. This replaces the Newtonian gravitations forces which was instantaneous. Such waves are expected to be emitted when, for example, two massive inspiralling stars tend to coalesce under their mutual gravitations attraction. Accurate calculation of this gravitational radiation — its waveform — has been one of the major research programmes of the theoretical physics group at the institute. Their work is expected to be a crucial input towards its eventual detection.
Another major activity of the theoretical physics group has been in studying propagation of light waves in certain types of liquid crystals and minerals and their associated polarization phenomenon. RRI has been a pioneer in this field of study which was actually initiated by one of Raman's research students, Pancharatnam.
