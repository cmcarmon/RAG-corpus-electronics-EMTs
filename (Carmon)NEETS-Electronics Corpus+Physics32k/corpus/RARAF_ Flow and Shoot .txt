The Flow and Shoot microbeam system allows for controlled transport of cells through a microfluidic channel which intersects with the point and shoot microbeam. A high speed camera allows for dynamic targeting of the flowing cells with flow rates of 1â€“10 mm/s, allowing for total throughput upwards of 100,000 cells per hour.
