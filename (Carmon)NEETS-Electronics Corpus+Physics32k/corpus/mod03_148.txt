In figure 1-28(A), a voltmeter with a range of 10 volts and a resistance of 1 kilohm (R2) is connected
in parallel to resistor R1. The meter has .01 ampere of current (full-scale deflection) and indicates 10
volts. In figure 1-28(B), the voltage has been increased to 100 volts. This is more than the meter can
measure. A 9 kilohm resistor (R3) is connected in series with the meter (R2). The meter (R 2) now has .01
ampere of current (full-scale deflection). But since R3 has increased the voltage capability of the meter,
the meter indicates 100 volts. R3 has changed the range of the meter.
