Because the bottom side of the circuit is Ô¨Årmly connected to ground through the grounding
point on the lower-left of the circuit, the lower conductor of the circuit is made electrically
common with earth ground. Since there can be no voltage between electrically common points,
there will be no voltage applied across the person contacting the lower wire, and they will
not receive a shock. For the same reason, the wire connecting the circuit to the grounding
rod/plates is usually left bare (no insulation), so that any metal object it brushes up against
will similarly be electrically common with the earth.
