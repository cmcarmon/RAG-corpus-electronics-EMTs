Reciprocal length or inverse length is a measurement used in several branches of science and mathematics. As the reciprocal of length, common units used for this measurement include the reciprocal metre or inverse metre (m−1), the reciprocal centimetre or inverse centimetre (cm−1), and, in optics, the dioptre.
Quantities measured in reciprocal length include:
absorption coefficient or attenuation coefficient, in materials science
curvature of a line, in mathematics
gain, in laser physics
magnitude of vectors in reciprocal space, in crystallography
more generally any spatial frequency e.g. in cycles per unit length
optical power of a lens, in optics
rotational constant of a rigid rotor, in quantum mechanics
wavenumber, or magnitude of a wavevector, in spectroscopy
density of a linear feature in hydrology and other fields; see kilometre per square kilometre
