The received signal in a mobile radio environment travels
from the transmitter to the receiver over many paths. The
signal thus fades in and out and undergoes distortion because
of the multipath nature of the channel. For a transmitted sig-
nal s(t) ¼ a(t ) cos (vt þ u(t)), we can represent the received
signal, r(t ), as:
