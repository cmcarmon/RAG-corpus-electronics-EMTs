In  a  low-power  CMOS  digital  system,  the  dissipation  of  a  light-emitting  diode  (LED)  or  other  comparable
display technology can dominate the total system’s power requirements. In such circumstances the low-power
dissipation advantage of CMOS technology can be completely lost. This is the situation in which liquid-crystal
display  (LCD)  technology  must  be  used.  The  LED  (or  other  active  system,  such  as  a  plasma  or  vacuum
ﬂuorescent display) emits optical power supplied (comparatively inefﬁciently) by the system battery or other
source. The passive LCD is fundamentally different in that the optical power is supplied externally (by sunlight
or  room  lighting  typically)  and  the  system  source  need  supply  only  the  relatively  minute  amount  of  power
(microwatts per square centimeter) required to change the device’s reﬂective optical properties.
