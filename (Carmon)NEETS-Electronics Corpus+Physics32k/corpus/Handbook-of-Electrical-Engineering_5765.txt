Power  system  stability: The  property  of  a  power  system  that  enables  it  to  remain  in  a  state  of  operating
equilibrium under normal operating conditions and to converge to another acceptable state of equilib-
rium after being subjected to a disturbance. Instability occurs when the above is not true or when the
system loses synchronism between generators and between generators and loads.
