1.7.1 TV Picture Tube
One important application of the motion of electrons is found in both
the transmission and reception of TV signals. At the transmission end,
a  TV camera  reduces  a  scene  from  an  optical  image  to  an  electrical
signal.  Scanning  is  accomplished  with  a  thin  beam  of  electrons  in  an
iconoscope camera tube.
