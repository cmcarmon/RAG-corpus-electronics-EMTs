Figure 88.6 shows the structure of a complex interleaved memory system. In such a system, each bank is set
up to operate on its own, independent of the operation of the other banks. For example, bank 1 could carry
out a read operation on a particular memory address, and bank 2 carries out a write operation on a completely
unrelated memory address. (Contrast this with the operation in a simple interleaved memory where all banks
are  carrying  out  the  same  operation,  read  or  write,  and  the  locations  accessed  within  each  bank  represent  a
contiguous  block  of  memory.)  Complex  interleaving  is  accomplished  by  providing  an  address  latch  and  a
read/write command line for each bank. The memory controller handles the overall operation of the interleaved
memory. The processing unit submits the memory request to the memory controller, which determines which
bank needs to be accessed. The controller then determines if the bank is busy (by monitoring a busy line for
