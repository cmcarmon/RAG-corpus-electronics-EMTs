Switch the signal generator on and set the output to 
2 mV  peak-to-peak  (707  µV  RMS)  at  455  kHz, 
unmodulated.  Connect 
the  oscilloscope  (using 
macthed  probes)  to  display  the  RF  output  on 
Channel 1 (or Y1) and the demodulated output on 
Channel  2  (or  Y2).  The  oscilloscope  timebase 
should be set to 1 µs/cm whilst the Channel 1 and 2 
gain  settings  should  both  be  set  to  100  mV/cm.  
The Channel 1 input should be set to AC whilst the 
Channel 2 input should be set to DC. 
  Display the waveforms produced and sketch two 
or three cycles of both waveforms using the layout
