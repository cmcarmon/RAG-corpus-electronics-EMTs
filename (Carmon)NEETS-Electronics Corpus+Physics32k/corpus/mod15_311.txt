Gyro action may be summarized as follows: A spinning gyro tends to keep its axis pointing in the 
same direction. This is called RIGIDITY. If you apply a force that tends to change the direction of the 
spin axis, the axis will move at a right angle to the direction of the applied force. The direction of 
precession will be 90ยบ clockwise from the applied force if the rotor is spinning clockwise (when viewed 
from the "free" end of the rotor's axis); if the rotor is spinning counterclockwise, the precession will be 
90ยบ counterclockwise. If the axis is horizontal, and you try to tilt it, the axis will turn. If the axis is 
horizontal, and you try to turn it, the axis will tilt. This second characteristic of a gyro is called 
PRECESSION.
