determines  linearized,  small-signal  models  for  all 
of the non-linear devices in the circuit (e.g. diodes 
and transistors).  The resultant linear circuit is then 
analysed over a user-specified range of frequencies.  
The desired output of an AC small-signal analysis 
is  usually  a 
transfer  function  (voltage  gain, 
transimpedance,  etc.).    If  the  circuit  has  only  one 
AC input, it is convenient to set that input to unity 
and  zero  phase,  so  that  output  variables  have  the 
same  value  as  the  transfer  function  of  the  output 
variable with respect to the input.
