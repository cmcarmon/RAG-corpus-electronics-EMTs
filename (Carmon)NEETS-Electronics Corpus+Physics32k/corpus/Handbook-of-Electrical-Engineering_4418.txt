Five different types (Fig. 42.26) of basic cable designs are currently in use: (a) loose tube, (b) ﬂuted, (c) ribbon,
(d) stranded, and (e) Lightpack Cable. The loose tube design was pioneered by Siemens in Germany. Up to
10 ﬁbers are enclosed in a loose tube, which is ﬁlled with a soft ﬁlling compound. Since the ﬁbers are relatively
free to take the minimum energy conﬁguration, the microbending losses are avoided. Several of these buffered
loose tube units are stranded around a central glass-resin support member. Aramid yarns are stranded on the
cable core to provide strength members (for pulling through ducts), with a ﬁnal polyethylene sheath on the
outside. The stranding lay length and pitch radius are calculated to permit tensile strain on the cable up to the
rated force and to permit cooling down to the rated low temperature without affecting the ﬁber attenuation.
