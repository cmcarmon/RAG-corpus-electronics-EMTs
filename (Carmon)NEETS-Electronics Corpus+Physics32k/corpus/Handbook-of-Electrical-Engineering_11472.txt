Prices and Availability
The detectors described in this section are available commercially. Their prices vary widely, depending on type,
size, and performance. Room-temperature semiconductor detectors range from a few hundred dollars for small,
low-resolution devices to over $1000 for large, high-resolution devices. Because of the dynamic nature of wide
bandgap detector technology, buyer guides should be consulted for the latest price and availability information.
Pricing of coaxial HPGe detectors is based largely on their gamma-ray efﬁciency, which is speciﬁed relative
to a 3 in. × 3 in. sodium iodide scintillator at 1.33 MeV. Coaxial detectors are available with relative efﬁciencies
up to about 150% with cost in the area of several hundred dollars per percent efﬁciency. Planar HPGe detectors
are  normally  less  expensive  than  coaxial  designs.  In  either  case,  the  price  includes  the  cryostat,  dewar,  and
preampliﬁer.  Cryogenic  silicon  detectors  are  available  in  areas  up  to  several  tens  of  square  millimeters.  Cost
ranges to over $10,000 depending on size, performance, and complexity of design.
