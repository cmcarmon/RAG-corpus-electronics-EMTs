In hyperbolic geometry rectangles do not exist. The sum of the angles of a quadrilateral in hyperbolic geometry is always less than 4 right angles (see Lambert quadrilateral). Also in hyperbolic geometry there are no equidistant lines (see hypercycles). This all has influences on the coordinate systems.
There are however different coordinate systems for hyperbolic plane geometry. All are based on choosing a real (non ideal) point (the Origin) on a chosen directed line (the x-axis) and after that many choices exist.
