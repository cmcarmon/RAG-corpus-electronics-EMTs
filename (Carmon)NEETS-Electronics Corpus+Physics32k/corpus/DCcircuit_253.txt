This problem is especially dangerous if the victim contacts an energized conductor with his
or her hands. The forearm muscles responsible for bending ﬁngers tend to be better developed
than those muscles responsible for extending ﬁngers, and so if both sets of muscles try to con-
tract because of an electric current conducted through the person’s arm, the ”bending” muscles
will win, clenching the ﬁngers into a ﬁst. If the conductor delivering current to the victim faces
the palm of his or her hand, this clenching action will force the hand to grasp the wire ﬁrmly,
thus worsening the situation by securing excellent contact with the wire. The victim will be
completely unable to let go of the wire.
