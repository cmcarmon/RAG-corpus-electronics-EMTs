In gamma-ray applications where energy resolution is the primary concern, thinner devices that minimize
charge trapping are often utilized, although procedures have been developed to mitigate many of the thickness
and area limitations. Two general approaches have been developed to mitigate the effects of incomplete hole
collection. Those approaches are based on electronic pulse processing via ancillary circuitry or novel electrode
structures that achieve monopolar (electron transport only) operation. These methods have been particularly
successful with CZT and CT devices. CZT- and CT-based devices incorporating such technology are available
in  commercial  products.  In  CZT,  for  example,  1.5  ×  1.5 ×  0.8  cm3  detectors  (electron  only  collection)  are
available with 3% resolution at 662 KeV. Somewhat better resolution can be obtained with smaller devices. For
example,  1  ×  1  ×  0.5  cm3  detectors,  operated  in  the  electron-only  mode,  provide  2%  at  662 KeV.  Similarly,
cylindrical  detectors  6  mm  in  diameter  and  5 mm  high  provide  about  1%  resolution  at  662 KeV. An  energy
spectrum obtained with a typical CZT spectrometer obtained with a 137Cs source is shown in Fig. 116.16.
