The Beam Matrix Flat CRT [Tully, 1994]
This ﬂat panel CRT combines electron beams provided by a hot cathode, like a conventional CRT, and beam
modulation and addressing thanks to a matrix of conductive metallic rows and columns. The electron beam
generated impinges on a ﬂuorescent screen identical to that of a standard CRT.
