The worst power failure in history occurred on Tuesday evening, November 9, 1965. At
the height of the rush hour, complete darkness descended, and practically everything came to a
standstill over an area of 83,000 square miles. About 30 million people were affected in eight
states and part of Canada. The system involved was the Canadianâ€“United States eastern power
complex (CANUSE).
