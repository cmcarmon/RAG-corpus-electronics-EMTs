The performance of solid state power ampliﬁers is shown in Fig. 43.4. Currently, IMPATT and Gunn diodes
provide maximum power above 10 GHz, whereas bipolar junction transistor and MESFET technologies offer
the  most  promise  to  generate  higher  power  levels  below  10  GHz.  In  particular,  IMPATT  devices  have  been
operated over the complete millimeter wave band and have shown good continuous wave (CW) and pulsed
power efﬁciency and reliability.
