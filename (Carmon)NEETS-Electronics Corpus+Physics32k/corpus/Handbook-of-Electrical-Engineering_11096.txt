A PEMF signal (similar to B in Table 113.2) has also been used experimentally to arrest osteonecrosis (bone
death possibly due to vascular impairment or toxic agents) of the femoral head. Application for 8 h/day over
12 months gave substantially better results than the standard surgical (decompression) treatment [Aaron and
Steinberg, 1991].
