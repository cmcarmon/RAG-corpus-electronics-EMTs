The inverse scattering problem is to reconstruct or recover
some physical and/or geometric properties of an object from
the measured scattered Ô¨Åeld under the illumination of an
incident wave. The reconstructed information of interest in-
cludes, for instance, the dielectric constant distribution and the
shape or structure. The interrogating or probing radiation can
be an electromagnetic wave (e.g., microwave, optical wave, and
X-ray), an acoustic wave, or some other waves. The problem of
inverse scattering is important when details about the structure
and composition of an object are required but can not be
ascertained from measurements made in situ.
