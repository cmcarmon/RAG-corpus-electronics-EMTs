A generic circuit element places a constraint between the classic variables of a circuit: voltage and current.
Voltage is electric potential and represents the “push” that drives electric charge from one place to another.
What causes charge to move is a physical separation between positive and negative charge. A battery
generates, through electrochemical means, excess positive charge at one terminal and negative charge at the
other, creating an electric ﬁeld. Voltage is deﬁned across a circuit element, with the positive sign denoting
a positive voltage drop across the element. When a conductor connects the positive and negative potentials,
current ﬂows, with positive current indicating that positive charge ﬂows from the positive terminal to the
negative. Electrons comprise current ﬂow in many cases. Because electrons have a negative charge, electrons
move in the opposite direction of positive current ﬂow: Negative charge ﬂowing to the right is equivalent to
positive charge moving to the left.
