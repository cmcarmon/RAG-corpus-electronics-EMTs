The left-hand side of Figure 6.16 shows the corresponding abstract
inverter with the power connections, and the right-hand side shows the inverter
abstraction as we know it with implicit power connections. Notice that the
inverter abstraction hides the internal circuit details and provides a simple usage
model to the user of the inverter logic gate. The internal details are irrelevant
to the gate-level logic designer.7
