The first McIntyre System, the Page–McIntyre system, also known as the McIntyre Final Four System, was adopted by the VFL in 1931, after using three systems since its foundation in 1897, the major system and predecessor to the Page–McIntyre system being the "amended Argus system" that had operated from 1907 to 1923 and 1925 to 1930.
McIntyre also devised the McIntyre Final Five System for the VFL for 1972, the McIntyre Final Six System for 1991 (which was revised for 1992) and the McIntyre Final Eight System for the 1994 season.
The AFL and its fans grew dissatisfied with some of the outcomes the McIntyre Final Eight system might allow, and replaced it with another final eight system in 2000.
