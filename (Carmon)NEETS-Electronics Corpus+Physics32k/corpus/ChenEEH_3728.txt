for any i0, j0, i0, j0, iN, and jN , such that 0  i0, i0, iN  I and
0  j0, j0, jN  J ; the  denotes concatenation of the path
segments. In words, the BOP asserts that the best path from
node (i0, j0) to node (iN , jN ) that includes node (i0, j0) is
obtained by concatenating the best paths from (i0, j0) to
(i0, j0) and from (i0, j0) to (iN , jN ).
