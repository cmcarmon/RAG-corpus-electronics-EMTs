Pulsewidth Modulation Converter DC Machine Drive
Four-quadrant speed control of a dc drive is also possible using an H-bridge pulsewidth modulation (PWM)
converter as shown in Fig. 30.42. Such drives (using a permanent magnet dc motor) are popular in low-power
applications, such as robotic and instrumentation drives. The dc source can be a battery or may be obtained
from ac supply through a diode rectiﬁer and ﬁlter. With PWM operation, the drive response is very fast and
the armature current ripple is small, giving less harmonic heating and torque pulsation. Four-quadrant oper-
ation can be summarized as follows:
