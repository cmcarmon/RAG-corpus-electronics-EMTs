Another  approach  to  determining  the  probability  of  system  failure  is  to  use  a  Markov  model  of  the  system,
rather than the combinatorial methods outlined previously. Markov models involve the deÔ¨Åning of system states
and state transitions. The mathematics of Markov modeling are well beyond the scope of this brief introduction,
but most engineering mathematics textbooks will cover the technique.
