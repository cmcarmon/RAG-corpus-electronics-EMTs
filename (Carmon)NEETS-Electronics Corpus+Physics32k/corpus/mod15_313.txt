The gyro shown in figure 3-5 is a basic, universally mounted gyro, sometimes called a free gyro. Its 
components are rotor, inner gimbal, outer gimbal, and base or support. Gimbals are devices that permit 
the rotor to assume any position and retain that position when the support is tipped or repositioned. Note 
that in figure 3-5, the support may be moved about all axes without the rotor position being disturbed.
