Formalizing Invariant Properties
Let [M0>v denote the set of all valid marking sequences ex-
tracted from all execution sequences of a given PZ net, and let s
be a valid marking sequence with jsj as the length of the
sequence and s(i) as the ith state (marking) in s:W (a ﬁrst
order logic formula) is an invariant property if and only if
the following holds: 8s: s 2 [M0>!  (8i: 0  i  jsj  (s(i)
j¼ W )), where s(i) j¼ W denotes that marking s(i) satisﬁes
W (i.e., the evaluation of W under marking s(i) yields true).
Thus, a safety property holds in every state (marking) of every
valid marking sequence. The above formulation can be simpli-
ﬁed to the following equivalent version in terms of the set of all
reachable markings only:
