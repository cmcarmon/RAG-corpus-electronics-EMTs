This particular ammeter is an automotive unit manufactured by Stewart-Warner. Although
the D’Arsonval meter movement itself probably has a full scale rating in the range of mil-
liamps, the meter as a whole has a range of +/- 60 amps. The shunt resistor providing this
high current range is enclosed within the metal housing of the meter. Note also with this par-
ticular meter that the needle centers at zero amps and can indicate either a ”positive” current
or a ”negative” current. Connected to the battery charging circuit of an automobile, this me-
ter is able to indicate a charging condition (electrons ﬂowing from generator to battery) or a
discharging condition (electrons ﬂowing from battery to the rest of the car’s loads).
