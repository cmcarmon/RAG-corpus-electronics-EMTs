(12.16)
as the solution for v given that we know v and dv/dt at t = 0. It both satisfies
Equation 12.4 and matches the initial conditions.
While Equation 12.16 is the solution for v, it is not expressed in terms of
the state variables iL and vC evaluated at t = 0, which is often more useful.
To make it so, we must determine v and dv/dt in terms of iL and vC. From
Equation 12.1 we can immediately determine v in terms of vC. Thus evaluating
v(t) at t = 0, we get
