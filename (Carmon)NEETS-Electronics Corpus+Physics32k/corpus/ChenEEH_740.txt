We will now illustrate how the assignment of spare cycles to
the data path can have a signiﬁcant impact on its energy
consumption. Assigning too little indeed introduces an energy
waste in the functional units when implemented in a low-
power setup. For instance, several previous papers (see Chan-
drakasan et al. [1996] and its references) have motivated that
functional units should operate at several voltages. The
number of different Vdds has been restricted to a few speciﬁc
values only because of practical reasons. Assume now that we
either have a single unit that can operate part of the time at a
