KVL, just as was the basic approach presented in Chapter 2. Thus, it introduces
no new physics, and it processes exactly the same information. However, node
analysis organizes the analysis of a circuit in a manner that yields a relatively
manageable problem, and this is what makes it particularly powerful.1
