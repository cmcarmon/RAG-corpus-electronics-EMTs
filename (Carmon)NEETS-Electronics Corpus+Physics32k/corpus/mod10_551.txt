When RL is greater than Z0, the end of the line is somewhat like an open circuit; that is, standing
waves appear on the line. The voltage maximum appears at the end of the line and also at half-wave
intervals back from the end. The current is minimum (not zero) at the end of the line and maximum at the
odd quarter-wave points. Since part of the power in the incident wave is consumed by the load resistance,
the minimum voltage and current are less than for the standing waves on an open-ended line. Figure 3-34,
view G, illustrates the standing waves for this condition.
