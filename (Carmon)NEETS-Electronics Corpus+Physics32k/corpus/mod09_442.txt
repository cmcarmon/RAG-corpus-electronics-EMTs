By selecting the sizes of R and C, you can have a time constant of any value you desire. Further, by 
controlling the time S1 remains closed, you can generate a sawtooth of any duration. Figure 3-39 is the 
Universal Time Constant Chart. Notice in the chart that if 1 time constant is 1,000 microseconds, S1 
(figure 3-38, view (A )) can be closed no longer than 100 microseconds to obtain a reasonable linear 
sawtooth. In this example, C1 will charge to nearly 10 volts in 0.1 time constant.
