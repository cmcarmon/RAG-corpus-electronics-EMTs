Problem 4.23: Jamming
Sid Richardson college decides to set up its own AM radio station KSRR. The resident electrical engineer
decides that she can choose any carrier frequency and message bandwidth for the station. A rival college
decides to jam its transmissions by transmitting a high-power signal that interferes with radios that try to
receive KSRR. The jamming signal jam (t) is what is known as a sawtooth wave (depicted in Figure 4.31)
having a period known to KSRRâ€™s engineer.
