For low-frequency applications, the power lost can be minimized by employing conductors with a large cross-sectional area, made from low-resistivity metals.
With high-frequency currents, the proximity effect and skin effect cause the current to be unevenly distributed across the conductor, increasing its effective resistance, and making loss calculations more difficult.
Litz wire is a type of wire constructed to force the current to be distributed uniformly, thereby reducing Joule heating.
