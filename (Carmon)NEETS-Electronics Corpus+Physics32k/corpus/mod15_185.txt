2. Deenergize the synchro circuit and disconnect the stator leads. NOTE: Many synchro systems are 
energized by individual switches. Therefore, be sure that the synchro power is off before working 
on the connections.Set the voltmeter to its 0- to 250-volt scale and connect it into the circuit as 
shown in view A of figure 1-38.
