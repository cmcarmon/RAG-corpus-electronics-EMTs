Definition
A couple is a pair of forces, equal in magnitude, oppositely directed, and displaced by perpendicular distance or moment.
The simplest kind of couple consists of two equal and opposite forces whose lines of action do not coincide. This is called a "simple couple". The forces have a turning effect or moment called a torque about an axis which is normal (perpendicular) to the plane of the forces. The SI unit for the torque of the couple is newton metre.
If the two forces are F and −F, then the magnitude of the torque is given by the following formula:




τ
=
F
d



{\displaystyle \tau =Fd\,}

where




τ


{\displaystyle \tau }
is the moment of couple
F is the magnitude of one of the forces
d is the perpendicular distance between the forces, sometimes called the arm of the couple
The magnitude of the torque is always equal to F d, with the direction of the torque given by the unit vector






e
^





{\displaystyle {\hat {e}}}
, which is perpendicular to the plane containing the two forces. When d is taken as a vector between the points of action of the forces, then the couple is the cross product of d and F, i.e.
