The number of poles in a switch is independent of the number of throws and whether it is a single or
double break switch. The number of throws in a switch is independent of the number of poles and
whether it is a single or double break switch. In other words, each characteristic of a switch (poles,
throws, break) is not determined by either of the other characteristics. Figure 3-6 shows the schematic
symbols for several different switch configurations.
