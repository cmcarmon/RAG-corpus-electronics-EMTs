The 14-megahertz cw carrier frequency is amplitude modulated by the phase-detected coherent
video. The modulated signal is amplified and applied to two channels. One channel delays the
14-megahertz signal for a period equal to the time between transmitted pulses. The signal is then amplified
and detected. The delay required (the period between transmitted pulses) is obtained by using a mercury
delay line or a fused-quartz delay line, which operates ultrasonically at 14 megahertz.
