When air flows around the wheel wells it gets disturbed by the rims of the vehicles and forms an area of turbulence around the wheel. In order for the air to flow smoother around the wheel well, smooth wheel covers are often applied. Smooth wheel covers are hub caps with no holes in them for air to pass through. This design reduces drag; however, it may cause the brakes to heat up quicker because the covers prevent airflow around the brake system. As a result, this modification is more commonly seen with high efficiency vehicles rather than sports cars or racing vehicles.
