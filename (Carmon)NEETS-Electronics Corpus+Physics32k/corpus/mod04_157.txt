Some common types of hand soldering irons are shown in figure 2-28. All high-quality soldering 
irons operate in the temperature range of 500 to 600ยบ F. Even the 25-watt midget irons produce this 
temperature. The important difference in iron sizes is not temperature, but thermal inertia. Thermal inertia 
is the capacity of the iron to generate and maintain a satisfactory soldering temperature while giving up 
heat to the joint to be soldered. Although it is not practical to solder large conductors with the 25-watt 
iron, this iron is quite suitable for replacing a half-watt resistor in an electronic circuit or soldering a 
miniature connector. One advantage of using a small iron for small work is that it is light and easy to 
handle and has a small tip that is easily used in close places. Even though its temperature is high enough, 
a midget iron does not have the thermal inertia to solder large conductors.
