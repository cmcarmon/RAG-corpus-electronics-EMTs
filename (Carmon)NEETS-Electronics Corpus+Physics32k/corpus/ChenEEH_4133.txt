In minimal shift keying, we replace the rectangular data pulse
with a sinusoidal pulse. Obviously, other pulse shapes are
possible. A Gaussian-shaped impulse response ﬁlter generates
a signal with low side lobes and a narrower main lobe than the
rectangular pulse. Since the ﬁlter theoretically has output
before input, it can only be approximated by a delayed and
shaped impulse response that has a Gaussian-like shape. This
modulation is called Gaussian minimum shift keying
(GMSK).
