Tayy al-Arḍ (Arabic: طيّ الأرض‎ "folding up of the earth" or "covering long distances in the twinkling of an eye") is the name for thaumaturgical teleportation in the mystical form of Islamic religious and philosophical tradition. The concept has been expressed as "traversing the earth without moving"; some have termed it "moving by the earth being displaced under one's feet". It is a concept widely familiar to the Sunnis, Shī‘īs and Sufis, each group having a different interpretation on it.
