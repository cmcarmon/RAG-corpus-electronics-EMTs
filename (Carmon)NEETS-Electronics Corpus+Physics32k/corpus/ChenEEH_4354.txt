The interested reader should look in the more recent jour-
nals and conference proceedings to see other exciting topics
that address algebraic notions. For biomedical engineering, the
prominent resources are the IEEE Transactions on Biomedical
Engineering, the IEEE Transactions on Neural and Rehabilita-
tion, and the annual International Conference of the IEEE En-
gineering in Medicine and Biology Society. The American
Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) has a bioengineering
division with an active publications and conference schedule.
