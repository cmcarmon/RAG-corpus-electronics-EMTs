An electron-resonance magnetron oscillator is operated by the electron transit time required for 
electrons to travel from cathode to plate. This oscillator is capable of generating very large peak power 
outputs at frequencies in the thousands of megahertz. Although its average power output over a period of 
time is low, it can provide very high-powered oscillations in short bursts of pulses.
