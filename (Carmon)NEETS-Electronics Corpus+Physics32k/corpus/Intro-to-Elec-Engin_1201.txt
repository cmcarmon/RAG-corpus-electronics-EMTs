The volt–ampere characteristics of dc compound generators at constant speeds are shown in
Figure 13.4.7. Cumulatively compound generators, in which the series- and shunt-ﬁeld winding
mmfs are aiding, may be overcompounded, ﬂat-compounded, or undercompounded, depending
on the strength of the series ﬁeld. Overcompounding can be used to counteract the effect of a
decrease in the prime-mover speed with increasing load, or to compensate for the line drop when
the load is at a considerable distance from the generator. Differentially compounded generators, in
which the series-winding mmf opposes that of the shunt-ﬁeld winding, are used in applications in
which wide variations in load voltage can be tolerated, and when the generator might be exposed
to load conditions approaching short circuit.
