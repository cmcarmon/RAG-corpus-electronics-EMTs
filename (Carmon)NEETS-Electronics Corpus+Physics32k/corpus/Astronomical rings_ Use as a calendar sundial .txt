When the solar time is exactly noon, or known from another clock, the instrument can be used to determine the time of year.
The meridional ring can function as the gnomon, when the rings are used as a sundial. A horizontal line aligned on a meridian with a gnomon facing the noon-sun is termed a meridian line and does not indicate the time, but instead the day of the year. Historically they were used to accurately determine the length of the solar year. A fixed meridional ring on its own can be used as a analemma calendar sundial, which can be read only at noon.
When the shadow of the rings are aligned so that they appear to be in the same, or nearly the same, place, the meridian identifies itself.
