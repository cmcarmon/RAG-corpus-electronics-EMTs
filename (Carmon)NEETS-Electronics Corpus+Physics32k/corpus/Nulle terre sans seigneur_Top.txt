In feudal law, Nulle terre sans seigneur is the principle that one provides services to the sovereign (usually serving in his army) for the right to receive land from the sovereign.
In the original French the expression means "No land without a lord" though the legal sense might be more "no property without a liege" since it was at the basis of the link between the infeodated or feal and his liege.
