4.4.3 A person, while driving a car in a cyclone and
waiting at an intersection, hears a thumping sound
when a power line falls across the car and makes
contact with the chassis. The power line voltage to
ground is 2400 V. Instinctively he steps out onto
the wet ground, while holding the door handle,
to check out the external situation. Assuming his
body resistance to be 10 k and negligible auto-
chassis resistance, comment on what might hap-
pen to the individual. Would it have been safer
for him to remain in the car until some help ar-
rived?
