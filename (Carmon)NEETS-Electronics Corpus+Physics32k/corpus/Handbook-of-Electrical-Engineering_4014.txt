microwave  heating  apparatus  that  comprises  a  resonant  cavity  excited  by  a  magnetron  has  been
equipped  with  an  automated  tuning  system  (see  ﬁgure)  to  maintain  resonance.  Resonance  is  a
desirable  condition  because  it  maximizes  the  transfer  of  power  to  the  material  sample  that  one
seeks to heat. Typically, the cavity becomes detuned from resonance during heating of the sample because
the permittivity of the sample changes with temperature, altering the electromagnetic ﬁeld in the cavity. A
system like this that automatically compensates for the detuning effect can enhance efﬁciency and produc-
tivity in microwave processing of materials.
