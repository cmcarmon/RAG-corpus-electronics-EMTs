9.2.1 Considering Table 9.2.1, the ﬁrst line has been
reasoned out in the text. Justify the other four lines.
*9.2.2 With vA = vB = 0 in Figure 9.2.1, show that a
guess vX = 2.1 V would lead to a contradiction,
and hence cannot be correct.
9.2.3 Consider the circuit of Figure 9.2.1 with vA = 0.4
V and vB = 0.3 V. Find vX and vF.
9.2.4 With vA = 0.2 V and vB = 4.5 V in Figure 9.2.1,
justify why vX = 0.7 V will be an incorrect guess.
9.2.5 Considering Figure 9.2.1 of the DTL NAND gate
circuit, inquire as to why D1 and D2 are used in
the circuit. (Hint: Consider the third line of Table
9.2.1.)
9.2.6 Consider the DTL gate circuit shown in Figure
P9.2.6. Assume diodes with VT = 0.7 V and the
transistor to have β = 35, VT = 0.7 V, ICEO = 0,
and Vsat = 0.2 V.
(a) For inputs VA = 5 V and VB = 0 V, determine
(b) For inputs VA = VB = 0 V, determine Vo.
(c) Is this a conﬁguration of a DTL NOR gate?
