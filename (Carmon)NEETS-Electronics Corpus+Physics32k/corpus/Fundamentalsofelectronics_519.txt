harmonic distortion calculations. The factor of two in the numerator and denominator arises because we
need to sum over negative as well as positive frequency. Because for real-valued signals, c−k = c∗
k, the sums
over these frequency regions are the same. Clearly, the factors of two cancel. Total harmonic distortion
is most easily computed in the frequency domain. However, the numerator can be computed in the time
domain by noting that it equals equals the square of the signal’s rms value (after subtracting the signal’s
average value) minus the power in the ﬁrst harmonic.
Solution to Exercise 4.8 (p. 108)
Total harmonic distortion in the square wave is 1 − 1
Solution to Exercise 4.9 (p. 111)
N signals directly encoded require a bandwidth of N/T . Using a binary representation, we need log2N
