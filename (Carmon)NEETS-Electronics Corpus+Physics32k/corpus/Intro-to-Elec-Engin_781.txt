Using the transistor switch, logic gates can be constructed to perform the basic logic functions
such as AND, OR, NAND, NOR, and NOT. Since the individual gates are available in the form of
small packages (such as the dual-in-line package, or DIP), it is generally not necessary to design
individual gates in order to design an overall digital system. However, the designer needs to
observe fan-out restrictions (i.e., the maximum number of gates that may be driven by the device),
fan-in restrictions (i.e., the maximum number of gates that may drive the device), propagation
delays, proper supply voltage to the unit, and proper connections to perform the intended logic
function. Gates of the same logic family can be interconnected since they have the same logic
voltage levels, impedance characteristics, and switching times. Some of the logic families are
discussed in this section.
