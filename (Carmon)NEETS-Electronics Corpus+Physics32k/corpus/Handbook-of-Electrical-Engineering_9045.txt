designed to allow billions of heater pulse cycles without failure at a local power density of 500 MW/m2. Also,
very special ink must be used so that very minimal chemistry occurs at the hot interface layer, e.g., so that the
chemicals in the ink do not break down and form a thick carbonaceous ﬁlm over the heater. These carbonaceous
ﬁlms,  when  more  than  a  few  hundred  angstroms  thick,  destroy  the  device  velocity  and  thermal  efﬁciency
characteristics. The ink must also not etch the overcoats.
