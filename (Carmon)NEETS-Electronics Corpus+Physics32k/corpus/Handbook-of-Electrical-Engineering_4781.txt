FIGURE 49.6
Idealized hysteresis curve for typical PZT materials. Many PZT materials display offsets from the origin and
have  asymmetries  with  respect  to  the  origin.  The  curve  shows  how  the remanent  polarization ( YPr) and  the  coercive  ﬁeld
( YEc) are deﬁned.  While  the  loop  is  idealized,  the  values  given  for  the  polarization  and  ﬁeld  are  realistic  for  typical  PZT
materials.
