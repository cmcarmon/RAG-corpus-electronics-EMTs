Applying the above three equations, along with Kirchoﬀ’s loop rule, to AC circuits results
in a set of diﬀerential equations. These diﬀerential equations are linear with constant coeﬃ-
cients and can easily be solved for Q(t), I(t), and V (t). In general the solutions will consist
of a transient response and a steady-state response. The transient response describes the
return to equilibrium after the EMFs change suddenly. The steady-state response describes
the long term behaviour when the circuit is driven by a sinusoidal source.
