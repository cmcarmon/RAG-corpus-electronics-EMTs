approaches correspondence, the stator voltages of the transmitter and receiver approach equality. This 
action decreases the stator currents and produces a decreasing torque on the receiver. When the receiver 
and the transmitter are again in correspondence, as shown in view C, the stator voltages between the two 
synchros are equal and opposite (S1 = 52V; S2 and S3 = 26V), the rotor torque is zero, and the rotors are 
displaced from zero by the same angle (60ยบ). This sequence of events causes the transmitter and receiver 
to stay in correspondence.
