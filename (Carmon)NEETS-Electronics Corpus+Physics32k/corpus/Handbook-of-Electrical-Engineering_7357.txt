In most transducers, the electrical output is varied as a function of changes in the physical parameter. These
electrical changes can be transmitted by wire direct to a control center, data display area, or to a data analysis
section  for  evaluation.  The  difÔ¨Åculties  with  the  use  of  wire  in  many  applications  have  given  rise  to  wireless
telemetry.  In  order  to  transmit  the  transducer  information  through  the  air,  it  is  necessary  to  apply  this
information to a high-frequency electrical carrier, as is commonly done in radio. Application of the transducer
information to a high-frequency carrier is commonly called modulation. High-frequency or rapidly changing
electricity has the capability of being propagated through space, whereas low-frequency or battery, nonchanging
voltage does not possess this ability.
