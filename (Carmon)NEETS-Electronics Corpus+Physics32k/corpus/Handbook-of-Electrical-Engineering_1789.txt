Transform Coding
In transform coding, the video signal f (x,y,t) is subjected to an invertible transform, then quantized and encoded
(see Fig. 17.17). The purpose of the transformation is to convert statistically dependent picture elements into
a set of statistically independent coefﬁcients. In practice, one of the separable fast transforms in the class of
unitary transforms is used, e.g., cosine, Fourier, or Hadamard. In general, the transform coding algorithms can
be implemented in 2-D or 3-D. However, because of the real-time constraints of many video signal processing
applications, it is typically more efﬁcient to combine a 2-D transform with a predictive algorithm in the temporal
direction, e.g., motion compensation.
