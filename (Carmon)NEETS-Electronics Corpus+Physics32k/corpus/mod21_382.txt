The standard time pulse marking interval of 1 second consists of five cycles of a 1,000-Hz tone at 
WWV and six cycles of a 1,200-Hz tone at WWVH. These marker pulses are heard as clock ticks. 
Intervals of 1 minute are marked by a 0.8-second, 100-Hz tone for WWV and a 0.8-second, 1,200-Hz 
tone for WWVH. Each hour is marked by a 0.8-second, 1,500-Hz tone on both stations. Universal Time 
Coordinated (UTC) is announced on WWVH between the 45 and 52.5 seconds of each minute and on 
WWV between the 52.5 and 60 seconds of each minute.
