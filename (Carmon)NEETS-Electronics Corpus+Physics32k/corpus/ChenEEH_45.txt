capacitor is replaced by an uncharged capacitor in series with
an independent voltage source. Similarly, an inductor with an
initial current is replaced with an inductor without any initial
current in parallel with an independent current source. The
following example illustrates the application of superposition
in the analysis of linear circuits.
