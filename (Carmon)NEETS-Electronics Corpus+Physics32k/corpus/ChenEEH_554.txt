Planar diodes are formed by implantation and diffusion of
impurities through a rectangular diffusion window. A cylin-
drical junction is formed at the straight edges of the diffusion
window, and a spherical junction is formed at each of the
corners. The breakdown voltage of practical devices can be
signiﬁcantly lower than the ideal values by the occurrence of
high electric ﬁelds at the device edges. With respect to the
parallel-plane breakdown voltage, VBD, pp, the breakdown volt-
age of cylindrical (VBD, CYL) and spherical (VBD, SP) junctions
with a junction depth xj is given as the following two equa-
tions:
