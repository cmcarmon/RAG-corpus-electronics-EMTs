In a capacitive AC circuit, the applied voltage is 
constantly changing, causing the capacitor to charge 
and discharge. After the capacitor is initially charged, 
the voltage stored on its plates opposes any change in 
the applied voltage. The opposition that the capacitor 
offers to the applied AC voltage is called capacitive 
reactance. Capacitive reactance is represented by XC  
and is measured in ohms.
