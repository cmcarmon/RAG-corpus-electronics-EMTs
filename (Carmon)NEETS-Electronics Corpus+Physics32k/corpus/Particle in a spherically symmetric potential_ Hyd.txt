A hydrogenic (hydrogen-like) atom is a two-particle system consisting of a nucleus and an electron. The two particles interact through the potential given by Coulomb's law:

r




{\displaystyle V(r)=-{\frac {1}{4\pi \epsilon _{0}}}{\frac {Ze^{2}}{r}}}

where
ε0 is the permittivity of the vacuum,
Z is the atomic number (eZ is the charge of the nucleus),
e is the elementary charge (charge of the electron),
r is the distance between the electron and the nucleus.
The mass m0, introduced above, is the reduced mass of the system. Because the electron mass is about 1836 smaller than the mass of the lightest nucleus (the proton), the value of m0 is very close to the mass of the electron me for all hydrogenic atoms. In the remaining of the article we make the approximation m0 = me. Since me will appear explicitly in the formulas it will be easy to correct for this approximation if necessary.
In order to simplify the Schrödinger equation, we introduce the following constants that define the atomic unit of energy and length, respectively,

{\displaystyle \left[-{\frac {1}{2}}{\frac {d^{2}}{dy^{2}}}+{\frac {1}{2}}{\frac {l(l+1)}{y^{2}}}-{\frac {1}{y}}\right]u_{l}=Wu_{l}.}

Two classes of solutions of this equation exist: (i) W is negative, the corresponding eigenfunctions are square integrable and the values of W are quantized (discrete spectrum). (ii) W is non-negative. Every real non-negative value of W is physically allowed (continuous spectrum), the corresponding eigenfunctions are non-square integrable. In the remaining part of this article only class (i) solutions will be considered. The wavefunctions are known as bound states, in contrast to the class (ii) solutions that are known as scattering states.
For negative W the quantity

{\displaystyle \alpha \equiv 2{\sqrt {-2W}}}
is real and positive. The scaling of y, i.e., substitution of



x

{\displaystyle x\equiv \alpha y}

For

{\displaystyle x\rightarrow \infty }
the inverse powers of x are negligible and a solution for large x is

{\displaystyle \exp[-x/2]}

{\displaystyle \exp[x/2]}
, is physically non-acceptable. For



x
→

{\displaystyle x\rightarrow 0}
the inverse square power dominates and a solution for small x is xl+1. The other solution, x−l, is physically non-acceptable. Hence, to obtain a full range solution we substitute

which are generalized Laguerre polynomials of order k. We will take the convention for generalized Laguerre polynomials of Abramowitz and Stegun. Note that the Laguerre polynomials given in many quantum mechanical textbooks, for instance the book of Messiah, are those of Abramowitz and Stegun multiplied by a factor (2l+1+k)! The definition given in this Wikipedia article coincides with the one of Abramowitz and Stegun.
