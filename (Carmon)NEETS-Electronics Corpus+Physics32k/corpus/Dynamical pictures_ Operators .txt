An operator in the interaction picture is defined as

Note that




A

S


(
t
)


{\displaystyle A_{S}(t)}
will typically not depend on t, and can be rewritten as just




A

S




{\displaystyle A_{S}}
. It only depends on t if the operator has "explicit time dependence", for example due to its dependence on an applied, external, time-varying electric field.
