Formulation of MNA equations of nonlinear circuits follows
the same steps as equation formulation for linear circuits.
Consider the circuit in Figure 3.5 with a nonlinear resistor
deﬁned by IR ¼ g (VR) ¼ 0:001(VR)3 and a nonlinear capacitor
deﬁned by QC ¼ q(VC ) ¼ 0:001(VC )3. The current through
the capacitor is given by IC ¼ (d=dt )QC. Both the nonlinear
elements are called voltage-controlled elements because the
current through the resistor and charge on the capacitor are
nonlinear functions of the voltage across the individual elem-
ents. Let the input be a DC source E(t ) ¼ 1 V.
