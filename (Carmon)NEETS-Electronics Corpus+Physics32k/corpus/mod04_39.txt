thickness of the conductor will be 0.001 × 0.375, or 375 mils. Since the width is 4 inches and there are 
1,000 mils per inch, the width will be 4 × 1,000, or 4,000 mils. To determine the cross-sectional area, 
multiply the length by the width; or 375 mils × 4,000 mils. The area will be 1,500,000 square mils.
