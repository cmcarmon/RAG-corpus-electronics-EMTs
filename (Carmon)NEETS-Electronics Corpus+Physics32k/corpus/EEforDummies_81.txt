If you simply provide a conductive path in a closed loop that contains a 
power source but no light bulb, speaker, or other external load, you still have 
a circuit and current will flow. In this case, the role of the load is played by 
the resistance of the wire and the internal resistance of the battery, which 
transfer the electrical energy into heat energy. (You find out about resistance 
in Chapter 5.) Without an external load to absorb some of the electrical 
energy, the heat energy can melt the insulation around a wire or cause an 
explosion or release of dangerous chemicals from a battery. In Chapter 3, 
I explain more about this type of circuit, which is known as a short circuit.
