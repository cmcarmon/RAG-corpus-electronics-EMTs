However, we will ﬁnd the voltage appearing between any two of these points to be directly
proportional to the resistance within the conductive path between those two points, given that
the amount of current along any part of the circuit’s path is the same (which, for this simple
circuit, it is). In a normal lamp circuit, the resistance of a lamp will be much greater than the
resistance of the connecting wires, so we should expect to see a substantial amount of voltage
between points 2 and 3, with very little between points 1 and 2, or between 3 and 4. The voltage
between points 1 and 4, of course, will be the full amount of ”force” offered by the battery, which
will be only slightly greater than the voltage across the lamp (between points 2 and 3).
