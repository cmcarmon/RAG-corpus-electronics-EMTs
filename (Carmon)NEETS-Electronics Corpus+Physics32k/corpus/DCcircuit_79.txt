Any source of voltage, including batteries, have two points for electrical contact. In this
case, we have point 1 and point 2 in the above diagram. The horizontal lines of varying length
indicate that this is a battery, and they further indicate the direction which this batteryâ€™s
voltage will try to push electrons through a circuit. The fact that the horizontal lines in the
battery symbol appear separated (and thus unable to serve as a path for electrons to move) is
no cause for concern: in real life, those horizontal lines represent metallic plates immersed in
a liquid or semi-solid material that not only conducts electrons, but also generates the voltage
to push them along by interacting with the plates.
