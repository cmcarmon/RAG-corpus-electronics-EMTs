Such a steady-state optimal solution exists whenever the system (A, B) is stabilizable. Furthermore, this constant
P is the unique positive-deﬁnite solution of Eq. (100.151) if and only if the pair (A, T) is detectable, where T
is deﬁned as the square-root of Q, Q = T TT. Stabilizability of (A, B) ensures convergence of the cost criterion
integral Eq. (100.149), and detectability of (A, T) guarantees that no unstable part of x(t) escapes integration
as part of the integrand of Eq. (100.149).
