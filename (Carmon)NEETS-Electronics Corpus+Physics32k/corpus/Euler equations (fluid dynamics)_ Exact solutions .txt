In incompressible flow, all potential flow solutions are also solutions of the Euler equations.

Solutions to the Euler equations with vorticity are:
parallel shear flows – where the flow is unidirectional, and the flow velocity only varies in the cross-flow directions, e.g. in a Cartesian coordinate system



(
x
,
y
,
z
)


{\displaystyle (x,y,z)}
the flow is for instance in the



x


{\displaystyle x}
-direction – with the only non-zero velocity component being




u

x


(
y
,
z
)


{\displaystyle u_{x}(y,z)}
only dependent on



y


{\displaystyle y}
and



z


{\displaystyle z}
and not on



x

Arnold–Beltrami–Childress flow – an exact solution of the incompressible Euler equations.
Two solutions of the three-dimensional Euler equations with cylindrical symmetry have been presented by Gibbon, Moore and Stuart in 2003. These two solutions have infinite energy; they blow up everywhere in space in finite time.
