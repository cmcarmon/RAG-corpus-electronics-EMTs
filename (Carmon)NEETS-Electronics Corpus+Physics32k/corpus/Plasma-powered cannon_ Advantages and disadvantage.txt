The advantage of a plasma cannon is that it uses electricity as energy source. The more energy is supplied the faster the gases expand and the faster the projectile is accelerated. This makes it possible to "dial in" any velocity desired and allows the projectile to reach speeds at which it would "outrun" the burn rate of a conventional propellant.
A clear disadvantage of the plasma cannon is its weight. Even a small plasma cannon with only the firepower of an air gun weighs about 20 kg (without current supply). A foot soldier thus could not carry a plasma cannon powerful enough to be useful. It would have to be mounted in a stationary position or on a vehicle.
