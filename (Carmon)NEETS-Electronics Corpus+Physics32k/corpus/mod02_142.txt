In the previous chapter you learned that inductance is the property of a coil that causes electrical energy
to be stored in a magnetic field about the coil. The energy is stored in such a way as to oppose any change in
current. CAPACITANCE is similar to inductance because it also causes a storage of energy. A
CAPACITOR is a device that stores electrical energy in an ELECTROSTATIC FIELD. The energy is stored
in such a way as to oppose any change in voltage. Just how capacitance opposes a change in voltage is
explained later in this chapter. However, it is first necessary to explain the principles of an electrostatic field
as it is applied to capacitance.
