Equation  (44.11)  can  be  solved  numerically  by  the  boundary  element  method  (BEM)  in  which  the  active
surfaces  are  discretized  into  elements.  The  advantages  of  integral  formulations  compared  to  the  standard
differential approach using ﬁnite elements are (a) only active regions need to be discretized, (b) the far ﬁeld
boundary  condition  is  automatically  taken  into  account,  and  (c)  the  ﬁelds  recovered  from  the  solution  are
usually  very  smooth.  Unfortunately,  the  computational  costs  rapidly  escalate  as  the  problem  size  increases
because of the complexity of the system coefﬁcients and because the resulting matrix is fully populated, whereas
in  the  differential  approach  the  coefﬁcients  are  simple  and  the  matrix  is  sparse,  allowing  the  exploitation  of
fast equation solution methods.
