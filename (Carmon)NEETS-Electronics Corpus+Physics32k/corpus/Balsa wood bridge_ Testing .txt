Bridges are usually tested by applying a downward force on the bridge. How and where the force is applied varies from one contest to the next. There are two common methods of applying the test force to the bridge:
By hanging a container (such as a trash can) from the bridge and loading known weights into the container until the bridge breaks. The tester could also slowly add water or sand to the container until the bridge breaks and then weigh the container, providing a more accurate way to find the breaking force.
By using a mechanical or pneumatic testing device that pushes down on the bridge with increasing force until the bridge breaks. If such a testing device is used it is often equipped with a method of automatically gathering force data, such as a pressure sensor or load cell connected to a computer. This approach is more accurate at measuring bridges that have secondary structure that proves to be stronger than the primary structure. This method is also less damaging to the bridge, whose structure usually remains intact since the load is automatically relieved at failure.
Of the two, the hanging container method provides by far the greater dramatic effect. Testing with a pneumatic press or ram is often complete in matter of seconds. Exceptionally strong bridges may take up to thirty minutes to test as weight (a combination of steel weights and sand is often used) is added to the suspended container.
