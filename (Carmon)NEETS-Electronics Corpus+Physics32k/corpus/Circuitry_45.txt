where A is the surface area of the plates (in m), d is 
the separation  (in m), and  (cid:15) is a constant for the 
the  absolute 
dielectric  material  known  as 
permittivity  of 
the  material  (sometimes  also 
referred to as the dielectric constant). 
  The absolute permittivity of a dielectric material 
is the product of the permittivity of free space ((cid:15)0)
and the relative  permittivity ((cid:15)r) of the  material. 
Thus: 
0=(cid:15) (cid:15) (cid:15)Ã—
