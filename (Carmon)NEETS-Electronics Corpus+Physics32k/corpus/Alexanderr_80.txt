Thus, Fig. 2.29 can be replaced by the equivalent circuit in Fig. 2.30.
The  two  circuits  in  Figs.  2.29  and  2.30  are  equivalent  because  they
exhibit the same voltage-current relationships at the terminals a-b. An
equivalent circuit such as the one in Fig. 2.30 is useful in simplifying
the analysis of a circuit. In general,
