When radio or radar antennas are energized by transmitters, you must not go aloft unless advance 
tests show that little or no danger exists. A casualty can occur from even a small spark drawn from a 
charged piece of metal or rigging. Although the spark itself may be harmless, the "surprise" may cause 
you to let go of the antenna involuntarily and you may fall. There is also a shock hazard if nearby 
antennas are energized.
