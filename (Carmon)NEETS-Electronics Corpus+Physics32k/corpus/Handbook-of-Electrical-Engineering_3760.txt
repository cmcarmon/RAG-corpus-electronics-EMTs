The  classical  model  of  a  wave  propagation  presented  in  this  subsection  helps  us  understand  some  basic
concepts of EM wave propagation and the various parameters that play a part in determining the motion of a
wave from the transmitter to the receiver. We now apply the ideas to the particular case of wave propagation
in the atmosphere.
