raised to different potentials (A and C in Figure 2.6). When a
conductor replaces an equipotential surface, all the ﬁelds that
existed in the space that were replaced, or surrounded, by the
conductor vanish. Therefore, the surface of a conductor is a
surface across which the normal D ﬁeld undergoes a jump
discontinuity from the value just outside it to zero inside it.
Accordingly, by Gauss’s law, there must be a surface charge
everywhere a D ﬁeld line terminates on a conductor that is
numerically equal to the strength of the D ﬁeld. Where the
lines are crowded closer together, the charge density is greatest.
Therefore on the surface of a conductor, the following special
boundary conditions hold:
