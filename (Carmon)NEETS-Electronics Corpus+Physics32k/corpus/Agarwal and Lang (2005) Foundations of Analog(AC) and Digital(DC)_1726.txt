Using Equations 12.63 and 12.64 it is now possible to interpret physically
the parameters α, ω◦, and ωd in the context of the circuit shown in Figure 12.15.
−αt produces the decay or damping in vC and iL, hence α is referred
The factor e
to as the damping factor of the circuit. Larger values of α cause the circuit states
to decay more rapidly.
In the absence of damping and the associated energy dissipation in the
circuit, that is for R = 0 and hence α = 0, the circuit states would oscillate at
the frequency
