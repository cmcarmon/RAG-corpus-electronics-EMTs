e x e r c i s e 3.1 Write node equations for the network in Figure 3.102. Solve for
the node voltages, and use these voltages to find the branch current i. To minimize
errors and facilitate answer-checking,
it is helpful to obtain literal expressions before
substituting numerical values for the parameters:
