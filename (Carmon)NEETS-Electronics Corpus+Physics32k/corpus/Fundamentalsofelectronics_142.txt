This result is quite general: sources produce power and the circuit elements, especially resistors, consume it.
But where do sources get their power? Again, circuit theory does not model how sources are constructed,
but the theory decrees that all sources must be provided energy to work.
3.6 Series and Parallel Circuits12
The results shown in Section 3.4 with regard to this circuit (Figure 3.7), and the values of other currents
and voltages in this circuit as well, have profound implications.
