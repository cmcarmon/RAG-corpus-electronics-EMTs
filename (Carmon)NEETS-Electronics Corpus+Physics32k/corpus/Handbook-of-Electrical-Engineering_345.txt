Phasor and Power Diagrams
An interpretation useful for clarifying and understanding the preceding relationships and for the calculation
of power is a graphical approach. Figure 3.22(a) is a phasor diagram of V and I in a particular case. The phasor
voltage can be resolved into two components, one parallel to the phasor current (or in phase with I) and another
perpendicular to the current (or in quadrature with it). This is illustrated in Fig. 3.22(b). Hence, the average
power P is the magnitude of phasor I multiplied by the in-phase component of V; the reactive power Q is the
magnitude of I multiplied by the quadrature component of V.
