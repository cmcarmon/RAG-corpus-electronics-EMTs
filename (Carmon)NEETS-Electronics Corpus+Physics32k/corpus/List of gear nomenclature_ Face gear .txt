A face gear set typically consists of a disk-shaped gear, grooved on at least one face, in combination with a spur, helical, or conical pinion. A face gear has a planar pitch surface and a planar root surface, both of which are perpendicular to the axis of rotation. It can also be referred to as a face wheel, crown gear, crown wheel, contrate gear or contrate wheel.
