Acoustic  waveforms  of  interest  have  a  probability  density  function  (PDF);  for  example,  the  PDF  may  be
Gaussian or in the case of clicking, sharp noise spikes, or crackling ice noise, the PDF may be non-Gaussian.
In addition to being characterized by a PDF, signals can be characterized in the frequency domain by their power
spectral density functions, which are Fourier transforms of the autocorrelation functions. White signals, which are
uncorrelated from sample to sample, have a delta function autocorrelation and equivalently a ï¬‚at (constant) power
spectral density. Ocean signals in general are much more colorful and not limited to being stationary.
