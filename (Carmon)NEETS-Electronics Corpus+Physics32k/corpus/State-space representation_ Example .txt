For a strictly proper system D equals zero. Another fairly common situation is when all states are outputs, i.e. y = x, which yields C = I, the Identity matrix. This would then result in the simpler equations








x

Ë™



(
t
)
=

(

A
+
B
K

)


x

(
t
)


{\displaystyle {\dot {\mathbf {x} }}(t)=\left(A+BK\right)\mathbf {x} (t)}






y

(
t
)
=

x

(
t
)


{\displaystyle \mathbf {y} (t)=\mathbf {x} (t)}

This reduces the necessary eigendecomposition to just



A
+
B
K


{\displaystyle A+BK}
.
