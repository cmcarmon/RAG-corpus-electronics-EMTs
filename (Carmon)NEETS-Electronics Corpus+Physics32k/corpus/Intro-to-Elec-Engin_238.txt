A single-phase source delivers 100 kW to a load operating at 0.8 lagging power factor. In order
to improve the system’s efﬁciency, power factor improvement (correction) is achieved through
connecting a capacitor in parallel with the load. Calculate the reactive power to be delivered by
the capacitor (considered ideal) in order to raise the source power factor to 0.95 lagging, and draw
the power triangles. Also ﬁnd the value of the capacitance, if the source voltage and frequency
are 100 V (rms) and 60 Hz, respectively. Assume the source voltage to be a constant and neglect
the source impedance as well as the line impedance between source and load.
