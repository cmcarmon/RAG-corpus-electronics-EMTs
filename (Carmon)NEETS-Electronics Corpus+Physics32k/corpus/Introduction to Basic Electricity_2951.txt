As described in Chapter 10, the center of the atom 
is the nucleus, which contains protons and neutrons. 
The protons have a positive charge and the neutrons 
have no charge. Electrons orbit around the nucleus and 
have a negative charge. Figure 28-1 shows the  structure 
of the silicon atom. The first orbit contains two 
 electrons; the second orbit contains eight electrons; 
and the outer orbit, or valence shell, contains four 
 electrons. Valence is an indication of the atom’s  ability 
to gain or lose electrons and determines the  electrical 
and chemical properties of the atom. Figure 28-2
