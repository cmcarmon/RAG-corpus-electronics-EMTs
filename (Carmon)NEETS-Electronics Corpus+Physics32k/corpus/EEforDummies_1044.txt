If you use a gauge‐specific tool, insert one end of the wire into the strip-
ping tool, hold the other end with a pair of needle‐nose pliers, and 
draw the wire through the stripping tool. If you use a generic wire strip-
per, you provide the gauge control by how much you squeeze the tool 
around the wire: too much, and you nick the wire; too little, and you 
don’t cut through all the insulation.
