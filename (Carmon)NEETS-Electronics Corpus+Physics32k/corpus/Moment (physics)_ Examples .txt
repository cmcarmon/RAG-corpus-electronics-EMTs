The moment of force, or torque, is a first moment:




τ

=
r
F


{\displaystyle \mathbf {\tau } =rF}
, or, more generally,




r

×

F



{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {F} }

momentum is not a moment, but it does have a moment: the angular momentum is the 1st moment of momentum
The electric dipole moment is also a 1st moment:




p

=
q


d



{\displaystyle \mathbf {p} =q\,\mathbf {d} }
for two opposite point charges or

r


{\displaystyle \int \mathbf {r} \,\rho (\mathbf {r} )\,d^{3}r}
for a distributed charge with charge density



ρ

r

)


{\displaystyle \rho (\mathbf {r} )}

The total mass is the zeroeth moment of mass
The center of mass is the 1st moment of mass
The moment of inertia is the 2nd moment of mass:

{\displaystyle I=r^{2}m}
