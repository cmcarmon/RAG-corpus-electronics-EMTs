Figure 6-2 also shows the relative voltage relationships on the electron-gun elements. The cathode
(K) is at a fixed positive voltage with respect to ground. The grid is at a variable negative voltage with
respect to the cathode. A fixed positive voltage of several thousand volts is connected to the second
(accelerating) anode. The potential of the first (focusing) anode is less positive than the potential of the
second anode. The first anode can be varied to place the focal point of the electron beam on the screen of
the tube. Control-grid potential is established at the proper level to allow the correct number of electrons
through the gun for the desired image intensity.
