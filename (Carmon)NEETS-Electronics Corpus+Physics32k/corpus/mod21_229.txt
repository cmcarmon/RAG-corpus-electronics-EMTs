Using an ohmmeter set to the R Â·  100 scale, measure the resistance between the drain and the
source; then reverse the leads and take another reading between the drain and the source. Both readings
should show infinity, regardless of meter lead polarity. Connect the positive lead of the ohmmeter to the
gate. Using the negative lead, measure the resistance between the gate and the drain and then between the
gate and the source. Both readings should indicate infinity. Disconnect the positive lead from the gate and
connect the negative lead to the gate. Using the positive lead, measure the resistance between the gate and
the drain and then between the gate and the source. Both readings should indicate infinity. Disconnect the
negative lead from the gate and connect it to the substrate. Using the positive lead, measure the resistance
between the substrate and the drain and between the substrate and the source. Both readings should
indicate infinity. Disconnect the negative lead from the substrate and connect the positive lead to the
substrate. Using the negative lead, measure the resistance between the substrate and the drain and
between the substrate and the source. Both readings should indicate a low resistance (about 1,000 ohms).
