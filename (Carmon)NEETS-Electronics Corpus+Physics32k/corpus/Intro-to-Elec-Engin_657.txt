In order to smooth out the pulsations (i.e., to eliminate the higher frequency harmonics) of
the rectiﬁed current, a ﬁlter capacitor may be placed across the load resistor, as shown in Figure
7.2.9(a). As the source voltage initially increases positively, the diode is forward-biased since
the load voltage is zero and the source is directly connected across the load. Once the source
reaches its maximum value VS and begins to decrease, while the load voltage and the capacitor
voltage are momentarily maintained at VS, the diode becomes reverse-biased and hence open-
circuited. The capacitor then discharges over time interval t2 through RL until the source voltage
vS(t) has increased to a value equal to the load voltage. Since the source voltage at this point
in time exceeds the capacitor voltage, the diode becomes once again forward-biased and hence
closed. The capacitor once again gets charged to VS. The output current of the rectiﬁer with the
ﬁlter capacitor is shown in Figure 7.2.9(b), and the circuit conﬁgurations while the capacitor gets
charged and discharged are shown in Figure 7.2.9(c). The smoothing effect of the ﬁlter can be
improved by increasing the time constant CRL so that the discharge rate is slowed and the output
current more closely resembles a true dc current.
