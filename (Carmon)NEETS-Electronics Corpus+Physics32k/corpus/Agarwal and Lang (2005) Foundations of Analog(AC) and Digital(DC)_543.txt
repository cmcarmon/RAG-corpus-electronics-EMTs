As we have noted, there are several ways to make the calculations, so it
pays to examine the possibilities and choose the easiest route. The open-circuit
voltage appears directly in the abstracted circuit, Figure 3.89b. The short-circuit
current can be found from Figure 3.89c, and Rt from 3.89d. By inspection from
Figure 3.89d,
