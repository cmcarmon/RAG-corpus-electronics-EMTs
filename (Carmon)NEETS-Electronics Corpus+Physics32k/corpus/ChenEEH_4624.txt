Gain scheduling is typically performed on an exogenous
scheduling parameter that characterizes the operating environ-
ment. In a missile guidance application, for example, autopilot
gains might be scheduled on temperature, air pressure, Mach
number, or a combination of these. The scheduling parameter
will be denoted by an s-dimensional vector, u, that takes values
in a compact subset, Q  <s, called the parameter set. Asso-
ciated with Q is a signal space known as the parameter vari-
ation set, F Q, that is the set of all continuous functions
mapping <Ã¾ into Q.
The notation u 2 F Q denotes a function in the parameter
variation set; u 2 Q denotes a vector in a compact subset of <s.
Note that both F Q and, for instance, Ln1 represent signal
spaces. Technically, F Q  Ls1 since F Q consists of supremum
bounded s-dimensional vectors that vary continuously in time.
In this discussion, F Q will always refer to parameter signals or
parameter variations; Ln1 will refer to signals in the plant
