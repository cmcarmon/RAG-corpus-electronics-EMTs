Convective heat transfer involves transfer due to the motion of molecules, typically airﬂow over a heat sink,
and depends on the relative temperatures of the two media involved. It also depends on the velocity of air ﬂow
over the boundary layer of the heat sink. Convective heat transfer is primarily effected when forced air ﬂow is
provided  across  a  substrate,  and  when  convection  effects  are  maximized  through  the  use  of  heat  sinks.  The
rules that designers are familiar with when designing THT heat-sink device designs also apply to SMT design.
The  design  team  must  consider  whether  passive  conduction  and  convection  will  be  adequate  to  cool  a
populated substrate or whether forced-air cooling or liquid cooling will be needed. Passive conductive cooling
