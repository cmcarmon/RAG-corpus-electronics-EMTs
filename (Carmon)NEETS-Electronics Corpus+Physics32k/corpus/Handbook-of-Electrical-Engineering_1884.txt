Although  having  a  common  register  ﬁle  is  very  ﬂexible,  there  are  physical  limitations  on  the  number  of
function units that can be connected to a single register ﬁle. A single addition requires three ports to the register
ﬁle:  one  to  read  each  operand  and  a  third  to  write  the  result  back  to  the  register  ﬁle.  Register  ﬁles  are  built
from static random access memory (SRAMs) and slow down as the number of read/write ports grows. As a
result, VLIW machines are typically built in clusters as shown in Fig. 17.29. Each cluster has its own register
ﬁle and function units, with three or four function units per cluster typical in today’s technology. A separate
interconnection network allows data transfers between the clusters. When data held in one register ﬁle is needed
in a different cluster, an instruction must be executed to transfer the data over the interconnection network to
the other register ﬁle.
