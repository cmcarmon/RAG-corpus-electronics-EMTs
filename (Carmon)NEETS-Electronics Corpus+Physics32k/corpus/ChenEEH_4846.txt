Consider Ô¨Årst the network communications. Performance of
a communication network is commonly measured in terms
of
time delays (e.g., due to access delay, message delay,
transmission delays), reliability or accuracy of data, and
throughput (e.g., max data rate divided by the data size).
For control systems, the time delay is the most critical measure
due to stability and performance considerations. To address
the special concerns of control systems, some specialized
protocols have been written that provide for a dedicated
control area network (such as DeviceNet). The alternative
is to use a standard data network such as ethernet. Data
networks typically use protocols (such as TCP/IP) that result
in a nondeterministic transfer of data, as opposed to the
smaller but more frequent data packet transfers conducted by
control area networks. Results examining the use of ethernet
for real-time applications are given in Schneider et al. (2000),
while a comparison of ethernet (using CSMA/CD) to a token
ring bus and to control area networks is given in Fend-Li Lian
et al. (2001). Networks using ATM technology have good
performance with other real-time applications, such as video
and voice, and have good potential for future use in control
applications.
