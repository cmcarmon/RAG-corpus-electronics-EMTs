Mechanical or analog computers are devices used for the computation of mathematical problems. 
They are made up of components, such as integrators, sliding racks, cams, gears, springs, and driveshafts. 
Figure 1-2 shows a typical mechanical computer used by the Navy. These computers are analog in nature, 
and their physical size depends on the number of functions the computer has to perform. In an analog 
computer, a continuing input will give a constantly updated output. This being perfect for target 
information, the Navy uses these analog computers primarily for gun fire control. As systems for naval 
weapons became more and more complex, the need for a different computer was apparent. The functions 
that had to be performed had increased the size of the computer to an unreasonable scale.
