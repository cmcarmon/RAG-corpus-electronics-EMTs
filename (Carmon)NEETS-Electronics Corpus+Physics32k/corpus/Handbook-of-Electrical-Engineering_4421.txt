The tight-bound stranded designs were pioneered by Japanese and are used in the United States for several
applications. In this design, several coated ﬁbers are stranded around a central support member. The central
support member may also serve as a strength member, and it may be metallic or nonmetallic. The stranded
unit can have up to 18 ﬁbers. The unit is contained within a plastic tube ﬁlled with a water-blocking compound.
The ﬁnal cable consists of several of these units stranded around a central member and protected on the outside
with various sheath combinations.
