Figure 4-16 is a functional block diagram of a differential voltmeter. The circuitry is made up of a
reference supply, a resistive divider, a dc input divider, an ac converter, a null detector, and a meter. The
circuitry is interconnected by various switching arrangements when you perform the desired ac or dc
conventional or differential voltage measurements.
