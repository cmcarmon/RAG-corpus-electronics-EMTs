If no suitable tip is available for a particular operation, an improvised tip can be made (see figure 2-
34). Wrap a length of bare copper wire around one of the regular tips and bend the wire into the proper 
shape for the purpose. This method also serves to reduce thermal inertia when a larger iron must be used 
on small components.
