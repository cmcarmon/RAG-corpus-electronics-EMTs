For sufﬁciently heavy doping, i.e., for Nd > Ndc = (0.2/aB)3, the ionization energy is reduced to zero, and the
transition to metal-type conductivity (the Anderson–Mott transition) takes place. In this expression the effective
, where Ei is the ionization energy of the donor state. For silicon, Ndc » 3.8 ·
electron Bohr radius aB = \/
1018 cm–3. This effect explains the absence of freeze-out in heavily doped semiconductors.
