Dc motors ﬁnd wide applications in which control of speed, voltage, or current is essential.
Shunt motors with constant speed are used for centrifugal pumps, fans, blowers, and conveyors,
whereas shunt motors with adjustable speed are employed in rolling mills and paper mills.
Compound motors ﬁnd their use for plunger pumps, crushers, punch presses, and hoists. Series
