The  predictors  can  include  pixels  from  the  present  frame  as  well  as  those  from  previous  frames  (see
Fig. 17.17). If the motion and the spatial detail are not too high, frame (or ﬁeld) prediction works well. If the
motion is high and/or the spatial detail is high, intraﬁeld prediction generally works better. A primary reason
is that there is less correlation between frames and ﬁelds when the motion is high.
