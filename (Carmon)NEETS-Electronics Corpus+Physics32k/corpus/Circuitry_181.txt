3.9   A capacitor of 1 µF is charged from a 15 V 
d.c. supply via a 100 kF resistor. How long 
 
will it take for the capacitor voltage to reach 
 
 
5 V? 
3.10   A capacitor of 22 µF is charged to a voltage 
 
of 50 V. If the capacitor is then discharged 
using  a  resistor  of  100  kF, determine  the 
 
time taken for the capacitor voltage to reach 
 
 
10 V. 
3.11   An  initially  uncharged  capacitor  is  charged 
from  a  200  V  d.c.  supply  through  a  2  MF
 
resistor.  If  it  takes  50  s  for  the  capacitor 
voltage to reach 100 V, determine the value 
of capacitance.
