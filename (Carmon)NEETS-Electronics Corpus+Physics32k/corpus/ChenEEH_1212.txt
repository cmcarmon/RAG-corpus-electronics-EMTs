Analytical expressions are preferred in analyzing interconnect
noise because simulation is always expensive and ineffective to
use with designs containing millions of transistors and wires.
Analytical expressions, however, are not sufﬁciently accurate
and do not consider all of interconnect and driver parameters.
Different design stages have different requirements for accu-
racy of modeling interconnect cross talk noise effects. Many
studies have been conducted to model metal lines and cross
talk effects. For the purpose of the timing veriﬁcation, ideal
ground-based RC or RLC-distributed-circuit models for inter-
connect lines have been widely used (Sakurai). The conven-
tional ideal RC or RLC transmission line model of the IC
interconnects without considering that the following detailed
physical phenomena are not accurate enough to verify the
picosecond level timing of high performance VLSI circuits
(Woojin et al., 2000). These phenomena are the silicon sub-
strate effect, the skin effect, and the proximity effect.
