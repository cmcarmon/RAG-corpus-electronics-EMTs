where A is the amplitude, φ is the phase offset, and ω = 2πf = 2π/T is the radian frequency
of the wave. When φ = 0, a sinusoidal wave results, and when φ = 90°, a cosinusoidal wave
results. The average value of a periodic waveform is the net positive area under the curve for one
period, divided by the period,
