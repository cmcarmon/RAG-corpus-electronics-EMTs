The  dominant  mode  of  a  waveguide  is  the  one  with  the  lowest  cut-off  frequency. Although  higher-order
modes are often useful for a variety of specialized uses of waveguides, signal distortion is usually minimized
when  a  waveguide  is  operated  in  the  frequency  range  where  only  the  dominant  mode  exists.  This  range  of
frequencies is called the dominant range of the waveguide.
