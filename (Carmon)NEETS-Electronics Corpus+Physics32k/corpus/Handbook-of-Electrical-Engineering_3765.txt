where the subscripts t and r, respectively, refer to transmitting and receiving antennas. In Eq. (37.23), P is the
power in watts, G is the antenna gain (dimensionless), r is the distance between the antennas in meters, and l
is  the  wavelength  in  meters.  The  Friis  equation  relates  the  power  received  by  one  antenna  to  the  power
transmitted  by  the  other  provided  that  the  two  antennas  are  separated  by  r  >  2d 2/l,  where  d  is  the  largest
dimension of either antenna. Thus, the Friis equation applies only when the two antennas are in the far-ﬁeld
of each other. In case the propagation path is not in free space, a correction factor F is included to account for
the effect of the medium. This factor, known as the propagation factor, is simply the ratio of the electric ﬁeld
intensity Em in the medium to the electric ﬁeld intensity Eo in free space, i.e.,
