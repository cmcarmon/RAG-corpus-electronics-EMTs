When you use the twt as an oscillator, failure of the tube to break into oscillations when all other
conditions are normal usually indicates a defective tube. In the case of a tube used as a receiving
amplifier, an increase of noise with a normal or reduced output can indicate that the tube is failing but is
still usable. All the general rules applying to klystron tubes mentioned previously are also applicable to
the twt.
