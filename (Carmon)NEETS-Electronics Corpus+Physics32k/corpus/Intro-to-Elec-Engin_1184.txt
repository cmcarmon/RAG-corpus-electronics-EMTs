Applications for Synchronous Motors
With constant-speed operation, power factor control, and high operating efÔ¨Åciency, three-phase
synchronous motors are employed in a wide range of applications. An overexcited synchronous
motor, known as a synchronous condenser, is used to improve the system power factor. Syn-
chronous motors are used as prime movers of dc generators and variable-frequency ac generators.
Typical applications include pumps, compressors, mills, mixers, and crushers.
