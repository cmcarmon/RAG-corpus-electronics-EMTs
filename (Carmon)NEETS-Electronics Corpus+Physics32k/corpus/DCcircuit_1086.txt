The protons in an atom’s nucleus are extremely difﬁcult to dislodge, and so the chemical
identity of any atom is very stable. One of the goals of the ancient alchemists (to turn lead
into gold) was foiled by this sub-atomic stability. All efforts to alter this property of an atom by
means of heat, light, or friction were met with failure. The electrons of an atom, however, are
much more easily dislodged. As we have already seen, friction is one way in which electrons
can be transferred from one atom to another (glass and silk, wax and wool), and so is heat
(generating voltage by heating a junction of dissimilar metals, as in the case of thermocouples).
Electrons can do much more than just move around and between atoms: they can also serve
to link different atoms together. This linking of atoms by electrons is called a chemical bond.
A crude (and simpliﬁed) representation of such a bond between two atoms might look like this:
