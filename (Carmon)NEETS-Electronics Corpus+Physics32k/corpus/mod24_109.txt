Let's assume the light ray or incident ray is traveling through the glass. When the light ray
encounters the glass-air boundary, there are two results. The first result is that part of the ray is reflected
back into the glass. The second result is that part of the ray is refracted (bent) as it enters the air. The
bending of the light at the glass-air interface is the result of the difference between the index of
refractions. Since n 1 is greater than n2, the angle of refraction (� 2) will be greater than the angle of
incidence (� 1). Snell's law of refraction is used to describe the relationship between the incident and the
refracted rays at the boundary. Snell's Law is given by:
