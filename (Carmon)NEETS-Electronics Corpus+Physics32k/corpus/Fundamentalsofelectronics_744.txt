are wrapped about each other. Telephone cables are one example of a twisted pair channel. Another is
coaxial cable, where a concentric conductor surrounds a central wire with a dielectric material in between.
Coaxial cable, fondly called “co-ax” by engineers, is what Ethernet uses as its channel. In either case, wireline
channels form a dedicated circuit between transmitter and receiver. As we shall ﬁnd subsequently, several
transmissions can share the circuit by amplitude modulation techniques; commercial cable TV is an example.
These information-carrying circuits are designed so that interference from nearby electromagnetic sources is
minimized. Thus, by the time signals arrive at the receiver, they are relatively interference- and noise-free.
Both twisted pair and co-ax are examples of transmission lines, which all have the circuit model
shown in Figure 6.2 for an inﬁnitesimally small length. This circuit model arises from solving Maxwell’s
equations for the particular transmission line geometry. The series resistance comes from the conductor
used in the wires and from the conductor’s geometry. The inductance and the capacitance derive from
transmission line geometry, and the parallel conductance from the medium between the wire pair. Note
that all the circuit elements have values expressed by the product of a constant times a length; this notation
