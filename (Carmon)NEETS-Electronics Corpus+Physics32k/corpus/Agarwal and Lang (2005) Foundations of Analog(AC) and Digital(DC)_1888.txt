The numbers clearly show the increasing impedance of the inductor as the frequency is
increased. At the relatively low frequency of 100 kHz, the low impedance of the inductor
causes the amplitude of the response to be similar to that of the input signal (8.5 V versus
10 V). Conversely, at the high frequency of 10 MHz, the amplitude of the response is
much smaller than that of the input (0.16 V versus 10 V).
Thus far, in this example, we computed the amplitude of vo at three specific frequencies.
In general, we can also graph any parameter of interest as a function of frequency.
Commonly, we graph the form of the amplitude and the phase of the transfer function
Vo/Vi as a function of frequency Ï‰ (Equation 13.57). Although this seems difficult to do
by inspection, we will learn a technique for doing so in Section 13.4. A computer
generated plot of the magnitude and phase of Vo/Vi versus frequency is shown in
Figure 13.12. The same magnitude graph plotted on a log-log scale in Figure 13.13
