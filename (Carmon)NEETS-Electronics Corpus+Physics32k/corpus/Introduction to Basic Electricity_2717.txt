Series rL	networks are used as low- and high-
pass filters. Figure 25-3 shows the two basic types of 
filters. The circuits are essentially resistor-inductor 
voltage dividers. Figure 25-3A is a low-pass filter. 
The input is applied across the inductor and resistor. 
The output is taken from across the resistor. At low
