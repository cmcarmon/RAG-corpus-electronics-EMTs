The US Government does not sanction any specific manufacturer that may reduce or monitor deer-vehicle collisions. The investigation and implication of deer-vehicle collision prevention methods remains a responsibility of state governments. Such products are usually heavily tested and studied before being endorsed by them. State organizations such as the departments of transportation or game and fisheries usually handle the investigation of deer-vehicle collision prevention methods and products. State wildlife agencies have much concern for the preservation of deer and other wildlife that become involved in vehicle collisions due to roadway expansion and development.
