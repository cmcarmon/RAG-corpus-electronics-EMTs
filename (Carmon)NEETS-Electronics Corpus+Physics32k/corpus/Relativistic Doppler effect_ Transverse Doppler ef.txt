The transverse Doppler effect is the nominal redshift or blueshift predicted by special relativity that occurs when the emitter and receiver are at the point of closest approach. Light received when the emitter is at closest approach is blueshifted relative to its source frequency. Light from when the emitter is seen at closest approach will be redshifted at the receiver.
Assuming the objects are not accelerated, light emitted when the objects are closest together will be received some time later. At reception, the amount of redshift will be

If the light is received when the objects are closest together, then it was emitted some time earlier. At reception, the amount of blueshift will be

Classical theory does not make a specific prediction for either of these two cases, as the shift depends on the motions relative to the medium.
The transverse Doppler effect is a consequence of the relativistic Doppler effect which can be represented by the following general formula:

{\displaystyle f_{o}={\frac {f_{s}}{\gamma \left(1+{\frac {v}{c}}\cos \theta _{o}\right)}}}

In the frame of the receiver, θ0 represents the angle between the direction of the emitter at emission, and the observed direction of the light at reception. In the case when θ0 = π/2, the light was emitted at the moment of closest approach, and one obtains the transverse redshift

This corresponds to the transverse Doppler effect. The transverse Doppler effect is one of the main novel predictions of the special theory of relativity. As Einstein put it in 1907: according to special relativity the moving object's emitted frequency is reduced by the Lorentz factor, so that the received frequency is reduced by the same factor.
