In the search for methods to produce a voltage of a larger amplitude and of a more practical nature,
machines were developed in which charges were transferred from one terminal to another by means of
rotating glass discs or moving belts. The most notable of these machines is the Van de Graaff generator. It
is used today to produce potentials in the order of millions of volts for nuclear research. As these
machines have little value outside the field of research, their theory of operation will not be described
here.
