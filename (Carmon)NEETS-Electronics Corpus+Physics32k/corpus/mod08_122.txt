Figure 1-17 shows the way in which feedback can be used to provide the maximum output signal 
without a loss in fidelity. In view A, an amplifier has good fidelity, but less gain than it could have. By 
adding some positive feedback, as in view B, the gain of the stage is increased. In view C, an amplifier 
has so much gain and such a large input signal that the output signal is distorted. This distortion is caused 
by the amplifying device becoming saturated and cutoff. By adding a negative feedback system, as in 
view D, the gain of the stage is decreased and the fidelity of the output signal improved.
