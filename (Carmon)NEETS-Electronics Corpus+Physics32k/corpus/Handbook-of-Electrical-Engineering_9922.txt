where  Gc(s)  is  the  compensator  transfer  function,  Gp(s)  is  the  plant  transfer  function,  and  H(s)  is  the  sensor
transfer  function.  The  transfer  function  from  the  disturbance  input  D(s)  to  the  output  is  Gd(s)/[1  +
Gc(s)Gp(s)H(s)]. The function Gc(s)Gp(s)H(s) is called the open-loop function.
