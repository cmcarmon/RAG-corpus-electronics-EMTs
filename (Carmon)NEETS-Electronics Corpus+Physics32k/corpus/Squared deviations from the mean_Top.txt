Squared deviations from the mean (SDM) are involved in various calculations. In probability theory and statistics, the definition of variance is either the SDM expected value (when considering a theoretical distribution) or its average value (for actual experimental data). Computations for analysis of variance involve the partitioning of a sum of SDM.
