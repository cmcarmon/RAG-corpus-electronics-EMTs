1. Split-phase or resistance-split-phase motors: Split-phase motors have two stator windings
(a main winding and an auxiliary winding) with their axes displaced 90 electrical degrees in space.
As represented schematically in Figure 13.2.12(a), the auxiliary winding in this type of motor
has a higher resistance-to-reactance ratio than the main winding. The two currents are thus out
of phase, as indicated in the phasor diagram of Figure 13.2.12(b). The motor is equivalent to
an unbalanced two-phase motor. The rotating stator Ô¨Åeld produced by the unbalanced two-phase
