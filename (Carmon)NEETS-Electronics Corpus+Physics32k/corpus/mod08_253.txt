Hysteresis loss is caused by the realignment of the magnetic domains in the core of the transformer
each time the polarity of the magnetic field changes. As the frequency of the a.c. increases, the number of
shifts in the magnetic field also increases (two shifts for each cycle of a.c.); therefore, the "molecular
friction" increases and the hysteresis loss is greater. This increase in hysteresis loss causes the efficiency
of the transformer (and therefore the amplifier) to decrease. The energy that goes into hysteresis loss is
taken away from energy that could go into the signal.
