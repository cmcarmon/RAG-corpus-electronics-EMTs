The RL circuit may also be used as an integrating circuit. An integrated waveform may be obtained 
from the series RL circuit by taking the output across the resistor. The characteristics of the inductor are 
such that at the first instant of time in which voltage is applied, current flow through the inductor is 
minimum and the voltage developed across it is maximum. Therefore, the value of the voltage drop across 
the series resistor at that first instant must be 0 volts because there is no current flow through it. As time 
passes, current begins to flow through the circuit and voltage develops across the resistor. Since the 
circuit has a long time constant, the voltage across the resistor does NOT respond to the rapid changes in 
voltage of the input square wave. Therefore, the conditions for integration in an RL circuit are a long time 
constant with the output taken across the resistor. These conditions are shown in figure 4-33.
