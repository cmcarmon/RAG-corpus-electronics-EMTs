The master oscillator in an externally synchronized system may be a BLOCKING OSCILLATOR, a
SINE-WAVE OSCILLATOR, or an ASTABLE (FREE-RUNNING) MULTI-VIBRATOR. When a
blocking oscillator is used as a master oscillator, the timing trigger pulses are usually obtained directly
from the oscillator. When a sine-wave oscillator or an astable multivibrator is used as a master oscillator,
pulse-shaping circuits are required to form the necessary timing trigger pulses. In an externally
synchronized radar system, the pulse repetition rate (prr) of the timing trigger pulses from the master
oscillator determines the prr of the transmitter.
