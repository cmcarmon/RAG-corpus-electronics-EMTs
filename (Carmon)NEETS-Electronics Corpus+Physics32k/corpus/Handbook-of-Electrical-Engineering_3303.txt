Charge  Ampliﬁcation. For  semiconductor  photoconductors  like  CdS  there  can  be  traps.  These  are  holes,
which under the inﬂuence of a bias ﬁeld will be captured for a period of time. This allows electrons to move
to the anode instead of recombining with a hole, resulting in a longer period for the conduction increase. This
provides a photoconductive gain which is equal to the mean time the hole is trapped divided by the electron
transit time in the photoconductor. Gains of 104 are typical.
