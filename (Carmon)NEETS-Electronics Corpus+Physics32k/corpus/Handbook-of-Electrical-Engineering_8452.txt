This  system  reserves  the  use  of  all  0’s  or  all  1’s  in  the  exponent  for  special  conditions  [IEEE,  1985;  Pollard,
1990].  So  that  the F  ﬁeld  magnitude  can  diminish  linearly  to  zero  when E = –126,  the  MSB = 1  for F  is  not
speciﬁcally represented in the IEEE system but is implied.
