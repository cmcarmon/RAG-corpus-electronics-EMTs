An innovative feature of the infrared camera shown is its use of highly sensitive quantum-well pho-
todetectors of QWIPS. The greater sensitivity of long wavelength QWIPS could allow physicians to detect
tumors using thermographic techniques; improve pilotsâ€™ night vision to allow better landings; and enable
environmental scientists to monitor pollution and weather patterns with enhanced measurement accu-
racy. Other possible applications include law enforcement, industrial process control, search and rescue,
and military antimissile surveillance.
