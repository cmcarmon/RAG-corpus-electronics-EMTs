The TED consists of a bulk semiconductor, typically GaAs,
that demonstrates the Gunn effect. Contacts are attached at
each terminal. Under speciﬁc biasing conditions, a region of
negative differential resistance (NDR) is formed in a region of
the device. If the electric ﬁeld jumps above the threshold value,
additional carries (both positive and negative) will be gener-
ated, forming a dipole domain. This domain will propagate to
the terminal of the device, where a current spike will be
observed. At this point, the ﬁeld again passes threshold and a
new domain is formed that will again propagate to the termi-
nals. The result is a periodic spike in the terminal current. The
period of the spike is f ¼ L=vd, where L is the length of
the device and vd is the velocity of the domain in the material.
