which is known as the combined Ô¨Åeld integral equation
(CFIE) (Mautz and Harrington, 1978). This combination
results in an integral operator corresponding to the corres-
ponding operator for a cavity with a resistive wall whose
resonant frequencies are complex. As a result, the operator
cannot be singular for a real frequency. The combination
parameter a is usually chosen between zero and one.
