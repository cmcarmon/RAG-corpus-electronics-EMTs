Using wall power to supply higher DC current  
or voltage (not recommended)
The AC power supplied by your utility company can cause injury or death if used 
improperly, so I donâ€™t recommend that you power circuits directly off house-
hold current. And because the vast majority of hobby electronics projects 
run on batteries, you may never be tempted to work with AC anyway.
