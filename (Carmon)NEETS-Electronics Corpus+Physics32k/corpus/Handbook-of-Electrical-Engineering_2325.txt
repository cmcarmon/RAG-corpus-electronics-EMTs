Most of the equivalent circuits for BJTs are based on the Ebers–Moll model [1954] or the Gummel–Poon
model [1970]. The original Ebers–Moll model was a large signal, nonlinear dc model for BJTs. Since then, a
number of improvements have been incorporated to make the model more accurate for various applications.
In addition, an accurate model has been introduced by Gummel and Poon.
