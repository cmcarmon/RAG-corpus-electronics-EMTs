The potential energy is taken to be zero, so that all energy is in the form of kinetic energy. The relationship between kinetic energy and momentum for massive non-relativistic particles is

where p2 is the square of the momentum vector p = [px, py, pz]. We may therefore rewrite Equation (1) as:

where Z is the partition function, corresponding to the denominator in Equation (1). Here m is the molecular mass of the gas, T is the thermodynamic temperature and k is the Boltzmann constant. This distribution of Ni/N is proportional to the probability density function fp for finding a molecule with these values of momentum components, so:

The normalizing constant c, can be determined by recognizing that the probability of a molecule having some momentum must be 1. Therefore the integral of equation (4) over all px, py, and pz must be 1.
It can be shown that:

Substituting Equation (5) into Equation (4) gives:

The distribution is seen to be the product of three independent normally distributed variables




p

x




{\displaystyle p_{x}}
,




p

y




{\displaystyle p_{y}}
, and




p

z




{\displaystyle p_{z}}
, with variance



m
k
T


{\displaystyle mkT}
. Additionally, it can be seen that the magnitude of momentum will be distributed as a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, with



a
=

{\displaystyle a={\sqrt {mkT}}}
. The Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution for the momentum (or equally for the velocities) can be obtained more fundamentally using the H-theorem at equilibrium within the Kinetic theory of gases framework.
