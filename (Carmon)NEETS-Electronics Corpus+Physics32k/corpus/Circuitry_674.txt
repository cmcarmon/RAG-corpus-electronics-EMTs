(a)   At  A,  the  supply  current  is  measured  by 
removing  the  supply  rail  fuse  and  inserting 
 
 
the meter in its place. A suitable meter range is 
 
2 A, DC. 
(b)  At  B, 
 
 
 
(c)  At  C,  the  emitter  current  for  TR4  can  be 
 
measured  by  connecting  the  meter  across  the 
emitter  resistor,  R11,  and  measuring 
 
the 
voltage drop across it. The emitter current can 
 
then  be  calculated  using  Ohmâ€™s  Law).  This 
 
can  be  much  quicker  than  disconnecting  the 
 
 
emitter  lead  and  inserting  the  meter  switched 
to  the  current  range.  A  suitable  range  for  the 
 
 
meter  is  2  V,  DC  (note  that  2  V  is  dropped 
 
across 1 G when a current of 2 A is flowing ). 
(d)  At  D,  the  voltage  at  the  junction  of  R11  and 
R12  is  measured  by  connecting  the  meter 
 
between  the  junction  of  R11  and  R12  and 
 
common/ground.  A  suitable  meter  range  is  
 
 
20 V, DC. 
(e)  At  E,  the  base-emitter  voltage  for  TR2  is 
measured  by  connecting  the  meter  with  its 
 
positive  lead  to  the  base  of  TR2  and  its 
 
negative lead to the emitter of TR2. A suitable 
 
 
meter range is 2 V, DC.
