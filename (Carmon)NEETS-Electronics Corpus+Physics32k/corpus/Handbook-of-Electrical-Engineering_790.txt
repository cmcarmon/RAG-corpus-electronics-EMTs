Frequency response techniques are used in many areas of engineering. They are most obviously applicable
to such topics as communications and Ô¨Ålters, where the frequency response behaviors of systems are central to
an understanding of their operations. It is, however, in the area of control systems where frequency response
techniques  are  most  fully  developed  as  analytical  and  design  tools.  The  Nichols  chart,  for  instance,  is  used
exclusively in the analysis and design of feedback control systems.
