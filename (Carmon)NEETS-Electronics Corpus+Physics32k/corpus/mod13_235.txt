As with all AND gates, all the inputs must be HIGH at the same time to produce a HIGH output.
Donâ€™t be confused if the complement of a variable is used as an input. When a complement is indicated as
an input to an AND gate, it must also be HIGH to satisfy the input requirements of the gate. The Boolean
expression for the output is formulated based on the TRUE inputs that give a TRUE output. Here is an
adage that might help you better understand the AND gate:
