Diode coding 
 
The European system for classifying semiconductor 
involves  an  alphanumeric  code  which 
diodes 
employs  either 
three  figures 
(general-purpose  diodes)  or  three  letters  and  two 
figures  (special-purpose  diodes).  Table  5.7  shows 
how  diodes  are  coded.  Note  that  the  cathode 
connection  of  most  wire-ended  diodes  is  marked  
with a stripe.
