Deﬁnition 6 Dependence Graph
A dependence graph (DG) (Kung, 1988) is a directed graph
GDG ¼ (VDG, LDG), where VDG is a set of nodes in index space
J n and where LDG is a set of edges connecting a pair of nodes, i
and j and i, j 2 VDG if and only if computing of node j depends
on the result from node i. Note that these edges are also called
dependence vectors either due to propagation or computation.
In other words, a DG is a graphical representation of an n-level
nested Do-loop deﬁned in deﬁnition 2. Furthermore, any DG is
&
computable if and only if it contains no loops or cycles.
A DG with its detailed DFG in each node is considered a
