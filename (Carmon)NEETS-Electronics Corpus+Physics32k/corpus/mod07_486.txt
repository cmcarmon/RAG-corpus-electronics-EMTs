C1 reduces the ripple to a relatively low level (view B). L1 and C2 form the LC filter, which reduces 
the ripple even further. L1 is a large value iron-core induct (choke). L1 has a high value of inductance an 
therefore, a high value of XL which offers a high reactance to the ripple frequency. At the same time, C2 
offers a very low reactance to ac ripple. L1 and C2 for an ac voltage divider and, because the reactance of 
L1 much higher than that of C2, most of the ripple voltage is dropped across L1. Only a slight trace of 
ripple appears across C2 and the load (view C).
