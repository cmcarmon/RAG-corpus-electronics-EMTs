Modeling of the Return Stroke
General
A number of return stroke current models are found in the literature from which, if the current at the channel
base  is  speciﬁed  (e.g.,  from  measurement)  along  with  the  model  parameters,  the  channel  current  can  be
calculated as a function of height and time: the Bruce–Golde (BG) model, the transmission line (TL) model,
the modiﬁed transmission line (MTL) model, the traveling current source (TCS) model, the Lin–Uman–Stan-
dler  (LUS)  model,  the  Diendorfer–Uman  (DU)  model,  and  the  modiﬁed  DU  model.  Two  assumptions  are
