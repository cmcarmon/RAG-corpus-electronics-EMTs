Modular Approach
Simulation of larger systems consisting of electric machines can be assembled directly from basic equations of
the individual components and their connections. On a higher level of integration, it will be more convenient
and advantageous to utilize templates of subsystems to construct the full system in a modular manner. Subsystem
templates  once  veriﬁed  can  be  reused  with  conﬁdence  for  studies  that  are  within  the  scope  of  the  models
implemented. The tasks of constructing and debugging a simulation using the modular approach can be much
easier than building the same simulation from elementary representations.
