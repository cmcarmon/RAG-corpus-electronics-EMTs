This is not to say that rehabilitation engineers should shun advances in technology. In fact, a fair proportion
of rehabilitation engineers work in a research setting where state-of-the-art technology is being applied to the
needs of the disabled. However, it is often difﬁcult to transfer complex technology from a laboratory to disabled
consumers  not  directly  associated  with  that  laboratory.  Such  devices  are  often  designed  for  use  only  in  a
structured  environment,  are  difﬁcult  to  repair  properly  in  the  ﬁeld,  and  often  require  a  high  level  of  user
interaction or sophistication.
