Notice that the ﬁgures for speciﬁc resistance in the above table are given in the very strange
unit of ”ohms-cmil/ft” (Ω-cmil/ft), This unit indicates what units we are expected to use in the
resistance formula (R=ρl/A). In this case, these ﬁgures for speciﬁc resistance are intended to
be used when length is measured in feet and cross-sectional area is measured in circular mils.
The metric unit for speciﬁc resistance is the ohm-meter (Ω-m), or ohm-centimeter (Ω-cm),
with 1.66243 x 10−9 Ω-meters per Ω-cmil/ft (1.66243 x 10−7 Ω-cm per Ω-cmil/ft). In the Ω-cm
column of the table, the ﬁgures are actually scaled as µΩ-cm due to their very small magni-
tudes. For example, iron is listed as 9.61 µΩ-cm, which could be represented as 9.61 x 10−6
Ω-cm.
