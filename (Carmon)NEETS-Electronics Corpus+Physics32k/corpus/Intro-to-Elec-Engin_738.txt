Common-Drain (CD) JFET Ampliﬁer
Figure 8.4.2(a) shows a CD JFET ampliﬁer in which resistors R1, R2, and RSS are selected by the
bias design, and capacitors CG and CS are chosen to be large enough to act as short circuits at
frequencies in the band of interest (known as the midband). Figure 8.4.2(b) gives its small-signal
ac equivalent circuit. Analysis of this circuit yields
