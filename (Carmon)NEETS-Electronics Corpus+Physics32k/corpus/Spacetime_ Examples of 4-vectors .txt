Displacement 4-vector: Otherwise known as the spacetime separation, this is (Δt, Δx, Δy, Δz), or for infinitesimal separations, (dt, dx, dy, dz).

Velocity 4-vector: This results when the displacement 4-vector is divided by



d
τ


{\displaystyle d\tau }

{\displaystyle d\tau }
is the proper time between the two events that yield dt, dx, dy, and dz.

The 4-velocity is tangent to the world line of a particle, and has a length equal to one unit of time in the frame of the particle.
An accelerated particle does not have an inertial frame in which it is always at rest. However, as stated before in the earlier discussion of the transverse Doppler effect, an inertial frame can always be found which is momentarily comoving with the particle. This frame, the momentarily comoving reference frame (MCRF), enables application of special relativity to the analysis of accelerated particles.
Since photons move on null lines,



d
τ
=
0


{\displaystyle d\tau =0}
for a photon, and a 4-velocity cannot be defined. There is no frame in which a photon is at rest, and no MCRF can be established along a photon's path.
Energy-momentum 4-vector: As discussed in the section on Energy and momentum,

As indicated before, there are varying treatments for the energy-momentum 4-vector so that one may also see it expressed as



(
E
,



p

)


{\displaystyle (E,{\vec {p}})}
or



(
E

.


{\displaystyle (E,{\vec {p}}c).}
The first component is the total energy (including mass) of the particle (or system of particles) in a given frame, while the remaining components are its spatial momentum. The energy-momentum 4-vector is a conserved quantity.
Acceleration 4-vector: This results from taking the derivative of the velocity 4-vector with respect to



τ

As expected, the final components of the above 4-vectors are all standard 3-vectors corresponding to spatial 3-momentum, 3-force etc.
