Conventional electrical units can be thought of as a scaled version of a system of natural units defined as




c
=
e
=
ℏ
=
1



{\displaystyle c=e=\hbar =1\ }

having consequence:

{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4\pi \epsilon _{0}}}={\frac {\mu _{0}}{4\pi }}=\alpha \ }
.
This is a more general (or less specific) version of either the particle physics "natural units" or the quantum chromodynamical system of units but that no unit mass is fixed. Like n.u. or QCD units, with conventional electrical units any observed variation over space or time in the value of the fine-structure constant, α, is attributed to variation in the Coulomb constant or vacuum permittivity or, since the speed of light, c, is fixed, as a variation in the vacuum permeability.
The following table provides a comparison of conventional electrical units with other natural unit systems:
