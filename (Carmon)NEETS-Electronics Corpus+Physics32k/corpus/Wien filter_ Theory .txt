Any charged particle in an electric field will feel a force proportional to the charge and field strength such that






F
→



=
q



E
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {F}}=q{\vec {E}}}
, where F is force, q is charge, and E is electric field strength. Similarly, any particle moving in a magnetic field will feel a force proportional to the velocity and charge of the particle. The force felt by any particle is then equal to






F
→



=
q



v
→



×



B
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {F}}=q{\vec {v}}\times {\vec {B}}}
, where F is force, q is the charge on the particle, v is the velocity of the particle, B is the strength of the magnetic field, and



×


{\displaystyle \times }
is the cross product. In the case of a velocity selector, the magnetic field is always at 90 degrees to the velocity and the force is simplified to



F
=
q
v
B


{\displaystyle F=qvB}
in the direction described by the cross product.
Setting the two forces to equal magnitude in opposite directions it can be shown that





E
B


=
v


{\displaystyle {\frac {E}{B}}=v}
. Which means that any combination of electric (






E
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {E}}}
) and magnetic (






B
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {B}}}
) fields will allow charged particles with only velocity






v
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {v}}}
through.
