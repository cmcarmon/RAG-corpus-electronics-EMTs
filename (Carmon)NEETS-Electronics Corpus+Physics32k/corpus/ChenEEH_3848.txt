It is noteworthy that the compression obtained in the above
example was achieved without any loss; that is, the input image
could be recovered, without error, from its compressed ver-
sion. This is referred to as lossless compression. In some
circumstances, one is willing to give up the error-free recovery
to obtain larger compression rates. This is referred to as lossy
compression. In the case of images, lossy compression is used
a great deal, especially when one can introduce distortions
with just a low degree of visibility (Watson, 1993).
