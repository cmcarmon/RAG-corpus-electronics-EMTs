Recall that our inverter with characteristics shown in Figure 6.40 satis-
fied this static discipline. Now letâ€™s check out our NAND gate. Figure 6.43
shows the voltage thresholds for the given static discipline superimposed on the
inverter transfer function. As before, let us check each of the output and input
thresholds.
