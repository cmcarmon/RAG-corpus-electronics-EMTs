After reaching its orbit, the radial jets are pulsed to start the satellite spinning. The satellite spin axis 
is orientated to the axis of the earth by means of small axial jets. Velocity jets are used to place the 
satellite in orbit position and provide velocity correction. Figure 4-9 is an example of spin stabilization.
