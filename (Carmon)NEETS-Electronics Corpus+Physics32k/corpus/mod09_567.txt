At time T0 the −25 volt signal applied to the circuit is instantly felt across R1 and D1. The −25 volt 
input signal forward biases D1, and C1 quickly charges to 35 volts. This leaves +10 volts across the 
output terminals for much of the period from T0 to T1. The polarity of the charged capacitor is, from the 
left to the right, minus to plus.
