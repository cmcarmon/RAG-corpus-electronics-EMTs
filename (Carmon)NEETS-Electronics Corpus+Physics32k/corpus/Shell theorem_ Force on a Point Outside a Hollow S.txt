Fig. 1 is a cross section of the hollow sphere through the centre, S with an arbitrary point, P, outside the sphere. PT is the tangent to the circle at T which passes through P. HI is a small arc on the surface such that PH is less than PT. Extend PI to intersect the sphere at L and draw SF to the point F that bisects IL. Extend PH to intersect the sphere at K and draw SE to the point E that bisects HK, and extend SF to intersect HK at D. Drop a perpendicular IQ on to the line PS joining P to the centre S. Let the radius of the sphere be a and the distance PS be D.
Let arc IH be extended perpendicularly out of the plane of the diagram, by a small distance ζ. The area of figure generated is IH.ζ and its mass is proportional to this product.

If now the arc HI is rotated completely about the line PS to form a ring of width HI and radius IQ, the length of the ring is 2π.IQ, and its area is 2π.IQ.IH. The component of the force due to this ring on the particle at P in the direction PS becomes

The perpendicular components of the force directed towards PS cancel out since the mass in the ring is distributed symmetrically about PS. Therefore, the component in the direction PS is the total force on P due to the ring formed by rotating arc HI about PS.

Assume now in Fig. 2, that another particle is outside the sphere at a point, p, a different distance, d, from the centre of the sphere, with corresponding points lettered in lower case. For easy comparison, the construction for P in Fig. 1 is also shown in Fig. 2. As before, ph is less than pt.

Newton claims that DF and df can be taken as equal in the limit as the angles DPF and dpf ‘vanish together’. Note that angles DPF and dpf are not equal. Although DS and dS become equal in the limit, this does not imply that the ratio of DF to df becomes equal to unity, when DF and df both approach zero. In the finite case DF depends on D, and df on d, so they are not equal.
Since the ratio of DF to df in the limit is crucial, more detailed analysis is required. From the similar right triangles,

Comparing the force from the ring HI rotated about PS to the ring hi about pS, the ratio of these 2 forces

{\displaystyle ={\frac {d^{2}}{D^{2}}}}

By dividing up the arcs AT and Bt into corresponding infinitesimal rings, it follows that the ratio of the force due to the arc AT rotated about PS to that of Bt rotated about pS is in the same ratio, and similarly, the ratio of the forces due to arc TB to that of tA both rotated are in the same ratio.
Therefore, the force on a particle any distance D from the centre of the hollow sphere is inversely proportional to




D

{\displaystyle D^{2}}
, which proves the proposition.
