The parabolic reflector antennas previously discussed and the antenna shown in figure 3-13 are 
examples of parasitic arrays. Notice that the reflector in figure 3-13 is not directly connected to the energy 
source. Driven arrays, in which all the radiating elements are connected to the energy source, have 
smaller losses than parasitic arrays while retaining some of the narrow-beam characteristics. Parasitic 
arrays, such as the parabolic reflector, are used primarily as antennas in fire control radars and other 
installations, such as microwave communication systems, that require very accurate (narrow) beams. 
Driven arrays are used primarily as search-radar antennas because extremely narrow beams are less 
critical than low losses.
