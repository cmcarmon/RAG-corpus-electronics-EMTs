The bridge rectifier can operate without a trans-
former. However, a transformer is needed to step up 
or step down the voltage. The output of the bridge 
rectifier is higher than that of either the full-wave or 
half-wave rectifier. A disadvantage is that the bridge 
rectifier requires four diodes. However, the diodes are 
inexpensive compared to a center-tapped transformer.
