Let us now return to applying the basic method to several other circuits. Con-
sider,
for example, the circuit in Figure 2.56, which we will see again in
Chapter 3. What is new about this circuit is that it contains two sources. It
is not amenable to the intuitive method discussed in Section 2.4. Nonetheless,
it can be analyzed by the basic approach presented in Section 2.3.
