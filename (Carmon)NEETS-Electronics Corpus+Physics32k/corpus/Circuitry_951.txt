Laws of indices 
 
When  simplifying  calculations  involving  indices, 
certain basic rules or laws can be applied, called the 
laws of indices. These are listed below: 
 
(a)  when  multiplying  two  or  more  numbers 
having the  same base, the indices are added. 
 
Thus 22 × 24 = 22+4 = 26.
 
(b)  when  a  number  is  divided    by  a    number 
 
  the  same  base,  the  indices  are 
 
(c)  when a number which is raised to a power is 
raised  to  a  further  power,  the  indices  are 
 
multiplied. Thus (25)2 = 25×2 = 210.
 
(d)  when a number has an index of 0, its value is 
 
(e)  when a number is raised to a negative power, 
 
the  number  is  the  reciprocal  of  that  number 
raised to a positive power. Thus 2-4 = 1/24.
 
(f)  when a number is raised to a fractional power 
the denominator of the fraction is the root of 
 
the  number  and  the  numerator  is  the  power. 
 
Thus 25½ = ^251 = ±5
