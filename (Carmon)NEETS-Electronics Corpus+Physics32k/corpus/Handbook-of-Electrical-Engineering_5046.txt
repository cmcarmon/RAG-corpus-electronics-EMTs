Dissipation  factor  (tand): Equal  to  the  tangent  of  the  loss  angle  d,  which  is  the  phase  angle  between  the
external  electric  ﬁeld  vector E  and  the  resulting  displacement  vector D.  It  is  numerically  equal  to  the
ratio of the imaginary permittivity e† to the real permittivity, e¢; alternatively, it is deﬁned by the ratio
of the leakage current to the displacement (charging or capacitive) current.
