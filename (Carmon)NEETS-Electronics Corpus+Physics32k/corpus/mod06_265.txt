One very useful characteristic of the tetrode tube is the relationship between the plate and screen
grid. The screen grid will lessen the effect that a decreasing plate potential (negative-going signal) has on
conduction through the tube. In a triode, when the grid goes positive, the plate goes negative. This
decreases electrostatic attraction across the tube and tends to decrease the gain somewhat.
