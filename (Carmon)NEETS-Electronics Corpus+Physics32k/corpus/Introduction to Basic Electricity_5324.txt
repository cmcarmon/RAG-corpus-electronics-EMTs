The most important document when troubleshoot-
ing a circuit is the schematic diagram. It allows the 
electronics technician to read the circuit like a book. 
It shows not only how the circuit is connected but 
also voltage drops in a circuit. A good schematic also 
shows waveforms at various test points in the circuit.
