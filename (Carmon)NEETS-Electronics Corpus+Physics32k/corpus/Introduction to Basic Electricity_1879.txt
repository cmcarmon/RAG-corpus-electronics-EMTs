When working on a piece of equipment, many dif-
ferent measurements must be taken. To eliminate 
the need for several meters, the voltmeter, ammeter, 
and ohmmeter can be combined into a single instru-
ment called a multimeter. An analog multimeter is 
 referred to as a volt-ohm-milliammeter	(VoM), 
Figure 15-8. A digital	multimeter is also referred to 
as a dMM.
