This  chapter  discusses  the  three  electrostrictive  effects  and  their  applications. A  discussion  of  the  sizes  of
these effects and typical electrostrictive coefÔ¨Åcients is followed by an examination of lead magnesium niobate
(PMN)  as  a  prototype  electrostrictive  material.  The  electromechanical  properties  of  some  common  electro-
strictive materials are also compared. A few common criteria used to select relaxor ferroelectrics for electro-
strictive applications are also outlined.
