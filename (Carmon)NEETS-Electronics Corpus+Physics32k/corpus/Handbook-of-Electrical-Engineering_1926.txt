Design  of  dedicated  circuits  is  not  a  simple  task.  Dedicated  circuits  provide  limited  or  no  programming
ﬂexibility. They require less silicon area and consume less power. However, the low production volume, high
design  cost,  and  long  turnaround  time  are  some  of  the  difﬁculties  associated  with  the  design  of  dedicated
systems. Another difﬁculty is the availability of appropriate computer-aided design (CAD) tools for DSP systems.
As time progresses, however, the architectural design techniques will be better understood and can be incor-
porated into CAD tools, thus making the design of dedicated circuits easier. Hierarchical CAD tools can integrate
the design at various levels in an automatic and efﬁcient manner. Implementation of standards for signal and
image processing using dedicated circuits will lead to higher volume production. As time progresses, dedicated
designs will be more acceptable to customers of DSP.
