The SUPERHETERODYNE receiver is almost always used in microwave radar systems. A typical
superheterodyne radar receiver is shown in figure 2-23. A receiver of this type meets all the requirements
listed above. Signals from the antenna enter the receiver via the duplexer. A low-noise rf amplifier is
usually the first stage of modern radar receivers. Some receivers, however, send the antenna signal
directly to the mixer, as shown by the dashed path. The low-noise amplifiers used in modern systems are
usually solid-state devices, such as tunnel-diode, parametric, or microwave transistor amplifiers.
