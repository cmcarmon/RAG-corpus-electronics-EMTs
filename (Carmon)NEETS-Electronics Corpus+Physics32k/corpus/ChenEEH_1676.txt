blobs in a query image. On similar lines but in domain-speciﬁc
context, Iqbal and Aggarwal (1999) apply perceptual grouping
to develop a CBIR system for images containing buildings. In
their work,
semantic interrelationships between different
primitive image features are exploited by perceptual grouping
to detect presence of man-made structures. Perceptual
grouping uses concepts as grouping by proximity, similarity,
continuation, closure, and symmetry to organize primitive
image features into meaningful higher level image relations.
The approach is based on the observation that the presence of
a man-made structure in an image will generate a large
number of signiﬁcant edges,
lines, and
groups in comparison with an image of predominantly non-
building objects. These structures are generated by the pres-
ence of corners, windows, doors, and boundaries of the
buildings, for example. The features they extract from an
image are hierarchical in nature and include line segments,
longer linear lines, L junctions, U junctions, parallel lines,
parallel groups, and signiﬁcant parallel groups.
