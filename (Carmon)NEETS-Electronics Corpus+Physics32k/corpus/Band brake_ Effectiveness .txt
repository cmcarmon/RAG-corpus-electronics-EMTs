One way to describe the effectiveness of the brake is as




e

μ
θ




{\displaystyle e^{\mu \theta }}
, where



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }
is the coefficient of friction between band and drum, and



θ


{\displaystyle \theta }
is the angle of wrap. With a large



μ
θ


{\displaystyle \mu \theta }
, the brake is very effective and requires low input force to achieve high brake force, but is also very sensitive to changes in



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }
. For example, light rust on the drum may cause the brake to "grab" or chatter, water may cause the brake to slip, and rising temperatures in braking may cause the coefficient of friction to drop slightly but in turn cause brake force to drop greatly. Using a band material with low



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }
increases the input force required to achieve a given brake force, but some low-



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }
materials also have more consistent



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }
across the range of working temperatures.
