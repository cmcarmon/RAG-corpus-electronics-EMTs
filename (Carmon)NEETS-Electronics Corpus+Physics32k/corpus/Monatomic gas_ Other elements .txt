Monatomic hydrogen comprises about 75% of the elemental mass of the universe.
The motion of a monatomic gas is translation (electronic excitation is not important at room temperature). Thus in an adiabatic process, monatomic gases have an idealised γ-factor (Cp/Cv) of 5/3, as opposed to 7/5 for ideal diatomic gases where rotation (but not vibration at room temperature) also contributes. Also, for ideal monatomic gases:
the molar heat capacity at constant pressure (Cp) is 5/2 R = 20.8 J K−1 mol−1 (4.97 cal K−1 mol−1);
the molar heat capacity at constant volume (Cv) is 3/2 R = 12.5 J K−1 mol−1 (2.98 cal K−1 mol−1);
where R is the gas constant.
