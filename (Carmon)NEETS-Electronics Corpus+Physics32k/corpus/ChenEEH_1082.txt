appreciate the scope and impact of integrating microelectron-
ics and micromechanics. One way to do this is to consider
Figure 6.2. It is arguably the most important graphic in the
entire ﬁeld of MEMS. We note that the microelectronic per-
sonal computer and Internet revolutions all occurred using
components without moving parts. The addition of microma-
chined parts to microelectronics opens up a large and very
important parameter space to technological development and
exploitation. The ﬁgure also shows the regions into which fall
both current and future applications of MEMS. Most com-
mercial MEMS have only a few electronic and mechanical
components. Two commercially important exceptions are
the ADXL microaccelerometers from Analog Devices and the
Digital Mirror Display (DMD) from Texas Instruments. These
are reviewed in the upcoming paragraphs. The variety of
potential applications shown in Figure 6.2 is remarkable. The
impacts of MEMS will increasingly be felt in many industries
and by many consumers.
