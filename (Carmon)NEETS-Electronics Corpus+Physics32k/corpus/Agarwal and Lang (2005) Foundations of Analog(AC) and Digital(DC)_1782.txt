this example, we will analyze the behavior of the switched power supply circuit shown
in Figure 12.41.The purpose of the circuit is to convert the DC input voltage V to a
different output voltage vOUT. The MOSFETs in the circuit operate as switches, and
the square-wave inputs to the MOSFET’s are shown in Figure 12.42. For variety, the
switched power supply circuit in this example has a slightly different arrangement of
switches than the one previously discussed in Figure 12.11. We will further assume
that the switches have some resistance associated with them. Specifically, assume that
the MOSFET’s have RON = R, the inductor has inductance L, and the capacitor has
