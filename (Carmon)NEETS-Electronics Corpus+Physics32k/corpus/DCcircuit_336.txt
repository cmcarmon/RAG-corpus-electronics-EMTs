If the victim is conscious, it is best to have them lie still until qualiﬁed emergency response
personnel arrive on the scene. There is the possibility of the victim going into a state of physio-
logical shock – a condition of insufﬁcient blood circulation different from electrical shock – and
so they should be kept as warm and comfortable as possible. An electrical shock insufﬁcient
to cause immediate interruption of the heartbeat may be strong enough to cause heart irregu-
larities or a heart attack up to several hours later, so the victim should pay close attention to
their own condition after the incident, ideally under supervision.
