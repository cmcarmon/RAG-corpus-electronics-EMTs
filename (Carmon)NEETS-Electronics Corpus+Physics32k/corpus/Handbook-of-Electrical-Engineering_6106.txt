The  good  contour  behavior  near  the  operating  region  has  allowed  a  faster  method  to  be  adopted. A  seed
load ï¬‚ow solution, corresponding to the nominal system state, is obtained to begin drawing the chart. A region
growing process is then used to locate the region in which all constrained variables are less than 10% beyond
their  limits.  This  process  is  similar  to  a  technique  used  in  computer  vision  systems  to  recognize  shapes  of
objects. The region grows by investigating the six nearest lattice vertices to any unconstrained vertex. Linear
interpolation along the edges between vertices is then used to estimate the points of intersection between the
contour and the lattice. This method has a second advantage in that it can detect holes and islands in the chart.
However, it should be noted that these regions are purely speculative and have not been found in practice.
