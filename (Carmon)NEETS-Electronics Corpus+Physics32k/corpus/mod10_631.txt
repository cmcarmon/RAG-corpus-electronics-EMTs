In the rectangular-coordinate graph, points are located by projection from a pair of stationary, 
perpendicular axes. In the polar-coordinate graph, points are located by projection along a rotating axis 
(radius) to an intersection with one of several concentric, equally-spaced circles. The horizontal axis on 
the rectangular-coordinate graph corresponds to the circles on the polar-coordinate graph. The vertical 
axis on the rectangular-coordinate graph corresponds to the rotating axis (radius) on the polar-coordinate 
graph.
