(15.18)
−5 or so, the output voltage is equal to the input
That is, within a part of 10
voltage. An obvious question: Why not just use a piece of copper wire to
get the gain of one in Equation 15.18? To answer, we need only look at the
currents. The current that must be supplied by the input source is i
, hence is
a few nanoamps. The maximum current that can be supplied to some load by
the Op Amp output circuit is a few milliamperes. Thus for a one-volt signal
−8 watts from the signal source, but can
level, the circuit is drawing perhaps 10
−3 watts to the load resistor RL. A piece of wire obviously produces

no such power gain. Said in another way, the Op Amp is providing isolation
