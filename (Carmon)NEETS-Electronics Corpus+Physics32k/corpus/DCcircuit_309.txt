Safety is one of the reasons electrical wires are usually covered with plastic or rubber in-
sulation: to vastly increase the amount of resistance between the conductor and whoever or
whatever might contact it. Unfortunately, it would be prohibitively expensive to enclose power
line conductors in sufÔ¨Åcient insulation to provide safety in case of accidental contact, so safety
is maintained by keeping those lines far enough out of reach so that no one can accidently
touch them.
