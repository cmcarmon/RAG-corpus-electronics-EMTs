The North Central plane had two passengers and a crew of three – the captain, the first officer, and a flight attendant – on board, while the Air Wisconsin flight was carrying a crew of two (the captain and first officer) and six passengers. All 13 people aboard the two planes died in the collision and subsequent crash, and the NTSB observed that the accident was not survivable.
