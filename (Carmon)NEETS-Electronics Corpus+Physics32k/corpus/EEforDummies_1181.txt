You can most easily test switches by taking them out of a circuit. If the switch 
is still wired into a circuit, the meter may not show infinite ohms when you 
place the switch in the off position. If, instead, you get a reading of some 
value other than 0 Ω, you can assume the switch is operating properly as an 
open circuit when it’s in the off position.
