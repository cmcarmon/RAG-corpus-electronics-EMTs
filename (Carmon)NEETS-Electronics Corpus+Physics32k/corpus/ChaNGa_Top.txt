ChaNGa (Charm N-body GrAvity solver) is a computer program to perform collisionless N-body simulations. It can perform cosmological simulations with periodic boundary conditions in comoving coordinates or simulations of isolated stellar systems. It is based on the Barnesâ€“Hut algorithm and uses Ewald summation for periodic forces.
ChaNGa makes use of the Charm++ parallel programming system, including its dynamic load balancing schemes, in order to scale to large processor configurations. Simulation results have been reported on up to 20,000 IBM Bluegene/L processors [1].
