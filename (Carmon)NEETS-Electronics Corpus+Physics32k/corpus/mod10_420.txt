Flexible coaxial lines (figure 3-7) are made with an inner conductor that consists of flexible wire
insulated from the outer conductor by a solid, continuous insulating material. The outer conductor is made
of metal braid, which gives the line flexibility. Early attempts at gaining flexibility involved using rubber
insulators between the two conductors. However, the rubber insulators caused excessive losses at high
frequencies.
