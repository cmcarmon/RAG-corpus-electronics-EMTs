micromachining of many other metals and alloys has been
demonstrated. The so-called ‘‘shape memory’’ alloys are used
for actuators in several types of MEMS (e.g., microﬂuidic
pumps and valves). Magnetic materials have been incorporated
into some MEMS devices. Piezoelectric materials are especially
attractive for MEMS because of their electrical–mechanical
reciprocity. That is, application of a voltage to a piezoelectric
material deforms it, and application of a strain produces a
voltage. Zinc oxide and lead zirconium titinate (PZT) are
important piezoelectric materials for MEMS. Many other
examples of materials employed for MEMS could be given.
However, the point is clear: micromechanics are made of many
more kinds of materials than microelectronics.
