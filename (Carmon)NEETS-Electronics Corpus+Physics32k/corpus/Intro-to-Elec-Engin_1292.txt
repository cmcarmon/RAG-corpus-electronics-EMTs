The remainder of this chapter deals with basic methods for analyzing and processing analog
signals. A large number of building blocks in a communication system can be modeled by linear
time-invariant (LTI) systems. LTI systems provide good and accurate models for a large class of
communication channels. Some basic components of transmitters and receivers (such as ﬁlters,
ampliﬁers, and equalizers) are LTI systems.
