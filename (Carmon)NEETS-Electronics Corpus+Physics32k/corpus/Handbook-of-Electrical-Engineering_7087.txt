Speech
Telephone quality speech is normally sampled at 8 kHz and quantized at 8 bits/sample (a rate of 64 kbits/s)
for  uncompressed  speech.  Simple  compression  algorithms  like  adaptive  differential  pulse  code  modulation
(ADPCM) [Jayant and Noll, 1984] use the correlation between adjacent samples to reduce the number of bits
used by a factor of two to four or more with almost imperceptible distortion. Much higher compression ratios
can be obtained with algorithms like linear predictive coding (LPC), which model speech as an autoregressive
process,  and  send  the  parameters  of  the  process  as  opposed  to  sending  the  speech  itself.  With  LPC-based
methods,  it  is  possible  to  code  speech  at  less  than  4  kbits/s.  At  very  low  bit  rates,  however,  the  reproduced
speech sounds synthetic.
