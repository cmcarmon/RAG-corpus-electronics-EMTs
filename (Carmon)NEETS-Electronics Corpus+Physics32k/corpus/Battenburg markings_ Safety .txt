One purpose for conspicuity is to reduce accidents due to an emergency vehicle not being noticed in a situation not usual to traffic conditions, e.g., stopped in fast-moving traffic, or moving at a different speed or in a different direction. The Battenburg side markings, together often with chevron front and rear markings, are intended to reduce accidents due to "looked but failed to see". Several criticisms of the Battenburg scheme were raised at the October 2010 3rd Annual US Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Safety Summit in the context of use on ambulances, including the difficulty of applying it to small, curved, or odd-shaped surfaces, high costs, the confusing pattern caused when several parked Battenburg vehicles visually overlap, breaking up the vehicle shape against complex backgrounds or with open doors and hatches, and other combinations than police yellow/blue being less effective and even progressing to camouflage with some body colours. In particular transferring the pattern from UK police to other services and countries was criticised, making the public struggle to decipher unfamiliar markings. The high-visibility chevrons often used on the rear and front of Battenburg-marked vehicles "through popular opinion rather than by a scientific process of testing and research" were found not be effective at reducing rear-end collisions; the presence of a stationary vehicle on a high-speed road may be noticed, but not that it is stopped. Parking at an angle in such situations was a far more effective way of drawing attention to the motionlessness of a vehicle.
