Thermal Page Printing
Thermal transfer page printing is accomplished by using a stationary page-wide linear array of thermal heating
elements coupled with a page-wide transfer ribbon roll (see Serial Thermal Printing below for discussion of
thermal printhead technologies). The ribbon is positioned between the printhead and the receiving paper. The
ribbon  typically  consists  of  a  polycarbonate  or  polyester  ﬁlm  substrate  (10–20 mm)  coated  with  a  waxy  ink
layer. Heat from the thermal printhead elements must penetrate through the substrate to heat (melt) the dye/wax
coating. The melted ink layer is pressed into the paper surface by printhead pressure, and after the paper and
ribbon move together away from the printhead, the partially cooled ink layer adheres better to the paper than
