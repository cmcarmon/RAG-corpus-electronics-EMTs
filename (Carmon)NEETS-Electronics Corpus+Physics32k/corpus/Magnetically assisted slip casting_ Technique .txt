The technique involves pouring a suspension of magnetized ceramic micro-plates. Pores in the plaster mold absorb the liquid from the suspension, solidifying the material from the outside in. The particles are subjected to a strong magnetic field as they solidify that causes them to align in one direction. The fieldâ€™s orientation is changed at regular intervals, moving the plates still in suspension, without disturbing already-solidified plates. By varying the composition of the suspension and the direction of the platelets, a continuous process can produce multiple layers with differing material properties in a single object. The resulting objects can closely imitate their natural models.
