The Fourier transform relates a signal’s time and frequency domain representations to each other. The
direct Fourier transform (or simply the Fourier transform) calculates a signal’s frequency domain repre-
sentation from its time-domain variant (4.34). The inverse Fourier transform (4.35) ﬁnds the time-domain
representation from the frequency domain. Rather than explicitly writing the required integral, we often
symbolically express these transform calculations as F (s) and F−1 (S), respectively.
