At radio frequencies below the UHF range, power is usually determined by voltage, current, and
impedance measurements. One common method used to determine the output power of radio-frequency
(rf) oscillators and radio transmitters consists of connecting a known resistance to the equipment output
terminals. Current flowing through this resistance is then measured and the power is calculated as the
product of I2R.
