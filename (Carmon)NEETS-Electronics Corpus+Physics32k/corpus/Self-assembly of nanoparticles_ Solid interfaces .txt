Nano-particles can self-assemble on solid surfaces after applying external forces (like magnetic, electric, and flow) as mentioned in the above section. Templates made of microstructures like carbon nanotubes or block polymers can also be used to assist in self-assembly; they cause directed self-assembly (DSA) in which active sites are embedded to selectively induce nanoparticle deposition. Such templates are considered as any object onto which different particles can be arranged into a structure with a morphology similar to that of the template. Carbon nanotubes (microstructures), single molecules, or block copolymers are common templates. Nanoparticles are often shown to self-assemble within distances of nanometers and micrometers, but block copolymer templates can be used to form well-defined self-assemblies over macroscopic distances. By incorporating active sites to the surfaces of nanotubes and polymers, the functionalization of these templates can be transformed to favor self-assembly of specified nanoparticles.
