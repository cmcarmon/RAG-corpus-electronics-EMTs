Notice  that  the  branch  currents  are  different  from  the  mesh  cur-
rents unless the mesh is isolated. To distinguish between the two types
of currents, we use i for a mesh current and I for a branch current. The
current elements 
are algebraic sums of the mesh currents.
It is evident from Fig. 3.17 that
