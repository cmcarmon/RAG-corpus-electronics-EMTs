drops to 532 RPM after the torque disturbance is loaded,
which has a deviation of 79 RPM from the desired idle speed
of 611 RPM. The engine speed increases to 681 RPM after
the torque load is removed, with a difference of 70 RPM. The
disturbance is rejected (5% rise time) after about 22 engine
cycles for the loading case and 25 engine cycles for the
unloading case. The minimum engine speed is 601 RPM,
with a difference of 139 RPM from the nominal idle speed of
740 RPM. Once again, this response may be compared with
that of the production controller, which uses both mass airï¬‚ow
and spark advance as control inputs, shown in Figure 10.6.
When comparing Figure 10.9 to Figure 10.6, it is important to
note that the production controller regulates to a nominal
engine speed of 740 RPM (as opposed to 611 for the controller
of Figure 10.9). We therefore conclude that the adaptive DSMC
as developed, which uses only the idle valve opening as control
input, exhibits superior performance over the production con-
troller that uses two control inputs.
