tion e = N(dΦ/dt). This self-induced voltage across the coil, as a result of a gradual change in
current magnitude through the coil, happens to be of a polarity that attempts to oppose the
change in current. In other words, the induced voltage polarity resulting from an increase in
current will be oriented in such a way as to push against the direction of current, to try to keep
the current at its former magnitude. This phenomenon exhibits a more general principle of
physics known as Lenz’s Law, which states that an induced effect will always be opposed to the
cause producing it.
