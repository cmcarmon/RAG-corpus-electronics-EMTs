	
Among	the	plethora	of	prospects	for	a	circuit	engineer	is	the	opportunity	to	engage	in
circuit-bending	or	the	art	(and	science)	of	modifying	existing	circuits	of	electronic
devices,	and	turning	them	into	new	musical	instruments.	In	many	cases,	he	isn’t	required
to	follow	a	set	of	rules	for	tweaking	a	circuit	to	incorporate	a	particular	sound;	in	fact,	he
can	re-design	an	electronic	device	as	desired.
Alongside,	an	advantage	of	circuit-bending	is	its	reward	of	reducing	necessary	expenses.
In	the	event	that	he	is	very	resourceful,	the	circuit	creator	can	maximize	the	advantage
even	more;	he	can	install	used	(but	in	working	condition)	components	or	less	costly	parts.
Circuit-bending	is	merely	one	of	the	exciting	possibilities	for	a	fellow	in	circuitry.	The
options	are	rather	limitless,	especially	if	you	let	your	creativity	run	loose.	So	long	as	you
are	certain	that	a	circuit	will	work	given	a	particular	arrangement,	you	shouldn’t	hold	back
in	taking	your	beginner’s	knowledge	of	circuits	to	an	advanced	level.
