and we succinctly express n in base-b as nb = dN dN−1 . . . d0. The number 25 in base-10 equals 2×101+5×100,
so that the digits representing this number are d0 = 5, d1 = 2, and all other dk equal zero. This same
number in binary (base-2) equals 11001 (1 × 24 + 1 × 23 + 0 × 22 + 0 × 21 + 1 × 20) and 19 in hexadecimal
