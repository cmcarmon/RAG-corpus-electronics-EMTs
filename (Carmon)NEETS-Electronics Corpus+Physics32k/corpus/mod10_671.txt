The directional characteristics of a folded dipole are the same as those of a simple dipole. However, 
the reactance of a folded dipole varies much more slowly as the frequency is varied from resonance. 
Because of this the folded dipole can be used over a much wider frequency range than is possible with a 
simple dipole.
