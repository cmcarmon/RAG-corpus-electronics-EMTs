The important thing to remember is that a small current from gate to cathode can fire or trigger the 
SCR, changing it from practically an open circuit to a short circuit. The only way to change it back again 
(to commutate it) is to reduce the load current to a value less than the minimum forward-bias current. 
Gate current is required only until the anode current has completely built up to a point sufficient to sustain
