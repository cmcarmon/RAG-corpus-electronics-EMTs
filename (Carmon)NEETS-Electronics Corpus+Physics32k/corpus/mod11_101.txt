The construction and essential components of a TWO-CAVITY KLYSTRON are shown in figure 
2-7A. Figure 2-7B is a schematic representation of the same tube. When the tube is energized, the cathode 
emits electrons which are focused into a beam by a low positive voltage on the control grid. The beam is 
then accelerated by a very high positive dc potential that is applied in equal amplitude to both the 
accelerator grid and the buncher grids. The buncher grids are connected to a cavity resonator that 
superimposes an ac potential on the dc voltage. Ac potentials are produced by oscillations within the 
cavity that begin spontaneously when the tube is energized. The initial oscillations are caused by random 
fields and circuit imbalances that are present when the circuit is energized. The oscillations within the 
cavity produce an oscillating electrostatic field between the buncher grids that is at the same frequency as 
the natural frequency of the cavity. The direction of the field changes with the frequency of the cavity. 
These changes alternately accelerate and decelerate the electrons of the beam passing through the grids. 
The area beyond the buncher grids is called the DRIFT SPACE. The electrons form bunches in this area 
when the accelerated electrons overtake the decelerated electrons.
