p r o b l e m 10.12 You can see from Problem 10.10 that for circuit time constant
τ (cid:5) t1 and t2 the capacitor voltage starts from some value Vmin and increases when
vS is positive; then when vS is zero, vO starts at some value Vmax and decreases. By
definition, the ‘‘steady state’’ of the circuit is when vO charges from Vmin to Vmax, then
discharges from Vmax to the same Vmin. Assuming t1 = t2, sketch the vO waveform in
the steady state.
