or three times the bandwidth of the outdated long coaxial cable trunks. With fewer active components, reliability
is improved. The cost of the lightwave components can be small compared to the overall system cost. These
compelling  technical  and  economic  advantages  resulted  in  the  immediate  demand  for  lightwave  AM-VSB
systems.
