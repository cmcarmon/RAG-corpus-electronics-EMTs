An injury of great concern is that to the lens of the eye. Exposure of the lens to high-intensity 
microwaves may cause cataracts. Current medical evidence indicates that a significant temperature 
elevation of the lens is required for cataract formation. If exposure is limited to 10 milliwatts per 
centimeter squared, the lens temperature is not elevated to levels at which cataracts occur.
