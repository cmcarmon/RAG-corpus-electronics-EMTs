Light-emitting devices produce light when subject to 
a current flow, converting electrical energy to light 
energy. A light-emitting	diode	(leD) is the most 
common semiconductor light-emitting device. Being 
a semiconductor component, it has an unlimited life 
span due to the absence of a filament, a cause of trou-
ble in conventional lamps.
