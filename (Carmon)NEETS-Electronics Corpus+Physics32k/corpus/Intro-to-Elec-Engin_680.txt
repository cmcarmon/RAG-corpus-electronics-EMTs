Figure 7.4.9 shows a p-channel enhancement MOSFET which differs from an n-channel
device in that the doping types are interchanged. Channel conduction now requires negative gate-
to-source voltage or positive source-to-gate voltage. With vSG > VT and vSD > 0, iD ï¬‚ows
from source to drain, as shown in Figure 7.4.9(a). The p-channel and n-channel MOSFETs are
complementary transistors, having the same general characteristics but opposite current direction
and voltage polarities. By replacing vGS and vDS with vSG and vSD, respectively, the equations of
the n-channel MOSFET apply to the p-channel MOSFET. However, a p-type channel does not
conduct as well as an n-type channel of the same size because holes are less mobile than electrons.
Consequently, smaller values of IDSS are typical of the p-channel MOSFETs.
