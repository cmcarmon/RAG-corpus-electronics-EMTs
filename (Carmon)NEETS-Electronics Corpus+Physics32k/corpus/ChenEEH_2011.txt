Luk and Park (1988) analyzed the effect of roundoff errors
on various matrix decomposition methods. They also con-
cluded that small roundoff errors are magniﬁed in the ﬁnal
result, thus necessitating the use of a large threshold for the FP
checksum test to prevent false alarms. As Boley and Luk (1991)
determined, a good threshold depends on the condition
number of the matrix of checksum coefﬁcients. Thus, the
selection of the threshold is generally a difﬁcult issue. False
alarms can occur when the threshold is too small, and rela-
tively large roundoff errors can be mistaken as the presence of
an error in the result, which can lead to unnecessary recom-
putation. On the other hand, a large threshold can cause an
