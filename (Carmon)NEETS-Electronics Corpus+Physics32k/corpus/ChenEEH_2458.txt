shape and size as that of the slot. The complementary strip
dipole is to be excited by a voltage gap, breaking across the
strip at the same position where the slot antenna is excited. If
the slot antenna is superimposed on its complementary dipole
antenna structure, one would obtain an inﬁnite conducting
plane. Interestingly, employing certain symmetry in Maxwell’s
equations and realizing the complementary nature of the
above two structures, it can be shown that the ﬁelds of a slot
antenna and that of a complementary dipole antenna are
related to each other in a simple manner. This theory is called
Babinet’s principle (Balanis, 1997), which consequently re-
lates the various transmit/receive characteristics, such as the
pattern, gain, and input impedance of the two complementary
antennas.
