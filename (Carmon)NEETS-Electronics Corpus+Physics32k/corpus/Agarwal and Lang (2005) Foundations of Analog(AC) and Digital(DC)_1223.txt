p r o b l e m 8.14 Consider again the compound three-terminal device formed by
connecting two BJTs in the configuration shown in Figure 7.90 (Problem 7.19). This
problem relates to the small-signal analysis of this device. Assume that the two BJTs are
identical, each with Î² = 100, and that each of the BJTs operates in the active region.
