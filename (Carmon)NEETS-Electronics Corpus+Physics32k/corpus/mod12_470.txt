Look again at the circuit in figure 3-16. With no signal applied to the limiter grid (3), the tube
conducts. The electron beam moving near the quadrature grid (5) induces a current into the grid which
develops a voltage across the high-Q tank circuit (L3 and C3). C3 charges until it becomes sufficiently
