Figure 3-6 shows the equilibrium energy level diagram of a tunnel diode with no bias applied. Note 
in view A that the valence band of the P-material overlaps the conduction band of the N-material. The 
majority electrons and holes are at the same energy level in the equilibrium state. If there is any 
movement of current carriers across the depletion region due to thermal energy, the net current flow will 
be zero because equal numbers of current carriers flow in opposite directions. The zero net current flow is 
marked by a "0" on the current-voltage curve illustrated in view B.
