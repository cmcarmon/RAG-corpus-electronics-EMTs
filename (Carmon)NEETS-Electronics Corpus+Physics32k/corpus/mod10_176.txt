Although electromagnetic fields that are radiated are commonly considered to be waves, under
certain circumstances their behavior makes them appear to have some of the properties of particles. In
general, however, it is easier to picture electromagnetic radiation in space as horizontal and vertical lines
of force oriented at right angles to each other. These lines of force are made up of an electric field (E) and
a magnetic field (H), which together make up the electromagnetic field in space.
