Instead of implementing common operators such as multi-
plication using ﬁne-grain FPGA resources, it can be more
effective to have customized conﬁgurable blocks designed
speciﬁcally for such operators. For instance, Haynes et al.
(1999) have proposed conﬁgurable blocks for efﬁcient multi-
plication. An array of these blocks are capable of being conﬁg-
ured to perform any 8-m by 8-nb signed and unsigned
multiplication. The architecture is based on the radix-4 over-
lapped multiple-bit scanning algorithm. When compared with
existing FPGAs for implementing multipliers, this design is
shown to be both faster and require fewer transistors.
