where J(q(t)) is the Jacobian matrix. Using the above equation, the combination of the joint rates for a given
hand motion can be obtained. However, special consideration must be given when the inverse of the Jacobian
matrix does not exist. This occurs when the dimension of x(t) and q(t) are not the same (robots with redundant
