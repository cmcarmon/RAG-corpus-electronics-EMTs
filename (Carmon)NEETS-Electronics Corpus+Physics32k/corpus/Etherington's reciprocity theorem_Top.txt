The Etherington's distance-duality equation is the relationship between the luminosity distance of standard candles and the angular diameter distance. The equation is as follows:




d

L


=
(
1
+
z

)

2



d

A




{\displaystyle d_{L}=(1+z)^{2}d_{A}}
, where




d

L




{\displaystyle d_{L}}
is the luminosity distance and




d

A




{\displaystyle d_{A}}
the angular-diameter distance.
