use of formulas derived from Ohm’s law. As in many other fields of science, electricity has its share of
special shortcut methods. Some of the special circuit analysis techniques are: THEVENIN’S THEOREM,
which uses a process of circuit reduction to Thevenin’s equivalent circuit; and NORTON’S THEOREM,
which is reduction of a circuit to Norton’s equivalent. Another method is called LOOP ANALYSIS. This
uses Kirchhoff’s voltage law to simultaneously solve problems in parallel branches of a circuit. The use of
