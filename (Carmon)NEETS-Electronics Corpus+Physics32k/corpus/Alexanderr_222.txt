4.10.2 Resistance Measurement
Although the ohmmeter method provides the simplest way to measure
resistance,  more  accurate  measurement  may  be  obtained  using  the
Wheatstone  bridge.  While  ohmmeters  are  designed  to  measure  resist-
ance in low, mid, or high range, a Wheatstone bridge is used to mea-
sure resistance in the mid range, say, between 
Very low
values  of  resistances  are  measured  with  a  milliohmmeter,  while  very
high values are measured with a Megger tester.
