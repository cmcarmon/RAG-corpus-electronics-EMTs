In general relativity, the curvature of spacetime is expressed by the Einstein tensor in the Einstein field equations.
These tensor equations determine how spacetime (represented by a manifold) is warped by the presence of mass-energy (expressed in the stress energy tensor), producing the apparent phenomenon of gravitation as a fictitious force. The curvature is highly significant in cosmology, as the shape of the universe affects its ultimate fate.
Other hypotheses such as Kaluza-Klein theory and string theory involve a curved spacetime, extended into higher dimensions, in attempts to unify forces as a single phenomenon.
