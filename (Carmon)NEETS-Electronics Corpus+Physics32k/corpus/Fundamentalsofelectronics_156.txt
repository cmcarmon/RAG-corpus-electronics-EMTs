We want to ﬁnd the total resistance of the example circuit. To apply the series and parallel
combination rules, it is best to ﬁrst determine the circuit’s structure: What is in series with what
and what is in parallel with what at both small- and large-scale views. We have R2 in parallel
with R3; this combination is in series with R4. This series combination is in parallel with R1. Note
that in determining this structure, we started away from the terminals, and worked toward them.
In most cases, this approach works well; try it ﬁrst. The total resistance expression mimics the
structure:
