The polarity of all voltages in Millmanâ€™s Theorem are referenced to the same point. In the
example circuit above, I used the bottom wire of the parallel circuit as my reference point,
and so the voltages within each branch (28 for the R1 branch, 0 for the R2 branch, and 7
for the R3 branch) were inserted into the equation as positive numbers. Likewise, when the
answer came out to 8 volts (positive), this meant that the top wire of the circuit was positive
with respect to the bottom wire (the original point of reference). If both batteries had been
connected backwards (negative ends up and positive ends down), the voltage for branch 1
would have been entered into the equation as a -28 volts, the voltage for branch 3 as -7 volts,
and the resulting answer of -8 volts would have told us that the top wire was negative with
respect to the bottom wire (our initial point of reference).
