Then, the spectrum becomes like the one shown in Figure 4.8.
One particular nonrectangular grid of interest arises when
we make Ty Â¼
Tx. We refer to it as hexagonal sampling.
One advantage of using such a sampling grid instead of the
rectangular one is that, for signals with isotropic frequency
response, hexagonal sampling needs 13.4% fewer samples than
the rectangular one for representing them without aliasing
(Mersereaw and Dudgeon, 1984). Such sampling grid is also
useful when the continuous signals have a baseband as in
Figure 4.2, as can be observed from Figures 4.4, 4.5, and 4.8.
In fact, given the support region of a baseband signal, one can
always determine the best sampling grid so that aliasing is
avoided with the smallest possible density of samples.
