Very large-scale integrated circuit (VLSI) arithmetic units are
essential for the operations of the data paths and/or the ad-
dressing units of microprocessors, digital signal processors
(DSPs), as well as data-processing application-speciﬁc inte-
grated circuits (ASICs) and programmable integrated circuits.
Their optimized realization, in terms of power or energy con-
sumption, area, and/or speed,
for meeting
demanding operational speciﬁcations of such devices.
