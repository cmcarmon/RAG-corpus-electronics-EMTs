To gain some intuition, think of a closed-loop negative feedback system. Apply a small sinusoid at frequency
w to the input. Assume that the gain around the loop, KGH, is 1 or more, and that the phase lag is 180 degrees.
The summing junction will ï¬‚ip over the fed back signal and add it to the original signal. The result is a signal
that is bigger than what came in. This signal will circulate around this loop, getting bigger and bigger until the
real system no longer matches the model. This is what we call instability.
