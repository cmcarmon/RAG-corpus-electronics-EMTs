ACORN TUBES, as shown in figure 2-10, are available for use as diodes, triodes, or pentodes.
Acorns are very small tubes that have closely spaced electrodes and no bases. The tubes are connected to
their circuits by short wire pins that are sealed in the glass or ceramic envelope. Because of their small
size, acorn tubes are usually used in low-power uhf circuits.
