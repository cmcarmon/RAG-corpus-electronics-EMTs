Feeder voltage regulators are used extensively to regulate the
voltage of each feeder separately to maintain a reasonable
constant voltage at the point of utilization. They are either
the induction-type or the step-type regulators. However,
todayâ€™s modern step-type voltage regulators have practically
replaced induction-type regulators.
