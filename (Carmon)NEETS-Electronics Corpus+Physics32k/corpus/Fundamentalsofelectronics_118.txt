Sources of voltage and current are also circuit elements, but they are not linear in the strict sense of linear
systems. For example, the voltage source’s v-i relation is v = vs regardless of what the current might be.
As for the current source, i = −is regardless of the voltage. Another name for a constant-valued voltage
source is a battery, and can be purchased in any supermarket. Current sources, on the other hand, are much
harder to acquire; we’ll learn why later.
3.3 Ideal and Real-World Circuit Elements9
Source and linear circuit elements are ideal circuit elements. One central notion of circuit theory is combining
the ideal elements to describe how physical elements operate in the real world. For example, the 1 kΩ
