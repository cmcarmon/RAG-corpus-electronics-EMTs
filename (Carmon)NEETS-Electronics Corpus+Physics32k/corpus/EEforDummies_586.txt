If the resistance of the potentiometer is 0 Ω, the voltage across the LED is 0 V. 
As you increase R2 (that is, the resistance of the pot), the voltage across the 
LED increases. When R2 reaches a certain point, the voltage across the LED 
rises enough to turn on the LED. VLED climbs to about 2.0 V when R2 rises to 
about 134 Ω. (Plug in 134 for R2 in the preceding equation and see for yourself!)
