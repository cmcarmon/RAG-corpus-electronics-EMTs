First, a data-ï¬‚ow transformation is applied to remove the
computation of the maximum of the whole image in the
function Reverse(). Although this computation is negligible
in terms of CPU time, it is very important in terms of data
transfer and storage because the whole image has to read from
memory and be stored again before the next function Detect-
Roots() can proceed.
