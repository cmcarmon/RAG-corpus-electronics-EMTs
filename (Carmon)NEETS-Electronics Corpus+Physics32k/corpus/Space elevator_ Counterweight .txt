Several solutions have been proposed to act as a counterweight:
a heavy, captured asteroid;
a space dock, space station or spaceport positioned past geostationary orbit
a further upward extension of the cable itself so that the net upward pull would be the same as an equivalent counterweight;
parked spent climbers that had been used to thicken the cable during construction, other junk, and material lifted up the cable for the purpose of increasing the counterweight.
Extending the cable has the advantage of some simplicity of the task and the fact that a payload that went to the end of the counterweight-cable would acquire considerable velocity relative to the Earth, allowing it to be launched into interplanetary space. Its disadvantage is the need to produce greater amounts of cable material as opposed to using just anything available that has mass.
