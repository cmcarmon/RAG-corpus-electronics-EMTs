To multiply, we must take the two signiﬁcant sets of digits (6.25 and 3.6) and multiply
them together; and we need to take the two powers-of-ten and multiply them together. Taking
6.25 times 3.6, we get 22.5. Taking 1018 times 103, we get 1021 (exponents with common base
numbers add). So, the answer is:
