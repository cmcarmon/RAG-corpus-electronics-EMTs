Computational steering systems are a manner of feedback control system, where some or all of the feedback is provided interactively by the operator.
All computational steering mechanisms have three fundamental components:
A target system that is being studied
A representation of the target system, typically a graphical visualization, that can be perceived by the investigator
A set of controls that the investigator can use to provide feedback that modifies the state, behavior, or product of the system being studied
