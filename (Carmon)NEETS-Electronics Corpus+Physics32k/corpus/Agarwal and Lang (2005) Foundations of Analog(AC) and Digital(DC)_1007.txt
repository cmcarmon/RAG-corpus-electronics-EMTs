Let us assume that the input signal has symmetric peak-to-peak swings
about the DC offset. In other words, we will assume an equal magnitude for
both the positive and negative excursions of the time-varying signal from the
DC offset, as is the case for the input signal vIN in Figure 7.35 (but not for the
output signal vO). To obtain maximum useful input signal range, we might
choose the input bias voltage VIN to be at the center of the valid range of input
voltages for the amplifier, as illustrated in Figure 7.42.
