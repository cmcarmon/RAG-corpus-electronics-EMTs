Mass concentration depends on the variation of the volume of the solution due mainly to thermal expansion. On small intervals of temperature the dependence is :

{\displaystyle \rho _{i}={\frac {\rho _{i,T_{0}}}{(1+\alpha \Delta T)}}}

where ρi,T0 is the mass concentration at a reference temperature, α is the thermal expansion coefficient of the mixture.
