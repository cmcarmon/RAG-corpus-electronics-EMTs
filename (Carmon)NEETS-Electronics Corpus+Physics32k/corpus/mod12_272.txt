MODULATION INDEX.â€”This ratio of frequency deviation to frequency of the modulating signal
is useful because it also describes the ratio of amplitude to tone for the audio signal. These factors
determine the number and spacing of the side frequencies of the transmitted signal. The modulation index
formula is shown below:
