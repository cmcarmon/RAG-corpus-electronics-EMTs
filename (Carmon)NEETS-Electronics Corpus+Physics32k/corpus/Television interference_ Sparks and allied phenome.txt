Horizontal lines randomly arranged on a television screen may be caused by sparking in a malfunctioning electrical device. Electric railways can also be a strong source of this type of interference.
Other possible sources of such interference include:
Thermostats, fridges, freezers, fish tank heaters, central heating systems
These can create sparks as they turn on or off; as they age they can become worse. In some rare cases they can create non-stop interference through sparking.

Electric motors
Motors which have a commutator can suffer from sparking at the brushes.

Ignition systems on cars and motorbikes.
