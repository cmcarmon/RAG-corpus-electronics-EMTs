Poynter was a developer of the crew and life-support systems for the Inspiration Mars free-return mission to Mars planned for launch in January 2018. The two person spaceflight mission was originally to be a private, nonprofit venture of 501 days duration which will allow a small human-carrying spacecraft to use the smallest possible amount of fuel to get it to Mars and back to Earth. However, this plan proved unworkable without significant funding and assistance from NASA.
The life support system is critical. "If anything goes wrong, the spacecraft should make its own way back to Earth â€” but with no possibility of any short-cuts home."
