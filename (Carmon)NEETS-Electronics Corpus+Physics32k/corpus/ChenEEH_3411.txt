In the case of Figure 9.6, since the relay measures the
impedance (which is proportional to distance), both current
and voltage instrument transformers are used. The relay is
used to protect the transmission line, and it is connected to a
circuit breaker at one end of the line. The other end of the line
has another relay protecting the same line by operating the
breaker at that end. In a case of a fault, both relays need to
operate, causing the corresponding breakers to open and
resulting in the transmission line being removed from service.
The role of instrument transformers is to provide galvanic
isolation and transformation of the signal energy levels between
the relay connected to the secondary side and the voltages
and currents connected to the primary side. The original cur-
rent and voltage signal levels experienced at the terminals of
