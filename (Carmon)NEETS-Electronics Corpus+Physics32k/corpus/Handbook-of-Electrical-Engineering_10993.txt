and  repolarization  processes  send  small  currents  through  the  conducting  environmental  tissues  and  ﬂuids,
resulting in a time-varying potential ﬁeld. Appropriately placed electrodes allow recording the electrical activity
of the bioelectric generators. However, the waveforms of such recordings are vastly different from those of the
transmembrane action potentials shown in Fig. 113.10. By using cable theory, it is possible to show that such
extracellular recordings resemble the second derivative of the excursion in transmembrane potential [Geddes
and  Baker,  1989].  Despite  the  difference  in  waveform,  extracellular  recordings  identify  the  excitation  and
recovery processes very well.
