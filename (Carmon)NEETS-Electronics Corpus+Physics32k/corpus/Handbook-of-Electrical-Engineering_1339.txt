MOS
The 
 is an often-used performance measure [Jayant and Noll, 1984]. To establish
a MOS for a coder, listeners are asked to classify the quality of the encoded speech in one of Ô¨Åve categories:
excellent  (5),  good  (4),  fair  (3),  poor  (2),  or  bad  (1). Alternatively,  the  listeners  may  be  asked  to  classify  the
coded speech according to the amount of perceptible distortion present, i.e., imperceptible (5), barely percep-
tible but not annoying (4), perceptible and annoying (3), annoying but not objectionable (2), or very annoying
and  objectionable  (1).  The  numbers  in  parentheses  are  used  to  assign  a  numerical  value  to  the  subjective
evaluations, and the numerical ratings of all listeners are averaged to produce a MOS for the coder. A MOS
between 4.0 and 4.5 usually indicates high quality.
