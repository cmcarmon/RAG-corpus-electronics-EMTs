The foregoing circuits provide a variety of useful ﬁrst- and second-order ﬁlters. For higher-order ﬁlters, these
sections are simply cascaded to realize the overall transfer function desired. Additional detail about these circuits
as well as other circuits used for active ﬁlters may be found in the references.
