One way to make a semiconductor diode is to metallurgically create a
wafer of silicon containing n-type material adjoining p-type material. In an
n-channel MOSFET, for example, the n-type drain juxtaposed to the p-type
channel region forms a diode. The circuit symbol for the diode, shown in
Figure 16.2, emphasizes this asymmetric structure by denoting the p region
with an arrow, and the n region as a line. If a battery and a resistor are connected
to the diode to make the p region positive with respect to the n region, as in
Figure 16.3a, large currents will flow. This is called forward bias. But if the
battery is connected in the opposite way (Figure 16.3b), to make the n region
more positive than the p region to reverse bias the diode, almost no current
will flow. This gross asymmetry in electrical behavior is the essence of the
semiconductor diode.
