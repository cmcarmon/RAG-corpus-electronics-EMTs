The equivalent circuit of the peak detector for the case of a forward biased diode 
is  shown  in  Figure  10.5.  The  diode  is  assumed  to  have  zero  resistance  in  the  forward 
direction  and  has  a  constant  voltage  drop  of  VD.  In  the  feedback  block  diagram,  the 
voltage drop can be represented as an additive signal to the output of the op amp. The 
output voltage of this equivalent circuit is
