Electric current doesn’t flow just anywhere. (If it did, you’d be getting shocked 
all the time.) Electrons flow only if you provide a closed conductive path, 
known as an electrical circuit, or simply a circuit, for them to move through, 
and initiate the flow with a battery or other source of electrical energy.
