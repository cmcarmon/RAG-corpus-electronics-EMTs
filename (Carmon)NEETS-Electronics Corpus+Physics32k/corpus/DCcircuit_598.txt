With electric circuits and circuit diagrams, the length and routing of wire connecting com-
ponents in a circuit matters little. (Actually, in some AC circuits it becomes critical, and very
long wire lengths can contribute unwanted resistance to both AC and DC circuits, but in most
cases wire length is irrelevant.) What this means for us is that we can lengthen, shrink, and/or
bend connecting wires without affecting the operation of our circuit.
