Multichannel broadcast and ship/shore terminations use tty fdm. With this system, each channel of 
the composite tone package of the broadcast is assigned an audio frequency. By multiplexing tty circuits, 
up to 16 circuits may be carried in any one of the 3,000 hertz multiplexed channels described above. 
Don't confuse the two types of multiplexing. In the first case, 3,000 hertz audio channels have been 
combined. In the second case, a number of dc tty circuits are converted to tone keying and combined in a 
single 3,000-hertz audio channel. Figure 3-31 illustrates a 16-channel, tty-multiplexing system. The 
output of the dc pulsed circuits is converted to audio keying. Each channel has a separate audio center 
frequency. Channel frequencies range from 425 hertz for the lowest channel to 2,975 hertz for the highest
