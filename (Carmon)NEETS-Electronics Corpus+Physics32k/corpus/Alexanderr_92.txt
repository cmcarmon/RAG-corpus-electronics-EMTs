3. Alternative. There are different approaches that can be used to
solve this problem. Since the focus of Sec. 2.7 is the wye-delta
transformation, this should be the technique to use. Another
approach would be to solve for the equivalent resistance by
injecting one amp into the circuit and Ô¨Ånding the voltage
between a and b; we will learn about this approach in Chap. 4.
