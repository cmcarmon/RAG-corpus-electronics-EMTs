5. It can provide operating constraints or security constraints on each agentâ€™s reactive reserve basin reserves
that  prevent  voltage  instability  in  an  agent  in  a  manner  identical  to  how  thermal  constraints  prevent
thermal  overload  on  a  branch  and  voltage  constraints  prevent  bus  voltage  limit  violation  at  a  bus
