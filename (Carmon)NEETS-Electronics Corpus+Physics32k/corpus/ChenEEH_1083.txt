This chapter surveys some of the current and projected
applications of MEMS. Before getting to these applications,
we consider in the next section the means by which MEMS are
produced. On a macroscopic scale, carpenters do not make
engines, and machinists do not produce buildings. That is, the
characteristics and performance of large engineered systems
depend on the materials and tools used to make them. On
a microscopic scale, the uses of MEMS similarly depend on
the performance speciÔ¨Åcations that result from the design
and manufacturing phases, especially the behavior of materials
