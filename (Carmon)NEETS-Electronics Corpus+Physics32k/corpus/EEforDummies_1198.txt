If you’ve already built some circuits on a solderless breadboard (say, by fol-
lowing the instructions in previous chapters), you may be somewhat of a 
pro by now. You may not need the detailed circuit‐building instructions that 
follow in this section, but it’s still a good idea to read along as I explain how 
to select components for this first circuit.
