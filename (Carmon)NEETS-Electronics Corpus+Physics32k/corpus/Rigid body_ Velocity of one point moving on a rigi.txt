If the point R is moving in rigid body B while B moves in reference frame N, then the velocity of R in N is










N





v



R



=






N





v



Q



+






B





v



R





{\displaystyle {}^{\mathrm {N} }\mathbf {v} ^{\mathrm {R} }={}^{\mathrm {N} }\mathbf {v} ^{\mathrm {Q} }+{}^{\mathrm {B} }\mathbf {v} ^{\mathrm {R} }}

where Q is the point fixed in B that is instantaneously coincident with R at the instant of interest. This relation is often combined with the relation for the Velocity of two points fixed on a rigid body.
