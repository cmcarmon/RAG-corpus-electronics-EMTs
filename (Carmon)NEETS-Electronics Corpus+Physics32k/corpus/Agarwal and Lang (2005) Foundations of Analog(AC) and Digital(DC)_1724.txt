From Figure 12.16, we see that the capacitor voltage is nearly maximum when
the inductor current is zero, and vice versa. A more careful examination of
Equations 12.63 and 12.64, however, reveals that the circuit states are not
exactly in quadrature as they were for the circuit shown in Figure 12.6. In fact,
