By measuring the voltage produced by a tachogenerator, you can easily determine the ro-
tational speed of whatever its mechanically attached to. One of the more common voltage
signal ranges used with tachogenerators is 0 to 10 volts. Obviously, since a tachogenerator
cannot produce voltage when its not turning, the zero cannot be ”live” in this signal standard.
Tachogenerators can be purchased with different ”full-scale” (10 volt) speeds for different ap-
plications. Although a voltage divider could theoretically be used with a tachogenerator to
extend the measurable speed range in the 0-10 volt scale, it is not advisable to signiﬁcantly
overspeed a precision instrument like this, or its life will be shortened.
