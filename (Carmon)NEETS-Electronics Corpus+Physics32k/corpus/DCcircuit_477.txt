In summary, a parallel circuit is deﬁned as one where all components are connected between
the same set of electrically common points. Another way of saying this is that all components
are connected across each other’s terminals. From this deﬁnition, three rules of parallel circuits
follow: all components share the same voltage; resistances diminish to equal a smaller, total
resistance; and branch currents add to equal a larger, total current. Just as in the case of series
circuits, all of these rules ﬁnd root in the deﬁnition of a parallel circuit. If you understand that
deﬁnition fully, then the rules are nothing more than footnotes to the deﬁnition.
