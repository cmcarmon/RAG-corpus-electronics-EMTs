Frequency modulation requires the oscillator frequency to deviate both above and below the carrier
frequency. During the process of frequency modulation, the peaks of each successive cycle in the
modulated waveform occur at times other than they would if the carrier were unmodulated. This is
actually an incidental phase shift that takes place along with the frequency shift in fm. Just the opposite
action takes place in phase modulation. The af signal is applied to a PHASE MODULATOR in pm. The
resultant wave from the phase modulator shifts in phase, as illustrated in figure 2-17. Notice that the time
period of each successive cycle varies in the modulated wave according to the audio-wave variation.
Since frequency is a function of time period per cycle, we can see that such a phase shift in the carrier will
cause its frequency to change. The frequency change in fm is vital, but in pm it is merely incidental. The
amount of frequency change has nothing to do with the resultant modulated wave shape in pm. At this
point the comparison of fm to pm may seem a little hazy, but it will clear up as we progress.
