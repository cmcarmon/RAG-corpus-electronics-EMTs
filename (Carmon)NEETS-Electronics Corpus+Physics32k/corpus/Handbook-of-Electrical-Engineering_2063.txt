Intelligibility maximization and loudness restoration: Two different objectives in Ô¨Åtting hearing aids. Maximiz-
ing intelligibility involves conducting laborious intelligibility tests. Loudness restoration involves measuring
the mapping between a given sound level and its perceived loudness. Here, we assume that recreating the
loudness a normal hearing person would perceive is close to maximizing the intelligibility of speech.
