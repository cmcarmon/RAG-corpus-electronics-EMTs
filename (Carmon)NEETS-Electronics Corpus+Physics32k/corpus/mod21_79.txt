Ohmmeter applications include resistance measurements; continuity checks; and inductor, capacitor,
and transformer checks. A transformer, for example, may be tested by checking whether there is an open
or short, low-insulation resistance to ground, or improper continuity between transformer windings. A
capacitor may be tested to determine whether it is open or shorted. Ensure that capacitors are properly
discharged before you test them; otherwise, damage to the multimeter may occur. When an ohmmeter is
placed in series with a capacitor, the changing current will cause a meter deflection that is proportional to
the capacitance. The deflection obtained is compared with the deflection from a similar capacitor of
known value. This deflection may be small or large, depending on the type and size of the capacitor and
the voltage of the battery within the meter. An external series battery will increase the sensitivity of the
instrument.
