In a low electric ﬁeld, tnp and mn are independent of the
electric ﬁeld, and the electron drift velocity, vn, is proportional
to the electric ﬁeld. However, in high electric ﬁelds when
electrons may gain considerable energy from the electric
ﬁeld, tnp and, in certain cases, mn become strong functions
of the electron energy and, hence, of the electric ﬁeld. In a high
electric ﬁeld, electrons gain energy from the ﬁeld, and their
average energy exceeds the thermal energy (they become
‘‘hot’’).
