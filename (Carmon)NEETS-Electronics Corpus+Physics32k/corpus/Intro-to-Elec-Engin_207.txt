The kind of response of a physical system in an applied excitation depends in general on the
type of excitation, the elements in the system and their interconnection, and also on the past
history of the system. The total response generally consists of a forced response determined by
the particular excitation and its effects on the system elements, and a natural response dictated
by the system elements and their interaction. The natural response caused by the energy storage
elements in circuits with nonzero resistance is always transient; but the forced response caused
by the sources can have a transient and a steady-state component. The boundary conditions
(usually initial conditions), representing the effect of past history in the total response, decide
the amplitude of the natural response and reï¬‚ect the degree of mismatch between the original
state and the steady-state response. However, when excitations are periodic or when they are
applied for lengthy durations, as in the case of many applications, the solution for the forced
response is all that is needed, whereas that for the natural response becomes unnecessary. When
a linear circuit is driven by a sinusoidal voltage or current source, all steady-state voltages
and currents in the circuit are sinusoids with the same frequency as that of the source. This
condition is known as the sinusoidal steady state. Sinusoidal excitation refers to excitation
whose waveform is sinusoidal (or cosinusoidal). Circuits excited by constant currents or voltages
are called dc circuits, whereas those excited by sinusoidal currents or voltages are known as
ac circuits.
