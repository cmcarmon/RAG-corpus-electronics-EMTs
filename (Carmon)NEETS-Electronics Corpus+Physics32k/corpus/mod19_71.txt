When one rescuer performs CPR, as shown in figure 1-4, the ratio of compressions to ventilations is 
15 to 2. After 15 compressions, you must give the victim 2 ventilations. This ratio must continue for four 
full cycles. Then check for pulse and breathing. If there are still no signs of recovery, continue CPR until 
the victim can breathe unassisted or you are relieved by medical personnel.
