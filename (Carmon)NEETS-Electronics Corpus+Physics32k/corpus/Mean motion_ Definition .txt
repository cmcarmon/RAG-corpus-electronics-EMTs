Define the orbital period (the time period for the body to complete one orbit) as P, with dimension of time. The mean motion is simply one revolution divided by this time, or,

or



n

{\displaystyle n={\frac {2\pi }{P}},\qquad n={\frac {360^{\circ }}{P}},\quad {\mbox{or}}\quad n={\frac {1}{P}},}

with dimensions of radians per unit time, degrees per unit time or revolutions per unit time.
The value of mean motion depends on the circumstances of the particular gravitating system. In systems with more mass, bodies will orbit faster, in accordance with Newton's law of universal gravitation. Likewise, bodies closer together will also orbit faster.
