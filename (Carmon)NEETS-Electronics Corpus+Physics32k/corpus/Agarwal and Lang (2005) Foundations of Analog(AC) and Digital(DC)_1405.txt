Transition Interval (t > 0
) We have now sketched the initial and final values
of the capacitor voltage. The transition interval for t > 0
remains to be
analyzed. During this interval, observe that the capacitor voltage cannot jump
instantaneously from VO to V due to the continuity condition. Specifically, we
know from the solution to the homogeneous equation for the RC circuit that
the transient follows an exponential form, either rising (1 − e
−t/RC) or falling
−t/RC), with time constant RC. (For the corresponding inductor-resistor circuit
(e
the time constant will be L/R.) In our case, since V > VO, the transient will be
a rising exponential.
