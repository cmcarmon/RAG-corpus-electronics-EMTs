The speech also contained an observation on the main change brought about by the new regulatory scheme -

"The Bill introduces one important addition to the existing regulatory framework for accident towing -- industry accreditation. This initiative is aimed at improving existing industry performance. A person who wants to undertake a role within the industry either as an accident towing operator, depot manager or tow-truck driver will be required to obtain accreditation from VicRoads to perform the activities associated with that role. The purpose of the accreditation scheme is to provide assurance about a person's ability and credentials to perform that role. It will be an offence to undertake the activities without the appropriate accreditation. An operator will continue to be required to hold a licence for each tow truck being used to operate an accident towing business."
