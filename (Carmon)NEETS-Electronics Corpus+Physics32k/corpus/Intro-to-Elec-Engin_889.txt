Analogous to KVL in electrical circuits, Ampere’s law applied to the analysis of a magnetic
circuit leads to the statement that the algebraic sum of the magnetic potentials around any closed
path is zero. Series, parallel, and series–parallel magnetic circuits can be analyzed by means of
their corresponding electric-circuit analogs. All methods of analysis that are valid for dc resistive
circuits can be effectively utilized in an analogous manner.
