A transmission line is a distributed circuit element. Unlike a
conventional low-frequency circuit, the voltages and currents
on a transmission line vary with longitudinal position because
they experience a phase (or time) delay as the wave propagates
from one end of the line to the other. This effect becomes
important when the line length becomes an appreciable frac-
tion of the wavelength at the operating frequency. Consider the
circuit shown in Figure 4.4, where a lossless transmission line
of length ‘ is connected between an ideal generator and a load
resistance, RL. For simplicity, the load is assumed to be
matched to Z0, the characteristic impedance of the line, so
that there is no reﬂected wave.
