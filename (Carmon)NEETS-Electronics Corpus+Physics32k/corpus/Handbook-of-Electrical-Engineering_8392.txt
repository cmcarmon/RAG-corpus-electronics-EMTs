Chapter 98 discusses the overall reliability of computer systems, based on the inevitable limitations of both
hardware and software mentioned earlier. Given the inevitability of failure, human or component, what can
be  said  about  the  probability  of  a  whole  computer  system  failing?  This  may  not  be  an  academic  issue  for  a
passenger reading this section while ﬂying in a modern jet airliner, which may spend over 95% of a ﬂight under
the  control  of  an  automatic  pilot.  He  or  she  may  be  reassured  to  know,  however,  that  the  practitioners  of
reliability engineering have reduced the risk of system failure to truly negligible proportions.
