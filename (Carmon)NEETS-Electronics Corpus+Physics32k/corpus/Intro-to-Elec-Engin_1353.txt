A low-noise transducer is connected to an instrumentation system by a cable that generates thermal
noise at room temperature. The information-bearing signal has a bandwidth of 6 kHz. The signal
power delivered is Pin = 120 pW. Evaluate the condition on the ampliÔ¨Åer noise temperature Ta
such that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is greater than or equal to 50 dB.
