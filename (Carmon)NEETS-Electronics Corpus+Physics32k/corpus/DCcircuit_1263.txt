If the potentiometer mechanism remains in a single position (wiper is stationary), the volt-
meter connected across the capacitor will register a constant (unchanging) voltage, and the
ammeter will register 0 amps. In this scenario, the instantaneous rate of voltage change (dv/dt)
is equal to zero, because the voltage is unchanging. The equation tells us that with 0 volts per
second change for a dv/dt, there must be zero instantaneous current (i). From a physical per-
spective, with no change in voltage, there is no need for any electron motion to add or subtract
charge from the capacitorâ€™s plates, and thus there will be no current.
