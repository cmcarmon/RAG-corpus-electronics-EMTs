the product modulator of Figure
14.2.4(a), where
generates
cos[2π(fc+f )t+φ] in which f and φ are
synchronization errors. Find z(t) produced by the
following inputs, when fm = 1 kHz, f = 200
Hz, and φ = 0:
(a) DSB input xc(t ) = 4 cos 2πfmt cos 2πfct.
(b) Upper-sideband SSB input xc(t ) = 2 cos
(c) Lower-sideband SSB input xc(t ) = 2 cos
