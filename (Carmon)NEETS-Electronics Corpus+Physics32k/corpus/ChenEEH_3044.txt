The West European Power Grid is shown in Figure 1.4. The
separate regions are again connected with dc ties. The largest
synchronously operating grid is that of continental Europe
recently enlarged by the interconnecting of some of the Eastern
European countries that disconnected from the old Soviet grid
to interconnect with the West. The installed generation capac-
ity is 512 GW with 125,000 miles of transmission.
