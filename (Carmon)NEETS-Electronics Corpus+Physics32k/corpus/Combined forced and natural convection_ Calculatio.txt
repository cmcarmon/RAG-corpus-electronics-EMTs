While it may seem like it is possible to simply add or subtract the heat transfer values to or from each other, this will yield inaccurate results. In order to determine the total heat transfer, experimental data has suggested that Nucombined=(Nuforcedn Â± Nunaturaln)(1/n) where the plus sign is for cases where heat transfer is assisted (i.e. case one and three) and the minus sign is for when it is hindered (i.e. case two). The value of n ranges between 3 and 4 as the geometry aligns from vertically to horizontally respectively.
