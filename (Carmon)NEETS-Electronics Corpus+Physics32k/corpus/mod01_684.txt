The danger of shock from a 450-volt ac electrical service system is well recognized by operating
personnel. This is shown by the relatively low number of reports of serious shock received from this
voltage, despite its widespread use. On the other hand, a number of fatalities have been reported due to
contact with low-voltage circuits. Despite a fairly widespread, but totally unfounded, popular belief to the
contrary, low-voltage circuits (115 volts and below) are very dangerous and can cause death when the
resistance of the body is lowered. Fundamentally, current, rather than voltage, is the measure of shock
intensity. The passage of even a very small current through a vital part of the human body can cause
DEATH. The voltage necessary to produce the fatal current is dependent upon the resistance of the body,
contact conditions, the path through the body, etc. For example, when a 60-hertz alternating current, is
passed through a human body from hand to hand or from hand to foot, and the current is gradually
increased, it will cause the following effects: At about 1 milliampere (0.001 ampere), the shock can be
felt; at about 10 milliamperes (0.01 ampere), the shock is of sufficient intensity to prevent voluntary
control of the muscles; and at about 100 milliamperes (0.1 ampere) the shock is fatal if it lasts for 1
second or more. The above figures are the results of numerous investigations and are approximate
because individuals differ in their resistance to electrical shock. It is most important to recognize that the
resistance of the human body cannot be relied upon to prevent a fatal shock from 115 volts or lessâ€”
FATALITIES FROM VOLTAGES AS LOW AS 30 VOLTS HAVE BEEN RECORDED. Tests have
shown that body resistance under unfavorable conditions may be as low as 300 ohms, and possibly as low
as 100 ohms from temple to temple if the skin is broken.
