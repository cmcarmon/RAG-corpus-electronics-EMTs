When a central processing unit (CPU) sends data to a serial
device (receiver) through a RS-232 interface, the data will go
through internal busses, external busses, a RS-232 interface, a
serial cable, a receiver’s RS-232 interface, a receiver’s busses,
and a receiver’s CPU. Normally, a component (e.g., interface
card) that is used to transfer signals from busses to some
protocol can be recognized by other components or peripheral
devices. The interface card will be plugged into an expansion
bus slot of a motherboard. Normally, a motherboard has
several expansion bus slots allowing components such as a
video card, a disk controller, a modern, or a parallel-port
card to communicate with the computer. There are three
