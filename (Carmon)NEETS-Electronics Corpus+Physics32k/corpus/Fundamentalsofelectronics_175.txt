Léon Charles Thévenin: He was an engineer with France’s Postes, Télégraphe et Téléphone. In
1883, he published (twice!) a proof of what is now called the Thévenin equivalent while developing
ways of teaching electrical engineering concepts at the École Polytechnique. He did not realize that
the same result had been published by Hermann Helmholtz,15 the renowned nineteenth century
physicist, thirty years earlier.
