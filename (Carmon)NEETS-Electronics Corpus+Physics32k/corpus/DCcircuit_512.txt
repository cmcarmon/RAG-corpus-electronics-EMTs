This technique, however, proves impractical for circuits much more complex than this, due
to the awkwardness of the jumper wires and the physical fragility of their connections. A more
common method of temporary construction for the hobbyist is the solderless breadboard, a
device made of plastic with hundreds of spring-loaded connection sockets joining the inserted
ends of components and/or 22-gauge solid wire pieces. A photograph of a real breadboard is
shown here, followed by an illustration showing a simple series circuit constructed on one:
