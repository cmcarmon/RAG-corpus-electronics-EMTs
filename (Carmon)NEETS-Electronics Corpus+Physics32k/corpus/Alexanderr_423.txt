for  the  parallel  RLC cir-
cuit as shown above, we can readily obtain other circuit quantities such
as  individual  element  currents.  For  example,  the  resistor  current  is
iR ⫽ v兾R
We have selected
as the key variable to be determined ﬁrst in
the capacitor voltage 
order  to  take  advantage  of  Eq.  (8.1a).  Notice  that  we  ﬁrst  found  the
for the RLC series circuit, whereas we ﬁrst found
inductor current
