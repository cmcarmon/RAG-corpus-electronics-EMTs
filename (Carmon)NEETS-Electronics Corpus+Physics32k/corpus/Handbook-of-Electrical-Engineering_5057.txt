Sensors are most often classiﬁed by the type of measurand, i.e., physical, chemical, or biological. This is a
much simpler means of classiﬁcation than by transduction mechanism or output signal (e.g., digital or analog),
since  many  sensors  use  multiple  transduction  mechanisms  and  the  output  signal  can  always  be  processed,
conditioned, or converted by a circuit so as to cloud the deﬁnition of output. A description of each class and
examples are given in the following sections. The last section introduces microsensors and gives some examples.
