In general, Ohm's law cannot be applied to alternating-current circuits since it does not consider the 
reactance which is always present in such circuits. However, by a modification of Ohm's law which does 
take into consideration the effect of reactance we obtain a general law which is applicable to ac circuits. 
Because the impedance, Z, represents the combined opposition of all the reactances and resistances, this 
general law for ac is,
