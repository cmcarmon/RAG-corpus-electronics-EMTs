Here is a list of possible effective strategies to deal with Attractiveness principle in praxis based on.
Knowing the growth is limited is the first step.
The insight is complicated by mutual interaction of limits, so analysis of their relation should be a priority. Such an analysis can also reveal possible synergies that can be achieved by allocating resources to carefully chosen limits.
Consider replacing limited resources by another ones.
Dominant strategy is to monitor the limits and using tradeoff analysis for deciding which of them it is convenient to reduce or remove to obtain desired results.
Define the acceptable level of (un)attraction.
Slowing actions are not usually appearing at the same time so it is important to manage them through the time.
Try to inhibit the limits before they even start to act like limits.
As limits start to have impact on various levels of results it is important to keep the right timing – intercept the moment when the limit starts playing its role but not waste the resources to avoid its impact unless it is necessary.
It is important to have in mind that dynamic complexity is very often counterintuitive – cause and effect are distant in time and space, but decision-makers rather tend to look for causes “near” their effects. The solution is not to concentrate on the symptoms of the problem, but on its causes.
