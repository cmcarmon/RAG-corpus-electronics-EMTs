In the most elementary form of the fault analysis problem,
assume that S(v) is given at only a single frequency and
compute Z(v) exactly. This form of the problem was ﬁrst
studied by Saeks (1970) and then extended by Saeks and
colleagues (Ransom and Saeks, 1975; Saeks et al., 1972). Its
solution is based on the observation that the connection func-
tion f can be decomposed into two functions (under the
assumption that L22 ¼ 0) as:
