Schematic symbols are followed with a reference	
designator that identifies a component in an electri-
cal schematic diagram or on a printed circuit board 
(PCB). The reference designator usually consists of 
one or two letters followed by a subscript number, for 
example, R2, C1, S4, IR1, and so on. Reference designa-
tors followed by a subscript number and letter indicate 
a component with several sections tied to a common 
point, for example, S1A, R2B, and so forth.
