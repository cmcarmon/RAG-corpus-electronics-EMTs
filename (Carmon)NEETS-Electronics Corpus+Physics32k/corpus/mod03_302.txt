described, figure 2-1 shows other fuse types. While the variety of fuses may seem confusing, there are
basically only two types of fuses: plug-type fuses and cartridge fuses. Both types of fuses use either a
single wire or a ribbon as the fuse element (the part of the fuse that melts). The condition (good or bad) of
some fuses can be determined by visual inspection. The condition of other fuses can only be determined
with a meter. In the following discussion, visual inspection will be described. The use of meters to check
fuses will be discussed later in this chapter.
