Despite the structural similarities, a pnp BJT has smaller current gain than a comparable npn
BJT because holes are less mobile than electrons. Most applications of pnp BJTs involve pairing
them with npn BJTs to take advantage of complementary operation. The large-signal models of
Figure 7.3.8 also hold for pnp BJTs if all voltages, currents, and battery polarities are reversed.
BJTs can provide the circuit properties of a controlled source or a switch.
