Semiconductor Material Properties
Active device operation is strongly dependent upon the charge transport characteristics of the semiconductor
materials from which the device is fabricated. Semiconductor materials can be grown in single crystals with
very high purity. The electrical conductivity of the crystal can be precisely controlled by introduction of minute
quantities of dopant impurities. When these impurities are electrically activated, they permit precise values of
current ﬂow through the crystals to be controlled by potentials applied to contacts, placed upon the crystals.
By clever positioning of the metal contacts, various types of semiconductor devices are fabricated. In this section
we will brieﬂy discuss the important material characteristics.
