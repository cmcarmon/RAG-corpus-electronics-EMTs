Vmin (verification minimum)
See minimum verification interval.
volatile memory
A data storage component in computers, in which stored contents are lost when there is a loss of power.
volt

The unit of voltage, potential difference and electromotive force. One volt will send a current of one ampere through a resistance of one ohm.

voltage

The electrical potential difference that exists between two points, and is capable of producing a flow of current when a closed circuit is connected between the two points.

voltage dip
A temporary decrease in voltage level which lasts for at least one alternating current (AC) cycle.
voltage spike

A large and destructive voltage pulse caused by lightning strikes on a power line, communication line, signal or sensing line, or even nearby ground.

voltage surge
A temporary rise in voltage level which lasts for at least one alternating current (AC) cycle.
