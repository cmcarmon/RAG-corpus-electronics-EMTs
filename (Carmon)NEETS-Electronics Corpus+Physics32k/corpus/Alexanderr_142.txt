When all sources in a circuit are independent current sources, we
do  not  need  to  apply  KCL to  each  node  to  obtain  the  node-voltage
equations  as  we  did  in  Section  3.2.  We  can  obtain  the  equations  by
mere inspection of the circuit. As an example, let us reexamine the cir-
cuit  in  Fig.  3.2,  shown  again  in  Fig.  3.26(a)  for  convenience.  The
circuit  has  two  nonreference  nodes  and  the  node  equations  were
derived in Section 3.2 as
