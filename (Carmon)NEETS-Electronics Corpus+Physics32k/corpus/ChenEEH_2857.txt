In some civilian applications, such as navigation, it is desirable
to enhance the radar echo of the object so that it can be easily
detected or tracked. The metal corner reﬂectors are usually
used for this purpose because their RCSs have large values over
a wide angular coverage. On the contrary, for electronic war-
fare and electronic countermeasure, it is desirable to reduce
the RCS of military targets so that they will not be detected
by the radar. There are several ways to reduce the RCS of a
target: shaping, absorbing, and cancelling. Shaping includes
speciﬁc design conﬁguration, such as placing engine intakes
where they can be shielded by other parts of the object. The
purpose of the radar absorber is to absorb incident energy
and thereby reduce the energy scattered back to the radar.
Cancellation methods require loading the object with suitable
impedance to cancel the returns from other parts of the body.
Cancellation methods are too complicated to implement and
are seldom used.
