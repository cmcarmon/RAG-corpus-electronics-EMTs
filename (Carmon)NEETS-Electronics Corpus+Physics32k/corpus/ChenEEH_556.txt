Considering that the pþ junction is 5 mm deep into the n-type
drift region, the diode forms a cylindrical junction at the edge,
with a radius of 5 mm. This gives a ratio of 0.14 with the ideal
parallel plane breakdown depletion width. Then, using
equation 7.4a,
the ﬁnite device will have a cylindrical
breakdown voltage that is 40% of the ideal parallel plane
breakdown. In this case, the ﬁnite device has a breakdown
voltage of 200 V.
