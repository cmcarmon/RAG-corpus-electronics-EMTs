where 
is known as the resistivity of the material in ohm-meters. Good
conductors, such as copper and aluminum, have low resistivities, while
insulators,  such  as  mica  and  paper,  have  high  resistivities.  Table  2.1
presents the values of 
for some common materials and shows which
materials are used for conductors, insulators, and semiconductors.
