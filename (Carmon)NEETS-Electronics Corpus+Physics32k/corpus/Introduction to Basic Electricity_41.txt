to	unwanted	inductance	coupling,	as	well	as	a	power	overload.
It	can,	therefore,	be	deduced	that	mutual	inductance	(as	represented	by	the	symbol
M)	is	the	measurement	of	the	coupling	that	involves	2	inductors;	the	2	inductors
are,	then,	given	particular	importance	(in	terms	of	coil	turns),	along	with	each
inductorâ€™s	ability	to	admit	current	flow	or	permeance.	The	formula	for	calculating
mutual	inductance	is	as	follows:
**representations:														MAB	=	mutual	inductance	in	circuit	A	and	circuit	B
