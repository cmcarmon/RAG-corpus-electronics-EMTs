Sensitivity plays a vital role in the characterization of RC-active ﬁlters. It provides a measure of the extent
to which a change in the value of any given component affects the response of the ﬁlter. High sensitivity in an
RC-active ﬁlter should also alert the designer to the possibility of oscillation. A nominally stable design will be
unstable in practical realization if sensitivities are such that component value errors cause one or more pairs
of poles to migrate into the right half plane. Because any practical ﬁlter will be built with components that are
not exactly nominal in value, sensitivity information provides a practical and useful indication of how different
ﬁlter structures will react and provides a basis for comparison.
