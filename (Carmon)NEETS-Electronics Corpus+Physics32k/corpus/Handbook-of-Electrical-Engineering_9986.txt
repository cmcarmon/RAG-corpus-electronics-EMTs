Relay with Dead Zone and Hysteresis
The characteristic is shown in Fig. 100.44 together with the corresponding input, assumed equal to a cos q,
and the corresponding output wave form. Using Eqs. (100.102) and (100.103) over the interval -p/2 to p/2 and
assuming that the input amplitude a is greater than d + D,
