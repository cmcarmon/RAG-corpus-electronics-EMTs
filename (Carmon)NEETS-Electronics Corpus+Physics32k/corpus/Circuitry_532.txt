sequence  of  instruction  fetch  and  execute  cycles. 
The act of fetching an instruction code (or operand 
or  data  value)  from  memory  involves  a  read 
operation  whilst  the  act  of  moving  data  from  the 
microprocessor  to  a  memory  location  involves  a 
write operation â€“ see Fig. 11.6. 
  Each  cycle  of  CPU  operation  is  known  as  a 
machine  cycle.  Program  instructions  may  require 
several machine cycles (typically between two and 
five). The first machine cycle in any cycle consists 
of an instruction fetch (the instruction code is read 
from the memory) and it is known as the M1 cycle. 
Subsequent cycles M2, M3, and so on, depend on 
the type of instruction that is being executed. This 
fetch-execute sequence is shown in Fig. 11.7. 
  Microprocessors  determine  the  source  of  data 
(when it is being read) and the destination of data 
(when  it  is  being  written)  by  placing  a  unique 
address  on  the  address  bus.  The  address  at  which 
the data is to be placed (during a write operation) or 
from  which  it  is  to  be  fetched  (during  a  read 
operation) can either constitute part of the memory 
of the system (in which case it may be within ROM
