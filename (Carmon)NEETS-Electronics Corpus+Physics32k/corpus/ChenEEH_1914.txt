with regard to increasing fault probabilities, but maintenance
is either very difÔ¨Åcult or impossible to perform during the
operation of these systems. This underscores the need for
very high MTTF computer systems in these applications, and
REMOD is a means to achieving this in the execution part of a
system. It is also a means to increase the availability of more
general purpose computer systems and to reduce their main-
tenance costs.
