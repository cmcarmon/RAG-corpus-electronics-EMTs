Ground radar systems were
already  known  and  used  by
the  military.  These  involved
a highly directional antenna
alternately  coupled  to  a
transmitter and receiver with
the antenna swept in a radial
fashion.  The  display  con-
sisted  of  a  cathode  ray  tube
with  targets  represented  by
radial sweeps from the center
of the screen. Dr. Alvarez took
on  the  special  problem  of
panoramic  presentation  of
ground targets from aircraft.
He  solved  the  computation
and display problems associ-
ated  with  the  hyperbolic
shape of the radar beams as
transmitted and received from a moving aircraft. He also described handling pitch, roll, yaw, and other
disturbances. (Copyright Â© 1995, DewRay Products, Inc. Used with permission.)
