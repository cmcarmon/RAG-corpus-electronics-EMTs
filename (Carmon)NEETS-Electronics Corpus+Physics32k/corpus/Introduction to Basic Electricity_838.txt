Simple page layouts can be done in a word proces-
sor, but word processors are best used for working 
with text and not for page layout. Additionally, word 
processing file formats are generally not suitable for 
printing commercially. A word processor can import 
and export a  variety of formats for compatibility with 
other programs.
