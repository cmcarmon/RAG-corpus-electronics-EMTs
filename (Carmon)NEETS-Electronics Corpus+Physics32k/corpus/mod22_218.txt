Each picture element is addressable by a row and column address. Picture elements are numbered 
from left to right on each horizontal line (column number). Each horizontal line has a row number. 
Picture elements, at a minimum, will have off (blanked) or on (full intensity) states. Many display devices 
have the capability to display picture elements at varying degrees of intensity for the display of graphics.
