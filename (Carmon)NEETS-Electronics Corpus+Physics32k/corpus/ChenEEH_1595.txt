Among the various types of models, qualitative models have
been the focus of model-based reasoning in AI. They are useful
in the situations where the quantitative models are impossible
to develop due to lack of knowledge or are prohibitively
computationally expensive. They may also correspond to the
common sense knowledge better than abstract mathematical
models. The major approaches in building qualitative models
and related reasoning systems are the following:
