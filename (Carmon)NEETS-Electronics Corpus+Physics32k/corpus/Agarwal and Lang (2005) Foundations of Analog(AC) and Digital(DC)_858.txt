Figures 6.33 and 6.34 show sketches of two views of the physical structure
of an n-channel MOSFET. An n-channel MOSFET is constructed on the surface
of p-type silicon called the substrate. Two n
doped regions separated by a
small distance (for example, 0.07 Âµ in digital devices, and quite a bit larger in
