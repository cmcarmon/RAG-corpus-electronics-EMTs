The disk was assumed to be fully covered with information-carrying marks. This is generally not the case
in  practice.  Consider  a  disk  rotating  at 1 revolutions  per  second  (rps).  For  reasons  to  be  clariﬁed  later,  this
rotational  speed  should  remain  constant  during  the  disk  operation.  Let  the  electronic  circuitry  have  a  ﬁxed
clock duration Tc. Then only pulses of length Tc (or an integer multiple thereof) may be used for writing. Now,
a mark written along a track of radius r, with a pulse-width equal to Tc , will have length ,, where
