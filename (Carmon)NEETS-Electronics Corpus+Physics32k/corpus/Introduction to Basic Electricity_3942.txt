In receiving equipment, the RF amplifier serves to 
amplify the signal and select the proper frequency. In 
transmitters, the RF amplifier serves to amplify a sin-
gle frequency for application to the antenna. Basically, 
the receiver RF amplifier is a voltage amplifier, and the 
transmitter RF amplifier is a power amplifier.
