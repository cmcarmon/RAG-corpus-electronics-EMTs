it to be able to distinguish between a fault just inside the zone and a fault just outside the zone, near bus B.
This problem is solved by providing a two-zone scheme, such that if a fault is detected to be in zone 1, the relay
trips instantaneously, and if the fault is detected to be inside zone 2, the relay trips with a time delay of about
0.3 s. Thus for faults near the zone boundary, the fault is cleared with this time delay, while for near faults, the
clearing is instantaneous. This arrangement is referred to as a step-distance protection scheme, consisting of an
underreaching zone (zone 1), and an overreaching zone (zone 2). The relays of the neighboring line (BC) can
also be backed up by a third zone of the relay, which reaches beyond the zone of protection of relay Rbc. Zone 3
operation is delayed further to allow the zone 1 or zone 2 of Rbc to operate and clear the fault on line BC.
