P = Number of distinct operators appearing in the program
p = Total number of operators appearing in the program
Q = Number of distinct operands appearing in the program
q = Total number of operands appearing in the program
N = Number of operators and operands appearing in the program
V = Volume = N log2(P + Q)
L = Level of abstraction used to write the program Â» (2/P)*(Q/q)
l = Level of the HLL used to write the program = L2V
E = Mental effort to create the program = V/L
