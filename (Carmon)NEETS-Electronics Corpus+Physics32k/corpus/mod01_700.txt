Once it has been determined that breathing has stopped, the person nearest the victim should start the
artificial ventilation without delay and send others for assistance and medical aid. The only logical,
permissible delay is that required to free the victim from contact with the electricity in the quickest, safest
way. This step, while it must be taken quickly, must be done with great care; otherwise, there may be two
victims instead of one. In the case of portable electric tools, lights, appliances, equipment, or portable
outlet extensions, this should be done by turning off the supply switch or by removing the plug from its
receptacle. If the switch or receptacle cannot be quickly located, the suspected electrical device may be
pulled free of the victim. Other persons arriving on the scene must be clearly warned not to touch the
suspected equipment until it is deenergized. Aid should be enlisted to unplug the device as soon as
possible. The injured person should be pulled free of contact with stationary equipment (such as a bus
bar) if the equipment cannot be quickly deenergized, or if considerations of military operation or unit
survival prevent immediate shutdown of the circuits.
