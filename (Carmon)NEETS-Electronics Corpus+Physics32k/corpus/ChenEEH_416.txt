These equations need to be compared with those of the inte-
grators, equation 4.34, to determine the element values. Since
C1 ¼ C3 and RS ¼ RL, the ﬁrst and last lossy integrators are the
same. The comparison yields C1RS ¼ C3RS ¼ t ¼ CARa, q1 ¼
q3 ¼ GS=RS ¼ 1, C2RS ¼ t2 ¼ L2=RS,
If we
select3Ra ¼ RS ¼ 1 kV, we
and
S ¼ 30 nF. The value of r is unimportant; let us
C2 ¼ L2=R2
choose r ¼ 1 kV so that all resistors have the same value.
The ﬁnal circuit is shown in Figure 4.15(C). Notice that each
loop combines the inverting and noninverting integrators,
which we used earlier to construct the Ackerberg-Mossberg
