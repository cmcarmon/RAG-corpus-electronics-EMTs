The same mass number implies neither the same mass of nuclei, nor equal atomic masses of corresponding nuclides. From the Weizsäcker's formula for the mass of a nucleus

{\displaystyle m(A,Z)=Zm_{p}+Nm_{n}-a_{V}A+a_{S}A^{2/3}+a_{C}{\frac {Z^{2}}{A^{1/3}}}+a_{A}{\frac {(N-Z)^{2}}{A}}-\delta (A,Z)}

where mass number A equals to the sum of atomic number Z and number of neutrons N, and mp, mn, aV, aS, aC, aA are constants, one can see that the mass depends on Z and N non-linearly, even for a constant mass number. For odd A, it is admitted that δ = 0 and the mass dependence on Z is convex (or on N or N − Z, it does not matter for a constant A). This explains that beta-decay is energetically favorable for neutron-rich nuclides, and positron decay is favorable for strongly neutron-deficient nuclides. Both decay modes do not change the mass number, hence an original nucleus and its daughter nucleus are isobars. In both aforementioned cases, a heavier nucleus decays to its lighter isobar.
For even A the δ term has the form:

{\displaystyle \delta (A,Z)=(-1)^{Z}a_{P}A^{-{\frac {1}{2}}}}

where aP is another constant. This term, subtracted from the mass expression above, is positive for even-even nuclei and negative for odd-odd nuclei. This means that even-even nuclei, which have not a strong neutron excess or neutron deficiency, have higher binding energy than their odd-odd isobar neighbors. It implies that even-even nuclei are (relatively) lighter and more stable. The difference is especially strong for small A. This effect is also predicted (qualitatively) by other nuclear models and has important consequences.
