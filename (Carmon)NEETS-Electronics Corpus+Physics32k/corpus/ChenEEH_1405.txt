McKay and Singh (1998) have used partial evaluation tech-
niques to optimize circuits that have slowly changing inputs.
They are able to achieve about a 60% increase in clock speed
for a parallel multiplier circuit performing just a single level of
partial evaluation. Others have also used partial evaluation
techniques in compilation tools (Shirazi et al., 2000) and in
application development (Shirazi et al., 1998b).
