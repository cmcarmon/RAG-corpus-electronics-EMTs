When you first learned to add numbers, you memorized facts such as  
“2 + 2 = 4” and “3 + 6 = 9.” Then, when you learned to add multi‐digit 
 numbers, you used those simple facts as well as a new one — “carrying” 
numbers to us older folks, “regrouping” numbers to the younger generation. 
By applying a few simple addition facts and one simple rule, you can add 
two large numbers together fairly easily.
