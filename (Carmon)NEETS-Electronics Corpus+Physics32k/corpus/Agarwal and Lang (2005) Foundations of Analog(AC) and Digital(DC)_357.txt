To determine the network resistance, we turn the network into a complete circuit by
connecting a hypothetical current source to its terminals as shown in Figure 2.53. Note
that the circuit in Figure 2.53 is now much the same as the circuit in Figure 2.25; the two
circuits differ only in the complexity of the resistive network across the current source.
Next, we compute the voltage across the port that appears in response to the application
of the current source. The ratio of this voltage to the source current is then the equivalent
resistance of the network as viewed through the port. Note that this procedure does
work as desired for the circuit in Figure 2.25 since the division of Equation 2.22 by I
yields v2/I = R.
