In this section we give an overview of digital testing techniques with appropriate reference to material containing
all details of the methodology and algorithms. First, we present a general introduction of terminology and a
taxonomy of testing methods. Next, we present a deﬁnition of fault models, and ﬁnally we discuss the main
approaches for test pattern generation and data compaction, respectively.
