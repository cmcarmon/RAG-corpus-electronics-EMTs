The frequency control section accomplishes the tuning of the first and second LOs within the
converter section. The frequency immediately being analyzed is controlled by the current frequencies of
the LOs. To analyze another frequency, you must change an LO frequency to allow the new frequency to
be converted to a 10 MHz signal by the converter section. Periodically, the unit sweeps and analyzes a
frequency range centered on the frequency set by the FREQUENCY knob. Adjusting the FREQUENCY
knob will cause the LOs to be tuned to the new frequency. Only the LOs of the first two converters can be
changed to vary the frequency being analyzed.
