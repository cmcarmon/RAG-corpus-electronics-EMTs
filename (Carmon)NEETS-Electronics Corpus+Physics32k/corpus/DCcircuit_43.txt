This relative mobility of electrons within a material is known as electric conductivity. Con-
ductivity is determined by the types of atoms in a material (the number of protons in each
atomâ€™s nucleus, determining its chemical identity) and how the atoms are linked together with
one another. Materials with high electron mobility (many free electrons) are called conductors,
while materials with low electron mobility (few or no free electrons) are called insulators.
