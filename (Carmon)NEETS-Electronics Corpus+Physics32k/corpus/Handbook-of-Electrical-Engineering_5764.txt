4. Develop  a  protective  or  corrective  control  for  voltage  instability. A  protective  control  would  use  con-
straints on the current operating condition for contingencies predicted to cause voltage instability if they
occurred. These constraints on the current operation would prevent voltage instability if and when the
contingency  occurred. A  corrective  control  would  develop  a  control  that  correct  the  instability  in  the
bifurcation subsystems experiencing instability only after the equipment outages or operating changes
predicted  to  produce  voltage  instability  have  occurred.  The  implementation  of  the  corrective  control
requires a regional 5-s updated data acquisition system and control implementation similar to that used
in Electricit√© de France and elsewhere in Europe.
