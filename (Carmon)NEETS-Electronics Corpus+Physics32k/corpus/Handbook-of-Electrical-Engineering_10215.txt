The issues involved with intelligent robots have been surveyed by Nitzan [1985], where he notes that future
proliferation of robotic applications will depend strongly on machine (robotic) intelligence. Such applications
will lead to a greater diversity of applications and will not be just manufacturing oriented. The reader is also
referred to work on intelligent machines by Weisbin [1986]. It should be noted that particular interest has been
directed toward integration of multiple sensors as a means to enhance robot intelligence [Luo and Lin, 1989;
Pin et al., 1991]. The text by Klafter et al. [1989] categorizes the major sensory needs for robotic tasks and gives
valuable insights to current and future robotics applications. Intelligent control systems, particularly hierar-
chical control systems, are being developed by many organizations and research institutes [Odrey, 1992b]. Such
systems are expected to have an impact both at the shop-ï¬‚oor level and the management levels of production
facilities well into the next century.
