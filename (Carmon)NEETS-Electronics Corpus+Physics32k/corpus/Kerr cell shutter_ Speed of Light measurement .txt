The Kerr Cell shutter was used in the 1920-40s to measure the speed of light. A beam of light is timed between an emitter and receiver while passing through a Kerr Cell. When the cell is activated the light beam is diverted and takes a different path to the receiver, this time difference is measured and the speed of light is calculated based on knowledge of the expected return time.
