We are so lazy that we enter reciprocal resistances and sums of reciprocal resistances into
the octave “A” matrix, letting octave compute the matrix of conductances after “A=”.[4] The
initial entry line was so long that it was split into three rows. This is different than previous
examples. The entered “A” matrix is delineated by starting and ending square brackets. Col-
umn elements are space separated. Rows are “new line” separated. Commas and semicolons
are not need as separators. Though, the current vector at “b” is semicolon separated to yield a
column vector of currents.
