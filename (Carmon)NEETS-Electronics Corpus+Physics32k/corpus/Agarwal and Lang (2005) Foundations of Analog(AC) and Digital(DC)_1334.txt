and so energy is always lost during the closure of the switch, except for the
special case in which v1 and v2 are equal before the switch closes. Where the lost
energy goes is not apparent from Figure 9.51 because it is an idealized figure.
Perhaps the energy is dissipated in the wires used to connect the two capacitors
and the switch. Or, perhaps it is dissipated in a spark as the switch closes. It
might even be lost as radiated electromagnetic energy. In any case, it is lost.
One of the problems at the end of this chapter explores this loss further.
