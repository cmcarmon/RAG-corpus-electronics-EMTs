This chapter explores different ways to connect 
 electronic components so you can direct — and 
redirect — electric current. First, you look at the 
two basic types of circuit structures — series and 
parallel — and discover that parallel connections 
are like alternate traffic routes, whereas series con-
nections are like bridge crossings. Then you find 
out how switches act like traffic cops — allowing, 
preventing, or redirecting current flow. Finally, you 
put it all together by building a circuit that imitates a 
manually controlled three‐stage traffic signal.
