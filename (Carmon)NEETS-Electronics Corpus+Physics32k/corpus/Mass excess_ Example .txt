Consider the nuclear fission of 236U into 92Kr, 141Ba, and three neutrons.
236U → 92Kr + 141Ba + 3 n
The mass number of the reactant, 236U, is 236. Because the actual mass is 236.045563 u, its mass excess is +0.045563 u. Calculated in the same manner, the mass excess for the products, 92Kr, 141Ba, and three neutrons, are −0.073843 u, −0.085588 u and 3 × 0.008665 u = +0.025994 u, respectively, for a total mass excess of −0.133437 u. The difference between the mass excess of the reactants and that of the products is 0.179000 u, which shows that the mass excess of the products is less than that of the reactants, and so the fission can occur – a calculation which could have also been done with only the masses of the reactants.
The mass excess can be converted into energy using 1 u = 931.494 MeV/c2, and E = mc2, yielding 166.737 MeV.
