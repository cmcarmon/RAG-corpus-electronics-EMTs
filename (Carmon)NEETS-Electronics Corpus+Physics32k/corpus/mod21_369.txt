Flow calorimeters are classified by the type of circulating method used (open or closed), the type of 
heating used (direct or indirect), and the type of measurement performed (true calorimetric or 
substitution). Water or other calorimetric fluid is used only once in an open system. An overflow system 
is used to maintain a constant rate of flow. Closed systems recirculate the fluid continuously by means of 
a pump, and a cooling system restores the fluid to ambient temperatures prior to its return to the 
calorimeter. Closed systems are more elaborate and permit the use of fluids other than water.
