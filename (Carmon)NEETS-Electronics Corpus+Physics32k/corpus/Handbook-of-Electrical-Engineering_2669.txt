Technology Generations
The  concept  of  a  technology  generation  emerged  from  analysis  of  historical  records,  was  clearly  deﬁned  by
Gordon  Moore  in  the  1960s,  and  codiﬁed  as  Moore’s  law.  The  current  version  of  the  law  is  that  succeeding
generations  will  support  a  four  times  increase  in  circuit  complexity,  and  that  new  generations  emerge  at
approximately 3-year intervals. The associated observations are that linear dimensions of device features change
by a factor of 0.7, and the economically viable die size grows by a factor of 1.6.
