Information of interest includes operating status and existing or historical fault information. “Events” may
include faults and also other expected actions that may or may not be considered faults. Historical information
can  include  faults,  events,  and  the  status  of  parameters  of  interest  associated  with  the  fault.  The  amount  of
information that can be captured is limited only by the amount of memory provided and the speed at which
it can be transferred. Typically, some (or all) of the memory is in a form that will allow the fault data to be
preserved after power is lost or vehicles are shut down between operating periods.
