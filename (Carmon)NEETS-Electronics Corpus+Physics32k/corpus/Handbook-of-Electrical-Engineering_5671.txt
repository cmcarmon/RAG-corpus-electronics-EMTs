Transmission Voltage Criteria
Transmission voltages should be maintained within suitable ranges for both normal and reasonable emergency
conditions. Abnormal transmission voltages can cause damage or malfunction of transmission equipment such
as  circuit  breakers  or  transformers  and  adversely  affect  many  customers.  Low  transmission  voltages  tend  to
cause low distribution voltages, which in turn cause increased distribution losses as well as higher motor currents
at  customer  loads  and  at  power  plant  auxiliaries.  Transmission  voltage  planning  criteria  are  intended  to  be
conservative.
