In the special case where the Prandtl number and turbulent Prandtl number both equal unity (as in the Reynolds analogy), the velocity profile and temperature profiles are identical. This greatly simplifies the solution of the heat transfer problem. If the Prandtl number and turbulent Prandtl number are different from unity, then a solution is possible by knowing the turbulent Prandtl number so that one can still solve the momentum and thermal equations.
In a general case of three-dimensional turbulence, the concept of eddy viscosity and eddy diffusivity are not valid. Consequently, the turbulent Prandtl number has no meaning.
