Fiber optic systems can be simple point-to-point data links or can involve more complex topologies.
However, it is generally necessary only to refer to point-to-point data links when discussing the process of
link design. Fiber optic systems that incorporate complex architectures can be simplified into a collection
of point-to-point data links before beginning the design process.
