With the slider in one position, the center ter-
minal is connected to the terminal at the end 
where the slider is positioned. Move the slider 
to the other position, and the center terminal 
is connected to the other end terminal. This 
type of switch is also known as an on/on switch 
because it can switch between two circuits, 
closing one while opening the other.
