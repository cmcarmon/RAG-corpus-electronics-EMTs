We also know that the ﬁnal current will be zero, since the capacitor will eventually behave
as an open-circuit, meaning that eventually no electrons will ﬂow in the circuit. Now that we
know both the starting and ﬁnal current values, we can use our universal formula to determine
the current after 7.25 seconds of switch closure in the same RC circuit:
