Another alternative is the declarative paradigm. Declarative languages such as Prolog and STRAND88 are
both functional and declarative. In the declarative paradigm, solutions are obtained as a byproduct of meeting
limitations imposed by constraints. Think of the solution to a problem as the only (ﬁrst) solution that satisﬁes
all constraints declared by the program.
