When applied to a rotating shaft, the outer drive shaft of this tachometer runs free until a starting
button is depressed to start the timing element. In figure 2-6, note the starting button beneath the index
finger. The chronometric tachometer retains readings on its dial after its drive shaft has been disengaged
from a rotating shaft and until the pointers are returned to 0 by the reset button (usually the starting
button). The range of a chronometric tachometer is usually from 0 to 10,000 rpm and from 0 to 3,000 feet
per minute (fpm).
