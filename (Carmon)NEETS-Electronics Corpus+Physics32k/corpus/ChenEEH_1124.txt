Immobile structures made by micromachining generally pro-
vide a means for guiding the motion of signals or ﬂuids.
Optical waveguides that channel photons along the surfaces
of chips are a prime example. Waveguides for transmission of
electronic signals at microwave frequencies are another. Chan-
nels in systems for the analyses of both gaseous and liquid
samples are also micromachined structures with no moving
parts. Microstructures ﬁnd applications in the communica-
tions, analytical, and medical industries. Static structures inte-
grated with electronics form the basis of infrared imagers that
are of use in the transportation industry, for civilian security,
and military operations. Because these imagers are sensors,
they will be discussed in the next subsection.
