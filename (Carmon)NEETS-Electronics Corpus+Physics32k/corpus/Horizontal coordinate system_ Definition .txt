This coordinate system divides the sky into the upper hemisphere where objects are visible, and the lower hemisphere where objects cannot be seen since the Earth obstructs vision. The great circle separating the hemispheres is called the celestial horizon. The celestial horizon is defined as the great circle on the celestial sphere whose plane is normal to the local gravity vector. In practice, the horizon can be defined as the plane tangent to a still liquid surface such as a pool of mercury. The pole of the upper hemisphere is called the zenith. The pole of the lower hemisphere is called the nadir.
There are two independent horizontal angular coordinates:
Altitude (Alt), sometimes referred to as elevation, is the angle between the object and the observer's local horizon. For visible objects it is an angle between 0 degrees and 90 degrees.
Alternatively, zenith distance may be used instead of altitude. The zenith distance is the complement of altitude, so that the sum of the altitude and the zenith distance is 90Â°

Azimuth (Az), that is the angle of the object around the horizon, usually measured from the north increasing towards the east. Exceptions are, for example, ESO's FITS convention where it is measured from the south increasing towards the west, or the FITS convention of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey where it is measured from the south increasing towards the east.
The horizontal coordinate system is sometimes also called the az/el system, the Alt/Az system, or the altazimuth system, from the name of the altazimuth mount for telescopes, whose two axes follow altitude and azimuth.
