Basic Microstrip Antenna Element
The basic microstrip antenna element is derived from a lg/2 microstrip transmission line resonator [Pozar,
1990]. It consists of a thin metallic conducting patch etched on a grounded dielectric substrate, as shown in
Fig. 38.14. This example is shown with a coaxial probe feed, but other feeds are possible, as discussed below.
