How High Is a HLL?
There have been many attempts to quantify the level of a programming language. The major obstacle has been
to ﬁnd a suitable measure of level. This is further complicated by the fact that nearly all computer languages
contain some use of abstraction, and therefore nearly all languages have a “level.” Perhaps the most interesting
approach comes from information theory.
