Occasionally, the first sky wave will return to Earth within the range of the ground wave. If the sky 
wave and ground wave are nearly of equal intensity, the sky wave alternately reinforces and cancels the 
ground wave, causing severe fading. This is caused by the phase difference between the two waves, a 
result of the longer path traveled by the sky wave.
