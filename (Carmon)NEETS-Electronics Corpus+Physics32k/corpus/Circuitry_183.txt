This  chapter  introduces  basic  alternating  current 
theory.  We  discuss 
to 
describe  alternating  waveforms  and  the  behaviour 
of  resistors,  capacitors,  and  inductors  when  an 
alternating current is applied to them. The chapter 
concludes  by 
another  useful 
component, the transformer.
