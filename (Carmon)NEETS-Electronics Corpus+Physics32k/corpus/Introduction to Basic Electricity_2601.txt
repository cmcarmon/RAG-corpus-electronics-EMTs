The power consumed by the resistor in an AC cir-
cuit varies with the amount of current flowing through 
it and the voltage applied across it. Figure 23-7 shows 
the relationship of power, current, and voltage. The 
power	curve	does not fall below the reference line 
because the power is dissipated in the form of heat. It 
does not matter in which direction the current is flow-
ing, as power is assumed to have a positive value.
