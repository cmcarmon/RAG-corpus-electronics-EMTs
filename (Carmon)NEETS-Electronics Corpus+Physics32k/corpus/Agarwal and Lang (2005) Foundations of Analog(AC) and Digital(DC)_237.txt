When designing a non-native information processing system, there are
many choices for signal representation. For example, the use of voltage versus
current, or analog versus discrete signals are two such choices. Each represen-
tation has its advantages and disadvantages, and facilitates a certain kind of
processing. For example, digital representations offer noise immunity at the
expense of precision. How these choices are made is usually application spe-
cific, and often depends on the availability of convenient transducers, power
and noise considerations, and the availability of appropriate elements. The use
of voltage to represent signals is probably most common, and is used routinely
here. However, we will also encounter situations in which the signal repre-
sentation switches from a voltage to a current and back again as the signal is
processed.
