In this chapter, we provided an overview of discrete-time and
continuous-time signals and systems. The emphasis was on
discrete time, but notions for the two cases were presented in
parallel. Fundamentals of discrete-time systems and properties
such as linearity, time-invariance, causality, and stability were
presented. Fourier analysis of signals was presented followed
by a discussion of frequency-selective ﬁltering. Basics of z-
transforms were covered next along with a discussion of the
z-domain interpretation of system properties, such as causality
and stability. The operations of sampling and quantization that
relate continuous and discrete time signals were brieﬂy dis-
cussed. Finally, the discrete Fourier transform was presented
and its importance in implementing signal processing algo-
rithms described. Our discussion was largely conﬁned to the
description and processing of deterministic signals. A discus-
sion of issues in implementation and the use and design of
digital signal processors (Lapsley et al., 1997) is not within the
scope of this chapter.
