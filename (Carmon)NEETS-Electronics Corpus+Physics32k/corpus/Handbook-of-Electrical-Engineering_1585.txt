, and information over a multiple of periods was used to compute the Fourier coefﬁcients and/or
to smooth the periodogram, since depending on the starting time, the periodogram may contain irregular and
spurious peaks. A notable exception to periodogram was the linear regression analysis introduced by the British
statistician Yule [Yule, 1927] to obtain a more accurate description of the periodicities in noisy data. Because
