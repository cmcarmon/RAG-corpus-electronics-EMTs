To design effective FD and FT techniques, it is necessary to
encapsulate the primary effects of such faults in a manageable
and general fault model that accounts for the behavior for
most, if not all, fault types. Mechanisms to tackle faults can
then be designed in a general and effective way by addressing
the fault model rather than the very large number of faults
underlying that model (Hayes, 1985; Johnson, 1989). Two
classical fault models that have proven reasonably effective
are the logical stuck-at-fault model used at the logic circuit
level and the transistor stuck-at-fault model used at the tran-
sistor circuit level.
