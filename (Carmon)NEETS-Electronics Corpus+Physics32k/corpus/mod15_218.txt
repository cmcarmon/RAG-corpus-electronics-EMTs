Blown fuse indicators are front panel lights which light when a protective fuse in series with the 
rotor blows. Figure 1-45 shows a typical blown fuse indicator. If excessive current flows in the rotor 
windings of this circuit because of a short or severe mechanical overload, one of the fuses will blow and 
the neon lamp across the fuse will light.
