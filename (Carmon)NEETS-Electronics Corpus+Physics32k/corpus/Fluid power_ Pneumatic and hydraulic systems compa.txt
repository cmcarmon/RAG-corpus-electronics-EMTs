Cost: Pneumatics are less expensive to build and operate. Air is used as the compressed medium, so there is no requirement to drain or recover fluid. Hydraulic systems use larger working pressures, and require larger parts than pneumatics.
Precision: Unlike liquids, gases change volume significantly when pressurized making it difficult to achieve precision.
