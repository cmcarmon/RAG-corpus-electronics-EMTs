Dia- and Paramagnetism
The phenomenon of magnetism arises ultimately from moving electrical charges (electrons). The movement may
be orbital around the nucleus or the other degree of freedom possessed by electrons which, by analogy with the
motion of the planets, is referred to as spin. In technologically important materials, i.e., ferromagnetics and ferri-
magnetics, spin is more important than orbital motion. Each arrow in Fig. 36.3 represents the total spin of an atom.
An  atom  may  have  a  permanent  magnetic  moment,  in  which  case  it  is  referred  to  as  belonging  to  a
paramagnetic material, or the atom may be magnetized only when in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld, in which
case it is called diamagnetic. Diamagnetics are magnetized in the opposite direction to that of the applied magnetic
ﬁeld,  i.e.,  they  display  negative  susceptibility  (a  measure  of  the  induced  magnetization  per  unit  of  applied
magnetic  ﬁeld).  Paramagnetics  are  magnetized  in  the  same  direction  as  the  applied  magnetic  ﬁeld,  i.e.,  they
