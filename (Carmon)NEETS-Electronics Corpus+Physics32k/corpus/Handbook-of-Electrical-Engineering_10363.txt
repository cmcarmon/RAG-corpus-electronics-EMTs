This project is being constructed in three phases. Phase I included the 1995 construction of two Boeing-
built  nodes  (Node  1  and  Node 2).  The  nodes  will  serve  as  connecting  passageways  between  modules.
Phase I was completed in early 1996 with the production of the U.S. laboratory module where astronauts
will perform continuous scientiÔ¨Åc research.
