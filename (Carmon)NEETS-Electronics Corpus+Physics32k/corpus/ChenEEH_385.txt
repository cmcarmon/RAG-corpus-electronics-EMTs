as required by equation 4.6. This simple process is valid pro-
vided that the individual sections do not interact. Speciﬁcally,
section Tiþ1 must not load section Ti. In active ﬁlters, this is
generally not a problem because the output of a ﬁlter section is
taken from an op-amp output. The output impedance of an
op-amp is low, ideally zero, and therefore can drive the next
stage in the cascade conﬁguration without loading effects. A
major advantage of cascade design is that transfer functions
with zeros anywhere in the s-plane can be obtained. Thus,
arbitrary transfer functions can be implemented. Ladder simu-
lations have somewhat lower passband sensitivities to com-
ponent tolerances, but their transmission zeros are restricted to
the jv axis.
