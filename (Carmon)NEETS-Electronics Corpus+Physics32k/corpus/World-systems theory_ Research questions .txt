World-systems theory asks several key questions:
How is the world system affected by changes in its components (e.g. nations, ethnic groups, social classes, etc.)?
How does it affect its components?
To what degree, if any, does the core need the periphery to be underdeveloped?
What causes world systems to change?
What system may replace capitalism?
Some questions are more specific to certain subfields; for example, Marxists would concern themselves whether world-systems theory is a useful or unhelpful development of Marxist theories.
