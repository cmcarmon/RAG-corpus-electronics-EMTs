The obvious disadvantage of LPM is its lack of direct overwrite capability. A more subtle concern is that it
is perhaps unsuitable for the PWM (pulse width modulation) scheme of representing binary waveforms. Due
to ﬂuctuations in the laser power, spatial variations of material properties, lack of perfect focusing and track
following, etc., the length of a recorded domain along the track may ﬂuctuate in small but unpredictable ways.
If the information is to be encoded in the distance between adjacent domain walls (i.e., PWM), then the LPM
scheme of thermomagnetic writing may suffer from excessive domain-wall jitter. Laser power modulation works
well, however, when the information is encoded in the position of domain centers (i.e., pulse position modu-
lation or PPM). In general, PWM is superior to PPM in terms of the recording density, and, therefore, recording
techniques that allow PWM are preferred.
