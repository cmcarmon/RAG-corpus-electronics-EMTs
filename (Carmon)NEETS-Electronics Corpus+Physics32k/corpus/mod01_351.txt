This paste, which is packed in the space between the anode and the blotting paper, also serves to 
hold the anode rigid in the center of the cell. When the paste is packed in the cell, a small space is left at 
the top for expansion of the electrolytic paste caused by the depolarization action. The cell is then sealed 
with a cardboard or plastic seal.
