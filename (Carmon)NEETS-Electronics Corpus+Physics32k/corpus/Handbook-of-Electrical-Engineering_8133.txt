The interfacing requirements, which are otherwise similar in multiplexing techniques, etc., are complicated
by  the  requirement  for  zero  net  dc  bias  across  the  cell  in  order  to  avoid  electrochemical  degradation  of  the
material. LCDs require ac drive signals, and square waves of frequency between 25 Hz and 1 kHz are typically
used [Wilson and Hawkes, 1989]. A square wave is applied to the backplane, with in-phase and antiphase signals
to the counter electrode determining whether the given pixel or segment is on or off. In practice, the state is
determined by the root-mean-square (rms) value of the differential voltage applied.
