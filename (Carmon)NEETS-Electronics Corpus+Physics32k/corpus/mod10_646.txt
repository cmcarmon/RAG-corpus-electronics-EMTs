The radiation pattern in figure 4-12 is obtained by using the same procedure that was used for (figure 
4-10, view B). The radiation measured at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 is 0. Position 5 measures approximately 
1 unit. This is marked on the graph and the rotating radius moves to position 6. At this position a reading 
of 5.5 units is taken. As before, this point is marked on the graph. The procedure is repeated around the 
circle and a reading is obtained from positions 6 through 11. At position 12 no radiation is indicated, and 
this continues on to position 16.
