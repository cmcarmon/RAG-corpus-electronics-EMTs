Using the above procedure, we compute and update fuzzy time
stamps p(t), fuzzy enabling times e(t), and fuzzy occurrence
times o(t) each time a transition ﬁring (atomic action) occurs,
starting from the initial (given) fuzzy time stamps of tokens
in the initial marking M0 and initially speciﬁed fuzzy delays.
