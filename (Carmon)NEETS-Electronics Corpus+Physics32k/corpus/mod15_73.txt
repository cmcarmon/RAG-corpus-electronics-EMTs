The torque developed in a synchro receiver results from the tendency of two electromagnets to align 
themselves. Since the rotor can be turned and the stator usually cannot, the stator must exert a force 
(torque) tending to pull the rotor into a position where the primary and secondary magnetic fields are in 
line. The strength of the magnetic field produced by the stator determines the torque. The field strength 
depends on the current through the stator coils. As the current through the stator is increased, the field 
strength increases and more torque is developed.
