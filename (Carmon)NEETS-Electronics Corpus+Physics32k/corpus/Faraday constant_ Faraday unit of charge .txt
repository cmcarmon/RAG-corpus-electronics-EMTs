Related to Faraday's constant is the "faraday", a unit of electrical charge. It is much less common than the coulomb, but sometimes used in electrochemistry. One faraday of charge is the magnitude of the charge of one mole of electrons, i.e. 96485.33289(59) C.
Expressed in faradays, the Faraday constant F equals "1 faraday of charge per mole".
This faraday unit is not to be confused with the farad, an unrelated unit of capacitance (1 farad = 1 coulomb / 1 volt).
