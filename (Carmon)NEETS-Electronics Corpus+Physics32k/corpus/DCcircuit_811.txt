Given standard resistances of sufﬁcient precision and a null detector device of sufﬁcient
sensitivity, resistance measurement accuracies of at least +/- 0.05% are attainable with a
Wheatstone bridge. It is the preferred method of resistance measurement in calibration labo-
ratories due to its high accuracy.
