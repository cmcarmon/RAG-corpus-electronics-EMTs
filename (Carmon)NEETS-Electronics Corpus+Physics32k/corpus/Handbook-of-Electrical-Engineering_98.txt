Large-value capacitors are often used to ﬁlter dc power supplies. After a capacitor is charged, the rectiﬁer
stops conducting and the capacitor discharges into the load, as shown in Fig. 1.17, until the next cycle. Then
the capacitor recharges again to the peak voltage. The De is equal to the total peak-to-peak ripple voltage and
is  a  complex  wave  containing  many  harmonics  of  the  fundamental  ripple  frequency,  causing  the  noticeable
heating of the capacitor.
