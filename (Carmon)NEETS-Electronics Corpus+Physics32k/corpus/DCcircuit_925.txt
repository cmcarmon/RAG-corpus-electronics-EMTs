the resistance of the top wire (Rwire1) has been ”bypassed” now that the voltmeter connects
directly to the top terminal of the strain gauge, leaving only the lower wire’s resistance (Rwire2)
to contribute any stray resistance in series with the gauge. Not a perfect solution, of course,
but twice as good as the last circuit!
