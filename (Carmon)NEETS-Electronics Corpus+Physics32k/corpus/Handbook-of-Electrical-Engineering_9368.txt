2. Electromagnetic design and simulation. Software in this area might simulate a printed-circuit board for
a 32-bit-wide, 8-bit-byte reversal network. Multilayers of a board are displayed, with colors indicating
current densities in lines. Representative systems are Hewlett-Packard’s High Frequency Structure Sim-
ulator (HFSS), a ﬁnite-element-based product having animation of ﬁeld plots and conductor loss and
3-D  full-wave  solution  and  S-parameter  output;  Sonnet  Software’s  “em”  package  with  animation  of
conductor  currents;  and  Compact  Software’s  Microwave  Explorer  with  X-Windows  and  OSF  Motif
graphical interfaces.
