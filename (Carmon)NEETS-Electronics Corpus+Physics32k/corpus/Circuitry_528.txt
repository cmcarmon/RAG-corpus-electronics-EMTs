Arithmetic logic unit (ALU) 
 
As its name suggests, the ALU performs arithmetic 
and logic operations. The ALU has two inputs (in 
this case these are both 8-bits wide). One of these 
inputs  is  derived  from  the  Accumulator  whilst  the 
other  is  taken  from  the  internal  data  bus  via  a 
temporary  register  (not  shown  in  Fig.  11.3).  The 
operations  provided  by  the  ALU  usually  include 
addition,  subtraction,  logical  AND,  logical  OR, 
logical exclusive-OR, shift left, shift right, etc. The 
result  of  most  ALU  operations  appears  in  the 
accumulator.
