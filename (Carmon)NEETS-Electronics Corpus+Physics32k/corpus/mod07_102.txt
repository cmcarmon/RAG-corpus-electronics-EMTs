The pure semiconductor mentioned earlier is basically neutral. It contains no free electrons in its
conduction bands. Even with the application of thermal energy, only a few covalent bonds are broken,
yielding a relatively small current flow. A much more efficient method of increasing current flow in
semiconductors is by adding very small amounts of selected additives to them, generally no more than a
few parts per million. These additives are called impurities and the process of adding them to crystals is
referred to as DOPING. The purpose of semiconductor doping is to increase the number of free charges
that can be moved by an external applied voltage. When an impurity increases the number of free
electrons, the doped semiconductor is NEGATIVE or N TYPE, and the impurity that is added is known
as an N-type impurity. However, an impurity that reduces the number of free electrons, causing more
