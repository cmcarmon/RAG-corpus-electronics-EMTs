To inject an input signal to the base, causing VBE and IB to
ﬂuctuate  by  vbe  and  ib ,  a  signal  source  must  be  connected
between  the  base  and  the  common  or  zero  line  (also  usually
called  ground  or  earth  whether  it  is  actually  connected  to
ground or not!). However, most signal sources present a resis-
tive  path  through  themselves,  which  would  shunt  R2  and  so
change, or even destroy, the bias conditions. Hence, a coupling
capacitor Cc must be included, as shown in Fig. 24.29, in series
with a signal source represented by a Thévenin equivalent.
