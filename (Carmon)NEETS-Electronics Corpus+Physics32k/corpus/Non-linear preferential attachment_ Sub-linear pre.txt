In this case the new nodes still tend to connect to the nodes with higher degree but this effect is smaller than in the case of linear preferential attachment. There are less hubs and their size is also smaller than in a scale-free network. The size of the largest component logarithmically depends on the number of nodes:

{\displaystyle k_{\max }\sim (\log n)^{1/(1-\alpha )}}

so it is smaller than the polynomial dependence.
