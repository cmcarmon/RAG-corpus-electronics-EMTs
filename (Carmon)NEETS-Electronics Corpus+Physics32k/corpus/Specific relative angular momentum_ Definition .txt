The specific relative angular momentum is defined as the cross product of the relative position vector






r

{\displaystyle {\vec {r}}}
and the relative velocity vector






v
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {v}}}
.

{\displaystyle {\vec {h}}={\vec {r}}\times {\vec {v}}={\frac {\vec {L}}{m}}}

The






h
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {h}}}
vector is always perpendicular to the instantaneous osculating orbital plane, which coincides with the instantaneous perturbed orbit. It would not necessarily be perpendicular to an average plane which accounted for many years of perturbations.
As usual in physics, the magnitude of the vector quantity






h
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {h}}}
is denoted by



h


{\displaystyle h}

{\displaystyle h=\left\|{\vec {h}}\right\|}
