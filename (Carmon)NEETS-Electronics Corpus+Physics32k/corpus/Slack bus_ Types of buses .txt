Buses are of 3 types and are classified as:
PQ bus – the real power |P| and reactive power |Q| are specified. It is also known as Load Bus. Generally, in a PQ bus, the generated real and reactive power will be assumed to be zero. However, power will be flowing out, thus, the real power and reactive power will be both negative. The Load Bus will be used to find the bus voltage and angle.
PV bus – the real power |P| and the voltage magnitude |V| are specified. It is also known as Generator Bus. The real power and voltage are specified for buses that are generators. These buses have a constant power generation, controlled through a prime mover, and a constant bus voltage.
Slack bus – to balance the active and reactive power in the system. It is also known as the Reference Bus or the Swing Bus. The slack bus will serve as an angular reference for all other buses in the system, which is set to 0°. The voltage magnitude is also assumed to be 1 p.u. at the slack bus.
The slack bus provides or absorbs active and reactive power to and from the transmission line to provide for losses, since these variables are unknown until the final solution is established. The slack bus is the only bus for which the system reference phase angle is defined. From this, the various angular differences can be calculated in the power flow equations. If a slack bus is not specified, then a generator bus with maximum real power |P| acts as the slack bus. A given scheme can involve more than one slack bus.
