The SkyHawks are the Canadian Forces Parachute Demonstration Team. Based at CFB Trenton in Trenton, Ontario, they are a sub-unit of the Canadian Army Advanced Warfare Centre (CAAWC).
The team consists of both permanent members and temporary members from the Regular and Reserve Forces. They act as ambassadors for the Canadian Forces at special events, airshows and events. They are easily recognizable because their parachutes resemble the Canadian flag.
