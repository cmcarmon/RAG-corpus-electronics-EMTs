Solution:
There  are  two  ways  we  can  solve  this  problem.  One  way  is  to  obtain
the  equivalent  resistance  at  the  inductor  terminals  and  then  use
Eq. (7.20). The other way is to start from scratch by using Kirchhoff’s
voltage  law.  Whichever  approach  is  taken,  it  is  always  better  to  ﬁrst
obtain the inductor current.
