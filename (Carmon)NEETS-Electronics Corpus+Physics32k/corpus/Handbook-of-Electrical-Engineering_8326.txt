3. Testing of the RAM block itself is difﬁcult since controlling its inputs and observing its outputs require
manipulating  the  upstream  and  downstream  logic  circuit  blocks,  which  may  be  difﬁcult  to  achieve.
Solution to this problem involves providing adequate control of the RAM block inputs (data, address,
and read/write control) as well as providing observability of the RAM outputs. In effect, the embedded
RAM block can be made testable as if it was a stand-alone block where established memory test algorithms
can be applied [Breuer and Friedman, 1976].
