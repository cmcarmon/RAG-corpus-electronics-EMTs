Node Equations
Suppose a network N has no independent voltage sources. A
convenient description of N with the node voltages as inde-
pendent variables can be obtained as follows.
Let A be the incidence matrix of N with vertex vr as refer-
ence. Let A be partitioned as A Â¼ [A11, A12], where the
columns of A11 and A12 correspond, respectively, to the RLC
elements and current sources. If I1 and I2 denote the column
vectors of RLC element currents and current source currents,
then KCL equations for N become:
