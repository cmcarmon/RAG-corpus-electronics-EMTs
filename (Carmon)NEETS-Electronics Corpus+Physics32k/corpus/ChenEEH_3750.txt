The ‘‘Hidden’’ and Observable Random Processes Associated
with an HMM
A diagram of a typical HMM with six states is shown in Figure
3.11. The states are labeled by integers. The structure, or
topology, of the HMM is determined by its allowable state
transitions, and speech-related HMMs almost always have a
left-to-right or Bakis (Bakis, 1976) topology in keeping with
the natural temporal ordering of events in an utterance. Two
slightly different forms of the HMM are used. The one usually
(but not always) discussed for acoustic processing (modeling
the signal, as we are doing here) emits an observation upon
arrival at each successive state. (It also emits one from the
initial state at the outset.) The alternative form, generally
employed in language processing, emits an observation during
the transition. The state emitter form of the model is called
a Moore machine in automata theory, while the transition
emitter form is a Mealy machine (Hopcroft and Ullman,
1979). Throughout the rest of this discussion, we will discuss
the Moore form. The differences in algorithms associated
with the two forms are largely a matter of interpretations of
quantities.
