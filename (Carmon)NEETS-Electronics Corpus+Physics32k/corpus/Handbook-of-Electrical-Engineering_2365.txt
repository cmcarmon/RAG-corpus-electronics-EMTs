Equations  to  Be  Solved.
In  this  approach,  the  potential  distribution  inside  the  device  is  calculated  using
Poissonâ€™s equation. This potential distribution is then used in the SWE to yield the electron wave vector, which
in turn is used to calculate the carrier distribution, using the following expression:
