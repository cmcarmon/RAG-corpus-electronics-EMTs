In a monopolar metallic return system, shown in Fig. 61.9, return current ï¬‚ows through a conductor, thus
avoiding problems associated with ground return current. This method is generally used as a contingency mode
of operation for a normal bipolar transmission system in the event of a partial converter (one-pole equipment)
outage. In the case of outage of a one-pole converter, the conductor of the affected pole will be used as the
returning conductor. A metallic return transfer breaker will be opened, diverting the return current from the
ground path and into the pole conductor. This conductor will be grounded at one end and will be insulated
at the other end. This system can transmit half the power of the normal bipolar system capacity (and can be
increased if overload capacity is available). However, the line losses will be doubled compared to the normal
bipolar operation for the same power transmitted.
