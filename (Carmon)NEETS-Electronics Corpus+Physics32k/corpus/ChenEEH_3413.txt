Current Transformer
Current transformers (CTs) are used to reduce the current
levels from thousands of amperes down to a standard output
of either 5 A or 1 A for normal operation. During faults, the
current levels at the transformer terminals can go up several
orders of magnitude. Most of the current transformers in use
today are simple magnetically coupled iron-core transformers.
They are input/output devices operating with a hysteresis of
the magnetic circuit and, as such, are prone to saturation. The
selection of instrument transformers is critical for ensuring a
correct protective relaying operation. They need to be sized
appropriately to prevent saturation. If there is no saturation,
instrument transformers will operate in a linear region, and
their basic function may be represented via a simple turns
ratio. Even though this is an ideal situation, it can be assumed
to be true for computing simple relaying interfacing require-
ments. If a remanent magnetism is present in an instrument
transformer core, then the hysteresis may affect the time
needed to saturate next time the transformer gets exposed
to excessive fault signals. The current transformers come as
free-standing solutions or as a part of the circuit breaker
or power transformer design. If they come preinstalled with
the power system apparatus, they are located in the bushings of
that piece of equipment.
