The use of genetic engineering to create organisms specifically designed for bioremediation has great potential. Two category of genes can be inserted in the organism: degradative genes which encode proteins required for the degradation of pollutants, and reporter genes that are able to monitor pollutant levels. An example of a degradation gene is biphenyl dioxygenase, which has been transformed in E.Coli to degrade PCB (polychlorinated biphenyl). An example of a reporter gene is lux, which can act as a biosensor for detecting the Hg2+ concentration in E.Coli. Numerous members of Pseudomonas have also been modified with the lux gene, but for the detection of the polyaromatic hydrocarbon naphthalene. A field test for the release of the modified organism has been successful on a moderately large scale.
There are concerns surrounding release and containment of genetically modified organisms into the environment due to the potential of horizontal gene transfer. Genetically modified organisms are classified and controlled under the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 under United States Environmental Protection Agency. Measures have been created to address these concerns. Organisms can be modified such that they can only survive and grow under specific sets of environmental conditions. Outside of environmental conditions they were designed for, they lose their biodegradation ability or undergo self destruction. To survive, a signal (the pollutant) is required. In the absence of the signal, a suicide gene is expressed which will lead to cell apoptosis. In addition, the tracking of modified organisms can be made easier with the insertion of bioluminescence genes for visual identification.
