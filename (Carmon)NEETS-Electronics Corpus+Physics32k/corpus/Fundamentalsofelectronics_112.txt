As the resistance approaches inﬁnity, we have what is known as an open circuit: No current ﬂows but a
non-zero voltage can appear across the open circuit. As the resistance becomes zero, the voltage goes to zero
for a non-zero current ﬂow. This situation corresponds to a short circuit. A superconductor physically
realizes a short circuit.
