The quantitative measure of the type of a chemical bond is
ionicity, fi. The ionicity is zero for a purely covalent bond and
unity for a purely heteropolar bond. The ionicity values
0 < fi < 1 can be assigned to any binary chemical compound.
Elemental semiconductors, such as Si, Ge, or diamond, have
zero ionicity. According to the ionicity scale proposed by
fi ¼ 0:177 for silicon carbide (SiC) and
Phillips in 1973,
fi ¼ 0:31 for GaAs.
