Note  that  l is  the  electrical  length  of  the  aerial 
rather than its actual physical length. End effects, 
or  capacitance  effects  at  the  ends  of  the  aerial, 
require that we reduce the actual length of the aerial 
and  a  5%  reduction  in  length  is  typically  required 
for  an  aerial  to  be  resonant  at  the  centre  of  its 
designed tuning range.
