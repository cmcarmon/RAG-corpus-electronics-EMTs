In order to achieve high quality input data, algorithms have been developed to estimate the state of a system
based  on  the  available  on-line  data  (state  estimation).  These  methods  are  based  on  weighted  least  squares
techniques to ﬁnd the best state vector to ﬁt the scatter of data. This becomes a major problem when conﬂicting
information is received. However, as more data becomes available, the reliability of the estimate can be improved.
