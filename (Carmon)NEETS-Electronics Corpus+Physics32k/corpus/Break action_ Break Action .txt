A substantial hinge pin joins the two parts of the rifle or shotgun; the stock with its firing mechanism and the fore-piece and barrel, which hold the round to be fired. In some cases the hinging pin may be easily removable, allowing the two portions of the weapon to be compactly and safely stored. In other cases the hinge will consist of a hook over a pin; releasing an auxiliary latch will allow sufficient travel to allow the hinge to be unhooked.
A latch is operated to release the two parts of the weapon, allowing the breech to be exposed. A shell is inserted into the breech (up to two for a double barreled shotgun and six to eight for a revolver), and the mechanism is closed and latched. The hammer is then pulled back and latched. The weapon can now ready be fired, done by squeezing the trigger.
After firing the rounds, the break action is unlatched and the barrel and forearm are allowed to fall forward. This causes an extractor catch to remove the spent shell, which then falls to the ground. The weapon is now ready for a new cycle.
