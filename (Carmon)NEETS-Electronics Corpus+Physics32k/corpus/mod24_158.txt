As their name implies, multimode fibers propagate more than one mode. Multimode fibers can
propagate over 100 modes. The number of modes propagated depends on the core size and numerical
aperture (NA). As the core size and NA increase, the number of modes increases. Typical values of fiber
core size and NA are 50 to 100 ï¿½m and 0.20 to 0.29, respectively.
