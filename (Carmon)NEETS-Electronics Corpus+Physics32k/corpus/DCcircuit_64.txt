As was previously mentioned, we need more than just a continuous path (circuit) before a con-
tinuous ﬂow of electrons will occur: we also need some means to push these electrons around
the circuit. Just like marbles in a tube or water in a pipe, it takes some kind of inﬂuencing
force to initiate ﬂow. With electrons, this force is the same force at work in static electricity:
the force produced by an imbalance of electric charge.
