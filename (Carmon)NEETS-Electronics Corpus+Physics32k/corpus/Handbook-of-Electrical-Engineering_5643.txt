Before transmission planning is started, long-term load forecasting and generation planning are completed.
In long-term load forecasting, peak and off-peak loads in each area of the system under study are projected,
year by year, from the present up to 25 years into the future. Such forecasts are based on present and past load
trends, population growth patterns, and economic indicators. In generation planning, generation resources are
selected with sufÔ¨Åcient generation reserve margins to meet projected customer loads with adequate quality and
reliability  in  an  economic  manner.  New  generating  units  both  at  new  plant  sites  and  at  existing  plants  are
selected, and construction schedules are established to ensure that new generation goes on-line in time to meet
projected loads.
