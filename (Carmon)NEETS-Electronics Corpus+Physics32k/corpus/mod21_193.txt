â€¢ VERY SENSITIVE DEVICES. These include MOS and CMOS devices without input diode
protection circuitry on all input circuits; dielectrically isolated semiconductors with internal
capacitor contacts connected to external pins; and microcircuits using N + guard-ring
construction (with metalization crossing over the guard ring).
