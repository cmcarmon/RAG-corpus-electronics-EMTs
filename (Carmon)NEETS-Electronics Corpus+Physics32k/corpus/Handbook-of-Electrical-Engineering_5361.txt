Cu-Ternaries and Multinaries
Interest in Cu-ternary semiconductors began in the early 1970s for solar cells. CuInSe2 and CuInS2 (and their
various alloys) have dominated R&D. Advantageous properties include: (1) suitable bandgaps for homojunc-
tions or heterojunctions; (2) direct bandgap transitions minimizing requirements for absorber-layer thickness;
(3) n- and p-type semiconductor types achievable; (4) lattice and electron afﬁnity matches with window layer
partners; (5) high optical absorption coefﬁcients; and (6) stable electro-optical properties.
