FIGURE 113.12 Genesis of the ECG. The SA node is the pacemaker, setting the rate. Excitation is propagated from the
atria to the AV node, then to the bundle of His, and to the ventricular muscle via the Purkinje Ô¨Åbers. The SA node has a
decreasing membrane potential that reaches the threshold potential (TP), resulting in spontaneous excitation (inset).
