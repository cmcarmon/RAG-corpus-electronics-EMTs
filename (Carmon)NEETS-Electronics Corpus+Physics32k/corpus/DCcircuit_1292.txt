Centuries ago, it was discovered that certain types of mineral rock possessed unusual prop-
erties of attraction to the metal iron. One particular mineral, called lodestone, or magnetite,
is found mentioned in very old historical records (about 2500 years ago in Europe, and much
earlier in the Far East) as a subject of curiosity. Later, it was employed in the aid of navigation,
as it was found that a piece of this unusual rock would tend to orient itself in a north-south
direction if left free to rotate (suspended on a string or on a ﬂoat in water). A scientiﬁc study
undertaken in 1269 by Peter Peregrinus revealed that steel could be similarly ”charged” with
this unusual property after being rubbed against one of the ”poles” of a piece of lodestone.
