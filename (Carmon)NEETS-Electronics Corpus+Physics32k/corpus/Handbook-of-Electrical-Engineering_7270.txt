The 18- to 19-GHz Radio Band: An Ideal Choice for Wireless In-Building 
Microcellular Networks
A  region  of  the  electromagnetic  spectrum  above  the  kilohertz  and  megahertz  radio  bands,  yet  below  the
extremely high frequencies of the infrared band, offers two very compelling advantages. Speciﬁcally, the 18- to
19-GHz portion of this band fulﬁlls the key requirements of spectrum reuse and bandwidth availability that
eliminates most other frequencies from consideration.
