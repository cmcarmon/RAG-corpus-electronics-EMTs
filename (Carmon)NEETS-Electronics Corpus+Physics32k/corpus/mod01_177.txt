An analogy of this action is shown in the two water tanks connected by a pipe and valve in figure
1-19. At first the valve is closed and all the water is in tank A. Thus, the water pressure across the valve is
at maximum. When the valve is opened, the water flows through the pipe from A to B until the water level
becomes the same in both tanks. The water then stops flowing in the pipe, because there is no longer a
difference in water pressure between the two tanks.
