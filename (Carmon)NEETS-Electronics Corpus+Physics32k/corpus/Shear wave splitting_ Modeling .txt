In an isotropic homogeneous medium, the shear wave function can be written as

where A is the complex amplitude,



w

(
ω
)



{\displaystyle w\left(\omega \right)}
is the wavelet function (the result of the Fourier transformed source time function), and






p
^





{\displaystyle {\hat {p}}}
is a real unit vector pointing in the displacement direction and contained in the plane orthogonal to the propagation direction.
The process of shear wave splitting can be represented as the application of the splitting operator to the shear wave function.

where






f
^





{\displaystyle {\hat {f}}}
and






s
^





{\displaystyle {\hat {s}}}
are eigenvectors of the polarization matrix with eigenvalues corresponding to the two shear wave velocities.
The resulting split waveform is

Where



δ
t


{\displaystyle \delta t}
is the time delay between the slow and fast shear waves and



ϕ


{\displaystyle \phi }
is the angle between the polarizations of the slow and fast shear waves. These two parameters can be individually estimated from multiple component seismic recordings (Fig. 5).
