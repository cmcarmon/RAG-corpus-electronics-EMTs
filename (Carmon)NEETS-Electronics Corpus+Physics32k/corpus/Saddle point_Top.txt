In mathematics, a saddle point or minimax point is a point on the surface of the graph of a function where the slopes (derivatives) of orthogonal function components defining the surface become zero (a stationary point) but are not a local extremum on both axes. An example of a saddle point shown on the right is when we have a critical point with a relative minimum along one axial direction (between peaks) and at a relative maximum along the crossing axis. However, a saddle point need not be in this form. For example, the function



f
(
x
,
y
)
=

x

2


+

y

3




{\displaystyle f(x,y)=x^{2}+y^{3}}
has a critical point at



(
0
,
0
)


{\displaystyle (0,0)}
that is a saddle point since it is neither a relative maximum nor relative minimum, but it does not have a relative maximum or relative minimum in the



y


{\displaystyle y}
-direction.
The name derives from the fact that the prototypical example in two dimensions is a surface that curves up in one direction, and curves down in a different direction, resembling a riding saddle or a mountain pass between two peaks forming a landform saddle. In terms of contour lines, a saddle point in two dimensions gives rise to a contour graph or trace that appears to intersect itselfâ€”such conceptually might form a 'figure eight' around both peaks; assuming the contour graph is at the very 'specific altitude' of the saddle point in three dimensions.
