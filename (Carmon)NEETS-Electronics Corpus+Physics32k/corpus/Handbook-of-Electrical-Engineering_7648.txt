will switch to point B [Fig. 79.28(c)]. At this point the electrical impedance is low and light is emitted. When
the input light is removed, the operating point returns via the origin to point A by momentarily setting the
electrical supply to zero [Fig. 79.28(d)]. These devices can be used as either optical OR or AND gates using a
bias beam and several other optical inputs.
