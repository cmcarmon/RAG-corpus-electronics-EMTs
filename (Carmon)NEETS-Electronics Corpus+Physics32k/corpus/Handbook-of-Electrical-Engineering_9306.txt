Efﬁciency. The costs of running a computer program are determined (1) by the time needed to compute the
desired result and (2) by the amount of storage space the program requires to run. As the costs of computer
hardware have declined dramatically over the past decade, the importance of program efﬁciency has similarly
declined. Yet,  there  are  different  dimensions  to  efﬁciency.  Choosing  the  right  algorithm  is  still  crucial,  while
local optimization should not be pursued, if it increases the complexity and decreases the clarity of a program
and thereby jeopardizes its correctness and maintainability.
