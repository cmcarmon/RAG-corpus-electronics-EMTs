Only a couple of dozen types of lasers have proved to be commercially viable on any signiÔ¨Åcant scale; these
are summarized in Table 31.1. Some of these types, notably the ruby and helium-neon lasers, have been around
since the beginning of the laser era. Others, such as vibronic solid-state, are promising newcomers. The family
of commercial lasers is expanding slowly, as new types such as titanium-sapphire come on the market, but with
the economics of production a factor to be considered, the number of commercially viable lasers will always
be limited.
