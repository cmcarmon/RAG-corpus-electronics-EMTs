The arc fault circuit interrupter (AFCI), a circuit breaker designed to prevent ﬁres, is de-
signed to open on intermittent resistive short circuits. For example, a normal 15 A breaker
is designed to open circuit quickly if loaded well beyond the 15 A rating, more slowly a little
beyond the rating. While this protects against direct shorts and several seconds of overload,
respectively, it does not protect against arcs– similar to arc-welding. An arc is a highly variable
load, repetitively peaking at over 70 A, open circuiting with alternating current zero-crossings.
Though, the average current is not enough to trip a standard breaker, it is enough to start a
ﬁre. This arc could be created by a metalic short circuit which burns the metal open, leaving a
resistive sputtering plasma of ionized gases.
