Overall, FDTD and related techniques are marching-in-time
procedures that simulate the continuous actual electromag-
netic waves in a ﬁnite spatial region by sampled-data numer-
ical analogs propagating in a computer data space. Time-
stepping continues as the numerical wave analogs propagate
in the space lattice to causally connect the physics of the
modeled region. For simulations where the modeled region
must extend to inﬁnity, absorbing boundary conditions
(ABCs) are employed at the outer lattice truncation planes,
which ideally permit, all outgoing wave analogs to exit the
region with negligible reﬂection. Phenomena such as induc-
tion of surface currents, scattering and multiple scattering,
aperture penetration, and cavity excitation are modeled time-
step by time-step by the action of the numerical analog to the
curl equations. Self-consistency of these modeled phenomena
is generally ensured if their spatial and temporal variations are
well resolved by the space and time sampling process. In fact,
the goal is to provide a self-consistent model of the mutual
coupling of all of the electrically small volume cells constitut-
ing the structure and its near ﬁeld, even if the structure spans
tens of wavelengths in three dimensions and there are hun-
dreds of millions of space cells.
