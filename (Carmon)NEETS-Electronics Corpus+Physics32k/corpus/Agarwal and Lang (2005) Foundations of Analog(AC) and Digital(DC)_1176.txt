mon emitter BJT amplifier shown in Figure 7.54, which is redrawn here in Figure 8.43
to show that the total input vIN is the sum of a DC offset voltage VIN and a small-signal
voltage vin. In keeping with our usual small-signal notation, the total, operating point,
and small-signal voltages at the output are given by vO, VO, and vo respectively. We will
compute the small-signal gain of the amplifier assuming that the amplifier operates in its
active region, and given that RI = 100 k, RL = 10 k, and VS = 10 V. Assume that
the current gain parameter Î² for the BJT is 100, and that the input operating voltage is
chosen to be VIN = 1 V.
We now begin the small-signal analysis of our BJT amplifier. The first step of small-signal
analysis is to determine the operating-point variables in the circuit. Although not strictly
