Timing  analysis  can  be  performed  dynamically  or  statically.  Dynamic  timing  analysis  exercises  the  design
via simulation or emulation for a period of time with a set of input stimuli and records the timing behavior.
Static timing analysis does not exercise the design via simulation or emulation. Rather, static analysis records
timing  behavior  based  on  the  timing  behavior,  e.g.,  propagation  delay,  of  the  design  components  and  their
interconnection.
