Second-Generation Systems
The  recent  wave  of  satellites  have  much  higher  power  than  their  predecessors.  The  Intelsat K  satellite,  for
example,  is  equipped  with  60-W  TWTAs  and  serves  increasing  worldwide  trafﬁc,  video,  and VSAT  services.
Another  example  is  the  Telstar  4  satellite  which  has  variable  power  up  to  120 W  for  Ku-band  transmissions
and is being promoted to be HDTV compatible in preparation for expected widespread use of HDTV. Other
trends in satellite design, i.e., NASA’s advanced communication technology satellite (ACTS), include the use of
multiple spot beams and onboard IF and/or baseband switching. Onboard switching coupled with electronically
hopped spot beams and laser intersatellite links have been proposed. Spot beams provide higher satellite EIRP
which permits small, low-cost VSATs to accommodate higher bit rate transmissions. The use of multiple-beam
architectures  also  increases  bandwidth  availability  through  frequency  reuse.  Advances  in  multibeam  satellites
