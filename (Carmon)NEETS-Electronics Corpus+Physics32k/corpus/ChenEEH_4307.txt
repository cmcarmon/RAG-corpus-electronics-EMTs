Fiber Bragg Gratings
Commercially available ﬁber Bragg gratings have been im-
portant components for enabling WDM and optical networks.
A ﬁber Bragg grating is a small section of ﬁber that has been
modiﬁed to create periodic changes in the index of refraction.
Depending on the space between the changes, a certain fre-
quency of light—the Bragg resonance wavelength—is reﬂected
back, while all other wavelengths pass through (see Figure 8.5).
The wavelength-speciﬁc properties of the grating make ﬁber
Bragg gratings useful in implementing optical add/drop multi-
plexers. Bragg gratings also are being developed to aid in
dispersion compensation and signal ﬁltering as well.
