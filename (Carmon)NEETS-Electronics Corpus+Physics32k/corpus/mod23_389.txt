Before we get into disk handling and storage procedures, let's first learn about head-to-disk contact. 
Do you remember reading in chapter 2 that the quality of magnetic tape recording is seriously degraded 
when dust, dirt, or other contaminates get between the magnetic head and the tape? Well, the same is true 
for magnetic disk recording. In fact, head-to-disk contact is extremely important with floppy disks. This is 
because floppy disk drives, unlike magnetic tape drives, spin at very high speeds â€” 300 to 600 
revolutions-per-minute (RPM). If anything gets between the head and the recording surface, you can lose 
data, or even worse, you can damage the magnetic head and the disk's recording surface. Figure 8-3 
shows the size relationship between a disk drive's magnetic head, the disk recording surface, and some 
common contaminants.
