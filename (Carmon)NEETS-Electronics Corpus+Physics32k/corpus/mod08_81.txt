Earlier in this module it was stated that almost every electronic device contains at least one stage of 
amplification. Many devices contain several stages of amplification and therefore several amplifiers. 
Stages of amplification are added when a single stage will not provide the required amount of 
amplification. For example, if a single stage of amplification will provide a maximum gain of 100 and the 
desired gain from the device is 1000, two stages of amplification will be required. The two stages might 
have gains of 10 and 100, 20 and 50, or 25 and 40. (The overall gain is the product of the individual 
stages-10 × 100 = 20 × 50 = 25 × 40 = 1000.)
