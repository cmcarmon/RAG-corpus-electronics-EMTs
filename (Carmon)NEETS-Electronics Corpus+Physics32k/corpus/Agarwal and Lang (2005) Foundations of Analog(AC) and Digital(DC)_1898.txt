graph plotted on a log-log scale in Figure 13.17 is much more revealing. The
corresponding phase graph is also plotted on a log scale. Notice the interesting
frequency related behavior of the magnitude and phase plots in Figure 13.17.
The log plot reveals that both low and high frequencies are severely
attenuated.
