The Ancient Egyptians were one of the first cultures to widely divide days into generally agreed-upon equal parts, using early timekeeping devices such as sundials, shadow clocks, and merkhets (plumb-lines used by early astronomers). Obelisks are used by reading the shadow that it makes. The citizens could divide the day into two parts, and then into smaller hours.
