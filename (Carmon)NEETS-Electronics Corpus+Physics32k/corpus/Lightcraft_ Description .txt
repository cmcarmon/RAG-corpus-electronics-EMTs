When a lightcraft is in the atmosphere, air is used as the propellant material (reaction mass). In space, a lightcraft would need to provide the propellant material from onboard tanks or from an ablative solid. By leaving the vehicle's power source on the ground and by using ambient atmosphere as reaction mass for much of its ascent, a lightcraft could potentially be capable of delivering a very large percentage of its launch mass to orbit. It could also potentially be inexpensive to manufacture.
At the current stage of development, the bottom-lasered type of lightcraft exist as small hand-sized test specimens which have attained altitudes of a few hundred feet. In 1999, tests by Leik Myrabo in cooperation with the US Army at White Sands Missile Range demonstrated the basic feasibility of using ground-based lasers to propel objects in this way. The test succeeded in reaching over one hundred feet, which compares to Robert Goddard's first test flight of his rocket design. In 2000, a new flight record was set with a flight lasting 10.5 seconds and reaching 72 meters (236 feet).
A lightcraft's propulsion is dependent on the external laser's power and so propulsive power is not limited to that generated by on-board machinery (rockets).
