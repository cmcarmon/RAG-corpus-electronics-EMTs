Figure 10.61 shows one possible circuit for a static memory element. In this
circuit, a non-ideal switch with a very high ON resistance is connected between
the power supply and the storage node of the memory element. When the
output of the memory element is a logical 1, this switch is turned on and
introduces a small stream of charge into the storage node to offset any leakage.
Because it trickles charges into the node, this switch is called a trickle switch.
The ON resistance of the trickle switch is made very large compared to the
ON resistance of the store switch, so that the trickle input can be overridden
easily by the input dIN. A detailed circuit design of the static latch is beyond
the scope of this book. The interested reader is referred to ‘Principles of CMOS
VLSI Design,’ by Weste and Eshraghian.
