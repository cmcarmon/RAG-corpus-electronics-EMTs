is satisﬁed by a state M if and only if M[p] is true.
A transition is a particular kind of predicate that contains
primed state variables (e.g., [p0(c) ¼ p(c) þ 1]). A transition
relates two states (an old state and a new state), where the
unprimed state variables refer to the old state and where
the primed state variables refer to the new state. Therefore, the
meaning of a transition is a relation between states. The term
transition used here is a temporal logic entity. Although it
reﬂects the nature of a transition in a PrTN net N, it is
not a transition in N. For example, given a pair of states M
and M0: M[p0(c) ¼ p(c) þ 1]M0
is deﬁned by M0[p(c)] ¼
M[p(c)] þ 1. Given a transition t, a pair of states M and M0
is called a ‘‘transition step’’ if M[p]M0 equals true.
