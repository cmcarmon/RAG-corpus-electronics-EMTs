We have chosen this primitive case for demonstration
only. Practical synthesis steps usually require voltage transfer
with a loading resistor and with an input resistor. The
steps that extract properties of the LC two-port are more
complicated but are available in books focusing on synthesis
of Ô¨Ålters.
