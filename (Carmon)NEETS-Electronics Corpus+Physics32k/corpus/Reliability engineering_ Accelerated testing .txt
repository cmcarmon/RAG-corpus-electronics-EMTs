The purpose of accelerated life testing (ALT test) is to induce field failure in the laboratory at a much faster rate by providing a harsher, but nonetheless representative, environment. In such a test, the product is expected to fail in the lab just as it would have failed in the field—but in much less time. The main objective of an accelerated test is either of the following:

To discover failure modes
To predict the normal field life from the high stress lab life

An Accelerated testing program can be broken down into the following steps:

Define objective and scope of the test
Collect required information about the product
Identify the stress(es)
Determine level of stress(es)
Conduct the accelerated test and analyze the collected data.

Common way to determine a life stress relationship are

Arrhenius model
Eyring model
Inverse power law model
Temperature–humidity model
Temperature non-thermal model
