tr as the time taken for the clock signal to rise from a valid output low voltage
(VOL) to a valid high output voltage (VOH). Let us also define the fall time tf
as the time taken for the clock signal to fall from a valid output high voltage
(VOH) to a valid low output voltage (VOL). As is clear from Figure 10.43, to
yield a valid digital clock signal, the clock time period must satisfy the following
constraint:
