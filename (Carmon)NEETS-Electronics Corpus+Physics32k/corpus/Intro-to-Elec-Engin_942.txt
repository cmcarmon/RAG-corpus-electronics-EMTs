11.2.5 Consider the toroid shown in Figure P11.2.5(a)
made up of three ferromagnetic materials. Ma-
terial a is nickel–iron alloy having a mean arc
length la of 0.6 m; material b is medium sili-
con steel having a mean arc length lb of 0.4 m;
material c is cast steel having a mean arc length
lc of 0.2 m. Each of the materials has a cross-
sectional area of 0.002 m2. Find the mmf needed
to establish a magnetic ﬂux of φ = 1.2 mWb by
making use of the magnetization curves given in
