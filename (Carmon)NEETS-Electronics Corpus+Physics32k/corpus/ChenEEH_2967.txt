A small signal equivalent model, including external parasi-
tics, for the MOSFET transistor in common-source mode is
shown in Figure 11.6. Each component is deﬁned to the right
of the equivalent circuit, with typical values for a GaAs
MOSFET with a gate length of 1 mm and a gate width of
250 mm given in parentheses. There are many minor variations
of this model. Often, the drain-to-source resistance, rds, is
omitted. In addition, when the gate-to-drain feedback capaci-
tance is small enough to be neglected, it is replaced with an
open circuit, resulting in the simpliﬁed unilateral model for a
common-source GaAs FET.
