The clocked flip-flop is controlled by the logic state 
of the S and R inputs when a clock pulse is present. A 
change in the state of the flip-flop occurs only when 
the leading edge of the clock pulse is applied. The 
leading edge of the clock pulse is a positive-going tran-
sition (low to high). This means that the pulse goes 
from a zero voltage level to a positive voltage level. 
This is referred to as positive-edge-triggered (the edge 
of the pulse is what triggers the circuit).
