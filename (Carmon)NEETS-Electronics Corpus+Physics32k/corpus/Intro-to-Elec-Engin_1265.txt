13.4.5 A 20-hp, 250-V shunt motor has a total armature-
circuit resistance of 0.25  and a ﬁeld-circuit
resistance of 200 . At no load and rated voltage,
the speed is 1200 r/min, and the line current is
4.5 A. At full load and rated voltage, the line
current is 65 A. Assume the ﬁeld ﬂux to be
reduced by 6% from its value at no load, due
to the demagnetizing effect of armature reaction.
Compute the full-load speed.
