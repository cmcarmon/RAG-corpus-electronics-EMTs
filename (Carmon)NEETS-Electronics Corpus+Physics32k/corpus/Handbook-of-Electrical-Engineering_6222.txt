Antenna Systems
FM broadcast antenna systems are required to have a horizontally polarized component. Most antenna systems,
however, are circularly polarized, having both horizontal and vertical components. The antenna system, which
usually  consists  of  several  individual  radiating  bays  fed  as  a  phased  array,  has  a  radiation  characteristic  that
concentrates the transmitted energy in the horizontal plane toward the population to be served, minimizing
the radiation out into space and down toward the ground. Thus, the ERP towards the horizon is increased with
gains up to 10 dB. This means that a 5-kW transmitter coupled to an antenna system with a 10-dB gain would have
an ERP of 50 kW. Directional antennas may be employed to avoid interference with other stations or to meet spacing
requirements. Figure 69.15 is a plot of the horizontal and vertical components of a typical nondirectional circularly
polarized FM broadcast antenna showing the effect upon the pattern caused by the supporting tower.
