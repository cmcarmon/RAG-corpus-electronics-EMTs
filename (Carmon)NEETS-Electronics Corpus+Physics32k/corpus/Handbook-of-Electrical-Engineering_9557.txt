An expert system typically has three major components: the dialog structure, inference engine, and knowledge
base [Liebowitz and DeSalvo, 1989]. The dialog structure is the user interface that allows the user to interact
with the expert system. Most expert systems are able to explain their reasoning, in the same manner that one
would want human experts to explain their decisions. The inference engine is the control structure within the
expert system that houses the search strategies to allow the expert system to arrive at various conclusions. The
third  component  is  the knowledge base,  which  is  the  set  of  facts  and  heuristics  (rules  of  thumb)  about  the
speciÔ¨Åc domain task. The knowledge principle says that the power of the expert system lies in its knowledge
base. Expert system shells have been developed and are widely used on various platforms to help one build an
expert  system  and  concentrate  on  the  knowledge  base  construction.  Most  operational  expert  systems  are
integrated with existing databases, spreadsheets, optimization modules, or information systems [Mockler and
Dologite, 1992].
