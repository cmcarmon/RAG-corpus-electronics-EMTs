When the capacitance is increased sufficiently, full integration of the input signal takes place in the 
output across the capacitor. An example of complete integration is shown in figure 4-32 (waveform eC). 
This effect can be caused by significantly decreasing the value of capacitive reactance. The same effect 
would take place by increasing the value of the resistance. Integration takes place in an RC circuit when 
the output is taken across the capacitor.
