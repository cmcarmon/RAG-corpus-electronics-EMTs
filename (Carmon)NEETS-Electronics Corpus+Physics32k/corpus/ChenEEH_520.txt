Electrons and holes experience a chaotic random thermal
motion. The average kinetic energy of thermal motion per
one electron is 3kBT =2, where T is temperature in degrees
Kelvin and kB is the Boltzmann constant. The electron thermal
velocity, vthn, is found by equating the electron kinetic energy
to 3kBT =2:
