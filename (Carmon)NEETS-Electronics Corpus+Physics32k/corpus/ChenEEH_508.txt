FIGURE 6.5 The Face-Centered Cubic (fcc) and Zinc Blende Struc-
ture. This structure is formed by two interpenetrating fcc lattices
shifted by one quarter of the body diagonal (similar to diamond
structure). Thick lines show the bonds between an atom and its
four nearest neighbors (tetrahedral bond conÔ¨Åguration). The a is
the lattice constant. Figure adapted from Shur (1996).
