time it takes depends on a few things, such as the characteristics of the 
inductor and the size of the resistor in the circuit. See the next section, 
“Calculating the RL time constant.”) When this happens, the current flows 
freely through the inductor, which acts like a simple wire (commonly 
referred to as a short circuit, or simply a short), so VL is nearly 0 V (a tiny volt-
age is dropped across the inductor due to the resistance of the coil’s wire) 
and the steady‐state current is determined by the source voltage and the
