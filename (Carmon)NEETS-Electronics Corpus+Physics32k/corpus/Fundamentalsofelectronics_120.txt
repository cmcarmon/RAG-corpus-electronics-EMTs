resistor you can hold in your hand is not exactly an ideal 1 kΩ resistor. First of all, physical devices
are manufactured to close tolerances (the tighter the tolerance, the more money you pay), but never have
exactly their advertised values. The fourth band on resistors speciﬁes their tolerance; 10% is common. More
pertinent to the current discussion is another deviation from the ideal: If a sinusoidal voltage is placed across
a physical resistor, the current will not be exactly proportional to it as frequency becomes high, say above
1 MHz. At very high frequencies, the way the resistor is constructed introduces inductance and capacitance
eﬀects. Thus, the smart engineer must be aware of the frequency ranges over which his ideal models match
reality well.
