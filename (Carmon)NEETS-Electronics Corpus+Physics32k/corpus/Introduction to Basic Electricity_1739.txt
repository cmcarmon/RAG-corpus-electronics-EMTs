After completing this chapter, the student will be 
able to:
Identify the three basic parts of a circuit.
Identify three types of circuit configurations.
Describe how current flow can be varied in  
a circuit.
State Ohm’s law with reference to current, 
voltage, and resistance.
Solve problems using Ohm’s law for current, 
resistance, or voltage in series, parallel, and 
series-parallel circuits.
Describe how the total current flow differs 
between series and parallel circuits.
Describe how the total voltage drop differs 
between series and parallel circuits.
Describe how the total resistance differs 
between series and parallel circuits.
State and apply Kirchhoff’s current and  
voltage laws.
Verify answers using Ohm’s law with  
Kirchhoff’s law.
