The gain magnitude, represented by decibels deÔ¨Åned as
20 log10 [A(v)], is plotted on the y-axis of magnitude plot.
Since A(v) dB can be both positive and negative, the y-axis has
both positive and negative values. Zero dB corresponds to a
magnitude function of unity. The y-axis for the phase function
uses a linear scale in radians or degrees. Semilog graph paper
makes it convenient to sketch Bode plots.
