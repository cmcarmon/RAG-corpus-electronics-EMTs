In some semiconductors, such as silicon, the hole's effective mass is dependent on direction (anisotropic), however a value averaged over all directions can be used for some macroscopic calculations.
In most semiconductors, the effective mass of a hole is much larger than that of an electron. This results in lower mobility for holes under the influence of an electric field and this may slow down the speed of the electronic device made of that semiconductor. This is one major reason for adopting electrons as the primary charge carriers, whenever possible in semiconductor devices, rather than holes. Also, why NMOS logic is faster than PMOS logic.
However, in many semiconductor devices, both electrons and holes play an essential role. Examples include pâ€“n diodes, bipolar transistors, and CMOS logic.
