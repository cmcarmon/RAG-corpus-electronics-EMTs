Applications
Developing  an  application  is  made  easier  and  more  ﬂexible  when  based  over  standard API  and  middleware
products.  The  challenge  remains,  however,  to  respond  to  the  new  needs  of  the  industry.  Applications  must
integrate security schemes to avoid holes and prevent piracy of a system. To secure their system, applications
developers must be aware of the complete structure of the operating system they are using. For instance, the
market proposes new software to protect access to a computer and to encrypt ﬁles on computers. Such a system
requires low level control of the resources of a computer to block unexpected entry. Also, sensitive information
must not be exposed. Encryption keys are never kept clearly in memory to prevent software attack.
