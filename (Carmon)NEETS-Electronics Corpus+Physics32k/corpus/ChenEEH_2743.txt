The D~vvaniso is useful in quantifying wavefront distortion. For
example, a circular cylindrical wave would suffer progressive
distortion of its wavefront since the portions propagating
along the grid diagonals would travel slightly faster than the
portions traveling along the major grid axes. For example,
from Figure 9.4 and equations 9.35b and 9.36b, D~vvaniso ¼
0:208% for Nl ¼ 20. The wavefront distortion due to this
anisotropy would total about 2.1 cells for each 1,000 cells of
propagation distance.
