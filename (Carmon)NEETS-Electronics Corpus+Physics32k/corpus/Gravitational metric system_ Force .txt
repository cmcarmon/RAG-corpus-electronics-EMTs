In English contexts the unit of force is usually formed by simply appending the suffix "force" to the name of the unit of mass, thus gram-force (gf) or kilogram-force (kgf, which follows the tradition of pound-force (lbf). In other, international contexts the special name pond (p) or kilopond (kp) respectively is more frequent.
1 p = 1 gf
= 1 g ⋅ gn = 9.80665 g⋅m/s2 = 980.665 g⋅cm/s2 = 980.665 dyn
1 kp = 1 kgf
= 1 kg ⋅ gn = 9.80665 kg⋅m/s2 = 980665 g⋅cm/s2
