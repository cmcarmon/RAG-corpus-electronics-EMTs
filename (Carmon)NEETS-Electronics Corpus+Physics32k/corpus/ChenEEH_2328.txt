The Smith chart is used in several applications, including
microwave measurements, instrument displays, and computer-
aided design of microwave circuits. For example, impedance
matching networks such as single-stub and double-stub tuners
or quarter-wave transformers can be conveniently designed
using the Smith chart (see Cheng [1989] in Appendix A for
further reading). For space limitations, these applications are
not presented in this chapter. The reader is referred to Appen-
dix A at the end of the chapter for several useful references
illustrating microwave circuit design utilizing the Smith chart.
