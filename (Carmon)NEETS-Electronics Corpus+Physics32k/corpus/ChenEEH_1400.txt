To quantify the advantages of run-time reconﬁgurable
designs, Wirthlin and Hutchings (1998) introduced a metric
called functional density that measures the computational
throughput (operations per second) of unit hardware re-
sources. This metric can be used to identify the conditions
under which a run-time reconﬁgured circuit provides higher
functional density than its statically conﬁgured alternative.
Several applications, including neural nets, template matching,
and DNA sequence matching, are used to illustrate the supe-
riority of run-time reconﬁgurable implementations.
