Silicone liquids consist of polymeric chains of silicon atoms alternating with oxygen atoms, with methyl side
groups. For electrical applications, polydimethylsiloxane ﬂuids are used, primarily for transformers as substi-
tutes  for  the  PCBs  due  to  their  inherently  high  ﬂash  and  ﬂammability  points  and  reduced  environmental
concerns. They have lower tand values than mineral oils but somewhat higher dielectric constants because of
their moderately polar nature. The viscosity of silicone ﬂuids exhibits relatively little change with temperature,
which  is  attributed  to  the  ease  of  rotation  about  the  Si–O–Si  bond,  thereby  overcoming  close  packing  of
molecules and reducing intermolecular forces.
