The  macroscopic  quantum  nature  of  superconductivity  can  be  usefully  exploited  to  create  a  new  type  of
electronic  device.  Because  all  the  superelectrons  exhibit  correlated  motion,  the  usual  wave–particle  duality
normally associated with a single quantum particle can now be applied to the entire ensemble of superelectrons.
Thus, there is a spatiotemporal phase associated with the ensemble that characterizes the supercurrent ﬂowing
in the material.
