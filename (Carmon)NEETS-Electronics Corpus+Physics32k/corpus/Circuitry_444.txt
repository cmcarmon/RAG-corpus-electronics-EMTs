Multivibrators 
 
There  are  many  occasions  when  we  require  a 
square wave output from an oscillator rather than a 
sine  wave  output.  Multivibrators  are  a  family  of 
oscillator  circuits  that  produce  output  waveforms 
consisting  of  one  or  more  rectangular  pulses.  The 
term ‘multivibrator’ simply originates from the fact 
that this type of waveform is rich in harmonics (i.e. 
‘multiple vibrations’). 
  Multivibrators  use  regenerative  (i.e.  positive) 
feedback;  the  active  devices  present  within  the 
oscillator circuit being operated as switches, being 
alternately cut off and driven into saturation. 
 The principal types of multivibrator are: 
 
(a)  astable  multivibrators 
that  provide  a 
continuous  train  of  pulses  (these  are  sometimes 
also referred to as free-running multivibrators) 
 
(b)  monostable  multivibrators  that  produce  a 
single output pulse (they have one stable state and 
are thus sometimes also referred to as ‘one-shot’) 
 
(c)  bistable  multivibrators  that  have  two  stable 
states and require a trigger pulse or control signal 
to change from one state to another.
