Harmonic distortion is the production of harmonic frequencies by an electronic system when a signal
is applied at the input. When an input signal goes through nonlinear electronic circuitry, the output signal
will include some harmonic distortion (or unwanted frequencies). If you analyzed this distortion, you’d
see that a pattern exists. A pattern, whereby the frequency of each unwanted frequency is a multiple
( · 1, · 2, · 3, etc.) of the center frequency of the input signal.
