Surface Barrier Detector
Surface barrier junctions are fabricated by either evaporating gold onto n-type silicon or aluminum onto p-type
silicon. A typical entrance window is equivalent to 80 nm of silicon. The rectiﬁcation properties depend on the
charge  density  of  surface  states  of  the  silicon  and  of  the  thin  oxide  layer  over  the  silicon,  as  well  as  on  the
evaporated  metal.  The  wafer  is  epoxied  in  an  insulating  ring  before  metallization.  The  ﬁnished  detector  is
encapsulated in a can that has a front window for particle entry and a single contact in the back for the combined
function  of  applying  bias  and  for  extracting  the  signal  pulse.  Devices  can  be  operated  either  in  the  partially
depleted or totally depleted mode. As fabrication is entirely at room temperature, there is no opportunity for
metal  contamination  by  diffusion.  Generally,  surface  barrier  detectors  have  lower  leakage  current,  and  less
system  noise  than  a  diffused  junction  detector  of  comparable  area  and  depth.  However,  detectors  currently
fabricated  by  ion  implantation  have  still  lower  leakage  current  and  electronic  noise,  together  with  a  thinner
and more rugged front contact. On the other hand, implanted detectors are not available in the same range of
active thicknesses as surface barrier detectors. Below 100 µ and above 500 µ, only surface barrier detectors are
currently available. Surface barrier detectors can be made in small quantities with rather simple equipment.
