Examination of this problem formulation reveals that it is of the same form treated in Theorem 1 in which
the Hilbert space is Cn. In view of criterion (14.83) that is to be minimized, the inner product identifying this
Hilbert space is taken to be <x, y> ” x*Wy. It is a simple matter to show that this measure satisﬁes the three
axioms of an inner product. The closed subspace C corresponds to the set of all vectors that are expressible as
Ha (i.e., the range space of matrix H). Since matrix H is taken to have full column rank n, it follows that C has
dimension n. If in a given application the elements of the coefﬁcient vector a can take on complex values, it is
readily shown that the orthogonal projection matrix PC is speciﬁed by
