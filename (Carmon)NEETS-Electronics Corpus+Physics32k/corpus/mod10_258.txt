Another phenomenon common to most radio waves is the bending of the waves as they move from 
one medium into another in which the velocity of propagation is different. This bending of the waves is 
called refraction. For example, suppose you are driving down a smoothly paved road at a constant speed 
and suddenly one wheel goes off onto the soft shoulder. The car tends to veer off to one side. The change 
of medium, from hard surface to soft shoulder, causes a change in speed or velocity. The tendency is for 
the car to change direction. This same principle applies to radio waves as changes occur in the medium 
through which they are passing. As an example, the radio wave shown in figure 2-8 is traveling through 
the Earth's atmosphere at a constant speed. As the wave enters the dense layer of electrically charged ions, 
the part of the wave that enters the new medium first travels faster than the parts of the wave that have not 
yet entered the new medium. This abrupt increase in velocity of the upper part of the wave causes the 
wave to bend back toward the Earth. This bending, or change of direction, is always toward the medium 
that has the lower velocity of propagation.
