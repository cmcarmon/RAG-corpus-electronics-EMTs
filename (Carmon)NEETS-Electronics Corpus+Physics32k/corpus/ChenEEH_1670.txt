poses an overhead in the most likely scenario of more and
more image content being stored in compressed form due to
the success of image coding standards like JPEG and JPEG-
2000. A better approach toward this issue in many of the
modern systems is to process compressed domain images as
a Ô¨Årst class and default medium (i.e., compressed images
should be operated upon directly). Since compressed domain
representation either has all (if it is a lossless coding scheme)
or most of the important (if it is a lossy scheme, depending on
the quantization setting in the encoder) image information
intact, indexing based on image content can be performed
from minimal decoding of compressed images.
