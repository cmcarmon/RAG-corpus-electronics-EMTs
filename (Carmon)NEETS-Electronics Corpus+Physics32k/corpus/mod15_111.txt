There are two types of differential units - differential transmitters and differential receivers. The 
differential transmitter (TDX) accepts one electrical input and one mechanical input and produces one 
electrical output. The differential receiver (TDR) accepts two electrical inputs and produces one 
mechanical output. A comparison of the TDX and TDR is shown in figure 1-18. The torque differential 
transmitter and the torque differential receiver can be used to form a DIFFERENTIAL SYNCHRO 
SYSTEM. The system can consist either of a torque transmitter (TX), a torque differential transmitter 
(TDX), and a torque receiver (TR), (TX-TDX-TR); or two torque transmitters (TXs) and one torque 
differential receiver (TDR), (TX-TDR-TX). Before beginning a discussion of the systems using 
differentials, we need to provide a brief explanation on the newly introduced synchros, the TDX and the 
TDR.
