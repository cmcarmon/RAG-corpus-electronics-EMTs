Resistance and temperature 
 
Figure  2.14  shows  how  the  resistance  of  a  metal 
conductor  (e.g.  copper)  varies  with  temperature. 
Since  the  resistance  of  the  material  increases  with 
temperature,  this  characteristic  is  said  to  exhibit  a 
positive  temperature  coefficient  (PTC). Not  all 
materials have a PTC characteristic. The resistance 
of a carbon conductor falls with temperature and it 
is therefore said to exhibit a negative temperature 
coefficient (NTC).
