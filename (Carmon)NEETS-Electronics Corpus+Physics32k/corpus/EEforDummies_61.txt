 personally),  with  charged  particles  traveling 
from one cloud to another or from a cloud to the 
ground. The energy resulting from the move-
ment  of  these  charged  particles  causes  the 
air surrounding the charges to rapidly heat up 
to nearly 20,000 Celsius â€” lighting the air and 
creating an audible shock wave better known 
as thunder.
If  you  can  get  enough  charged  particles  to 
move around and can control their movement, 
you can use the resulting electrical energy to 
power light bulbs and other things.
