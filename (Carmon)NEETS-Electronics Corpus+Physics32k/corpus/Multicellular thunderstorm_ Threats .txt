Any severe activity in one of these storms will most likely come from the dominant cell near or after its peak updraft strength. This is because there could be severe hail from a strong updraft that lasts only a short period of time, with damaging winds.
Rain is an important impact of such systems. The speed and direction at which the entire cluster of thunderstorms move downstream make the difference in the amount of rain received in any one location. Individual cells might move downstream but additional cells forming upwind of the cluster can move directly over the path of the previous cell, forming training echoes.
A multicellular storm can sometimes develop into a Mesoscale Convective System (MCS) or be a squall line. Updrafts reform new cells continually at the leading edge of system with rain and hail following behind. Individual thunderstorm updrafts and downdrafts along the line can become strong, producing large hail and strong outflow of straight-line winds ahead of system. Tornadoes are only occasionally reported. In certain conditions, squall line can extend on a very long line, moving extremely rapidly, and become a derecho.
