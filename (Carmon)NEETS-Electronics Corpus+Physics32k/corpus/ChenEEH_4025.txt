. ARREST (Burleson and Jung, 1992) extracts dependency
vectors from an afﬁne recurrence equation (ARE) de-
scription and generates the corresponding DG. Users are
allowed to explore design space using a number of pro-
vided DG transformations. An SFG is obtained from
afﬁne transformation according to user-speciﬁed sched-
uling and projection vectors (Kung, 1988). ARREST per-
mits the user to verify the functionality via a Verilog
simulator and cost/performance tradeoff of different
design decisions.
