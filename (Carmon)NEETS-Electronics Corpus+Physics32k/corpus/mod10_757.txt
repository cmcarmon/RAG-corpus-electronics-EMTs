The rhombic antenna is not without its disadvantages. The principal one is that a fairly large antenna 
site is required for its erection. Each leg is made at least 1 or 2 wavelengths long at the lowest operating 
frequency. When increased gain and directivity are required, legs of from 8 to 12 wavelengths are used. 
These requirements mean that high-frequency rhombic antennas have wires of several hundred feet in 
length. Therefore, they are used only when a large plot of land is available.
