One solution to this dilemma is to make your own resistor out of a length of special high-
resistance wire. Usually, a small ”bobbin” is used as a form for the resulting wire coil, and
the coil is wound in such a way as to eliminate any electromagnetic effects: the desired wire
length is folded in half, and the looped wire wound around the bobbin so that current through
the wire winds clockwise around the bobbin for half the wire’s length, then counter-clockwise
for the other half. This is known as a biﬁlar winding. Any magnetic ﬁelds generated by
the current are thus canceled, and external magnetic ﬁelds cannot induce any voltage in the
resistance wire coil:
