The speech communication system may simply be a recording which was performed in a noisy environment,
a  standard  digital  or  analog  communication  system,  or  a  speech  recognition  system  for  human-machine
communication. The noise may be present at the input of the communication system, in the channel, or at the
receiving end. The noise may be correlated or uncorrelated with the signal. It may accompany the clean signal
in an additive, multiplicative, or any other more general manner. Examples of noise sources include competitive
speech; background sounds like music, a fan, machines, door slamming, wind, and trafÔ¨Åc; room reverberation;
and white Gaussian channel noise.
