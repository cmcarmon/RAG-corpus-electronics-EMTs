Trafﬁc Shaping and Policing
After a trafﬁc stream gets admitted with a given QoS require-
ment and a given trafﬁc descriptor, it becomes binding on the
source to stick to that proﬁle. If a rogue source breaks its
contract and sends more than what it had bargained for,
there will be breakdown in the service model. To prevent this
possibility, trafﬁc shaping and policing becomes essential.
