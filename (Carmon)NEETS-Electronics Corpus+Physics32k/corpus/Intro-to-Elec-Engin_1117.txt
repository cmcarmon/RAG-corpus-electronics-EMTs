ﬂow of mechanical power. At standstill, however, the machine acts as a simple transformer with
an air gap and a short-circuited secondary winding. The frequency of the rotor-induced emf is
the same as the stator frequency at standstill. At any value of the slip under balanced steady-state
operation, the rotor current reacts on the stator winding at the stator frequency because the rotating
magnetic ﬁelds caused by the stator and rotor are stationary with respect to each other.
