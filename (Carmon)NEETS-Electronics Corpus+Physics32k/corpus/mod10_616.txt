For frequencies in the vhf or uhf range, either horizontal or vertical polarization is satisfactory. These 
radio waves travel directly from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna without entering the 
ionosphere. The original polarization produced at the transmitting antenna is maintained throughout the 
entire travel of the wave to the receiver. Therefore, if a horizontally polarized antenna is used for 
transmitting, a horizontally polarized antenna must be used for receiving. The requirements would be the 
same for a vertical transmitting and receiving antenna system.
