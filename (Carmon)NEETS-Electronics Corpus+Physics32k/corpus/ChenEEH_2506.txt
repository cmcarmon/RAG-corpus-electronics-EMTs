electrically small with respect to the wavelength. Lumped-
element equivalent circuits can be developed to represent
these discontinuities. A lumped-element representation of a
transmission line discontinuity, such as bend or gap, is im-
portant in the design and analysis of passive microwave cir-
cuits and components. Values for the lumped elements can be
obtained from either Ô¨Åeld theoretical computations, measure-
ments, or empirical formulas.
