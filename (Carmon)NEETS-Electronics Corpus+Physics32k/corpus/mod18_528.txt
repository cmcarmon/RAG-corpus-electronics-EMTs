Radar peak power may reach a million watts or more. Rf radiation hazards exist in the vicinity of 
radar transmitting antennas. These hazards are present not only in front of an antenna but also to the sides 
and sometimes even behind it because of spillover and reflection. At some frequencies, exposure to 
excessive levels of radiation will not produce a sufficient sensation of pain or discomfort to warn you of 
injury. If you suspect any injury, see your ship's doctor or corpsman. Be sure to acquaint yourself with the 
actual radiation hazard zones of the radars on your ship.
