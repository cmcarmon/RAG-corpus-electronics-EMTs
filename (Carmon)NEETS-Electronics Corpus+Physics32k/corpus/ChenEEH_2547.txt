The parallel-line coupler is not restricted to TEM-mode
structures although its earliest versions were made from
coaxial- or strip-coupled lines, which support pure TEM-
modes. The microstrip parallel-line coupler supports quasi-
TEM-mode propagation, whereas non-TEM mode couplers
may be in the form of a dielectric waveguide, a rectangular
waveguide, and slot lines that are known to be dispersive.
