When sinusoidal basis functions are used, the modulated signal consists of segments of periodic waveforms
corresponding to the individual symbols. A unique segment of analog waveform corresponds to each symbol.
If the spread spectrum technique is not used, the transmitted signal is narrow-band. Consequently, multipath
propagation can cause high attenuation or even dropout of the transmitted narrow-band signal.
