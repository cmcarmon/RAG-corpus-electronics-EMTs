dividing or two-to-one equal power combining function over a
broad bandwidth. Two Wilkinson dividers are shown in Figure
7.24. This type of divider can be designed to give an arbitrary
ratio of power division at the outputs. It is a well-known fact
that a lossless reciprocal passive three-port junction cannot be
matched at all ports simultaneously. In the Wilkinson power
divider/combiner, a resistor is introduced to bridge the two
output ports for improving their isolation, which is usually
called ‘‘resistor of isolation.’’ The resistor is placed l=4 away
from the junction and can be considered as the fourth port.
