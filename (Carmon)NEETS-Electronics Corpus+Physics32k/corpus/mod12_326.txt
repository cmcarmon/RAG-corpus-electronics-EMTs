Look at figure 2-28 and observe the relative amplitudes of the sidebands as they relate to the
amplitudes of the harmonics contained in the square wave. Note that the first set of sidebands is directly
related to the amplitude of the square wave. The second set of sidebands is related to the third harmonic
content of the square wave and is 1/3 the amplitude of the first set. The third set is related to the amplitude
of the first set of sidebands and is 115 the amplitude of the first set. This relationship will apply to each
additional set of sidebands.
