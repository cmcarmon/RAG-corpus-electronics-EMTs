A flow is irrotational if the curl of




u



{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} }
is zero:




∇
×

u

=
0.


{\displaystyle \nabla \times \mathbf {u} =0.}

That is, if




u



{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} }
is an irrotational vector field.
A flow in a simply-connected domain which is irrotational can be described as a potential flow, through the use of a velocity potential



Φ
,


{\displaystyle \Phi ,}
with




u

=
∇
Φ
.


{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} =\nabla \Phi .}
If the flow is both irrotational and incompressible, the Laplacian of the velocity potential must be zero:



Δ
Φ
=
0.


{\displaystyle \Delta \Phi =0.}
