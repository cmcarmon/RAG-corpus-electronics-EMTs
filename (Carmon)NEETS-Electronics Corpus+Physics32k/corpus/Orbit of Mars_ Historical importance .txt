A German astronomer, Johannes Kepler (1571-1630) formulated three laws of planetary motion. A key discovery was that the motion of Mars followed an elliptical path. His model with a circular orbit did not match the observations of Mars. The planet's pronounced eccentricity was key in discovering the non-circularity of its orbit, and consequently of orbits in general.
