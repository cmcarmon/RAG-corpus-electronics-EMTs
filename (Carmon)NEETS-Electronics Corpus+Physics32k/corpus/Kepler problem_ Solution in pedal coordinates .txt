If we restrict ourselves to the orbiting plane, there is an easy way how to obtain a rough shape of the orbit (without the information about parametrization) in pedal coordinates. Remember that a given point



x


{\displaystyle x}
on a curve in pedal coordinates is given by two numbers



(
r
,
p
)


{\displaystyle (r,p)}
, where



r
:=

|

x

|



{\displaystyle r:=|x|}
is the distance from the origin and



p
:=



x
⋅




x
˙




⊥





|




x
˙

{\displaystyle p:={\frac {x\cdot {\dot {x}}^{\perp }}{|{\dot {x}}|}}}
is the distance of the origin to the tangent line at



x


{\displaystyle x}
(the symbol







x
˙




⊥




{\displaystyle {\dot {x}}^{\perp }}
stands for a vector perpendicular to






x
˙





{\displaystyle {\dot {x}}}
—exact orientation is unimportant here).
The Kepler problem in a plane asks for a solution of the system of differential equations:

{\displaystyle {\ddot {x}}=-{\frac {M}{|x|^{3}}}x,\qquad x\in \mathbb {R} ^{2},}

where



M


{\displaystyle M}
is the product of the gravitational body's mass and gravitational constant. Making the scalar product of the equation with






x

{\displaystyle {\dot {x}}}
we obtain

Integrating we get the first conserved quantity

{\displaystyle |{\dot {x}}|^{2}={\frac {2M}{|x|}}+c,}

which corresponds to the energy of the orbiting object. Similarly, making the scalar product with

{\displaystyle p^{2}={\frac {L^{2}}{{\frac {2M}{r}}+c}},\qquad \Rightarrow \qquad {\frac {L^{2}}{p^{2}}}={\frac {2M}{r}}+c,}

which is the equation of the conic section (with the origin at the focus) in pedal coordinates (see pedal equation). Notice that only 2 (out of 4 possible) conserved quantities are needed to obtain the shape of the orbit. This is possible since the pedal coordinates do not describe a curve in full detail. They are generally indifferent to parametrization and also to a rotation of the curve about the origin—which is an advantage if you care only about the general shape of the curve and do not want to be distracted by details.
This approach can be applied to a wide range of central and Lorentz-like force problems as discovered by P. Blaschke in 2017.
