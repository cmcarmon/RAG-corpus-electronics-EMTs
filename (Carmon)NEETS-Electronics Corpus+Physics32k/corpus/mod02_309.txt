The apparent power in an ac circuit has been described as the power the source "sees". As far as the 
source is concerned the apparent power is the power that must be provided to the circuit. You also know 
that the true power is the power actually used in the circuit. The difference between apparent power and 
true power is wasted because, in reality, only true power is consumed. The ideal situation would be for 
apparent power and true power to be equal. If this were the case the power factor would be 1 (unity) or 
100 percent. There are two ways in which this condition can exist. (1) If the circuit is purely resistive or 
(2) if the circuit "appears" purely resistive to the source. To make the circuit appear purely resistive there 
must be no reactance. To have no reactance in the circuit, the inductive reactance (XL) and capacitive 
reactance (X C) must be equal.
