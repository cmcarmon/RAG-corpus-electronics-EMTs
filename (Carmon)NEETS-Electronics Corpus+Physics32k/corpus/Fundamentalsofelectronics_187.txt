This situation occurs because the circuit elements are linear and time-invariant. For example, suppose we
had a circuit element where the voltage equaled the square of the current: v (t) = Ki2 (t). If i (t) = Iej2πf t,
v (t) = KI 2ej2π2f t, meaning that voltage and current no longer had the same frequency and that their ratio
was time-dependent.
