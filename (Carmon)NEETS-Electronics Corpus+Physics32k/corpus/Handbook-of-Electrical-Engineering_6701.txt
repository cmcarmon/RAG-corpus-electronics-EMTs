More recently, FDDI is being thought of as a mechanism to provide LAN interconnection on a site basis,
and a new type of network, the metropolitan-area network (MAN) has been under study for the intercon-
nection  of  LANs  within  a  metropolitan  area.  The  primary  media  conﬁguration  for  MANs  is  a  dual  bus
conﬁguration and it is implemented via the distributed queue, dual bus (DQDB) protocol, also known as IEEE
