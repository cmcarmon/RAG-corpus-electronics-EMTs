In astrophysics, the most popularly known example of superradiance is probably Zel'dovich radiation. Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich picked the case under quantum electrodynamics ("QED") where the region around the equator of a spinning metal sphere is expected to throw off electromagnetic radiation tangentially, and suggested that the case of a spinning gravitational mass, such as a Kerr black hole ought to produce similar coupling effects, and ought to radiate in an analogous way.
This was followed by arguments from Stephen Hawking and others that an accelerated observer near a black hole (e.g. an observer carefully lowered towards the horizon at the end of a rope) ought to see the region inhabited by "real" radiation, whereas for a distant observer this radiation would be said to be "virtual". If the accelerated observer near the event horizon traps a nearby particle and throws it out to the distant observer for capture and study, then for the distant observer, the appearance of the particle can be explained by saying that the physical acceleration of the particle has turned it from a virtual particle into a "real" particle  (see Hawking radiation).
Similar arguments apply for the cases of observers in accelerated frames (Unruh radiation). Cherenkov radiation, electromagnetic radiation emitted by charged particles travelling through a particulate medium at more than the nominal speed of light in that medium, has also been described as "inertial motion superradiance".
