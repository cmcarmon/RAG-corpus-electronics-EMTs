Based on this intuition, consider the simple memory element circuit com-
prising a capacitor and an ideal switch shown in Figure 10.52. The switch is
controlled by the store input and has the circuit model shown in Figure 10.53.
When connected as shown in Figure 10.52, assume that a logical high value
on the store input turns the switch into its ON state, while a logical low value
on the store input turns the switch into its OFF state.
