The process of determining a consistent clock schedule TCD
can be considered as the mathematical problem of minimizing
the clock period TCP under the constraints of equations 4.5
and 4.6. However, there are important practical issues to con-
sider before a clock schedule can be properly implemented. A
clock distribution network must be synthesized such that the
clock signal is delivered to each register with the proper delay
to satisfy the clock skew schedule TCD. Furthermore, this clock
distribution network must be constructed to minimize the
deleterious effects of interconnect impedances and process
parameter variations on the implemented clock schedule. Syn-
thesizing the clock distribution network typically consists of
determining a topology for the network, together with the
circuit design and physical layout of the buffers and intercon-
nect that make up a clock distribution network (Friedman,
1995, 1997).
