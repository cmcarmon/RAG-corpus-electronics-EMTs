Given the least-action there is a natural definition of momentum associated to generalized coordinates; the quantity acting against velocity gives energy. The field has studied two forms, the momentum associated to the Eulerian vector field termed Eulerian diffeomorphic shape momentum, and the momentum associated to the initial coordinates or canonical coordinates termed canonical diffeomorphic shape momentum. Each has a conservation law.The conservation of momentum goes hand in hand with the EL-General. In Computational anatomy,



A
v


{\displaystyle Av}
is the Eulerian Momentum since when integrated against Eulerian velocity



v


{\displaystyle v}
gives energy density; operator



A


{\displaystyle A}
the generalized moment of inertia or inertial operator which acting on the Eulerian velocity gives momentum which is conserved along the geodesic:

Conservation of Eulerian shape momentum was shown in and follows from EL-General; conservation of canonical momentum was shown in
