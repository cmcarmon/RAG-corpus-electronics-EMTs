*Evaluation of speed and accuracy requires that time limitations, the effect of error on safety,
quality, and cost, etc. be considered. For example, leisure reading imposes no restrictions on time,
and errors are seldom costly or unsafe. Reading engineering drawings or a micrometer requires
accuracy  and,  sometimes,  speed.  Properly  positioning  material  in  a  press  or  mill  can  impose
demands on safety, accuracy, and time.
