(cid:1) The static discipline requires digital devices to adhere to a common rep-
resentation for their input and output voltages, and to guarantee that
they interpret correctly inputs that are valid logical signals according to
the common representation, and to produce outputs that are valid logical
signals provided they receive valid logical inputs. By adhering to a common
representation, digital devices based on different technologies or built by
different manufacturers can communicate with each other. The common
representation is specified in terms of four voltage thresholds:
