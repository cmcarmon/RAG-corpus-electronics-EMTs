Ammeter
In order to measure the current through a wire or line of a circuit, an ammeter is connected in
series with the line. A practical ammeter can usually be modeled as a series combination of an
ideal ammeter and an internal resistance RI. The potential difference between the two terminals
of an ideal ammeter is zero, which corresponds to zero internal resistance. There are what are
known as dc ammeters and ac ammeters. An ac ammeter usually measures the rms value of the
time-varying current. Note that for the ammeter to be inserted for measuring current, the circuit
has to be broken, whereas for the voltmeter to be connected for measuring voltage, the circuit
need not be disassembled.
