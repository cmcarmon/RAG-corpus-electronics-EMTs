Class B amplifiers are twice as efficient as class A amplifiers since the amplifying device only 
conducts (and uses power) for half of the input signal. A class B amplifier is used in cases where exactly 
50% of the input signal must be amplified. If less than 50% of the input signal is needed, a class C 
amplifier is used.
