CMOS is faster than NMOS and PMOS, and it uses less power per function than any other logic. While it
is suitable for LSI, it is more expensive and requires somewhat more chip area than NMOS or PMOS. In many
respects  it  is  unsurpassed  for  SSI  and  MSI  applications.  Standard  CMOS  (the  4000  series)  is  as  fast  as  low-
power TTL (74Lxx) and has the largest noise margin of any logic type.
