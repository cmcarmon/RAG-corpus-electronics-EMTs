When an SCR is used in an AC circuit, it is capable 
of conducting only one of the alternations of each AC 
input cycle, the alternation that makes the anode posi-
tive with respect to the cathode. When the gate current 
is applied continuously, the SCR conducts continu-
ously. When the gate current is removed, the SCR 
turns off within one-half of the AC signal and remains 
off until the gate current is reapplied. It should be 
noted that this means only half of the available power 
is applied to the load. It is possible to use the SCR to 
control current during both alternations of each cycle. 
This is accomplished by rectifying the AC signal so
