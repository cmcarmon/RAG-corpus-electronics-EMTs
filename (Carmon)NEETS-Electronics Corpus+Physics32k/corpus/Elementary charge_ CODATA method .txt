In the most recent CODATA adjustments, the elementary charge is not an independently defined quantity. Instead, a value is derived from the relation

c


{\displaystyle e^{2}={\frac {2h\alpha }{\mu _{0}c}}=2h\alpha \epsilon _{0}c}

where h is the Planck constant, α is the fine-structure constant, μ0 is the magnetic constant, ε0 is the electric constant and c is the speed of light. The uncertainty in the value of e is currently determined almost entirely by the uncertainty in the Planck constant.
The most precise values of the Planck constant come from watt balance experiments, which are used to measure the product K2JRK. The most precise values of the fine structure constant come from comparisons of the measured and calculated value of the gyromagnetic ratio of the electron.
