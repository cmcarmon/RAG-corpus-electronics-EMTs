THE NICKEL-CADMIUM CELL, commonly called the NICAD, has the following advantages 
over the lead-acid cell; charges in a shorter period of time, delivers a larger amount of power, stays idle 
longer, and can be charged and discharged many times. The anode is nickel hydroxide, the cathode is 
cadmium hydroxide, and the electrolyte is potassium hydroxide and water.
