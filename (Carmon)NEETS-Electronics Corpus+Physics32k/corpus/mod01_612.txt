To find the voltage dropped across Rl, R2,  and R3, refer to figure 3-54(B). Req1 represents the
parallel network of R2  and R 3. Since the voltage across each branch of a parallel circuit is equal, the
voltage across Req1 (Eeq1) will be equal to the voltage across R2  (ER2) and also equal to the voltage across
R3  (ER3).
