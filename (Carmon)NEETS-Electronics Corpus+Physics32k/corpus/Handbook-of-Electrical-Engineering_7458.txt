The preceding discussion was motivated by the desire to efﬁciently model ﬁlters and nonlinear ampliﬁers. Since
these devices often consume the majority of the processor time, they are given high priority. However, there
are a number of other subsystems that do not resemble ﬁlters. One example is the data source that generates
the message or waveform which must be transmitted. While signal sources may be analog or digital in nature,
we will focus exclusively on binary digital sources. The two basic categories of signals produced by these devices
deterministic and random. When performing worst-case analysis, one will typically produce known,
are known as 
repetitive signal patterns designed to stress a particular subsystem within the overall communication system.
For  example,  a  signal  with  few  transitions  may  stress  the  symbol  synchronization  loops,  while  a  signal  with
many regularly spaced transitions may generate unusually wide bandwidth signals. The generation of this type
of  signal  is  straightforward  and  highly  application  dependent.  To  test  the  nominal  system  performance  one
typically uses a random data sequence. While generation of a truly random signal is arguably impossible [Knuth,
1981], one can easily generate pseudorandom (PN) sequences. PN sequence generators have been extensively
studied since they are used in Monte Carlo integration and simulation [Rubinstein, 1981] programs and in a
variety of wideband and secure communication systems. The two basic structures for generating PN sequences
are binary shift registers (BSRs) and linear congruential algorithms (LCAs).
