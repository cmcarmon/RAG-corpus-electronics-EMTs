Unexpectedly bright visible objects can be produced by gravitational lensing of very distant objects by extremely massive objects closer to Earth. However, this usually occurs with objects much more distant than ASASSN-15lh, and there are no observations indicating the presence of a galaxy cluster suitable to produce a lensing effect.
