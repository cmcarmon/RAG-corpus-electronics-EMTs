e. Digital signal processing, programmable systems. Single-function C3 hardware is evolving to multifunc-
tion capability. Each node or platform will emerge with new capabilities that permits rapid and ﬂexible
reallocation. Current generation tactical military aircraft, as delivered, have virtually no additional space
or weight allowance for new equipments. A desire is to evolve from costly retroﬁtting to a state of software
programmable
insertion and integration. Traditional single-band radio systems will be replaced with 
multiband, multiwaveform systems.
  Near  real-time  management  and  control  of  highly  ﬂexible,  pro-
grammable systems will become a growing research and development thrust. Next generation cellular
technology  involving  hybrids  of  frequency  hopping,  direct  sequence  spread,  and  time  division  spread
spectrum techniques invokes new digital signal processing efforts. Also receiving development is Direct
Satellite Broadcast (DSB) to tactical military units.
