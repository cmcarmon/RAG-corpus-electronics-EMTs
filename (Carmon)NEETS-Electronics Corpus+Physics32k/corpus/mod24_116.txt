The coating or buffer is a layer of material used to protect an optical fiber from physical damage.
The material used for a buffer is a type of plastic. The buffer is elastic in nature and prevents abrasions.
The buffer also prevents the optical fiber from scattering losses caused by microbends. Microbends occur
when an optical fiber is placed on a rough and distorted surface. Microbends are discussed later in this
chapter.
