Thanks to large unpopulated areas to jump over, 'stuff' jumps become possible. Also known as "zoo jumps", in these jumps the skydivers jump out with some object. Rubber raft jumps are popular; where the jumpers sit in a rubber raft. Cars, bicycles, motorcycles, vacuum cleaners, water tanks, and inflatable companions have also been thrown out the back of an aircraft. At a certain altitude, the jumpers break off from the object and deploy their parachutes, leaving it to smash into the ground at terminal velocity.
