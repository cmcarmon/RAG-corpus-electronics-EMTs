In physics, the Planck mass, denoted by mP, is the unit of mass in the system of natural units known as Planck units. It is approximately 0.02 milligrams (roughly the mass of a flea egg). For comparison, this value is of the order of 1015 (a quadrillion) times larger than the highest energy available to contemporary particle accelerators.
It is defined as:

ℏ

G



,


{\displaystyle m_{\text{P}}={\sqrt {\frac {\hbar c}{G}}},}

where c is the speed of light in a vacuum, G is the gravitational constant, and ħ is the reduced Planck constant.
Substituting values for the various components in this definition gives the approximate equivalent value of this unit in terms of other units of mass:

≈ 1.220910×1019 GeV/c2 = 2.176470(51)×10−8 kg = 21.76470 μg = 1.3107×1019 u.
Particle physicists and cosmologists often use an alternative normalization with the reduced Planck mass, which is
