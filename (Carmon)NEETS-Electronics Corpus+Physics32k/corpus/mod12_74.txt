Positive or negative voltage values can be used to plot the voltage-current graph. Figure 1-7 shows 
an example of this situation. First, the voltage versus current is plotted with the battery polarity as shown 
in view (A). Then the battery polarity is reversed and the remaining voltage versus current points are 
plotted. As a result, the line shown in view (C) is obtained.
