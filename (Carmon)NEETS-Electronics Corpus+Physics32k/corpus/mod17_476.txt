The first regular satellite communications service was used by the Navy in 1960. The moon was used 
to bounce teletypewriter signals between Hawaii and Washington, D.C. During the early 1960s, the Navy 
used the moon as a medium for passing messages between ships at sea and shore stations. This method of 
communications proved reliable when other methods failed.
