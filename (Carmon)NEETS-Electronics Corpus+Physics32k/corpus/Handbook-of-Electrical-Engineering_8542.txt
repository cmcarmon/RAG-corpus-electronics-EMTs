Therefore, microprogramming is simply an extra level in the general structure. Since it is used to deﬁne the
machine instruction set, it can be considered at the hardware level. Since this deﬁnition is done via a program
at  a  low  level,  but  still  eventually  modiﬁable,  it  can  also  be  considered  to  be  at  the  software  level.  For  these
reasons, the term ﬁrmware has been coined to name sets of microprograms. In short, microinstructions that
specify hardware functions (microoperations such as Open a path, Select operation) are used to form a more
complex  instruction  (Convert  to  binary,  Add  decimal).  The  machine  instruction  set  is  deﬁned  via  a  set  of
microprogram routines and a microprogrammed instruction decoder.
