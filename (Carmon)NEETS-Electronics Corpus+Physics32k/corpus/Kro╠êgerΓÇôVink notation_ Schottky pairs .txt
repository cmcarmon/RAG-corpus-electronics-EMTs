A Schottky defect is an intrinsic point defect that creates vacancies on both the cation and anion sublattices. This defect occurs in ionic crystals when one (positively charged) cation and one (negatively charged) anion leave the lattice simultaneously, resulting in two vacant lattice sites. Because the mass, site, and charge must remain balanced, these vacancies always occur in stoichiometric ratios. However, due to the loss of ions within the crystal lattice, these Schottky defects tend to lead to a decrease in the density of the material because vacancies have been created.
