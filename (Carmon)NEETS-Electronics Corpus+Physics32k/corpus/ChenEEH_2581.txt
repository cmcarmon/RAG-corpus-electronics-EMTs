In case of an NRD-guide resonator, the dielectric block may
be in the form of a rectangle made of a relatively low permit-
tivity and low-cost dielectric material. Thus, size is not a
problem. The intrinsic nonradiating condition of the NRD-
guide will give rise to a high Q value of the resonator since the
ﬁelds are well conﬁned inside the dielectric region and pose no
leakage problem. The NRD-guide resonator is also a promising
