Nematic liquid-crystal molecules typically incorporate two separated benzene rings in a complex chain molecule
[Wilson and Hawkes, 1989]. The organic chemistry of liquid-crystal compounds will lie outside the interests
of  most  readers  but  is  brieﬂy  reviewed  in “Liquid  Crystal  Materials  for  Display  Devices,”  by  J. A.  Castellano
and K. J. Harrison in The Physics and Chemistry of Liquid Crystal Devices, edited by G. J. Sprokel [Plenum, 1980].
One technique used in liquid-crystal color switches requires the use of electrically controlled birefringence.
