and is obtained by using a pole-zero cancellation at –a. In the modiﬁed system, x(n) is computed using x (n – 2)
as opposed to x (n – 1); thus we look ahead. The modiﬁed system has two delays in the multiply–add feedback
loop, and these two delays can be distributed to pipeline the multiply–add operation by two stages. Of course,
the additional multiply–add operation that represents one zero would also need to be pipelined by two stages
to keep up with the sample rate of the system. To increase the speed by four times, we can rewrite the transfer
function as:
