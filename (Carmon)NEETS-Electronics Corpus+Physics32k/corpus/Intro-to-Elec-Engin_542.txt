convenient way that is needed for the operations involved. Right-shifting registers are employed
in multiplication algorithms, whereas left-shifting registers are utilized in division algorithms.
Registers that are capable of shifting the data to the left or right are known as bidirectional
shift registers. The register along with additional gates on a single chip forms an IC component
known as the universal register, which usually includes the shift-left, shift-right, parallel-input,
and no-change operations.
