Pulse-position modulation (ppm), pulse-frequency modulation (pfm), and pulse-code modulation
(pcm) are most easily demodulated by first converting them to either pdm or pam. After conversion these
pulses are demodulated using either peak detection or a low-pass filter. This conversion may be done in
many ways, but your study will be limited to the simpler methods.
