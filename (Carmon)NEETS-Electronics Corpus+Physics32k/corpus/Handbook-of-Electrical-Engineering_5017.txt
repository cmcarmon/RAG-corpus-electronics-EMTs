Insulating Liquids
Insulating liquids are rarely used by themselves and are intended for use mainly as impregnants with cellulose
or synthetic papers. The 60-Hz breakdown strength of practical insulating liquids exceeds that of gases and for
a 1-cm gap separation it is of the order of about 100 kV cm–1. However, since the breakdown strength increases
with  decreasing  gap  length  and  as  the  oils  are  normally  evaluated  using  a  gap  separation  of  0.254  cm,  the
breakdown strengths normally cited range from approximately 138 to 240 kV cm–1. The breakdown values are
more  inﬂuenced  by  the  moisture  and  particle  contents  of  the  ﬂuids  than  by  their  molecular  structure  (cf.
Table 55.1).
