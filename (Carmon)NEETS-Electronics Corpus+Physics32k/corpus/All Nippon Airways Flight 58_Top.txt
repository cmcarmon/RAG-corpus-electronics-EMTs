All Nippon Airways (ANA) Flight 58 was a Japanese domestic flight from Sapporo to Tokyo, operated by All Nippon Airways (ANA). On 30 July 1971, at 2:04 local time, a Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) jet fighter collided with the Boeing 727 airliner operating the flight, causing both aircraft to crash. All 162 occupants of the flight were killed, while the Sabre pilot, a trainee with the JASDF, ejected before the collision and survived. This incident led to the resignation of the head Japan's Defense Agency and the JASDF chief of staff.
