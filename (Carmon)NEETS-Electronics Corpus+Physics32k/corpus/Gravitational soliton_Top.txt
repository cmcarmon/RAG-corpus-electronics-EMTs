A gravitational soliton is a soliton solution of the Einstein field equation. It can be separated into two kinds, a soliton of the vacuum Einstein equation generated by the Belinski-Zakharov transform, and a soliton of the Maxwell-Einstein equations generated by the Belinski-Zakharov-Alekseev transform.
