Since 2010 there has been renewed interest in bigravity after the development by Claudia de Rham, Gregory Gabadadze, and Andrew Tolley (dRGT) of a healthy theory of massive gravity. Massive gravity is a bimetric theory in the sense that nontrivial interaction terms for the metric




g

μ
ν




{\displaystyle g_{\mu \nu }}
can only be written down with the help of a second metric, as the only nonderivative term that can be written using one metric is a cosmological constant. In the dRGT theory, a nondynamical "reference metric"




f

μ
ν




{\displaystyle f_{\mu \nu }}
is introduced, and the interaction terms are built out of the matrix square root of




g

−
1


f


{\displaystyle g^{-1}f}
.
In dRGT massive gravity, the reference metric must be specified by hand. One can give the reference metric an Einstein-Hilbert term, in which case




f

μ
ν




{\displaystyle f_{\mu \nu }}
is not chosen but instead evolves dynamically in response to




g

μ
ν




{\displaystyle g_{\mu \nu }}
and possibly matter. This massive bigravity was introduced by Fawad Hassan and Rachel Rosen as an extension of dRGT massive gravity.
The dRGT theory is crucial to developing a theory with two dynamical metrics because general bimetric theories are plagued by the Boulware-Deser ghost, a possible sixth polarization for a massive graviton. The dRGT potential is constructed specifically to render this ghost nondynamical, and as long as the kinetic term for the second metric is of the Einstein-Hilbert form, the resulting theory remains ghost-free.
The action for the ghost-free massive bigravity is given by

As in standard general relativity, the metric




g

μ
ν




{\displaystyle g_{\mu \nu }}
has an Einstein-Hilbert kinetic term proportional to the Ricci scalar



R

{\displaystyle R(g)}
and a minimal coupling to the matter Lagrangian






L




m





{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}_{\mathrm {m} }}
, with




Φ

i




{\displaystyle \Phi _{i}}
representing all of the matter fields, such as those of the Standard Model. An Einstein-Hilbert term is also given for




f

μ
ν




{\displaystyle f_{\mu \nu }}
. Each metric has its own Planck mass,




M

g




{\displaystyle M_{g}}
and




M

f




{\displaystyle M_{f}}
. The interaction potential is the same as in dRGT massive gravity. The

are dimensionless coupling constants and



m


{\displaystyle m}
(or specifically




β

{\displaystyle \beta _{i}^{1/2}m}
) is related to the mass of the massive graviton. This theory propagates seven degrees of freedom, corresponding to a massless graviton and a massive graviton (although the massive and massless states do not align with either of the metrics).
The interaction potential is built out of the elementary symmetric polynomials
