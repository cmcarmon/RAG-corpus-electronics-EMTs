Semi-automatic transmissions have also made their way into the truck and bus market in the early 2000s. Volvo offers its I-Shift on its heavier trucks and buses, while ZF markets its ASTronic system for trucks, buses and coaches. In North America, Eaton offers the "AutoShift" system which is an add-on to traditional non-synchromesh manual transmissions for heavy trucks. These gearboxes have a place in public transport as they have been shown to reduce fuel consumption in some specific cases.
