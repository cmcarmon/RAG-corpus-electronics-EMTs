taps; this enables better control of the output voltage. Trans-
formers can be single-phase or three-phase, and three single-
phase transformers can sometimes be used instead of one
three-phase transformer. Although one three-phase trans-
former is cheaper than three one-phase transformers for the
same purpose, if a spare is needed for reliability purposes, two
three-phase transformers are more expensive than four one-
phase transformers!
