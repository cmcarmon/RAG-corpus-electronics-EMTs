13.3.2 A three-phase, wye-connected, 2300-V, four-
pole, 1000-kVA, 60-Hz synchronous machine
has a synchronous reactance Xs = 5 , a Ô¨Åeld re-
sistance Rf = 10 , and an approximately linear
magnetization characteristic (Ef versus If ) with
a slope Kag = 200 . The machine is connected
to a balanced three-phase ac system and is used
as a generator. Determine the following:
(a) The rated stator current.
(b) The exciter setting Vex = If Rf for operating
the machine at rated conditions, at a power
factor of (i) 0.866 lagging and (ii) 0.866
leading.
