Damage to eyes 
 
Molten  solder  or 
flux  additives  can  cause 
permanent  eye  damage.  Some  means  of  eye 
protection  is  essential.  This  can  take  the  form  of 
safety  glasses  or  the  use  of  a  bench  magnifier. 
Ordinary  reading  or  prescription  glasses  will  also 
offer  a  measure  of  protection  and  may  also  be  of 
benefit when undertaking close work.
