where Vb is the band velocity (in./min), Ti the time to increment the paper to the next print line position (min),
Pc the character pitch (in.), and Nc the number of characters in the character string. This relation assumes that
the  hammer  settle-out  time  is  less  than  the  paper  advance  time,  the  latter  normally  not  the  limiting  speed
factor. The usual limiting speed factor is related to print quality, i.e., well-registered, sharp-edged, high-optical-
density characters. In addition, because not all lines on a page are usually printed, with line skipping the actual
throughput may be signiÔ¨Åcantly faster than indicated above.
