A satellite in a circular orbit at other than 19,300 nautical miles above the earth is in a near-
synchronous orbit. If the orbit is lower than 19,300 nautical miles, the period of orbit of the satellite is 
less than the period of orbit of the earth. The satellite then appears to be moving slowly around the earth 
from west to east. (This type of orbit is also called subsynchronous.) If the orbit is higher than 19,300 
nautical miles, the period of orbit of the satellite is greater than the period of orbit of the earth. The 
satellite then appears to be moving slowly around the earth from east to west. Although inclined and polar 
near-synchronous orbits are possible, near synchronous implies an equatorial orbit.
