After the initial ﬁeld peak, the waveshapes of the vertical electric ﬁeld and the horizontal magnetic ﬁeld for
close lightning exhibit a valley followed by a hump in the case of the magnetic ﬁeld and by a ramp in the case
of the electric ﬁeld, as is evident from Figs. 40.19 through 40.22. Relative to the amplitude of the initial peak,
the hump and the ramp decrease with increasing distance of the return stroke. For distances of 25 km or greater,
the ramp in the electric ﬁeld is no longer signiﬁcant, and for distances of 50 km or more and for times of the
