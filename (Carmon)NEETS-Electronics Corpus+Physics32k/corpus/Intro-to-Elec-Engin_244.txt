(a) Find the Fourier series for the square wave shown in Figure E3.1.10(a).
(b) Let a voltage source having the waveform of part (a) with a peak value of 100 V and a
frequency of 10 Hz be applied to an RC series network with R = 20  and C = 0.1 F.
Determine the ﬁrst ﬁve nonzero terms of the Fourier series of vC(t).
