The Alsószentmihály inscription was deciphered by archaeologist Gábor Vékony.
The transcription of Vékony (it uses IPA symbols):
According to Vékony, the inscription was made by a Khavar leader, whose religion was Karaite. The first symbol of the first row is a ligature, its transcription: atlïɣ. The first symbol (from left) in the second row is a Khazarian word separator.
In the inscription, the third symbol of the first row (from left), and the symbol in the second and last place can be considered as the descendants of the Turkic ideograms. Nevertheless, their relation needs more evidence.
