The concept of light propagation, the transmission of light along an optical fiber, can be described by
two theories. According to the first theory, light is described as a simple ray. This theory is the ray theory,
or geometrical optics, approach. The advantage of the ray approach is that you get a clearer picture of the
propagation of light along a fiber. The ray theory is used to approximate the light acceptance and guiding
properties of optical fibers. According to the second theory, light is described as an electromagnetic wave.
This theory is the mode theory, or wave representation, approach. The mode theory describes the behavior
of light within an optical fiber. The mode theory is useful in describing the optical fiber properties of
absorption, attenuation, and dispersion. These fiber properties are discussed later in this chapter.
