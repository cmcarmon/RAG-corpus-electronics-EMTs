Many of the numbers that we have to deal with in 
electronics are extremely large whilst others can be 
extremely  small.  The  problem  of  coping  with  a 
wide  range  of  numbers  is  greatly  simplified  by 
using  logarithms.  Because  of  this,  we  frequently 
employ  logarithmic  scales,  Bels  (B)  and  decibels 
(dB),  when  comparing  values.  Note  that  a  decibel 
(dB) is simply one tenth of a Bel (B). Hence: 
 
10 dB = 1 B 
 
It is important to note that the Bel is derived from 
the logarithm of a ratio—it’s not a unit like the volt 
(V) or ampere (A). 
  The  logarithm  (to  the  base  10)  of  a  number  is 
defined  as  the  power  that  10  must  be  raised  to  in 
order  to  equal  that  number.  This  may  sound 
difficult but it isn’t, as a few examples will show: 
 
Because 10 = 101, the logarithm (to the base 10) of 
10 is 1. 
 
Because 100 = 102, the logarithm (to the base 10) 
of 100 is 2. 
 
Because 1,000 = 103, the logarithm (to the base 10) 
of 1,000 is 3, and so on. 
 
Writing this as a formula we can say that: 
 
If  x = 10n, the logarithm (to the base 10) of x is n.
