Transparency
This  is  a  fundamental  principle  of  software  engineering  that  simply  means  that  there  should  be  no  hidden
processing or reliance on side effects on which the package depends for its correct operation. Everything the
package does and the package itself should, at all times, be under the complete control of the user.
