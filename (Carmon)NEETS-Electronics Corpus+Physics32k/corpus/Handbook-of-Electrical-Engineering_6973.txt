The Cardinal Series
If  a  signal  has  ﬁnite  energy,  the  minimum sampling rate  is  equal  to  two  samples  per  period  of  the  highest
frequency component of the signal. Speciﬁcally, if the highest frequency component of the signal is B Hz, then
the signal, x(t), can be recovered from the samples by
