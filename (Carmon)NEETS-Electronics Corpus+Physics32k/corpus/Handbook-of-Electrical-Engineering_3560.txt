Rules checking veriﬁes that the ﬁnal layout of geometric shapes and their orientation complies with logical,
electrical,  and  physical  constraints.  Logical  rules  verify  that  the  implementation  realizes  the  desired  digital
system. Electrical rules verify conformance to loading, noise margins, and fan-in/fan-out connectivity constraints.
Finally, physical rules verify conformance to dimensional, spacing, and alignment constraints [Hollis, 1987].
