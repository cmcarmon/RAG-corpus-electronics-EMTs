Example 3.3.  Figure 3.16 displays an oriented graph of a particular network in which there are six branches
labeled  with  numbers  within  parentheses  and  four  nodes  labeled  by  numbers  within  circles.  Several  known
branch currents and branch voltages are indicated. Because the type of elements or their values is not germane
to the construction of the graph, the other branch currents and branch voltages may be evaluated from repeated
applications of KCL and KVL. KCL may be used Ô¨Årst at the various nodes.
