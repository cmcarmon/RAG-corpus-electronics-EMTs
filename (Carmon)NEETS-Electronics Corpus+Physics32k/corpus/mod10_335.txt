27-DAY SUNSPOT CYCLE.â€”The number  of sunspots in existence at any one time is continually 
subject to change as some disappear and new ones emerge. As the sun rotates on its own axis, these 
sunspots are visible at 27-day intervals, the approximate period required for the sun to make one complete 
rotation.
