When RL > Z0 (RL < Z0), a voltage maximum (minimum)
occurs at the load position.
Figure 4.10 displays the magnitude of the voltage and cur-
rent for a terminated transmission line with Vg Â¼ 10ï¬€45V ,
Z0 Â¼ 50V, Zg Â¼ 75V, ZL Â¼ 100V, and â€˜ Â¼ l. The voltage
and current magnitudes replicate every half wavelength. The
