Although we generally consider a cell or battery in a circuit to be a perfect source of voltage
(absolutely constant), the current through it dictated solely by the external resistance of the
circuit to which it is attached, this is not entirely true in real life. Since every cell or battery
contains some internal resistance, that resistance must affect the current in any given circuit:
