This list includes distances between 1 and 10 exametres (1018 m). To help compare different distances this section lists lengths between 1018 m (1 Em or 105.7 light years) and 1019 m (1057 light years).
1.2 Em – 129 light years – Diameter of Messier 13 (a typical globular cluster)
1.6 Em – 172 ± 12.5 light years – Diameter of Omega Centauri (one of the largest known globular clusters, perhaps containing over a million stars)
3.1 Em – 310 light years – Distance to Canopus according to Hipparcos
5.7 Em – 600 light years – Diameter of the Tarantula Nebula
6.1 Em – 640 light years – Distance to Betelgeuse according to Hipparcos
6.2 Em – 650 light years – Distance to the Helix Nebula, located in the constellation Aquarius
7.3 Em – 730 light years – Distance to Rigel according to Hipparcos
