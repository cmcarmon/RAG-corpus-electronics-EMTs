made it possible to reduce the size of electronic 
circuits because of their small size and low power 
consumption. It is now possible to extend the prin-
ciples behind semiconductors to complete circuits as 
well as individual components. The goal of the inte-
grated circuit is to develop a single device to perform 
a specific function, such as amplification or switching, 
thus eliminating the separation between components 
and circuits.
