Orbits are conic sections, so the formula for the distance of a body for a given angle corresponds to the formula for that curve in polar coordinates, which is:




r
=


p

1
+
e
cos
⁡
θ





{\displaystyle r={\frac {p}{1+e\cos \theta }}}





μ
=
G
(

m

1


+

m

)



{\displaystyle \mu =G(m_{1}+m_{2})\,}





p
=

h

2



/

μ



{\displaystyle p=h^{2}/\mu \,}





μ


{\displaystyle \mu }
is called the gravitational parameter.




m

1




{\displaystyle m_{1}}
and




m

2




{\displaystyle m_{2}}
are the masses of objects 1 and 2, and



h


{\displaystyle h}
is the specific angular momentum of object 2 with respect to object 1. The parameter



θ


{\displaystyle \theta }
is known as the true anomaly,



p


{\displaystyle p}
is the semi-latus rectum, while



e


{\displaystyle e}
is the orbital eccentricity, all obtainable from the various forms of the six independent orbital elements.
