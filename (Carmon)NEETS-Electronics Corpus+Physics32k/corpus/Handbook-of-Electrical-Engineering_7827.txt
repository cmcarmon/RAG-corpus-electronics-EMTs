signal  DS  equal  to  zero.  If  the  disk  now  moves  away  from  the  objective,  the  returning  beam  will  become
converging, as in Fig. 80.27(b), sending all the light to detector #1. In this case DS will be positive and the voice
coil will push the lens towards the disk. On the other hand, when the disk moves close to the objective, the
returning beam becomes diverging and detector #2 receives the light [see Fig. 80.27(c)]. This results in a negative
DS that forces the voice coil to pull back in order to return DS to zero. A given focus error detection scheme
is generally characterized by the shape of its focus error signalDS versus the amount of defocus Dz; one such
curve is shown in Fig. 80.27(d). The slope of the focus error signal (FES) curve near the origin is of particular
importance, since it determines the overall performance and stability of the servo loop.
