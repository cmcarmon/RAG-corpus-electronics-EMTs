Example 6.1 
 
A mains transformer having a turns ratio of 44:1 is 
connected  to  a  220  V  r.m.s.  mains  supply.  If  the 
secondary output is applied to a half-wave rectifier, 
determine the peak voltage that will appear across a 
load. 
 
Solution 
 
The r.m.s. secondary voltage will be given by: 
 
VS = VP / 11 = 220 / 44 = 5 V
The peak voltage developed after rectification will 
be given by: 
 
VPK = 1.414 Ã— 5 V = 7.07 V 
 
Assuming that the diode is a silicon device with a 
forward  voltage  drop  of  0.6  V,  the  actual  peak 
voltage dropped across the load will be: 
 
VL = 7.07 V B 0.6 V = 6.47 V
