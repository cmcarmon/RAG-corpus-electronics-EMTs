Astable pulse generator 
 
Figure  12.7  shows  how  the  standard  555  can  be 
used  as  an  astable  pulse  generator. In  order  to 
understand  how  this  circuit  operates,  assume  that 
the output (pin-3) is initially high and that TR1 is in 
the  non-conducting  state.  The  capacitor,  C, will 
begin to charge with current supplied by means of 
series resistors, R1 and R2.
