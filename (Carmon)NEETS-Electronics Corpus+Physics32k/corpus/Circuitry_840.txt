to 0 V at regular points. This promotes stability 
 
by  ensuring  that  the  0  V  rail  is  effective  as  a 
 
 
common rail. 
12. Minimize,  as  far  as  possible,  the  number  of 
links  required.  These  should  be  made  on  (he 
 
upper (component) side of the stripboard. Only 
 
 
in exceptional cases should links be made on the 
 
underside (foil side) of the board. 
13. Experiment  with  positioning  of 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When  the  stripboard  layout  is  complete,  it  is 
important  to  carefully  check  it  against  the  circuit 
diagram.  Not  only  can  this  save  considerable 
frustration at a later stage but it can be instrumental 
in  preventing  some  costly  mistakes.  In  particular, 
one should follow the positive supply and 0 V (or 
‘ground’) strips and check that all chips and other 
devices have supplies. The technique employed by 
the author involves the use of coloured pencils that 
are used to trace the circuit and stripboard layout; 
associating each line in the circuit diagram  with a 
physical interconnection on the stripboard. Colours 
are used as follows:
