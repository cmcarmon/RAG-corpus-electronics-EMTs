During operation of a welding process, soften or molten portion of thermoplastics (polymer articles) is able to flow through the interface. Smaller amount of flow causes smaller diffusion at the interface and lower weld strength. In order for a polymer melt to flow, macromolecular chain segments must be able to move. When the chain segments obtain sufficient thermal energy to overcome energy barrier, they can move readily. The energy barrier is called as activation energy (Ea). It can be said that if a polymer’s absolute value of activation energy (|Ea|) is lower, its weldability becomes better.
|Ea| values of such polymers as PVC decrease with increasing shear rate (

), implying better weldability where shear rate (movement) are higher within all cross-section of welding region.
Using viscosity-shear rate (

where
η is viscosity of molten polymer,
C is pre-exponential factor,
R is universal gas constant,
T is absolute temperature.
How to calculate absolute value of activation energy (|Ea|) by taking the natural logarithm of Arrhenius equation can be readily learned elsewhere (see Arrhenius equation).
