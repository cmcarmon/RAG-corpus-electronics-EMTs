Crocodile	clips	are	devices	that	can	be	used	for	the	assembly	of	a	circuit;	these	tools	are
so-named	for	their	resemblance	to	the	jaws	of	a	crocodile.	With	them,	a	solid	grip	to
connect	a	component	is	possible.	If	you’re	wondering	how	electrical	engineers	can	create
electrical	connections	without	the	associated	dangers?	Well,	there’s	your	answer.
By	using	crocodile	clips,	you	can	make	a	model	of	a	working	circuit.	Whether	be	it	a	basic
circuit,	a	series	circuit,	or	a	parallel	circuit,	you	can	create	for	an	audience	to	analyze.
