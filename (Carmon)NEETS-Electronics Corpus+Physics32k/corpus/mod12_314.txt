 C, the phase difference approaches 90 degrees. The circuit is now almost completely capacitive. By
replacing the resistor with a vacuum tube, as shown in view (A) of figure 2-24, we can vary the resistance
(vacuum-tube impedance) by varying the voltage applied to the grid of the tube. The frequency applied to
the circuit (from a crystal-controlled master oscillator) will be shifted in phase by 45 degrees with no
audio input [view (B)]. With the application of an audio signal, the phase will shift as the impedance of
the tube is varied.
