The charge of one electron might be used as a unit of electrical charge, since charges are created by
displacement of electrons; but the charge of one electron is so small that it is impractical to use. The
practical unit adopted for measuring charges is the COULOMB, named after the scientist Charles
Coulomb. One coulomb is equal to the charge of 6,280,000,000,000,000,000 (six quintillion two hundred
and eighty quadrillion) or (6.28 x 1018 ) electrons.
