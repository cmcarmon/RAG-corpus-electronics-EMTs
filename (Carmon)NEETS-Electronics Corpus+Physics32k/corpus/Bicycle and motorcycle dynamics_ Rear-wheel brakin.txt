The rear brake of an upright bicycle can only produce about 0.25 g (~2.5 m/s2) deceleration at best, because of the decrease in normal force at the rear wheel as described above. All such bikes with only rear braking are subject to this limitation: for example, bikes with only a coaster brake, and fixed-gear bikes with no other braking mechanism. There are, however, situations that may warrant rear wheel braking
Slippery surfaces or bumpy surfaces. Under front wheel braking, the lower coefficient of friction may cause the front wheel to skid which often results in a loss of balance.
Front flat tire. Braking a wheel with a flat tire can cause the tire to come off the rim which greatly reduces friction and, in the case of a front wheel, result in a loss of balance.
Front brake failure.
Recumbent bicycles. Long-wheelbase recumbents require a good rear brake as the CG is near the rear wheel.
