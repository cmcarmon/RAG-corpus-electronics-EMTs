The universal motor is conﬁgured like a series dc motor. In
fact, the universal motor can be run from a dc or ac supply. If
the motor is connected to an ac supply, the armature current
and the ﬁeld ﬂux change direction at the same time, and the
torque is always in the same direction. The universal motor
typically has a laminated rotor and stator core due to the ac
operation. These motors are useful for high-speed, low-torque
operations.
