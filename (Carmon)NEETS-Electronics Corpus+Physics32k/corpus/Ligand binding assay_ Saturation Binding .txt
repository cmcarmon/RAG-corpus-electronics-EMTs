Saturation analysis is used in various types of tissues, such as fractions of partially purified plasma from tissue homogenates, cells transfected with cloned receptors, and cells that are either in culture or isolated prior to analysis. Saturation binding analysis can determine receptor affinity and density. It requires that the concentration chosen must be determined empirically for a new ligand.
There are two common strategies that are adopted for this type of experiment: Increasing the amount of radioligand added while maintaining both the constant specific activity and constant concentration of radioligand, or decreasing the specific activity of the radioligand due to the addition of an unlabeled ligand.
