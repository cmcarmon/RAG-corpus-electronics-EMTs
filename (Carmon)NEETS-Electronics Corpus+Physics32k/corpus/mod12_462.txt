Assume that the voltages developed above resonance are such that the higher voltage on the cathode
of CR1 causes C3 to charge to 8 volts. The lower voltage on the anode of CR2 causes C4 to charge to 2
volts. Capacitor C5 remains charged to the sum of these two voltages, 10 volts. Again, by adding the
voltages in loop ACB or ADB between points A and B, you can find the output voltage. Point A to point
D equals -2 volts. Point D to point B equals +5 volts. Their algebraic sum, and the output, equals +3 volts
when tuned above resonance. During the negative half cycle of the input signal, the diodes are reverse
biased and C5 helps maintain a constant output.
