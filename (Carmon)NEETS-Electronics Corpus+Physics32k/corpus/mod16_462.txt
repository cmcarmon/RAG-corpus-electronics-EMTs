For explanation purposes, letâ€™s assume you wish to measure 30 volts dc. In this case, select the next
higher range position, 50V. When you place the range switch to the 50V position (as shown in view B of
figure 4-4), the meter pointer should rise from a little more than midscale to 30, which represents 30 volts
dc.
