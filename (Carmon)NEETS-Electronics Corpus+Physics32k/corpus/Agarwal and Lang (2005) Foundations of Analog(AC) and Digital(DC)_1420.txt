signal transition times between inputs and outputs of circuits. The rise and fall
times are defined as follows:7
Rise Time In general, the rise time for an output is defined as the delay in rising
from its lowest value to a valid high (VOH) at that output.
Fall Time The fall time for an output is defined as the delay in falling from its
highest value to a valid low (VOL) at the same output.
In general, the propagation delay and the rise/fall time are not equal. The
0 â†’ 1 propagation delay for a digital circuit is the time between an input 0 to
1 transition (the input transition is assumed to happen instantaneously) and the
corresponding output transition. The output transition is assumed to complete
only when the output voltage crosses the appropriate output voltage threshold.
The propagation delay and the rise/fall times are usually not equal when the
digital circuit consists of multiple stages. When a circuit consists of multiple
stages, the rise/fall time at the output is usually a function of the properties
of the output circuit alone. However, the propagation delay is the sum of the
delays of each of the stages.
