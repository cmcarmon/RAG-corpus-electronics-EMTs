Microcontrollers are designed for machine-control 
applications and do not require human interaction to 
operate. For example, toasters and microwave ovens 
have one or two fixed, repetitive programs. A micro-
controller does not require any human interface de-
vice such as a keyboard, monitor, or mouse.
