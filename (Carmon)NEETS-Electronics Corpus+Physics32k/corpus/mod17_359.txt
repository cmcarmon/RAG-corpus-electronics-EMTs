NEUTRAL.â€”Neutral circuits make use of the presence or absence of current flow to convey 
information. A neutral teletypewriter circuit is composed of a transmitting device, a battery source to 
supply current, a variable resistor to control the amount of current, a receiving device, and a line for the 
transmission medium.
