Applying the motion vectors to an image to synthesize the transformation to the next image is called motion compensation. As a way of exploiting temporal redundancy, motion estimation and compensation are key parts of video compression. Almost all video coding standards use block-based motion estimation and compensation such as the MPEG series including the most recent HEVC.
