In  the  absence  of  piezoelectric  coupling,  the  active  region  could  be  represented  by  a  one-dimensional
transmission  line  as  discussed  in  the  previous  section  and  as  indicated  by  the  heavy  lines  in  Fig. 48.3. With
piezoelectricity there will be the stiffening of the appropriate stiffness constants as discussed in Eq. (48.9) with
the concomitant perturbation of the characteristic impedance Z0p and the phase velocity Vp, but more important
there will also be coupling to the electrical port. One model including the latter coupling is shown in Fig. 48.3
in which the parameters are deÔ¨Åned by
