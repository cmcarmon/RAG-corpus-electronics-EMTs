In essence, the estimate that minimizes the MSE is the condi-
tional-mean estimate. If the a posteriori distribution is Gauss-
ian, then the conditional-mean estimator is a linear function of
X, regardless of the functional relation between S and X. The
following theorem summarizes a very familiar result.
