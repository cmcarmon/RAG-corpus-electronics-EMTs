An ideal electrorheological ﬂuid is one that has a low viscosity in the absence of an applied ﬁeld and that
which  transforms  into  a  high-viscosity  gel  capable  of  withstanding  high  shear  stresses  when  the  ﬁeld  is  on.
Further, it must also have a low power consumption. The ﬁrst reported ER ﬂuid consisted of ﬁnely dispersed
suspensions of starch or silica gel in mineral oil nearly 40 years ago.
