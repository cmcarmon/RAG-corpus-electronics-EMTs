As discussed in Taﬂove and Hagness (2000), there are pro-
posed means to improve the accuracy of FDTD algorithms to
allow much larger structures to be modeled. Speciﬁcally, using
pseudo-spectral techniques (Y. Liu, 1996, 1997), D~vvaniso can be
reduced to very low levels approaching zero. In this case,
