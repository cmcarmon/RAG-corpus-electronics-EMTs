 
where Eind is the induced emf in volts; L is the inductance in henrys; and ∆I is the change in current in 
amperes occurring in ∆t seconds. The symbol ∆ (Greek letter delta), means "a change in ....". The henry is 
a large unit of inductance and is used with relatively large inductors. With small inductors, the millihenry 
is used. (A millihenry is equal to 1 × 10-3 henry, and one henry is equal to 1,000 millihenrys.) For still 
smaller inductors the unit of inductance is the microhenry (µH). (A µH = 1 × 10 -6H, and one henry is 
equal to 1,000,000 microhenrys.)
