age, current, resistance, or something else) and, on some models, the 
range setting you want to use. Some multimeters are more “multi” than 
others, and include one or more of the following categories: AC amperes, 
 capacitance, transistor gain (hFE), and diode test. Many multimeters 
further divide some measurement categories into three to six different 
ranges; the smaller the range, the greater the sensitivity of the reading.
