The movable coil is wrapped around the aluminum frame of the galvanometer. The coil is suspended
between the poles of the magnet by means of thin, flat ribbons of phosphor bronze. These ribbons provide
a conduction path for the current between the circuit being tested and the movable coil. The ribbons allow
the coil to twist in response to the interaction of the applied current through the coil and the magnetic
field of the permanent magnet. They also provide the restoring force for the coil. Basically, the restoring
force is that force necessary to return the movable frame to its resting position after a reading. The
ribbons restrain or provide a counterforce to the magnetic force acting on the coil. When the driving force
of the coil current is removed, the restoring force provided by the ribbons returns the coil to its zero
position.
