Many materials undergo inelastic deformations caused by plasticity and damage. These material behaviors cannot be described in terms of a potential. It is also often the case that no memory of the initial virgin state exists, particularly when large deformations are involved. The constitutive relation is typically defined in incremental form in such cases to make the computation of stresses and deformations easier.
