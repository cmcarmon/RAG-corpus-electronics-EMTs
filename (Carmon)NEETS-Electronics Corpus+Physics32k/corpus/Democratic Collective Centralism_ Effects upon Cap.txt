Democratic Collective Centralism supports free market of all private organizations with one simple guideline. As long as the private organization is not intentionally damaging the country's or state's health for profit reasons, they're freely allowed to carry out all forms of legal business upon the public. However, if the private organization is found to be unintentionally damaging the country's or state's health when there is an option not to damage the country's or state's health; the government will step in and force that switch. All of this falls under collectivism because when the government acts, there reasoning will be for benefiting the country or state.
