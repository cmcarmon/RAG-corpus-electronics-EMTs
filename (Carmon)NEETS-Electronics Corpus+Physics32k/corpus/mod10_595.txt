Figure 4-4 shows the current and voltage distribution on a half-wave (Hertz) antenna. In view A, a 
piece of wire is cut in half and attached to the terminals of a high-frequency ac generator. The frequency 
of the generator is set so that each half of the wire is 1/4 wavelength of the output. The result is a common 
type of antenna known as a DIPOLE.
