Paranormal abilities like the Force are a common device in science fiction, and the Force has been compared to the role magic plays in the fantasy genre. The Star Wars films illustrate that characters not familiar with the particulars of the Force associate it with mysticism and magic, such as when an Imperial officer alludes to Darth Vader's "sorcerer's ways". Christina Flotmann distinguishes between the depiction of the Force in the Star Wars franchise and the depiction of magic in the Harry Potter fantasy series, and she describes the Force as a spiritual energy.
Eric Charles points out that the television films Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure (1984) and Ewoks: The Battle for Endor (1985), intended for children, are "fairy tales in a science fiction setting". These films feature magic and other fairy tale motifs rather than the Force and science fiction tropes. Mark Clark said the Ewok Adventure films depict "sorcery" that is completely different from the Force powers depicted in the original and prequel Star Wars films.
