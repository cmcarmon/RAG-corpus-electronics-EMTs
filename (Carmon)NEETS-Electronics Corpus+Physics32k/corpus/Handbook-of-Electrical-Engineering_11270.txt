Figure  115.8  shows  a  three-channel  ECG  ampliﬁer  schematic  used  in  a  high-resolution  ECG  system.  The
patient is dc coupled to the front end differential, instrumentation ampliﬁer. The ﬁrst stage of gain is relatively
low  (»100)  because  there  can  be  a  signiﬁcant  signal  drift  due  to  a  high  static  charge  on  the  body  or  low-
frequency  offset  potentials  generated  by  the  electrolyte  in  the  tissue/electrode  interface.  In  this  particular
ampliﬁer the signal is bandpass ﬁltered prior to the isolation stage. To further limit the high ﬂoating potential
of the patient and to improve the system common mode rejection a driven ground is usually used. This ground
is simply an average of the limb potentials inverted by a single ampliﬁer and connected to the right leg.
