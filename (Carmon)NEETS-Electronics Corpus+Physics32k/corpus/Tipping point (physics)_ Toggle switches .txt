The switch mechanism is designed to have two stable states that are a mirror image of each other, with the contact actuator always resting at one stable state or the other. Movement of the switch control lever applies tension to a spring, until the control lever crosses the tipping or equilibrium point of the contact actuator. The spring then pushes the actuator to the opposite state, releasing the spring tension.
There are several advantages to the tipping point mechanism in comparison to old-fashioned direct-operated knife switches:
The speed at which the control lever is operated does not affect the speed at which the spring releases its tension. Moving the control quickly or slowly simply compresses the spring, and the actuator does not move until the tipping point is crossed.
The tipping point design prevents damage to the contacts due to the switch being opened slowly, resulting in arc formation, or the switch contacts not being closed completely and firmly.
The tipping point also provides some protection against physical impacts that could cause the actuator to open, since the tipping point spring applies steady pressure across the contacts.
However large springs and levers can produce a loud clunking noise as they suddenly release. In homes this noise is undesirable, resulting in the development of much simpler tipping point mechanisms of low mass, using leaf springs and a very small strip of metal as the contact actuator.
