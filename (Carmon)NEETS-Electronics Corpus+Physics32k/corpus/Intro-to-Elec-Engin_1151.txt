Since the power input in a single-phase circuit pulsates at twice the line frequency, all single-
phase motors have a double-frequency torque component, which causes slight oscillations in rotor
speed and imparts vibration to the motor supports. The design must provide a means to prevent
this vibration from causing objectionable noise.
