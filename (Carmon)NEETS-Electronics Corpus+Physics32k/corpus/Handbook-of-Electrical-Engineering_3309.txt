Detectors for Fiber Optic Communications
A major application for junction photodioldes is detectors for ﬁber optic communications. Silicon detectors
are typically used for short wavelength light such as with GaAs sources. InP detectors are used for the 1.3 and
1.5 mm wavelength bands. The speciﬁc type and design of a detector is tailored to the ﬁber optics application,
depending on whether it is low cost lower frequency datalinks or higher cost high frequency bit-rates in the
