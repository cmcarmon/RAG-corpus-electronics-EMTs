Transformers function by the linkage of magnetic ﬂux
through a core of ferromagnetic material. Figure 7.1(A) illus-
trates a magnetic core with a single winding. When a current I
is supplied to the ﬁrst set of windings, called the primary
windings, a magnetic ﬁeld, H, will develop, and magnetic
ﬂux, f, will ﬂow in the core. Ampe`re’s law relates the enclosed
current to the magnetic ﬁeld encountered on a closed path. If
H is constant throughout the path, then:
