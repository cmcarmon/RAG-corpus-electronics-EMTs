SQUIRREL-CAGE WINDINGSâ€”A type of rotor winding in which heavy conductors are imbedded in
the rotor body. The conductors are shorted together at the ends by continuous rings. No insulation is
required between the windings and the core. This type of winding is rugged, easily manufactured,
and practically maintenance free. It is widely applied in ac induction motors. Physically, it appears as
a rotating squirrel-cage, thus the name.
