The above equations can also be written using quantities related to the number of nuclide particles N in a sample;
The activity: A = λN.
The amount of substance: n = N/L.
The mass: M = Arn = ArN/L.
where L = 6.022×1023 is Avogadro's constant, Ar is the relative atomic mass number, and the amount of the substance is in moles.
