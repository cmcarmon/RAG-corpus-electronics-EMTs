For hand calculations, neglect series resistance is usually neglected (this approximation will not be necessary
for a computer solution). Also, the only difference in the positive and negative sequence networks is introduced
by the machine impedances. If we select the subtransient reactance Xd¢¢ for the positive sequence reactance, the
difference  is  slight  (in  fact,  the  two  are  identical  for  nonsalient  machines).  The  simpliﬁcation  is  important,
since it reduces computer storage requirements by roughly one-third. Circuit models for generators, lines, and
transformers are shown in Figs. 61.30, 61.31, and 61.32, respectively.
