Since a silicon diode will pass current in only one direction, it is ideally suited for converting 
alternating current (ac) to direct current (dc). When ac voltage is applied to a diode, the diode conducts 
ONLY ON THE POSITIVE ALTERNATION OF VOLTAGE; that is, when the anode of the diode is 
positive with respect to the cathode. This simplest type of rectifier is the half-wave rectifier. As shown in 
view A of figure 4-3, the half-wave rectifier uses only one diode. During the positive alternation of input 
voltage, the sine wave applied to the diode makes the anode positive with respect to the cathode. The 
diode then conducts, and current (I) flows from the negative supply lead (the secondary of the 
transformer), through the milliammeter, through the diode, and to the positive supply lead. As indicated 
by the shaded area of the output waveform in view B, this current exists during the entire period of time 
that the anode is positive with respect to the cathode (in other words, for the first 180 degrees of the input 
sine wave).
