Now,  since  there  are  360째  in  one  complete 
revolution  we  can  deduce  that  one  radian  is  the 
same  as  360째/2a = 57.3째.  On  other  words,  to 
convert: 
 
(a)   degrees to radians multiply by 57.3 
(b)   radians to degrees divide by 57.3 
 
It is important to note that one complete cycle of a 
periodic  function  (i.e.  a  waveform)  occurs  in  a 
time, T. This is known as the periodic time or just 
the period. In a time interval equal to T, the angle 
will  have  changed  by  360째.  The  relationship 
between  time  and  angle  expressed  in  degrees  is 
thus:
