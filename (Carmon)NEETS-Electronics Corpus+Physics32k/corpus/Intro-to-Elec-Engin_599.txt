The Internet is physically a collection of packet switching networks interconnected by
gateways along with protocols that allow them to function logically as a single, large, virtual
network. Gateways (often called IP routers) route packets to other gateways until they can
be delivered to the Ô¨Ånal destination directly across one physical network. Figure 6.4.3 shows
the structure of physical networks and gateways that provide interconnection. Gateways do not
provide direct connections among all pairs of networks. The TCP/IP is designated to provide a
universal interconnection among machines, independent of the particular network to which they
are attached. Besides gateways that interconnect physical networks, as shown in Figure 6.4.3,
Internet access software is needed on each host (any end-user computer system that connects to
a network) to allow application programs to use the Internet as if it were a single, real physical
network. Hosts may range in size from personal computers to supercomputers.
