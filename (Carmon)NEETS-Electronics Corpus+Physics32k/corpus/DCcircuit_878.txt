The voltage produced by thermocouple junctions is strictly dependent upon temperature.
Any current in a thermocouple circuit is a function of circuit resistance in opposition to this
voltage (I=E/R). In other words, the relationship between temperature and Seebeck voltage is
Ô¨Åxed, while the relationship between temperature and current is variable, depending on the
