NEGATIVE-RESISTANCE MAGNETRON.â€”The split-anode, negative-resistance magnetron is 
a variation of the basic magnetron which operates at a higher frequency. The negative-resistance 
magnetron is capable of greater power output than the basic magnetron. Its general construction is similar 
to the basic magnetron except that it has a split plate, as shown in figure 2-23A and B. These half plates 
are operated at different potentials to provide an electron motion, as shown in figure 2-24. The electron 
leaving the cathode and progressing toward the high-potential plate is deflected by the magnetic field and 
follows the path shown in figure 2-24. After passing the split between the two plates, the electron enters 
the electrostatic field set up by the lower-potential plate.
