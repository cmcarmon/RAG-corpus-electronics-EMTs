which is an important result as a solution of Equation (3.2.3). Then we can easily write the solution
),
of Equation (3.2.2) corresponding to the RL circuit of Figure 3.2.1, and that will involve i(0
which is the same as iL(0
), which is the value of the inductor current immediately after the
switch is closed.
