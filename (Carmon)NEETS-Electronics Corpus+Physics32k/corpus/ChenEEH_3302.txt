Typically, every generator in the system consists of two types
of internal controls, one for maintaining the real power output
of the generator and the other for regulating the bus voltage
magnitude. In power ﬂow studies, we usually assume that both
these control mechanisms are operating perfectly and so the
real power output PGi and Vi are maintained at their speciﬁed
values. Again, the load variables PLi and QLi are also assumed
to be known. This leaves the generator reactive output QGi and
the voltage phase angle di as the two unknown variables for the
bus. In terms of injections, the real power injection Pi and the
bus voltage Vi are then the speciﬁed variables; thus, the gener-
ator busses are normally denoted PV busses in power ﬂow
studies.
