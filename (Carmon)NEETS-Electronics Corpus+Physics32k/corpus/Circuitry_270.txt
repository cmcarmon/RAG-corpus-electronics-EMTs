successful  operation  with  a  variety  of  different 
devices. JFET parameters are shown in Table 5.11. 
  The 
common  
N-channel  field  effect  transistors  are  shown  in 
Table  5.12.  Figure  5.31  shows  a  test  circuit  for 
obtaining  the  characteristics  of  an  N-channel  FET 
(the arrangement for a P-channel FET is similar but 
all meters and supplies must be reversed). A typical 
N-channel JFET data sheet is shown in Fig. 5.32. 
 
Example 5.8 
A FET operates with a drain current of 50 mA and 
a gate-source bias of V2 V. If the device has a gfs of
