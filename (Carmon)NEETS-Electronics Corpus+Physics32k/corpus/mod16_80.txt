When test equipment is sent for calibration and repair, all accessories, such as probes, adapters, and
calibration sheets, should be included. Only in emergencies or special situations should partial repair or
calibration be attempted on test equipment designated as nonrepairable. Such emergency repairs should
be noted on a tag attached to the unit and an entry made on the MEASURE card (discussed shortly). The
equipment should then be sent at the earliest opportunity to an authorized facility so that permanent
repairs can be made and the unit calibrated.
