Under standard assumptions the orbital period (



T




{\displaystyle T\,\!}
) of a body traveling along an elliptic orbit can be computed as:




T
=
2
π




a

3



μ






{\displaystyle T=2\pi {\sqrt {a^{3} \over {\mu }}}}

where:




μ



{\displaystyle \mu \,}
is the standard gravitational parameter,




a




{\displaystyle a\,\!}
is the length of the semi-major axis.
Conclusions:
The orbital period is equal to that for a circular orbit with the orbital radius equal to the semi-major axis (



a




{\displaystyle a\,\!}
),
For a given semi-major axis the orbital period does not depend on the eccentricity (See also: Kepler's third law).
