In military communications receivers you may sacrifice fidelity to improve selectivity. This is
permitted because intelligence (voice, teletypewriter) can be carried on a fairly narrow band of
frequencies. Entertainment receivers, on the other hand, must reproduce a wider band of frequencies to
achieve their high-fidelity objective.
