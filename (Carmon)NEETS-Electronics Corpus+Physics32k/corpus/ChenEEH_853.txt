Many different fully synchronous digital systems exist. It is
virtually impossible to describe the variety of all past, current,
or future such systems depending on the circuit manufacturing
technology, design style, performance requirements, and mul-
tiple other factors. A system model of these fully synchronous
digital systems is required so that the system properties can be
fully understood and analyzed from the perspective of clock
skew scheduling and clock tree synthesis while permitting
unnecessary details to be abstracted.3
