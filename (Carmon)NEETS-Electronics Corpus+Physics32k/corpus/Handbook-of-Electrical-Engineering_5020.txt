Alkyl benzenes are used as impregnants in high-voltage cables, often as substitutes of the low-viscosity mineral
oils in self-contained oil-Ô¨Ålled cables. They consist of alkyl chains attached to a benzene ring having the general
formula C6H5(CH2)nCH3; however, branched alkyl benzenes are also employed. Their electrical properties are
comparable to those of mineral oils, and they exhibit good gas inhibition characteristics. Due to their detergent
character, alkyl benzenes tend to be more susceptible to contamination than mineral oils.
