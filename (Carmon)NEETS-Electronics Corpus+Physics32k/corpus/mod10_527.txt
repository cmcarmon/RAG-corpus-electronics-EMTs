At the points of voltage maxima and minima on a short-circuited or open-circuited line, the line
impedance is resistive. On a short-circuited line, each point at an odd number of quarter-wavelengths
from the receiving end has a high impedance (figure 3-31, view A). If the frequency of the applied
voltage to the line is varied, this impedance decreases as the effective length of the line changes. This
variation is exactly the same as the change in the impedance of a parallel-resonant circuit when the
applied frequency is varied.
