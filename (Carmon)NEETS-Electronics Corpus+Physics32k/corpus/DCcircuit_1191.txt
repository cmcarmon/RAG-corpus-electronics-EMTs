On the other end of the fuse action spectrum, there are so-called semiconductor fuses de-
signed to open very quickly in the event of an overcurrent condition. Semiconductor devices
such as transistors tend to be especially intolerant of overcurrent conditions, and as such re-
quire fast-acting protection against overcurrents in high-power applications.
