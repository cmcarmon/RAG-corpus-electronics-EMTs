The time constant of an LR circuit may also be defined as the time required for the current in the inductor 
to grow or decay to its final value if it continued to grow or decay at its initial rate. For all practical 
purposes, the current in the inductor reaches a maximum value in 5 "Time Constants" and decreases to 
zero in 5 "Time Constants".
