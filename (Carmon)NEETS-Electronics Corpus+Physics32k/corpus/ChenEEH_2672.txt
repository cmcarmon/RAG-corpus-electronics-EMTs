However, these frequency-domain techniques have difﬁcul-
ties and trade-offs. For example, while asymptotic analyses are
well suited for modeling the scattering properties of electrically
large complex shapes, such analyses have difﬁculty treating
nonmetallic material composition and volumetric complexity
of a structure. While integral equation methods can deal with
material and structural complexity, their need to construct and
solve systems of linear equations limits the electrical size of
possible models, especially those requiring detailed treatment
of geometric details in a volume as opposed to just the surface
shape.
