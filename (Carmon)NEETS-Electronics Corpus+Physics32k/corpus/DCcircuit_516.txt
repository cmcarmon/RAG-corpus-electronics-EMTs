This board appears copper-side-up: the side where all the soldering is done. Each hole is
ringed with a small layer of copper metal for bonding to the solder. All holes are independent
of each other on this particular board, unlike the holes on a solderless breadboard which are
connected together in groups of Ô¨Åve. Printed circuit boards with the same 5-hole connection
pattern as breadboards can be purchased and used for hobby circuit construction, though.
