1. Repeatedly divide the integer part of the decimal number by 2. Use the remainder after
each division to form the equivalent binary number. Continue this process until a zero
quotient is obtained. With the ﬁrst remainder being the least signiﬁcant bit, form the binary
number by using the remainder after each division.
