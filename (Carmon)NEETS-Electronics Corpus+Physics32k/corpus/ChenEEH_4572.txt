Because the successful fault accommodation relies on pre-
cise failure diagnosis and both processes have to be successfully
achieved in the online and real-time situation for the unantici-
pated failures, it has been almost impossible to accomplish and
guarantee the system safety based solely on the contemporary
control technique with insufÔ¨Åcient and/or imprecise informa-
tion of the failure. Nevertheless, it is believed that technology
breakthrough will not happen overnight. Instead, it occurs
with slow progress, one step at a time. An early work
(Yen and Ho, 2000), where two online control
laws were
developed and reported for a special nonlinear system with
unanticipated component failures, focuses on dealing with
the general unanticipated system component failures for
