for that instant when the a-phase current is a positive maximum; Figure 12.3.2(b) refers to that
instant when the b-phase current is a positive maximum; the intervening time corresponds to
120 electrical degrees. It can be seen from Figure 12.3.2 that during this time interval, the
resultant sinusoidal mmf waveform has traveled (or rotated through) 120 electrical degrees
of the periphery of the stator structure carrying the three-phase winding. That is to say, the
resultant mmf is rotating in synchronism with time variations in current, with its peak amplitude
remaining constant at 3/2 times that of the maximum phase value. Note that the peak value of
the resultant stator mmf wave coincides with the axis of a particular phase winding when that
phase winding carries its peak current. The graphical process can be continued for different
instants of time to show that the resultant mmf is in fact rotating in synchronism with the supply
frequency.
