Klystron: An ampliﬁer device for UHF and microwave signals based on velocity modulation of an electron
beam.  The  beam  is  directed  through  an  input  cavity,  where  the  input  RF  signal  polarity  initializes  a
bunching effect on electrons in the beam. The bunching effect excites subsequent cavities, which increase
the bunching through an energy ﬂywheel concept. Finally, the beam passes an output cavity that couples
the  ampliﬁed  signal  to  the  load  (antenna  system).  The  beam  falls  onto  a  collector  element  that  forms
the return path for the current and dissipates the heat resulting from electron beam bombardment.
