To read the resistance between the collector and base and the collector and emitter, set the
FUNCTION switch to OHMS C-B and OHMS C-E. These in-circuit electrode resistance measurements
are used to correctly interpret the in-circuit beta measurements. The accuracy of the BETA X1, X10 range
is â€“ 15 percent only when the emitter-to-base load is equal to or greater than 300 ohms.
