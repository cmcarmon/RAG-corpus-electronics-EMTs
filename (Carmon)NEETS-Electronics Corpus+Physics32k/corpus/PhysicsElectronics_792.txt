All latches have two inputs: data and enable/disable. And typically Q and Q outputs. A
ones-catching latch can be built as shown in Ô¨Ågure 7.17.
When the control input C is false, the output Q follows the input D, but when the con-
trol input goes true, the output latches true as soon as D goes true and then stays there
independent of further changes in D.
