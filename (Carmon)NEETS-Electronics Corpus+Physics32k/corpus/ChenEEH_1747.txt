The audio media type has loose requirements on packet
loss/errors (or loss/error tolerance) in the sense that it can
tolerate up to 1 to 2% packet loss/error without much degra-
dation. Today, most multimedia applications that use audio
have built-in mechanisms to deal with the lost packets using
advanced interpolation techniques.
