c) Now assume that as a filter designer, you are faced with the problem of selecting
the inductor value to produce relatively smooth, ripple-free current in a load from a
voltage source with a strongly pulsating value, such as the half-wave rectified sine
wave shown in Figure 10.114. What method would you use to specify the inductor
value with which to achieve a specified maximum variation in load current? Why
might the specifications of a huge L value, much larger than might be needed, be a
poor design?
