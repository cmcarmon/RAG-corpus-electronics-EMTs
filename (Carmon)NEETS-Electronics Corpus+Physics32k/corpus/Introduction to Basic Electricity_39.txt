Digital	circuits	–	these	are	the	circuits	that	rely	heavily	on	Boolean	algebra
(i.e.	values	are	either	true	or	false,	or	as	denoted	1	or	0);	therefore,	these
circuits	 are	 often	 dependent	 on	 transistors	 that	 can	 create	 closed	 logic.
Compared	to	analog	circuits,	these	follow	a	state-of-the-art	design.
Furthermore,	 digital	 circuits	 are	 designed	 to	 create	 either	 numerical	 or
logical	 values	 for	 the	 representation	 of	 electricity	 that	 flows	 within	 their
system.	 Since	 these	 are	 not	 only	 focused	 on	 the	 mere	 ability	 to	 take	 in
electric	current,	but	rather,	on	the	individual	properties	of	all	of	their	parts,
as	 well,	 these	 circuits	 come	 with	 advanced	 functions;	 they	 can	 provide
memory	and	accomplish	arbitrary	computations.
Analog-digital	 –	 these	 circuits	 are	 sometimes	 called	 hybrid	 circuits	 or
mixed	 signal	 circuits	 since	 both	 system	 designs	 of	 analog	 and	 digital
circuits	are	given	light.	Although	their	concept	can	be	quite	complex,	these
circuits	can	deliver	a	more	thorough	result;	the	procedures	are	combined,
which	 allows	 collaborative	 effort	 from	 different	 parts.	 One	 example	 is	 a
telephone	receiver;	first,	it	works	based	on	analog	circuitry	to	create	and
stabilize	signals,	then,	based	on	digital	circuitry,	these	signals	are	converted
into	digital	units,	and	finally,	are	subjected	to	interpretation.
