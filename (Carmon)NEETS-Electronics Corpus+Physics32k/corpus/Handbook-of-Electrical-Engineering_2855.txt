 and variable thermal conductivity depending
on the volume mix of copper and Invar in the substrate. Copper has a high TCE and Invar has a low TCE, so
the TCE increases with the thickness of the copper layers. In addition to heat transfer considerations, board
material decisions must also be based on the expected vibration, stress, and humidity in the application.
