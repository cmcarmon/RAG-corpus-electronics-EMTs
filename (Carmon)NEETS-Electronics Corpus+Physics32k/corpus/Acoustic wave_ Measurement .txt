Sound pressure can be measured directly using a microphone. Particle velocity can be measured directly using a particle velocity probe. It is also possible to measure the quantities indirectly using the opposite instrument. Sound intensity can be measured using different combinations:
Microphone and particle velocity probe (p-u probe)
Two microphones (p-p probe)
Two particle velocity probes (u-u probe)
The sound pressure is measured in pascal, the particle velocity in meters per second, and the sound intensity in watts. Often these quantities are measured as a level in decibels relative to a certain quantity.
