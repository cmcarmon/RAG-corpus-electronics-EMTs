• Although initially not widely accepted, it was observed that the rich vocabulary made it very difﬁcult to
set up an efﬁcient processing pipeline for the instruction stream. In essence, the assembly line was forced
to handle too many special cases and slowed down under the burden. When the analysis of compiled
programs  showed  that  only  a  limited  span  of  instructions  was  being  used,  these  prescient  designers
decided to include only the heavily used instructions and to restrict even these instructions so that they
would ﬂow in unblemished, uniform streams through the production line. Because this focus resulted
in noticeably fewer instructions— though that was not the essential objective—the machines were called
RISC, a sobriquet that came out of a VLSI design project at Berkeley [Patterson and Hennessy, 1989].
