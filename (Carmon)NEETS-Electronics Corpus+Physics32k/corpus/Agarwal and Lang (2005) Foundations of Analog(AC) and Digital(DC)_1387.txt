Examination of the waveforms in Figure 10.5a and 10.5b indicates that the
presence of the capacitor has changed the shape of the input wave. When a square
pulse is applied to the RC circuit, a decidedly non-square pulse, with slow rise
and slow decay, results. The capacitor has allowed us to do a limited amount
of wave shaping. This concept can be further developed by an experiment in
which we drive the circuit with a square wave.
