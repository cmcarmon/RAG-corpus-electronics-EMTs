one	by	one.	First,	make	sure	that	it	is	not	connected	to	any	power	source.	After	putting	on
protective	gloves,	begin	taking	apart	a	component;	then,	determine	its	function.	Repeat	the
procedures	until	you	know	the	purpose	of	the	parts	and	the	importance	of	having	them
work	as	a	network.
Now,	put	them	all	back	together;	make	sure	the	circuit	works.
Such	a	process	is	called	reverse	engineering.
