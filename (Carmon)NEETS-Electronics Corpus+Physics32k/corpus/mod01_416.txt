When a battery is being charged, a portion of the energy breaks down the water in the electrolyte. 
Hydrogen is released at the negative plates and oxygen at the positive plates. These gases bubble up 
through the electrolyte and collect in the air space at the top of the cell. If violent gassing occurs when the 
battery is first placed on charge, the charging rate is too high. If the rate is not too high, steady gassing 
develops as the charging proceeds, indicating that the battery is nearing a fully charged condition.
