The performance measure for speech enhancement is task dependent. For signal estimation and coding, this
measure is given in terms of a distortion measure between the clean signal and the estimated or the encoded
signals, respectively. For signal classiﬁcation applications the performance measure is normally the probability
of misclassiﬁcation. Commonly used distortion measures are the mean-squared error (MSE) and the Itakura-
Saito  distortion  measures.  The  Itakura-Saito  distortion  measure  is  a  measure  between  two  power  spectral
densities, of which one is usually that of the clean signal and the other of a model for that signal [Gersho and
Gray, 1991]. This distortion measure is normally used in designing speech coding systems and it is believed to
be perceptually meaningful. Both measures are mathematically tractable and lead to intuitive estimation and
coding  schemes.  Systems  designed  using  these  two  measures  need  not  be  optimal  only  in  the  MSE  and  the
Itakura-Saito  sense,  but  they  may  as  well  be  optimal  in  other  more  meaningful  senses  (see  a  discussion  in
Ephraim [1992]).
