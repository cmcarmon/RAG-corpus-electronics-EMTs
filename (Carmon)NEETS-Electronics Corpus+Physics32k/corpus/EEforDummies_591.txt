 sensitive electronic equipment protect the equipment from large  voltage 
spikes. The diode is placed backward so that it’s normally reverse‐
biased, acting like an open circuit and not playing any part in the normal 
operation of the circuit. However, under abnormal circuit conditions, if a 
large voltage spike occurs, the diode becomes forward‐biased — which 
limits the voltage across the sensitive component and shunts excess 
current to ground to prevent harm to the component. (The diode may 
not be so lucky.)
