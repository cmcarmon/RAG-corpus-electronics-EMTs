A system is said to be in a transient state when a process variable or variables have been changed and the system has not yet reached a steady state.The time taken for the circuit to change from one steady state to another steady state is called the transient time. Transient analysis KVL and KCL to circuits containing energy storage elements results in differential.
A transient process is a process in which process variables change over time.
Transient analysis L andstudyto circuits containing energy storage elements results in differential. study of transient processes.
