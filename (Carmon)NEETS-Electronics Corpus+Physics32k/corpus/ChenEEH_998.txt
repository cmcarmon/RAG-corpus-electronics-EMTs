battery technology, and without low-power design techniques,
current and future portable devices will suffer from either very
short battery life or very heavy battery pack (Pedram, 1995;
Najm, 1994; Athas et al., 1994; Landman and Rabaey, 1995;
Tsul et al., 1995; Chang and Pedram, 1997; Bajwa et al., 1997).
It is clear that in the absence of low-power design techniques,
portable and handheld products would suffer from a very
short battery life, and packing and cooling them would be
very difÔ¨Åcult (Tsui et al., 1995; Ko et al., 1995). These factors
lead to an unavoidable increase in the cost of the product, as
shown in Figure 5.7. In addition, reliability is strongly affected
