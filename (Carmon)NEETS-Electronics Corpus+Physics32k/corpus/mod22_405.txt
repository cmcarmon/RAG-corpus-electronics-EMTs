Direct-access storage allows you to access the 125th record without first having to read the 124 
records in front of it. Magnetic disks and drums are examples of direct-access storage media. Data can be 
obtained quickly from anywhere on the media. However, the amount of time it takes to access a record is 
dependent to some extent on the mechanical process involved. It is usually necessary to scan some (but 
not all) of the preceding data.
