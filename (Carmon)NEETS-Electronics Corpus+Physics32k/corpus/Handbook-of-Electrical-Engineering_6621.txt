In order to provide the same advantages of ISDN to broadband communication users, network operators,
and service providers, the development of an intelligent broadband-ISDN (B-ISDN) is necessary. The future
B-ISDN will become the universal network integrating different kinds of services with their individual features
and requirements. B-ISDN will support switched, semipermanent and permanent, point-to-point, and point-
to-multipoint  connections  and  provide  on-demand,  reserved,  and  permanent  services.  B-ISDN  connections
support packet mode and circuit mode services of mono- and/or multimedia type of a connection-oriented or
connectionless nature in a unidirectional or bidirectional conﬁguration [Händel and Huber, 1991b].
