. Flash memory is a more efﬁcient version of EEPROM.
Unlike EEPROM, for which the data are byte-erasable
and rewritable, ﬂash memory erases and writes data in
ﬁxed size block (see Figure 1.6). This effectively improves
the performance of ﬂash memory as compared to typical
EEPROM. At ﬁrst, the expectation for ﬂash memory is to
replace the hard drive as the adopted mass media storage.
This adoption would be a major improvement in mass
storage media considering that the access time of ﬂash
memory is about 100 ns, whereas the access time of hard
disks is in milliseconds. The takeover, however, has not
occurred because ﬂash memory is still far too costly to be
used as a mass storage device. Presently, ﬂash memory is
mainly used in digital photography industry as ﬁlm for
storing digital pictures. The life expectancy of a ﬂash
memory is roughly 10,000 erasures.
