In aerodynamics, aerodynamic drag is the fluid drag force that acts on any moving solid body in the direction of the fluid freestream flow. From the body's perspective (near-field approach), the drag results from forces due to pressure distributions over the body surface, symbolized




D

p
r




{\displaystyle D_{pr}}
, and forces due to skin friction, which is a result of viscosity, denoted




D

f




{\displaystyle D_{f}}
. Alternatively, calculated from the flowfield perspective (far-field approach), the drag force results from three natural phenomena: shock waves, vortex sheet, and viscosity.
