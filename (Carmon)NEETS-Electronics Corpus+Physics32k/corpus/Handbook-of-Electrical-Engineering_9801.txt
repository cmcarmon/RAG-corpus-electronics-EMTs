Approximation of Continuous Systems by Discrete Models
Modern control systems often are implemented digitally, and many modern sensors provide digital output, as
shown in Fig. 100.3. In designing or analyzing such systems discrete-time approximate models of continuous-
time systems are frequently needed. There are several general ways of proceeding, as shown in Fig. 100.4. Many
choices exist for each path on the ﬁgure. Alternative choices of states or of approximation methods, such as
forward or backward differences, lead to an inﬁnite number of valid models.
