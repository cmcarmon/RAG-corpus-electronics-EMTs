The new adders of Yikes have the following properties: For a logical 0, the new adders
produce a voltage level of 1.7 V at their outputs. Similarly, when outputting a logical 1,
their adders produce the voltage level of 4.5 V. The new Yikes adders interpret all
signals between 0 V and 1.5 V at their inputs as a logical 0, and all signals between 4 V
and 5 V as a logical 1. Their behavior for input signals in the 1.5 V to 4 V range is
undefined.
