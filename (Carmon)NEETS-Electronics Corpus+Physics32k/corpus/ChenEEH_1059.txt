Circuit Design Style
Currently, the majority of digital VLSI systems are designed
using static CMOS (SCMOS) circuit style. The main reasons
for adopting SCMOS in designing VLSI systems are robustness
(i.e., low sensitivity to noise) and low power with no static
power consumption. SCMOS circuits are characterized by
almost ideal voltage transfer characteristic (VTC) curvesâ€”
symmetrical shape, full logic swing, and high noise margins.
