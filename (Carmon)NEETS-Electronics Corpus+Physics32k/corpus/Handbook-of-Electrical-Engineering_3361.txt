Optical intensity modulators can be fabricated by combining two passive Y-junctions with a phase modulator
situated between them. The result, which is shown in Fig. 31.21, is a guided-wave implementation of the classic
Mach–Zehnder interferometer. In this device the incoming light is split into two equal components by the ﬁrst
