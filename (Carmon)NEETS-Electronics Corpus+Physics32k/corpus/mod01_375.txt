The electrolyte of the silver-cadmium cell is potassium hydroxide and water as in the nickel-
cadmium and silver-zinc cells. The anode is silver oxide as in the silver-zinc cell and the cathode is 
cadmium hydroxide as in the nicad cell. You may notice that different combinations of materials are used 
to form the electrolyte, cathode, and anode of different cells. These combinations provide the cells with 
different qualities for many varied applications.
