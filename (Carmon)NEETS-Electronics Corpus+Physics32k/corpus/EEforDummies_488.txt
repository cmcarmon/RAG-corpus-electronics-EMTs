Calculating the RL time constant
You can calculate the amount of time (in seconds) it takes for the current 
flowing through an inductor in a resistor‐inductor circuit to reach a steady 
DC value. To do this, you use the RL time constant, Τ, which tells you how 
long it takes for the inductor to conduct roughly two‐thirds of the steady DC 
current that results from a voltage applied across the resistor‐inductor series 
combination. The formula looks like this:
