which are the singular values of A; the columns of U are the left
singular vectors, and the columns of V the right singular
vectors. Singular values are unique although singular vectors
are not. The SVD is quite useful and reliable in determining the
rank of a constant matrix or its pseudoinverse and in the realiza-
tion of transfer function matrices. By construction, singular
values are the positive square root of the eigenvalues of AA.
