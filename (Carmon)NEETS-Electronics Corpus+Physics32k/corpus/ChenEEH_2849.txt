There are different types of radars. According to the physical
relationship between the transmitting and receiving antennas,
they can be classiﬁed into monostatic radars and bistatic
radars. The monostatic radar has a common antenna used
for both transmitting and receiving, while the bistatic radar
has transmitting and receiving antennas separated by a con-
siderable distance. According to the waveforms transmitted,
radars can be classiﬁed into continuous wave (CW) radars or
pulsed radars. A CW radar’s transmitter operates continuously.
