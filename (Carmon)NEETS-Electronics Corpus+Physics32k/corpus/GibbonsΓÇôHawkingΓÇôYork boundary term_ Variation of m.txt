There are many theories which attempt to modify General Relativity in different ways, for example f(R) gravity replaces R, the Ricci scalar in the Einstein-Hilbert action with a function f(R). Guarnizo et al. found the boundary term for a general f(R) theory. They found that "the modified action in the metric formalism of f(R) gravity plus a Gibbons- York-Hawking like boundary term must be written as:

By using the ADM decomposition and introducing extra auxiliary fields, in 2009 Deruelle et al. found a method to find the boundary term for "gravity theories whose Lagrangian is an arbitrary function of the Riemann tensor." This can be used to find the GHY boundary terms for Infinite derivative gravity.
