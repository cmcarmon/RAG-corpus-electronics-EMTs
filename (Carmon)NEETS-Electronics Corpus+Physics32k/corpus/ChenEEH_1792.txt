Skew implies constantly increasing the difference between
the desired presentation times and the actual presentation
times of streamed multimedia objects. This effect is shown in
Figure 7.3(C). The effect of skew in the presentation times of
consecutive frames in a video will be a slow- or fast-moving
picture. Jitter can be removed only by buffering at the receiver
side.
