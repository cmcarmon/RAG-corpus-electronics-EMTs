Figure  38-4  shows  two  transistors  connected 
 together to function as a single unit. This circuit 
 arrangement is called a Darlington arrangement. 
Transistor Q1 is used to control the conduction of tran-
sistor Q2. The input signal applied to the base of transis-
tor Q1 controls the base of transistor Q2. The Darlington 
arrangement may be a single package with three leads: 
emitter (E), base (B), and collector (C). It is used as a 
simple DC amplifier but offers a very high voltage gain.
