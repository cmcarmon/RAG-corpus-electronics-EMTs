Again,  it  is  imperative  that  all  members  of  the  design,  build,  and  test  teams  be  involved  from  the  design
stage. Todayâ€™s complex board designs mean that it is entirely possible to exceed the ability to adequately test a
board if the test is not designed-in, or to robustly manufacture the board if in-line inspections and handling
are not adequately considered. Robustness of both test and manufacturing are only assured with full involvement
of all parties to overall board design and production.
