number of poles. The faster the speed, the higher the frequency. The lower the speed, the lower the
frequency. The more poles there are on the rotor, the higher the frequency is for a given speed. When a
rotor has rotated through an angle such that two adjacent rotor poles (a north and a south pole) have
passed one winding, the voltage induced in that winding will have varied through one complete cycle. For
a given frequency, the more pairs of poles there are, the lower the speed of rotation. This principle is
