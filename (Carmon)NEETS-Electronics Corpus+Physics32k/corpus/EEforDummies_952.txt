▶✓ Consider using silver solder. If you’re concerned about health issues — 
or tend to stick your fingers in your mouth or rub your eyes a lot — you 
may want to avoid solders that contain lead. Instead, use silver solder 
specifically designed for use on electronic equipment. (Never use acid‐
flux solder in electronics; it wrecks your circuits.)
