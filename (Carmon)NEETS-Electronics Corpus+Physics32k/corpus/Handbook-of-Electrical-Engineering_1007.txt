In the above strategy we have omitted various parameters either because they have minimal effect or because
they have the wrong effect and were modiﬁed in the BSIM2 model. Because of the higher complexity of the
BSIM model over the level 3 model, many more strategies are possible than the one just listed. One may be
able to ﬁnd variations of the above strategy that suit the individual technology better. Whatever modiﬁcations
are made, the general spirit of the above strategy probably will remain.
