The frequency plan for C- and Ku-band satellite services is shown in Fig. 102.6. The typical transmit frequency
band  used  for  ﬁxed  satellite  services  in  the  Ku-band  is  14.0–14.5  GHz.  Receive  frequency  is  11.7–12.2  GHz.
Some satellites also use the extended band. For C-band satellites, the typical operating transmit frequency is
5.925–6.425 GHz and the receive frequency is 3.7–4.2 GHz. The operating band was extended at WARC ’79 to
7.075 GHz to be assigned to individual countries for domestic satellite systems. Ka-band satellites have down-
links in the frequency range 17–23 GHz and uplinks in the range 27–31 GHz. Some European and Japanese
satellites operate in this range [Long, 1991].
