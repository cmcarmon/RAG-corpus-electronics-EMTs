which is the resistance when the light bulb is turned on. If the
cost of electricity is 5 ¢(kWh),
it would cost $2.70
(¼ 75  24  30  0:05=1000) to light this bulb continuously
for 1 month. The resistance in equation 1.19 will likely be very
different than when the light bulb is off and cold. From
equation 1.9 using equation 1.12:
