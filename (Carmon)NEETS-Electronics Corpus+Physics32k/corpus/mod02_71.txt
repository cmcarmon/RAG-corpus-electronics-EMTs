 In figure 2-2(B), the same section of conductor 2 is shown after the switch has been opened. The flux 
field is collapsing. Applying the left-hand rule in this case shows that the reversal of flux MOVEMENT 
has caused a reversal in the direction of the induced voltage. The induced voltage is now in the same 
direction as the battery voltage. The most important thing for you to note is that the self-induced voltage 
opposes BOTH changes in current. That is, when the switch is closed, this voltage delays the initial 
buildup of current by opposing the battery voltage. When the switch is opened, it keeps the current 
flowing in the same direction by aiding the battery voltage.
