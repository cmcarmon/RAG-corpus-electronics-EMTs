Again, assume that a missile is riding (following) the axis of a single beam. The strength of the
signals it receives (by means of a radar receiver in the missile) will gradually decrease as its distance from
the transmitter increases. If the signal strength decreases suddenly, the missile will know, from built-in
detection circuitry, that it is no longer on the axis of the lobe. But it will not know which way to turn to
get back on the axis. A simple beam does not contain enough information for missile guidance.
