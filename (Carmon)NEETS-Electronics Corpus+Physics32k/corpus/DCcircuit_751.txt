While this is an extreme example of nonlinear conduction, other substances exhibit similar
insulating/conducting properties when exposed to high voltages. Obviously, an ohmmeter using
a low-voltage battery as a source of power cannot measure resistance at the ionization potential
of a gas, or at the breakdown voltage of an insulator. If such resistance values need to be
measured, nothing but a high-voltage ohmmeter will sufÔ¨Åce.
