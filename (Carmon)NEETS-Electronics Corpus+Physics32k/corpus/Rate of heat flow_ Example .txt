Assume there are two systems with the same mass and specific heat. System A has an average temperature of 500 kelvins, and system B has an average temperature of 400 K. If 30 seconds after the systems are put in contact they both reach 450 K, then the average rate of heat flow is
50 J/(30 s) â‰ˆ 1.67 W.
(note: specific heat capacities = 1 J/(kg K) and masses = 1 kg).
