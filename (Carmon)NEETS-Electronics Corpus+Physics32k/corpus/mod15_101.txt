When the transmitter rotor is turned, the rotor field follows and the magnetic coupling between the 
rotor and stator windings changes. This results in the transmitter S2 coil voltage decreasing to 26 volts, 
the S3 coil voltage reversing direction, and the S1 coil voltage increasing to 52 volts. This imbalance in 
voltages, between the transmitter and receiver, causes current to flow in the stator coils in the direction of 
the stronger voltages. The current flow in the receiver produces a resultant magnetic field in the receiver 
stator in the same direction as the rotor field in the transmitter. A force (torque) is now exerted on the 
receiver rotor by the interaction between its resultant stator field and the magnetic field around its rotor. 
This force causes the rotor to turn through the same angle as the rotor of the transmitter. As the receiver
