Fig. 54.1 to be designed into the sensor element. The modiﬁed lead titanate is doped with calcium titanate and
lead  cobalt  tungstate.  The  use  of  hot  pressing  in  ceramic  manufacture  permits  the  fabrication  of  very  low
porosity  material,  which  can  be  lapped  and  polished  to  very  thin  sections  (as  low  as  20  mm)  while  being
mechanically strong enough to be placed on a mount which provides support only over a small area, permitting
the fabrication of detectors with maximum sensitivity. While the Fv values are relatively small in these materials,
the FD values are as good as most of the single-crystal materials. They are very well suited to small-area detectors
because their high dielectric constants enable the element capacitance to be matched to that of the ampliﬁer.
Pyroelectric ceramics are now ﬁnding use in a wide range of the infrared detector market, from low-cost intruder
alarms to high-value imaging arrays.
