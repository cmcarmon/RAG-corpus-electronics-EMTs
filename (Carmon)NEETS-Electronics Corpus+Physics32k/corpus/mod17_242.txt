Letâ€™s look at our example. Assume the agc voltage is negative. Under this condition, Q1 is self
biased; under no-signal conditions, it is operating well up on its characteristic curve. When a signal is
applied, negative agc voltage is developed in the detector circuit and fed back to Q1, which increases
