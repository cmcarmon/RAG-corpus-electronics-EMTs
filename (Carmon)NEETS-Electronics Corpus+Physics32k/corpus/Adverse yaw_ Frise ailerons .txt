Frise ailerons are designed so that when up aileron is applied, some of the forward edge of the aileron will protrude downward into the airflow, causing increased drag on this (down-going) wing. This will counter the drag produced by the other aileron, thus reducing adverse yaw.
Unfortunately, as well as reducing adverse yaw, Frise ailerons will increase the overall drag of the aircraft much more than applying rudder correction. Therefore they are less popular in aircraft where minimizing drag is important (e.g. in a glider).
Note: Frise ailerons are primarily designed to reduce roll control forces. Contrary to the illustration, the aileron leading edge has to be rounded to prevent flow separation and flutter at negative deflections. That prevents important differential drag forces.
