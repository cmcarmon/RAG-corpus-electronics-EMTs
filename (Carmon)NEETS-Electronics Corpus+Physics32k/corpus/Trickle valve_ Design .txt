A well designed trickle valve has few or no moving parts. Most trickle valves are also adjustable as to how much vacuum pressure it takes to operate. Adjustments are typically made with a weighted counterbalance or an adjustable leaf spring. Because these valves have no way to force clogs through, they are only recommended for use with dry and relatively dense, free-flowing materials such as sand, fly ash, and cement.
