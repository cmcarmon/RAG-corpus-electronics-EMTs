Having  shown  that  application  of  a  dc  electric  ﬁeld  to  nonexcitable,  connective  tissue  cells  can  produce
effects similar to those elicited by mechanical stress, Bassett and his co-workers realized that clinical exploitation
of these phenomena would require surgical implantation of electrodes with attendant danger of infection. They
proceeded therefore to explore whether noninvasive, inductive coupling that gave waveforms similar to those
endogenously produced by mechanical stress could lead to beneﬁcial bone development. In 1974 they reported
favorable results obtained with pulsed electromagnetic ﬁelds on dogs [Bassett et al., 1964]. Signals of this type
have generally been identiﬁed as PEMF (pulsed electromagnetic ﬁeld) in the orthopedics/electrical stimulation
community for the last 20 years and have been applied successfully in a large number of cases for the repair of
nonunions [Grossling et al., 1992]. In Germany relatively large-amplitude, low-frequency (<20 Hz) sinusoidal
magnetic ﬁelds have been used for both bone repair and wound healing [Kraus, 1984].
