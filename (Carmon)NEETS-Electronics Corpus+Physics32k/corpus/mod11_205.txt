An example of a highly stable tunnel-diode oscillator is shown in figure 2-40. A tunnel-diode is 
loosely coupled to a high-Q tunable cavity. Loose coupling is achieved by using a short, antenna feed 
probe placed off-center in the cavity. Loose coupling is used to increase the stability of the oscillations 
and the output power over a wider bandwidth.
