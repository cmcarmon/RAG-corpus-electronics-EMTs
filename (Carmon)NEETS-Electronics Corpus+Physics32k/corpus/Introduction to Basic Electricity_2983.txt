At room temperature the number of donated free 
electrons exceeds the number of electron-hole pairs. 
This means that there are more electrons than holes. 
The electrons are therefore called the  majority 
 carrier. The holes are minority carriers. Because 
the negative charge is the majority carrier, the material 
is called n-type material.
