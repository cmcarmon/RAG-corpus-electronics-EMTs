where  components  indicate  the  vector  electric  and  magnetic  Ô¨Åeld  components.  If  magnetic  materials  are
included, then six edges must also be considered for the material arrays. In this equation, we have neglected
the relatively small number of auxiliary variables needed for the computation process.
