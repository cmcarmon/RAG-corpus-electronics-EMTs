Notice that the change in the output current id is linearly related to the
change in the input voltage vi provided that vi is small compared to VI. We
note that Equation 8.9 is exact because the small-signal model goes through the
exact model at the operating point. However, Equation 8.10 is approximate
because of the linearization.
