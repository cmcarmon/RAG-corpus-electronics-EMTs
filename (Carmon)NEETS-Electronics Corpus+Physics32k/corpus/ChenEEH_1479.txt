Perhaps the most inﬂuential current operating system is
UNIX, a complete re-engineering of Multics, originally de-
veloped at AT&T Bell Laboratories for the DEC PDP com-
puters. Although its size is much smaller than Multics, UNIX
retains most of its predecessor’s useful characteristics. It also
introduces the pipe. The powerful yet simple shell command
language together with a large library of utility programs make
the UNIX an extremely high productive system for informa-
tion professionals. Most of UNIX is written in the high-level
language C, allowing it to be transported to a wide variety of
processors from mainframes to personal computers (Ritchie
and Thompson, 1974; Kernighan and Pike, 1984).
