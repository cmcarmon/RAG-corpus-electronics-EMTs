One possible way around the problem of the limited spectrum available for wireless LANs is to use infrared
light as the transmission medium. There are both direct infrared systems (range: 1â€“3 mi) and nondirect systems
(bounced  off  walls  or  ceilings).  For  small  areas  data  rates  are  consistent  with  those  of  existing  ethernet  and
token ring networks with 100-Mb/s systems on the horizon.
