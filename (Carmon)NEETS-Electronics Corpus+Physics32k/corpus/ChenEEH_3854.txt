Because the DCT highly concentrates the energy in few
coefﬁcients, a large number of the DCT coefﬁcients are zero
after quantization. Therefore, a coding method that avoids
explicitly encoding the zeros can be very efﬁcient. In practice,
this is achieved by scanning the quantized DCT coefﬁcients as
in Figure 4.23 prior to encoding. Then, instead of encoding
each coefﬁcient, one encodes the pairs (run, level); level indi-
cates the quantized value of the nonzero coefﬁcient, while run
indicates the number of zeros that comes before them. The
encoding is performed using an entropy coder, like a Huffman
or arithmetic coder. High compression rates can be achieved
using such schemes. For example,
the JPEG standard
(Pennebaker and Mitchell, 1993) is essentially based on the
above scheme. The same applies to the H.261, H.263, MPEG-1,
MPEG-2, and MPEG-4 standards. Figure 4.24 shows the LENA
256  256 image encoded using JPEG with 0.5 bits/pixel and a
compression ratio of 16:1.
