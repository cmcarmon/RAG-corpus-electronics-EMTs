Suppose the signal is available in differential form. In other words, suppose the signal
is available as the relative voltage output (vA âˆ’ vB) on a pair of terminals A and B. For
example, as the output of the tape-head in a tape-recorder, the output of an instrumen-
tation device or a sensor. Such a sensor often resembles one of our primitive elements
for example, a variable resistor. The element might produce a voltage signal across its
terminals related to some externally sensed parameter such as temperature, gas con-
centration, or magnetic field strength. Often, a pair of wires carrying the signal might
travel through a noisy environment resulting in the coupling of more or less the same
amount of noise (vn) on each of the two wires, as depicted in Figure 8.25.2 In other
situations, the two wires might both carry a common DC bias. In such situations, a
difference amplifier can help amplify just the differential signal component and discard
the common noise component.
