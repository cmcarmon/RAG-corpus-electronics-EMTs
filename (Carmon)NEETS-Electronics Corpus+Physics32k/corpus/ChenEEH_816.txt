All VHDL–AMS models are operational and were thor-
oughly tested by means of the ADVanceMS simulator from
Mentor Graphics. Unfortunately, the complete set cannot be
presented for space restriction reasons. All models of this
depth gauge and additional information on other complex
multinature modeling projects are available at the author’s
site. (www.vlsi.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/vhdlams/)
