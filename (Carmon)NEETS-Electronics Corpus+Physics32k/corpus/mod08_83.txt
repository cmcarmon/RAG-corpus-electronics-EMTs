Whether an amplifier is one of a series in a device or a single stage connected between two other 
devices (top view, figure 1-8), there must be some way for the signal to enter and leave the amplifier. The 
process of transferring energy between circuits is known as COUPLING. There are various ways of 
coupling signals into and out of amplifier circuits. The following is a description of some of the more 
common methods of amplifier coupling.
