RELAP5-3D has multidimensional thermal hydraulics and neutron kinetic modeling capabilities. The multidimensional component in RELAP5-3D was developed to allow the user to accurately model the multidimensional flow behavior that can be exhibited in any component or region of a nuclear reactor coolant system. There is also two dimensional conductive and radiative heat transfer capability and modeling of plant trips and control systems. RELAP5-3D allows for the simulation of the full range of reactor transients and postulated accidents, including:
Trips and controls
Component models (pumps, valves, separators, branches, etc.)
Operational transients
Startup and shutdown
Maneuvers (e.g. change in power level, starting/tripping pump)
Small and large break Loss Of Coolant Accidents (LOCA)
Anticipated Transient Without Scram (ATWS)
Loss of offsite power
Loss of feedwater
Loss of flow
Light Water Reactors (PWR, BWR, APWR, ABWR, etc.)
Heavy Water Reactors (e.g. CANDU reactor)
Gas-cooled Reactors (VHTGR, NGNP)
Liquid metal cooled reactors
Molten-salt cooled reactors
