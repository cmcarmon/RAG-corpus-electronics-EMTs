The initial idea was to control the outcome of chemical reactions. Two approaches were pursued: In the time domain a pump dump scheme where the control is the time delay between pulses   and in the frequency domain, interfering pathways controlled by one and three photons. The two basic methods eventually merged with the introduction of optimal control theory  .
Experimental realisations soon followed. In the time domain  and in the frequency domain. Two interlinked developments accelerated the field of coherent control: Experimentally it was the development of pulse shaping by a spatial light modulator  and its employment in coherent control. The second development was the idea of automatic feedback control  and its experimental realization .
