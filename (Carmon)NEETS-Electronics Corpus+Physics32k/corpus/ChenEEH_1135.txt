There are many MEMS components whose primary function is
to move some small structure to accomplish a useful function.
The signals that cause such motion are entirely electronic in
the case of electrostatic actuators. In some cases, electrical
energy is ﬁrst turned into thermal or magnetic energy to
induce motion on the micrometer scale. Some MEMS actu-
ators depend only on thermal effects. One type is based on the
atomic-scale phase transformation of ‘‘shape memory’’ alloys
that automatically assume a form given to them at one tem-
perature when they are returned to that temperature. Whatever
the physical origin of the small but effective forces in MEMS
actuators, interesting and useful changes in positions of a
micromechanical structure can result. Some of these will be
discussed in the rest of this section.
