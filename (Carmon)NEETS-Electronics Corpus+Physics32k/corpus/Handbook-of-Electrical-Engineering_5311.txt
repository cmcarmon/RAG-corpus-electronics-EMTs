By far the largest installed capacity (nearly 400 MW) of solar-thermal-electric DG employs parabolic-trough
collectors and oil to transport the thermal energy to a central location for conversion to electricity via a steam-
Rankine cycle. With the addition of a natural gas burner for hybrid operation, this technology, developed by
LUZ under the code name SEGS (solar electric generating system), accounts for more than 90% of the world’s
solar electric capacity, all located in Daggett, Kramer Junction, and Harper Lake in California. Generation costs
of around 8 to 9¢/kWh have been realized with SEGS. This technology uses natural gas to compensate for the
temporal  variations  of  insolation  and  ﬁrms  up  the  power  delivered  by  the  system.  This  compensation  may
. in winter. SEGS will require about 5 acres/MW
come during 7 to 11 
or can deliver 130 MW/mi
