of the amount of energy needed to reliably terminate ﬁbrillation (deﬁbrillate). Due to signiﬁcant advances in
the  size  and  energy  efﬁciency  of  ICD  systems,  it  is  now  possible  to  implant  the  ICD  pectorally  and  insert
specially developed electrode leads into the heart intravenously without the need for a thoracotomy. This ensures
greater patient comfort and signiﬁcantly reduces the risk associated with surgery. There are several different
lead conﬁgurations available, depending on the manufacturer, each with its own advantages. All of these systems
place  one  electrode  in  the  right  ventricular  apex,  while  the  position  of  the  return  electrode  varies  between
systems. Figure 115.15 shows a typical system layout in the body. The entire surgery can be performed through
a single incision, using only local anesthetics and heavy sedation, and is similar to that of the pacemaker. Lead
positioning is critical to obtaining low DFTs [Lang et al., 1995; Usui et al., 1995]. Once the lead(s) are in place,
the ICD is tested by inducing ﬁbrillation by artiﬁcial means and then giving a shock of known energy to halt
the  arrhythmia.  The  DFT  can  be  determined  by  a  number  of  different  methods,  such  as  by  decreasing  the
energy of each successive shock until the deﬁbrillation attempt is unsuccessful. The DFT must be well below
the maximum output energy of the device before a successful implant is declared; a 10-joule safety margin is
typically used [Moss et al., 1996]. If an adequate safety margin cannot be obtained through optimal electrode
placement,  additional  electrodes  may  be  required  in  order  to  obtain  an  acceptable  DFT.  In  extreme  cases,  a
thoracotomy may still be required. It is also necessary to thoroughly test the pacing/sensing characteristics as
with pacemakers.
