The MOSFET is the building block of the current ultra large-
scale integrated circuits (ICs). The growth and complexity of
MOS ICs have been continually increasing over the years to
enable faster and denser circuits. Shown in Figure 3.7 is the
simpliÔ¨Åed schematic of a MOSFET. The device consists of a
MOS gate stack formed between two pn junctions called the
source and drain junctions. The region under the gate is often
referred to as the channel region. The length and the width of
this region are called the channel length and channel width,
respectively. An inversion layer under the gate creates a con-
ductive path (i.e., channel) from source to drain and turns the
transistor on. When the channel forms right under the gate
dielectric, the MOSFET is referred to as a surface channel
MOSFET. Buried channel MOSFETs in which the channel
forms slightly beneath the surface are also used, but they are
becoming less popular with the continuous downscaling of
MOSFETs. A fourth contact to the substrate is also formed
and referred to as the body contact.
