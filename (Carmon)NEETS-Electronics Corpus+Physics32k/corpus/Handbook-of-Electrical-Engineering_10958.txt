The left-hand side of Eq. (113.9) is the so-called cable equation that was developed by Oliver Heaviside over
100 years ago in connection with the analysis of the ﬁrst transatlantic telegraphy cable. The right-hand side is
a  driving  function  due  to  the  external  ﬁeld  in  the  biological  medium.  For  additional  information  on  cable
theory as applied to the excitable membrane, the reader is directed to Jack et al. [1983].
