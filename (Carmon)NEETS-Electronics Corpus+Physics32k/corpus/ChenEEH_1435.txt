Fast compilation of conﬁgurable computing designs is impor-
tant. Depending on its complexity, the development cycle of a
design often takes a few minutes to many hours. If compilation
times for FPGAs were equivalent to today’s Cþþ or Java
compilers, productivity would increase tremendously. The
JBits tool suite, described in subsection 3.3.3, is capable of
rapid compilation provided that users place and route their
designs in detail. The JBits tools are being combined with other
design tools, such as JHDL (Bellows and Hutchings, 1998)
Pebble (Luk and McKeever, 1998) and Lava (Singh and
James-Roxby, 2001), so that high-level descriptions can be
compiled rapidly into efﬁcient hardware.
