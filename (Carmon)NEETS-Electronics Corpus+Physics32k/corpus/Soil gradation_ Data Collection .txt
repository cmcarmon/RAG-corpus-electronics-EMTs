Soil gradation is determined by analyzing the results of a sieve analysis or a hydrometer analysis.
In a sieve analysis, a coarse-grained soil sample is shaken through a series of woven-wire square-mesh sieves. Each sieve has successively smaller openings so particles larger than the size of each sieve are retained on the sieve. The percentage of each soil size is measured by weighing the amount retained on each sieve and comparing the weight to the total weight of the sample. The results of a sieve analysis are plotted as a grain size distribution curve, which is then analyzed to determine the soil gradation of the particular soil.
In a hydrometer analysis, a fine-grained soil sample is left to settle in a viscous fluid. This method is used based on Stoke's Law which relates terminal velocity of fall of a particle in a viscous fluid to the grain diameter and density of the grain in suspension.Grain diameter is calculated from a known distance and time of the fall of the particle. This is used to classify fine-grained soils.
