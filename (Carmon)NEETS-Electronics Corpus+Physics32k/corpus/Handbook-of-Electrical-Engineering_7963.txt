Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)
Gate arrays are semicustom devices based on an array of simple cells selected from a library surrounded by an
interconnection  network.  In  conventional  gate  array  technology,  the  interconnection  pattern  is  deﬁned  by
metallization layers applied at the ﬁnal stage of manufacture. FPGAs dispense with this ﬁnal stage by possessing
a ﬁxed interconnection network which includes programmable crosspoint switches, as shown in Fig. 81.47. The
cells, instead of being selected from a library, are generic and have programmable function. The price for doing
this  is  a  lower  logic  density  and  higher  resistance  interconnections,  with  concomitant  effect  on  speed  of
operation. Nevertheless, this disadvantage is more than overcome by the short design turnaround times achiev-
able. A major tradeoff in gate array architecture is between cell complexity and interconnection channel capacity.
This remains the case with FPGAs.
