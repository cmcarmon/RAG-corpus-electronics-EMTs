View (A) of figure 2-29 shows the carrier modulated with a square wave. In view (B) the modulating
square wave is increased in amplitude; note that the rf peaks increase in amplitude during the positive
alternation of the square wave and decrease during the negative half of the square wave. In view (C) the
amplitude of the square wave is further increased and the amplitude of the rf wave is almost 0 during the
negative alternation of the square wave.
