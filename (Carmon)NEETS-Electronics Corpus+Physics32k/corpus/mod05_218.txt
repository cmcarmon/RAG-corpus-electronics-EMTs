The exciter is a dc, shunt-wound, self-excited generator. The exciter shunt field (2) creates an area of
intense magnetic flux between its poles. When the exciter armature (3) is rotated in the exciter-field flux,
voltage is induced in the exciter armature windings. The output from the exciter commutator (4) is
connected through brushes and slip rings (5) to the alternator field. Since this is direct current already
converted by the exciter commutator, the current always flows in one direction through the alternator field
(6). Thus, a fixed-polarity magnetic field is maintained at all times in the alternator field windings. When
the alternator field is rotated, its magnetic flux is passed through and across the alternator armature
windings (7).
