Because of the use of point-to-point links, token rings can use various transmission media such as twisted-
pair wire or ﬁber-optic cables. The transmission speed of a token ring can range from 1 to 16 Mbps, depending
on  the  type  of  point-to-point  links  used.  Token  rings  are  often  wired  in  star  conﬁgurations  for  ease  of
.  In  1994  there  were  10  million  token  ring
installation.  Token  rings  are  covered  by  the 
nodes with 3–4 million new nodes being added each year.
