The VAD Process. The process is very similar to the OVD
process. However, the soot deposition is done axially instead
of radially. The soot is deposited at the end of a starting silica-
glass rod (Fig. 42.24). A special torch using several annular
holes  is  used  to  direct  a  stream  of  soot  at  the  deposition
surface.  The  reactant  vapors,  hydrogen  gas,  argon  gas,  and
oxygen  gas  ﬂow  through  different  annular  openings.  Nor-
mally the core is deposited and the rotating speed is gradually
withdrawn as the deposition proceeds at the end. The index
proﬁle is controlled by the composition of the gases ﬂowing
through  the  torch  and  the  temperature  distribution  at  the
deposition surface. The porous preform is consolidated and
dehydrated  as  it  passes  through  a  carbon-ring  furnace  in  a
