ac displays require that an ac signal, called the sustain voltage, be applied during operation as shown on the
right side of Fig. 83.27. A typical sustain frequency is 50 kHz. Figure 83.29 shows the details of this operation
for a pixel in both the on and off states. When a pixel is discharging, charge collects on the dielectric glass walls
and inï¬‚uences the voltage across the gas. The component of voltage due to this charge is called the wall voltage.
When a pixel is on, the wall voltage changes for each polarity reversal of the sustain voltage. This change in
wall voltage coincides with a pulse of light due to the gas discharge. When the pixel is off, there are no light
pulses, and the wall voltage remains at a zero level.
