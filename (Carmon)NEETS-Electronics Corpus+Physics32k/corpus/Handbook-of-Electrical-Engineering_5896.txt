DC Generators
To  obtain  dc  electricity,  one  may  prefer  an  available  ac  source  with  an  electronic  rectiÔ¨Åer  circuit.  Another
possibility  is  to  generate  dc  electricity  directly.  Although  the  latter  method  is  becoming  obsolete,  it  is  still
important to understand how a dc generator works. This section provides a brief discussion of the basic issues
associated with dc generators.
