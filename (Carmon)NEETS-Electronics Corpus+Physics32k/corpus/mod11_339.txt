FREQUENCY-SENSITIVE ANTENNAS use frequency-sensitive slots as radiation sources to 
achieve directivity. The angle at which the radiated beam leaves the antenna is determined by the 
frequency of the radiated energy. Currently the most common frequency-sensitive antennas use this 
feature to achieve elevation coverage while azimuth coverage is achieved by rotating the antennas. New 
systems will use stationary frequency-sensitive antennas to achieve both azimuth and elevation coverage.
