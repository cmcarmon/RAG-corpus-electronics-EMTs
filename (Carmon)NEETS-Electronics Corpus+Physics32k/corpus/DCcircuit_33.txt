This crude model is that of the element carbon, with six protons, six neutrons, and six
electrons. In any atom, the protons and neutrons are very tightly bound together, which is an
important quality. The tightly-bound clump of protons and neutrons in the center of the atom
is called the nucleus, and the number of protons in an atom’s nucleus determines its elemental
identity: change the number of protons in an atom’s nucleus, and you change the type of atom
that it is. In fact, if you could remove three protons from the nucleus of an atom of lead, you
will have achieved the old alchemists’ dream of producing an atom of gold! The tight binding
of protons in the nucleus is responsible for the stable identity of chemical elements, and the
failure of alchemists to achieve their dream.
