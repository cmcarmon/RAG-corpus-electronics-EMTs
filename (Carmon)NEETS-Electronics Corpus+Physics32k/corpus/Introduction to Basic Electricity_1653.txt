The resistance value is indicated by three or four 
digits. In either case, the last digit indicates the  number 
of zeros to be added to the preceding digits. In the 
 example given, the first two digits are 1 and 0, followed 
by 3 zeroes, for a value of 10,000 ohms. For values of 
less than 100 or 1000 (depending on the number of 
digits used), D is used to designate the decimal point. 
For example, 3D9 would represent 3.9 ohms. A 0â€‘ohm 
resistor or jumper is designated as 000.
