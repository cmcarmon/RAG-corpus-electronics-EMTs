transducing vibration and acceleration. Piezoelectric crystals functioning as strain gauges can be mounted to
the inside of the pacemaker to detect mechanical vibrations [Anderson and Moore, 1986]. In addition, accel-
erometers can be mounted directly to the hybrid circuit to detect acceleration [Kay, 1996]. Although both of
these sensors are subject to motion that may not be due to exercise, accelerometers have generally proven to
be  more  proportional  to  exercise  than  strain  gages  [Kay,  1996].  Another  sensor  that  has  been  successfully
integrated into pacemakers is the minute ventilation sensor. Minute ventilation is representative of the amount
of air a person breathes and can be estimated by measuring the transthoracic impedance over time. This can
be  accomplished  by  emitting  a  train  of  very  small  pulses  from  one  pole  of  a  bipolar  pacing  electrode  and
measuring the voltage between the other pole and the pacemaker can [Nappholz et al., 1986]. The impedance
calculated from the measured voltage rises when a person breathes in and falls when the person breathes out.
Combining activity sensors with minute ventilation sensors has proven to be a clinically successful approach
to estimating metabolic needs during exercise [Alt et al., 1995].
