1. Carefully set the unit (antenna, gun mount, director, etc.) whose position the CX or TX transmits, 
accurately on 0ยบ or on its reference position. In the case of the TR, deenergize the circuit and 
disconnect the stator leads before setting its rotor on zero or to its reference position. The rotor 
may need to be secured in this position; taping the dial to the frame is usually sufficient.
