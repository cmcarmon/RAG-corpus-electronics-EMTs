Overﬂow nonlinearities inﬂuence the most signiﬁcant bits of
the signal and cause severe distortion. An overﬂow can give
rise to self-sustained, high-amplitude oscillations known as
overﬂow limit cycles. Digital ﬁlters, which are free of zero-
input limit cycles, are also free of overﬂow oscillations if the
overﬂow nonlinearities are implemented with saturation arith-
metic, that is, by replacing the number in overﬂow by a
number with the same sign and with maximum magnitude
that ﬁts the available wordlength.
