Courant Factor Normalization and Extension
to Two- and One-Dimensional Grids
It is instructive to use the results of equation 9.78 to normalize
the Courant factor S in equation 9.81. This will permit us to
generalize the three-dimensional results for the maximum
growth factor q to two-dimensional and one-dimensional
(1-D) Yee (1966) grids. In this spirit, we deÔ¨Åne:
