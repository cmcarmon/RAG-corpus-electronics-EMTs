13.4.6 A dc series motor is connected to a load. The
torque varies as the square of the speed. With the
diverter-circuit open, the motor takes 20 A and
runs at 500 r/min. Determine the motor current
and speed when the diverter-circuit resistance is
made equal to the series-ﬁeld resistance. Neglect
saturation and the voltage drops across the series-
ﬁeld resistance as well as the armature resistance.
13.4.7 A 50-kW, 230-V compound generator has the fol-
lowing data: armature-circuit resistance 0.05 ,
series-ﬁeld circuit resistance 0.05 , and shunt-
ﬁeld circuit resistance 125 . Assuming the total
brush-contact drop to be 2 V, ﬁnd the induced
armature voltage at rated load and rated terminal
voltage for: (a) short-shunt, and (b) long-shunt
compound connection.
*13.4.8 A 50-kW, 250-V, short-shunt compound genera-
tor has the following data: Ra = 0.06 , RS =
0.04 , and Rf = 125 . Calculate the induced
armature voltage at rated load and terminal volt-
age. Take 2 V as the total brush-contact drop.
