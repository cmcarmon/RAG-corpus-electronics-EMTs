15. We can also modify the memory element circuit to include a reset signal as follows: In this
circuit, we use a second switch to discharge the capacitor to ground when the reset signal is high.
Additionally, to make this circuit work, we must use non-ideal switches that are designed such that
the ON resistance of the reset switch is much lower than that of the store switch. By doing so, we
can ensure that reset will override the store when the store and reset are on at the same time.
