Very good for problems with small characteristic as time marching scheme provides necessary numerical damping to control resonance interactions within and between particles.
Step-wise linear implicit time marching allows so-called quasi-static solutions, where step-wise velocities are never used. Quasi-static analysis is useful for examining slow, or creeping failures.
