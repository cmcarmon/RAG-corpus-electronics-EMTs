The above is an oversimplification and is not meant to describe a functioning system. The intent is to 
show a typical sequence of events between the demand for movement and the movement itself. It is meant 
to strengthen the idea that with the amplidyne, something large and heavy can be controlled very 
precisely by something very small, almost insignificant.
