Hydrocarbon  fuel  (natural  gas  or  LNG)  or  gasiﬁed  coal  is  reformed  ﬁrst  to  produce  hydrogen-rich  (and
sulphur-free) gas that enters the fuel cell stack where it is electrochemically “burned” to produce electrical and
thermal  outputs.  The  electrical  output  of  a  fuel  cell  is  low-voltage  high-current  dc.  By  utilizing  a  properly
organized stack of cells and an inverter, utility-grade ac output is obtained.
