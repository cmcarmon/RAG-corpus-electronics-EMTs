The fundamental result of the sampling theorem is, remarkably, that a bandlimited signal is uniquely speciﬁed
by its sufﬁciently close equally spaced samples. Indeed, the sampling theorem illustrates how the original signal
can be regained from knowledge of the samples and the sampling rate at which they were taken.
