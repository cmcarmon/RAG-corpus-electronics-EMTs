Equations  (73.52)  deﬁne  the  power  spectral  density  functions  (psdf’s)  SXX( f )  for  X(t)  and  SYY( f )  for Y(t).
Thus, RXX(t) and SXX( f ) are Fourier transform pairs, as are RYY(t) and SYY( f ) (see Eq. 73.20). Further, the psdf
SXX( f ) of X(t) is a power spectrum (in an average sense). If X(t) is the voltage dropped across a 1-W resistor,
then  X2(t)  is  the  instantaneous  power  dissipation  in  the  resistance.  Consequently,  RXX(0)  =  E[X2(t)]  is  the
expected power dissipation over all frequencies, i.e., by Eq. (73.54) with t = 0, we have
