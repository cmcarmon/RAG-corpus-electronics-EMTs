A different and more difﬁcult-to-use approach for generating test patterns for path-delay measurement is
to  perform  scan-in  to  load  the  internal  ﬂip-ﬂops  with  a  special  pattern  that  prior  circuit  analysis  will  have
determined will be transformed into the actually intended test pattern when the ﬁrst functional clock pulse is
