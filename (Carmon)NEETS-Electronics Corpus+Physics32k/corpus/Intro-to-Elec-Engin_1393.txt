used to connect some television antennas. The coaxial cable of Figure 15.1.1(b) is the most widely
used of the many possible cable-type transmission lines. For printed-circuit and integrated-circuit
applications, transmission lines sketched in Figures 15.1.1(c) through (f) are commonly employed.
At higher frequencies, when power levels are large and attenuation in transmission lines is
signiﬁcant, connections between system components are often made through waveguides, which
are usually hollow, closed, rigid conductor conﬁgurations (much like water pipes) through which
waves propagate. The most common waveguides are either rectangular or circular in cross
section, as depicted in Figure 15.1.2, but other shapes and ﬂexible varieties are also possible.
