A modem (modulator/demodulator) is an electronic device that takes digital data as a serial
stream of bits and produces a modulated carrier signal as an output. That is to say, the digital
signals are converted to an analog form with a relatively narrow bandwidth. The carrier signal is
then transmitted over the telephone line to a similar modem at the receiving end, where the carrier
signal is demodulated back into its original serial stream of bits, as shown in Figure 6.4.4. The
serial digital data to be transmitted are modulated, ﬁltered, and ampliﬁed for analog transmission;
the analog data received at the receiving end are ampliﬁed, ﬁltered, and demodulated to produce
serial digital signals.
