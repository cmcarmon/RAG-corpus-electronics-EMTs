use. Chapter 1 of this module contains information showing you how to measure circuit characteristics to
help determine the changes that can occur in them. Some of the changes in circuits can cause conditions
that are dangerous to the circuit itself or to people living or working near the circuits. These potentially
dangerous conditions require circuit protection. The conditions that require circuit protection are direct
shorts, excessive current, and excessive heat.
