To minimize coupling from the inevitable sources, all exposed elements are usually enclosed
within conducting shields, which offer low-resistance paths to ground. When held at a common
potential, these shields are quite effective in reducing most types of interference. However, low-
frequency magnetic coupling can induce unwanted current ï¬‚ow through the shields themselves.
Then the shield connection has to be interrupted to avoid a closed-loop current path. An additional
