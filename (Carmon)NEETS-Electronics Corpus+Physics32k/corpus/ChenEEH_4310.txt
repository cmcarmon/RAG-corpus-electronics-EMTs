Nonetheless, one can set up some equivalence classes on
feedback in circuits and systems. In one of these constructions,
it is possible to focus upon whether the feedback was intro-
duced deliberately by the designer, or whether it just happened
to be present in a circuit or system which was not designed
with any particular notion of feedback in mind. A great many
readers will likely identify with the ﬁrst of these two classes, in
which the feedback has been incorporated by speciﬁc choice,
with sensors and actuators and processors which transform
measurements into commands to achieve a given set of goals.
Indeed, this way of looking at things was apparent early in the
modern literature. Circuit persons will also recognize the
second class of possibilities, in as much as feedback in elec-
tronic ampliﬁers was being discussed almost at the same time
that the systems viewpoint was being put into place.
