Since multiplication–additions are important in DSP appli-
cations, the power requirements of an LNS and a linear ﬁxed-
point adder–multiplier have been compared. It has been
reported that approximately a two times reduction in power
dissipation is possible for operations with word sizes of 8 to 14
bits (Paliouras and Stouraitis, 2001). Given a sufﬁcient number
of consecutive multiplication–additions, the LNS implementa-
tion becomes more efﬁcient from the low-power dissipation
viewpoint, even when a constant conversion overhead is taken
into consideration.
