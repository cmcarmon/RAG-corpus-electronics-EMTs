An alternate derivation of the relationship between pulse chirp and GVD, which more immediately illustrates the reason why GVD can be defined by the derivative of inverse group velocity, can be outlined as follows. Consider two transform-limited pulses of carrier frequencies




ω

1




{\displaystyle \omega _{1}}
and




ω

2




{\displaystyle \omega _{2}}
, which are initially overlapping in time. After passing through the medium, these two pulses will exhibit a time delay between their respective pulse-envelope centers, given by

)

.


{\displaystyle \Delta T=d\left({\frac {1}{v_{g}(\omega _{2})}}-{\frac {1}{v_{g}(\omega _{1})}}\right).}

The expression can be approximated as a Taylor expansion, giving

{\displaystyle \Delta T=d\,\times \,{\textrm {GVD}}(\omega _{1})\,\times \,(\omega _{2}-\omega _{1}).}

From here it is possible to imagine scaling this expression up two pulses to infinitely many. The frequency difference
