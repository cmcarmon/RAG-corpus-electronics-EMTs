Both	an	electric	circuit	and	an	electronic	circuit	refer	to	a	complete	pathway	for
electric	current,	which	starts	and	ends	at	a	single	point;	it	is	a	passage	that	allows
the	electricity	to	enter	at	one	place,	then,	let	it	pass	through	a	series	of	stops,	and
finally,	leave	it	to	exit	at	the	same	place.	The	list	of	basic	examples	of	a	circuit
includes	a	light	switch	(off	and	on)	and	battery-operated	lamps.
