(above), and Deposits integrated-
circuit resistors (below). The image
on the bottom shows a small
region of the MAX807L micro-
processor supervisory circuit from
Maxim Integrated Products, and
depicts an array of silicon-
chromium thin-ﬁlm resistors, each
with 6 µm width and 217.5 µm
length, and nominal resistance
50 k. (Photograph Courtesy of
