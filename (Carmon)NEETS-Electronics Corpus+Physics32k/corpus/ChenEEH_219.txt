Analyzing nonlinear circuits is often difÔ¨Åcult. Only a few
simple circuits are adequately described by equations that have
a closed form solution. Contrary to linear circuits, which
consist of linear elements only (excluding the independent
current and voltage sources), nonlinear circuits may possess
multiple solutions or may not possess a solution at all (Will-
son, 1994). A trivial example is a circuit consisting of a current
source and an exponential diode, where the value of the dc
current supplied by the current source is more negative than
the asymptotic value of the current permitted by the diode
characteristic when the diode is reverse-biased. It is also pos-
sible to construct circuits employing the Ebers-Moll modeled
(Ebers and Moll, 1954) bipolar junction transistors whose dc
equations may have no solution (Willson, 1995).
