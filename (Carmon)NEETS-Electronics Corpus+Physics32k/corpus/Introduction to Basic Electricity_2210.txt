The  polarity  of  an  induced  voltage  can  be 
 determined by the following left-hand	rule	for	
	generators: The thumb, index finger, and mid-
dle finger are held at right angles to each other   
(Figure 18-13). The thumb points in the same direc-
tion as the  motion of the conductor, the index fin-
ger points in the direction of the flux lines (north 
to south), and the middle finger points toward the 
negative end of the conductor, the direction of the 
current flow.
