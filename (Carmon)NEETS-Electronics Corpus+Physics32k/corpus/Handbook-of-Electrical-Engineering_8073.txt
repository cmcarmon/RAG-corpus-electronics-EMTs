There are numerous multiprocessor architectures. An example architecture that is well suited to using large
numbers of microprocessors is the hypercube. The hypercube architecture was originally developed by Charles
Seitz and others at California Institute of Technology in the early 1980s. The hypercube depends on using large
numbers of commodity microprocessors, each with private memory, in a hypercube network [Bell, 1989].
