Two types of RAM are available: static and dynamic. 
static RAM (sRAM) uses a bistable circuit as the stor-
age element. It loses data when the power is removed. 
Dynamic RAM (DRAM) is different because it uses 
capacitors to store the data. The drawback is that the 
capacitors discharge over time and must be recharged 
or refreshed periodically to maintain the stored data. 
Even with the additional support circuit requirement, 
SRAMs are still cheaper and have a higher density, re-
ducing the circuit board area required.
