The other end of the spectrum is to store all the arrays in
different memories. This leads to a relatively high energy
consumption because then the external global interconnection
lines connecting all these (small) memories with each other
and with the data paths become an important contributor.
Likewise, the area occupied by the memory system increases,
due to the interconnections and the Ô¨Åxed address decoding
and other overhead per memory.
