The telemetry tracking and command (TT&C) subsystem receives data from the ground and enables functions
on the satellite to be activated by appropriate codes transmitted from the ground. This system operates with
low  data  rates  and  requires  omni-directional  antennas  to  maintain  ground  contact  in  the  event  the  satellite
loses its orientation.
