Time-delay fuses have a speciÔ¨Åed delay in their overload characteristics and are designed for motor circuits.
When started, motors typically draw six times their full load current for approximately 3 to 4 seconds. This
surge then decreases to a level within the motor full-load current rating. Time-delay fuse overload characteristics
are designed to allow for motor starting conditions.
