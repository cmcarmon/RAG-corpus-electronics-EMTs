The current depends on base doping and neutral base width.
The variation of the latter with the applied voltages vB0C0 and
vB0E0 is known as forward and reverse Early effect. In most
transistor models, mf > 1 is supposed to account for the
reverse Early effect (variation of wB with vB0E0 ), whereas the
vB0C0 dependence
such as
wB ¼ wB0(1 þ vB0C0=VEf ) with wB0 as neutral base width in
equilibrium and VEf as forward Early voltage.
At high-injection, a solution for iTf exists that is similar to
the one above, but with 2Dn and mf ¼ 2 rather than Dn and
