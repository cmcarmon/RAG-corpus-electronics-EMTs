Computer-aided design and analysis: The process of using computer assistance in the design and analysis
of complex systems. In our context, the design and analysis of communication systems, computer-aided
design and analysis often involves the extensive use of simulation techniques. Computer-aided techniques
often allow one to address design and analysis problems that are not tractable analytically.
