If a walk-regular graph admits perfect state transfer, then all of its eigenvalues are integers.
If



G


{\displaystyle G}
is a graph in a homogeneous coherent algebra that admits perfect state transfer at time



t


{\displaystyle t}
, such as e.g. a vertex-transitive graph or a graph in an association scheme, then all of the vertices on



G


{\displaystyle G}
admit perfect state transfer at time



t


{\displaystyle t}
. Moreover, a graph



G


{\displaystyle G}
must have a perfect matching that admits perfect state transfer if it admits perfect state transfer between a pair of adjacent vertices and is a graph in a homogeneous coherent algebra.
A regular edge-transitive graph



G


{\displaystyle G}
cannot admit perfect state transfer between a pair of adjacent vertices, unless it is a disjoint union of copies of the complete graph

A strongly regular graph admits perfect state transfer if and only if it is the complement of the disjoint union of an even number of copies of

The only cubic distance-regular graph that admits perfect state transfer is the cubical graph.
