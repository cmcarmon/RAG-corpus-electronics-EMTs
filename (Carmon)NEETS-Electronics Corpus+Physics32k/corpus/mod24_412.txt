Figure 4-20 shows how an expanded-beam connector uses two lenses to expand and then refocus the
light from the transmitting fiber into the receiving fiber. Expanded-beam connectors are normally plug-
adapter-plug type connections. Fiber separation and lateral misalignment are less critical in expanded-
beam coupling than in butt-jointing. The same amount of fiber separation and lateral misalignment in
expanded beam coupling produces a lower coupling loss than in butt-jointing. However, angular
misalignment is more critical. The same amount of angular misalignment in expanded-beam coupling
produces a higher loss than in butt-jointing. Expanded-beam connectors are also much harder to produce.
Present applications for expanded-beam connectors include multifiber connections, edge connections for
printed circuit boards, and other applications.
