Keeping up with alternating current (or not!)
When you apply an AC voltage to a circuit containing an inductor, the induc-
tor fights against any changes in the source current. If you keep varying the 
supply voltage up and down at a very high frequency, the inductor will keep 
opposing the sudden changes in current. At the extreme high end of the fre-
quency spectrum, no current flows at all because the inductor simply canâ€™t 
react quickly enough to the change in current.
