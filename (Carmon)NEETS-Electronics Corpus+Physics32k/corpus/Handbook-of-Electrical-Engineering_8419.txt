To separate the binary digits into groups of four (for BCH) or groups of three (for BCO), counting must
begin from the radix point and continue outward in both directions. Then, where needed, zeros are added to
the leading and trailing ends of the binary representation to complete the MSDs and LSDs for the BCH and
BCO forms.
