In engineering MRV can be applied to the following areas:
Analysis of technical flows in complex geometries (separation, recirculation zones)
Validation of numerical simulations in computational fluid dynamics using 3D velocity fields
Iterative design of complex inner flow channels (combined with rapid prototyping)
Measurement of concentration distributions in mixing processes
Analysis of flow through porous media
Interaction of immiscible fluids
