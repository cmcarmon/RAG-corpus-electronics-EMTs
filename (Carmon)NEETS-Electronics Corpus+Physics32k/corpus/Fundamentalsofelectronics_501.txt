(a) Find an expression for X (f ), the Fourier transform of the modulated signal.
(b) Sketch the magnitude of X (f ), being careful to label important magnitudes and frequencies.
(c) What demodulation technique obviously works?
(d) I.B. challenges three of his friends to demodulate x (t) some other way. One friend suggests modulating
