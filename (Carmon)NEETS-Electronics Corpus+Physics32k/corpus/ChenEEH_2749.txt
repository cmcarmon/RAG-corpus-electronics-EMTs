We now suspect that, for a given Nl, D~vvaniso is at most a
weak function of S and, therefore, is only weakly dependent on
Dt . In fact, this is the case. More generally, Y. Liu, (1996) has
shown that D~vvaniso is only weakly dependent on the speciﬁc
type of time-marching scheme used, whether leapfrog, Runge-
Kutta, or other schemes. Thus, we can say that D~vvaniso is
virtually an intrinsic characteristic of the space–lattice discre-
tization. Following Y. Liu (1996), three key points should be
made in this regard:
