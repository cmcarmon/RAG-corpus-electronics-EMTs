You will not likely see all these symptoms of shock in any one case. Some of them appear only in 
late stages of shock when the disturbance of the blood flow has become so great that the person's life is in 
serious danger. Sometimes the signs of shock may be disguised by other signs of injury. You must know 
what symptoms indicate the presence of shock, but do not ever wait for symptoms to develop before 
beginning the treatment for shock. Remember, EVERY SERIOUSLY INJURED PERSON IS 
LIKELY TO DEVELOP SERIOUS SHOCK.
