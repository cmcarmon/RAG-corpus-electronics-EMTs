The ammeter function of a multimeter (Figure 50-3) 
measures the current flow for the entire circuit or the 
flow through individual components. The ammeter 
must be inserted in the circuit in series and requires 
the removal of one lead of a component from the cir-
cuit. The ammeter is not the first piece of equipment 
to use in troubleshooting unless measuring the total 
current flow of the circuit.
