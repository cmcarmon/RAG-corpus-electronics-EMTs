SigniÔ¨Åcant progress has been made in recent years in discrete-data and digital control systems
because of the advances made in digital computers and microcomputers, as well as the advantages
found in working with digital signals. Discrete-data and digital control systems differ from the
continuous-data or analog systems in that the signals in one or more parts of these systems
are in the form of either a pulse train or a numerical (digital) code. The terms, sampled-data
systems, discrete-data systems, discrete-time systems, and digital systems have been loosely used
in the control literature. However, sampled-data systems usually refer to a general class of systems
whose signals are in the form of pulse data; sampled data refers to signals that are pulse-amplitude
modulated, i.e., trains of pulses with signal information carried by the amplitudes. Digital control
systems refers to the use of a digital computer or controller in the system; digital data usually
refers to signals that are generated by digital computers or digital transducers and are thus in
some kind of coded form. A practical system such as an industrial process control is generally
of such complexity that it contains analog and sampled as well as digital data. Hence the term
discrete-data systems is used in a broad sense to describe all systems in which some form of
digital or sampled signals occur. When a microprocessor receives and outputs digital data, the
system then becomes a typical discrete-data or digital control system.
