Once the prototype is built, it must be evaluated to 
determine whether it meets the needs of the problem 
identified. It has to be tested under a variety of condi-
tions that the final PCB and circuit will be exposed to. 
If it does not pass this stage, the solution goes back into 
the loop for redesigning by changing the circuit com-
ponent values or the circuit. Once the solution passes 
the testing and evaluating step and the documentation 
is complete, the prototype design process is done.
