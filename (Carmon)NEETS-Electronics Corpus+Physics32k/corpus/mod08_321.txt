When the input signal developed by R1 goes positive, the current through Q1 increases. This
increased current causes a positive-going signal at the top of R3. This signal is felt on the emitter of Q2.
Since the base of Q2 is grounded, the current through Q2 decreases with a positive-going signal on the
emitter. This decreased current causes less voltage drop across R4. Therefore, the voltage at the bottom of
R4 increases and a positive-going signal is felt at the output.
