A node  is  usually  indicated  by  a  dot  in  a  circuit.  If  a  short  circuit  (a
connecting  wire)  connects  two  nodes,  the  two  nodes  constitute  a  sin-
gle  node.  The  circuit  in  Fig.  2.10  has  three  nodes 
,  and  c.  Notice
that the three points that form node b are connected by perfectly con-
ducting wires and therefore constitute a single point. The same is true
of  the  four  points  forming  node  c. We  demonstrate  that  the  circuit  in
Fig.  2.10  has  only  three  nodes  by  redrawing  the  circuit  in  Fig.  2.11.
The two circuits in Figs. 2.10 and 2.11 are identical. However, for the
sake  of  clarity,  nodes  b and  c are  spread  out  with  perfect  conductors
as in Fig. 2.10.
