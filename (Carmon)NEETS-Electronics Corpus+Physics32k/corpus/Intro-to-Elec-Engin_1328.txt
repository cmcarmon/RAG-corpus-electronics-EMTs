Multiplexing Systems
A multiplexing system is one in which two or more signals are transmitted jointly over the
same transmission channel. There are two commonly used methods for signal multiplexing.
In frequency-division multiplexing (FDM), various signals are translated to nonoverlapping
frequency bands. The signals are demultiplexed for individual recovery by bandpass Ô¨Åltering
at the destination. FDM may be used with either analog or discrete signal transmission. Time-
division multiplexing (TDM), on the other hand, makes use of the fact that a sampled signal is
off most of the time and the intervals between samples are available for the insertion of samples
from other signals. TDM is usually employed in the transmission of discrete information. Let us
now describe basic FDM and TDM systems.
