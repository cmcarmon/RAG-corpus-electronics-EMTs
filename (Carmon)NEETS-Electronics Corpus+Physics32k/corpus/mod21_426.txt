In this method of measurement, a neon bulb or milliammeter is moved along the two-wire parallel
transmission line. Points of maximum voltage (standing-wave voltage peaks) with the lamp or points of
maximum current (standing-wave current peaks) with the indicator will have maximum brilliance or
indication, respectively.
