You can describe a transmission line in terms of its impedance. The ratio of voltage to current
(Ein/Iin) at the input end is known as the INPUT IMPEDANCE (Zin). This is the impedance presented to
the transmitter by the transmission line and its load, the antenna. The ratio of voltage to current at the
output (Eout/Iout) end is known as the OUTPUT IMPEDANCE (Zout). This is the impedance presented to
the load by the transmission line and its source. If an infinitely long transmission line could be used, the
ratio of voltage to current at any point on that transmission line would be some particular value of
impedance. This impedance is known as the CHARACTERISTIC IMPEDANCE.
