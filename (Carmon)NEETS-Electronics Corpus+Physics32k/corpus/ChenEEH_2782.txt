exists 2p (or equivalently, 0) phase shift of the unstable mode
between adjacent observation points along the f Â¼ 45 cut.
Adjacent Ez values along f Â¼ 45 cannot change sign. In
contrast, equation 9.86 reduces to ~kk Â¼ p=D, (i.e., ~ll Â¼ 2D)
for the unstable mode along the f Â¼ 0, 90 cuts. Therefore,
there is p phase shift of the unstable mode between adjacent
observation points along f Â¼ 0, 90, yielding the point-by-
point sign reversals (rapid spatial oscillations) seen in Figure
9.12(B).
