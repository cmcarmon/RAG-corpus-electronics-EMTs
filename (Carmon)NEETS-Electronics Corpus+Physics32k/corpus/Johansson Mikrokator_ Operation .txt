The instrument is initially calibrated to the standard, and the zero is set to this value. Then, the test specimen are placed on the measuring table and are slid below the plunger of the instrument. Any difference in the measured dimension of the specimen will result in either the lowering or rising of the plunger. The lowering or rising of plunger will make the bell crank lever to move in forward or backward direction, and in turn, will twist or untwist the metallic strip.the centre line of strip is perforated in order to prevent excessive stress.
