Many  tools  that  produce  sliceable  ﬂoorplans  are  still  in  use  because  of  their
simplicity. In particular, many problems arising in sliceable ﬂoorplanning are solv-
able optimally in polynomial time [Sarrafzadeh and Wong, 1996]. Unfortunately,
sliceable ﬂoorplans are rarely optimal (in terms of their area), and they often result
in  layouts  with  very  difﬁcult  routing  phases.  (Routing  is  discussed  later  in  this
section.) Figure 25.11 shows a compact ﬂoorplan that is not sliceable.
