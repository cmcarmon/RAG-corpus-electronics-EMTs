Voice  and  text  are  no  longer  sufﬁcient  for  business  customers.  In  the  ofﬁces  and  factories  of  tomorrow,
interactive broadband services will be required. Handling complex tasks in the future demands comprehensive
support by services for voice, text, data, graphics, video, and documents. In addition to the individual services,
the multimedia services and the simultaneous or alternating use of several services with multifunction work-
stations will gain importance [Armbrüster, 1990].
