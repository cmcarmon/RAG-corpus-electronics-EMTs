Boiling-Water Reactor
In the BWR shown in Fig. 59.8(B), the pressure is low, about 1000 psi. The nuclear reaction heats the water
(cid:176)
F. The remaining water is recirculated and mixed
directly to evaporate it and produce wet steam at about 545
with feedwater. The steam drives a turbine that typically rotates at 1800 rpm. The rest of the plant is similar
to a conventional power plant. A typical reactor arrangement is shown in Fig. 59.9. The Ô¨Ågure shows all the
major  components  of  a  reactor.  The  fuel  and  control  rod  assembly  is  located  in  the  lower  part.  The  steam
separators are above the core, and the steam dryers are at the top of the reactor. The reactor is enclosed by a
concrete dome.
