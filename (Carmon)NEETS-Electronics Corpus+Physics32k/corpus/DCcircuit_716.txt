One thing to be aware of when sizing ammeter shunt resistors is the factor of power dis-
sipation. Unlike the voltmeter, an ammeterâ€™s range resistors have to carry large amounts of
current. If those shunt resistors are not sized accordingly, they may overheat and suffer dam-
age, or at the very least lose accuracy due to overheating. For the example meter above, the
