Instead of using two transmitter frequencies, you can find the range by sweeping the transmitter
frequency uniformly in time to cover the frequency range from f1 to f2. The beat, or difference, frequency
between the transmitted and received signals is then a function of range. In this type of radar, the velocity
as well as range is measured.
