Practical investigation  
 
Objective 
 
To 
investigate 
semiconductor 
interface/signal conditioning circuit. 
 
Components and test equipment 
Breadboard, d.c. power supply with ± 5 V output at 
100  mA  (or  more),  10  kD linear  variable  resistor  
(preferably  multi-turn  type),  fixed  resistors  of  
10  kD (two  required)  and  100  kD 0.25  W  5%, 
AD590  temperature  sensor,  TL081  operational 
amplifier,  digital  multimeter,  thermometer,  test 
leads and probes, small hand-held hair drier. 
 
Procedure 
 
Connect  the  circuit,  set  VR1  to  mid-position,  and 
measure the output voltage produced by the circuit. 
Adjust  VR1  for  an  output  voltage  reading  of 
exactly  zero  at  a  temperature  of  20°C.  Place  the
