The Minister moved the second reading of the Accident Towing Services on 19 April 2007. The Minister set the context for the Bill in his speech in support as follows -

"The Government has reviewed the existing towing services framework a number of times in recent years and has concluded that retaining the existing regulatory framework is essential to address the unique problems in the industry and to protect accident victims and benefit road users. The reviews involved extensive consultation with stakeholders. Also, over the last two years there has been ongoing consultation with industry stakeholders on a proposal for an improved regulatory framework for the industry and a new stand-alone accident towing services statute. ....the Government is committed to retaining the existing regulatory framework, which has been effective for over 20 years. Therefore, the substantive provisions of the ... Transport Act 1983 relating to accident towing are largely retained by the Bill, but in an improved and modernised form."
