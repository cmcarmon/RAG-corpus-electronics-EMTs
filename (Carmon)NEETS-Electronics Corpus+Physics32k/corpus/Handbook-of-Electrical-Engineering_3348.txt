In integrated optic devices, the optical channel waveguides are formed on a thin, planar, optically polished
substrate using photolithographic techniques similar to those used in the semiconductor IC industry. Waveguide
routing  is  accomplished  by  the  mask  used  in  the  photolithographic  process,  similar  to  the  way  electrically
conductive paths are deﬁned in semiconductor ICs. The photolithographic nature of device fabrication offers
the potential of readily scaling the technology to large volumes, as is done in the semiconductor IC industry.
For example, the typical device is 0.75 in. · 0.078 in. in size. Dividing the substrate size by the typical device
size and assuming a 50% area usage indicates that one can achieve 50 devices per 3-in. wafer.
