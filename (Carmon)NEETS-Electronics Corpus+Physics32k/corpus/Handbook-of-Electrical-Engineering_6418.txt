Linear Receivers
When the channel does not introduce any amplitude distortion, the linear receiver is optimum with respect to
the ultimate criterion of minimum probability of symbol error. The  conventional linear receiver consists of a
matched ﬁlter, a symbol-rate sampler, an inﬁnite-length T-spaced equalizer, and a memoryless detector. The
linear receiver structure is shown in Fig. 70.10.
