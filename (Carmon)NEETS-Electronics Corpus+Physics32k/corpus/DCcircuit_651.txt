Unfortunately, the force generated by the electrostatic attraction is very small for common
voltages. In fact, it is so small that such meter movement designs are impractical for use in
general test instruments. Typically, electrostatic meter movements are used for measuring
very high voltages (many thousands of volts). One great advantage of the electrostatic meter
movement, however, is the fact that it has extremely high resistance, whereas electromagnetic
movements (which depend on the ﬂow of electrons through wire to generate a magnetic ﬁeld)
are much lower in resistance. As we will see in greater detail to come, greater resistance
(resulting in less current drawn from the circuit under test) makes for a better voltmeter.
