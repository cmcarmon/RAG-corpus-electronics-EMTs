An arbitrary real-valued signal s(t) can be expressed as a sum of even and odd components, s(t) = seven(t) +
sodd(t), where seven(t) = seven(–t) and sodd(t) = –sodd(–t), and where seven(t) = [s(t) + s(–t)]/2 and sodd(t) = [s(t)
– s(–t)]/2 . For the trigonometric Fourier series, it can be shown that seven(t) is represented by the (even) cosine
terms in the inﬁnite series, sodd(t) is represented by the (odd) sine terms, and b0 is the dc level of the signal.
Therefore, if it can be determined by inspection that a signal has a dc level, or if it is even or odd, then the
correct form of the trigonometric series can be chosen to simplify the analysis. For example, it is easily seen
that the signal shown in Fig. 14.3 is an even signal with a zero dc level. Therefore, it can be accurately represented
by the cosine series with bn = 2A sin(pn/2)/(pn/2), n = 1, 2, …, as illustrated in Fig. 14.4. In contrast, note that
the  sawtooth  waveform  used  in  the  previous  example  is  an  odd  signal  with  zero  dc  level,  so  that  it  can  be
completely speciﬁed by the sine terms of the trigonometric series. This result can be demonstrated by pairing
each positive frequency component from the exponential series with its conjugate partner; i.e., cn = sin(nwot)
=  ane jnwot +  a–ne –jnwot,  whereby  it  is  found  that  cn  =  2A  cos(np)/(np)  for  this  example.  In  general,  it  is  found
that an = (bn – jcn)/2 for n = 1, 2, …, a0 = b0, and a–n = an*. The trigonometric Fourier series is common in the
signal processing literature because it replaces complex coefﬁcients with real ones and often results in a simpler
and more intuitive interpretation of the results.
