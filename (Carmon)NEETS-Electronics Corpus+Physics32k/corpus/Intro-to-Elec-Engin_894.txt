EXAMPLE 11.2.1
Consider the magnetic circuit of Figure 11.2.1(b) with an air gap, while neglecting leakage ﬂux.
Correct for fringing by adding the length of the air gap lg = 0.1 mm to each of the other two
dimensions of the core cross section AC = 2.5cm × 2.5cm. The mean length of the magnetic
path in the core lC is given to be 10 cm. The core is made of 0.15- mm-thick laminations of M-19
material whose magnetization characteristic is given in Figure 11.1.2. Assume the stacking factor
to be 0.9. Determine the current in the exciting winding, which has 100 turns and produces a core
ﬂux of 0.625 mWb.
