To start external cardiac compression, place the victim on the back, establish an open airway, and 
kneel at right angles to the victim's body. Then locate the victim's sternum (breastbone). You have a 
choice of two methods of doing this. One method is to bare the chest and locate the sternum by drawing 
an imaginary line from one nipple to the other to identify the proper area of the sternum, which is 
darkened in figure 1-2. The other method is to locate the lower tip of the sternum with the index and 
middle fingers, placing the heels of your hands above your fingers in the darkened area.
