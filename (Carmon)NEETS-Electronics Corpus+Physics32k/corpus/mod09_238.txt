The Q (discussed in chapter 1) of a crystal is many times greater than that of an LC tank circuit. The 
high Q is present because the resistance in the crystal is extremely small. Commercially produced crystals 
range in Q from 5,000 to 30,000. The high Q causes the frequency stability to be much greater than that 
of an ordinary LC tank circuit. This is the reason a crystal is used in many sine-wave generator circuits.
