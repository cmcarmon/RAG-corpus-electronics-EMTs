Couples are very important in mechanical engineering and the physical sciences. A few examples are:
The forces exerted by one's hand on a screw-driver
The forces exerted by the tip of a screw-driver on the head of a screw
Drag forces acting on a spinning propeller
Forces on an electric dipole in a uniform electric field.
The reaction control system on a spacecraft.
Force exerted by hands on steering wheel.
In a liquid crystal it is the rotation of an optic axis called the director that produces the functionality of these compounds. As Jerald Ericksen explained
At first glance, it may seem that it is optics or electronics which is involved, rather than mechanics. Actually, the changes in optical behavior, etc. are associated with changes in orientation. In turn, these are produced by couples. Very roughly, it is similar to bending a wire, by applying couples.
