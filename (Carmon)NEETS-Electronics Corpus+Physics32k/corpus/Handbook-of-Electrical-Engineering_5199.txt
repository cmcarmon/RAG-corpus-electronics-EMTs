Pyrosensitive smart materials: Materials that self-adaptively (smartly) manage the electromagnetic surface
characteristics  of  active  surfaces  constituted  by  pyrosensitive  inclusions,  in  response  to  an  external
temperature-inducing stimulus applied per the feedback information on electromagnetic characteristics.
