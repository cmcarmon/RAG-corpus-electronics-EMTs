Phototransistors
For bipolar devices the light generates carriers which inject current into the base of the transistor. This modulates
the collector base current, providing a higher output signal. For a Ô¨Åeld effect device the light generates carriers
which create a gate voltage. PhotoFETs can have very high sensitivities.
