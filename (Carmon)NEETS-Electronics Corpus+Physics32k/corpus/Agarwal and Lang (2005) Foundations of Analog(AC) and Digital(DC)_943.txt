We saw in the previous section that when the gate voltage of the MOSFET
is greater than the threshold voltage, and the drain voltage is greater than the
gate voltage minus one threshold drop (vDS ≥ vGS − VT), a voltage-controlled
current source model is appropriate for the MOSFET. The switch-current source
