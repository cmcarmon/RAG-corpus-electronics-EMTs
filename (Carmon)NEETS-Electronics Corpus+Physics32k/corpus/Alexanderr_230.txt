Electronic  instruments  are  used  in  all  ﬁelds  of  science  and  engi-
neering. They have proliferated in science and technology to the extent
that  it  would  be  ridiculous  to  have  a  scientiﬁc  or  technical  education
without  exposure  to  electronic  instruments.  For  example,  physicists,
physiologists,  chemists,  and  biologists  must  learn  to  use  electronic
instruments.  For  electrical  engineering  students  in  particular,  the  skill
in  operating  digital  and  analog  electronic  instruments  is  crucial.  Such
instruments  include  ammeters,  voltmeters,  ohmmeters,  oscilloscopes,
spectrum analyzers, and signal generators.
