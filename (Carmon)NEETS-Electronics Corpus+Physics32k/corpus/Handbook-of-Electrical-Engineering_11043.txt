Traumatic  epilepsy  results  from  injury  to  the  brain.  It  is  believed  that  contraction  of  scar  tissue  acts  as  a
stimulus to adjacent nerve cells which discharge rhythmically, the excitation spreading to a grand mal convul-
sion. The EEG provides information on the origin of the abnormal discharge.
