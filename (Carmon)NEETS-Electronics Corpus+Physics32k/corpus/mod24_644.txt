Understanding optical emission in semiconductor lasers and LEDs requires knowledge of
semiconductor material and device properties. Providing a complete description of semiconductor
properties is beyond the scope of this introductory manual. In this chapter we only discuss the general
properties of semiconductor LEDs and LDs.
