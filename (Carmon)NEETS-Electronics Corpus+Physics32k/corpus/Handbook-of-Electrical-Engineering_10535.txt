Decisions on which information to capture, how often to sample, and how many samples to preserve are
ideally based on what will be most valuable for troubleshooting existing faults and predicting future failures.
A  thorough  understanding  of  each  intelligent  subsystem  is  needed  in  addition  to  an  understanding  of  the
environment in which it operates, including the other subsystems with which it interacts. It is also important
to know what level of skill will be applied to interpreting the saved information. If the level of skill will be low,
some degree of artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence can be designed into the diagnostics to guide a maintenance technician
through the troubleshooting process.
