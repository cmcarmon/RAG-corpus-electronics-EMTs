Edge Detection
The ability to ﬁnd gray level edge structures in images is an important image processing operation. We shall
deﬁne  an  edge  to  be  regions  in  the  image  where  there  is  a  large  change  in  gray  level  over  a  relatively  small
spatial region. The process of ﬁnding edge locations in digital images is known as edge detection. Most edge
detection  operators,  also  known  as  edge  operators,  use  a  window  operator  to  ﬁrst  enhance  the  edges  in  the
image, followed by thresholding the enhanced image.
