Based on predicate logic, probability theory, and fuzzy sets,
rule-based expert systems are the most common type of expert
systems. Rule-based expert systems use if-then rules (or pro-
duction rules) to represent human expert knowledge, which is
often a mix of theoretical knowledge, heuristics derived from
experience, and special-purpose rules for dealing with abnor-
mal situations. A production system is an example of rule-
based systems: its knowledge base is a rule set, its inference
engine is a rule interpreter that decides when to apply which
rules, and its working memory contains the data that are
examined and modiÔ¨Åed in the inference process. The rules
are triggered by the data, and the rule interpreter controls the
selection of the rules and updating of the data.
