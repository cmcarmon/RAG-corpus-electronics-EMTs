A reply is a statement or acknowledgment made in response to an interrogative question, request or comment. Replies are communicated in a variety of ways, the most common being spoken or written, and act as a way of conveying relevant information and continuing a conversational exchange.
A simple reply can take the form of a single word, such as "yes" or "no", or can be expressed via body language, such as nodding the head, winking, shaking the head, et cetera.
