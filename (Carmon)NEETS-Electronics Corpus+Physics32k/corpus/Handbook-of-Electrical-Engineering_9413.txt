ATM LANs can support a relatively small number of users at high data access rates (low megabit per second).
Although  ATM  is  good  at  handling  mixed  media  trafÔ¨Åc  at  high  speeds,  it  remains  to  be  seen  if  enough
applications are developed requiring its high-bandwidth capability to make it a success. The cost effectiveness
of ATM technology is another issue awaiting resolution.
