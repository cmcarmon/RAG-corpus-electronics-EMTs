The next level of detail is the representation of the points
where the components merge, shown in Figure 9.2 as busses.
A good example of such a point is a substation where a number
of lines may come together, and a transformation of the volt-
age level may also take place. Figure 9.3 shows a one-line
representation of a substation.
