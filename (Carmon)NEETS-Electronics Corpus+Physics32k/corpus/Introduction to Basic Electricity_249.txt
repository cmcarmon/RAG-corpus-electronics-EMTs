EDA,	also	known	as	Electronic	Design	Automation	is	a	class	of	software
equipment	especially	for	designing	a	circuit	or	different	electronic	devices.	It	is
categorized	along	with	other	modern	tools	used	in	circuitry;	it	eliminates	the	need
to	design	a	circuit	by	hand,	which	minimizes	simple	and	critical	errors,	repair
glitches,	and	suggest	possible	improvements.
Moreover,	it’s	due	to	EDA	that	circuit	creation	and	circuit	production	became
faster.	If	you’re	concerned	regarding	the	quality	since	the	process	is	done	in	an
automated	fashion,	be	confident	that	each	design	underwent	thorough	analysis.
Remember,	the	software	equipment’s	design	was	specifically	meant	to	address	a
circuit’s	system.
