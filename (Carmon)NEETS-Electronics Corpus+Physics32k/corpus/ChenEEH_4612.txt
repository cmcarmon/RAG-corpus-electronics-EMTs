Thus, the diagnostic result will suggest an unanticipated situ-
ation. However, after the effect resulting from unexpected
noises decays, the fault-detection scheme discovers that the
system behavior is as normal as it is under the nominal
situation. After double checking that this situation, the fault-
detection scheme ï¬‚ags a false alarm signal, and the system
status is switched back to the nominal condition. Figure 8.19
shows some slight deviations of the system output away from
the desired trajectory during the periods of noisy data, which is
apparently caused by the fact that the contaminated measure-
ments are used directly in the fault-detection scheme and in
the unanticipated failure conditions as the learning targets for
failure accommodation.
