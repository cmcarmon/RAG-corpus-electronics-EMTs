Some of the technology-speciﬁc aspects of computer engineering were covered in Section VIII. This section,
however,  is  concerned  with  higher-level  aspects  which  are  substantially  independent  of  circuit  technology.
Chapter  86  reviews  organizational  matters  which  particularly  affect  computer  processor  design,  such  as  the
arithmetic and logical functions required. The next chapter considers the major topic of programming, which
may be different in each “layer,” using the previous analogy. Programming too has long been dominated by a
model, in which the programmer expresses an algorithm, i.e., a
particular paradigm, the so-called 
process for solving a problem, as a sequence of instructions—either simple or complex, depending on the type
declar-
of programming required. Recently others have emerged, such as rule-based programming, which has a 
model, i.e., the user speciﬁes the facts and rules of a situation and poses a question, leaving the computer
ative 
(“knowledge-engine”) to make its own inferences en route to ﬁnding a solution or set of solutions.
