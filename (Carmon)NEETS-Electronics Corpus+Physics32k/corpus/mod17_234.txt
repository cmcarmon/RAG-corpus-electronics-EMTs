CIRCUITRY.â€”Figure 2-15 is a block diagram representing agc feedback to preceding stages. The
detector circuit has a dc component in the output that is directly proportional to the average amplitude of
the modulated carrier. The agc circuitry uses this dc component by filtering the detector output to remove
the audio and IF components and by applying a portion of the dc component to the preceding stages. This
agc voltage controls the amplification of any or all of the stages preceding the detector stage. Solid-state
receivers may use either positive or negative voltage for agc. The type of transistors used and the
elements to which the control voltage is applied determine which type we will have.
