The muscle-up begins with the arms extended above the head, gripping a hold in the overhand pull-up position. The hold is usually on a chin-up bar or gymnastic rings.
The body is then explosively pulled up by the arms in a radial pull-up, with greater speed than a regular pull-up. When the bar approaches the upper chest, the wrists are swiftly flexed to bring the forearms above the bar. The body is leaned forward, and the elbows are straightened by activating the triceps. The routine is considered complete when the bar is at the level of the waist and the arms are fully straight.
To dismount, the arms are bent at the elbow, and the body is lowered to the floor, and the exercise can be repeated.
As a relatively advanced exercise, muscle-ups are typically first learned with an assistive kip. The legs swing (kip) up and provide momentum to assist in the explosive upward force needed to ascend above the bar. The strict variation of the muscle-up begins with a dead hang (or by standing still if the person's feet can touch the ground) and uses isometric muscle contractions to slowly ascend above the bar, without any kip.
