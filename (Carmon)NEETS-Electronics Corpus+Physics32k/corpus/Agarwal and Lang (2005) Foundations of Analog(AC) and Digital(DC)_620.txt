Consider the circuit in Figure 4.28 containing the hypothetical nonlinear device from
Example 4.11 (shown in Figure 4.26a) and two independent sources. Suppose we are
asked to determine the value of vB. The presence of the nonlinear device does not
allow the application of superposition, since superposition relies on the assumption of
linearity.
