Combinations of Data and Signals
There are four possible combinations of data and signals. For
each combination, this discussion provides examples of ap-
plications and techniques to encode data. Note that a digital
transmission system can use each of the four combinations for
its applications, but an analog transmission system can only use
an analog signal to carry either digital data or analog data.
