p r o b l e m 5.1 Derive a truth table and a boolean expression that describes the
operation of each digital circuit shown in Figure 5.34.
p r o b l e m 5.2 Draw an output voltage waveform for the circuit in Figure 5.34c
in response to the input voltage waveforms shown in Figure 5.35. Assume that the gates
in the circuit obey the static discipline with VOH = 4 V, VIH = 3 V, VOL = 1 V, and
VIL = 2 V.
