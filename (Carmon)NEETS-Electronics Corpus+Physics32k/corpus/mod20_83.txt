CAPACITOR-START MOTORÂ—A type of single-phase, ac induction motor in which a starting winding 
and a capacitor are placed in series to start the motor. The values of XC and R are such that the 
main-winding and starting-winding currents are nearly 90 degrees apart and the starting torque is 
produced as in a two-phase motor [5].
