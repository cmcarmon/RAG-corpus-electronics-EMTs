The time that is required to gather at least one sample of each message is known as a frame,
which is Ts, as shown in Figure 15.3.9(d). Now, with a single composite source of the waveform
shown in Figure 15.3.9(d) at point A of Figure 15.3.9(a), the time multiplexer of Figure 15.3.9(a)
operates beyond A. For Nb-bit encoding, each time slot in the output PCM signal will have Nb bits
of duration,
