The SHOR paradigm has important advantages. First, it is generally applicable to all military echelon levels.
Second, it represents a control process with its explicit dynamics rather than a relational or physical intercon-
nection of system components. Finally, it puts focus on the roles of controlling and decisionmaking without a
pre-bias on whether that function should be performed by humans or computers. The remaining challenge is
to  be  able  to  describe  both  human  and  computer  performance  with  a  common  type  of  representational
framework.
