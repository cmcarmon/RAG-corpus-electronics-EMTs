The basic principle can be described as the expression for mechanical work



W
=


F
→


⋅
Δ


r
→




{\displaystyle W={\overrightarrow {F}}\cdot \Delta {\overrightarrow {r}}}

since an actuator is to manipulate positions and therefore force is needed. For different kind of microactuators, different physical principles are applied.
