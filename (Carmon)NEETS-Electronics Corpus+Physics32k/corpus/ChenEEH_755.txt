The model for the memory bandwidth requirement is that
of a conﬂict graph. It is derived from the ordering of the
memory accesses, as shown in Figure 2.22. Its nodes represent
the application’s arrays, while its edges indicate that two arrays
are accessed in parallel. It models the constraints on the
memory architecture (see Subsection 2.6.4). An example is
