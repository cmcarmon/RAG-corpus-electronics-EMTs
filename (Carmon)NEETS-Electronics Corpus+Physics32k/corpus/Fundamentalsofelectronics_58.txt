amplitude as a complex number in polar form, its magnitude is the amplitude A and its angle the signal phase.
The complex amplitude is also known as a phasor. The complex exponential cannot be further decomposed
into more elemental signals, and is the most important signal in electrical engineering! Mathematical
manipulations at ﬁrst appear to be more diﬃcult because complex-valued numbers are introduced. In fact,
early in the twentieth century, mathematicians thought engineers would not be suﬃciently sophisticated
to handle complex exponentials even though they greatly simpliﬁed solving circuit problems. Steinmetz 5
introduced complex exponentials to electrical engineering, and demonstrated that “mere” engineers could use
them to good eﬀect and even obtain right answers! See Section 2.1 for a review of complex numbers and
complex arithmetic.
