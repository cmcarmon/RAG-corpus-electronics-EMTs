Voice communication systems are susceptible to interfering signals normally referred to as noise. The interfering
signals may have harmful effects on the performance of any speech communication system. These effects depend
on the speciÔ¨Åc system being used, on the nature of the noise and the way it interacts with the clean signal, and
on the relative intensity of the noise compared to that of the signal. The latter is usually measured by the signal-
to-noise ratio (SNR), which is the ratio of the power of the signal to the power of the noise.
