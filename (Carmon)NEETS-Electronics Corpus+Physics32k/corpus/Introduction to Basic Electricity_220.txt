Project	#	7	–	The	LED	with	Activated	Light
The	LED	with	Activated	Light	is	a	basic	project	for	beginners	in	circuit
engineering;	it	is	meant	for	a	clearer	understanding	of	the	concept	of
resistance.	The	LED	lights	up	with	the	application	of	sufficient	resistance;
if	resistance	levels	are	insufficient,	the	light	won’t	be	activated.
