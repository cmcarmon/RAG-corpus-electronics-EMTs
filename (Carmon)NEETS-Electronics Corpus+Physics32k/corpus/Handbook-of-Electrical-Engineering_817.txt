The Lyapunov function can be interpreted as the generalization of the energy function in electrical systems.
The Ô¨Årst requirement simply means that the graph of V has no discontinuities. The second requirement means
that  the  graph  of V  has  its  lowest  point  at  the  equilibrium,  and  the  third  requirement  generalizes  the  well-
known  fact  of  electrical  systems,  that  the  energy  in  a  free  electrical  system  with  resistance  always  decreases,
unless the system is at rest.
