Launch conditions significantly affect the results of multimode fiber attenuation measurements. If
the fiber is underfilled, high-order-mode power loss has minimal effect on the measurement results. If too
much power is launched into high-order modes, the high-order-mode power loss will dominate the
attenuation results. Generally, fiber attenuation measurements are performed using an underfilled launch
