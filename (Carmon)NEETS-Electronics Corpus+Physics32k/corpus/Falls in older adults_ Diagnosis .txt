When assessing a person who has fallen, it is important to try to get an eyewitness account of the incident. As the faller may have had some loss of consciousness, they may not give an accurate description of the fall. However, in practice, these eyewitness accounts are often unavailable. It is also important to remember than 30% of cognitively intact older people are unable to remember a documented fall three months later. Important points of inquiry:
Visual motor reaction time
Frequency of falls
Effectiveness of "parachute" corrective response of moving hand and arm to "break" the fall
Eyewitness account
Associated features
Risk factors for falling
legal and illegal drug interactions
Sedative and alcohol consumption
Assessment of proper, safe use of cane or walker assistive device
