For 7 or 8 players, Schurig builds a table with



n

/

2


{\displaystyle n/2}
vertical rows and



n
âˆ’
1


{\displaystyle n-1}
horizontal rows, as follows:
Then a second table is constructed (with counting from the end) as shown below:
By merging above tables we arrive at:
Then the first column is updated: if



n


{\displaystyle n}
is even, player number



n


{\displaystyle n}
is alternatingly substituted for the first and second positions, whereas if



n


{\displaystyle n}
is odd a bye is used instead.
The pairing tables were published as an annex concerning the arrangements for the holding of master tournaments. Schurig did not provide a proof nor a motivation for his algorithm. For more historical details, see Ahrens.
