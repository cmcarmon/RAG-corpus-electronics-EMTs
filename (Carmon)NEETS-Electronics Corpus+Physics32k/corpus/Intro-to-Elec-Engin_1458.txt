The signal and noise components, particularly at low SNRs, are so intermingled that one
may not be able to distinguish the signal from the noise. In such a case, a mutilation or threshold
effect is said to be present. There exists a speciﬁc SNR at the input of the demodulator known as
the threshold SNR, beyond which signal mutilation occurs. The threshold effect then places an
upper limit on the tradeoff between bandwidth and power in an FM system. Since the thresholds
for locked loops are lower than for the discriminator, loop-type receivers, operating at smaller
signal-power levels, ﬁnd wide application in space communications where transmitter power is
at a premium.
