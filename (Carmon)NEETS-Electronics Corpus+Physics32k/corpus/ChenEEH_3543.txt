The discrete-time Fourier transform (DTFT) was deﬁned a
complex series for an arbitrary discrete-time signal. The issue
of its convergence is brieﬂy examined. In the description here,
a sufﬁcient condition for the existence of DTFT is assumed.
This is done by considering the signal x[n] to be absolutely
summable (i.e.,
