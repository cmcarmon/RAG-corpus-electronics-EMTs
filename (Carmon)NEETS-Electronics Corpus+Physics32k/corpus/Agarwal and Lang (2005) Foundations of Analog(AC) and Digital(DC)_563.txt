For the circuit shown in Figure 3.116, write a complete set of
node equations for the voltages va, vb, and vc. Use conductance instead of resistance.
Simplify the equations by collecting terms and arranging them in the ‘‘standard’’ form
for n linear equations in n unknowns. (Do not solve the equations.)
