From Eq. (88.1) we see that a decrease in the latency will result in an increase in bandwidth, and vice versa, if
R
L
 does not increase
proportionately. For example, we can build a memory system that takes 20 ns to service the access of a single
32-bit word. Its latency is 20 ns per 32-bit word, and its bandwidth is
