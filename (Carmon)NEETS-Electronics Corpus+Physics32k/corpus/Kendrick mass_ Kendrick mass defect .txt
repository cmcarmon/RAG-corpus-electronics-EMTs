The Kendrick mass defect is defined as the exact Kendrick mass subtracted from the nominal (integer) Kendrick mass:






Kendrick~mass~defect


=


nominal~Kendrick~mass


−


Kendrick~mass




{\displaystyle {\textrm {Kendrick~mass~defect}}={\textrm {nominal~Kendrick~mass}}-{\textrm {Kendrick~mass}}}

In recent years the equation has changed due to rounding errors to:






Kendrick~mass~defect


=


nominal~mass


−


Kendrick~exact~mass




{\displaystyle {\textrm {Kendrick~mass~defect}}={\textrm {nominal~mass}}-{\textrm {Kendrick~exact~mass}}}

The members of an alkylation series have the same degree of unsaturation and number of heteroatoms (nitrogen, oxygen and sulfur) but differ in the number of CH2 units. Members of an alkylation series have the same Kendrick mass defect.
The Kendrick mass defect has also been defined as






Kendrick~mass~defect


=
(


nominal~Kendrick~mass


−


Kendrick~mass


)
×
1,000


{\displaystyle {\textrm {Kendrick~mass~defect}}=({\textrm {nominal~Kendrick~mass}}-{\textrm {Kendrick~mass}})\times 1{,}000}
.
The abbreviations KM and KMD have been used for Kendrick mass and Kendrick mass defect, respectively.
