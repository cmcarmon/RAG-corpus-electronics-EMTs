a b s o r b e d b y a b a t t e r y In simple circuits, for example, circuits con-
taining a single battery, we do not have to undergo the rigor of associated variables
to determine whether power is being absorbed or supplied by an element. Let us work
out such an example. In our lightbulb circuit of Figure 1.4b, suppose that the battery
is rated at 1.5 V and 1500 J. Assume that the internal resistance of the battery is zero.
Further assume that the resistance of the bulb is R = 10 . What is the power dissipated
in the resistor?
