Any of the three basic amplifier configurations (common collector, common base, or common 
emitter) described in NEETS, Module 7, Introduction to Solid-State Devices and Power Supplies, Chapter 
2, may be used for the oscillator circuit. However, certain considerations in the application of the circuit, 
such as the operating frequency and output power required, usually determine which of the three 
configurations is to be used. The three basic configurations are shown in figure 2-8, views (A), (B), and 
(C).
