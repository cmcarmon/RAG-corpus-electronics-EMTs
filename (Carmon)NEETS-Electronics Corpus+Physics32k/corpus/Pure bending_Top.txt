Pure bending is a condition of stress where a bending moment is applied to a beam without the simultaneous presence of axial, shear, or torsional forces. Pure bending occurs only under a constant bending moment (M) since the shear force (V), which is equal to

, has to be equal to zero. In reality, this state of pure bending does not practically exist, because such a state needs an absolutely weightless member. The state of pure bending is an approximation made to derive formulas.
