where R0 is the zero-strain resistance, that is, the resistance of the strain gauge under no strain.
A typical gauge has R0 = 350  and G = 2. Then for a strain of 1%, the change in resistance is
R = 7 . A Wheatstone bridge as presented in Section 1.4 is usually employed to measure the
small resistance changes associated with precise strain determination.
