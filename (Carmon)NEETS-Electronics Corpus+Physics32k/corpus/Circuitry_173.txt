thus 
 
i = 0.5 × 0.33 = 0.165 A 
 
In order to simplify the mathematics of exponential 
growth and decay, Table 3.1 provides an alternative  
tabular  method  that  may  be  used  to  determine  the 
voltage and current in an L–R circuit. 
 
Example 3.16 
 
A coil has an inductance of l00 mH and a resistance 
of 10 F. If the inductor is connected to a 5 V d.c.
