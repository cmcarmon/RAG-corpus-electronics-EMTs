Parts of this equation seem familiar to equations we’ve seen before. For instance, the de-
nominator of the large fraction looks conspicuously like the denominator of our parallel resis-
tance equation. And, of course, the E/R terms in the numerator of the large fraction should
give ﬁgures for current, Ohm’s Law being what it is (I=E/R).
