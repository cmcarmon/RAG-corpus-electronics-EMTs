In general, it is often convenient and possible to combine resis-
tors in series and parallel and reduce a resistive network to a single
Such an equivalent resistance is the resist-
equivalent resistance
ance  between  the  designated  terminals  of  the  network  and  must
exhibit  the  same  i-v characteristics  as  the  original  network  at  the
terminals.
