The electron carries a small negative charge of electricity. The proton carries a positive charge of
electricity equal and opposite to the charge of the electron. Scientists have measured the mass and size of
the electron and proton, and they know how much charge each possesses. Both the electron and proton
have the same quantity of charge, although the mass of the proton is approximately 1,827 times that of the
electron. In some atoms there exists a neutral particle called a neutron. The neutron has a mass
approximately equal to that of a proton, but it has no electrical charge.
