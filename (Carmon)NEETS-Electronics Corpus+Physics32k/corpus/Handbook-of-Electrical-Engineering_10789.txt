Power systems are expected to provide all customers a reliable supply of electric power upon which much
of modern life depends. Power systems are also very large, consisting of scores of large generators, hundreds
of miles of high-voltage transmission lines, thousands of miles of distribution lines, along with the necessary
transformers,  switchgear,  and  substations  interconnecting  them.  Reliability  at  the  customer  level  can  be
improved by additional investment; the challenge is to balance reliability and the associated investment cost
against the cost of energy charged to customers. This should be done in the presence of a number of random
inputs and events: generator outages, line outages (which are highly weather dependent), random component
outages, and uncertainties in the load demand (which is also weather dependent). Probabilistic techniques to
evaluate power system reliability have been used effectively to resolve this problem satisfactorily. The system is
divided into a number of subsystems and each one is analyzed separately. Then, composite system reliability
evaluation techniques are employed to combine the results and arrive at a number of quantiÔ¨Åable reliability
indices as inputs to managerial decisions. The major subsystems involved are generation, transmission, distri-
bution, substations, and protection systems. Care should be taken to ensure that reliabilities of different parts
of the system conform to each other and that no part of the system is unusually strong or weak. Obviously,
different  levels  of  reliability  will  be  required  for  different  parts  of  the  system  depending  on  the  impacts  of
failures at different points on the interconnected power system.
