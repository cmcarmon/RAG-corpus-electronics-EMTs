In  superlattices  energy  levels  of  individual  quantum  wells  are  split  into  minibands  as  a  result  of  electron
tunneling  through  the  wide-bandgap  layers.  This  occurs  if  the  electron  mean  free  path  is  larger  than  the
superlattice period. In such structures the electron motion perpendicular to the layer is quantized. In a one-
dimensional tight binding approximation the miniband can be described as
