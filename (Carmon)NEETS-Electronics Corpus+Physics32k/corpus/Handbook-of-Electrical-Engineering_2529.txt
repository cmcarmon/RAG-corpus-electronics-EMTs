The magnitude and phase relationships between vce and ic can easily be seen by including them on the signal
load-line diagram as shown in Fig. 24.30, where the output characteristics of the transistor have been omitted
for clarity. Sinusoidal output signals have been inserted, and either may be obtained from the other by following
the signal load-line locus.
