In general, let D be a first-order differential operator acting on a vector bundle V over a Riemannian manifold M. If





D

2


=
Δ
,



{\displaystyle D^{2}=\Delta ,\,}

where ∆ is the Laplacian of V, then D is called a Dirac operator.
In high-energy physics, this requirement is often relaxed: only the second-order part of D2 must equal the Laplacian.
