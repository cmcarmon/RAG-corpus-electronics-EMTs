Solution:
The  type  of  pulse  in  Fig.  7.31  is  called  the  gate  function.  It  may  be
regarded  as  a  step  function  that  switches  on  at  one  value  of  t and
switches off at another value of t. The gate function shown in Fig. 7.31
switches  on  at 
It  consists  of  the
sum  of  two  unit  step  functions  as  shown  in  Fig.  7.32(a).  From  the
Ô¨Ågure, it is evident that
