With respect to how the complementation constant C is chosen, we can further distinguish two representa-
tions  within  the  TC  system.  If  the  complementation  constant  is  chosen  to  be  equal  to  the  range  of  possible
£  rn – 1, then we have deﬁned the
values taken by x e, C =  rn in a conventional number system where 0 £  xe 
range complement (RC) system. If, on the other hand, the complementation constant is chosen to be C = rn – 1,
we have deﬁned the diminished radix complement (DRC) (also known as the digit complement [DC]) number
system. Representations of the RC and DRC number representation systems are shown in Table 86.10.
