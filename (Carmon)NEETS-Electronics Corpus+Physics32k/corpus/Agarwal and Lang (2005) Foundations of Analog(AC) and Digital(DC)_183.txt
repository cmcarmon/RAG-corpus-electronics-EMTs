Any physical length of wire will have some nonzero resistance. The resis-
tance dissipates energy and represents a loss of energy from the system. If this
resistance is important in a particular application, then we can model the wire
as an ideal conductor in series with a resistor, as suggested in Figure 1.27b. To
be consistent, we now state that the resistor symbol introduced in Figure 1.19
represents an ideal linear resistor, which by definition obeys Ohmâ€™s law
