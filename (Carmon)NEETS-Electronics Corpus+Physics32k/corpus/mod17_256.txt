With no input signal, R9 is adjusted until Q1 draws enough collector current to reduce its collector
voltage and the anode voltage of CR1 to a value below the voltage on the cathode of CR1. At this point
the anode voltage of the squelch diode is negative with respect to its cathode, and conduction ceases.
Audio output is now reduced to zero and the receiver is silent.
