Op amp circuits are used to amplify, offset, filter, sum, and buffer analog signals, 
among many other functions. The non-linear nature of transistors makes these operations 
difficult to perform without distortion. Op amps are able to avoid this problem by using 
the mechanisms of negative feedback.
