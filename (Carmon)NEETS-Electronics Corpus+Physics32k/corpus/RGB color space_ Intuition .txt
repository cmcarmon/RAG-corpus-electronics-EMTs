A RGB color can be understood by thinking of it as all possible colors that can be made from three colored lights for red, green, and blue. Imagine, for example, shining three lights together onto a white wall in a dark room: one red light, one green light, and one blue light, each with dimmers. If only the red light is on, the wall will be red. If only the green light is on, the wall will look green. If the red and green lights are on together, the wall will look yellow. Dim the red light and the wall will become more of a yellow-green. Dim the green light instead, and the wall will become more orange. Bringing up the blue light a bit will cause the orange to become less saturated and more whitish. In all, each setting of the three dimmers will produce a different result, either in color or in brightness or both. The set of all possible results is the gamut defined by those particular color lamps. Swap the red lamp for one of a different brand that is slightly more orange, and there will be a slightly different gamut, since the set of all colors that can be produced with the three lights will be changed.
A computer LCD display can be thought of as a grid of millions of little red, green, and blue lamps, each with their own dimmers. The gamut of the display will depend on the three colors used for the red, green, and blue lights. A wide-gamut display will have very saturated, "pure" light colors, and thus be able to display very saturated, deep colors.
