I.D. Systems' industrial vehicle management systems are used by manufacturers, distributors, retailers, government entities, and other organizations with powered industrial trucks (forklifts, tow tractors, pallet jacks, etc.) to monitor and evaluate fleet operations, track vehicle movement, and manage vehicle operators. The system consists of four elements: a wireless computer installed on the vehicle, wireless communication nodes placed within the facility, system software hosted either on site or in a remote data center, and user software configured in either a client-server or thin-client (Internet browser-based) architecture. Data may be transmitted by any combination of Wi-Fi, cellular or UHF wireless technologies.
The company offers three systems for industrial vehicle management. didBox™ is a non-wireless system for driver identification. PowerBox™ and PowerFleet® are wireless systems with functions ranging from operator access control, electronic safety checklists, and impact management to location tracking, battery management, maintenance scheduling, and task dispatching.
The company's customers in the industrial vehicle management market include Ford Motor Company, Nestlé North America, Procter & Gamble, Toyota, and Walmart (which accounted for 15% of the company's 2012 revenues).
