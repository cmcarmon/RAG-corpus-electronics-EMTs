• Input HIGH Current (IIH). The current ﬂowing into an input when the speciﬁed HIGH voltage is applied.
• Input LOW Current (IIL). The current ﬂowing into an input when the speciﬁed LOW voltage is applied.
• Output HIGH Current (IOH). The current ﬂowing into the output when it is in the HIGH state. IOHmax
