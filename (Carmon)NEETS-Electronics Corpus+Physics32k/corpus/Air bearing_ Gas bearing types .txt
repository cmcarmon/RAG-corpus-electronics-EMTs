Gas-lubricated bearings are classified in two groups, depending on the source of pressurization of the gas film providing the load-carrying capacity:
Aerostatic bearings: the gas is externally-pressurized (using a compressor or a pressure tank) and injected in the clearance of the bearing. Consequently, aerostatics bearings can sustain a load even in absence of relative motion but require an external gas compression system, which induces costs in terms of complexity and energy.
Aerodynamic bearings: the gas is pressurized by the relative velocity between the static and moving surfaces in the bearing. Such bearings are self-acting and do not require an external input of compressed gas. However, mechanical contact occurs at zero speed, requiring a particular tribological consideration to avoid premature wear.
Hybrid bearings combining the two families also exist. In such cases, a bearing is typically fed with externally-compressed gas a low speed and then relies partially or entirely on the self-pressurizing effect at higher speeds.
Among these two technological categories, gas bearings are classified depending on the kind of linkage they realize:
Linear-motion bearings: Support a translation along 1 or 2 directions between two planes
Journal bearings: Support a rotation between two parts
Thrust bearings: Block the axial displacement of a rotating part, usually used in combination with journal bearings
The main air bearing types fall under the following categories:
