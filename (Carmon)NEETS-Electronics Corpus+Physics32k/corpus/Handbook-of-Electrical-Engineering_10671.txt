due to loading effects between elements. The use of a circuit simulation program such as PSpice (MicroSim
Corp.) simpliﬁes the investigation into instrument behavior. A library of subcircuit models can be developed
for each instrumentation and interconnect element to support measurement system loading effects analysis.
For example, a PSpice subcircuit deﬁnition for the HP54601A oscilloscope is:
