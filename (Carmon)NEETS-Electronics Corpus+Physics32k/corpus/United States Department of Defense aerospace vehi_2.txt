All rockets and missiles contain a symbol to indicate the launch method, be it from the air, ground, sea, etc. The following are the currently authorized symbols for launch environments. These are not used for other aerospace vehicles.
A
Air-launched. The missile is launched from an airborne vehicle. Example is the AIM-9 Sidewinder dogfighting missile.
B
Multiple. The missile can be launched from various environments. The BGM-109 Tomahawk, for instance, can launch from a ground unit, aircraft, or ship-mounted launcher.
C
Coffin. Stored in an unhardened horizontal container (less than 45 degree angle) at ground level and either launched horizontally or raised vertical for launch. Coffin launchers may be either on land or at sea. For an example, see the early versions of the Atlas ICBM.
F
Individual. The missile is launched by an individual soldier in the field, otherwise referred to as man-portable. Example is the FIM-92 Stinger, a light man-portable surface-to-air missile (SAM).
G
Ground. The missile is launched directly from the ground surface, including runways.
H
Silo-Stored. The missile stored vertically in a silo but raised to ground level for launch. An example is the Atlas-F.
L
Silo-Launched. The missile is launched from its storage silo, buried in the ground.
M
Mobile. The missile is launched from a mobile ground vehicle.
P
Pad. Like a traditional space rocket, the missile is stored and launched from an unprotected ground facility.
R
Ship. The missile is launched from a ship or barge.
S
Space. The missile is launched from a spacecraft. This is so far used only for the upper stage of another rocket like the SSB-8 Centaur.
U
Underwater. The missile is launched from a submarine or underwater device.
