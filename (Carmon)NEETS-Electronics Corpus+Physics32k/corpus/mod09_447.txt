Figure 3-41, view (A), is a transistor sawtooth generator. In this figure R1 is a forward-biasing 
resistor for Q1, C1 is a coupling capacitor, and Q1 is serving as a switch for the RC network consisting of 
R2 and C2. With forward bias applied to Q1, the generator conducts at saturation, and its collector voltage 
(the output) is near 0 volts as indicated by the waveform in view (B). The charge felt by C1 is nearly 0. A 
negative gate is applied to the base of Q1 to cut off Q1 and allow C2 to charge. The length of time that the 
gate is negative determines how long Q1 will remain cut off and, in turn, how long C2 will be allowed to 
charge. The length of time that C2 is allowed to charge is referred to as the electrical length of the 
sawtooth that is produced.
