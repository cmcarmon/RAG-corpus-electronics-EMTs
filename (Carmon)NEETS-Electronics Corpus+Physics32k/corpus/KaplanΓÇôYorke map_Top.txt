The Kaplan–Yorke map is a discrete-time dynamical system. It is an example of a dynamical system that exhibits chaotic behavior. The Kaplan–Yorke map takes a point (xn, yn ) in the plane and maps it to a new point given by

where mod is the modulo operator with real arguments. The map depends on only the one constant α.
