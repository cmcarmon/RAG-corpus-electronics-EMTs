RADIO-FREQUENCY-CARRIER SHIFT.â€”For frequency-shift (fsk) systems, the transmitter 
provides a source of radio-frequency excitation. Figure 3-22 illustrates a basic frequency-shift keyed 
system. In modern systems, the keyer is built into the transmitter. The keyer shifts the signal box below or 
above the assigned frequency to correspond with the mark or space required to transmit tty characters. 
Normally the keyer is adjusted for an 850-hertz spread, 425 hertz above and 425 hertz below the assigned 
frequency. A spacing impulse will be 425 hertz above the operating frequency, and a marking impulse 
will appear 425 hertz below.
