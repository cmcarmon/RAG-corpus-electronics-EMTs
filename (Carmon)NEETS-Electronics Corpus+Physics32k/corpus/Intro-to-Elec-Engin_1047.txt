Much of the considerable progress made over the years in electric machinery is due to the
improvements in the quality and characteristics of steel and insulating materials, as well as to
innovative cooling methods. Modern large turbo alternators have direct water cooling (cooling
water circulated through hollow passages in their conductors, being in direct contact with the
copper conductors) in the stator (and the rotor in a few cases) and hydrogen cooling (with
hydrogen under 1 to 5 atmospheres of pressure) in the rotor. With hydrogen under pressure,
sealing the bearings appropriately needs particular attention for turbogenerators. For hydroelectric
generators, on the other hand, designing the thrust bearings for vertical mounting becomes a
prominent issue.
