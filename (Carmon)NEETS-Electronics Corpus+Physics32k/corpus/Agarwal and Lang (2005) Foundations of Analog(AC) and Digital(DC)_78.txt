As electrical engineers we are often interested in such computations in order
to design more complex circuits, perhaps involving multiple bulbs and batteries.
So how do we simplify our task? We observe that if we discipline ourselves to
asking only simple questions, such as what is the net current flowing through
the bulb, we can ignore the internal properties of the bulb and represent the
bulb as a discrete element. Further, for the purpose of computing the current,
we can create a discrete element known as a resistor and replace the bulb with
it.2 We define the resistance of the bulb R to be the ratio of the voltage applied
to the bulb and the resulting current through it. In other words,
