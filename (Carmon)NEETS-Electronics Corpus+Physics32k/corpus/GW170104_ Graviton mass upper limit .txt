The analysis of GW170104 yielded a new upper bound on the mass of gravitons, if gravitons are massive at all. The graviton's Compton wavelength is at least 1.6×1016 m, or about 1.6 light-years, corresponding to a graviton mass of no more than 7.7×10−23 eV/c2. This Compton wavelength is about 9×109 times greater than the gravitational wavelength of the GW170104 event.
