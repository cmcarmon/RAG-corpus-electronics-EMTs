Navy applications require that fiber optic cables meet stringent design specifications. Fiber optic
cables must be rugged to meet the optical, environmental, and mechanical performance requirements
imposed by Navy systems. Critical system downtime caused by cable failure cannot be tolerated.
However, in commercial applications, the requirements imposed on cable designs are not as stringent.
Each additional requirement imposed on the fiber optic cable design adds to its cost. Cost is always a
main consideration of cable designers in commercial applications. Cost is also considered in Navy
applications, but system reliability is the main goal.
