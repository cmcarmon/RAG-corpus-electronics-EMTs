where Par0 is the zero-order term, ParL accounts for the length dependence of the parameter, ParW accounts
for the width dependence, and Leff and Weff are the effective channel width and length, respectively. This approach
has a large inï¬‚uence on the device characterization strategy, as discussed later. Because of this tripling of the
number of parameters and for other reasons as well, the BSIM model has about 54 DC parameters and the
BSIM2 model has over 100.
