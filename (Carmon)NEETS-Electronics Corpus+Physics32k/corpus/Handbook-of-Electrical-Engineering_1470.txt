In  isolated  word  recognition  tasks,  an  HMM  is  created  for  each  word  in  the  recognition  vocabulary.  In
continuous speech recognition, on the other hand, a single HMM network is generated by expressing allowable
word strings or sentences as concatenations of word models, as shown in Fig. 15.19. In wordspotting, the HMM
network consists of a parallel connection of keyword models and a background model which represents the
speech  within  which  the  keywords  are  embedded.  Background  models,  in  turn,  typically  consist  of  parallel
connections of subword acoustic units such as phones [Wilcox and Bush, 1992].
