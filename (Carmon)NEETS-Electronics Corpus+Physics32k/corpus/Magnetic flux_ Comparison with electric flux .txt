By way of contrast, Gauss's law for electric fields, another of Maxwell's equations, is





Φ

E


=




{\displaystyle \Phi _{E}=\,\!}





S



{\displaystyle \scriptstyle S}





E

⋅
d

S

=


Q

ϵ

0








{\displaystyle \mathbf {E} \cdot d\mathbf {S} ={\frac {Q}{\epsilon _{0}}}\,\!}

where
E is the electric field,
S is any closed surface,
Q is the total electric charge inside the surface S,
ε0 is the electric constant (a universal constant, also called the "permittivity of free space").
Note that the flux of E through a closed surface is not always zero; this indicates the presence of "electric monopoles", that is, free positive or negative charges.
