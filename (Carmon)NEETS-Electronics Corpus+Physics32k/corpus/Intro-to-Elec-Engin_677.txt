Figure 7.4.5 illustrates the cross-sectional structure of an n-channel enhancement MOSFET
and its symbol showing as a normally off device when used for switching purposes. When the
gate-to-source voltage vGS > 0, an electric ﬁeld is established pushing holes in the substrate
away from the gate and drawing mobile electrons toward it, as shown in Figure 7.4.6(a). When
vGS exceeds the threshold voltage VT of the MOSFET, an n-type channel is formed along the gate
and a depletion region separates the channel from the rest of the substrate, as shown in Figure
7.4.6(b). With vGS > VT and vDS > 0, electrons are injected into the channel from the heavily doped
+
drain region, thereby forming drain-to-source current iD,
n
as shown in Figure 7.4.6(b). Note that none of the electrons comes from the p-type portion of the
substrate, which now forms a reverse-biased junction with the n-type channel. As the gate voltage
increases above VT, the electric ﬁeld increases the channel depth and enhances conduction. For
a ﬁxed vGS and small vDS, the channel has uniform depth d, acting like a resistance connected
between the drain and source terminals. The MOSFET is then said to be operating in the ohmic
state.
With a ﬁxed vGS > VT , increasing vDS will reduce the gate-to-drain voltage vGD(= vGS −
vDS ), thereby reducing the ﬁeld strength and channel depth at the drain end of the substrate. When
vDS > (vGS − VT ), i.e., vGD < VT , a pinched-down condition occurs when the electron ﬂow is
limited due to the narrowed neck of the channel, as shown in Figure 7.4.6(c). The MOSFET is
then said to be operating in a constant-current state, when iD is essentially constant, independent
of vDS.
Figure 7.4.7 illustrates the MOSFET behavior explained so far. When vGS ≤ VT , however,
the ﬁeld is insufﬁcient to form a channel so that the iD–vDS curve for the normally off state is
simply a horizontal line at iD = 0. The drain breakdown voltage BVDS ranges between 20 and
