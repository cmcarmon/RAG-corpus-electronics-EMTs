Piezoelectric 
materials  have  been  used  extensively  in  actuator  and  ultrasonic  receiver  applications,  while
ferroelectric 
materials have recently received much attention for their potential use in nonvolatile (NV) memory
applications. We will discuss the basic concepts in the use of these materials, highlight their applications, and
describe the constraints limiting their uses. This chapter emphasizes properties which need to be understood
for the effective use of these materials but are often very difÔ¨Åcult to research. Among the properties which are
discussed are
