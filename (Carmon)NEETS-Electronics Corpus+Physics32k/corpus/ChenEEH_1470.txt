Corresponding to each system call is a library procedure that
user programs can call. This procedure puts the parameters of
the system call
in a speciÔ¨Åed place, such as the machine
registers; it then issues a TRAP instruction, which is a kind
of protected procedure call, to start the operating system. The
purpose of the library procedure is to hide the details of the
TRAP instruction and make system calls look like ordinary
procedure calls.
