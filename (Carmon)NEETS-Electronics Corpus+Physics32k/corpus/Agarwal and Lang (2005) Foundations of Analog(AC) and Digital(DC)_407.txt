p r o b l e m 2.9 Calculate the power dissipated in the resistor R in Figure 2.90.
p r o b l e m 2.10 Design a resistor attenuator to make vo = vi/1000, using the
circuit configuration given in Figure 2.91, and resistor values available in your lab. This
problem is underconstrained so it has many answers.
