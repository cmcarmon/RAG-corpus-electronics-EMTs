Figure 3-33 is a block diagram of the equipment necessary for radio facsimile operation. View A 
shows the receiving system. This system consists of a standard radio receiver, a frequency-shift converter, 
and a facsimile recorder. View B shows two systems for transmitting TIF signals. The upper row of 
blocks is for carrier-frequency shift transmission. This system consists of a facsimile transceiver, a keyer 
adapter, a frequency shift keyer and a transmitter capable of fsk emission. The lower row of blocks is for 
audio-frequency shift transmission and uses a fax transceiver, a radio modulator, and an AM transmitter.
