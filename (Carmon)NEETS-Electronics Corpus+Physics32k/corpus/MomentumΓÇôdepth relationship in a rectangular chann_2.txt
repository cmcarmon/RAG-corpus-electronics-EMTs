The momentum equation can be applied to determine the force exerted by water on a sluice gate (Figure 7). Contrary to the conservation of fluid energy when a flow encounters a sluice gate, the momentum upstream and downstream of the gate is not conserved. The thrust force exerted by water on a gate placed in a rectangular channel can be obtained from the following equation, which can be derived in the same way as the conservation of momentum equation for rectangular channels:

{\displaystyle F_{\text{thrust-gate}}=\gamma b(\Delta M)=\gamma b(M_{\text{unit,1}}-M_{\text{unit,2}})}

Where:
Fthrust-gate = force exerted by water on the sluice gate (ML/t2)
γ = specific weight of water (M/L2t2)
ΔMunit = difference in momentum per unit width between the upstream and downstream sides of the sluice gate (L2).
