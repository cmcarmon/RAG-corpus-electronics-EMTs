The applications requiring D/A and A/D circuits in the 1990s have different performance criteria from those
of earlier years. In particular, low power and high speed applications are driving the development of D/A and
A/D  circuits,  as  the  devices  are  used  extensively  in  battery-operated  consumer  products.  The  predominant
applications  include  cellular  telephones,  hand-held  camcorders,  portable  computers,  and  set-top  cable  TV
boxes. These applications generally have low power and long battery life requirements, and they may have high
speed and high resolution requirements, as is the case with the set-top cable TV boxes.
