The BAI is calculated as:







100
×

hip circumference in m




height in m

×


height





−
18


{\displaystyle {\frac {100\times {\text{hip circumference in m}}}{{\text{height in m}}\times {\sqrt {\text{height}}}}}-18}

Hip circumference (R = 0.602) and height (R = −0.524) are strongly correlated with percentage of body fat. Comparing BAI with "gold standard" dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) results, the correlation between DXA-derived percentage of adiposity and the BAI in a target population was R = 0.85, with a concordance of C_b = 0.95.
