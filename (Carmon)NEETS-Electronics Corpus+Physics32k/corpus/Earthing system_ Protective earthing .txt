An earth ground connection of the exposed conductive parts of electrical equipment helps protect from electric shock by keeping the exposed conductive surface of connected devices close to earth potential, when a failure of electrical insulation occurs. When a fault occurs, current flows from the power system to earth. The current may be high enough to operate the over current protection fuse or circuit breaker, which will then interrupt the circuit. To ensure the voltage on exposed surfaces is not too high, the impedance (resistance) of the connection to earth must be kept low relative to the normal circuit impedance.
An alternative to protective earthing of exposed surfaces is a design with "double insulation" or other precautions, such that a single failure or highly probable combination of failures cannot result in contact between live circuits and the surface. For example, a hand-held power tool might have an extra system of electrical insulation between internal components and the case of the tool, so that even if the insulation for the motor or switch fails, the tool case is not energized.
