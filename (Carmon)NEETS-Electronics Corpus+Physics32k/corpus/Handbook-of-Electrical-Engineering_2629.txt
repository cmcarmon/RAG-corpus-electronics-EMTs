where CG is the MOSFET gate capacitance CG = Cox + Cpar, with Cox = eox ZL/d the MOSFET oxide capacitance,
and Cpar the parasitic component of the gate capacitance [Chen, 1990]. The parasitic capacitance  Cpar is due
mainly to overlap of the gate electrode over the source and drain and partly to fringing-ﬁeld and channel-edge
capacitances. For short-channel lengths, Cpar is a signiﬁcant part of CG, and keeping Cpar under control as L is
reduced is an objective of gate-drain alignment technology. Typically, VTH » VG/4, so
