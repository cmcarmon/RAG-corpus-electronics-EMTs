Electrorheological Smart Fluids
Current research on electrorheological ﬂuids is focused toward development of carrier–particle combinations
that result in the desirable characteristics to achieve smart elastic behavior [Gandhi and Thompson, 1989]. The
earlier versions of electrorheological ﬂuids contained adsorbed water, which limited their operating temperature
change (up to 80(cid:176)C). Particles in the newer electrorheological ﬂuids are, however, based on polymers, minerals,
and ceramics, which have a higher operating range (200(cid:176)C). Also, the increase in power consumption is less
with temperature increments in the recent anhydrous systems. The most commonly used carrier ﬂuids are silicone
oil, mineral oil, and chlorinated parafﬁn, which offer good insulation and compatibility for particulate dispersion.
