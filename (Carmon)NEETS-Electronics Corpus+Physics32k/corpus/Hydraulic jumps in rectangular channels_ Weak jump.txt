For the case when 1 < Fr1 < 1.7, y1 and y2 are approximately equal and only a very small jump occurs. In this range, the water surface shows slight undulations and because of this, jumps in this range are sometimes known as undular jumps. These surface riffles generally result in very little energy dissipation. As Fr1 approaches 1.7, a number of small rollers begin to form at the water surface at the jump location, but in general, the downstream water surface remains relatively smooth. Between 1.7 < Fr1 < 2.5, the velocity remains fairly uniform on either side of the jump and energy loss is low.
