How do we represent negative numbers? One simple alternative is to inter-
pret the leading bit as a sign bit: a 0 denotes a positive number and a 1 denotes
a negative number. Therefore, the number 110 represents âˆ’2, and the number
010 represents 2. When the interpretation of the leading bit (sign bit or value
bit) is not clear from the context, to avoid confusion, it is important to indicate
the numbering system being assumed when specifying a binary number.
