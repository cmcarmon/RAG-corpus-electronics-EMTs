MISR: Multiple-input LFSR.
Off-line testing: Testing process carried out while the tested circuit is not in use.
On-line testing: Concurrent testing to detect errors while circuit is in operation.
Pseudo-random  pattern  generator: Generates  a  binary  sequence  of  patterns  where  the  bits  appear  to  be
random in the local sense (1 and 0 are equally likely), but they are repeatable (hence only pseudo-random).
