Equipment performance data, along with other general information for various electronic
equipments, is available to help you in making comparisons. This information is provided in performance
standards books for each piece of equipment. It illustrates what a particular waveform should look like at
a given test point or what amplitude a voltage should be, and so forth. This data aids you in making
intelligent comparisons of current and baseline operating characteristics for the specific equipment
assigned to you for maintenance. ("Baseline" refers to the initial operating conditions of the equipment on
installation or after overhaul when it is operating according to design.)
