It  seems  clear  that  in  computer  relaying,  power  system  engineers  have  obtained  a  tool  with  exciting  new
possibilities.  Computers,  with  the  communication  networks  now  being  developed,  can  lead  to  improved
monitoring,  protection,  and  control  of  power  systems.  An  entirely  new  Ô¨Åeld,  adaptive  relaying,  has  been
introduced recently [Phadke and Horowitz, 1990]. The idea is that protection systems should adapt to changing
conditions of the power networks. In doing so, protection systems become more sensitive and reliable. Another
development, which can be traced to computer relaying, is that of synchronized phasor measurements in power
systems  [Phadke  and  Thorp,  1991].  The  development  of  the  Global  Positioning  System  (GPS)  satellites  has
made possible the synchronization of sampling clocks used by relays and other measuring devices across the
power system. This technology is expected to have a major impact on static and dynamic state estimation and
on control of the electric power networks.
