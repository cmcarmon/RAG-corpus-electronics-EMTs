Finally,  there  is  one  more  class  of  operation  to 
consider.  The  input  and  output  waveforms  for 
Class C operation are shown in Fig. 7.7. Here the 
bias point is set at beyond the cut-off (zero) point 
and a very large input signal is applied. The output 
waveform will then comprise a series of quite sharp 
positive-going  pulses.  These  pulses  of  current  or
