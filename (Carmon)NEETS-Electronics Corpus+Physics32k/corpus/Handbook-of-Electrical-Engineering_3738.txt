where q is the angle which the magnetization in the Permalloy makes relative to the direction of current ﬂow,
ro is the isotropic resistivity, and Dr is the magnetoresistivity. When the recording medium with a changing
magnetization  pattern  moves  under  the  MR  head,  the  stray  ﬁelds  from  the  medium  cause  a  change  in  the
