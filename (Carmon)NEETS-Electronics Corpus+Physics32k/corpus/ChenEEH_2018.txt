Theorem 1 implies that Mult_Float_Check can detect at least
three errors and correct a single error in the computation of
Cf ¼ Ac  Br as long as all operations, especially ﬂoating point
additions, have a large enough precision such that no roundoff
inaccuracies are introduced. Of course, such an ‘inﬁnite’ preci-
sion assumption is unrealistic, and the checksum scheme is
susceptible to roundoff introduced by ﬁnite precision ﬂoating
point arithmetic, as described previously. In particular, there
can be false alarms in which the checksum test fails due to
roundoff in spite of the absence of errors (that can occur due
to hardware glitches or failures) in the computation. Alterna-
tively, real errors could be masked or canceled by roundoff
leading to nondetection of a potential problem in the hardware.
