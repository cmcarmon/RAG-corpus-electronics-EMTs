which the input processor is called Schematics, the simulation processor is a version of SPICE
called PSpice, and the output processor is called PROBE. These three programs, working together,
create a graphical environment in which the circuit diagram and the analysis objectives are entered
using Schematics, the circuit is analyzed using PSpice, and the resulting circuit responses are
viewed using PROBE. A studentâ€™s version of these programs is widely available and is used in
this book.
