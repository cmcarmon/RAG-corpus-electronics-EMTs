Modal-Expansion Model
Modal expansions are useful for propagating electromagnetic ﬁelds because the source-ﬁeld relationship can
be expressed in terms of well-known analytical functions as an alternate way of writing a Green’s function for
special distributions of point sources. In two dimensions, for example, the propagator can be written in terms
of circular harmonics and cylindrical Hankel functions. Corresponding expressions in three dimensions might
involve  spherical  harmonics,  spherical  Hankel  functions,  and  Legendre  polynomials.  Expansion  in  terms  of
analytical solutions to the wave equation in other coordinate systems can also be used but requires computation
