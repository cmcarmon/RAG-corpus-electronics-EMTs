Pulse radar affords a great deal of design and operational ﬂexibility. Pulse duration and pulse rate can be
tailored to speciﬁc applications to provide optimal performance. Modern computer-controlled multiple-func-
tion radars exploit this capability by choosing the best waveform from a repertoire for a given operational mode
and interference environment automatically.
