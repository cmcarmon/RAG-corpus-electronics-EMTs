Consider situation solid wall parallel to the x-direction:

Assumptions made and relations considered-
The near wall flow is considered as laminar and the velocity varies linearly with distance from the wall
No slip condition: u = v = 0.
In this we are applying the “wall functions” instead of the mesh points.
Turbulent flow:





y

+


>
11.63



{\displaystyle y^{+}>11.63\,}
.
in the log-law region of a turbulent boundary layer.
Laminar flow :





y

+


<
11.63



{\displaystyle y^{+}<11.63\,}
.
Important points for applying wall functions:
The velocity is constant along parallel to the wall and varies only in the direction normal to the wall.
No pressure gradients in the flow direction.
High Reynolds number
No chemical reactions at the wall
