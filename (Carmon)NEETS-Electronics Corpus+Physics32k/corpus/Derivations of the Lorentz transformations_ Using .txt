According to the principle of relativity, there is no privileged Galilean frame of reference: therefore the inverse transformation for the position from frame R′ to frame R should have the same form as the original but with the velocity in the opposite direction, i.o.w. replacing v with -v:




x
=
γ

(


x
′

−
(
−
v
)

t
′


)

,


{\displaystyle x=\gamma \left(x'-(-v)t'\right),}

and thus




x
=
γ

(


x
′

+
v

t
′


)

.


{\displaystyle x=\gamma \left(x'+vt'\right).}
