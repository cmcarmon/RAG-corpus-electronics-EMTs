In polyatomic molecules, there are various parameters which determine the Hamiltonian of the system. The mutual distances between the atoms are one set of parameters. If both of the atoms of a diatomic molecule is same, the symmetry suggests that different configurations keeping their mutual distance fixed will result into same electronic states. So it is the relative distance



r


{\displaystyle r}
which acts as a parameter for the two equations promising level crossing. Hence due to the avoided crossing theorem in general we can not have level crossings between two electronic states of same symmetry. But in polyatomic molecules the number of independent mutual distances of nuclei are more. For a N-atomic molecule the number of independent mutual separation is




S
=
3
N
−
6



{\displaystyle \textstyle S=3N-6}
(for




N
≥
3



{\displaystyle \textstyle N\geq 3}
). Each of them acts as a parameter for the total Hamiltonian. Since we always have minimum of three independent parameters, level crossing is not totally avoided in these molecules.
