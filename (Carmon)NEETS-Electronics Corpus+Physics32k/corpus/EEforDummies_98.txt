Solar cells have wires attached to two 
terminals for conducting electrons 
through circuits, so you can power 
your calculator or the garden lights 
that frame your walkway. You may have 
seen arrays of solar cells used to power 
calculators (see Figure 1-8), emergency 
road signs, call boxes, or lights in park-
ing lots, but you probably haven’t seen 
the large solar‐cell arrays used to power 
satellites (not from close up, anyway).
