The basic unit of capacitance is the farad	(f). A 
farad is the amount of capacitance that can store 1 
coulomb (C) of charge when the capacitor is charged 
to 1 volt. The farad is too large a unit for ordinary use, 
so the microfarad	(mf) and picofarad	(pf) are 
used. The letter C stands for capacitance.
