The Sackur–Tetrode constant, written S0/R, is equal to S/kN evaluated at a temperature of T = 1 kelvin, at standard pressure (100 kPa or 101.325 kPa, to be specified), for one mole of an ideal gas composed of particles of mass equal to one atomic mass unit (mu = 1.660 539 040(20)×10−27 kg). Its 2014 CODATA recommended value is:
S0/R = −1.151 7084(14) for po = 100 kPa
S0/R = −1.164 8714(14) for po = 101.325 kPa.
