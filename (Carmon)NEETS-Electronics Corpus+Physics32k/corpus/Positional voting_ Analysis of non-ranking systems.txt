Although not categorised as positional voting electoral systems, some non-ranking methods can nevertheless be analysed mathematically as if they were by allocating points appropriately. Despite the absence of ranking here, favoured options are all treated as belonging to the higher of just two rank positions and all remaining options to the lower one. As the higher rank position is awarded a greater value than the lower one, then the two necessary criteria for positional voting are satisfied. Preferences that are given the same rank are not ordered within that rank.
Unranked single-winner methods that can be analysed as positional voting electoral systems include:
Plurality voting (FPTP): The most preferred option receives 1 point; all other options receive 0 points each.
Anti-plurality voting: The least preferred option receives 0 points; all other options receive 1 point each.
And unranked methods for multiple-winner elections (with W winners) include:
Single non-transferable vote: The most preferred option receives 1 point; all other options receive 0 points each.
Limited voting: The X most preferred options (where 1 < X < W) receive 1 point each; all other options receive 0 points each.
Bloc voting: The W most preferred options receive 1 point each; all other options receive 0 points each.
