As mentioned before, the analyses discussed earlier in this
section are based on a critical assumption—there are negligible
mutual
interactions between the antenna elements. This
allowed the key simpliﬁcation of equation 6.193. In situations
when this assumption is no longer valid, one needs to use the
rigorous equation 6.192. In this rigorous formulation, ei(u, f)
is different from that of an isolated antenna. Instead, ei(u, f)
is the transmit vector when only the ith element is excited
(other elements are open circuited with zero input currents),
while all other elements are still physically present in their
respective locations. In other words, ei(u, f) is the superpos-
ition of the primary radiation from the ith antenna (when
isolated), with secondary radiations from all the antenna elem-
ents passively excited through mutual coupling.
