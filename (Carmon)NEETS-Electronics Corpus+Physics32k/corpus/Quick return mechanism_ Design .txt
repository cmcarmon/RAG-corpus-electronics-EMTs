The disc influences the force of the arm, which makes up the frame of reference of the quick return mechanism. The frame continues to an attached rod, which is connected to the circular disc. Powered by a motor, the disc rotates and the arm follows in the same direction (linear and left-to-right, typically) but at a different speed. When the disc nears a full revolution, the arm reaches its furthest position and returns to its initial position at a quicker rate, hence its name. Throughout the cut, the arm has a constant velocity. Upon returning to its initial position after reaching its maximum horizontal displacement, the arm reaches its highest velocity.
The quick return mechanism was modeled after the crank and slider (arm), and this is present in its appearance and function; however, the crank is usually hand powered and the arm has the same rate throughout an entire revolution, whereas the arm of a quick return mechanism returns at a faster rate. The "quick return" allows for the arm to function with less energy during the cut than the initial cycle of the disc.
