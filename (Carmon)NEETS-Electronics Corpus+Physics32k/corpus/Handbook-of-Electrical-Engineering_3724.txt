The coercivity of the medium which is made from the particles is determined by the distribution of coer-
civities of the particles from which it is made, their orientation in the medium relative to the Ô¨Åelds from the
head, and their interactions among each other. The coercivities of a variety of particulate recording media are
summarized in Table 36.6.
