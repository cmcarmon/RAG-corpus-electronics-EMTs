Figure 36.8 also shows the construction used to ﬁnd the parameter S*. The quantity 1 – S* is found to be
very  close  to  DH/Hc, and  it  is  quicker  to  evaluate.  Either  of  these  parameters  can  be  used  to  determine  the
distribution of switching ﬁelds, small values of which are required to achieve high recording densities.
