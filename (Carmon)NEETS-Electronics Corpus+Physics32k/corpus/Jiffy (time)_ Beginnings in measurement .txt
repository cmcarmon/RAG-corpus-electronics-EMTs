The earliest technical usage for jiffy was defined by Gilbert Newton Lewis (1875â€“1946). He proposed a unit of time called the "jiffy" which was equal to the time it takes light to travel one centimeter in a vacuum (approximately 33.3564 picoseconds). It has since been redefined for different measurements depending on the field of study.
