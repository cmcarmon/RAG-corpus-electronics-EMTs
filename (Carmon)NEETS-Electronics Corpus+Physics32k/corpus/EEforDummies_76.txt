Working electrons deliver power
To electrons delivering energy to a light bulb or other device, the word work 
has real physical meaning. Work is a measure of the energy consumed by the 
device over some time when a force (voltage) is applied to a bunch of elec-
trons in the device. The more electrons you push, and the harder you push 
them, the more electrical energy is available and the more work can be done 
(for instance, the brighter the light, or the faster the motor rotation).
