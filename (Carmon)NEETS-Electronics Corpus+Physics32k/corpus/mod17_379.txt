The plugs on the patch cords are inserted into the jacks at the front of the panel. These plugs have 
three different parts. They are the tip, ring, and sleeve. The tip carries the intelligence signal while the 
ring carries the synchronizing (step) or timing signals. The sleeve carries an alarm signal that indicates 
(both visually and audibly) a problem to the operator. The problem may be equipment failure, loss of loop 
current, or improper patching. Commonly used combinations of equipment are often wired together 
within the panel (called normal-through). Individual pieces of equipment are wired on jacks to allow you 
to use them alone or in combination.
