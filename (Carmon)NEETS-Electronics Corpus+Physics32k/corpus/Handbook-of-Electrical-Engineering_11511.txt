Some of the complexities that are incorporated by using these types of technologies are associated with the
access to the information. For someone to be able to either “read” and/or “write” in the card, it must possess
technologies compatible with the ones where the information was created. It is a fundamental principle then
that  a  set  of  international  standards  will  be  created  so  that  any  hospital  that  requires  access  to  the  card
information can do so. Already the International Patient Cards Standards Council, the Health Industry Business
Communications  Council  (HIBCC),  and  the  Smart  Card  Applications  and  Technology  (SCAT)  have  been
created. These groups, among others, are working towards the goal of an international set of standards.
