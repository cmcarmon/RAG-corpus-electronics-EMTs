The built-in potential cbi is a function of the doping concen-
trations in both sides of the junction. For large devices, the
reduction in channel length due to pinch-off can be negligibly
small. Hence the channel conductance remains approximately
the same with a Ô¨Åxed voltage equal to VD, sat across the con-
ductive channel. The drain current no longer increases with
drain bias, and JFET is said to operate in the saturation region.
The drain current after pinch-off can be expressed as:
