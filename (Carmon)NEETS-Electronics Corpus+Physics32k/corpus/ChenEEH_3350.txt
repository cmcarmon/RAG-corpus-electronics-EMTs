Equal Area Criterion
To verify the transient stability, it is possible to derive analytical
conditions for the power system in Figure 7.15. For simplicity,
we assume that the damping constant D ¼ 0 and that the fault
clearing is instantaneous (tc ¼ 0). We recall that the dynamics
of the prefault system are described by:
