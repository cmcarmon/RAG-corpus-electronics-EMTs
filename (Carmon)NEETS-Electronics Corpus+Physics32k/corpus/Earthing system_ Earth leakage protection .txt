Earth Leakage of current can be very harmful for human beings, should it pass through them. To avoid accidental shock by electrical appliances/ equipment earth leakage relay/sensor are utilized at the source to isolate the power when leakage exceed certain limit. Earth leakage circuit breaker are used for the purpose. Current sensing breaker are called RCB/ RCCB. In the industrial applications, Earth leakage relays are used with separate CT(current transformer) called CBCT(core balanced current transformer) which sense leakage current(zero phase sequence current) of the system through the secondary of the CBCT and this operates the relay. This protection works in the range of milli-Amps and can be set from 30 mA to 3000 mA.
