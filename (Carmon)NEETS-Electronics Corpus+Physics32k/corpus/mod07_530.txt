Since you are familiar with the basic current regulating circuitry, let's examine in detail how the 
various components work to maintain the constant 400-milliampere output. Refer to the schematic shown 
in figure 4-43. Remember a decrease in load resistance causes a corresponding increase in current flow. In 
the example shown, the load resistance R L has dropped from 15 ohms to 10 ohms. This results in a larger 
voltage drop across R1 because of the increased current flow. The voltage drop has increased from 2.4 
volts to 2.5 volts. Of course, the voltage drop across CR1 remains constant at 9 volts due to its regulating 
ability. Because of the increased voltage drop across R1, the forward bias on Q1 is now 0.5 volt. Since the 
forward bias of Q1 has decreased, the resistance of the transistor increases from 9 ohms to 14 ohms. 
Notice that the 5 ohm increase in resistance across the transistor corresponds to the 5 ohm decrease in the 
load resistance. Thus, the total resistance around the outside loop of the circuit remains constant. Since 
the circuit is a current regulator, you know that output voltages will vary as the regulator maintains a 
constant current output. In the figure, the voltage output is reduced to 4 volts, which is computed by 
multiplying current (I) times resistance (R) (400 mA Ã— 10 ohms = 4 volts).
