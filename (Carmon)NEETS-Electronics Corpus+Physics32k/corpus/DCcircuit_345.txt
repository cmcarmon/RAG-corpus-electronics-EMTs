Downed power lines are an obvious source of electric shock hazard and should be avoided
at all costs. The voltages present between power lines or between a power line and earth
ground are typically very high (2400 volts being one of the lowest voltages used in residential
distribution systems). If a power line is broken and the metal conductor falls to the ground,
