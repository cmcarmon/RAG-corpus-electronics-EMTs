in the analysis of unbalanced three-phase network analysis. Transformations to decouple variables, to facilitate
the solution of difﬁcult equations with time-varying coefﬁcients, or to refer variables from one frame of reference
to another are employed in the analysis and simulation of three-phase ac machines.
