Composite Equalizers
In the previous subsection we examined the simplest forms of series equalization: gain adjustment, lead network
compensation,  and  lag  network  compensation.  In  this  subsection  we  will  consider  more  complex  design
examples in which composite equalizers will be used for series compensation. The same design principles used
earlier in this section will be used here as well.
