Most ionospheric absorption occurs in the lower regions of the ionosphere where ionization density 
is greatest. As a radio wave passes into the ionosphere, it loses some of its energy to the free electrons and 
ions. If these high-energy free electrons and ions do not collide with gas molecules of low energy, most of 
the energy lost by the radio wave is reconverted into electromagnetic energy, and the wave continues to 
be propagated with little change in intensity. However, if the high-energy free electrons and ions do 
collide with other particles, much of this energy is lost, resulting in absorption of the energy from the 
wave. Since absorption of energy depends on collision of the particles, the greater the density of the 
ionized layer, the greater the probability of collisions; therefore, the greater the absorption. The highly 
dense D and E layers provide the greatest absorption of radio waves.
