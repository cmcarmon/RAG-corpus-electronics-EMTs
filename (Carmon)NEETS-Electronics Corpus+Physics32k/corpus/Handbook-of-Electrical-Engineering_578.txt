Three-Point Method
The three-point method is a simpliÔ¨Åed analysis applicable to small levels of distortion and can only be used to
calculate HD2. The output is written directly as a Fourier cosine series as in Eq. (5.3) where only terms up to
the second harmonic are retained. The dc component includes the quiescent state and the contribution due to
distortion that results in a shift of the dc operating point. The output waveform values at w
1t =
p/2 (Fp/2), w
