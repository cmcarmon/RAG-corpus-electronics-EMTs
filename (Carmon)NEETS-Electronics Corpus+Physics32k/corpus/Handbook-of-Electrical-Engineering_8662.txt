Compiler Optimization and Assembly Language
Compiler Operations
To  understand  the  optimizing  features  of  compilers  and  their  relation  to  assembly  language,  it  is  best  to
understand some of the chores for the compiler. This section examines variable allocation and how it can be
optimized,  and  the  optimization  task  of  constant  expression  removal.  Examples  of  how  compilers  perform
these operations are taken from the various systems used in the article.
