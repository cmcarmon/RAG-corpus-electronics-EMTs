Section 13.4.1 begins by reviewing the frequency response of resistors,
capacitors, and inductors. This simple process will help us build some intuition,
which will then be used in Section 13.4.2 to develop a more general method of
sketching by inspection the frequency response for circuits containing a single
storage element and a resistor.
