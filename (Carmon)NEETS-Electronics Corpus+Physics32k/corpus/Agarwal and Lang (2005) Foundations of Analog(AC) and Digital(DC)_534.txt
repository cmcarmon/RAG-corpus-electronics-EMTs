In summary, the Norton method allows us to abstract the behavior of a
linear network at a given pair of terminals as a current source in parallel with
a resistor. The current source in parallel with the resistor is called the Norton
equivalent circuit of the network. Like the Th√©venin equivalent, the Norton
