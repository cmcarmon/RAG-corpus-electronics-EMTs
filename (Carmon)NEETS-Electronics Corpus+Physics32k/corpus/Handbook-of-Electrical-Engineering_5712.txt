Generally, since voltage ﬂuctuations have an amplitude not exceeding
–
10%, most equipment is not affected by this type of disturbance. Their
main disadvantage is ﬂicker, or ﬂuctuation of luminosity of an incandes-
cent  lamp.  The  important  point  is  that  it  is  impossible,  in  practice,  to
change  the  characteristics  of  the  ﬁlament.  The  physiological  discomfort
associated with this phenomenon depends on the amplitude of the ﬂuc-
tuations, the rate of repetition for voltage changes, and the duration of the
disturbance.  There  is,  however,  a  perceptibility  threshold  below  which
ﬂicker is not visible.
