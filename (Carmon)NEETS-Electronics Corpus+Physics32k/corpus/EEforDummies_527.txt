If, instead, the secondary consists of 50 turns of wire, and the primary con-
sists of 100 turns, the same AC signal applied to the same primary has a dif-
ferent result: The peak voltage across the secondary would be 25 V, or half 
the primary’s voltage. This is known as a step‐down transformer, for obvious 
reasons.
