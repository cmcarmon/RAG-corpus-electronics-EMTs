Battery
The battery for a pacemaker must be a safe and reliable energy source with a high energy density capable of
supplying several microamperes for longer than 5 years. In addition, it must be possible to reliably predict the
end of its life so that the pulse generator can be replaced before pacing fails. Because the battery accounts for
the majority of pacemaker volume, these requirements must be met while ensuring that the battery is as small
as possible. Nearly all modern pacemakers use lithium-iodine technology [Sanders and Lee, 1996]. This battery
has a high energy density and a low internal self-discharge, which combine to give a longer lifetime than past
batteries. Lithium serves as the anode, iodine combined with poly-2-vinyl pyridine serves as the cathode, and
a semisolid layer of lithium iodide serves as the electrolyte. The cell is hermetically sealed to prevent corrosion.
A new battery produces 2.8 V and declines linearly to 2.4 V near the end of its life. Either multiple batteries in
series or voltage multipliers can be used to achieve voltages greater than 2.8 V. The status of the battery can be
determined by several methods and can be telemetered out to the physician. The current drain of the device
ultimately determines the lifetime of the battery and is dependent on many factors, such as circuit operating
current, electrode impedance, and frequency, duration, and amplitude of the output pulses. SigniÔ¨Åcant improve-
ments in these areas have enabled the pacemaker battery to shrink in size.
