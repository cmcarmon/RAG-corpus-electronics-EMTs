Balance and Gait

As a result of stroke disease, Parkinsonism, arthritic changes, neuropathy, neuromuscular disease or vestibular disease.

Visual and Motor Reaction Time Problems

An extended reaction time will delay responses and compensations to standing or walking imbalances, thus increasing the likelihood of falls.

Medications
Polypharmacy is common in older people
Sedatives significantly increase the risk of falling
Cardiovascular medications can contribute towards falls

Visual impairment
Glaucoma, macular degeneration and retinopathy increase the risk of falling
Bifocals and trifocals can increase the risk of falling as the lower portion of corrective lenses are optimized for distances approximately 18inches, thus precluding clear vision of one's feet/floor, approximately 4.5 to 5.5 feet below one's eyes.

Cognitive problems
Dementia increases the likelihood of falls

Cardiovascular causes
Orthostatic hypotension
Postprandial hypotension
Carotid sinus syndrome
Neurocardiogenic syncopeâ€“ the commonest cause of syncope in A&E patients
Cardiac arrhythmias
Structural heart disease, such as valvular heart disease
