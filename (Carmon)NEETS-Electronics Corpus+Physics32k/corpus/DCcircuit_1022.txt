The strategy used in the Superposition Theorem is to eliminate all but one source of power
within a network at a time, using series/parallel analysis to determine voltage drops (and/or
currents) within the modiﬁed network for each power source separately. Then, once voltage
drops and/or currents have been determined for each power source working separately, the
values are all “superimposed” on top of each other (added algebraically) to ﬁnd the actual
