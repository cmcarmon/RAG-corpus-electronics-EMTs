Distributed Databases
A  distributed  database  [Ozsu  and  Valdurez,  1991]  is  a  collection  of  interrelated  databases  spread  over  the
nodes of a computer network. The management of the distributed database is the responsibility of a software
system usually known as distributed DBMS (DDBMS). One of the tasks of the DDBMS is to make the distributed
nature of the database transparent to the user. A distributed database usually reï¬‚ects the distributed nature of
some  applications.  For  example,  a  bank  may  have  branches  in  different  cities.  A  database  used  by  such  an
organization is usually distributed over all these sites. The different sites are connected by a computer network.
A user may access data stored locally or access data stored at other sites through the network.
