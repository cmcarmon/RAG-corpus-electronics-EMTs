HRC
HRC or current-limiting fuses have an interrupting rating of 200 kA and are recognized by a letter designation
system common to North American fuses. In the United States they are known as Class J, Class L, Class R, etc.,
and in Canada they are known as HRCI-J, HRC-L, HRCI-R, and so forth. HRC fuses are available in ratings
up to 600 V and 6000 A. The main differences among the various types are their dimensions and their short-
circuit performance (Ip and  I 2t) characteristics.
