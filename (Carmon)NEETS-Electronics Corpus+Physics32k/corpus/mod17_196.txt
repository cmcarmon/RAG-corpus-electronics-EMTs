The IF carrier is applied to the IF amplifier. The amplified IF carrier is then sent to the detector. The
output of the detector is the audio component of the input signal. This audio component is then passed
through an audio frequency amplifier. The amplified audio component is sent to a speaker for
reproduction. This allows you to hear the signal.
