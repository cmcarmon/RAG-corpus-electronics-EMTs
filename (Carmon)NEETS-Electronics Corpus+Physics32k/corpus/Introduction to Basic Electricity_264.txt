Since	it	is	the	method	for	the	extraction	of	information	on	a	circuit	that	can’t	be
retrieved	ordinarily,	reverse	engineering	is	argued	to	be	a	form	of	corrupt	hacking;
it	is,	therefore,	a	field	that	a	few	others	in	the	electronics	industry	attempt	to	avoid.
However,	for	many	number	of	circuit	engineers	(as	well	as	other	engineers),	there
is	brilliance	in	the	entire	concept	of	reverse	engineering.
According	to	those	who	are	not	against	the	field,	reverse	engineering	is	a	way	of
outsmarting	an	already	finished	product;	additionally,	as	they	would	insist,	isn’t	the
point	of	engineering	exactly	that	–	to	build	and	re-build	until	satisfying	outcome	is
achieved?	It	may	be	considered	as	a	form	of	hacking,	but	many	contest	to	the	idea
that	it	is	behind	corrupt	objectives.
