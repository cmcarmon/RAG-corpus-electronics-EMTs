Electrostriction is a second-order property that is tunable and nonlinear. Electrostrictive materials exhibit a
reproducible, nonhysteretic, and tunable strain response to electric ﬁelds, which gives them an advantage over
perovskite
piezoelectrics in micropositioning applications. While most electrostrictive actuator materials are 
ceramics,  there  has  been  much  interest  in  large  electrostriction  effects  in  such  polymer  materials  as  poly-
vinylidene ﬂuoride (PVDF) copolymers recently.
