The main power source VCC in conjunction
with the base-bias source IBB is used to establish
the operating point Q in Figure P7.3.8(b). Let the
2 Ib sin Ï‰t. Sketch
the sinusoidal variations of collector current iC,
collector voltage vC, and base current iB, super-
imposed on the direct values ICQ, VCQ, and IBQ,
respectively, and calculate the current gain corre-
sponding to a change in base current of 10 mA
(peak value).
