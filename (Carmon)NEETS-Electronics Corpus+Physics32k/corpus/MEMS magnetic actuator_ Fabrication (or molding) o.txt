There are several ways by which the magnet could be fabricated on a MEMS structure:

Sputtering: Argon ion bombardment of the material release particles of the material. Mainly for depositing rare earth magnets. Deposition rate and film surface area depend on sputtering tool and target size

Pulsed Layer Deposition: a high-power pulsed laser beam is focused inside a vacuum chamber to strike a target of the material that is to be deposited
Electroplating
Screen printing
Wax/parylene bonding
