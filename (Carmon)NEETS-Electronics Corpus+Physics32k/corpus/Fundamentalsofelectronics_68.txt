As important as linking analog signals to discrete-time ones may be, discrete-time signals are more
general, encompassing signals derived from analog ones and signals that aren’t. For example, the characters
forming a text ﬁle form a sequence, which is also a discrete-time signal. We must deal with such symbolic
valued (p. 153) signals and systems as well.
