You may be wondering why we are so interested in the frequency spectrum of an rf pulse. To better 
understand why, look at the spectrum of a transmitter as compared to the response curve of a receiver in 
figure 4-1. The receiver's response curve has a broader bandwidth than the transmitted spectrum, which 
ensures complete coverage. But the receiver responds best to frequencies in the middle of the bandwidth. 
This causes the receiver response to taper off from both sides of the center frequency until the response 
passes through the half-power points, as shown on the curve. Usually the receiver response beyond these 
points is too low to be useful and is not considered. Notice that the spectrum of the transmitter is centered 
inside the response curve of the receiver, thus yielding maximum efficiency.
