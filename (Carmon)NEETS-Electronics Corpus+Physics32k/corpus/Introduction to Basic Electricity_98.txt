Kirchhoff’s	Laws	are	composed	of	2	equations	that	dwell	on	the	conservation	of
charge	and	energy.	They	were	initially	introduced	in	1845	by	Gustav	Kirchhoff	as
a	means	for	the	determination	of	a	circuit’s	power	consumption,	as	well	as	its
parameters.	
As	several	discussions	go,	Kirchhoff’s	Laws	may	not	be	too	important	since	it	was
derived	from	the	work	of	Scottish	physicist,	James	Maxwell;	since	it	was	derived
from	another’s	work,	it	is	said	that	a	circuit	engineer	should	rather	use	the	original
work	as	basis.	However,	it	is	a	set	of	laws	that	primarily	focuses	on	the	operations
of	a	closed	circuit;	the	previous	work	from	which	it	was	taken	doesn’t	put
emphasis	on	a	closed	circuit,	and	is	rather	descriptive	of	the	generic	circuit.
Moreover,	Kirchoff’s	Laws	are	conditional.	It	may	be	useful	in	describing	charge
and	energy	conservation	for	different	circuit	elements,	but	it	can	only	yield	an
approximation;	it	also	requires	certain	factors	such	as	changing	electric	currents,
voltage,	and	resistance.
Kirchhoff’s	Law	is	actually	a	general	term.	To	be	specific,	it	addresses	2
subjects:	current	and	voltage.	It	acknowledges	all	circuits,	regardless	of
complexities.
To	solidify	its	argument	in	the	conservation	of	charge	and	energy,	one
of	Kirchhoff’s	Laws,	KCL	(or	Kirchhoff’s	Current	Law),	states	that	the
electric	current	in	an	interconnected	network	is	relative.	And,	to
emphasize	his	point,	Gustav	Kirchhoff	contests	that	the	algebraic	sum
of	the	electric	current	in	a	joint	network	is	0.
Another	law	of	Kirchhoff	that	complements	the	KCL	is	KVL	(or
Kirchhoff’s	Voltage	Law).	Its	basis	is	on	the	general	law	on	energy
