When the load is connected directly to the source of energy, or when the transmission line is short,
problems concerning current and voltage can be solved by applying Ohmâ€™s law. When the transmission
line becomes long enough so the time difference between a change occurring at the generator and the
change appearing at the load becomes appreciable, analysis of the transmission line becomes important.
