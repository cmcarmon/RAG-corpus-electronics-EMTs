Overlapping UPML absorbers at all trihedral corners:
We use the complete general tensor in equation 9.112.
Note that the generalized constitutive tensor deﬁned in
equation 9.112 is not uniaxial by strict deﬁnition but rather
is anisotropic. The anisotropic PML, however, is still refer-
enced as uniaxial since it is uniaxial in the nonoverlapping
PML regions.
