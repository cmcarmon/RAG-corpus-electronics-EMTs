At T2 the +25 volt input signal and the 23 volts across C1 are series opposing. The output voltage is 
+2 volts. The anode of D1 is positive with respect to the cathode and D1 will conduct. From T2 to T3, C1 
charges quickly from 23 to 25 volts through D1. At the same time, the output voltage falls from +2 to 0 
volts.
