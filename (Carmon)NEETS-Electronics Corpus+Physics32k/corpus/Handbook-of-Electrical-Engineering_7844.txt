The advantages of magnetic ﬁeld modulation recording are that (1) direct overwriting is possible and (2) domain-
wall  positions  along  the  track,  being  rather  insensitive  to  defocus  and  laser  power  ﬂuctuations,  are  fairly
accurately controlled by the timing of the magnetic ﬁeld switchings. On the negative side, the magnet must
now be small and ﬂy close to the disk surface, if it is to produce rapidly switched ﬁelds with a magnitude of a
hundred  gauss  or  so.  Systems  that  utilize  magnetic  ﬁeld  modulation  often  ﬂy  a  small  electromagnet  on  the
opposite side of the disk from the optical stylus. Since mechanical tolerances are tight, this might compromise
the removability of the disk. Moreover, the requirement of close proximity between the magnet and the storage
medium dictates the use of single-sided disks in practice.
