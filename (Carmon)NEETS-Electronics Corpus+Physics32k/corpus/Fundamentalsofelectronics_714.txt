Problem 5.28: Removing “Hum”
The slang word “hum” represents power line waveforms that creep into signals because of poor circuit con-
struction. Usually, the 60 Hz signal (and its harmonics) are added to the desired signal. What we seek are
ﬁlters that can remove hum. In this problem, the signal and the accompanying hum have been sampled; we
want to design a digital ﬁlter for hum removal.
