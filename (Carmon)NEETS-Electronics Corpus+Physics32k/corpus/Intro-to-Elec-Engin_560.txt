Figure 6.2.15(a) shows the block diagram of a dual-ramp (dual-slope) A/D converter. After a
start-of-conversion pulse, the counter is cleared and the analog input Vin becomes the input of the
ramp generator (integrator). When the output of the ramp generator Vo reaches zero, the counter
starts to count. After a Ô¨Åxed amount of time T, as shown in Figure 6.2.15(b), the output of the
ramp generator is proportional to the analog input signal. At the end of T, the reference voltage
Vref is selected, when the integrator gives out a ramp with a positive slope. As Vo increases, the
counter is incremented until Vo reaches the comparator threshold voltage of 0 V, when the counter
