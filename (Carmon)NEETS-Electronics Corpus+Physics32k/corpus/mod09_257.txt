Just as in any transistor circuit, changes in the transistor operating point and changes in temperature 
are encountered in the transistor oscillator. The effects of changes in temperature are to cause collector 
current to increase if the transistor is not stabilized. The increase in collector current can be prevented by 
reducing the forward bias.
