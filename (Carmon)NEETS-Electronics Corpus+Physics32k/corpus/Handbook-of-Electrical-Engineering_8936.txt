These  delays  set  limits  to  the  positional  accuracy,  as  the
computer tracking the signal will be in error by this amount.
Other inaccuracies are due to the dimensions of the optical
pickup surface, all of which somewhat negate the simplicity
of  operation.  The  result  is  the  parameter  values  shown  in
Table 89.3.
