For the analysis of network problems, transformations for converting a delta-connected
network to an equivalent wye-connected network and vice versa will be found to be useful.
The relationships for interconversion of wye and delta networks are given in Figure 4.2.1. These
are similar to those given in Section 2.4 for resistive network reduction. They can be obtained
by imposing the condition of equivalence that the impedance between any two terminals for
one network be equal to the corresponding impedance between the same terminals for the other
network. The details are left as a desirable exercise for the student. For the balanced case, each
wye impedance is one-third of each delta impedance; conversely, each delta impedance is three
times each wye impedance.
