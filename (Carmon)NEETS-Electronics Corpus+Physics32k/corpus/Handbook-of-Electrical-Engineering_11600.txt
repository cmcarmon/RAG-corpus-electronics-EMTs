Of  the  two  branches  of  calculus,  integral  calculus  is  richer  in  its  applications,  as  well  as  in  its  theoretical
content.  Though  the  theory  is  not  emphasized  here,  important  applications  such  as  ﬁnding  areas,  lengths,
volumes,  centroids,  and  the  work  done  by  a  nonconstant  force  are  included.  Both  cylindrical  and  spherical
polar coordinates are discussed, and a table of integrals is included. Vector analysis is summarized in a separate
section and includes a summary of the algebraic formulas involving dot and cross multiplication, frequently
needed  in  the  study  of  ﬁelds,  as  well  as  the  important  theorems  of  Stokes  and  Gauss.  The  part  on  special
functions includes the gamma function, hyperbolic functions, Fourier series, orthogonal functions, and both

-transforms. The Laplace transform provides a basis for the solution of differential equations and

Bessel functions, also called cylindrical functions, arise in many physical applications, such as the heat transfer
in  a  “long”  cylinder,  whereas  the  other  orthogonal  functions  discussed—Legendre,  Hermite,  and  Laguerre
polynomials—are  needed  in  quantum  mechanics  and  many  other  subjects  (e.g.,  solid-state  electronics)  that
use concepts of modern physics.
