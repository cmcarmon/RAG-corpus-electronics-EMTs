▶✓ Never expose a breadboard to heat because you can permanently 
damage the plastic. ICs and other components that become very hot 
(because of a short circuit or excess current, for example) may melt the 
plastic underneath them. Touch all the components while you have the 
circuit under power to check for overheating.
