A related issue is to decide upon the number of symbols
(centroids) in the VQ codebook if a discrete-observation
model is used. One measure of the quality of a codebook is
the average distance of a vector observation in the training data
from its corresponding symbol. This ﬁgure is often called the
codebook distortion. The smaller the distortion, the more
accurately the centroids represent the vectors they replace. Typ-
ically, recognizers use codebooks of size 32–256 with the larger
sizes being more common. Since a larger codebook implies
increased computation, there is an incentive to keep the code-
book as small as possible without decreasing performance. Like
the other parametric decisions that must be made about an
HMM, this issue is principally guided by experimental evidence.
