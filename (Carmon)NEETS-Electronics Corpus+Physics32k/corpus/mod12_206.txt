View (A) of figure 1-46 shows the plate supply voltage for V1 as a constant dc value (Eb) at time 1 
with no modulating signal applied. V1 is biased at cutoff at this time. The incoming rf carrier [view (A)] 
is applied to the grid of V1 by transformer T1 and causes the plate circuit current to PULSE (SURGE)
