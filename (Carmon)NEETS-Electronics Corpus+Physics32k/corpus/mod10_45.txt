You may wonder why you can see light but not radio waves, which consist of the same form of
energy as light. The reason is that you can only "see" what your eyes can detect. Your eyes can detect
radiant energy only within a fixed range of frequencies. Since the frequencies of radio waves are below
the frequencies your eyes can detect, you cannot see radio waves.
