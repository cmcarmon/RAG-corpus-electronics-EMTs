The poles of a system are deﬁned as all values of s such that sI – A is singular. The poles of a closed-loop
transfer function are exactly the same as the eigenvalues of the system: engineers prefer the term poles and the
symbol s, and mathematicians prefer the term eigenvalues and the symbol l. We will use s for complex frequency
and l  for speciﬁc values of s.
