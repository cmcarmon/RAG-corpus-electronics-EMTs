1. It turns out that the mapping of voltage ranges to logical values has a significant impact on the
robustness of digital circuits, and a methodical way of selecting the mapping will be presented in
Section 5.1. But for now, let us proceed with this rather arbitrarily chosen mapping, and continue
to build our intuition.
