Printers are widely used output devices that express coded characters on hard (paper document) copy 
(fig. 2-23). They print out computer program results as numbers, letters, words, symbols, graphics, or 
drawings. Printers range from electronic typewriters to high-speed printers. High-speed printers are 
usually used on mainframes and minis to prepare supply requisitions, pay checks, inventory, or financial 
reports at 10 lines per second and faster. The types of printers we'll discuss are daisy-wheel, dot matrix, 
ink jet, and laser. These are the ones commonly used with personal computers.
