The main danger of household current is the effect it can have on your heart 
muscle. It takes only 65–100 mA to send your heart into fibrillation, which 
means the muscles contract in an uncontrolled, uncoordinated fashion — 
and the heart isn’t pumping blood. At much lower levels (10–16 mA), AC 
current can cause severe muscle contractions, so what might start out as a 
loose grip on a high‐voltage wire (just to move it a little bit, or something like 
that) ends up as a powerful, unyielding grip. Trust me: You won’t be able to 
let go. A stronger grip means a lower resistance (you’re just making it easier 
for electrons to travel through your hand and into your body), and a lower 
resistance means a higher (often fatal) current. (Situations like this really do 
happen. The body acts like a variable resistor, with its resistance decreasing 
sharply as the hands tighten around the wire.)
