machine language typically has between 50 and 300 instruc-
tions, mostly for moving data around the machine, doing
arithmetic, and comparing values. Physical devices are con-
trolled by loading values into special device registers. For
example, a disk can be commanded to read by loading the
values of the disk address, main memory address, byte count,
and direction (read/write) into its registers. A major function
of the operating system is to hide all this complexity and give
the programmer a more convenient set of instructions to work
with.
