Since the understanding of seismic anisotropy is closely tied to the shear wave splitting, we begin this section by discussing shear wave splitting.
Shear waves have been observed to split into two or more fixed polarizations which can propagate in the particular ray direction when entering an anisotropic medium. These split phases propagate with different polarizations and velocities. Crampin (1984) amongst others gives evidence that many rocks are anisotropic for shear wave propagation. In addition, shear wave splitting is almost routinely observed in three-component VSPs. Such shear wave splitting can be directly analyzed only on three component geophones recording either in the subsurface, or within the effective shear window at the free surface if there are no near surface low-velocity layers. Observation of these shear waves show that measuring the orientation and polarization of the first arrival and the delay between these split shear waves reveal the orientation of cracks and the crack density . This is particularly important in reservoir characterization.
In a linearly elastic material, which can be described by Hooke's law as one in which each component of stress is dependent on every component of strain, the following relationship exists:

where σ is the stress, C is the elastic moduli or stiffness constant, and e is the strain.
The elastic modulus matrix for an anisotropic case is

For an anisotropic medium, the directional dependence of the three phase velocities can be written by applying the elastic moduli in the wave equation is; The direction dependent wave speeds for elastic waves through the material can be found by using the Christoffel equation and are given by

The approximate expressions for the wave velocities are simple enough to be physically interpreted, and sufficiently accurate for most geophysical applications. These expressions are also useful in some contexts where the anisotropy is not weak.
The Thomsen parameters are anisotropic and are three non-dimensional combinations which reduce to zero in isotropic cases, and are defined as
