Alternatively,  one  can  imagine  resolving  phasor I  into  two  components,  one  in  phase  with V  and  one  in
quadrature with it, as illustrated in Fig. 3.22(c). Then P is the product of the magnitude of V with the in-phase
component of I, and Q is the product of the magnitude of V with the quadrature component of I. Real power
is produced only by the in-phase components of V and I. The quadrature components contribute only to the
reactive power.
