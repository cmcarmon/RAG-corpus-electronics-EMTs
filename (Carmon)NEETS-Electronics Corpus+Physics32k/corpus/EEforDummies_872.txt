If you have a permanent place in your house to work on electronics, you can 
hang some of the hand tools mentioned in this section on the wall or a peg-
board. Reserve this special treatment for the tools you use the most. You can 
stash other small tools and some supplies in a small toolbox, which you can 
keep on your workbench. A plastic fishing tackle box with lots of small com-
partments and one large section can help you keep your things organized.
