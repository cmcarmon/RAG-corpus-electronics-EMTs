The IAU(1976) system is based on the astronomical system of units:
The astronomical unit of time is the day (D) of 86,400 SI seconds, which is close to the mean solar day of civil clock time.
The astronomical unit of mass is the mass of the Sun (S).
The astronomical unit of length is known as the astronomical unit (A or au), which in the IAU(1976) system is defined as the length for which the gravitational constant, more specifically the Gaussian gravitational constant k expressed in the astronomical units (i.e. k2 has units A3S−1D−2), takes the value of 0.017 202 098 95 . This astronomical unit is approximately the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun. The value of k is the angular velocity in radians per day (i.e. the daily mean motion) of an infinitesimally small mass that moves around the Sun in a circular orbit at a distance of 1 AU.
