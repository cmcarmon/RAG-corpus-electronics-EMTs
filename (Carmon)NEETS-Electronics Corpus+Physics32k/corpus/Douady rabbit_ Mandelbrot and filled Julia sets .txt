There are two planes associated with





M




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {M}}}
. One of these, the



z


{\displaystyle z}
(or



w


{\displaystyle w}
) plane, will be called the mapping plane, since





M




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {M}}}
sends this plane into itself. The other, the



γ


{\displaystyle \gamma }
(or



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }
) plane, will be called the control plane.
The nature of what happens in the mapping plane under repeated application of





M




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {M}}}
depends on where



γ


{\displaystyle \gamma }
(or



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }
) is in the control plane. The filled Julia set consists of all points in the mapping plane whose images remain bounded under indefinitely repeated applications of





M




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {M}}}
. The Mandelbrot set consists of those points in the control plane such that the associated filled Julia set in the mapping plane is connected.
Figure 1 shows the Mandelbrot set when



γ


{\displaystyle \gamma }
is the control parameter, and Figure 2 shows the Mandelbrot set when



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }
is the control parameter. Since



z


{\displaystyle z}
and



w


{\displaystyle w}
are affine transformations of one another (a linear transformation plus a translation), the filled Julia sets look much the same in either the



z


{\displaystyle z}
or



w


{\displaystyle w}
planes.
