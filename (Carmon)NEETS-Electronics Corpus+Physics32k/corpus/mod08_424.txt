Since changing the inductance of a coil enables the control of power to a load, what methods are
available to change the inductance? Before answering that question, you should recall a few things about
magnetism and inductors from NEETS, Module 1—Introduction to Matter, Energy, and Direct Current,
chapter 1—Matter, Energy, and Electricity; and Module 2 —Introduction to Alternating Current and
Transformers, chapter 2—Inductance.
