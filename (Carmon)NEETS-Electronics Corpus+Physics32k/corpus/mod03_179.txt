Coil a is connected in series with R3 and the unknown resistance, Rx, to be measured. The
combination of coil, R3, and Rx forms a direct series path between the positive (+) and negative ( - )
brushes of the dc generator. Coil b is connected in series with R2 and this combination is also connected
across the generator. There are no restraining springs on the movable member of the instrument portion of
the megger. Therefore, when the generator is not operated, the pointer floats freely and may come to rest
at any position on the scale.
