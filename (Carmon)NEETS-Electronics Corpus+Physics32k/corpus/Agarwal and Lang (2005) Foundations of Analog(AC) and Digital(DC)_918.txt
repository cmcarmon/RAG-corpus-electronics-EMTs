d) We now connect identical NAND circuits together and have the resulting Circuit Y
satisfy the static discipline for the voltage thresholds in part (c) with RL = 500 .
Give specifications on the dimensions of the MOSFETs such that total MOSFET
area is minimized. As before, assume that the area of a device is L× W. Assume that
Rn = 1 k and no resistor dimension or MOSFET gate dimension should be smaller
than 0.5 µm. For what inputs does Circuit Y dissipate maximum static power, and
what is that power?
