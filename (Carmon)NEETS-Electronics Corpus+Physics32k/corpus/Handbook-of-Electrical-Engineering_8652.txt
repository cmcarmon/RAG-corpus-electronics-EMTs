To  begin  with,  all  three  do  roughly  the  same  thing.  The  only  noticeable  difference  in  concept  is  that  the
SPARC compiler chose to compare the incoming character (*source) to 47 (the character before ‘0’) and then
branch if the result showed the letter to be “less than or equal,” while the other two compared it to ‘0’ as asked
and then branched if the result was “less than.” No big deal. But let us walk down the several columns to see
the speciﬁc details. Prior to beginning, note that all three must bring in the character, run one or two tests,
and then set an integer to either zero (false) or not zero (true). Also, let it be said that each snatch of code is
