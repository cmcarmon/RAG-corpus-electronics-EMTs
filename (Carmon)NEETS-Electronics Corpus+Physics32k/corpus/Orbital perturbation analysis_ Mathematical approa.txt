of the position

{\displaystyle x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}\,}

and the velocity

{\displaystyle v_{1},v_{2},v_{3}\,}

From the chain rule of differentiation one gets that the time derivative of

where

{\displaystyle f_{1}\ ,\ f_{2}\ ,\ f_{3}}
are the components of the force per unit mass acting on the body.
If now

{\displaystyle g}
is a "constant of motion" for a Kepler orbit like for example an orbital element and the force is corresponding "Kepler force"

{\displaystyle (f_{1}\ ,\ f_{2}\ ,\ f_{3})\ =\ -{\frac {\mu }{r^{3}}}\ (x_{1}\ ,\ x_{2}\ ,\ x_{3})}

one has that

{\displaystyle {\dot {g}}\ =\ 0\,}
.
If the force is the sum of the "Kepler force" and an additional force (force per unit mass)

one therefore has

and that the change of
