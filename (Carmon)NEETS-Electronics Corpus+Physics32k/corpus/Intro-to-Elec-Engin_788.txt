Both DTL and TTL are based on the saturating BJT inverter. The transistor acts as a switch
that connects or disconnects the collector and emitter. The switch is closed when sufÔ¨Åcient base
current is applied to saturate the transistor. While the BJT technologies have dominated during
the 1970s, logic families based on MOSFET technology are now more widely used because of the
advantages of fewer fabrication steps and generally lower power consumption. After PMOS and
NMOS technologies, CMOS emerged as the dominant MOS technology and remains so today.
