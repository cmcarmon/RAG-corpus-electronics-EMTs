Cutoff wavelength may be measured on uncabled or cabled single mode fibers. A slightly different
procedure is used in each case, but the basic measurement process is the same. The test method for
uncabled single mode fiber cutoff wavelength is EIA/TIA-455-80. The test method for cabled single
mode fiber cutoff wavelength is EIA/TIA-455-170. The fiber cutoff wavelength (l ) measured under
EIA/TIA-455-80 will generally be higher than the cable cutoff wavelength ( l ) measured under EIA/TIA-
455-170. The difference is due to the fiber bends introduced during the cable manufacturing process.
