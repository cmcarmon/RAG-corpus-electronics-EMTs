Absolute angular momentum sums the angular momentum of a particle or fluid parcel in a relative coordinate system and the angular momentum of that relative coordinate system.
Meteorologists typically express the three vector components of velocity v = (u, v, w) (eastward, northward, and upward). The magnitude of the absolute angular momentum L per unit mass m

{\displaystyle \left|{\frac {\mathbf {L} }{m}}\right|=M=ur\cos(\phi )+\Omega r^{2}\cos ^{2}(\phi )}

where
M represents absolute angular momentum per unit mass of the fluid parcel (in m2/s),
r represents distance from the center of the earth to the fluid parcel (in m),
u represents earth-relative eastward component of velocity of the fluid parcel (in m/s),
φ represents latitude (in rad), and
Ω represents angular rate of Earth's rotation (in rad/s , usually 2 π rad/1 sidereal day ≈ 72.921150 × 10−6 rad/s ).
The first term represents the angular momentum of the parcel with respect to the surface of the earth, which depends strongly on weather. The second term represents the angular momentum of the earth itself at a particular latitude (essentially constant at least on non-geological timescales).
