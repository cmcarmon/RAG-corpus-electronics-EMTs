for rerecording. May be accomplished in two ways.  (1) In ac erasure, the tape is
demagnetized by an alternating magnetic field that is reduced in amplitude from an initially
high value. May be accomplished by passing the tape over an erase head fed with high-
frequency ac, or by placing the whole roll of tape in a decreasing ac field (bulk erasure).
(2) In dc erasure, the tape is saturated by applying a primarily unidirectional field. May be
accomplished by passing the tape over a head fed with dc or over a permanent magnet.
Additional stages may be included in dc erasure to leave the tape in a more nearly
unmagnetized condition.
