response. When an SIP message goes through a number of
proxies, each such proxy appends to this ﬁeld with its own
address and port. This enables the receiver to send back an
acknowledgment through the same set of proxies. The From
(or To) ﬁeld speciﬁes the SIP URI of the sender (or receiver) of
the invitation, which is usually the e-mail address assigned to
the user. The call-ID contains a globally unique identiﬁer of
this call generated by a combination of a random string and
IP address. The Content-Length and Content-Type ﬁelds
describe the body of the SIP message.
