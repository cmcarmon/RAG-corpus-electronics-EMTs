In crystals atoms interact and bind by sharing valence electrons. The wave function is
no longer associated with a single atom but extends over the entire crystal. One eï¬€ect of
the interaction between the atoms is that the otherwise degenerate energy levels split into
closely spaced levels. Since the number of atoms is large, it is common to refer to this set of
levels as a continuous energy band.
