A high-pass filter also consists of a resistor and 
 capacitor in series (Figure 24-4). However, the output 
is taken across the resistor. At high frequencies, the 
capacitive reactance is low, and most of the voltage is 
dropped across the resistor. As the frequency decreases, 
the capacitive reactance increases, and more voltage is 
dropped across the capacitor. This results in a decrease 
in the output voltage across the resistor. Again, the 
drop in output voltage is gradual.  FigureÂ 24-5 shows a 
 frequency response curve for an RC high-pass filter.
