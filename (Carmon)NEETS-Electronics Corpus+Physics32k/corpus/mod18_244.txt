A transmitted rf pulse with a steep trailing edge is essential for the detection of objects at short
ranges. If the magnetron output voltage drops gradually from its maximum value to zero, it contributes
very little to the usable energy of the transmitted rf pulse. Furthermore, part of the magnetron output
voltage enters the receiver and obscures nearby object echoes.
