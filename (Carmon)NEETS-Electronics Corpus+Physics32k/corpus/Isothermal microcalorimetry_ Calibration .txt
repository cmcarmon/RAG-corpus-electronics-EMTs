For operation in either hc or pc mode, routine calibration in commercial instruments is usually accomplished with built-in electric heaters. The performance of the electrical heaters can in turn be validated using specimens of known heat capacity or which produce chemical reactions whose heat production per unit mass is known from thermodynamics (Wadsö and Goldberg 2001). In either hc or pc mode, the resulting signal is a computer-recordable voltage, calibrated to represent specimen μ W-range heat flow vs. time. Specifically, if no significant thermal gradients exist in the specimen, then P = eC [U + t (dU/dt)], where P is heat flow (i.e. μ W), εC is the calibration constant, U the measured potential difference across the thermopile, and t the time constant. Under steady-state conditions—for example during the release of a constant electrical calibration current, this simplifies to P = eC U. (Wadsö and Goldberg 2001).
