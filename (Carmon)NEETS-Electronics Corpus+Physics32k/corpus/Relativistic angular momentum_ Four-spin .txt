A particle may have a "built-in" angular momentum independent of its motion, called spin and denoted s. It is a 3d pseudovector like orbital angular momentum L.
The spin has a corresponding spin magnetic moment, so if the particle is subject to interactions (like electromagnetic fields or spin-orbit coupling), the direction of the particle's spin vector will change, but its magnitude will be constant.
The extension to special relativity is straightforward. For some lab frame F, let F′ be the rest frame of the particle and suppose the particle moves with constant 3-velocity u. Then F′ is boosted with the same velocity and the Lorentz transformations apply as usual; it is more convenient to use β = u/c. As a four-vector in special relativity, the four-spin S generally takes the usual form of a four-vector with a timelike component st and spatial components s, in the lab frame

although in the rest frame of the particle, it is defined so the timelike component is zero and the spatial components are those of particle's actual spin vector, in the notation here s′, so in the particle's frame

so if the magnitude of spin is given in the rest frame of the particle and lab frame of an observer, the magnitude of the timelike component st is given in the lab frame also.

The covariant constraint on the spin is orthogonality to the velocity vector,

are the components of spin the lab frame, calculated from those in the particle's rest frame. Although the spin of the particle is constant for a given particle, it appears to be different in the lab frame.
