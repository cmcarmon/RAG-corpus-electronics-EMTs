which is the same as for QPSK/OQPSK.
The minimal shift keying modulation makes the phase
change linear and limited to  p=2 over a bit interval T. This
enables MSK to provide a signiÔ¨Åcant improvement over QPSK.
Because of the effect of the linear phase change, the power
spectral density has low side lobes that help to control adjacent
channel interference. However, the main lobe becomes wider
