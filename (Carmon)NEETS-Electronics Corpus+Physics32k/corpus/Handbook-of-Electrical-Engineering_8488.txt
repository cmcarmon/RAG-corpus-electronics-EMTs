Booth Encoding
Booth’s  algorithm  [Booth,  1951]  is  widely  used  in  the  implementations  of  hardware  or  software  multipliers
because its application makes it possible to reduce the number of partial products. It can be used for both sign-
magnitude numbers as well as 2’s complement numbers with no need for a correction term or a correction step.
