With a seismic array the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a seismic signal can be improved by summing the coherent signals from the single array sites. The most important point during the beamforming process is to find the best delay times, with which the single traces must be shifted before summation in order to get the largest amplitudes due to coherent interference of the signals.

For distances from the source much larger than about 10 wavelengths, a seismic wave approaches an array as a wavefront that is close to planar. The directions of approach and propagation of the wavefront projected onto the horizontal plane are defined by the angles Φ and Θ.
Φ Backazimuth (BAZ) = angle of wavefront approach, measured clockwise from the North to the direction towards the epicenter in degree.
Θ Direction in which the wavefront propagates, measured in degree from the North, with Θ = Φ ±180°.
dj Horizontal distances between array site j and center site in [km].
s Slowness vector with absolute value s = 1/ vapp
vapp Apparent velocity vector with the absolute value vapp = 1/s . vapp = (vapp,x ,vapp,y ,vapp,z), where vapp,x ,vapp,y ,vapp,z are the single apparent velocity components in [km/s] of the wavefront crossing an array.
vapp,h Absolute value of the horizontal component of the apparent velocity.

In most cases, the elevation differences between single array sites are so small that travel-time differences due to elevation differences are negligible. In this case, we cannot measure the vertical component of the wavefront propagation. The time delay τj between the center site 0 and site j with the relative coordinates (xj, yj) is

In some cases, not all array sites are located on one horizontal plane. The time delays τj also depends on the local crustal velocities (vc) below the given site j. The calculation of τj with coordinates (xj, yj, zj) is

Let wj(t) be the digital sample of the seismometer from site j at time t, then the beam of the whole array is defined as

If seismic waves are harmonic waves S(t) without noise, with identical site responses, and without attenuation, then the above operation would reproduce the signal S(t) accurately. Real data w(t) are the sum of background noise n(t) plus the signal of interest S(t), i.e. w(t) = S(t) + n(t). Assuming that the signal is coherent and not attenuated, calculating the sum of M observations and including noise we get
