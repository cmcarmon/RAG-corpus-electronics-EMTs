In early 1992, the World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC-92) was held, during which frequency
allocations for many different radio systems were debated. As a result of WARC-92, a worldwide L-band standard
of  1452  to  1492  MHz  was  designated  for  both  satellite  and  terrestrial  digital  radio  broadcasting.  However,
because of existing government and military uses of L-band, the United States was excluded from the standard.
Instead, an S-band allocation of 2310 to 2360 MHz was substituted. Additionally, Asian nations including Japan,
China, and CIS opted for an extra S-band allocation in the 2535- to 2655-MHz frequency range.
