Example 10.5 
 
Identify each of the following integrated circuits: 
 
(i) 4001UBE; 
(ii) 74LS14. 
 
Solution 
 
Integrated  circuit  (i)  is  an  improved  (unbuffered) 
version  of  the  CMOS  4001  device.  Integrated 
circuit  (ii)  is  a  low-power  Schottky  version  of  the 
TTL 7414 device.
