The effects of the electronics revolution are com-
plex.  For  the  profession,  the  most  obvious  impact
has been explosive growth. The increase in the num-
ber of students studying in the ﬁeld continues to be
dramatic and shows no signs of slowing. The elec-
trical engineering community represents the largest
single technical group in the world, and the mem-
bers of the IEEE make up the world’s largest engi-
neering society. (Courtesy of the IEEE Center for the
