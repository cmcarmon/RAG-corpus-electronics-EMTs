The dc current gain B is (obviously) a derived quantity
rather than a basic physical parameter of a transistor. There-
fore, for modeling purposes, it is easier to describe separately
the collector and base current rather than B, as is still often
attempted in compact models. For circuit design purposes,
only an average value of B is usually required and can be
readily provided.
