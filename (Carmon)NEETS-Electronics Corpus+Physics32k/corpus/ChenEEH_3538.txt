A special class of LSI systems commonly used in modeling
and implementation is the class that is described by a linear
constant-coefﬁcient difference or differential equation in the
case of discrete and continuous time, respectively. It should be
pointed out that depending on the speciﬁed auxiliary (or
‘‘initial’’) conditions, a system described by a linear constant-
coefﬁcient difference or differential equation may not be LSI
