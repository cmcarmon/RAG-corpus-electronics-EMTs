If an analysis of the voicing of the speech signal indicates a voiced or periodic component is present, another
step in the analysis process may be to estimate the frequency (or period) of the voiced component. There are
a  number  of  ways  in  which  this  may  be  done.  One  is  to  measure  the  time  lapse  between  peaks  in  the  time
domain signal. For example in Fig. 15.7 the major peaks are separated by about 0.0071 s, for a fundamental
frequency of about 141 Hz. Note, it would be quite possible to err in the estimate of fundamental frequency
by mistaking the smaller peaks that occur between the major peaks for the major peaks. These smaller peaks
are produced by resonance in the vocal tract which, in this example, happen to be at about twice the excitation
frequency. This type of error would result in an estimate of pitch approximately twice the correct frequency.
The distance between major peaks of the autocorrelation function is a closely related feature that is frequently
used  to  estimate  the  pitch  period.  In  Fig. 15.8,  the  distance  between  the  major  peaks  in  the  autocorrelation
function is about 0.0071 s. Estimates of pitch from the autocorrelation function are also susceptible to mistaking
the Ô¨Årst vocal track resonance for the glottal excitation frequency.
