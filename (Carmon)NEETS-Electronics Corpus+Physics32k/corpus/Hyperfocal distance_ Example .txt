As an example, for a 50 mm lens at



f

/

8


{\displaystyle f/8}
using a circle of confusion of 0.03 mm, which is a value typically used in 35 mm photography, the hyperfocal distance according to Definition 1 is




H
=



(
50

)

(

)
(

)



+
(
50
)
=
10467


mm




{\displaystyle H={\frac {(50)^{2}}{(8)(0.03)}}+(50)=10467{\mbox{ mm}}}

If the lens is focused at a distance of 10.5 m, then everything from half that distance (5.2 m) to infinity will be acceptably sharp in our photograph. With the formula for the Definition 2, the result is 10417 mm, a difference of 0.5%.
