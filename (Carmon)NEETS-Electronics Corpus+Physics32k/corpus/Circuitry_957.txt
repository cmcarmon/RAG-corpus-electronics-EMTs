It’s  worth  noting  from  the  previous  example  that 
we  have  used  the  laws  of  indices  to  simplify  the 
powers  of 
the 
calculator 
the  final  result.  The 
alternative  to  doing  this  is  to  make  use  of  the 
exponent  facility  on  your  calculator.  Whichever 
technique  you  use  it’s  important  to  be  confident 
that  you  are  correctly  using  the  exponent  notation 
since  it’s  not  unknown  for  students  to  produce 
answers  that  are  incorrect  by  a  factor  of  1,000  or 
even  1,000,000  and  an  undetected  error  of  this 
magnitude could be totally disastrous!  
  Before  attempting  to  substitute  values  into  an 
equation, it’s important to be clear about what you 
know (and what you don’t know) and always make 
sure  that  you  have  the  correct  units.  The  values 
marked  on  components  can 
sometimes  be 
misleading and it’s always worth checking that you
