The failure rate function is clearly dependent upon time; however, experience has shown that the failure rate
function for electronic components does have a period where the value of z(t) is approximately constant. The
commonly accepted relationship between the failure rate function and time for electronic components is called
the bathtub curve and is illustrated in Fig. 93.6. The bathtub curve assumes that during the early life of systems,
failures occur frequently due to substandard or weak components. The decreasing part of the bathtub curve is
called the early-life or infant mortality region. At the opposite end of the curve is the wear-out region where
systems  have  been  functional  for  a  long  period  of  time  and  are  beginning  to  experience  failures  due  to  the
physical  wearing  of  electronic  or  mechanical  components.  During  the  intermediate  region,  the  failure  rate
function is assumed to be a constant. The constant portion of the bathtub curve is called the useful-life phase
