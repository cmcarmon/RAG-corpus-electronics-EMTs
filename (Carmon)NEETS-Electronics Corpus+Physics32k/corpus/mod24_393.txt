Arc fusion involves the discharge of electric current across a gap between two electrodes. By placing
the fiber ends between the electrodes, the electric discharge melts or fuses the ends of each fiber. Figure
4-13 shows the placement of the fiber ends between tungsten electrodes during arc fusion. Initially, a
small gap is present between the fiber ends. A short discharge of electric current is used to prepare the
fiber ends for fusion. During this short discharge, known as prefusion, the fiber ends are cleaned and
rounded to eliminate any surface defects that remain from fiber cleaving. Surface defects can cause core
distortions or bubble formations during fiber fusion. A fusion splice results when the fiber ends are
pressed together, actively aligned, and fused using a longer and stronger electric discharge. Automated
fusion splicers typically use built-in local optical power launch/detection schemes for aligning the fibers.
