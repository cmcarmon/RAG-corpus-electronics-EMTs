14.1.15 Certain waveforms can be viewed as a combi-
nation of some other waveforms for which the
Fourier coefﬁcients are already known. Exam-
ple 14.1.4 shows some periodic waveforms for
which the coefﬁcients a0, an, and bn are given by
Equations (14.1.12) through (14.1.14), respec-
tively. Use those to ﬁnd the nonzero Fourier-
series coefﬁcients for the waveforms given in
Figure P14.1.15.
