There is also a displacement current corresponding to the time-varying electric displacement field D:

{\displaystyle \mathbf {J} _{\mathrm {D} }={\frac {\partial \mathbf {D} }{\partial t}}}

which is an important term in Ampere's circuital law, one of Maxwell's equations, since absence of this term would not predict electromagnetic waves to propagate, or the time evolution of electric fields in general.
