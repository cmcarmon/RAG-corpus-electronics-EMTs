The Pandemonium effect appears when the daughter nucleus has a large Q value, allowing the access to many nuclear configurations, which translates in many excitation-energy levels available. This means that the total beta feeding will be fragmented, because it will spread over all the available levels (with a certain distribution given by the strength, the level densities, the selection rules, etc.). Then, the gamma intensity emitted from the less populated levels will be weak, and it will be weaker as we go to higher energies where the level density can be huge. Also, the energy of the gammas de-excitating this high density level region can be high.
Measuring these gamma rays with high resolution detectors may present two problems:
First, these detectors have a very low efficiency of the order of 1-5%, and will be blind to a weak gamma radiation in most of the cases.
Second, their efficiency curve drops to very low values as it goes to higher energies, starting from energies of the order of 1-2 MeV. This means that most of the information coming from gamma rays of huge energies will be lost.
These two effects reduce how much of the beta feeding to the higher energy levels of the daughter nucleus is detected, so less ΣIi is subtracted from the IT, and the energy levels are incorrectly assigned more Iβ than present:
ΣIi ~ 0, → IT ≈ Iβ
When this happens, the low-lying energy levels are the more affected ones. Some of the level schemes of nuclei that appear in the nuclear databases suffer from this Pandemonium effect and are not reliable until better measurements are made in the future.
