Commonly, it is not enough for the inverter to meet the preceding switch-
ing criteria. In real systems, however, it must also provide for adequate noise
margins by satisfying a static discipline. The inverter characteristic shown in
Figure 6.40 provides us with adequate information to determine whether the
inverter satisfies a given static discipline. As an example,
let us determine
whether the inverter satisfies a static discipline with the following voltage
thresholds:
