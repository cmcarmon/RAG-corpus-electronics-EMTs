The ratio in 4.73 refers to the number of local data paths p to
the number of registers r in a circuit. Similarly, the memory
complexity of all three algorithms is O(r 2) where the numer-
ical constant of the r 2 term is a function of k introduced in
equation 4.73. This relationship is exploited to determine the
most efﬁcient algorithm for a speciﬁc circuit.
