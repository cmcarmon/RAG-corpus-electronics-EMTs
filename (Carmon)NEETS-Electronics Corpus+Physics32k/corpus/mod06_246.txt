The actual characteristics of a tube are measured by two factors: mu(µ) or AMPLIFICATION
FACTOR; and TRANSCONDUCTANCE or gm. The amplification factor (represented as µ) of a tube is
equal to the ratio of a change in plate voltage to the change in grid voltage required to cause the same
change in plate current. This is expressed mathematically as
