Square hvat is used as the basis for other units of surface in the hvat system.
motika; one motika = 200 square hvats = 719.3304 square meters.
jutro ("morning", compare the unit Morgen) or Joch in Austria ; one jutro = 8 motika = 1,600 square hvats = 5,754.6432 square meters.
lanac; one lanac = 10 motika = 2,000 square hvats = 7,193.304 square meters.
When used today, the units are often rounded to the nearest square meter. Thus, jutro is rounded to 5,755 square meters and lanac is rounded to 7,192 square meters. When more precision is needed, katastarsko jutro (meaning cadastral jutro) is used, that equals exactly 0.5754642 hectares (5,754.642 square meters).
Other historical units that are sometimes used to measure surface together with the square hvat are:
dulum; one dulum equals 1,000 square meters.
šinik; one šinik equals 1,000 square meters.
