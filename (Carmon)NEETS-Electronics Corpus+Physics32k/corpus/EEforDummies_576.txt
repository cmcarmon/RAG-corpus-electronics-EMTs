Figure 9­9 shows a single‐color LED. The shorter lead is usually attached to 
the cathode (negative side). You can also identify the cathode by looking 
through the plastic housing: The larger metal plate inside is the cathode 
and the smaller plate is the anode. (Nice to know — especially after you’ve 
clipped the leads.)
