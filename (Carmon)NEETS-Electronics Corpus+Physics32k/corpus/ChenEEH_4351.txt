The reader is most likely familiar with any number of
algebras or classes of algebras such as exterior, multilinear,
Lie, Jordan, composition, alternative, differential, nonassocia-
tive, Boolean, commutative, or division. Some of these listed
algebras may be misnomers according to the strict deÔ¨Ånition of
an algebra. Of course, the point is that algebra is much more
than operations. It is an axiomatic framework governed by a
global view of the whole construct. It is a way of describing
how a basic element behaves. And that, after all, is control in its
most rudimentary sense.
