Suppose that the axis of a right circular cylinder passes through the center of a sphere of radius R and that h represents the height (defined as the distance in a direction parallel to the axis) of the part of the cylinder that is inside the sphere. The "band" is the part of the sphere that is outside the cylinder. The volume of the band depends on h but not on R:




V
=



π

h

.


{\displaystyle V={\frac {\pi h^{3}}{6}}.}

As the radius R of the sphere shrinks, the diameter of the cylinder must also shrink in order that h can remain the same. The band gets thicker, and this would increase its volume. But it also gets shorter in circumference, and this would decrease its volume. The two effects exactly cancel each other out. In the extreme case of the smallest possible sphere, the cylinder vanishes (its radius becomes zero) and the height h equals the diameter of the sphere. In this case the volume of the band is the volume of the whole sphere, which matches the formula given above.
An early study of this problem was written by 17th-century Japanese mathematician Seki Kōwa. According to Smith & Mikami (1914), Seki called this solid an arc-ring, or in Japanese kokan or kokwan.
