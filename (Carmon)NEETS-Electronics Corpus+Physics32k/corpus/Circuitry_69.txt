 
1.15  A  voltage  drop  of  13.2  V  appears  across  a 
resistor when a current of 4 mA flows in it.
 
 
What is the value of the resistor? 
1.16  A power supply is rated at 15 V, 1 A. What
value  of  load  resistor  would  be  required  to
 
 
test the power supply at its full rated output? 
1.17  A  wirewound  resistor  is  made  from  a  4  m 
length  of  aluminium  wire  (, = 2.18  Ã— 10(cid:1)8
 
<m). Determine the resistance of the wire if 
it has a cross-sectional area of 0.2 mm2.
