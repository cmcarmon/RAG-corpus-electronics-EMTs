Lock bumping is a trend in burglaries, which can make it easy and fast to break into homes without needing too much special equipment or leaving any trace of forced entry. It works almost as well as actually having a key, and a set of 10 rapping keys can make the criminals capable of opening 90% of common tumbler locks. However, criminals might choose to avoid lock bumping when stealth is required, because of the noisiness of the process. Almost all tumbler locks are vulnerable to bumping.
