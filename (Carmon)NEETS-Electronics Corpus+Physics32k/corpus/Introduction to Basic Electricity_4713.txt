Compare instructions compare data in the ac-
cumulator with data from a memory location or an-
other register. The result of the comparison is not 
stored in the accumulator, but a flag bit might change 
as a result of it. Masking or bit testing may be used 
to perform comparison. masking is a process of sub-
tracting two numbers and allowing only certain bits 
through. The mask is a predetermined set of bits that 
is used to determine whether certain conditions ex-
ist within the MPU. There is a disadvantage with the 
masking procedure because it uses an AND instruc-
tion and therefore destroys the content of the accumu-
lator. The bit-testing procedure, although it also uses 
an AND instruction, does not destroy the content of 
the accumulator. Not all microprocessors have a bit-
testing instruction.
