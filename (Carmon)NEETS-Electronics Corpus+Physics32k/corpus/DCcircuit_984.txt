Well, that takes care of two equations, but I still need a third equation to complete my
simultaneous equation set of three variables, three equations. This third equation must also
include the battery’s voltage, which up to this point does not appear in either two of the pre-
vious KVL equations. To generate this equation, I will trace a loop again with my imaginary
voltmeter starting from the battery’s bottom (negative) terminal, stepping clockwise (again,
the direction in which I step is arbitrary, and does not need to be the same as the direction of
the mesh current in that loop):
