Solvent-Solute interactions are similar to solute-solute and solvent-solvent interactions
Since the enthalpy of mixing (solution) is zero, the change in Gibbs free energy on mixing is determined solely by the entropy of mixing. Hence the molar Gibbs free energy of mixing is

where m denotes molar, i.e., change in Gibbs free energy per mole of solution, and

Note that this free energy of mixing is always negative (since each
