Example
An example of the convolution for two continuous-time signals
is considered now. It illustrates the property that the duration of
convolved signal is equal to the sum of the durations of the two
signals that are convolved. For discrete-time convolution, the
duration of the sum obtained as a convolution sum is equal to
the sum of the durations of the signals less one.
