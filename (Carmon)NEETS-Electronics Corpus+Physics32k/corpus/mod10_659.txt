Voltage and current distribution for the half-wave antenna (shown in figure 4-16) is the same as that 
for the antenna discussed earlier in this chapter. A point closely related to the voltage and current 
distribution on an antenna is the method of feeding the transmitter output to the antenna. The simplest 
method of feeding energy to the half-wave antenna is to connect one end through a capacitor to the final 
output stage of the transmitter. This method is often called the END-FEED or VOLTAGE-FEED method. 
In this method the antenna is fed at a point of high voltage (the end).
