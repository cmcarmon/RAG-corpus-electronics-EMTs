When metal intercell interconnections cannot be safely routed over cells, interconnection channels must be
provided between rows of logic cells, leading to the wiring channels above and/or below rows of logic cells as
shown  in  Fig. 25.29.  In  this  approach,  all  connections  to  and  from  a  logic  cell  are  fed  from  the  top  and/or
bottom wiring channel. The width of the wiring channel is adjusted to provide space for the number of intercell
interconnections required in the channel. Special cells providing through-cell routing can be used to support
short interconnections between adjacent rows of cells. Given this layout style at the lowest level of cells, larger
functions can be readily constructed, as illustrated in Fig. 25.30(a). Figure 25.29(b) illustrates interconnections
(provided in the polysilicon layer under the metal layers) to the logic cells from the wiring channel. For classical
CMOS logic cells, the same set of input signals are applied to both the pull-up and pull-down sections, as in
the example in Fig. 25.27(b). By organizing the sequence of transistors along the pull-up and pull-down sections
properly, inputs can extend vertically between a PMOS transistor in the pull-up section and a corresponding
NMOS  transistor  in  the  pull-down  section. Algorithms  to  determine  the  appropriate  ordering  of  transistors
evolved early in CAD tools.
