Speech Synthesis
Speech synthesis is the creation of speech-like waveforms from textual words or symbols. In general, the speech
synthesis process may be divided into three levels of processing [Klatt, 1982]. The Ô¨Årst level transforms the text
into a series of acoustic phonetic symbols, the second transforms those symbols to smoothed synthesis param-
eters, and the third level generates the speech waveform from the parameters. While speech synthesizers have
