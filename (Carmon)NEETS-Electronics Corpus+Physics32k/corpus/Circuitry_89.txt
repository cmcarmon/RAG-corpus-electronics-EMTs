is given by the equation: 
 
Rt = R0(1 + " t + $ t2 + % t3 ...) 
 
where  ", $, %, etc.  are  constants  and  R0 is  the 
resistance at 0°C. 
  The  coefficients,  $, %, etc.  are  quite  small  and 
since we are normally only dealing with a relatively 
restricted temperature range (e.g. 0°C to 100°C) we 
can usually approximate the characteristic shown in 
Fig. 2.14 to the straight line law shown in Fig. 2.15. 
In this case, the equation simplifies to: 
 
Rt = R0(1 + " t)
where " is  known as the temperature  coefficient 
of resistance. Table 2.4 shows some typical values 
for  " (note  that  " is  expressed  in  $/$/°C  or  just  
/°C). 
 
Example 2.15 
 
A resistor  has  a 
temperature  coefficient  of  
0.001/°C. If the resistor has a resistance of 1.5 k$
at 0°C, determine its resistance at 80°C. 
 
Solution 
 
Now 
 
Rt = R0(1 + " t)
thus 
 
Rt = 1.5k$ × (1 + (0.001 × 80)) 
 
Hence 
 
Rt = 1.5 × 1.08 = 1.62 k$
