Overmodulation will generate unwanted (SPURIOUS) sideband frequencies. This effect can easily 
be detected by tuning a receiver near, but somewhat outside the desired frequency. You would likely be 
able to tune to one or more of these undesired sideband frequencies, but the reception would be severely 
distorted, possibly unintelligible. (Without overmodulation, no such unwanted sideband frequencies 
would exist and you would be able to tune only to the desired frequency.) These unwanted frequencies 
will appear for a considerable range both above and below the desired channel. This effect is sometimes 
called SPLATTER. These spurious frequencies, shown in view (B), cause interference with other stations 
operating on adjacent channels. You should clearly understand that overmodulation, and its attendant 
distortion and interference is to be avoided.
