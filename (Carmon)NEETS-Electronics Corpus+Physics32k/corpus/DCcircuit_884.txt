Another application for thermocouples is in the measurement of average temperature be-
tween several locations. The easiest way to do this is to connect several thermocouples in
parallel with each other. The millivolt signal produced by each thermocouple will average out
at the parallel junction point. The voltage differences between the junctions drop along the
resistances of the thermocouple wires:
