There are several versions of SCSI standards: SCSI-1 stan-
dard supports transfer rates of up to 3 MBPs, SCSI-2 supports
up to 20 MBPs, and SCSI-3 supports up to 40 MBPs. In a chain
of SCSI devices, any one can be either an initiator or a target.
Normally, the SCSI controller, acting as an initiator, issues
commands to other SCSI devices acting as targets. The com-
mands descriptor block (CDB) can be up to 16 bytes and tells
the target what to do. These CDB commands are also used to
arbitrate the bus when more than two SCSI devices try to use
the bus as the same time. This arbitration mechanism im-
proves performance by allowing more than two SCSI devices
to be activated at the same time, whereas only one IDE device
can be activated at one time. The following are lists of charac-
teristics for different SCSIs:
