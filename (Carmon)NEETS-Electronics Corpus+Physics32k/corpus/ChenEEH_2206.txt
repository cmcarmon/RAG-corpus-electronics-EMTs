Equation 2.2c deﬁnes the D ﬁeld as the ﬂux produced in space
by its source, the charge density r, a quantity that is always
conserved. Because of equation 2.2a, the E ﬁeld is shown as the
gradient of a potential function; therefore, it is a measure of
the force exerted on charges by a given electrostatic ﬁeld.
Equation 2.2b then shows that the strength of this force
depends on the environment in which the charges in question
are located. The interested reader is referred to the book by
Hammond (1981) for an illuminating proof that neither D nor
E is more fundamental.
