When an electron breaks away from its covalent 
bond, the space previously occupied by the electron 
is referred to as a hole (Figure 28-4). As described in 
Chapter 11, a hole simply represents the absence of an 
electron. Because an electron has a negative charge, 
its absence represents the loss of a negative charge. A 
hole thus has the characteristic of a positively charged 
particle. As an electron jumps from one valence shell 
to another valence shell with a hole, it leaves a hole 
behind it. If this action continues, the hole appears to 
move in the opposite direction to the electron.
