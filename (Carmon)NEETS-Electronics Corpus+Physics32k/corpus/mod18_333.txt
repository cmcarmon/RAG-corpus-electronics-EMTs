Maximum use of the received signals is ensured by an atr tube. The transmitted pulse travels from
the magnetron to the atr branch where part of the energy is diverted into the gap. A slot (S) is placed
across the waveguide one-half wavelength from the main guide, and passes the rf energy through it and
into the cavity. The cavity builds up the electric field that breaks down the gap, detunes the cavity, and, as
a result, effectively closes the slot. One-half wavelength away, this action effectively closes the entrance
to the atr branch and limits the amount of energy entering the atr branch to a small value.
