The use of the auxiliary winding is limited only to starting—the motor runs more efﬁciently without it, as
a  single  phase  motor  described  earlier.  A  switch,  activated  by  speed  (centrifugal)  or  by  stator  temperature,
disconnects the auxiliary winding shortly after starting. Figure 66.19 represents schematically the connections
of this type of motor.
