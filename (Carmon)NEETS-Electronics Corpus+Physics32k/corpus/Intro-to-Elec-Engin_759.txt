8.3.11 Starting from Equations (8.3.9), (8.3.11), and
(8.3.12), show that equations (8.3.13) through
(8.3.15) hold for ro → ∞.
8.3.12 Consider the CC BJT ampliﬁer circuit shown in
Figure 8.3.2(a) with R1 = 150 k, R2 = 150 k,
RE = 2 k, RL = 3 k, and VCC = 10 V. The
BJT has β = 100, ICQ = 1.2 mA, and VA = 75
V. Determine Ri, Rin, Av1, and Ai.
