The primary advantage of the electrodynamometer-type meter movement is that it can be used to
measure alternating as well as direct current. If you apply alternating current to the standard
galvanometer-type meter, it will not produce a usable reading. Instead, the meter will vibrate at or near
the zero reading. On one-half cycle of the ac, the meter is deflected to the left and on the other half cycle
