Parametrized signals also arise in situations in which it is not appropriate to model the unknown parameters
as random variables with a known distribution. In such cases, it is not possible to compute the likelihood ratio
(73.6) so an alternative to the likelihood ratio detector must then be used. (An exception is that in which the
likelihood ratio detector is invariant to the unknown parametersâ€”a case known as  uniformly most powerful
detection.) Several alternatives to the likelihood ratio detector exist for these cases.
