The importance of radio lay not simply in its expansion of the means of human communication over
distances, but also in its exploitation and expansion of very novel scientiﬁc and technical capabilities. As
the  century  progressed,  radio  would  give  rise  to  the  20th  century’s  most  revolutionary  technology  of
all — electronics. (Courtesy of the IEEE Center for the History of Electrical Engineering.)
