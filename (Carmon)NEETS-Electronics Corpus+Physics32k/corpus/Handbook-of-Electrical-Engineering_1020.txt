Skew parameter values are obtained usually by tracking a few key parameters, measuring many wafers over
a  long  period  of  time.  The  standard  deviation  of  these  key  parameters  is  found  and  added  to  or  subtracted
from  the  typical  parameter  values  to  obtain  the  skew  models.  This  method  is  extremely  crude  and  will  not
normally  produce  a  realistic  skew  model.  It  will  almost  always  overestimate  the  process  spread,  because  the
various model parameters are not independentâ€”they are correlated.
