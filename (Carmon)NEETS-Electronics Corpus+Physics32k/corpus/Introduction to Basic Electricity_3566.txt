Figure 35-18 shows LEDs arranged to form a seven-
segment display used for digital readouts. Figure 35-19 
shows an LED used in conjunction with a phototran-
sistor to form an optical coupler. Both devices are 
housed in the same package. An optical	coupler 
consists of an LED and a phototransistor. The output 
of the optical coupler is coupled to the input using 
light produced by the LED.
