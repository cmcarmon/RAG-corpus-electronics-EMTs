A rough rule of thumb can predict that number of defect removal operations that are normally carried out
for software projects. Using the Function Point total of the application as the starting point, calculate the 0.3rd
power, and express the result as an integer. Thus an application of 100 Function Points in size would normally
employ a series of 4 defect removal operations. An application of 1000 Function Points in size would normally
employ a series of 8 defect removal operations. An application of 10,000 Function Points in size would normally
employ 16 defect removal operations.
