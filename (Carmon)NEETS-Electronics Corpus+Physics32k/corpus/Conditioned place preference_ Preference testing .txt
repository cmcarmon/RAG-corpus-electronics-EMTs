In the preference testing phase the animal is allowed barrier free access to all compartments of the apparatus. Time spent in each compartment is measured either by the experimenter or by motion detecting software; often the mean seconds per minute spent in each compartment is calculated. Statistical testing is used to determine whether the time difference is large enough, in comparison to the control group, to conclude that conditioned place preference or aversion has occurred. Strength of conditioning is inferred by the magnitude of the difference or in the amount of time taken for the response to show extinction.
