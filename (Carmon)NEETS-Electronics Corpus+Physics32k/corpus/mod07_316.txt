The basic operation of the SCR can be compared to that of the thyratron. The thyratron is an electron 
tube, normally gas filled, that uses a filament or a heater. The SCR and the thyratron function in a very 
similar manner. Figure 3-21 shows the schematic of each with the corresponding elements labeled. In 
both types of devices, control by the input signal is lost after they are triggered. The control grid 
(thyratron) and the gate (SCR) have no further effect on the magnitude of the load current after 
conduction begins. The load current can be interrupted by one or more of three methods: (1) the load 
circuit must be opened by a switch, (2) the plate (anode) voltage must be reduced below the ionizing 
potential of the gas (thyratron), (3) the forward-bias current must be reduced below a minimum value 
required to sustain conduction (SCR). The input resistance of the SCR is relatively low (approximately 
100 ohms) and requires a current for triggering; the input resistance of the thyratron is exceptionally high, 
and requires a voltage input to the grid for triggering action.
