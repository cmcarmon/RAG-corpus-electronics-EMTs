15.1.37 Two stations (using identical antennas, with di-
ameters of 50λ and aperture efﬁciencies of 0.6 at
35 GHz) are separated by 30 km. With negligible
antenna losses, antenna connection-path losses are
Lt = Lr = 1.33 at a physical temperature of 285
K, while the antenna temperature is 85 K. The re-
ceiver at either station has Ga(f 0)= 107, ¯TR = 250
K, and BN = 12 MHz. The rain attenuation and
clear-air attenuation are given to be 3.9 dB/km
and 0.072 dB/km, respectively. Determine:
(a) The required output power to guarantee a sys-
tem signal-to-noise power ratio of 45 dB when
heavy rain falls over a distance of 6 km.
