Other non-idealities include the distributed series resistance, and even series
inductance, that arises in foil-wound capacitors in particular. These character-
istics limit the power-handling capability of a real capacitor, and the frequency
range over which a real capacitor behaves like an ideal capacitor. They can often
be explicitly modeled with a single series resistor and inductor, respectively.
