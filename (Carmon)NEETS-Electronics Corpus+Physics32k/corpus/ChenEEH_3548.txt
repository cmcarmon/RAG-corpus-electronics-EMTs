, is unity, then
the system is said to ideally pass the input signal content at
frequency v0 to the output. The set of all such frequencies is
called the passband of the system. If H(ejv0 )
is zero, then the
system is said to ideally stop the input signal content at
frequency v0 from appearing at the output. The set of all
such frequencies is called the stopband of the system.
j  p is partitioned into
passbands and stopbands, then the system is called an ideal
ﬁlter that passes or stops the signal content in a frequency-
selective manner. A ﬁlter is said to be ideal low-pass if its
frequency response is the following:
vj
j < vc:
j < vj
j
vc
