The  radial  basis  function  (RBF)  network  constitutes  another  way  of  implementing  arbitrary  input/output
mappings. The most signiÔ¨Åcant difference between the MLP and RBF lies in the PE nonlinearity. While the PE
in the MLP responds to the full input space, the PE in the RBF is local, normally a Gaussian kernel in the input
space. Hence, it only responds to inputs that are close to its center; i.e., it has basically a local response.
