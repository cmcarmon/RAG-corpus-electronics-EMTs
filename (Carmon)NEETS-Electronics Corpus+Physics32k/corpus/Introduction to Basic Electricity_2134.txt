In the circuit, RX is the unknown resistor value. 
RC  is  a  potentiometer  and  is  adjusted  until  the  
voltage from the second voltage divider is equal to 
voltage from the voltage divider containing RX. When 
the voltage values are equal, the bridge balanced. The 
balance point can be detected by connecting either a 
voltmeter or an ammeter across the output terminals. 
Both meters will give a zero reading when a balance is 
achieved.
