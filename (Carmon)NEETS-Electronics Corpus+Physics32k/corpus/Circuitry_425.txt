comparator are shown in Fig. 8.18. Notice how the 
output  is  either  +15V  or  â€“15V  depending  on  the 
relative  polarity  of  the  two  input.  A  typical 
application for a comparator is that of comparing a  
signal voltage with a reference voltage. The output 
will go high (or low) in order to signal the result of 
the comparison. 
 
Summing amplifiers 
 
A summing  amplifier  using  an  operational 
amplifier  is  shown  in  Fig.  8.19.  This  circuit 
produces an output that is the sum of its two input
