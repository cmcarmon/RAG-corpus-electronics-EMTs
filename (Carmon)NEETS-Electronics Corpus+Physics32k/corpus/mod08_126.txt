A more common configuration for transistor amplifiers is the common-emitter configuration. 
Positive feedback is a little more difficult with this configuration because the input and output signals are 
180ยบ out of phase. Positive feedback can be accomplished by feeding a portion of the output signal of the 
second stage back to the input of the first stage. This arrangement is shown in figure 1-19.
