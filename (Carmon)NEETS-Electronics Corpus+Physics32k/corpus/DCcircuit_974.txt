To solve this network using Branch Currents, we’d have to establish ﬁve variables to ac-
count for each and every unique current in the circuit (I1 through I5). This would require
ﬁve equations for solution, in the form of two KCL equations and three KVL equations (two
equations for KCL at the nodes, and three equations for KVL in each loop):
