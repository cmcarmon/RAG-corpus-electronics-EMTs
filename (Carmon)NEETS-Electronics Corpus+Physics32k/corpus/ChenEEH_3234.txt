transformers may use dead-front conﬁguration with separable
insulated connectors or elbows. There are many other combi-
nations of pad-mount construction and accessory equipment
available including live-front primary connections with stress
cones for the cables, internal or external primary fuses and
switches, and secondary breakers. Residential subsurface
transformers (RSTs) are used much less frequently. RSTs are
installed in relatively tight-ﬁtting vaults with the cover grating
of the vault at ground level. Cooling is usually accomplished by
natural convection of air. RSTs are submersible and, therefore,
have dead-front primary cable terminations. Switches, fuses,
and circuit breakers are located on the cover of the transformer
so that they can be operated by a lineman standing on the
surface of the ground. The last type of URD transformer is a
direct-buried transformer. This type of transformer is not
popular because of the problem of accessory equipment and
its poor operation under adverse weather conditions, such as
with snow and ice. There also are concerns about galvanic
corrosion under certain conditions.
