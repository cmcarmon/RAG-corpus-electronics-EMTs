where Fuv stands for ac coefﬁcients in the block and where the
encoded block is 8  8 as in image/video coding standards.
Shen and Sethi (1996) also propose fast coarse-edge detection
techniques using DCT coefﬁcients. A comparison of their
approach with edge detection techniques in spatial domain
speaks in favor of DCT coefﬁcients based-edge detection be-
cause a coarse representation of edges is quite sufﬁcient for
content description purposes.
