A modern computer system consists of one or more proces-
sors, some main memory, clocks, terminals, disks, network
interfaces, and other input/output devices. Writing programs
that keep track of all these components and use them correctly
is an extremely difﬁcult job. The operating system puts a layer
of software on top of the bare hardware, manages all parts of
the system, and presents the user with an interface or virtual
machine that is easier to understand and program. Thus, an
operating system can be deﬁned as a set of software extensions
of primitive hardware, culminating in a virtual machine that
serves as a high-level programming environment and manages
the ﬂow of work in a network of computers.
