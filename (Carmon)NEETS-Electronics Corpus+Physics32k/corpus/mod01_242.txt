Resistance is a property of every electrical component. At times, its effects will be undesirable.
However, resistance is used in many varied ways. RESISTORS are components manufactured to possess
specific values of resistance. They are manufactured in many types and sizes. When drawn using its
schematic representation, a resistor is shown as a series of jagged lines, as illustrated in figure 1-29.
