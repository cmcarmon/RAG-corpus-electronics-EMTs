A major purpose of variable refresh rates is the elimination of stutters and tearing by keeping refresh rates in sync with a varying frame rate from a video game. This makes display motion more smooth despite a varying frame rate.
Another purpose is power management, by temporarily lowering the refresh rate of a display to save battery power on a laptop or mobile device.
Also, a variable refresh rate allow a display to correctly display any arbitrary film or video frame rate within the refresh rate range supported by a display.
