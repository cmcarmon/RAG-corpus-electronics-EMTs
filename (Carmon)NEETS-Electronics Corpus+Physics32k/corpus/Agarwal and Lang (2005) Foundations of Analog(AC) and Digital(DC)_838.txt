Output voltage levels are generally stricter than input voltage levels (higher
than the corresponding input high and lower than the corresponding input low)
to provide for noise margins. Figure 6.26 illustrates the asymmetry between
inputs and outputs. At the input of the gate, any voltage level lower than VIL
is recognized as a valid low, and any voltage higher than VIH is a valid high. At
its output, the gate guarantees to produce a voltage level higher than VOH for
a valid high, and a voltage level lower than VOL for a valid low.
