range. Because the amount of current passing through most electronic 
circuits can be measured in milliamps (mA), you can start with a range 
of 200 mA and dial it down to 20 mA if the reading is less than 20 mA. For 
the resistor‚ÄêLED circuit (refer to Figure 16-9), select a range of 10 mA or 
20 mA, depending on what your multimeter offers.
