A number of blocks make up a ﬁle identiﬁed by a tape ﬁle marker which is written to the tape by the tape
controller. The entire length of tape is enclosed between the beginning and end of tape markers. These normally
consist of a photosensitive material that triggers sensors on the read/write heads. When a new tape is loaded,
it normally advances to the beginning of a tape marker and then it is ready for access by the CPU. The end of
tape marker is used to prevent the tape from running off the end of the tape spool and indicates the limit of
the storage length.
