Radiated Emission Testing. The radiated emissions are measured at an FCC listed site (either semi-anechoic
or open ﬁeld), which requires a metal ground plane over the ﬂoor (typically hardware cloth). The site must
satisfy  a  certain  minimum  size  criteria,  depending  on  the  prescribed  measurement  distance.  The  accepted
criteria is based on the Fresnel ellipse, which is presented in Fig. 40.18. The procedure for listing a site with
the FCC includes the submittal of the site attenuation measurements, the site description, and a list of mea-
surement equipment. The qualiﬁed site should meet the –4-dB variation from theoretical values.
