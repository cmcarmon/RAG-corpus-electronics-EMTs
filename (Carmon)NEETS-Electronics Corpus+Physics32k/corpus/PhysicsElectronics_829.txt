Counters are also classiﬁed by their clearing and preloading abilities. The BCD type count is
decimal, and is most often used for displays. In the synchronous counter each clock pulse is
fed simultaneously or synchronously to all ﬂip-ﬂops. For the ripple counter, the clock pulse
is applied only to the ﬁrst ﬂip-ﬂop in the array and its output is the clock to the second
ﬂip-ﬂop, etc.. The clock is said to ripple through the ﬂip-ﬂop array.
