At Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from selected critics, Shattered Horizon has received a score of 72/100 which indicates "mixed or average reviews".
GameSpot rated Shattered Horizon 7.5/10, praising the handling of zero-gravity movement, atmospheric environments and the unique and deep combat mechanics, but citing the system requirements (particularly the requirement of DirectX 10) and the lack of single player game modes, levels and tutorial or bot support as its major setbacks.
Post-launch, developer Futuremark Games Studio addressed some of the common criticisms by releasing several free updates to the game. The Moonrise map pack released February 16, 2010 added four new levels, the Firepower weapons pack released May 5, 2010 introduced new weapons and grenades and the Last Stand pack released March 17, 2011 introduced single player options with bots and a new game mode.
