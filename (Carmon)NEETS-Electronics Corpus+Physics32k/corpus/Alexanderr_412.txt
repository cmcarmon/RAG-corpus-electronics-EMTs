This is a second-order differential equation and is the reason for call-
ing  the  RLC circuits  in  this  chapter  second-order  circuits.  Our  goal  is
to  solve  Eq.  (8.4).  To  solve  such  a  second-order  differential  equation
requires  that  we  have  two  initial  conditions,  such  as  the  initial  value
of  i and  its  Ô¨Årst  derivative  or  initial  values  of  some  i and 
The  ini-
tial  value  of  i is  given  in  Eq.  (8.2b).  We  get  the  initial  value  of  the
derivative of i from Eqs. (8.2a) and (8.3); that is,
