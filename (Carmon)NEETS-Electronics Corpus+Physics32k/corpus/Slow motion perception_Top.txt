Slow motion perception is a postulated mental state wherein time seems to be slowed down. People experiencing life-threatening situations sometimes report that time seemed to have slowed down.
Slow motion perception is a very conflicted area of research right now with many different theories. Research conducted by David Eagleman established that time does not actually slow down for a person during a life-threatening event but, rather, it is only a retrospective assessment that brings about such a conclusion. He measured time perception during free-fall by strapping palm-top computers to subjects' wrists and having them perform psychophysical experiments as they fall. By measuring their speed of information intake, he concluded that participants did not have increased temporal resolution during the fall but, because their memories are more densely packed during a frightening situation, the event merely seems to have taken longer. However, this experiment did not take into account a subject's level of focus on performing a useful action, which seems, according to new research by the University College London's Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, to actually slow down time perception. In addition, an analysis of multiple other experiments spanning from the 1970s to 2010s, including Eagleman's study, by Valtteri Arstila suggests that while Eagleman's theory may not be wrong, in some cases it seems time perception does indeed slow down. Furthermore, research into stimulant-dependent subjects show a consistent change in time for processing visual and other information when under the effects. Therefore, while some cases of danger may not spark slow motion perception merely causing a similar effect in memories, it seems that in other cases time perception actually does slow down.
