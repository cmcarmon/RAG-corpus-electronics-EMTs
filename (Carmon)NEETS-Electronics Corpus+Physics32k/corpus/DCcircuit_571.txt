It is quite easy to confuse these two equations, getting the resistance ratios backwards. One
way to help remember the proper form is to keep in mind that both ratios in the voltage and
current divider equations must equal less than one. After all these are divider equations, not
multiplier equations! If the fraction is upside-down, it will provide a ratio greater than one,
which is incorrect. Knowing that total resistance in a series (voltage divider) circuit is always
greater than any of the individual resistances, we know that the fraction for that formula must
be Rn over RT otal. Conversely, knowing that total resistance in a parallel (current divider)
circuit is always less then any of the individual resistances, we know that the fraction for that
formula must be RT otal over Rn.
