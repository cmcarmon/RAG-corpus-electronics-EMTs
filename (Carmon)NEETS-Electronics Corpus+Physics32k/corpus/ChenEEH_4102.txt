characteristics. The process to correct channel-induced distor-
tion is referred to as equalization. The adjustable ﬁlter is called
an equalizer. Equalizers may be preset or adaptive. The
parameters of a preset equalizer are adjusted by making
measurements of channel impulse response and solving a set
of equations for the parameters using these measurements. An
adaptive equalizer is automatically adjusted by sending a
known signal through the channel and allowing the equalizer
to adjust its own parameters in response to this known signal.
A transversal ﬁlter—a delay line with T-second taps (where
T is the symbol duration)—is a common choice for the equal-
izer. The outputs of the taps are ampliﬁed, summed, and fed to
a decision device. The tap coefﬁcients Cn are set to subtract the
effects of interference from symbols that are adjacent in time to
the desired symbol. The output samples yk of the equalizer are
written as:
