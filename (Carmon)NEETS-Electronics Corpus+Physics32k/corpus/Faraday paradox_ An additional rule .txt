In the case when the disk alone spins there is no change in flux through the circuit, however, there is an electromotive force induced contrary to Faraday's law. We can also show an example when there is a change in flux, but no induced voltage. Figure 5 (near right) shows the setup used in Tilley's experiment. It is a circuit with two loops or meshes. There is a galvanometer connected in the right-hand loop, a magnet in the center of the left-hand loop, a switch in the left-hand loop, and a switch between the loops. We start with the switch on the left open and that on the right closed. When the switch on the left is closed and the switch on the right is open there is no change in the field of the magnet, but there is a change in the area of the galvanometer circuit. This means that there is a change in flux. However the galvanometer did not deflect meaning there was no induced voltage, and Faraday's law does not work in this case. According to A. G. Kelly this suggests that an induced voltage in Faraday's experiment is due to the "cutting" of the circuit by the flux lines, and not by "flux linking" or the actual change in flux. This follows from the Tilley experiment because there is no movement of the lines of force across the circuit and therefore no current induced although there is a change in flux through the circuit. Nussbaum suggests that for Faraday's law to be valid, work must be done in producing the change in flux.
To understand this idea, we will step through the argument given by Nussbaum. We start by calculating the force between two current carrying wires. The force on wire 1 due to wire 2 is given by:






F

{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{21}={\frac {\mu _{0}}{4\pi }}I_{1}I_{2}\oint _{C_{1}}\oint _{C_{2}}{\frac {d\mathbf {l_{1}} \ \mathbf {\times } \ (d\mathbf {l_{2}} \ \mathbf {\times } \ {\hat {\mathbf {r} }}_{21})}{r_{21}^{2}}}\ }


The magnetic field from the second wire is given by:

So we can rewrite the force on wire 1 as:






F

{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{21}=I_{1}\oint _{C_{1}}d\mathbf {l_{1}} \ \mathbf {\times } \mathbf {B} _{2}}


Now consider a segment



d

{\displaystyle d\mathbf {l} }
of a conductor displaced



d

r



{\displaystyle d\mathbf {r} }
in a constant magnetic field. The work done is found from:




d
W

F

⋅
d

r



{\displaystyle dW=d\mathbf {F} \cdot d\mathbf {r} }


If we plug in what we previously found for

{\displaystyle d\mathbf {F} }
we get:

{\displaystyle dW=(Id\mathbf {l} \mathbf {\times } \mathbf {B} )\cdot d\mathbf {r} }

{\displaystyle dW=I\mathbf {B} \cdot d\mathbf {S} =Id\Phi _{B}}


The differential work can also be given in terms of charge

{\displaystyle V}

By setting the two equations for differential work equal to each other we arrive at Faraday's Law.

{\displaystyle d\Phi _{B}=Vdt}


Furthermore, we now see that this is only true if



d
W


{\displaystyle dW}
is non-vanishing. Meaning, Faraday's Law is only valid if work is performed in bringing about the change in flux.
A mathematical way to validate Faraday's Law in these kind of situations is to generalize the definition of EMF as in the proof of Faraday's law of induction:




E

{\displaystyle EMF=\oint \left(\mathbf {E} +\mathbf {v} \times \mathbf {B} \right)\cdot {\text{d}}{\boldsymbol {\ell }}}

The galvanometer usually only measures the first term in the EMF which contributes the current in circuit, although sometimes it can measure the incorporation of the second term such as when the second term contributes part of the current which the galvanometer measures as motional EMF, e.g. in the Faraday's disk experiment. In the situation above, the first term is zero and only the first term leads a current that the galvanometer measures, so there is no induced voltage. However, Faraday's Law still holds since the apparent change of the magnetic flux goes to the second term in the above generalization of EMF. But it is not measured by the galvanometer. Remember




v



{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} }
is the local velocity of a point on the circuit, not a charge carrier. After all, both/all these situations are consistent with the concern of relativity and microstructure of matter, and/or the completeness of Maxwell equation and Lorentz formula, or the combination of them, Hamiltonian mechanics.
