In the preceding section, several basic voltage and current
measurement
instruments were discussed. Because power
quality measurements are often demanding in bandwidth
and dynamic range, several types of advanced instrumentation
techniques have been studied and developed for this applica-
tion. A few are listed in Table 10.7.
