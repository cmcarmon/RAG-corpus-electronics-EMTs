 The L/R TIME CONSTANT is a valuable tool for use in determining the time required for current in 
an inductor to reach a specific value. As shown in figure 2-11, one L/R time constant is the time required 
for the current in an inductor to increase to 63 percent (actually 63.2 percent) of the maximum current. 
Each time constant is equal to the time required for the current to increase by 63.2 percent of the 
difference in value between the current flowing in the inductor and the maximum current. Maximum 
current flows in the inductor after five L/R time constants are completed. The following example should 
clear up any confusion about time constants. Assume that maximum current in an LR circuit is 10 
amperes. As you know, when the circuit is energized, it takes time for the current to go from zero to 10 
amperes. When the first time constant is completed, the current in the circuit is equal to 63.2% of 10 
amperes. Thus the amplitude of current at the end of 1 time constant is 6.32 amperes.
