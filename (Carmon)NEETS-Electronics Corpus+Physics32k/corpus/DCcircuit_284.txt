The amount of current through a body is equal to the amount of voltage applied between
two points on that body, divided by the electrical resistance offered by the body between those
two points. Obviously, the more voltage available to cause electrons to ﬂow, the easier they
will ﬂow through any given amount of resistance. Hence, the danger of high voltage: high
voltage means potential for large amounts of current through your body, which will injure or
kill you. Conversely, the more resistance a body offers to current, the slower electrons will ﬂow
for any given amount of voltage. Just how much voltage is dangerous depends on how much
total resistance is in the circuit to oppose the ﬂow of electrons.
