Example 13.8 
 
If the aerial in Example 13.7 has a d.c. resistance of 
2 O, determine  the  power  loss  and  the  radiation 
efficiency of the aerial. 
 
Solution 
 
From the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 13.22, the 
current that flows in the d.c. resistance of the aerial, 
Rd.c., is the same as that which flows in its radiation 
resistance, Rr. Thus  Ia = 0.5 A and Rd.c. = 2 O
