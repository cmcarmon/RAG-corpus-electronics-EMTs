where v0 is the voltage on the capacitor at t = 0. Just before S1 is opened and S2 is
closed, there was a current of V/R flowing in the inductor and a voltage v0 on the
capacitor. Therefore, these are our initial conditions. The initial voltage on the capacitor
v0 will be 0 when the circuit starts from rest. If there is no load resistor connected to
the capacitor, then this voltage will simply be the final value on the capacitor from the
previous charging cycle.
