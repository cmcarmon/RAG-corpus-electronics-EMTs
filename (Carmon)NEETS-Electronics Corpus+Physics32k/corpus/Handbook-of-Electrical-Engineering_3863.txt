To get an idea of the operating range of the log-periodic antenna, note that for a given frequency within the
operating range of the antenna, there will be one dipole in the array that is half-wave resonant or is nearly so.
This  half-wave  resonant  dipole  and  its  immediate  neighbors  are  called  the  active  region  of  the  log-periodic
array. As the operating frequency changes, the active region shifts to a different part of the log-periodic. Hence,
the  frequency  range  for  the  log-periodic  array  is  roughly  given  by  the  frequencies  at  which  the  longest  and
shortest  dipoles  in  the  array  are  half-wave  resonant  (wavelengths  such  that  2LN  < l  <  2L1 )  [Stutzman  and
Thiele, 1981].
