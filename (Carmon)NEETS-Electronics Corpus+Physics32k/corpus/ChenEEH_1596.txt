. Component-based approach: A model represents the
topological structure of the target system, consisting of
components,
that ï¬‚ow
through connections (deKleer and Brown, 1984). The
behavior of each component is described by a set of
local properties (i.e., relationships between inputs, in-
ternal states, and outputs).
