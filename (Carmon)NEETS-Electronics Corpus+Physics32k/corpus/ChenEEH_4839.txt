The third common way of integrating components is with
Java-based technologies. Java is an object-oriented language
that is platform independent and is open source (meaning that
the source code is not proprietary), so it has good promise for
use in middleware development. Java is based on a layered
architecture with new APIs being developed on a continuing
basis. Some of the APIs that enable Java to be used for distrib-
uted applications are the Remote Method Invocation (RMI)
API, the RMI over Internet Inter-ORB Protocol (IIOP) API,
and the Java ORB API. The RMI API provides the means for
distributed objects to interface through remote method calls
(similar to remote procedure calls but specialized to Java
objects). The RMI IIOP API provides the remote method call
capability using a CORBA ORB. The Java ORB API provides a
Java-based CORBA ORB. It should be noted that Java com-
ponents can interact with non-Java components (such as those
written in C) through the use of the Java Native Interface
