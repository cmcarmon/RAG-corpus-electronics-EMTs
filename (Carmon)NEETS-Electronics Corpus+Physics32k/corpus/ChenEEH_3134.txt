The shaded-pole induction motor does not use an auxiliary
winding. Rather, there is a shorted turn or turns on part of the
stator pole. The portion of the ﬂux crossing the air gap
through this turn produces an eddy current reaction, which
effectively delays the ﬂux. This produces a traveling wave that
enables the motor to start. The starting torque is not as great as
in the capacitor motors, but these motors are very reliable and
inexpensive. They are often used in appliances where efﬁciency
and torque requirements are not great.
