One should not interpret the 17-year life cycle as meaning that no work is being performed that is relevant
to a generation before the 17-year period begins. For example, many organizations are conducting experiments
m
m.  This  author’s  interpretation  is  that  when  basic
directed  at  transistors  with  gate  lengths  smaller  than  0.1 
research efforts have explored technology boundary conditions, the conditions are ripe for a speciﬁc generation
to  begin  to  coalesce  as  a  unique  entity.  When  a  body  of  research  begins  to  seek  compatible  materials  and
processes to enable design and production at the target feature size, the generation life cycle begins. This is a
rather diffused activity at ﬁrst, and it becomes more focused as the cycle proceeds.
