In the spherical bases denoted e+, e−, e0, and associated coordinates with respect to this basis, denoted A+, A−, A0, the vector A is:

where the spherical basis vectors can be defined in terms of the Cartesian basis using complex-valued coefficients in the xy plane:

in which i denotes the imaginary unit, and one normal to the plane in the z direction:
