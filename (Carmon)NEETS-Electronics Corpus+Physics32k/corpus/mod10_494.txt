Transmission line characteristics are based on an infinite line. A line cannot always be terminated in
its characteristic impedance since it is sometimes operated as an OPEN-ENDED line and other times as a
SHORT-CIRCUIT at the receiving end. If the line is open-ended, it has a terminating impedance that is
infinitely large. If a line is not terminated in characteristic impedance, it is said to be finite.
