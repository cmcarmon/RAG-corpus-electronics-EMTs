DRT
The  diagnostic  rhyme  test  (DRT)  was  devised  by Voiers  [1977]  to  test  the  intelligibility  of  coders  known  to
produce speech of lower quality. Rhyme tests are so named because the listener must determine which consonant
was spoken when presented with a pair of rhyming words; that is, the listener is asked to distinguish between
word pairs such as meat-beat, pool-tool, saw-thaw, and caught-taught. Each pair of words differs on only one
of six phonemic attributes: voicing, nasality, sustention, sibilation, graveness, and compactness. Speciﬁcally, the
listener is presented with one spoken word from a pair and asked to decide which word was spoken. The ﬁnal
