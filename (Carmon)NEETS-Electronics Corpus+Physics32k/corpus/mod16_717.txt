21 VIDEO FILTER One of two (NARROW OR WIDE) filters can be activated to reduce video
bandwidth and high-frequency components for display noise averaging. The
narrow filter is approximately 1/300th of the selected resolution bandwidth with
the wide filter being 1/30th the bandwidth. Activating either one will cancel the
other. To disable, completely switch filter off.
