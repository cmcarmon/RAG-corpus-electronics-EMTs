Private Branch Exchange
Historically, private branch exchanges (PBXs) were privately owned telephone switching computers that would
be placed in the basement of a building and serve to interconnect phones in the building and provide access
to outside lines provided by common carriers. However, PBXs are now available that offer both telephone and
data service. In a typical system a phone may have a data socket for terminals or workstations. PBXs are wired
in a star topology with the PBX at the center of the star and each user wired directly to it.
