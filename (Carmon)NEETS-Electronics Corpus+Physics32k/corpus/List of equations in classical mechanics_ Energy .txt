The mechanical work done by an external agent on a system is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the system:
General work-energy theorem (translation and rotation)
The work done W by an external agent which exerts a force F (at r) and torque τ on an object along a curved path C is:

{\displaystyle W=\Delta T=\int _{C}\left(\mathbf {F} \cdot \mathrm {d} \mathbf {r} +{\boldsymbol {\tau }}\cdot \mathbf {n} {\mathrm {d} \theta }\right)}

where θ is the angle of rotation about an axis defined by a unit vector n.
