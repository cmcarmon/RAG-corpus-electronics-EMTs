A unified primary is a proposed electoral system that restricts the field of candidates in an election to the top two approved candidates in a two-round election. The unified primary has two fundamental characteristics: the top two candidates, even if members of the same party, will appear on the second round ballot paper, and voters may vote for (approve) any number of candidates for a single office in a first nonpartisan blanket primary.
