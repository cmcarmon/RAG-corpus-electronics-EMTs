New Microcell System
The  conventional  microcell  system  [Lee,  Nov.  1991,  1993]  reduces  the  transmit  power  and  makes  a  cell  less
than 1 km in radius. The concept of using cell splitting is to increase capacity. Furthermore, the new microcell
system needs to Ô¨Ånd a way to make a conventional microcell to be intelligent. The conventional microcell does
not have the intelligence to know where the mobile or portable units are located within the cell. Therefore, the
cell site has to cover the signal strength over the whole cell or whole sector. The more unnecessary signal power
transmitted, the more interference will be caused in the system and less capacity will be achieved. In this new
intelligent microcell system, each cell is an intelligent cell. In a new microcell, there are three or more zones.
The cell will know which zone a particular mobile unit is in. Then a small amount of power will be needed to
 
(CIRF)  now  will  be  measured  from  two
deliver  in  that  zone.  The  cochannel  interference  reduction  factor
cochannel zones instead of two cochannel cells. Then the two cochannel cells can be located much closer. In
  =  3.  As  compared  to  the  conventional
this  new  microcell  system,  the  frequency  reuse  factor 
 = 7, the new microcell system has a capacity increase of 2.33 (= 7/3) times. These two techniques
microcell 
can be used in buildings and outside buildings.
