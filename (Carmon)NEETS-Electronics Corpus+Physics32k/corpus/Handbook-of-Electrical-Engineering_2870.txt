6” X 8”), with a medium density of components, a typical mix of active and passive parts on the topside and
only passive and 3- or 4-terminal active parts on bottomside, there may be in excess of 1000 solder joints per
board.  If  solder  joints  are  manufactured  at  the  3  sigma  level  (99.73%  good  joints,  or  0.27%  defect  rate,  or
!! At the 6 sigma level, of 3.4 PPM, there
2700 defects per 1 million joints), 
will be a defect on 1 board out of every 294 boards produced. If your anticipated production level is 1000 units
per day, you will have 3.4 rejects based solely on solder joint problems, not counting other sources of defects.
Solder paste may be deposited by syringe, or by screen or stencil printing techniques. Stencil techniques are
best for high-volume/speed production although they do require a speciﬁc stencil for each board design. Syringe
and  screen  techniques  may  be  used  for  high-volume  lines  and  are  also  suited  to  mixed-product  lines  where
only small volumes of a given board design are to have solder paste deposited. Syringe deposition is the only
solder paste technique that can be used on boards which already have some components mounted. It is also
well suited for prototype lines and for any use requires only software changes to develop a different deposition
pattern.
