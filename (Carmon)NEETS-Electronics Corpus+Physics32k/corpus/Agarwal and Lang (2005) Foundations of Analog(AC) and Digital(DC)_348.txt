To develop our intuition,
let us first illustrate the method with the simple
voltage divider in Figure 2.50a. Suppose we were interested in determining the
voltage across resistor R2. The figure shows a few important variables marked
on it. An intuitive way of analyzing the circuit is to replace the two resistors by
the series equivalent, as in Figure 2.50b, then find i1 using Ohmâ€™s law. From
Equation 2.56, the equivalent series resistance is given by
