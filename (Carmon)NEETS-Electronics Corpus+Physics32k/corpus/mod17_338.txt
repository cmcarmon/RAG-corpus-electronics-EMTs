The teletypewriter signal is theoretically a perfect signal. The time between each unit remains the 
same during transmission of the signal. The shift from mark to space (and vice versa) is called a 
TRANSITION. A transition occurs at the beginning and end of each unit when it shifts from mark to 
space or space to mark; a character may have two, four, or six transitions.
