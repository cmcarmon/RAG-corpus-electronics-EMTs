Newton's law of universal gravitation states that the gravitational force F acting between two point masses m1 and m2 with centre of mass separation r is given by

{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =-G{\frac {m_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}}\mathbf {\hat {r}} }

where G is the gravitational constant and r̂ is the radial unit vector. For an object of continuous mass distribution, each mass element dm can be treated as a point mass, so the volume integral over the extent of the object gives:

with corresponding gravitational potential

where ρ = ρ(x, y, z) is the mass density at the volume element and of the direction from the volume element to the point mass.
