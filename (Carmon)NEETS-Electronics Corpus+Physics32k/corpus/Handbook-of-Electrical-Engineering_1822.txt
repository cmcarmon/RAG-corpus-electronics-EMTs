Multidimensional signal processing tools apply to aperture and sensor array processing. Planar sensor arrays
can be considered to be sampled apertures. Three-dimensional or volumetric arrays can be viewed as multidi-
mensional spatial ﬁlters. Therefore, the topics of sensor array processing, aperture processing, and multidimen-
sional  signal  processing  can  be  studied  under  a  uniﬁed  format.  The  basic  function  of  the  receiving  array  is
transduction of propagating waves in the medium into electrical signals. Propagating waves are fundamental
in radar, communication, optics, sonar, and geophysics. In electromagnetic applications, basic transducers are
antennas and arrays of antennas. A large body of literature that exists on antennas and antenna arrays can be
exploited  in  the  areas  of  aperture  and  sensor  array  processing.  Much  of  the  antenna  literature  deals  with
transmitting  antennas  and  their  radiation  patterns.  Because  of  the  reciprocity  of  transmitting  and  receiving
transducers, key results that have been developed for transmitters can be used for analysis of receiver aperture
and/or array processing. Transmitting transducers radiate energy in desired directions, whereas receiving aper-
tures/arrays act as spatial ﬁlters that emphasize signals from a desired look direction while discriminating against
interferences from other directions. The spatial ﬁlter wavenumber response is called the receiver beam pattern.
Transmitting apertures are characterized by their radiation patterns.
