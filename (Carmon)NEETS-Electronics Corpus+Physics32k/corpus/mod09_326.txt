There are several different varieties of pulsed oscillators for different applications. The schematic 
diagram shown in figure 2-25, view (A), is an emitter-loaded pulsed oscillator. The tank circuit can be 
placed in the collector circuit, in which case it is referred to as a collector-loaded pulsed oscillator. The 
difference between the emitter-loaded and the collector-loaded oscillator is in the output signal. The first 
alternation of an emitter-loaded npn pulsed oscillator is negative. The first alternation of the collector-
loaded pulsed oscillator is positive. If a pnp is used, the oscillator will reverse the first alternation of both 
the emitter-loaded and the collector-loaded oscillator.
