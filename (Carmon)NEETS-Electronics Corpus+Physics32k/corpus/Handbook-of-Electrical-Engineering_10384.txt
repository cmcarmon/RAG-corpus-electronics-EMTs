In the absence of a tail, control of the X-36 is accomplished by a combination of thrust vectoring and
innovative aerodynamic control features. Tailless ﬁghter conﬁgurations offer reduced weight, increased
range, and improvement in survivability. The X-36 is “ﬂown” by a pilot located in a van at the ﬂight test
facility; a camera in the XX-36 cockpit relays instrument readings and displays to a console in the van.
With a wing span of only 10.4 feet and a gross weight under 1,300 pounds, the X-36 is powered by a
single turbofan originally designed as a cruise missile power plant.
