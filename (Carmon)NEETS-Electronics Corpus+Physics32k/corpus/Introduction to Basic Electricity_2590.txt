The voltage in a parallel circuit (Figure 23-5) remains 
constant across each individual branch. However, the 
total current divides among the individual branches. 
In a parallel AC circuit, the total current is in phase 
with the applied voltage (Figure 23-6). The individual 
currents are also in phase with the applied voltage.
