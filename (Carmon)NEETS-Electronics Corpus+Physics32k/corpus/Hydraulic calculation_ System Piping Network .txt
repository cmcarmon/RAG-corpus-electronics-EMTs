Suppression system piping networks are usually arranged in one of 3 configurations: Tree, Loop, or Grid. Tree systems may be imagined as a network of piping starting with a larger trunk and branching out to progressively smaller pipes with fire sprinklers or other devices. Looped systems may have a larger pipe that runs throughout a building and ties back to itself near the start, with smaller branches reaching out from this 'loop'. A gridded system may be imagined as similar to the lines on a gridiron football field, where the sidelines would be 2 parallel larger 'main' pipes and the yardage lines would be smaller 'branch' lines connecting the two sidelines. Gridded systems provide multiple paths for the water to travel to any point in the system. This arrangement can be very effective at reducing friction pressure losses in the system.
Most design standards require application of the Hazen-Williams method for determining frictional pressure losses through the piping network as water passes through it. Tree and Loop systems are simple enough that the hydraulic calculations could be performed by hand. Because hydraulic calculations for gridded systems require an iterative process to balance the water flow through all possible water paths, these calculations are most often performed by computer software. Today most calculations on all types of piping networks are performed by computer software. The sizes of network components can be more readily modified and recalculated on a computer than through a manual process.
The 2013 NFPA 13 Handbook includes a supplement  that describes some of the application theory and processes applied when performing hydraulic calculations.
