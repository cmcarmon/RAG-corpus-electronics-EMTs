When  a  transformer  is  operated  without  a  load 
 (FigureÂ 27-3), there is no secondary current flow. 
There is a primary current flow because the trans-
former is connected across a voltage source. The 
amount of primary current depends on the size of 
the primary windings. The primary windings act like 
an inductor. Exciting current is the small amount of 
primary current that flows. The exciting current over-
comes the AC resistance of the primary winding and 
supports the magnetic field of the core. Because of 
 inductive reactance, the exciting current lags behind 
the applied voltage. These conditions change when a 
load is applied across the secondary.
