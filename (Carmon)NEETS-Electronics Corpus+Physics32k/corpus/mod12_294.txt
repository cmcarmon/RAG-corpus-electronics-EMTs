Recall that a multivibrator output consists of the fundamental frequency and all of its harmonics.
Unwanted even harmonics are eliminated by using a SYMMETRICAL MULTIVIBRATOR circuit, as
shown in figure 2-13. The desired fundamental frequency, or desired odd harmonics, can be amplified
after all other odd harmonics are eliminated in the LCR filter section of figure 2-13. A single frequency-
modulated carrier is then made available for further amplification and transmission.
