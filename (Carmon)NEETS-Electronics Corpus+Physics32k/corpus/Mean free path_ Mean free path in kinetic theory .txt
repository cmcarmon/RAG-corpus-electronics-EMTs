In kinetic theory the mean free path of a particle, such as a molecule, is the average distance the particle travels between collisions with other moving particles. The formula



ℓ

{\displaystyle \ell =(n\sigma )^{-1}}
still holds for a particle with a high velocity relative to the velocities of an ensemble of identical particles with random locations. If, on the other hand, the velocities of the identical particles have a Maxwell distribution, the following relationship applies:

In practice, the diameter of gas molecules is not well defined. In fact, the kinetic diameter of a molecule is defined in terms of the mean free path. Typically, gas molecules do not behave like hard spheres, but rather attract each other at larger distances and repel each other at shorter distances, as can be described with a Lennard-Jones potential. One way to deal with such "soft" molecules is to use the Lennard-Jones σ parameter as the diameter. Another way is to assume a hard-sphere gas that has the same viscosity as the actual gas being considered. This leads to a mean free path

{\displaystyle \ell ={\frac {\mu }{p}}{\sqrt {\frac {\pi k_{\text{B}}T}{2m}}},}

where m is the molecular mass, and μ is the viscosity.
These different definitions of the molecular diameter can lead to slightly different values of the mean free path.
