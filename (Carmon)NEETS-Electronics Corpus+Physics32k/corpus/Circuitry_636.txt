achieve  the  same  effect  in  our  aerial  system  we 
need  to  place  a  conducting  element  about  one 
quarter of a wavelength behind the dipole element. 
This element is referred to as a reflector and it is 
said  to  be  ‘parasitic’  (i.e.  it  is  not  actually 
connected to the feeder). The reflector needs to be 
cut  slightly  longer than the driven dipole element. 
The resulting directional pattern will now only have 
one major lobe because the energy radiated will be 
concentrated into just one half of the figure-of-eight 
pattern that we started with.
