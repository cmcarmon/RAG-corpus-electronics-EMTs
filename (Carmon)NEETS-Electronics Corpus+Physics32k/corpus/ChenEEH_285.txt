Pink noise sources consist of ﬂicker (also called 1=f ) noise
and popcorn noise. Flicker noise pertains to the conductive
properties of an electronic element. Other theories attribute
ﬂicker noise to interface traps present at oxide-semiconductor
interfaces or to ﬂuctuations in mobility. The noise is a function
of the material homogeneity, its volume, the current, and
the frequency. Popcorn noise, on the other hand, is propor-
tional to 1=f 2 and is an indication of poor semiconductor
manufacturing. It is associated with distinct recombination
processes and appears as a series of low-frequency noise bursts.
Because it is uncommon, popcorn noise is not discussed fur-
ther.
