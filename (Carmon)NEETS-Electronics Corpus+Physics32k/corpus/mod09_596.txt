View (A) of figure 4-25 compares a square wave with sine waves. Sine wave K is the same 
frequency as the square wave (its fundamental frequency). If another sine wave (L) of smaller amplitude 
but three times the frequency (referred to as the third harmonic) is added to sine wave K, curve M is 
produced. The addition of these two waveforms is accomplished by adding the instantaneous values of 
both sine waves algebraically. Curve M is called the resultant. Notice that curve M begins to assume the 
shape of a square wave. Curve M is shown again in view (B).
