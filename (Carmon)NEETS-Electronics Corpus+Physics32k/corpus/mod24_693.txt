The RELEVANT OPTICAL POWER is the amount of optical power coupled into the fiber. It
depends on the angle over which the light is emitted, the size of the source's light-emitting area relative to
the fiber core size, the alignment of the source and fiber, and the coupling characteristics of the fiber
(such as the NA and the refractive index profile).
