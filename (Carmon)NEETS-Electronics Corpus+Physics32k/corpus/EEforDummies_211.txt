If your circuit is powered by a battery, you need to be aware of just how long 
your battery can supply the necessary current to your circuit. As I discuss in 
Chapter 12, batteries have ratings of amp‐hours. A battery with a rating of one 
amp‐hour (for example) will last for just one hour in a circuit that draws one 
amp of current — theoretically, anyway. (In practice, even new batteries don’t 
always deliver on their amp‐hour promises.) Therefore, when you’re deciding 
what power source to use for a circuit, you must take into account both the 
current that a circuit draws and how long you want to run the circuit.
