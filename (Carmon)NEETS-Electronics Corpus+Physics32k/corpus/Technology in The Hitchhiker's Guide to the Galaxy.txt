The Phargilor (or Penargilon) Kangaroo Relocation Drive appeared in Fit the Sixth of the radio seriesâ€”it can also be heard on BBC Sound Effects No. 26: Sci-Fi Sound Effects. The drive allows, in an emergency, a ship to be ejected suddenly through the fabric of space time and come to rest far from the starting point, with the pilot rarely having time to plot where the ship will end up. Ford and Arthur use this drive to escape from the Haggunenons.
