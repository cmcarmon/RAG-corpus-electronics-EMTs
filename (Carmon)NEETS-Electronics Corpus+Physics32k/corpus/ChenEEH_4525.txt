documented in Table 6.2. The ﬁnal discrete-time state-space
realization has eight states as predicted by the analytical mod-
eling. The magnitude and phase plots of its transfer functions
are compared to the experimental FRF data in Figures 6.6
and 6.7. All the input output channels are identiﬁed accurately
except for the (5,2) element, which corresponds to the ground
acceleration input and the displacement output of the AMD.
The poor ﬁtting there is caused by the extremely low signal-to-
noise ratio.
