The same formula will work for determining current in that circuit, too. Since we know
that a discharged capacitor initially acts like a short-circuit, the starting current will be the
maximum amount possible: 15 volts (from the battery) divided by 10 kâ„¦ (the only opposition
to current in the circuit at the beginning):
