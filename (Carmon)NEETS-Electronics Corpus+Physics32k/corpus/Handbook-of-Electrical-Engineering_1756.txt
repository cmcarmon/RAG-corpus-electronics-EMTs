Video signal processing is the area of specialization concerned with the processing of time sequences of image
data, i.e., video. Because of the signiﬁcant advances in computing power and increases in available transmission
bandwidth,  there  has  been  a  proliferation  of  potential  applications  in  the  area  of  video  signal  processing.
Applications  such  as  high-deﬁnition  television,  digital  video,  multimedia,  video  phone,  interactive  video,
medical  imaging,  and  information  processing  are  the  driving  forces  in  the  ﬁeld  today.  As  diverse  as  the
applications may seem, it is possible to specify a set of fundamental principles and methods that can be used
to develop the applications.
