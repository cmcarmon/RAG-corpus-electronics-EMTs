The switching waveforms of an IGBT in the clamped inductive
circuit are shown in Figure 7.18. The turn-on waveforms are
similar to those of the MOSFET in Figure 7.13. Two distinct
phases are observed while the IGBT turns on. The ﬁrst is the
rapid reduction in voltage as the capacitor CD discharges,
similar to a MOSFET. A ﬁnite time is required for high-level
injection conditions to set in the drift region. The gate voltage
starts rising again only after the transistor comes out of its
saturation region into the linear region.
