The  attribute  set  CT is  a  closed  subspace  and  therefore  possesses  a  prerequisite  property  needed  for  signal
restoration. On the other hand, attribute set C(q) is not convex, which seemingly precludes us from using the
sequence  of  successive  projections  algorithm  for  signal  restoration.  Theorem  8,  however,  indicates  that  the
associated  rank-q  operator  P(q)  is  closed.  We  may  therefore  employ  the  sequence  of  successive  projections
algorithm to effect the desired signal restoration. This algorithm takes the form
