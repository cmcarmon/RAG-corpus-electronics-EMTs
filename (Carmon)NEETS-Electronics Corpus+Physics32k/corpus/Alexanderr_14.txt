1. The  coulomb  is  a  large  unit  for  charges.  In  1  C  of  charge,  there
are 
electrons. Thus  realistic  or
laboratory values of charges are on the order of pC, nC, or  C.1
2. According  to  experimental  observations,  the  only  charges  that
occur  in  nature  are  integral  multiples  of  the  electronic  charge
