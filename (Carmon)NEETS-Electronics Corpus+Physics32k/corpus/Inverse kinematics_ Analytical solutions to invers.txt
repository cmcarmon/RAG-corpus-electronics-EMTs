An analytic solution to an inverse kinematics problem is a closed-form expression that takes the end-effector pose as input and gives joint positions as output,



q
=
f
(
x
)


{\displaystyle q=f(x)}
. Analytical inverse kinematics solvers can be significantly faster than numerical solvers and provide more than one solution for a given end-effector pose.
The IKFast open-source program can solve for the complete analytical solutions of most common robot manipulators and generate C++ code for them. The generated solvers cover most degenerate cases and can finish in microseconds on recent computers.
