FIGURE 6.3 Vector ^rr is Shown in Two Coordinate Systems: the Original Coordinate System (u, f) and a Rotated Coordinate System (u0, f0
).
The locus of the unit vector ^rr(t ) is in general an ellipse, with its major axis aligned along ^uu0, which is in general tilted by an angle g with respect
to the original axis ^uu.
