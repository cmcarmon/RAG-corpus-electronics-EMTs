ANTENNA HEIGHT AND SPEED.â€”Another factor affecting radar range is antenna height. The
high-frequency energy transmitted by a radar system travels in a straight line and does not normally bend
to conform to the curvature of the earth. Because of this, the height of both the antenna and the target are
factors in detection range. The distance to the horizon (in nautical miles) for a radar system varies with
the height of the antenna according to the following formula:
