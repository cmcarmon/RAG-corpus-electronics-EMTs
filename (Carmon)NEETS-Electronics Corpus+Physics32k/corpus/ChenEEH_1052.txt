Path Equalization: Lower Vdd
Between two consecutive registers, one can identify a number
of paths, the most important of which is the critical path. The
critical path is characterized by the fact that it takes the most
time, with respect to the other paths, to traverse between these
registers. The other paths will be faster, and one can lower the
supply voltage for these fast paths until their delay becomes
similar to the critical path, such as in Figure 5.18.
