Frequency response of most permanent magnet speakers falls off at the higher audio frequencies.
This problem is normally overcome either by the use of an expensive, specially designed speaker, or
through the use of two speakers, one of which is designed to operate well at the higher audio frequencies
(tweeter) and one at the lower frequencies (woofer).
