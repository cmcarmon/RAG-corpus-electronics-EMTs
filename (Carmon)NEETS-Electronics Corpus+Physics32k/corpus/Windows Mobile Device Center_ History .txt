Windows Mobile Device Center was written as a successor to the ActiveSync program that was previously used to synchronize Windows CE based devices with Windows operating systems prior to Windows Vista. The first public release was available in October 2006 as a beta version meant for use with Windows Vista RC1. In February 2007, the first official release was made available for download, and in June 2007, Windows Mobile Device Center was updated to work with the Windows Mobile 6 operating system. With the release of Windows Mobile Device Center, Pocket PC 2000 and Pocket PC 2002 operating systems were effectively phased out of full native support with Windows Vista. However, basic connectivity became available for these devices with the 6.1 version release.
Other versions of Windows, such as Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2 can also be WMDC enabled.
