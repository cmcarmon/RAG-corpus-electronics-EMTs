"Soft X-ray transients" are composed of some type of compact object (probably a neutron star) and some type of "normal", low mass star (i.e. a star with a mass of some fraction of the Sun's mass). These objects show changing levels of low-energy, or "soft", X-ray emission, probably produced somehow by variable transfer of mass from the normal star to the compact object. In effect the compact object "gobbles up" the normal star, and the X-ray emission can provide the best view of how this process occurs.
Soft X-ray transients Cen X-4 and Apl X-1 were discovered by Hakucho, Japan's first X-ray astronomy satellite.
