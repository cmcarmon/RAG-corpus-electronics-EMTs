Force and Co., and his father had been prosperous in the manufacturing industry. In 1889, Force had married Katherine Talmage, who was the granddaughter of former Brooklyn mayor Thomas Talmage. The Forces were part of Brooklyn high society, while William Force was a member of numerous prestigious clubs in the city. He also owned a notable art collection. Like the Astor family, the Forces were members of the Episcopal Church.
