As you have seen, positive feedback is accomplished by adding part of the output signal in phase 
with the input signal. In a common-base transistor amplifier, it is fairly simple to provide positive 
feedback. Since the input and output signals are in phase, you need only couple part of the output signal 
back to the input. This is shown in figure 1-18.
