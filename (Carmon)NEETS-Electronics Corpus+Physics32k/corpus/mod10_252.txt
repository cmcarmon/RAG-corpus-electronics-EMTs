The radiated energy from an antenna is in the form of an expanding sphere. Any small section of this 
sphere is perpendicular to the direction the energy travels and is called a WAVEFRONT. All energy on a 
wavefront is in phase. Usually all points on the wavefront are at equal distances from the antenna. The 
farther the wavefront is from the antenna, the less spherical the wave appears. At a considerable distance 
the wavefront can be considered as a plane surface at a right angle to the direction of propagation.
