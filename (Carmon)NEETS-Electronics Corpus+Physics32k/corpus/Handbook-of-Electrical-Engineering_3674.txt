Hard and easy directions in crystalline materials come about as a result of spin-orbit coupling. The spin, as
usual, determines the occurrence of ferro- or ferrimagnetization, while the orbital motion of the electrons (3d
in the case of Fe, Co, and Ni) responds to the structure of the crystal lattice.
