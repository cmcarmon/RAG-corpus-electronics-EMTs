Logic-level power minimization is relatively well studied
and understood. Unfortunately, due to the local nature of
most logic-level optimizations, a large number of transfor-
mations have to be applied to achieve sizable power savings.
This is a time-consuming and uncertain process during which
uncertainty is caused by the limited accuracy of power estima-
tion. In many cases, the savings produced by a local move are
below the ‘‘noise ﬂoor’’ of the power estimation engine. As a
consequence, logic-level optimization does not result in mas-
sive power reductions. Savings are in the 10 to 20% range, on
average.
