HESPER  (HEterostructure  device  Simulation  Program  to  Estimate  the  performance  Rigorously)  is  a  two-
dimensional device simulator that can be used to simulate heterostructure photodiodes, HBTs, and HEMTs.
The simulation starts with the solution of Poisson’s equation in which the electron and hole concentrations
are described as functions of the composition (composition dependent). The recombination rate is given by
the Shockley–Read–Hall relationship. Lifetimes of both types of carriers are assumed to be equal in this model.
PISCES-2B  is  a  two-dimensional  device  simulator  for  simulation  of  diodes,  BJTs,  MOSFETs,  JFETs,  and
