The housings or weathersheds of composite insulators are
made by organic materials, mainly hydrocarbons. Organic
materials, in comparison with inorganic porcelain and glass,
have weaker electrostatic bonds that can be broken more easily.
Therefore, composite insulators are more easily prone to de-
terioration by heat from electrical discharge activity, chemicals
(including water), and natural elements like sunlight, humid-
ity, and temperature. Hence, composite insulators can undergo
a reduction in the electrical and mechanical properties with
time, and these changes are irreversible.
