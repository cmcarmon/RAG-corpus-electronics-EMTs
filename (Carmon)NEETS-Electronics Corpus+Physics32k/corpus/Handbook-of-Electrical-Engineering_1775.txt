Vector Quantization
Quantization does not have to be done on a single pixel at a time. In fact, better results can be achieved if the
video data are quantized on a vector (block) basis. In vector quantization, the image data are ﬁrst processed
into a set of vectors. A code book (set of code words or templates) that best matches the data to be quantized
is then generated. Each input vector is then quantized to the closest code word. Compression is achieved by
transmitting  only  the  indices  for  the  code  words. At  the  receiver,  the  images  are  reconstructed  using  a  table
look-up  procedure.  Two  areas  of  ongoing  research  are  ﬁnding  better  methods  for  designing  the  code  books
and developing better search and update techniques for matching the input vectors to the code words.
