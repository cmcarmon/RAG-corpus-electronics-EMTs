Employment  discrimination  occurs  when  an 
 employer treats an applicant or worker unfairly with 
one or more of the protected characteristics of Title 
VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Anyone who expe-
riences discrimination at work or is retaliated against 
for exercising his or her employment rights can seek 
legal protection.
