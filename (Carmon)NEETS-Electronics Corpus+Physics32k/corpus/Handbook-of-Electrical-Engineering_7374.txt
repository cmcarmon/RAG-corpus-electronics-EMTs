One of the limitations to accuracy and to repeatability in telemetry is the output level of the transducer. The
low  electrical  levels  produced  by  thermocouples  and  strain  gauges  (millivolts)  are  much  more  difﬁcult  to
telemeter than a higher-voltage level of, say, 5 V. At low signal levels, extraneous electrical noises produce great
degradation.  This  noise  may  be  thermally  generated,  caused  by  atmospheric  effects,  or  generated  by  nearby
electrical  equipment.  When  low-level  transducers  are  used,  stable  ampliﬁers  are  required  to  raise  the  signal
voltage to useful modulation levels.
