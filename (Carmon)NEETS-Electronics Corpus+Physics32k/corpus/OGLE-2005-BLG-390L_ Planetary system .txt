OGLE-2005-BLG-390L has one known planet, which was discovered using the technique of gravitational microlensing. Indications are that the planet is about five times Earth mass, orbiting at about 2.6 astronomical units from the parent star. The discovery was announced on January 25, 2006. OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb is considered one of the smallest known extrasolar planets around a main sequence star, possibly rocky, with a mass around 5.5 times that of the Earth. The orbital radius (assuming a circular orbit) of the planet is 2.6 AU, however the orbital elements are unknown. Based on its low mass and estimated temperature of around 50 K, the planet is thought to consist mainly of ices, like Pluto or Uranus, rather than being a Jupiter-like gas giant.
