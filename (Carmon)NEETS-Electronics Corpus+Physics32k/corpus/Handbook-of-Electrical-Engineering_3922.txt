As a result of the symmetry of the transmission line resonator, the voltage along the transmission line will
have maxima at the ends and a null at the center of the line. This implies that the input impedance will be
maximum when the feed point is at the edge of the patch, and will decrease to zero as the feed is moved to the
center of the patch. Fig. 38.16 shows a Smith chart plot of the input impedance of a coaxial probe-fed microstrip
antenna vs. frequency, for three different probe positions. Observe that the input impedance locus decreases
as the feed point moves toward the center of the patch. Also, observe that the impedance locus becomes more
inductive as the feed point moves toward the center of the patch.
