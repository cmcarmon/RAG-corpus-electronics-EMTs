Geometrical-Optics Model
Geometrical optics and the geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD) are high-frequency asymptotic techniques
wherein  the  ﬁelds  are  propagated  using  such  optical  concepts  as  shadowing,  ray  tubes,  and  refraction  and
diffraction. Although conceptually straightforward, optical techniques are limited analytically by the unavail-
ability of diffraction coefﬁcients for various geometries and material bodies and numerically by the need to
trace rays over complex surfaces. There is a vast literature on geometrical optics and GTD, as may be ascertained
by examining the yearly and cumulative indexes of such publications as the Transactions of the IEEE Antennas
and Propagation Society.
