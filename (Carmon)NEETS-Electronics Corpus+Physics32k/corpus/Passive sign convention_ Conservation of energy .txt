One advantage of defining all the variables in a circuit to comply with the PSC is that it makes it easy to express conservation of energy. Since electric energy cannot be created or destroyed, at any given instant every watt of power consumed by a load component must be produced by some source component in the circuit. Therefore the sum of all the power consumed by loads equals the sum of all the power produced by sources. Since with the PSC the power dissipation in sources is negative and power dissipation in loads is positive, the sum of all the power dissipation in all the components in a circuit is always zero
