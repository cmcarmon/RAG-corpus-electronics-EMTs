In  lead  network  compensation  we  actually  insert  phase  lead  in  the  vicinity  of  the  crossover  frequency  to
increase the PM. Thus we realize a speciÔ¨Åed PM without lowering the medium-frequency system gain. We see
that the disadvantages of the lag network are the advantages of the lead network and the advantages of the lag
network are the disadvantages of the lead network.
