The addition of R1 and R2 into the meter circuit raises the total series resistance and decreases the
current. This decreases the amount of pointer deflection. The pointer comes to rest at a scale reading that
indicates the combined resistance of R1 and R2. If you were to replace either R1 or R2, or both, with a
resistor having a larger ohmic value, the current flow in the moving coil of the meter would be decreased
even more. This would further decrease the pointer deflection, and the scale indication would read a still
higher circuit resistance. View B is a simplified version of the circuitry in view A.
