Digital  modulation  theory  and  low-pass  equivalent  circuits  of  bandpass  communications  systems  are
described at an introductory level in [1]. The theory of spread spectrum communications can be found in [10].
The ﬁeld of communicating with chaos has developed rapidly since the experiments by Pecora, Carroll, and
others in the 1990s on chaotic synchronization [11]. Hasler [12] has written an overview of early work in this
ﬁeld.
