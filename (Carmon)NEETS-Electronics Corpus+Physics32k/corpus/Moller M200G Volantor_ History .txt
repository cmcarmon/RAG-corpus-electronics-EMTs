Paul Moller, the vehicle's inventor, has been working to bring a flying vehicle to the mass market for over five decades without success.
News reports have been skeptical that the M200G vehicle will come to market, citing a case by the Securities and Exchange Commission which noted that in 1997 promotional materials for the Skycar had predicted 10,000 units sold by 2002.
Moller and his team claim that over 200 test flights of the M200G Neuera have already been conducted, though these flights rely on ground effect and do not necessarily suggest significant movement toward the goals set forth for the flagship model, the Skycar M400. Moller had predicted they would have the M200G ready for sale by early 2008 with a goal of 250 units produced in the year, but this did not occur. Depending upon demand, the M200G could cost under US$100,000 according to the company. As of August 2007, Moller had not yet established if the vehicle will be regulated by the United States Federal Aviation Administration or the Department of Transportation. Moller International has a long record of making promises which are not fulfilled, which tends to generate skepticism about their claims.
