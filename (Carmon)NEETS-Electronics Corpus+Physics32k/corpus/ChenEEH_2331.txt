Appendix A: References
The technical literature on transmission lines is pervasive with
several articles scattered in books and journals, ranging from
introductory material to advanced topics and covering both
theoretical and practical aspects. The basic background mate-
rial
introduced in this chapter can be supplemented with
further reading from the references listed below that are ar-
ranged by topics. A few books are devoted exclusively to
transmission lines. Transmission line theory, however,
is
covered exhaustively in several electromagnetics textbooks.
The list is not intended to be exhaustive.
