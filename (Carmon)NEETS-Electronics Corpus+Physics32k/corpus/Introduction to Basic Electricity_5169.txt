A low-wattage soldering iron tends to cool faster during  
the soldering process than a high-wattage soldering 
iron. The handle of the soldering iron should be com-
fortable to hold and should be well insulated to pre-
vent heat buildup. Soldering irons can produce static 
voltage spikes that will destroy many integrated circuit 
components. A grounded soldering iron tip is a good 
safety measure. Figure 49-11 shows several types of 
soldering irons suitable for printed circuit boards. The 
least expensive is the pencil soldering iron, and with 
proper care it will last many years. The temperature-
controlled soldering station provides precise tip 
temperature through a closed loop circuit and main-
tains a constant tip temperature throughout the sol-
dering process. The cordless soldering iron is similar
