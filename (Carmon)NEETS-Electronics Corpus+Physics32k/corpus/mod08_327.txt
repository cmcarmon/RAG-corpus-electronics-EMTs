Now you see how a differential amplifier can produce two amplified, differential output signals from
a single-input signal. One further point of interest about this configuration is that if a combined output
signal is taken between outputs number one and two, this single output will be twice the amplitude of the
individual outputs. In other words, you can double the gain of the differential amplifier (single output) by
taking the output signal between the two output terminals. This single-output signal will be in phase with
the input signal. This is shown by the phantom signal above R5 (the phantom resistor connected between
outputs number one and two would be used to develop this signal).
