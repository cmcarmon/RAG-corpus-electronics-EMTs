Liquid cooling systems also include pressure gauges and switches, temperature gauges, and 
overtemperature switches. Many systems have pressure or flow regulators. Some systems include audio 
and/or visual alarms that energize before damage actually occurs. In some cases this allows the problem 
to be corrected without turning off the equipment.
