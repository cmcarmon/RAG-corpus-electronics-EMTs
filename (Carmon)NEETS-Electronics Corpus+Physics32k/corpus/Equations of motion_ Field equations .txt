Equations that describe the spatial dependence and time evolution of fields are called field equations. These include
Maxwell's equations for the electromagnetic field,
Poisson's equation for Newtonian gravitational or electrostatic field potentials,
the Einstein field equation for gravitation (Newton's law of gravity is a special case for weak gravitational fields and low velocities of particles).
This terminology is not universal: for example although the Navierâ€“Stokes equations govern the velocity field of a fluid, they are not usually called "field equations", since in this context they represent the momentum of the fluid and are called the "momentum equations" instead.
