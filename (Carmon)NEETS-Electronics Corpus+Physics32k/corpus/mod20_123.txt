CONTROL DIFFERENTIAL TRANSMITTER (CDX)A type of synchro that transmits angular 
information equal to the algebraic sum or difference of the electrical input supplied to its stator, the 
mechanical input supplied to its stator, and the mechanical input supplied to its rotor. The output is an 
electrical voltage taken from the rotor windings [15].
