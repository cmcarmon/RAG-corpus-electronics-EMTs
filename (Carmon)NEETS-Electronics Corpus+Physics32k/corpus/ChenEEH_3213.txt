More important substations are designed so that the failure of
a piece of equipment in the substation or one of the subtrans-
mission lines to the substation will not cause an interruption
of power to the consumer. The location of a substation is
dictated by the voltage levels, voltage regulation consider-
ations, subtransmission costs, substation costs, and the pri-
mary feeders, mains, and distribution transformers. Location
is also restricted by esthetic considerations.
