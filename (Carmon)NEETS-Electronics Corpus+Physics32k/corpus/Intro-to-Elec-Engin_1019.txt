The sinusoidal ﬂux-density distribution given by Equation (12.3.9) can be represented by a
vector Bm cos ωt of pulsating magnitude on the axis of the coil, as shown in Figure 12.3.3(a).
Alternatively, as suggested by Equation (12.3.10), this stationary pulsating ﬂux-density vector can
be represented by two counterrotating vectors of constant magnitude Bm/2, as shown in Figure
12.3.3(b). While Equation (12.3.9) represents a standing space wave varying sinusoidally with
time, Equation (12.3.10) represents the two rotating components of constant and equal magnitude,
