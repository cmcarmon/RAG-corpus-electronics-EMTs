You should remember that capacitance opposes a change in voltage. This is shown by comparing graph
(A) to graph (D). In graph (A) the voltage changed instantly from 0 volts to 6 volts across the circuit, while
the voltage developed across the capacitor in graph (D) took the entire time interval from time to to time t1 to
reach 6 volts. The reason for this is that in the first instant at time t0, maximum current flows through R and
the entire circuit voltage is dropped across the resistor. The voltage impressed across the capacitor at t0 is
zero volts.  As time progresses toward t
