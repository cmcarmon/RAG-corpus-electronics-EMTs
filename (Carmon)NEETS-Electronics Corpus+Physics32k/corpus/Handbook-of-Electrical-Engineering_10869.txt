MATLAB itself underwent further development. It was rewritten in C for efﬁciency and enhanced portability
and released as a commercial product in 1985. Like its competitors, the main market was initially the CACSD
market, where, supported by two sets of toolbox extensions called the Control and Signal Processing Toolboxes,
MATLAB  made  rapid  inroads  into  academia  and  industry. A  recent  development  has  been  the  provision  of
add-on  graphical  input  of  system  models,  in  the  form  of  block  diagrams,  support  for  “point-and-click”
nonlinear simulation, and enhanced graphical functionality. At least one package, MATRIXx, has evolved further
by the addition of data structures and more sophisticated support for macro development. The result is the
package X-Math described by Floyd et al. [1991].
