The spectrum of thermal noise power is uniformly spread over frequency up to the infrared region
around 1012 Hz, as shown in Figure 14.3.5(b). Such a distribution indicates that n(t) contains all
electrical frequencies in equal proportion, and an equal number of electrons is vibrating at every
frequency. By analogy to white light, which contains all visible frequencies in equal proportion,
thermal noise is also referred to as white noise.
