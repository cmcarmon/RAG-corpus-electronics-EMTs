The linear wave equation models the displacement u of an idealized dispersionless one-dimensional string, in terms of derivatives with respect to time t and space x:

)
.


{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial ^{2}u}{\partial t^{2}}}-c^{2}{\frac {\partial ^{2}u}{\partial x^{2}}}=f(x,t).}

The function f(x,t), in natural units, represents an external force applied to string at the position (x,t). In order to be a suitable physical model for nature, it should be possible to solve it for any initial state that the string is in, specified by its initial displacement and velocity:




u

x

(
x
)
.


{\displaystyle u(x,0)=u_{0}(x),\qquad {\frac {\partial u}{\partial t}}(x,0)=v_{0}(x).}

More generally, we should be able to solve the equation with data specified on any t = constant slice:




u
(
x
,
T
)
=

u

(

)
.


{\displaystyle u(x,T)=u_{T}(x),\qquad {\frac {\partial u}{\partial t}}(x,T)=v_{T}(x).}

To evolve a solution from any given time slice T to T+dT, the contribution of the force must be added to the solution. That contribution comes from changing the velocity of the string by f(x,T)dT. That is, to get the solution at time T+dT from the solution at time T, we must add to it a new (forward) solution of the homogeneous (no external forces) wave equation

{\displaystyle U(x,T)=0,\qquad {\frac {\partial U}{\partial t}}(x,T)=f(x,T)dT.}

A solution to this equation is achieved by straightforward integration:

(The expression in parenthesis is just

{\displaystyle P^{T}f(x,t)}
in the notation of the general method above.) So a solution of the original initial value problem is obtained by starting with a solution to the problem with the same prescribed initial values problem but with zero external force, and adding to that (integrating) the contributions from the added force in the time intervals from T to T+dT:
