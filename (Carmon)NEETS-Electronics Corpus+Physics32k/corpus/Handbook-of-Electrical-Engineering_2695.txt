Hierarchical tools that produce nonsliceable ﬂoorplans have also been proposed
[Sarrafzadeh  and  Wong,  1996].  The  major  problem  in  the  development  of  such
tools is that we are often facing problems that are intractable and thus we have to
rely  on  heuristics  in  order  to  obtain  fast  solutions.  For  example,  the  cell  sizing
problem can be tackled optimally in sliceable ﬂoorplans [Otten, 1983 and Stock-
meyer, 1983] but the problem is intractable for general nonsliceable ﬂoorplans.
