However, since the MOSFET gate is insulated from the channel, positive gate-source
voltages may also be applied without losing the FET eï¬€ect. Depending on the construction
details, the application of a positive gate-source voltage to a depletion-type MOSFET can
repel the minority positive carriers in the depleted portion of the N-channel back into the P-
type material as discussed below, thereby enlarging the channel and reducing the resistance.
If the device exhibits this behaviour, it is known as an enhancement-depletion MOSFET.
