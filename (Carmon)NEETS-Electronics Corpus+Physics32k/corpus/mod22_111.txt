Never bend, fold, or otherwise distort the shape of a disk. Never place heavy objects such as books 
on top of disks. Store disks in the box they came in, or in filing containers that are specifically designed 
for storing disks. Try to store disks vertically, but if you do store disks horizontally, do not stack more 
than 10 disks.
