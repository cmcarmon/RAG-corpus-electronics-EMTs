Figure 2-7 will help you understand the differences between delay, standard, and fast fuses. Figure
2-7 shows that, if a 1-ampere rated fuse had 2 amperes of current through it, (200% of the rated value), a
fast fuse would open in about .7 second, a standard rated fuse would open in about 1.5 seconds, and a
delay rated fuse would open in about 10 seconds. Notice that in each of the fuses, the time required to
open the fuse decreases as the rated current increases.
