Parabolic-dish  electric-transport  technology  for  DG  was  under  active  development  at  the  Jet  Propulsion
Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, in the late ’70s and early ’80s. Prototype modules with Stirling engines
reached a record 29% overall efﬁciency of conversion from insolation to electrical output. Earlier parabolic-
dish  designs  collected  and  transported  thermal  energy  to  a  central  location  for  conversion  to  electricity.
Advanced designs such as the one developed at JPL employed engine driven generators at the focal points of
the dishes, and energy was collected and transported in electrical form.
