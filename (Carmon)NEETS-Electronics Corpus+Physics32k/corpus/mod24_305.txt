A stranded cable is a fiber optic cable consisting of buffered fibers stranded down the center of the
cable surrounded by strength members and a protective jacket. Figure 3-16 shows a cross-sectional view
of the stranded cable. The fiber is typically buffered with a polyester elastomer to a total diameter of 900
m m. The recommended use of stranded cables is in medium-density (24 to 72 fibers) Navy applications.
However, this recommendation is preliminary. Further test and evaluation of prototype stranded cable
designs is continuing. Final approval of the stranded cable will occur only after prototype cables have
passed all tests.
