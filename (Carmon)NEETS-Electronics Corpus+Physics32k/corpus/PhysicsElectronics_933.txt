The information ﬂow on the computer bus is time-multiplexed to allow diﬀerent functional
units to use the same bus lines at diﬀerent times. We will assume that only one device tries
to write (drive) a given bus line at any time. A special unit, known as a bus master, has
the responsibility for controlling the other units, which are correspondingly known as the
bus slaves. If several units are capable of becoming bus masters these units must arbitrate
amongst themselves to determine which is to have control of the bus for a given interval of
time. Often a direct memory access (DMA) unit is allowed to communicate with a slave
memory without going through the CPU bus master. This allows memory access at a higher
speed than having to go through the intermediate CPU bus master.
