The sum of 4, E, 1, and 3 in the first column is 1616. Write down the 6 and the carry. In the second
column, 1, 1, 9, and 7 equals 1216. Write the carry over the next column. Add B and 2 ¾ the sum is D.
Write this in the sum line. Now add the final column, 1, 1, 5, and C. The sum is 1316. Write down the
carry; then add 3 and B ¾ the sum is E. Write down the E and bring down the final carry to complete the
problem.
