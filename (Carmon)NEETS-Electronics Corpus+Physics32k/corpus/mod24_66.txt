Despite the many advantages of fiber optic systems, there are some disadvantages. Because of the
relative newness of the technology, fiber optic components are expensive. Fiber optic transmitters and
receivers are still relatively expensive compared to electrical interfaces. The lack of standardization in the
industry has also limited the acceptance of fiber optics. Many industries are more comfortable with the
use of electrical systems and are reluctant to switch to fiber optics. However, industry researchers are
eliminating these disadvantages.
