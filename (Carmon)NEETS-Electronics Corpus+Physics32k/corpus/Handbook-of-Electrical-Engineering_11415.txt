It  is  convenient  to  divide  semiconductor  detectors  into  two  groups:  those  requiring  cooling  (normally  to
77K)  and  those  capable  of  room  temperature  (or  near  room  temperature)  operation.  The  former  group  is
dominated by high-purity germanium (HPGe) and lithium drifted silicon (Si:Li) — a group characterized by
particularly high energy resolution. The latter group includes detectors based on cadmium telluride, cadmium
zinc telluride, and mercuric iodide, as well as a number of silicon-based devices. This group ﬁnds application
in portable X-ray and gamma-ray spectrometers and counters and imaging systems where the freedom from
the weight and maintenance of a cryogenic cooler is particularly valued. This chapter section is divided into
sections on cryogenic detectors and room-temperature devices. Details of the physics of semiconductor detectors
as well as their performance characteristics can be found in several texts [1–7].
