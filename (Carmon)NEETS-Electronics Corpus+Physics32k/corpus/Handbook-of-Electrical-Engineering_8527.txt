Now, imagine that multiple functional units are provided in the processor so that more than one instruction
can  be  in  the  operate  stage.  This  parallel  execution  capability,  when  added  to  pipelining  of  the  individual
instructions, means that execution rates of more than one instruction completion per basic step time can be
achieved. This mode of enhanced processor performance is called superscalar processing.
