The most general method for the solution of electrostatic
problems is to solve the partial differential equations (Poisson’s
or Laplace’s) as boundary value problems. Since Poisson’s
equation is the inhomogeneous version of Laplace’s equation,
the foundation of all solutions is the solution of Laplace’s
equation.
