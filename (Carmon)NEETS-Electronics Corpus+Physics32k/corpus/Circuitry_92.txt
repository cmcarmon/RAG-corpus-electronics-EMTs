  Typical  NTC  thermistors  have  resistances  that 
vary  from  a  few  hundred  (or  thousand)  ohms  at  
25°C  to  a  few  tens  (or  hundreds)  of  ohms  at  
100°C. PTC thermistors, on the other hand, usually 
have  a  resistance-temperature  characteristic  which 
remains  substantially  flat  (typically  at  around  
100 $) over the range 0°C to around 75°C. Above 
this,  and  at  a  critical  temperature  (usually  in  the 
range  80°C  to  120°C)  their  resistance  rises  very 
rapidly to values of up to, and beyond, 10 k$ (see 
Fig. 2.16). 
  A typical application of PTC thermistors is over-
current  protection.  Provided  the  current  passing 
through the thermistor remains below the threshold 
current,  the  effects  of  self-heating  will  remain 
negligible and the resistance of the thermistor will 
remain  low  (i.e.  approximately  the  same  as  the
