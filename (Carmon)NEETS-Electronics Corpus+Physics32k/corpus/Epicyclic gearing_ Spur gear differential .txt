A spur gear differential is constructed from two identical coaxial epicyclic gear trains assembled with a single carrier such that their planet gears are engaged. This forms a planetary gear train with a fixed carrier train ratio R = −1.
In this case, the fundamental formula for the planetary gear train yields,

Thus, the angular velocity of the carrier of a spur gear differential is the average of the angular velocities of the sun and ring gears.
In discussing the spur gear differential, the use of the term ring gear is a convenient way to distinguish the sun gears of the two epicyclic gear trains. The second sun gear serves the same purpose as the ring gear of a simple planetary gear train, but clearly does not have the internal gear mate that is typical of a ring gear.
