for that time period). Clearly, there was exploding interest
in MEMS components for ﬁber optic networks. Lucent
Technologies has been one of
the major developers of
MEMS mirror switches for optical networks. The company’s
technology is shown in Figure 6.15. Lucent and other com-
panies making switches to transfer optical signals from one
ﬁber to another are ﬁeld-testing programs. Major,
indeed
massive, usage of such switches might occur in the next few
years.
