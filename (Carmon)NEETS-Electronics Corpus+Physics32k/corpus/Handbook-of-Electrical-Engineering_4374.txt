Communications using light as a signal carrier and optical ﬁbers as transmission media are termed optical ﬁber
communications.  The  applications  of  optical  ﬁber  communications  have  increased  at  a  rapid  rate,  since  the
ﬁrst commercial installation of a ﬁber-optic system in 1977. Today every major telecommunication company
is  spending  millions  of  dollars  on  optical  ﬁber  communication  systems.  In  an  optical  ﬁber  communication
system voice, video, or data are converted to a coded pulse stream of light using a suitable light source. This
pulse stream is carried by optical ﬁbers to a regenerating or receiving station. At the ﬁnal receiving station the
light pulses are converted to electric signals, decoded, and converted into the form of the original information.
Optical  ﬁber  communications  arc  currently  used  for  telecommunications,  data  communications,  military
applications, industrial controls, medical applications, and CATV.
