Perhaps the most familiar example of “a new generation of environmental management” requirements which
”.  These  programs,  such  as  the  one
will  have  enormous  effects  on  electronics  design  is “
mentioned  in  the  Blue  Angel  labeling  scheme,  are  being  introduced  in  Germany  and  other  countries  for
electronics  manufacturers.  They  generally  require  that  the  ﬁrm  take  its  products  back  once  the  consumer  is

such  “take  back”  requirements.  Similarly,  the  emergence  of  the  international  standard,

environmental product speciﬁcations will have vast implications for the electronics industry. Though technically
voluntary,  in  practice  these  standards  in  fact  become  requirements  for  ﬁrms  wishing  to  engage  in  global
