Today, when studying light that consists of many photons, as in propagation, that light behaves as a
continuumâ€”an electromagnetic wave. On the other hand, when studying the interaction of light with
semiconductors, as in sources and detectors, the quantum physics approach is taken. The wave versus
particle dilemma can be addressed in a more formal way, but that is beyond the scope of this text. It
suffices to say that much has been reconciled between the two using quantum physics. In this manual, we
use both the electromagnetic wave and photon concepts, each in the places where it best matches the
phenomenon we are studying.
