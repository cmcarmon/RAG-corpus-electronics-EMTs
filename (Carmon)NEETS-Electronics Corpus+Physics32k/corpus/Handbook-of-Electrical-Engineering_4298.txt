Altimeters
A very detailed discussion of FM/CW altimeters has been given by Saunders [1990, pp. 14.34 –14.36], in which
he has described modern commercial products built by Bendix and Collins. The parameters will be summarized
below and if more information is needed, the reader may want to turn to other references [Saunders, 1990;
Bendix  Corp.,  1982;  and  Maoz  et al.,  1991].  In  his  material,  Saunders  gives  a  general  overview  of  modern
altimeters, all of which use wide-deviation FM at a low modulation frequency. He discusses the limitations on
narrowing the antenna pattern, which must be wide enough to accommodate attitude changes of the aircraft.
Triangular  modulation  is  used,  since  for  this  waveform  the  Doppler  averages  out,  and  dual  antennas  are
employed. There may be a step error or quantization in height (which could be a problem at low altitudes),
due to the limitation of counting zero crossings. A difference of one zero crossing (i.e., 1/2 Hz) corresponds
to  3/4 meter  for  a  frequency  deviation  of  100  MHz.  Irregularities  are  not  often  seen,  however,  since  meter
response is slow. Also, if terrain is rough, there will be actual physical altitude ﬂuctuations. Table 41.9 shows
some  of  the  altimeters’  parameters.  These  altimeters  are  not  acceptable  for  military  aircraft,  because  their
relatively  wide-open  front  ends  make  them  potentially  vulnerable  to  electronic  countermeasures.  A  French
design has some advantages in this respect by using a variable frequency deviation, a difference frequency that
is essentially constant with altitude, and a narrowband front-end ampliﬁer [Saunders, 1990].
