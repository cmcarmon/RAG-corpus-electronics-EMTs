As we pointed out earlier, phase modulation cannot occur without an incidental change in frequency,
nor can frequency modulation occur without an incidental change in phase. The term fm is loosely used
when referring to any type of angle modulation, and phase modulation is sometimes incorrectly referred
to as "indirect fm." This is a definition that you should disregard to avoid confusion. Phase modulation is
just what the words imply â€” phase modulation of a carrier by an af modulating signal. You will develop
a better understanding of these points as you advance in your study of modulation.
