Piezoresistivity  is  a  linear  coupling  between  mechanical  stress 
. The piezoresistance properties of semiconducting silicon and
represented by a fourth rank polar tensor 
germanium were discovered by Smith [1953] when he was verifying the form of their energy surfaces. Piezore-
sistance measurements can provide valuable insights concerning the conduction mechanisms in solids such as
strain-induced carrier repopulation and intervalley scattering in multivalley semiconductors [Herring and Vogt,
 
1980] and barrier raising in semiconducting positive
1956], barrier tunneling in thick ﬁlm resistors [Canali et al.,
temperature coefﬁcient of resistivity (PTCR) perovskites [Amin, 1989]. Piezoresistivity has also been investi-
