Could a system of the Higgs field and some fermion field of the Standard model be in the state of Friedberg & Lee NTS ? That is more possible for a heavy fermion field: for a such one the energy gain would be the most because it does lose its large mass in the NTS interior, were the Yukawa term



g

Ψ


{\displaystyle g\sigma {\overline {\Psi }}\Psi }
vanishes due to

{\displaystyle \sigma \simeq 0}
. The more so if the vacuum energy in the NTS interior

. The large fermion mass implies strong Yukawa coupling

The next question is whether or not multi-fermion NTS like a fermion Q-star is stable in the Standard model. If we restrict ourself by one fermion species, then the NTS has god the gauge charge. One can estimate the energy of gauged NTS as follows:

{\displaystyle E=(4\pi )^{1/3}(3/4)^{5/3}Q^{4/3}/R+\beta e^{2}Q^{2}/R+(4\pi R^{3}/3)\lambda \sigma _{0}^{4}/4.}

Here



R


{\displaystyle R}
and



Q


{\displaystyle Q}
are its radius and charge, the first term is the kinetic energy of the fermi-gas, the second is the Coulomb energy,



β


{\displaystyle \beta }
takes into account the charge distribution inside the NTS and the latest one gives the volume vacuum energy. Minimization with



R


{\displaystyle R}
gives the NTS energy as a function of its charge:

{\displaystyle E(Q)=4\sigma _{0}(\pi \lambda )^{1/4}/3\left((4\pi )^{1/3}(3/4)^{5/3}Q^{4/3}+\beta e^{2}Q^{2}\right)^{3/4}.}

An NTS is stable if



E
(
Q
)


{\displaystyle E(Q)}
is smaller than the sum of masses for



Q


{\displaystyle Q}
particles at infinite distance each from other. That is case for some



Q


{\displaystyle Q}
, but such a



E

{\displaystyle E(Q)}
dependence allows the fission for any

Why could not quarks be bound in a hadron like in NTS. Friedberg and Lee investigated such a possibility. They assumed quarks getting huge masses from their interaction with a scalar field



σ


{\displaystyle \sigma }
. Thus free quarks are heavy and escape from detection. The NTS built with quarks and



σ


{\displaystyle \sigma }
fields demonstrate static properties of hadrons with 15% accuracy. That model demands SU(3) symmetry additional to the color one in order to preserve the later unbroken so that QCD gluons get large masses by SU(3) symmetry breaking outside hadrons and also avoid detection.
Nuclei have been considered as NTS's in the effective theory of strong interaction which is easier to deal with than QCD.
