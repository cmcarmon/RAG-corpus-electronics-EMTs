The motion of a ship at sea has the six degrees of freedom of a rigid body, and is described as:

Moving up and down (elevating/heaving);
Moving left and right (strafing/swaying);
Moving forward and backward (walking/surging);
Swivels left and right (yawing);
Tilts forward and backward (pitching);
Pivots side to side (rolling).

The trajectory of an airplane in flight has three degrees of freedom and its attitude along the trajectory has three degrees of freedom, for a total of six degrees of freedom.
