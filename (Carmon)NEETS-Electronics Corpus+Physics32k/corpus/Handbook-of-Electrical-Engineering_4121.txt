EN 55022 and IEC 1000 Series (Part 4)
EN  55022,  also  known  as  CISPR  Publication  22,  involves  the  limits  and  methods  of  measurement  of  radio
interference  characteristics  of  ITE.  Currently,  the  ITE  must  meet  three  Parts  (standards)  of  the  IEC  1000-4
series. However, the future revision of the IEC 1000-4 series may mandate an additional eight requirements
(presently int he process of review). Consult the latest versions of the applicable generic standard for the current
requirements.
