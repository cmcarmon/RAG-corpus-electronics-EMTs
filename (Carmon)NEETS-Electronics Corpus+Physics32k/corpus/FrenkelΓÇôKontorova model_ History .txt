A simple model of a harmonic chain in a periodic substrate potential was proposed by Ulrich Dehlinger in 1928. Dehlinger derived an approximate analytical expression for the stable solutions of this model which he termed Verhakungen which correspond to what is today called kink pairs. An essentially similar model was developed by Ludwig Prandtl in 1912/13 but did not see publication until 1928.
The model was independently proposed by Yakov Frenkel and Tatiana Kontorova in their 1938 paper On the theory of plastic deformation and twinning to describe the dynamics of a crystal lattice near a dislocation and to describe crystal twinning. In the standard linear harmonic chain any displacement of the atoms will result in waves and the only stable configuration will be the trivial one. For the nonlinear chain of Frenkel and Kontorova there exist stable configurations beside the trivial one. For small atomic displacements the situation resembles the linear chain, however for large enough displacements it is possible to create a moving single dislocation for which an analytical solution was derived by Frenkel and Kontorova. The shape of these dislocations is defined only by the parameters of the system such as the mass and the elastic constant of the springs.
Dislocations, also called solitons, are distributed non-local defects and mathematically they are a type of topological defect. The defining characteristic of solitons/dislocations is that they behave much like stable particles, they can move while maintaining their overall shape. Two solitons of equal and opposite orientation may cancel upon collision but a single soliton can not annihilate spontaneously.
