For any of the six standard robot conﬁgurations, the orientation capability of the major linkages is severely
limited. Thus, it is critical to provide additional joints, known as the minor linkages, to provide the capability
of varied orientations for a given position. Most robots include a three-DOF revolute joint wrist that is connected
to the last link of the major linkages. The three revolute axes will be orthogonal and will usually intersect in a
common  point,  known  as  the  wrist  center  point.  Then,  the  kinematic  equations  of  the  manipulator  can  be
partitioned into locating the Cartesian position of the wrist center point and then determining the orientation
of a Cartesian frame ﬁxed to the wrist axes.
