where Ra is the total internal armature resistance, including the resistance of interpole and
compensating windings as well as that of the brushes. The value of the generated emf Ea, by
Equation (13.4.3), is governed by the direct-axis ﬁeld ﬂux (which is a function of the ﬁeld current
and armature reaction) and the angular velocity ωm of the rotor.
