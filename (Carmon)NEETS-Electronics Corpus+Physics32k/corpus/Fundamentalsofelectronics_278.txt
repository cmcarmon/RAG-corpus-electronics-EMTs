Let’s try this analysis technique on a simple extension of the inverting ampliﬁer conﬁguration shown
in Figure 3.45. If either of the source-resistor combinations were not present, the inverting ampliﬁer
remains, and we know that transfer function. By superposition, we know that the input-output
relation is
