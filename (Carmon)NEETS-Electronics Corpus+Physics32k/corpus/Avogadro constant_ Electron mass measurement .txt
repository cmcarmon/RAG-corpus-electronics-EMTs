The Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA) publishes values for physical constants for international use. It determines the Avogadro constant from the ratio of the molar mass of the electron Ar(e)Mu to the rest mass of the electron me:

{\displaystyle N_{\rm {A}}={\frac {A_{\rm {r}}({\rm {e}})M_{\rm {u}}}{m_{\rm {e}}}}.}

The relative atomic mass of the electron, Ar(e), is a directly measured quantity, and the molar mass constant, Mu, is a defined constant in the SI. The electron rest mass, however, is calculated from other measured constants:

{\displaystyle m_{\rm {e}}={\frac {2R_{\infty }h}{c\alpha ^{2}}}.}

As may be observed in the table below, the main limiting factor in the precision of the Avogadro constant is the uncertainty in the value of the Planck constant, as all the other constants that contribute to the calculation are known more precisely.
