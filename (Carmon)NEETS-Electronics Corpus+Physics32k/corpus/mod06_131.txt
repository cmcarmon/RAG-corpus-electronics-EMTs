When electrons are attracted from the space charge to the plate, they are accelerated by the
attraction. Their gain in speed gives them energy that causes them to strike the plate with a considerable
force. As the electrons strike the plate, this energy is converted to heat. The plate must be able to
withstand the associated increase in temperature. The maximum amount of power (watts) that a given
plate can safely dissipate (as heat) is called the PLATE DISSIPATION rating.
