The waveforms in view (B) show the relationship of the input gate and the output signal from the 
pulsed oscillator. To see how this circuit operates, assume that the Q of the LC tank circuit is high enough 
to prevent damping. An output from the circuit is obtained when the input gate goes negative (T0 to T1 
and T2 to T3). The remainder of the time (T1 to T2) the transistor conducts heavily and there is no output 
from the circuit. The width of the input gate controls the time for the output signal. Making the gate wider 
causes the output to be present (or ring) for a longer time.
