Tolman used the following variation of Einstein's thought experiment: Imagine a distance with endpoints



A


{\displaystyle A}
and



B


{\displaystyle B}
. Let a signal be sent from A propagating with velocity



a


{\displaystyle a}
towards B. All of this is measured in an inertial frame where the endpoints are at rest. The arrival at B is given by:




Δ

{\displaystyle \Delta t=t_{1}-t_{0}={\frac {B-A}{a}}.}

Here, the event at A is the cause of the event at B. However, in the inertial frame moving with relative velocity v, the time of arrival at B is given according to the Lorentz transformation:

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\Delta t'&=t'_{1}-t'_{0}={\frac {t_{1}-vB/c^{2}}{\sqrt {1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}}-{\frac {t_{0}-vA/c^{2}}{\sqrt {1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}}\\&={\frac {1-av/c^{2}}{\sqrt {1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}}\Delta t.\end{aligned}}}

It can be easily shown that if a > c, then certain values of v can make Δt' negative. In other words, the effect arises before the cause in this frame. Einstein (and similarly Tolman) concluded that this result contains in their view no logical contradiction; he said, however, it contradicts the totality of our experience so that the impossibility of a > c seems to be sufficiently proven.
