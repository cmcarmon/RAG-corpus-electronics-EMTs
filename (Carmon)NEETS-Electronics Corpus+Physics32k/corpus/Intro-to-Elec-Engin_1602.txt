where Vm is the peak value of the supply voltage. For the case of α < γ , waveforms are shown in
Figure 16.1.13(a) for the motoring operation. It is possible to turn on thyristors T1 and T3 because
ia > 0, even though vs < E. The same is true for thyristors T2 and T4.
When T1 and T3 conduct during the interval α ≤ ωt ≤ (π + α), the following volt–ampere
