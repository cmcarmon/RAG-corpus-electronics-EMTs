Inductor markings 
 
As  with  capacitors,  the  vast  majority  of  inductors 
use  written  markings  to  indicate  values,  working 
current,  and  tolerance.  Some  small  inductors  are 
marked with coloured stripes to indicate their value 
and  tolerance  (in  which  case  the  standard  colour 
values  are  used  and 
is  normally 
expressed in microhenries).
