General requirements of shortwave relay stations:
Road access (fairly universal)
HVAC mains access building or transformer in the transmitter building itself
Staff quarters (if the relay station is not fully automated)
Incoming audio processing centre, but since the mid-1980s this has evolved into one to five rack units
Transmitter hall (50 kW, 100 kW, 250 kW, 300 kW, 500 kW shortwave transmitter)
Switch matrix (but these are not typically used by ALLISS modules)
Baluns (but their use is not always required nor universal)
antenna tuners (sometimes called ATUs or roller coasters because of their appearance)
Feeder lines (coax cable and open feeder lines are the most common feeders in use)
HRS-type antennas, or occasionally log-periodic (horizontal)
In parts of the developing world log-periodic (horizontal) antennas are used to provide less directional gain to a target area.
