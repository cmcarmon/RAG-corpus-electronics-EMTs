To prevent this, you must periodically demagnetize the tape transport. The procedures for doing this 
are identical to those listed in chapter 2 for demagnetizing magnetic heads. You'll even use the same 
manual hand-held degausser you saw in figure 2-8 of chapter 2. Figure 4-17 shows a technician 
demagnetizing a tape guide.
