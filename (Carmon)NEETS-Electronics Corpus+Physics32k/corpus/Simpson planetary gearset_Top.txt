The Simpson planetary gearset consists of two planetary gearsets, both having the same gears and gear ratios. It was employed in automatic transmissions. It was one of the several designs invented by American engineer Howard Simpson. A Simpson gearset delivers three forward gears and one reverse, plus neutral. Actually there are four forward gears, but two of them have exactly the same ratio, so there are three distinct gears. Third gear is always direct drive (1:1).
