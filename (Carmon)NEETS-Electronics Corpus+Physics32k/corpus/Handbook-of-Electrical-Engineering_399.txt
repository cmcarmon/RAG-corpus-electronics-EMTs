Consider a network N with n independent nodes as shown
in Fig. 3.35. The node 1¢ is taken as reference (datum) node.
the voltages V1, V2, . . ., Vn (which are functions of s) are the
transforms of the node-pair voltages (or simply node voltages) v1, v2, . . ., vn (which are function s of t) between
the n nodes and the reference node 1¢ with the plus polarity marks at the n nodes. It can be shown [Aitken,
1956] that the matrix equation for the n independent nodes of N is given by
