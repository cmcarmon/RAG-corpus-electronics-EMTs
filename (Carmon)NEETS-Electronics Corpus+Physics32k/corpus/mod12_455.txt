This circuit operates on the same principles of phase shifting as did the Foster-Seeley discriminator.
In that discussion, vector diagrams were used to illustrate the voltage amplitudes and polarities for
conditions at resonance, above resonance, and below resonance. The same vector diagrams apply to the
ratio detector but will not be discussed here. Instead, you will study the resulting current flows and
polarities on simplified schematic diagrams of the detector circuit.
