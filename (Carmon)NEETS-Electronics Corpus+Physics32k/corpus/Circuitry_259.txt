Solution 
 
The value of IE can be calculated from IC + IB, thus: 
 
IE = 30 + 0.6 = 30.6 mA. 
 
The  value  of  hFE can  be  found  from  hFE = IC /IB ,
thus: 
 
hFE = IC /IB = 30/0.6 = 50. 
 
Example 5.5 
 
A transistor  operates  with  a  collector  current  of  
97 mA and an emitter current of 98 mA. Determine 
the  value  of  base  current  and  common  emitter 
current gain. 
 
Solution 
 
Since  IC = IC + IB, the base current  will  be  given 
by: 
 
IB = IE . IC = 98 . 97 = 1 mA 
 
The  common-emitter  current  gain  (hFE) will  be 
given by: 
 
hFE = IC /IB = 97/1 = 97.
