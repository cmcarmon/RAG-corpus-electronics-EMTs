NUMBERÂ—(1) A mathematical entity that may indicate quantity or amount of units. (2) Loosely, a 
numeral. An abstract mathematical symbol for expressing a quantity. In this sense, the manner of 
representing the number is immaterial. Take 26, for example; this is its decimal form - but it could be 
expressed as a binary (base 2), octal (base 8), or hexadecimal (base 16) number [13].
