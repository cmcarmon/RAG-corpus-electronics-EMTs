Therefore, there are two identiﬁable beneﬁts of applying a
nonzero clock skew. First, the safety margins of the clock skew
(that is the distances between the clock skew point and the
bounds of the permissible range) in the permissible ranges of a
data path can be improved. The likelihood of correct circuit
operation in the presence of process parameter variations and
operational conditions is improved with these increased margins.
In other words, the circuit reliability is improved. Second,
without changing the logical and circuit structure, the perform-
ance of the circuit can be increased by permitting a higher
maximum clock frequency (or lower minimum clock period).
