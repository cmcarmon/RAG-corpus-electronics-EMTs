A more interesting occurrence is that of non-native signal representation. In
this case, electrical signals are used to represent non-electrical quantities, which
is common in electronic signal processing. For example, consider an electronic
sound amplifier. Such a system might begin with a front-end transducer, such as
a microphone, that converts sound into an electrical signal that represents the
sound. This electrical signal is then amplified, and possibly filtered, to produce
a signal representing the desired output sound. Finally, a back-end transducer,
such as a speaker, converts the processed electrical signal back into sound.
Because electrical signals can be transduced and processed with ease, electronic
circuits provide an amazingly powerful means for information processing, and
have all but replaced native processing. For example, electronic amplifiers have
now replaced megaphones.
