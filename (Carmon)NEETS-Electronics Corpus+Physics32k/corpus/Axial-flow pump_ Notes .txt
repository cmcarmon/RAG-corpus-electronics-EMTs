The fixed diffuser vanes are used to remove the whirl component (

{\displaystyle V_{\rm {w2}}}
) of the discharge velocity of the impeller and to convert the energy to pressure.
The impeller vanes may be adjustable.
The machine may be fitted with pre-entry vanes to eliminate pre-rotation and to make the flow purely axial.
Work done on the fluid per unit weight =

For maximum energy transfer,

Therefore, from outlet velocity triangle, we have
