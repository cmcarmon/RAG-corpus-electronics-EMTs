If  the  two  tuned  circuits  are  too  ‘loosely’ 
coupled    (they  are  said  to  be  under-coupled) the 
frequency response characteristic becomes flat and 
insufficient output is obtained. On the other hand, if 
they  are  too  ‘tightly’  coupled  (they  are  said  to  be 
over-coupled) the  response  becomes  broad  and 
‘double-humped’.  The  optimum  value  of  coupling 
(when  the  two  tuned  circuits  are  said  to  be 
critically-coupled) corresponds  to  a  frequency 
response  that  has  a  relatively  flat  top  and  steep 
sides.
