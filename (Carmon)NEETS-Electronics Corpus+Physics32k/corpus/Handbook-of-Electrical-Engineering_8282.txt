Output Response Analysis
Especially when designing a circuit including some BIST, one must decide how to check the correctness of the
circuit’s  responses  [Bardell  et al.,  1987].  It  is  infeasible  to  store  on-chip  all  expected  responses,  and  thus  a
data
common  solution  is  to  reduce  the  circuit  responses  to  relatively  short  sequences:  this  process  is  called 
  The  normal  conﬁguration  for

input circuit is stimulated by an input pattern generator
data compaction testing is shown in Fig. 85.5. The

< 20); the resulting output vector(s), of length up to 2
, is compacted to a
very short signature of length 
k
 is around 16 to 32 bits). The signature is then compared to
a known good value. The main advantages of this method are that (1) the testing can be done at circuit speed,
(2) there is no need to generate test patterns, and (3) the testing circuitry involves a very small area, especially
if the circuit has been designed using scan techniques (see Section 85.2). The issues revolve around designing
very efﬁcient input generators and compactors.
