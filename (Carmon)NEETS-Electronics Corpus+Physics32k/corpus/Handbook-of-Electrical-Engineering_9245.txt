For requirements, speciﬁcations, user documents, and other software deliverables based on natural language,
the use of word processors and their built-in spelling checkers has minimized the presence of minor spelling
errors. Also available, although not used as widely as spelling checkers, are a variety of automated grammar
and  syntax  checkers  and  even  textual  complexity  analyzers.  Errors  of  clarity  and  ambiguity,  long  a  bane  of
software, can be reduced signiﬁcantly by judicious usage of such tools.
