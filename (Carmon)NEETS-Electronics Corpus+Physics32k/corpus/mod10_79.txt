When a wave passes from one medium into another medium that has a different velocity of
propagation, a change in the direction of the wave will occur. This changing of direction as the wave
enters the second medium is called REFRACTION. As in the discussion of reflection, the wave striking
the boundary (surface) is called the INCIDENT WAVE, and the imaginary line perpendicular to the
boundary is called the NORMAL. The angle between the incident wave and the normal is called the
ANGLE OF INCIDENCE. As the wave passes through the boundary, it is bent either toward or away
from the normal. The angle between the normal and the path of the wave through the second medium is
the ANGLE OF REFRACTION.
