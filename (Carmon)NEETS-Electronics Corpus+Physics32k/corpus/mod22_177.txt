All magnetic tape must be moving at a predetermined speed for data to be read from or written on 
the tape. Data cannot be read or written while the tape is coming up to speed, slowing down, or stopped. 
During this time delay, the tape moves a short distance creating a blank spot on the tape. This interrecord 
gap or interblock gap separates each single record or block of records on the tape. The length of the gap 
varies, depending upon the particular system and method of recording, but is approximately 2/5 to 3/4 
inch in length. If single records are stored on the tape, the interrecord gap may be longer than the portion 
of tape used to store the record. Therefore, much of the tape's recording surface is wasted.
