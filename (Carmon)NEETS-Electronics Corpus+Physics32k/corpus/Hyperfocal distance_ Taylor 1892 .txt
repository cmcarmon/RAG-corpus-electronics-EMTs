John Traill Taylor recalls this word formula for a sort of hyperfocal distance:

We have seen it laid down as an approximative rule by some writers on optics (Thomas Sutton, if we remember aright), that if the diameter of the stop be a fortieth part of the focus of the lens, the depth of focus will range between infinity and a distance equal to four times as many feet as there are inches in the focus of the lens.

This formula implies a stricter CoC criterion than we typically use today.
