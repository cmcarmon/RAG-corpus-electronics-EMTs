Germanium Detectors
High-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors are widely used for gamma-ray spectroscopy due to their combina-
tion of efﬁcient absorption and high energy resolution. Figure 116.7 shows the cross sections for photoelectric
absorption, Compton scattering, and absorption by electron-positron pair production in several materials used
for solid-state nuclear radiation detectors. Attenuation is signiﬁcantly stronger in germanium than in silicon.
Over much of the gamma spectrum, the dominant interaction is Compton scattering. However, it is principally
the stronger photoelectric absorption in germanium that makes it more suitable than silicon for gamma-ray
spectroscopy.  In  the  typical  germanium  detector,  a  gamma-ray  can  be  scattered  several  times  before  it  is
photoelectrically  absorbed.  Thus,  the  energy  of  the  gamma-ray  is  primarily  transmitted  directly  to  a  small
number of electrons. These energetic electrons, in turn, interact with electrons in the valence bands to create
mobile pairs of electrons and holes. The average number of electron-hole pairs N produced by a completely
absorbed  gamma-ray  of  energy  E  becomes  independent  of  the  details  of  the  initial  reaction  path  and  varies
linearly with E:
