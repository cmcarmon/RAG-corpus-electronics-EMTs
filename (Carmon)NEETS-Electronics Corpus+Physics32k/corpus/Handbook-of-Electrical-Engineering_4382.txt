To appreciate the low loss and wide bandwidth capabilities of optical ﬁbers, consider the curves of signal
attenuation versus frequency for three different transmission media shown in Fig. 42.16. Optical ﬁbers have a
“ﬂat’’ transfer function well beyond 100 MHz. When compared with wire pairs of coaxial cables, optical ﬁbers
have far less loss for signal frequencies above a few megahertz. This is an important characteristic that strongly
inﬂuences system economics, since it allows the system designer to increase the distance between regenerators
(ampliﬁers) in a communication system.
