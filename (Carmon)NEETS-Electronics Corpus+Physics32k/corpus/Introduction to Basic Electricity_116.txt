To	make	it	effortless	to	obey	Coulomb’s	Law,	the	determination	of	Coulomb’s
constant	is	recommended.	Once	the	value	of	the	constant	has	been	determined,	not
only	is	it	easier	to	adhere	to	the	aforementioned	law,	you	are	also	ensuring	that	the
calculations	for	the	electric	current	are	valid.
The	formula:
**representations:														CC	=	Coulomb’s	Constant
