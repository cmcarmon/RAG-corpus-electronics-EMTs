An equichordal curve is a closed planar curve for which a point in the plane exists such that all chords passing through this point are equal in length. Such a point is called an equichordal point. It is easy to construct equichordal curves with a single equichordal point, particularly when the curves are symmetric; the simplest construction is a circle.
It has long only been conjectured that no convex equichordal curve with two equichordal points can exist. More generally, it was asked whether there exists a Jordan curve
