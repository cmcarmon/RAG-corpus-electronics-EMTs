electrically  erasable  pRoMs  (eepRoMs) 
can be programmed and erased by using an electrical 
charge. By applying a high voltage (around 21 volts), 
a single byte or the entire chip can be erased in about 
10 milliseconds. Erasing can be done with the chip in 
the circuit. EEPROMs are used where data needs to be 
maintained for later use, such as the custom guide in a 
television satellite system.
