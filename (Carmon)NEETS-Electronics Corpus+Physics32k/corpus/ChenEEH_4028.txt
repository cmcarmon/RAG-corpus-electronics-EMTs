. VASS captures DG in graphical format. It features multi-
projection and the two-level pipeline technique for spaceâ€“
time mapping. An approach to transport all interior I/O
ports to the array boundary is implemented. The output
is the register transfer (RT) level data path synthesis of PE
and associated control signals in net list format.
