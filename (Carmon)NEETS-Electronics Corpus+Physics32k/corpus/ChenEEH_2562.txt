A resonator has an inÔ¨Ånite number of resonant modes that
satisfy the boundary conditions inside the cavity (eigenvalues of
the cavity). Each mode corresponds to a resonant frequency that
is characteristic for the cavity dimensions. At resonance, the
electric We and magnetic Wm energies are equal, and the lowest
resonant frequency is characterized by the fundamental (or
dominant) mode. Regardless of its geometry or shape, a reson-
ator can usually be modeled by either a series or parallel RLC
lumped-element equivalent circuit, and the choice of an equiva-
lent circuit may also depend on a resonant mode in question.
