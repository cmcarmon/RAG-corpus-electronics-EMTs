This part of the hard disk drive transport holds the magnetic read/write heads. There is a separate 
head arm assembly for each of the hard disk platters in the disk pack. Each assembly has four magnetic 
heads, two write heads and two read heads-one pair of heads for each surface of the hard disk platter. The 
head arm assembly is attached to the actuator arm assembly.
