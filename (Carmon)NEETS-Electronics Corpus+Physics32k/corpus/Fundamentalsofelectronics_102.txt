3.1 Voltage, Current, and Generic Circuit Elements1
We know that information can be represented by signals; now we need to understand how signals are
physically realized. Over the years, electric signals have been found to be the easiest to use. Voltage and
currents comprise the electric instantiations of signals. Thus, we need to delve into the world of electricity
and electromagnetism. The systems used to manipulate electric signals directly are called circuits, and they
reÔ¨Åne the information representation or extract information from the voltage or current. In many cases, they
make nice examples of linear systems.
