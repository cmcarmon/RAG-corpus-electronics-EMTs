The SAW electrical network is analyzed using the SAW equivalent circuit model plus the addition of packaging
parasitics  and  any  tuning  or  matching  networks.  Figure 47.7  shows  a  typical  electrical  network  which  is
computer  analyzed  to  yield  the  overall  transfer  function  for  one  port  of  the  two-port  SAW  Ô¨Ålter  [Morgan,
1985].  The  second  port  is  analyzed  in  a  similar  manner  and  the  overall  transfer  function  is  obtained  as  the
product of the electrical, acoustic, and propagation delay line effects.
