 Inductors are classified according to core type. The core is the center of the inductor just as the core 
of an apple is the center of an apple. The inductor is made by forming a coil of wire around a core. The 
core material is normally one of two basic types: soft-iron or air. An iron-core inductor and its schematic 
symbol (which is represented with lines across the top of it to indicate the presence of an iron core) are 
shown, in figure 2-4(A). The air-core inductor may be nothing more than a coil of wire, but it is usually a 
coil formed around a hollow form of some nonmagnetic material such as cardboard. This material serves 
no purpose other than to hold the shape of the coil. An air-core inductor and its schematic symbol are 
shown in figure 2-4(B).
