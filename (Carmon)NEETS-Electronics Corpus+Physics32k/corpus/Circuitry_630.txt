In order to distinguish between the two types of 
reference aerial we use subscripts i and d to denote 
isotropic  and  half-wave  dipole  reference  aerials 
respectively.  As  an  example,  an  aerial  having  a 
gain of 10 dBi produces ten times power gain when 
compared  with  a  theoretical  isotropic  radiator. 
Similarly,  an  aerial  having  a  gain  of  13  dBd
produces twenty times power gain when compared 
with a  half-wave dipole. Putting  this another  way, 
to maintain the same field strength at a given point, 
you  would  have  to  apply  20  W  to  a  half-wave 
dipole or just 1 W to the aerial in question! Some 
representative  values  of  aerial  gain  are  given  in 
Table 13.1.
