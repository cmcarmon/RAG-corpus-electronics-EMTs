Since the Navy uses both copper and aluminum wiring, both copper and aluminum terminals are 
necessary. Various size terminal or stud holes may be found for each of the different wire sizes. A further 
refinement of the solderless terminals and splices is the insulated type. The barrel of the terminal or splice 
is enclosed in an insulated material. The insulation is compressed along with the terminal barrel when it is 
crimped, but is not damaged in the process. This rids you of the need for taping or tying an insulating 
sleeve over the joint.
