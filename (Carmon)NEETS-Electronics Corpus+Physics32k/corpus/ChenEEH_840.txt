Multiple factors affect the propagation delay of the data
signals through the combinational logic gates and intercon-
nect. Because the clock distribution network is composed of
logic gates and interconnection wires, the signals in the clock
distribution network are delayed. Moreover, the dependence of
the correct operation of a system on the signal delay in the
clock distribution network is far greater than on the delay of
the logic gates. Recall that by delivering the clock signal to
registers at precise times, the clock distribution network essen-
tially quantizes the operational time of a synchronous system
into clock periods, thereby permitting the simultaneous exe-
cution of operations.
