Various experiments have been performed which, due to their simplicity, are still used as undergraduate experiments. Mass, velocity, momentum, and energy of electrons have been measured in different ways in those experiments, all of them confirming relativity. They include experiments involving beta particles, Compton scattering in which electrons exhibit highly relativistic properties and Positron annihilation.
