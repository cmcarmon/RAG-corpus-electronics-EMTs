Reduces number of ﬁeld quantities by assuming an impedance relation between tangential 
and 
Reduces surface integral on thin, wirelike object to a line integral by ignoring circumferential 
current and circumferential variation of longitudinal current, which is represented as a
ﬁlament. Generally limited to
