The  materials  of  magneto-optical  recording  have  strong  perpendicular  magnetic  anisotropy.  This  type  of
anisotropy  favors  the “up”  and “down”  directions  of  magnetization  over  all  other  orientations.  The  disk  is
initialized in one of these two directions, say up, and the recording takes place when small regions are selectively
reverse-magnetized by the thermomagnetic process. The resulting magnetization distribution then represents
the pattern of recorded information. For instance, binary sequences may be represented by a mapping of zeros
to up-magnetized regions and ones to down-magnetized regions (non-return to zero or NRZ). Alternatively,
the NRZI scheme might be used, whereby transitions (up-to-down and down-to-up) are used to represent the
ones in the bit-sequence.
