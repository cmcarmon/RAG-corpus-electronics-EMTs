Tr tubes are usually conventional spark gaps enclosed in partially evacuated, sealed glass envelopes,
as shown in figure 2-13. The arc is formed as electrons are conducted through the ionized gas or vapor.
You may lower the magnitude of voltage necessary to break down a gap by reducing the pressure of the
gas that surrounds the electrodes. Optimum pressure achieves the most efficient tr operation. You can
reduce the recovery time, or DEIONIZATION TIME, of the gap by introducing water vapor into the tr
tube. A tr tube containing water vapor at a pressure of 1 millimeter of mercury will recover in 0.5
microseconds. It is important for a tr tube to have a short recovery time to reduce the range at which
targets near the radar can be detected. If, for example, echo signals reflected from nearby objects return to
the radar before the tr tube has recovered, those signals will be unable to enter the receiver.
