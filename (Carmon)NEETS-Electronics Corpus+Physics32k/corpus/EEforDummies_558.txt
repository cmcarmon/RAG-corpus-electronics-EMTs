Rating your diode
Most diodes don’t have values like resistors and capacitors. A diode simply 
does its thing in controlling the on/off flow of electrons, without altering the 
shape or size of the electron flow. But that doesn’t mean all diodes are the 
same. Standard diodes are rated according to two main criteria: peak reverse 
voltage (PRV) and current. These criteria guide you to choosing the right 
diode for a particular circuit, as follows:
