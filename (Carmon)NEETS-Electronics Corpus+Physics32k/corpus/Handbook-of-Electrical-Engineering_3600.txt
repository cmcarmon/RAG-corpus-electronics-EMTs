LECTRIC AND MAGNETIC FORCES are among the ﬁve original forces in the universe. These forces
are important as we are affected by them almost every instant. Electromagnetics is the combined effect
of electric and magnetic ﬁelds. Today’s scientiﬁc development to a great extent is based on the electro-
magnetic ﬁelds, their propagation, and varying effects under different boundary conditions. Very few subjects
are understood as thoroughly as electromagnetics and have such wide applications. Electricity, telephones, radio,
television, datalinks, medical electronics, radar, remote sensing, etc.—all have considerable impact on human
life.  Now  that  impact  is  being  carried  out  further  with  optical  ﬁber  technology,  which  is  also  based  on  the
concept of electromagnetic wave propagation. All of human society has been revolutionized by electromagnetics,
but still our understanding is not complete. As H.G. Wells once wrote, and this is still true, “The past is but a
beginning of a beginning, and all that is and has been is but the twilight of the dawn.”
