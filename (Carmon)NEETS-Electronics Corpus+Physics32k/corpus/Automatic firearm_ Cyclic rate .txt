Self-loading firearms are designed with varying rates of fire due to having different purposes. The speed with which a self-loading firearm can cycle through the functions of:
Fire
Eject
Load
Cock
is called the cyclic rate. In fully automatic firearms the cyclic rate is tailored to the purpose that the gun is made to serve. Anti-aircraft machine guns often have extremely high rates of fire to maximize the probability of a hit. In infantry support weapons these rates of fire are often much lower and in some cases variable within the design of the firearm. The MG 34 is a WWII-era machine gun which today would be referred to as a general purpose machine gun. It came in several variations with a cyclic rate as high as 1200 rounds per minute, but also made an infantry model which fired at 900 rounds per minute.
