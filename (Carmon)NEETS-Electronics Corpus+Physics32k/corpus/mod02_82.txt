 The fourth physical factor is the type of core material used with the coil. Figure 2-8 shows two coils: 
Coil (A) with an air core, and coil (B) with a soft-iron core. The magnetic core of coil (B) is a better path 
for magnetic lines of force than is the nonmagnetic core of coil (A). The soft-iron magnetic core's high
