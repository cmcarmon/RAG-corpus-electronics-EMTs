uses seven LED segments, or bars (labeled A through G in the figure), which can be lit in different 
combinations to form any number from "0" through "9." The schematic, view A, shows a common-anode 
display. All anodes in a display are internally connected. When a negative voltage is applied to the proper 
cathodes, a number is formed. For example, if negative voltage is applied to all cathodes except that of 
LED "E," the number "9" is produced, as shown in view A of figure 3-29. If the negative voltage is 
changed and applied to all cathodes except LED "B," the number "9" changes to "6" as shown in view B.
