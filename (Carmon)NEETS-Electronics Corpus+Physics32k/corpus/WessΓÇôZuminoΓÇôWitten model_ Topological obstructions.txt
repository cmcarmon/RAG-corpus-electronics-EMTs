The extension of the field to the interior of the ball is not unique; the need that the physics be independent of the extension imposes a quanitization condition on the coupling parameter k, the level. Consider two different extensions of γ to the interior of the ball. They are maps from flat 3-space into the Lie group G. Consider now glueing these two balls together at their boundary S². The result of the gluing is a topological 3-sphere; each ball B³ is a hemisphere of S³. The two different extensions of γ on each ball now becomes a map S³ → G. However, the homotopy group π3(G) = ℤ for any compact, connected simple Lie group G.
Thus, one has

where γ and γ' denote the two different extensions onto the ball, and n, an integer, is the winding number of the glued-together map.

Thus, topological considerations lead one to conclude that the level k must be an integer when G is a connected, compact, simple Lie group. For a semisimple or disconnected compact Lie group, the level consists of an integer for each connected, simple component.
This topological obstruction can also be seen in the representation theory of the affine Lie algebra symmetry of the theory. When each level is a positive integer the affine Lie algebra has unitary highest weight representations with highest weights that are dominant integral. Such representations are easier to work with as they decompose into finite-dimensional subalgebras with respect to the subalgebras spanned by each simple root, the corresponding negative root and their commutator, which is a Cartan generator.
Often one is interested in a WZW model with a noncompact simple Lie group G, such as SL(2,ℝ) which has been used by Juan Maldacena and Hirosi Ooguri to describe string theory on a three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space, which is the universal cover of the group SL(2,ℝ). In this case, as π3(SL(2, ℝ)) = 0, there is no topological obstruction and the level need not be integral. Correspondingly, the representation theory of such noncompact Lie groups is much richer than that of their compact counterparts.
