The use of a shunt resistor along with a voltmeter to measure current can be a useful trick
for simplifying the task of frequent current measurements in a circuit. Normally, to measure
current through a circuit with an ammeter, the circuit would have to be broken (interrupted)
and the ammeter inserted between the separated wire ends, like this:
