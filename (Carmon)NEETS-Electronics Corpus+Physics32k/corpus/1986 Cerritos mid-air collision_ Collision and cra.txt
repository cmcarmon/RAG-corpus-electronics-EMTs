On Sunday, August 31, 1986, at approximately 11:46 am, Flight 498 began its initial descent into Los Angeles with 58 passengers and six crew members aboard. At 11:52 am, the Piper's engine collided with the left horizontal stabilizer of the DC-9, shearing off the top of the Piper's cockpit and decapitating Kramer and both of his passengers. The heavily damaged Piper fell onto an empty playground at Cerritos Elementary School.
Simultaneously, the DC-9, with most of its vertical and all of its horizontal stabilizer torn off, inverted, immediately dived and slammed into a residential neighborhood at Holmes Avenue and Reva Circle in Cerritos, crashing into a house at what is today 17915 Holmes Avenue, and exploded on impact. The explosion scattered the DC-9's wreckage across Holmes Avenue and onto Carmenita Road, destroying four other houses and damaging seven more, killing all 64 passengers and crew aboard the jetliner and 15 people on the ground. A fire sparked by the crash contributed significantly to the damage.
