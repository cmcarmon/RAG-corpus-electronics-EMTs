Common drafting tools can be used in the genera tion 
of schematic diagrams. Using schematic  symbol templates 
speeds up the process. However,  computer software pro-
grams are now used to speed up the generation of a sche-
matic diagram. In addition to  computer-aided	design	
(caD) programs,  specialty programs are also available 
and include electronic  circuit simulation programs.
