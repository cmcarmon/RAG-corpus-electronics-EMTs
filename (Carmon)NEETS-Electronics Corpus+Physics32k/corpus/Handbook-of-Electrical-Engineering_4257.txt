Figure 41.5 shows the monopulse beam patterns. The ﬁrst is the received sum pattern that is generated by
a feed that provides the energy from the reﬂector or phased array antenna through two ports in equal amounts
and  summed  in  phase  in  a  monopulse  comparator  shown  in  Fig.  41.6.  The  second  is  the  difference  pattern
generated by providing the energy through the same two ports in equal amounts but taken out with a phase
difference of p radians, giving a null at the center. A target located at the center of the same beam would receive
a strong signal from the sum pattern with which the target could be detected and ranged. The received difference
pattern would produce a null return, indicating the target was at the center of the beam. If the target were off
the  null,  the  signal  output  or  difference  voltage  would  be  almost  linear  proportional  to  the  distance  off  the
center  (off-axis),  as  shown  in  the  ﬁgure.  This  output  of  the  monopulse  processor  is  the  real  part  of  the  dot
product of the complex sums and the difference signals divided by the absolute magnitude of the sum signal
squared, i.e.,
