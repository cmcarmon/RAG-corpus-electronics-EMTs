The  object  of  lag  network  design  is  to  reduce  the  gain  at  frequencies  lower  than  the  original  crossover
frequency in order to reduce the open-loop gain to unity before the phase shift becomes so excessive that the
system PM is too small. A disadvantage of lag network compensation is that the attenuation introduced reduces
