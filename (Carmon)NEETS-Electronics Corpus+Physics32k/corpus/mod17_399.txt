Figure 3-27 is a simplified block diagram of a HALF-DUPLEX (send or receive) uhf, audio-
frequency-tone shift system. A half-duplex communications circuit permits two-way communications 
between stations. Communications can be in either direction but not simultaneously. The term half-duplex 
is qualified by adding send only, receive only, or send or receive. Let's use the block diagram to trace a 
signal through the system.
