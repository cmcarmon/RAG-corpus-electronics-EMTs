The bullwhip effect happens along the supply chain of an organisation. This is when agents along the supply chain fail to pass on relevant and accurate information to their superior, leading to a large variation in the demand of goods and services from the customers and the supply from the organisation. Human behavior is a very important aspect to be considered, as decision making and emotions in the market will make a big difference to the final result of the bullwhip effect. This is because managers who can calmly make decisions while others competitors panic and deliver inaccurate messages often perform better within the industry. When the market is in poor condition, 'fear' can be an important factor affecting managers' decisions. Therefore, human behavior is closely related to people's decisions.
