Current divider circuits also Ô¨Ånd application in electric meter circuits, where a fraction of
a measured current is desired to be routed through a sensitive detection device. Using the
current divider formula, the proper shunt resistor can be sized to proportion just the right
amount of current for the device in any given instance:
