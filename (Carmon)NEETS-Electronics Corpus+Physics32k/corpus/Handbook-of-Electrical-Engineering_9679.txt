Signature scheme: A scheme to generate pairs of signing-verifying keys so that signing messages and verifying
the validity of signatures can be executed efﬁciently when knowing the corresponding key; but without
the  signing  key,  it  is  infeasible  to  forge  a  signature  to  a  new  message  even  when  given  signatures  to
messages of one’s choice.
