Parametric Transducers
The nonlinear interaction of sound waves can be used to produce highly directional sound sources with no
side lobes and small physical apertures. In spite of their inherent inefﬁciency, substantial source levels can be
achieved and such “parametric sonars” have found a number of underwater applications. Parametric receivers
have also been investigated but practical applications have yet to be found.
