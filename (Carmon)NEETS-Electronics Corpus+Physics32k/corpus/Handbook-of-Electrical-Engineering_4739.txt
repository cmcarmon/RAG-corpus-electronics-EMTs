As  noted  previously,  ultrasonic  waves  are  often  used  as  probes  when  the  wavelength  and  attenuation  are
appropriate. For these radar-like applications, the acoustic beam is generated by a transducer and propagates
in the medium containing the scatterer to be investigated as shown in Fig. 48.4(b). The acoustic wave is scattered
by any discontinuity in the medium, and energy is returned to the same or to another transducer. If the outgoing
signal is pulsed, then the delay for the received pulse is a measure of the distance to the scatterer. If the transducer
is  displaced  or  rotated,  the  change  in  delay  of  the  echo  gives  a  measure  of  the  shape  of  the  scatterer.  Any
movement of the scatterer, for example, ﬂowing blood in an artery, causes a Doppler shift of the echo, and this
shift, along with the known direction of the returned beam, gives a map of the ﬂow pattern. Phasing techniques
with multiple transducers or multiple areas of one transducer can be used to produce focused beams or beams
electrically swept in space by differential variation of the phases of the excitation of the component areas of
the transducer.
