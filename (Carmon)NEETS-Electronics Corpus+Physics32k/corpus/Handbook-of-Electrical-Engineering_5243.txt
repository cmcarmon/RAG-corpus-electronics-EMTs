Condenser
The condenser condenses turbine exhaust steam to water, which is pumped back to the steam generator through
various water heaters. The condensation produces a vacuum, which is necessary to exhaust the steam from the
turbine. The condenser is a shell-and-tube heat exchanger, where steam condenses on water-cooled tubes. Cold
water  is  obtained  from  the  cooling  towers  or  other  cooling  systems.  The  condensed  water  is  fed  through  a
deaerator, which removes absorbed gases from the water. Next, the gas-free water is mixed with the feedwater
and returned to the boiler. The gases absorbed in the water may cause corrosion (oxygen) and increase condenser
pressure, adversely affecting efÔ¨Åciency. Older plants use a separate deaerator heater, while deaerators in modern
plants  are  usually  integrated  in  the  condensor,  where  injected  steam  jets  produce  pressure  drop  and  remove
absorbed gases.
