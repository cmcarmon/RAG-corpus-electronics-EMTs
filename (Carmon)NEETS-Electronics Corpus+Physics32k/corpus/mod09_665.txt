voltage will be 10 âˆ’ 1.9 volts, or 8.1 volts. C2 will charge to 10 percent of 8.1 volts, or .81 volt. The 
voltage on C2 will become 1 + .9 + .81, or 2.71 volts. Successive input pulses will raise C2 by 10 percent 
of the remaining voltage toward 10 volts until the blocking oscillator works. If the oscillator bias is set so 
that Q1 begins conduction at 3.8 volts, this will continue until 3.8 volts is exceeded. Since the fourth step 
is 3.5 volts and the fifth is 4.1 volts, the 3.8-volt level is crossed at the fifth step. If the oscillator goes 
through 1 cycle of operation every fifth step and C2 is discharged at this point, this circuit would be a 5-
to-1 divider.
