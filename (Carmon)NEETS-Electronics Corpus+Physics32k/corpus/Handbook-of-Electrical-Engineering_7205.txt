Assume  that  a  spectral  bandwidth  of  1.2  MHz  can  be  divided  into  120  radio  channels  with  a  channel
bandwidth of 10 kHz. This is an FDMA scheme. A spectral bandwidth of 1.2 MHz can also be divided into 40
radio  channels  with  a  radio  channel  bandwidth  of  30  kHz  but  each  radio  channel  carries  three  time  slots.
Therefore,  a  total  of  120  time-slot  channels  is  obtained.  This  is  a  TDMA  scheme.  A  spectral  bandwidth  of
1.2 MHz can also be used as one radio channel but provide 40 code-sequence trafﬁc channels for each sector
of a cell. A cell of three sectors will have a total of 120 trafﬁc channels. This is a CDMA scheme. Now we can
visualize that as far as channel efﬁciency is concerned, TDMA, FDMA, and CDMA provide the same number
frequency reuse
of trafﬁc channels. However, in FDMA or TDMA, frequency reuse has to be applied. Let the 
‡
factor
 18 dB; then the total channels will be divided by 7 as:
