Floppy disk drive units are physically smaller than magnetic disk drive units and are typically used 
with personal (desktop) computers (fig. 2-22). The unit consists of a disk drive in which the disk rotates 
and a controller containing the electronic circuitry that feeds signals onto and from the disk. The disk 
(diskette) is a thin, flexible platter (floppy disk) coated with magnetic material so characters can be 
recorded on the surface in the form of magnetized spots. Floppy disks come in several sizes from 3 to 8 
inches in diameter. The most common are the 8-inch disk, the 5 1/4-inch disk, and the 3 1/2-inch disk.
