This example shows a very safe circuit to work with. 9 volts hardly constitutes a shock
hazard, and so there is little to fear in breaking this circuit open (bare handed, no less!) and
connecting the meter in-line with the ï¬‚ow of electrons. However, with higher power circuits,
this could be a hazardous endeavor indeed. Even if the circuit voltage was low, the normal
current could be high enough that an injurious spark would result the moment the last meter
probe connection was established.
