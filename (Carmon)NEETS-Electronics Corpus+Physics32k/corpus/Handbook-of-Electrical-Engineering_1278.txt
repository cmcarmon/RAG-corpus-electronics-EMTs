In this expression, the forward data matrix X is given by (14.132) while Jn designates the order reversal matrix
whose  elements  are  all  zero  except  for  ones  which  appear  along  its  main  antidiagonal  [i.e.,  Jn(i,j)  = d(i,n  +
Jp+1 appearing in the lower half of the data matrix (14.134) corresponds to the backward

Jp+1 are seen to have a Toeplitz and Hankel structure, respectively.
prediction equations. The matrices X and JN–p
The combined forward-backward data matrix Xfb is therefore said to have a block Toeplitz-Hankel structure.
