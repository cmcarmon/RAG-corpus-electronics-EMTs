A key issue in applying hidden Markov modeling for recognition of speech signals is the matching of the
energy contour of the signal to the energy contour of the model for that signal. Energy matching is required
for two main reasons. First, speech signals are not strictly stationary and hence their energy contours cannot
be  reliably  estimated  from  training  data.  Second,  recording  conditions  during  training  and  testing  vary.  An
approach for gain adaptation was developed [Ephraim, 1992]. In this approach, HMMs for gain-normalized
clean signals are designed and used together with gain contour estimates obtained from the noisy signals. The
gain  adaptation  approach  is  implemented  using  the  EM  algorithm.  This  approach  provides  robust  speech
recognition at input SNRs greater than or equal to 10 dB.
