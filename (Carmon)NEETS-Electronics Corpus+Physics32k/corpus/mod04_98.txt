There are several different types of crimping tools used with copper terminals. However, you will 
normally be concerned only with wire sizes AWG (American Wire Gauge) 10 or smaller. For wire of 
these sizes, a small plier-type crimper is used to crimp on uninsulated terminals, as shown in figure 2-12. 
The small plier-type crimper has several sizes of notches for the different size terminals. Care should be 
used to select the correct size crimping tool for the particular terminal.
