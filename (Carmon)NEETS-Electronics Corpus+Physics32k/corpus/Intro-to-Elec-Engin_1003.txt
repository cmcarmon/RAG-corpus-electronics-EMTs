In the conventional dc machine (with a closed continuous commutator winding on its
armature), for example, full-wave rectiﬁcation of the alternating voltage induced in individual
armature coils is achieved by means of a commutator, which makes a unidirectional voltage
available to the external circuit through the stationary carbon brushes held against the commutator
surface. The armature windings of dc machines are located on the rotor because of this necessity for
commutation and are of the closed continuous type, known as lap and wave windings. The simplex
lap winding has as many parallel paths as there are poles, whereas the simplex wave winding
always has two parallel paths. The winding connected to the commutator, called the commutator
winding, can be viewed as a pseudostationary winding because it produces a stationary ﬂux when
carrying a direct current, as a stationary winding would. The direction of the ﬂux axis is determined
by the position of the brushes. In a conventional dc machine, in fact, the ﬂux axis corresponds
to the brush axis (the line joining the two brushes). The brushes are located so that commutation
(i.e., reversal of current in the commutated coil) occurs when the coil sides are in the neutral
zone, midway between the ﬁeld poles. The axis of the armature mmf is then in the quadrature
axis, whereas the stator mmf acts in the ﬁeld (or direct) axis. Figure 12.2.4 shows schematic
representations of a dc machine. The commutator is thus a device for changing the connections
between a rotating closed winding and an external circuit at the instants when the individual
coil-generated voltages reverse. In a dc machine, then, this arrangement enables a constant and
unidirectional output voltage. The armature mmf axis is ﬁxed in space because of the switching
