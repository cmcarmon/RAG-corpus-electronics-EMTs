As depicted in Figure 2.69, the same simplification can be made for a
dependent source in which the guiding branch variable is a current. Figure 2.69a
shows a circuit containing a current controlled current source with the control
port marked and all branch variables labeled explicitly. Figure 2.69b shows the
