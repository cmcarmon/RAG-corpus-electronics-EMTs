In this section we will discuss the two most commonly employed transistors for microwave applications, the
metal-semiconductor ﬁeld-effect transistor (MESFET) [Liechti, 1976] and the bipolar transistor (BJT) [Cooke,
1971]. These two transistors are commonly employed in practical microwave systems as ampliﬁers, oscillators,
and gain blocks. The transistors have replaced many two-terminal devices due to their improved performance
and ease of use. Transistors are readily integrated into both hybrid and monolithic integrated circuit environ-
ments (MICs). This, in turn, has resulted in signiﬁcantly reduced size, weight, and dc power consumption, as
well  as  increased  reliability  and  mean  time  to  failure  for  systems  that  use  these  components.  Transistors  are
easily biased and the two-port network conﬁguration leads naturally to inherent separation between input and
output networks.
