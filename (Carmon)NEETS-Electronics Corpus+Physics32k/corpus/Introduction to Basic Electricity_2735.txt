After	completing	this	chapter,	the	student	will	be	
able	to:
Identify	the	formulas	for	determining	capacitive	
and	inductive	reactance.
Identify	how	AC	current	and	voltage	react	in	
capacitors	and	inductors.
Determine	the	reactance	of	a	series	circuit,	and	
identify	whether	it	is	capacitive	or	inductive.
Define	the	term	impedance.
Solve	problems	for	impedance	that	contain	both	
resistance	and	capacitance	or	inductance.
Discuss	how	Ohmâ€™s	law	must	be	modified	
before	using	it	for	AC	circuits.
Solve	for	XC,	XL,	X,	Z,	and	IT	in	RLC	series	circuits.
Solve	for	IC,	IL,	IX,	IR,	and	IZ	in	RLC	parallel	
circuits.
