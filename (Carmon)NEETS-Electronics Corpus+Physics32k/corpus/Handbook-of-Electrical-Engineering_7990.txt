Multifunction Arithmetic Logic Units
Devices that can provide a variety of addition, subtraction, and logical operations can be easily designed around
the adders/subtracters presented in the previous sections. The logic diagram of the ﬁrst two stages of an n-bit
multifunction ALU is given in Fig. 81.55. Operand inputs for the device are X = xn–1 . . . x1x0 and Y = yn–1 . . .
y1y0 and the output is S = sn–1 . . . s1s0. The function performed on the operand(s) is determined by the values
of the control inputs k2, k1, k0, and cin as shown in Table 81.7. The given realization is based on a ripple-carry
adder for simplicity of presentation. However, the same design approach can be used with other adders such
as carry lookahead.
