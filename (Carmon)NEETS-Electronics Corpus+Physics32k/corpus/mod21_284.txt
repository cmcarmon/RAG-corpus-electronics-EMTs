You should be aware that devices made by different manufacturers may appear to have slightly
different signatures. This is normal, especially with digital integrated circuits, and does not necessarily
indicate a failed device. When this occurs, the best way to verify this is to compare the outputs of the
device under test with the equipment specifications to ensure the signals are adequate for proper
equipment operation.
