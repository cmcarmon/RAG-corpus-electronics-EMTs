A germanium diode has a low forward resistance 
of several hundred V. The reverse resistance is high, 
greater than 100,000 V. Silicon diodes have a higher 
forward and reverse resistance than germanium. An 
ohmmeter test of a diode should show a low forward 
resistance and a high reverse resistance.
