Spacecraft and Systems
A  satellite  spacecraft  employs  several  major  subsystems.  These  are  propulsion,  electrical,  tracking,  telemetry
command and control, and the communications subsystem. Figure 102.4 is a diagram of a typical commercial
satellite. The propulsion subsystem consists of thrusters oriented in north-south and east-west directions and is
used to maintain the spacecraft in the proper orbit and orientation. An electrical subsystem is used to generate
electricity in the spacecraft by means of solar cells. Backup batteries are used during periods of equinoxes. The
solar cells are also used to charge the batteries. The tracking, telemetry, and command subsystem is used to receive
commands from the controlling ground station, as well as to allow the ground station to monitor on-board systems.
The spacecraft requires some form of stabilization to prevent it from tumbling in space. There are two types
of  stabilization  techniques:  spin  stabilization  and  three-axis  stabilization.  Spin  stabilization  uses  an  outside
cylinder to spin, creating the effect of a gyroscope providing spacecraft stabilization. An internal platform is
decoupled from the cylinder, whose orientation is ﬁxed towards the earth. Three-axis stabilization uses internal
gyros which sense movement of the spacecraft. Any movement in the axes is detected and can be compensated
by ﬁring thruster jets.
