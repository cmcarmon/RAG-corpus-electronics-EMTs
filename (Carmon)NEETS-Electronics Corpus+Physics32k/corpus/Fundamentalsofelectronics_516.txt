We now combine terms that have the same frequency index in magnitude. Because the signal is real-valued,
∗ or A−k = Ak and B−k = −Bk.
the coeﬃcients of the Fourier series have conjugate symmetry: c−k = ck
After we add the positive-indexed and negative-indexed terms, each term in the Fourier series becomes
. To obtain the classic Fourier series (4.11), we must have 2Ak = ak and
