The forces on the piston face and the Piston Head Retainer vary depending on what Piston Head retention system is used.
If a circlip (or any non preloaded system) is used, the force acting to separate the Piston Head and the Cylinder Shaft shoulder is the applied pressure multiplied by the area of the Piston Head. The Piston Head and Shaft shoulder will separate and the load is fully reacted by the Piston Head Retainer.
If a preloaded system is used the force between the Cylinder Shaft and Piston Head is initially the Piston Head Retainer preload value. Once pressure is applied this force will reduce. The Piston Head and Cylinder Shaft shoulder will remain in contact unless the applied pressure multiplied by Piston Head area exceeds the preload.
The maximum force the Piston Head Retainer will see is the larger of the preload and the applied pressure multiplied by the full Piston Head area. It is interesting to note that the load on the Piston Head Retainer is greater than the external load, which is due to the reduced shaft size passing through the Piston Head. Increasing this portion of shaft reduces the load on the Retainer.
