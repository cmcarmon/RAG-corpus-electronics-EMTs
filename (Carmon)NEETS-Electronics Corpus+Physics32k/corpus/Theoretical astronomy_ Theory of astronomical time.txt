Until recently all the time units that appear natural to us are caused by astronomical phenomena:
Earth's orbit around the Sun => the year, and the seasons,
Moon's orbit around the Earth => the month,
Earth's rotation and the succession of brightness and darkness => the day (and night).
High precision appears problematic:
amibiguities arise in the exact definition of a rotation or revolution,
some astronomical processes are uneven and irregular, such as the noncommensurability of year, month, and day,
there are a multitude of time scales and calendars to solve the first two problems.
Some of these time scales are sidereal time, solar time, and universal time.
