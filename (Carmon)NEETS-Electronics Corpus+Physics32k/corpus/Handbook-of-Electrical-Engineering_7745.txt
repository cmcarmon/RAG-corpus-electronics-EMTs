Disk caches can become even more useful if they are made nonvolatile using the battery back-up techniques
described in the previous subsection (and with the same potential problems). A nonvolatile cache will allow
“fast writes”: the application need not wait for the write I/O to actually complete before it is notiﬁed that it
has  completed.  For  some  applications  environments,  disk  caches  have  the  beneﬁcial  effect  of  reducing  the
number of reads and thus the number of I/O requests seen by the disks. This has the interesting side effect of
increasing the percentage of writes found in the I/O mix, and some observers believe that writes may dominate
I/O performance in future systems.
