Figure 5.5: A three-bit A/D converter assigns voltage in the range [−1, 1] to one of eight integers
between 0 and 7. For example, all inputs having values lying between 0.5 and 0.75 are assigned the
integer value six and, upon conversion back to an analog value, they all become 0.625. The width of a
single quantization interval ∆ equals 2
2B . The bottom panel shows a signal going through the analog-
to-digital converter, where B is the number of bits used in the A/D conversion process (3 in the case
depicted here). First it is sampled, then amplitude-quantized to three bits. Note how the sampled signal
waveform becomes distorted after amplitude quantization. For example the two signal values between 0.5
and 0.75 become 0.625. This distortion is irreversible; it can be reduced (but not eliminated) by using
more bits in the A/D converter.
