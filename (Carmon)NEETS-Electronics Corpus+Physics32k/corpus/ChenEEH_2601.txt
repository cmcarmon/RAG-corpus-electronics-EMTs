categorized as stub type, E- or H-plane type, dual-mode type,
or ﬁlters with corrugated geometry. Most of the resonator
sections are coupled through evanescent mode waveguide
sections. Among them are E-plane ﬁlters that are most suitable
for mass-fabrication. In contrast, popular dual-mode and
crosscoupled ﬁlters are very special designs requiring very
particular knowledge in design and tuning.
