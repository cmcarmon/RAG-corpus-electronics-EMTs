There are many ways to physically realize a lag network transfer function. Since the network only attenuates
at  some  frequencies,  as  it  never  has  a  gain  greater  than  1  at  any  frequency,  it  can  be  realized  with  passive
components  only.  Figure  100.14  presents  an  electrical  realization  of  the  simple  lag  network.  Figure  100.15
presents a ﬂowchart illustrating the design procedure envisioned here for lag network design. This is concep-
tually very similar to that for a lead network and makes use of the ﬁve-step parameter optimization procedure
suggested earlier.
