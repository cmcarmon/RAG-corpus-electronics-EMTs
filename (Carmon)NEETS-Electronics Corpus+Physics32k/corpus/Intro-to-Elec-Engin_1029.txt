where L11 is the self-inductance of winding 1, L22 is the self-inductance of winding 2, and
L12 = L21 = M is the mutual inductance between windings 1 and 2. All of these in-
ductances are generally functions of the angle θm (mechanical or spatial variable) between
the magnetic axes of windings 1 and 2. Neglecting the iron-circuit reluctances, the electro-
magnetic torque can be found from either the energy or the coenergy stored in the mag-
netic ﬁeld of the air-gap region by applying either Equation (12.4.17) or (12.4.18). For a
linear system, the energy or the coenergy stored in a pair of mutually coupled inductors is
given by
