The ability to produce graphical output of the results of an analysis has made the use of computers in all
engineering ﬁelds, not just power system analysis, much easier. Tabulated results are never easy to interpret.
They are also often given to a greater degree of accuracy than the input data warrants. A graph of the results,
where appropriate, can make the results very easy to interpret and if there is also an ability to graph any variable
with any other, or two if three dimensions can be utilized, then new and possibly signiﬁcant information can
be quickly assimilated.
