processors that each operate on data with a different
instruction. This type of machine structure is not very
useful and has never been implemented in real systems.
4. Multiple instruction, multiple data (MIMD) machines
refer to a number of processors executing different
instructions on different data streams simultaneously.
This is the most common multiprocessor structure; the
symmetrical multiprocessor (SMP), clusters, and non-
uniform memory access (NUMA) systems are all exam-
ples of this category.
