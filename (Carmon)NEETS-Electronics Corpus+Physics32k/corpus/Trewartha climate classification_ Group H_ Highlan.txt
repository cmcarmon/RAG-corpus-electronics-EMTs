Highland climates, in which altitude plays a role in determining climate classification. Specifically, this would apply if correcting the average temperature of each month to a sea-level value using the formula of adding 5.6 °C (10.1 °F) for each 1,000 meters (3,300 ft) of elevation would result in the climate fitting into a different thermal group than that into which the actual monthly temperatures place it.
Sometimes G is used instead of H if the above is true and the altitude is between 500 and 2,500 meters (1,600 and 8,200 ft), but the G or H is placed in front of the applicable thermal letter rather than replacing it. The second letter used reflects the corrected monthly temperatures, not the actual monthly temperatures. G stands for glacier for instances.
