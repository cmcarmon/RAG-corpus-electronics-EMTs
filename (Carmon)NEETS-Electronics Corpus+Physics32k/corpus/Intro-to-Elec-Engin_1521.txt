where Ac, ωc, and φc are the peak amplitude, angular frequency, and phase angle of the mod-
ulated carrier, respectively. Equation (15.3.17) can be viewed as a carrier Ac cos(ωct + φc)
modulated by a digital signal d(t) that is 0 or 1 in a given bit interval. The digital signal and
product device shown in Figure 15.3.14 are then equivalent to the waveform formatter and
modulator. Assuming that the received signal sR(t) differs only in amplitude from sASK(t), one
can write
