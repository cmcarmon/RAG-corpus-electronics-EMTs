The logarithmic dependence on the delay (delay = log[N]) is only valid under the assumption that the gate
delay is constant without depending on the fan-out and fan-in of the gate. In practice this is not true and even
when the bipolar technology (which does not exhibit strong dependence on the fan-out) is used to implement
CLA structure, the further expansion of the carry-block is not possible given the practical limitations on the
fan-in of the gate.
