Fiber optic systems have many attractive features that are superior to electrical systems. These
include improved system performance, immunity to electrical noise, signal security, and improved safety
and electrical isolation. Other advantages include reduced size and weight, environmental protection, and
overall system economy. Table 1-1 details the main advantages of fiber optic systems.
