Figure 3.2 is a lumped-parameter model of the transformer
in Figure 3.1, with both the primary and secondary solidly
grounded. If the secondary is open-circuited, the only current
that ﬂows is an exciting current in the primary winding. This
exciting current contains only odd harmonics and is composed
of a core loss component and a magnetizing component. The
core loss component is in phase with the induced voltage, and
the magnetizing component is lagging the induced voltage by
908 (i.e., in phase with the magnetizing ﬂux). The core loss is
represented in Figure 3.2 by bm, and it is composed of both
hysteresis and eddy current losses. Hysteresis losses are directly
proportional to the frequency, and eddy current losses vary
proportionally to the square of frequency.
