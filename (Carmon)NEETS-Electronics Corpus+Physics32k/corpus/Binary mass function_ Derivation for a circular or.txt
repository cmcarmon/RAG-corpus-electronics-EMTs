The peak radial velocity



K


{\displaystyle K}
is the semi-amplitude of the radial velocity curve, as shown in the figure. The orbital period




P


o
r
b





{\displaystyle P_{\mathrm {orb} }}
is found from the periodicity in the radial velocity curve. These are the two observable quantities needed to calculate the binary mass function.
The observed object of which the radial velocity can be measured is taken to be object 1 in this article, its unseen companion is object 2.
Let

The peak radial velocity of object 1,



K


{\displaystyle K}
, depends on the orbital inclination



i


{\displaystyle i}
(an inclination of 0° corresponds to an orbit seen face-on, an inclination of 90° corresponds to an orbit seen edge-on). For a circular orbit (orbital eccentricity = 0) it is given by

{\displaystyle i=90^{\circ }}
. The true mass




M

2




{\displaystyle M_{2}}
depends on the orbital inclination. The inclination is typically not known, but to some extent it can be determined from observed eclipses, be constrained from the non-observation of eclipses, or be modelled using ellipsoidal variations (the non-spherical shape of a star in binary system leads to variations in brightness over the course of an orbit that depend on the system's inclination).
