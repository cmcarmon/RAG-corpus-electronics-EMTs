When a liquid drop impacts the surface of a liquid reservoir, it will either float, bounce, coalesce with the liquid reservoir, or splash. In the case of floating, a drop will float on the surface for several seconds. Cleanliness of the liquid surface is reportedly very important in the ability of drops to float. Drop bouncing can occur on perturbed liquid surfaces. If the drop is able to rupture a thin film of gas separating it from the liquid reservoir, it can coalesce. Finally, higher Weber number drop impacts (with greater energy) produce splashing. In the splashing regime, the impacting drop creates a crater in the fluid surface, followed by a crown around the crater. Additionally, a central jet, called the "Rayleigh jet," or "Worthington jet" protrudes from the center of the crater. If the impact energy is high enough, the jet rises to the point where it pinches off, sending one or more droplets upward out of the surface.
