In celestial mechanics, apsidal precession or orbital precession is the precession (rotation) of the orbit of a celestial body. More precisely, it is the gradual rotation of the line joining the apsides of an orbit, which are the points of closest and farthest approach. Perihelion is the closest point to the Sun. The apsidal precession is the first derivative of the argument of periapsis, one of the six primary orbital elements of an orbit.
