11. As we shall see in Chapter 9, it turns out that voltages and currents in circuits result in electric
and magnetic fields, thus appearing to violate the set of constraints to which we promised to adhere.
In most cases these are negligible. However, when their effects cannot be ignored, we explicitly
model them using elements called capacitors and inductors.
