In using this sensor to measure blood pressure the dome is coupled to a ﬂexible plastic tube, and the dome
 As described by Pascal’s Law, the pressure in the dome,
and tube are ﬁlled with a physiological saline solution.

and hence against the diaphragm, will be the same as that at the tip of the tube provided the tip of the tube is
at the same horizontal level as the dome. Thus by threading the tube into a blood vessel, an invasive procedure,
the  blood  pressure  in  that  vessel  can  be  transmitted  to  the  dome  and  hence  the  diaphragm  of  the  pressure
transducer. The pressure transducer will, therefore, sense the pressure in the vessel. This technique is known
as external direct blood pressure measurement, and the ﬂexible plastic tube that enters the blood vessel is known
as a catheter. It is important to remember that the horizontal level of the blood pressure transducer dome must
be the same as that of the tip of the catheter in the blood vessel to accurately measure the pressure in that vessel
without adding an error due to the hydrostatic pressure in the catheter.
