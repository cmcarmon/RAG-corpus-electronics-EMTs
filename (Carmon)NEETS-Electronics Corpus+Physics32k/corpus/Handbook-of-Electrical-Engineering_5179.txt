Essentially, the smart materials can be adopted in two regimes of the system shown in Fig. 58.3. The sensing unit
can be zones of an integrated set of smart material that senses the response of the parent system on a real time
basis. (Sometimes, conventional sensors/tranducers can serve this purpose, as well.) The actuating unit, built-in as
a part of the parent structure, consists of a smart material, which upon receiving the electric signal from the feedback
loop modiﬁes the response of the parent system, as dictated by the input signal. Thus, the actuation is based on
the synergism between the electric input to the corresponding material property of the parent structure being altered.
The feedback control unit may consist of decision logic, which can relatively modify the error signal being
fed to the actuator. The decision logic refers to, for example, response linearization, time-averaged smoothing,
amplitude-limiting,  and  bandwidth  control.  On  the  basis  of  the  general  schematic  depicted  in  Fig.  58.3,  the
following discusses a few examples of application-speciﬁc intelligent systems using smart materials.
