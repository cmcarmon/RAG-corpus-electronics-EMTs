It  is  possible  to  create  a  binary  code  for  which  the  valid  code  words  are  a  subset  of  the  total  number  of
possible combinations of 1s and 0s. If the code words are formed correctly, errors introduced into a code word
will force it to lie in the range of illegal, or invalid, code words, and the error can be detected. This is the basic
that  the  code  word  is
concept  of  the 
structured such that it is possible to determine the correct code word from the corrupted, or erroneous, code
word.
