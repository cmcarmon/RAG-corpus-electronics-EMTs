When reusing the available frequency spectrum by multiple spatially isolated beams (SDMA), interference
can result if the sidelobes of one beam receives or transmits substantial energy in the direction of the other
beams. Two beams that point in the same direction may reuse frequencies provided that they are orthogonally
polarized, for example, vertical and horizontal linear polarizations or right- and left-hand circular polarizations.
Typical values of sidelobe or polarization isolation among beams reusing the same frequency bands are from
27 to 35 dB.
