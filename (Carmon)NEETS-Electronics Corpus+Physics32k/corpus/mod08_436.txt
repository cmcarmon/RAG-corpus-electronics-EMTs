Now that you have seen the basic operation of a saturable-core reactor, there is one other idea to
discuss before moving on to the circuitry of a magnetic amplifier. There is a point upon the magnetization
curve where the saturable-core reactor should be operated. The ideal operating point is the place in which
a small increase in control current will cause a large increase in output power and a small decrease in
control current will cause a large decrease in output power. This point is on the flattest portion of the
permeability curve (after its peak).
