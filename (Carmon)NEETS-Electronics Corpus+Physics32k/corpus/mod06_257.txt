As we said earlier, Cpg has the greatest effect on the tube operation. This is because this capacitance
will couple part of the ac signal from the plate back to the grid of the tube. The process of coupling the
output of a circuit back to the input is called FEEDBACK. This feedback affects the gain of the stage. It
may be desirable in some applications. In others, the effects must be neutralized. The effects of Cpk are
greater at higher frequencies where Xc is lower.
