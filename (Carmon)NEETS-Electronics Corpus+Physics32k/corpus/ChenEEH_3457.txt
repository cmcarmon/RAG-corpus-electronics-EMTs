Energizing a transformer causes a transient behavior of the
currents at the transformer primary due to so-called magnetiz-
ing inrush current. As a voltage is applied on an unloaded
transformer, the nonlinear nature of the magnetizing induc-
tance of the transformer causes the magnetizing current to
experience an initial value as high as 8â€“30 times the full-load
