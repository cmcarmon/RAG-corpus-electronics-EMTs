The amplitude of the jump voltage was calculated to be 0.5 volt. The sawtooth portion of the wave is 
linear because the time, T0 to T1, is only 10 percent of the total charge time. The amplitude of the 
trapezoidal wave is approximately 5 volts. The electrical length is the same as the input gate length, or 
1,000 microseconds. Linearity is affected in the same manner as in the sawtooth generator. Increasing R2 
or C2, or decreasing gate width, will improve linearity. Changing the applied voltage will increase output 
amplitude, but will not affect linearity.
