Reactance




X



{\displaystyle \scriptstyle X}
is the imaginary part of the impedance; a component with a finite reactance induces a phase shift




θ



{\displaystyle \scriptstyle \theta }
between the voltage across it and the current through it.

A purely reactive component is distinguished by the sinusoidal voltage across the component being in quadrature with the sinusoidal current through the component. This implies that the component alternately absorbs energy from the circuit and then returns energy to the circuit. A pure reactance will not dissipate any power.
