The one-dimensional array has the freedom of steering the
main beam only in one plane: u or f. The concept may
be extended to an array in two-dimensions, as shown in
Figure 6.22, to allow beam steering both in u and f. As
shown in this ﬁgure, consider an array of (m  n) elements
placed on the x–y plane, with uniform amplitudes of excita-
tion. The interelement spacing is dx along the x axis and dy
along the y axis, which are in general different from each other.
The interelement phasing is ax and ay, respectively, along the
x and y axes. The interelement phasing can be independently
controlled to allow steering in both u and f.
