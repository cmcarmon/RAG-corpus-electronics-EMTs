0]. However, Eq. (100.175) and (100.177) are also in the form of Eq. (100.172), facilitating
and T = [.5
an H∞ design that minimizes the H∞ norm of the transfer function from the disturbance d to the controlled
variable z. We can compare this design to an H2 controller design that minimizes the H2 norm (Eq. (100.176)).
The two controllers will therefore minimize different norms of the same transfer function.
