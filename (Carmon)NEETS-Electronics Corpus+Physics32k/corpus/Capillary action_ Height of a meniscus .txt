{\displaystyle h={{2\gamma \cos {\theta }} \over {\rho gr}},}

where




γ



{\displaystyle \scriptstyle \gamma }
is the liquid-air surface tension (force/unit length), θ is the contact angle, ρ is the density of liquid (mass/volume), g is the local acceleration due to gravity (length/square of time), and r is the radius of tube. Thus the thinner the space in which the water can travel, the further up it goes.
For a water-filled glass tube in air at standard laboratory conditions, γ = 0.0728 N/m at 20 °C, ρ = 1000 kg/m3, and g = 9.81 m/s2. For these values, the height of the water column is

{\displaystyle h\approx {{1.48\times 10^{-5}} \over r}\ {\mbox{m}}.}

Thus for a 2 m (6.6 ft) radius glass tube in lab conditions given above, the water would rise an unnoticeable 0.007 mm (0.00028 in). However, for a 2 cm (0.79 in) radius tube, the water would rise 0.7 mm (0.028 in), and for a 0.2 mm (0.0079 in) radius tube, the water would rise 70 mm (2.8 in).
