While there has been concern that FUDGE would restrict its "open" license and thus force Fate to change to a different underlying mechanic, such fears have subsided once FUDGE itself was released under the Open Gaming License. Fate has an associated Yahoo! Group to discuss the gaming system and share settings and conversions of other role-playing games.
