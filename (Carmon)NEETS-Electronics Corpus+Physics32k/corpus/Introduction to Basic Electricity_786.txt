several virtual test instruments for analyzing 
the performance of a PCB: a DC power  supply 
to  provide variable power output; a function 
 generator to produce waveforms; a multimeter for 
voltage, current, and resistance measurement; an 
oscilloscope to record waveforms; and a probe for 
simple voltage measurements.
