The use of computers to process pictures is about 30 years old. While some work was done more than 50 years
ago, the year 1960 is usually the accepted date when serious work was started in such areas as optical character
, and the space program. NASA’s Ranger moon mission was one of the ﬁrst programs
recognition, 
to return digital images from space. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) established one of the early general-
purpose image processing facilities using second-generation computer technology.
