There are two basic types of single mode step-index fibers: matched clad and depressed clad.
Matched cladding means that the fiber cladding consists of a single homogeneous layer of dielectric
material. Depressed cladding means that the fiber cladding consists of two regions: the inner and outer
cladding regions. Matched-clad and depressed-clad single mode step-index fibers have unique refractive
index profiles.
