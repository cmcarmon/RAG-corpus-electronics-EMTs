In this chapter, which is based on Szidarovszky and Bahill [1992], we ﬁrst discuss stability in general and then
present four techniques for assessing the stability of a system: (1) Lyapunov functions, (2) ﬁnding the eigenvalues
for  state-space  notation,  (3)  ﬁnding  the  location  in  the  complex  frequency  plane  of  the  poles  of  the  closed-
loop  transfer  function,  and  (4)  proving  bounded  outputs  for  all  bounded  inputs.  Proving  stability  with
Lyapunov functions is very general: it works for nonlinear and time-varying systems. It is also good for doing
proofs.  Proving  the  stability  of  a  system  with  Lyapunov  functions  is  difﬁcult,  however,  and  failure  to  ﬁnd  a
Lyapunov function that proves a system is stable does not prove that the system is unstable. The next techniques
we present, ﬁnding the eigenvalues or the poles of the transfer function, are sometimes difﬁcult, because they
require factoring high-degree polynomials. Many commercial software packages are now available for this task,
however. We think most engineers would beneﬁt by having one of these computer programs. Jamshidi et al.
