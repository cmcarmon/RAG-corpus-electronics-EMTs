Compared with the numbers obtained earlier in Section 4.3 using graphical
analysis for E = 3 V, we see that piecewise linear analysis using an approximate
model for the diode has yielded reasonably accurate results (6 mA versus 5 mA
for iD, and 3 V versus 2.5 V for vR).
Intuition also tells us that when E = âˆ’5 V, the open circuit segment
applies. For the negative input voltage, vD is negative. From Equation 4.35,
when vD is negative, the diode is OFF. In this segment, from Equations 4.38
and 4.39, both iD and vR are 0.
