Some reasoning strategies are general, whereas others are
speciﬁc to particular knowledge representation schemes.
Goal-driven and data-driven strategies are general reasoning
strategies. In data-driven reasoning, from the conditions that
are known to be true, we reason forward to establish new
conclusions. In contrast, in goal-driven reasoning, we reason
backward from a goal state toward the conditions necessary to
make it true. In addition, representation-speciﬁc reasoning
methods have been developed for the various types of expert
systems, including rule-based systems, frame-based systems,
logic systems, model-based systems, object-oriented systems,
fuzzy logic systems, blackboard systems, and many others.
