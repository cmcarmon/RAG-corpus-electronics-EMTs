where VT is the device threshold voltage set more or less by the
technology. It is important to mention also that the current
ﬂowing across the transistor channel is inversely proportional
to VT so a decrease in VT will lead to an increase in the current
and faster switching, as shown in Figure 5.21. At this level, one
can reduce the power consumption by using techniques such
as joint supply voltage–threshold voltage reduction as well as
multiple threshold and variable threshold techniques (Pedram
and Rabaey, 2002).
