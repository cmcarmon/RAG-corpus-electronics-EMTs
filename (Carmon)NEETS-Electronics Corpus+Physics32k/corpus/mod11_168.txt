The electron-resonance magnetron is the most widely used for microwave frequencies because it has 
reasonably high efficiency and relatively high output. The average power of the electron-resonance 
magnetron is limited by the amount of cathode emission, and the peak power is limited by the maximum 
voltage rating of the tube components. Three common types of anode blocks used in electron-resonance 
magnetrons are shown in figure 2-27.
