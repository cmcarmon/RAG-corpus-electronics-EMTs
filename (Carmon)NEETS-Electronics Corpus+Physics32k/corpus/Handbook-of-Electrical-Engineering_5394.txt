For  high-efﬁciency  III-V-based  PV  cells,  such  as  the  GaSb  device,  economic  considerations  demand  that
TPV systems operate a PV cell at power densities of about 1 W cm–2. The geometry of the TPV system also has
a major impact on power density for the converter. For example, it would be technically desirable to evacuate
the  region  between  the  emitter  and  cell  to  reduce  convection  losses  or  to  place  a  ﬁlter  in  this  region,  but
economic  considerations  may  render  these  improvements  impracticable.  In  the  cylindrical  geometry,  if  the
