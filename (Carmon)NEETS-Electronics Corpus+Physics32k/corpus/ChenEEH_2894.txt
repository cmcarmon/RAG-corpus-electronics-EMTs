Figure 10.4(A) shows the principle of triangular FM–CW
ranging on a single target with no Doppler shift. The range
information is contained in the frequency difference between
the signal echo and the radar’s present transmitting frequency.
If there is no Doppler frequency, the difference frequency is a
measure of the target range, which is given by:
