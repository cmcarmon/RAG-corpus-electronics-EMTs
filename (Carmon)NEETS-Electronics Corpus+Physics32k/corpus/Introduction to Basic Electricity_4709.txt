arithmetic instructions affect the arithmetic 
logic unit. The most powerful instructions are add, 
subtract, increment, and decrement. These instruc-
tions allow the microprocessor to compute and ma-
nipulate data. They differentiate a computer from a 
random logic circuit. The result of these instructions is 
placed in the accumulator.
