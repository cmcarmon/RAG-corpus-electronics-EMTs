a systematic algebraic approach for determining both the forced and the natural components
of a network response, is then taken up in Section 3.3. The concept of a transfer function is
also introduced along with its application to solve circuit problems. Then, in Section 3.4 the
network response to sinusoidal signals of variable frequency is investigated. Also, two-port
networks and block diagrams, in terms of their inputâ€“output characteristics, are dealt with in
this chapter. Finally, computer-aided circuit simulations using PSpice and PROBE, as well as
MATLAB are illustrated in Sections 3.5 and 3.6. The chapter ends with a case study of practical
application.
