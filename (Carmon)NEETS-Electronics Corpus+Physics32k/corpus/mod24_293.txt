Manufacturers use a variety of techniques to buffer optical fibers. The types of fiber buffers include
tight-buffered, loose-tube, and gel-filled loose-tube. Figure 3-13 shows each type of fiber buffer. The
choice of buffering techniques depends on the intended application. In large fiber count commercial
applications, manufacturers use the loose-tube buffers. In commercial building and Navy applications,
manufacturers use tight buffers.
