Since both armature and ﬁeld circuits carry direct current in the case of a dc machine, they can
be connected either in series or in parallel. When the armature and ﬁeld circuits are connected in
parallel, the machine is known as a shunt machine. In the shunt machine, the ﬁeld coils are wound
with a large number of turns carrying a relatively small current. When the circuits are connected
in series, the machine is known as a series machine. The ﬁeld winding in the series machine
carries the full armature current and is wound with a smaller number of turns. A dc machine
provided with both a series-ﬁeld and a shunt-ﬁeld winding is known as a compound machine. In
the compound machine, the series ﬁeld may be connected either cumulatively, so that its mmf adds
to that of the shunt ﬁeld, or differentially, so that the mmf opposes. The differential connection is
used very rarely. The voltage of both shunt and compound generators (or the speed, for motors) is
controlled over reasonable limits by means of a ﬁeld rheostat in the shunt ﬁeld. The machines are
said to be self-excited when the machine supplies its own excitation of the ﬁeld windings, as in
the cases just deﬁned. The ﬁeld windings may be excited separately from an external dc source,
however. A small amount of power in the ﬁeld circuit can control a large amount of power in
the armature circuit. The dc generator may then be viewed as a power ampliﬁer. Some possible
ﬁeld-circuit connections of dc machines are shown in Figure 13.1.8.
