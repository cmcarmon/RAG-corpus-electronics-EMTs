As an air parcel moves about in the atmosphere, its relative, planetary and stretching vorticities may change but equation (17) shows that the sum of the three must be conserved following the geostrophic motion.
Equation (17) can be used to find




q



{\displaystyle {q}}
from a known field




Φ



{\displaystyle {\Phi }}
. Alternatively, it can also be used to predict the evolution of the geopotential field given an initial distribution of




Φ



{\displaystyle {\Phi }}
and suitable boundary conditions by using an inversion process.
More importantly, the quasi-geostrophic system reduces the five-variable primitive equations to a one-equation system where all variables such as





u

g





{\displaystyle {u_{g}}}
,





v

g





{\displaystyle {v_{g}}}
and




T



{\displaystyle {T}}
can be obtained from




q



{\displaystyle {q}}
or height




Φ



{\displaystyle {\Phi }}
.
Also, because





ζ

g





{\displaystyle {\zeta _{g}}}
and






V

g


→




{\displaystyle {\overrightarrow {V_{g}}}}
are both defined in terms of




Φ
(
x
,
y
,
p
,
t
)



{\displaystyle {\Phi (x,y,p,t)}}
, the vorticity equation can be used to diagnose vertical motion provided that the fields of both




Φ



{\displaystyle {\Phi }}
and






∂
Φ


∂
t





{\displaystyle {\partial \Phi  \over \partial t}}
are known.
