The primary difference between static and dynamic methods
is that, in the latter, CS insertions will not be part of the initial
routing but will be made as and when required for fault
reconﬁguration (or in general, circuit reconﬁguration for per-
forming other functions like testing and diagnosis) and only to
those nets connected to cells along reconﬁguration paths. The
dynamic method will thus signiﬁcantly reduce the number of
CSs required for FT, thereby making it easier to retain total
functionality with much lower track overheads. Further, it
allows reconﬁguration paths from faulty cells to spare ones to
be chosen dynamically, thus maximizing FT ﬂexibility. The
paths can have any arbitrary shape unlike the predetermined
straight horizontal paths in the static NC method. The needed
CSs can then be put in dynamically along any such chosen
path. Since the conﬁguration bits can be transposed along
reconﬁguration paths of any shape in FPGAs with incremental
run-time-reconﬁguration (RTR) capabilities, coupled with dy-
namic CS insertion, this allows reconﬁguration around many
more fault patterns than possible with the static method (e.g.,
fault clusters).
