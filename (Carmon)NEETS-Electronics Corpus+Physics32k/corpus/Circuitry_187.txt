Frequency 
 
The  frequency  of  a  repetitive  waveform  is  the 
number of cycles of the  waveform which occur in 
unit time. Frequency is expressed in Hertz, Hz, and 
a frequency of 1 Hz is equivalent to one cycle per 
second.  Hence,  if  a  voltage  has  a  frequency  of  
400 Hz, 400 cycles of it will occur in every second.   
  The equation for the voltage shown in Fig. 4.1(a) 
at a time, t, is: 
 
v = Vmax  sin (20 t)
