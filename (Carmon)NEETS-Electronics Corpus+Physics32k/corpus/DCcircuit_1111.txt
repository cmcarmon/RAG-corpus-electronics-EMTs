A battery with a capacity of 1 amp-hour should be able to continuously supply a current of
1 amp to a load for exactly 1 hour, or 2 amps for 1/2 hour, or 1/3 amp for 3 hours, etc., before
becoming completely discharged. In an ideal battery, this relationship between continuous
current and discharge time is stable and absolute, but real batteries don’t behave exactly as
this simple linear formula would indicate. Therefore, when amp-hour capacity is given for a
battery, it is speciﬁed at either a given current, given time, or assumed to be rated for a time
period of 8 hours (if no limiting factor is given).
