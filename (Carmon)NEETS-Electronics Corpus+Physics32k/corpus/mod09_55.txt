NOTE: Remember that the total opposition to a.c. is called impedance (Z). Impedance is the 
combination of inductive reactance (XL), capacitive reactance (XC), and resistance (R). When dealing 
with a.c. circuits, the impedance is the factor with which you will ultimately be concerned. But, as you 
have just been shown, the resistance (R) is not affected by frequency. Therefore, the remainder of the 
discussion of a.c. circuits will only be concerned with the reactance of inductors and capacitors and will 
ignore resistance.
