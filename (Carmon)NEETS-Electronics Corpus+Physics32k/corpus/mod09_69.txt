Lastly, look at the area of the curves to the right of f. This area shows the relative reactances of the 
circuit at frequencies ABOVE resonance. To these HIGHER frequencies, XL will always be greater than 
XC. There will always be some inductive reactance left in the circuit after all capacitive reactance has 
been cancelled. The inductor symbol shows that to these higher frequencies, the circuit will always appear 
to have some inductance. Because of this, there will be a phase shift.
