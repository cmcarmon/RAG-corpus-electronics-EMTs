Mathematical Modeling of Two-Port Networks via z Parameters
In  order  to  produce  a  mathematical  model  of  circuits  represented  by  Fig. 3.50,  we  must  Ô¨Ånd  relationships
among V1 , I1, V2 , and I2. Let us visualize placing a current source at the input and a current source at the output.
Thus, we have selected two of the variables, I1 and I2. We call these variables the independent variables. The
remaining  variables,  V1   and  V2 ,  are  dependent  upon  the  selected  applied  currents.  We  call  V1   and  V2   the
dependent variables. Using superposition we can write each dependent variable as a function of the independent
variables as follows:
