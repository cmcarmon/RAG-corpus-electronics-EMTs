The Lorentz factor is defined as:




γ
=

−



v

c

=

−

β

=



d
t


d
τ





{\displaystyle \gamma ={\frac {1}{\sqrt {1-{\frac {v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}}={\frac {1}{\sqrt {1-\beta ^{2}}}}={\frac {dt}{d\tau }}}

where:
v is the relative velocity between inertial reference frames,
β is the ratio of v to the speed of light c.
τ is the proper time for an observer (measuring time intervals in the observer's own frame),
t is coordinate time
c is the speed of light in a vacuum.
This is the most frequently used form in practice, though not the only one (see below for alternative forms).
To complement the definition, some authors define the reciprocal:




α

{\displaystyle \alpha ={\frac {1}{\gamma }}={\sqrt {1-{\frac {v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}}\ ,}
