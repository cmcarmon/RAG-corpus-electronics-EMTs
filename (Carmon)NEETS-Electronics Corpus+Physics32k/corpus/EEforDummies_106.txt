A flat‚Äêscreen liquid crystal display (LCD) or plasma TV consists of millions 
of tiny picture elements, or pixels, each of which is a red, blue, or green light 
that can be switched on or off electronically. The electronic circuits in the TV 
control the timing and on/off state of each pixel, thus controlling the pattern 
painted across the TV screen, which is the image you see.
