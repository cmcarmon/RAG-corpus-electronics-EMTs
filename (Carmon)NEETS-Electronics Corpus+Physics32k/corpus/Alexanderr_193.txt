As  mentioned  earlier,  a  linear  circuit  with  a  variable  load  can  be
replaced by the Thevenin equivalent, exclusive of the load. The equiv-
alent network behaves the same way externally as the original circuit.
Consider a linear circuit terminated by a load 
, as shown in Fig. 4.26(a).
The current 
across the load are
easily  determined  once  the  Thevenin  equivalent  of  the  circuit  at  the
loadâ€™s terminals is obtained, as shown in Fig. 4.26(b). From Fig. 4.26(b),
we obtain
