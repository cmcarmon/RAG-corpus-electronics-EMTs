From Eq. (53.8), we ﬁnd that a ﬂux density applied parallel to the surface of a semi-inﬁnite superconductor
.  In  other  words,  a  bulk
will  decay  away  exponentially  from  the  surface  on  a  spatial  length  scale  of  order 
superconductor will exclude an applied ﬂux as predicted by the Meissner effect.
