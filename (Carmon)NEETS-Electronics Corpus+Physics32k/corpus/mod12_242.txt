In chapter 1 you learned that modulation of a carrier frequency was necessary to allow fast
communications between two points. As the volume of transmissions increased, a need for more reliable
methods of communication was realized. In this chapter you will study angle modulation and pulse
modulation. These two types of modulation have been developed to overcome one of the main
disadvantages of amplitude modulation - susceptibility to noise interference. In addition, a special
application of pulse type modulation for ranging and detection equipment will be discussed.
