Now let's look at a series-negative limiter with positive bias, as shown in figure 4-8, view (A). Here 
we will remove all of the negative alternation and part of the positive alternation of the input signal. We 
have given a full explanation of the series-positive limiter, series-positive limiter with bias, series-
negative limiter, and series-negative limiter with negative bias; therefore, you should have little difficulty 
understanding what is happening in the circuit in the figure.
