The specification above is incomplete, because for any object or system the magnitude of the compressibility depends strongly on whether the process is adiabatic or isothermal. Accordingly, isothermal compressibility is defined:





β

T


=
−


1
V




(



∂
V


∂
p



)


T




{\displaystyle \beta _{T}=-{\frac {1}{V}}\left({\frac {\partial V}{\partial p}}\right)_{T}}

where the subscript T indicates that the partial differential is to be taken at constant temperature.
Isentropic compressibility is defined:





β

S


=
−


1
V




(



∂
V


∂
p



)


S




{\displaystyle \beta _{S}=-{\frac {1}{V}}\left({\frac {\partial V}{\partial p}}\right)_{S}}

where S is entropy. For a solid, the distinction between the two is usually negligible.
