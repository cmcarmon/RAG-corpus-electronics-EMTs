A de Sitter universe has no ordinary matter content but with a positive cosmological constant (



Λ


{\displaystyle \Lambda }
) that sets the expansion rate,



H


{\displaystyle H}
. A larger cosmological constant leads to a larger expansion rate:




H
∝


Λ


,


{\displaystyle H\propto {\sqrt {\Lambda }},}

where the constants of proportionality depend on conventions.

It is common to describe a patch of this solution as an expanding universe of the FLRW form where the scale factor is given by




a
(
t
)
=

e

H
t


,


{\displaystyle a(t)=e^{Ht},}

where the constant



H


{\displaystyle H}
is the Hubble expansion rate and



t


{\displaystyle t}
is time. As in all FLRW spaces,



a
(
t
)


{\displaystyle a(t)}
, the scale factor, describes the expansion of physical spatial distances.
Unique to universes described by the FLRW metric, a de Sitter universe has a Hubble Law that is not only consistent through all space, but also through all time (since the deceleration parameter is



q
=
−
1


{\displaystyle q=-1}
), thus satisfying the perfect cosmological principle that assumes isotropy and homogeneity throughout space and time. There are ways to cast de Sitter space with static coordinates (see de Sitter space), so unlike other FLRW models, de Sitter space can be thought of as a static solution to Einstein's equations even though the geodesics followed by observers necessarily diverge as expected from the expansion of physical spatial dimensions. As a model for the universe, de Sitter's solution was not considered viable for the observed universe until models for inflation and dark energy were developed. Before then, it was assumed that the Big Bang implied only an acceptance of the weaker cosmological principle, which holds that isotropy and homogeneity apply spatially but not temporally.
