Rarely do complex programs run to completion on the first attempt. Often, time spent debugging and 
testing equals or exceeds the time spent in program coding. This is particularly true if insufficient time 
was spent on program definition and logic development. Some common mistakes which cause program 
bugs are mistakes in coding punctuation, incorrect operation codes, transposed characters, keying errors, 
and failure to provide a sequence of instructions (a program path) needed to process certain conditions.
