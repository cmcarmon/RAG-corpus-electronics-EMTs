The simple model of source and load, shown in Figure 4.3, is an extremely useful 
way to predict how two circuits will interact when connected together. The source part 
can be used to represent the output of a circuit, while the load can be used to represent the 
input of another circuit. The value of ZLOAD can be determined from the equivalent circuit 
model of the load circuit using KVL and KCL. The value of ZSOURCE can be determined 
by Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits. The voltage across the load can simply be 
calculated from,
