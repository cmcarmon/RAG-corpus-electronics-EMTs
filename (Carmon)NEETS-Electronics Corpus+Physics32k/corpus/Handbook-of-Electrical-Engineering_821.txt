Theorems 12.1, 12.2, and 12.3 guarantee, respectively, the stability, asymptotic stability, and global asymptotic
stability of the equilibrium state, if a Lyapunov function is found. Failure to ﬁnd such a Lyapunov function
does not mean that the system is unstable or that the stability is not asymptotic or globally asymptotic. It only
means that you were not clever enough to ﬁnd a Lyapunov function that proved stability.
