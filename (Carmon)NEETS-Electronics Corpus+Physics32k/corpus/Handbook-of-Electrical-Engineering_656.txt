The complex envelope Ëœx(t) carries all of the information, except the carrier frequency, of the original bandpass
signal x(t). This means that if the complex envelope of a signal is given, then that signal is completely characterized.
Knowing the carrier frequency, in addition, means that the original bandpass signal can be reconstructed.
