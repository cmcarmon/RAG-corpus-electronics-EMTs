Hvat is also used as a basis for the unit of volume, called "kubni hvat", often colloquially abbreviated to "kubik" in both languages (though note that the same abbreviation is used for cubic meter). This could be translated as "cubic hvat" (analogous to cubic fathom).
If calculated from hvat, one cubic hvat would equal 6.820992 cubic meters. General Encyclopedia of the Yugoslav Lexicographical Institute, however, lists "metriƒçki hvat", most commonly used to measure firewood, equal to 4 cubic meters.
