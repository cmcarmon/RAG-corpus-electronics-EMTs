You can purchase a complete Arduino Starter Kit — including a microcon­
troller, IDE, project book, breadboard, cables, servomotor, photoresistor, 
tilt sensor, temperature sensor, and other discrete components — for less 
than $85 on https://store.arduino.cc. (And eBay lists some knock‐off 
Arduino kits with gobs of cool extras for around $50.) These comprehensive 
microcontroller kits enable you to program circuits to interact with your 
environment, take readings from sensors, make decisions based on those 
readings, and execute actions based on those decisions. Arduino can provide 
you with an entrée into the field of robotics. Check out Arduino For Dummies 
by John Nussey (Wiley Publishing, Inc.), and keep an eye on the growing field 
of user‐friendly microcontrollers, because new features (such as integrated 
Wi‐Fi) and competitive products are appearing on the market.
