In Chapter 11, you find out how logic gates (AND, OR, NAND, and so on) pro­
cess bits (1s and 0s) of data and that you can purchase specialized integrated 
circuits (ICs) that contain logic gates. Chapter 11 also shows you a basic 
circuit diagram of a half‐adder circuit that uses just two logic gates. Circuits 
such as the half‐adder form the foundation of computer architectures. By 
connecting multiple logic gates in just the right way, you can create circuits 
that compute, store, and control information (series of 1s and 0s organized 
into groups of 8 called bytes). Start your journey into the fascinating field 
of computer architecture by building digital logic circuits that use LEDs as 
output indicators. (Check out www.doctronics.co.uk/4008.htm for a 
detailed description of how to build a 4‐bit binary full adder.)
