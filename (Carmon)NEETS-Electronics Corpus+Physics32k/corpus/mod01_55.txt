Today there is scarcely anyone on board a Navy ship who does not use electrical or electronic
equipment. This equipment is needed in systems of electric lighting and power, intercommunications,
radio, radar, sonar, loran, remote metering, weapon aiming, and certain types of mines and torpedoes. The
Navy needs trained operators and technicians in this challenging field of electronics and electricity. It is to
achieve this end that this module, and others like it, are published.
