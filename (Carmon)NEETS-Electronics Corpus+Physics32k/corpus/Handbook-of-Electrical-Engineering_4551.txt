Computing the Solution Matrix
Once the direct matrix has been computed, the solution can be obtained numerically using various approaches,
ranging from inversion of the direct matrix to developing a solution via iteration as summarized in Table 45.10.
A precautionary comment is in order with respect to the accuracy with which the solution matrix might be
obtained. As computer speed and storage have increased, the number of unknowns used in modeling has also
increased, from a few tens in earlier years to hundreds of thousands now when using IE models and millions
of  unknowns  when  using  DE  models.  The  increasing  number  of  operations  involved  in  solving  these  larger
