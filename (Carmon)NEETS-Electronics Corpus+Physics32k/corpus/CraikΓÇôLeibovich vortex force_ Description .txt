The CL vortex force finds its origins in the appearance of the Stokes drift in the convective acceleration terms in the mean momentum equation of the Euler equations or Navier–Stokes equations. For constant density, the momentum equation (divided by the density

The CL vortex force can be obtained by several means. Originally, Craik and Leibovich used perturbation theory. An easy way to derive it is through the generalized Lagrangian mean theory. It can also be derived through a Hamiltonian mechanics description.
