Because it takes energy to force electrons to ﬂow against the opposition of a resistance, there
will be voltage manifested (or ”dropped”) between any points in a circuit with resistance be-
tween them. It is important to note that although the amount of current (the quantity of
electrons moving past a given point every second) is uniform in a simple circuit, the amount
of voltage (potential energy per unit charge) between different sets of points in a single circuit
may vary considerably:
