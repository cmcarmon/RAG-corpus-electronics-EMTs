The function of the radar transmitter is to generate an electro-
magnetic signal to illuminate the target. The transmitters can be
classiﬁed into the oscillators and power ampliﬁers. The power
ampliﬁers can be divided into three groups: the linear beam
O-type, the cross-ﬁeld M-type, and the solid-state type ampli-
ﬁers. The O-type power ampliﬁers are characterized by high
gain, high power capability, low noise, and large size. Typical
O-type tubes include klystrons, travelling wave tubes, and
twystrons. The cross-ﬁeld M-type ampliﬁers are characterized
by low gain, moderate to high power capability, moderate noise,
wide bandwidth, and small size. Typical M-type tubes include
cross-ﬁeld ampliﬁers and magnetrons. The solid-state transmit-
ters have lower voltage requirements and poor operation at
higher frequency bands. Solid-state devices for ampliﬁers in-
clude bipolar junction transistors, ﬁeld effect transistors, trans-
ferred-electron devices, and avalanche transit-time devices.
