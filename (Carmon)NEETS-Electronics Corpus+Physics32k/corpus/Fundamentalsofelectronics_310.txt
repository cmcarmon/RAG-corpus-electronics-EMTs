(a) What is the Thévenin equivalent circuit?
(b) What voltage will appear if we place a 1F capacitor across the terminals?
Problem 3.25: Mystery Circuit
We want to determine as much as we can about the circuit lurking in the impenetrable box shown in
Figure 3.66. A voltage source vin = 2 volts has been attached to the left-hand terminals, leaving the right
terminals for tests and measurements.
(a) Sammy measures v = 10 V when a 1 Ω resistor is attached to the terminals. Samantha says he is
