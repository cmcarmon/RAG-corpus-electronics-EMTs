When switch S1 of the circuit in figure 3-9 is closed at t0, the source voltage (ES) is instantly felt across
the entire circuit. Graph (A) of the figure shows an instantaneous rise at time t0 from zero to source voltage
(ES = 6 volts). The total voltage can be measured across the circuit between points 1 and 2. Now look at
graph (B) which represents the charging current in the capacitor (ic).  At time t 0, charging current is
MAXIMUM.  As time elapses toward time t
