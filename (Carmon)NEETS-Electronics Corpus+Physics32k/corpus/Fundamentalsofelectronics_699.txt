Problem 5.10: Just Whistlin’
Sammy loves to whistle and decides to record and analyze his whistling in lab. He is a very good whistler; his
whistle is a pure sinusoid that can be described by sa (t) = sin (4000t). To analyze the spectrum, he samples
his recorded whistle with a sampling interval of TS = 2.5× 10−4 to obtain s (n) = sa (nTS). Sammy (wisely)
decides to analyze a few samples at a time, so he grabs 30 consecutive, but arbitrarily chosen, samples. He
calls this sequence x (n) and realizes he can write it as
