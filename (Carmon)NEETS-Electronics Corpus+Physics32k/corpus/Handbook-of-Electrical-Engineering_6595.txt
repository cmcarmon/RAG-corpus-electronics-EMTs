Commercial token rings use wire interconnections or optical data links to join stations at rates in the 10-
Mb/s range. Actual network use is less than 10 Mb/s because of the time it takes an empty token to pass around
the ring. This transit-time delay increases linearly with the number of stations. It includes propagation delay
between stations and processing delay at each station, which must examine the header of every packet before
repeating the bits to the next station.
