Since 1953, radio amateurs have been experimenting with lunar communications by reflecting VHF and UHF signals off the moon. Moonbounce allows communication on earth between any two points that can observe the moon at a common time.
Since the moon's mean distance from earth is 239,000 miles (385,000 km), path losses are very high. It follows that a typical 240 dB total path loss places great demand on high-gain receiving antennas, high-power transmissions, and sensitive receiving systems. Even when all these factors are observed, the resulting signal level is often just above the noise.
Because of the low signal-to-noise ratio, as with amateur-radio practice, EME signals can generally only be detected using narrow-band receiving systems. This means that the only aspect of the TV signal that could be detected is the field scan modulation (AM vision carrier). FM broadcast signals also feature wide frequency modulation, hence EME reception is generally not possible. There are no published records of VHF/UHF EME amateur radio contacts using FM.
