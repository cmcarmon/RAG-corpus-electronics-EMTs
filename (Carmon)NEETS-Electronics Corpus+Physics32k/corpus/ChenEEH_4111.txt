When v and u remain unchanged, we have ASK. When A(t)
and u remain unchanged, we have binary (or M-ary) FSK.
When A(t) and v remain unchanged, we have binary (or
M-ary) PSK (these methods are covered in more detail in
Section 2.6). Hybrid systems exist where two characteristics
are changed with each new symbol transmitted. The most
common method is to ﬁx v and change A(t) and u. This
method is known as quadrature amplitude modulation
(QAM). Each of the modulation methods results in a different
transmitter and receiver design, different occupied bandwidth,
and different error rates. In the remainder of this section, we
examine the methods used for GSM and DECT and calculate
their error rates. Since all signals have a theoretical bandwidth
that is inﬁnite, all modulation methods must be band-limited.
The band-limiting introduces detection errors, and the ﬁlter
bandwidths must be chosen to optimize trade-offs between
bandwidth and error rates.
