LED’s cannot be powered directly from a voltage source as shown in Figure 6.7, 
circuit a, due of the sensitivity of their current-voltage relationship. Since mV differences 
in  the  applied  voltage  can  drastically  alter  their  operating  current,  manufacturing 
variations would make it impossible to control their current flow this way. When an LED 
is powered using a voltage source, a current-limiting resistor should be used, as shown 
Figure 6.7, circuit b. For example, suppose that the turn-on voltage of the LED is 2.1V 
and the voltage source is the output of a 3.3V microprocessor. The resistor is chosen to 
operate the LED at the specified maximum operating current of 10mA, according to the 
following simple analysis.  Given the 2.1V turn-on voltage drop, 3.3 - 2.1 = 1.2 V will be 
dropped  across  the  resistor.  The  desired  operating  current  is  10mA,  and  therefore  the 
necessary resistance is 1.2 V / 10 mA = 120 Ω.
