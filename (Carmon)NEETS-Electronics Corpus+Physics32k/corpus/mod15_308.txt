If you can obtain a gyroscope top, you can do some instructive experiments with it. Hold the gyro 
top with its axis vertical as shown in figure 3-2 and start it spinning. As long as it is spinning fast, it will 
stay balanced. You can balance it on a string or on the point of your finger; the axis will stay vertical as 
long as the top is spinning fast. As we mentioned before, this ability of a gyro to keep its axis fixed in 
space is called RIGIDITY.
