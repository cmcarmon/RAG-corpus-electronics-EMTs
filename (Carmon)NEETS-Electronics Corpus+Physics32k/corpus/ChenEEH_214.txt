A commonly used multiterminal circuit element
is an
operational ampliﬁer (op-amp). It is usually built from linear
resistors and bipolar
transistors.
The behavior of an operational ampliﬁer is often simpliﬁed
and its circuit is modeled as a linear multiterminal element.
Over the limited range of the op-amp input voltage, the
relationship between the op-amp input and output voltages
is assumed to be linear. The nonlinearity of the op-amp circuit
elements is employed in such a way that the behavior of
the op-amp can be approximated with a simple linear charac-
teristic. Nevertheless, even in the case of such simpliﬁcation,
the saturation of the op-amp characteristic for larger values
of
input voltages needs to be taken into account. This
makes the op-amp a nonlinear element. The op-amp circuit
symbol and its
simpliﬁed characteristic are shown in
Figure 5.3.
