The information that is obtained from reliability analysis is very much governed by the nature of the system.
The accepted breakdown of a power system containing generation, transmission, and distribution is into three
hierarchical levels. The ﬁrst level is for the generation facilities alone, the second level contains generation and
transmission, while the third level contains generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. Much of the
early work was focused on the generation facilities. The reasons for this was that, ﬁrst, more information was
available about the generation; second, the size of the problem was smaller; and, third, the emphasis of power
systems was placed in generation. With the onset of deregulation, distribution and customer requirements are
now considered paramount.
