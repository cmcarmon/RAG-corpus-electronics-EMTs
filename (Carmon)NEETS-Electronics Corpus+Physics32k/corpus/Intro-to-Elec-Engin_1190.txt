For a motor, the terminal voltage is always greater than the generated emf, and the electromagnetic
torque produces rotation against a load. For a generator, the terminal voltage is less than the
generated emf, and the electromagnetic torque opposes that applied to the shaft by the prime
mover. If the magnetic circuit of the machine is not saturated, note that the ﬂux φ in Equations
(13.4.3) and (13.4.4) is proportional to the ﬁeld current If producing the ﬂux.
