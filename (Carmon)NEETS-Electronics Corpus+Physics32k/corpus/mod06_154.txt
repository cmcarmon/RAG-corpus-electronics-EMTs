DeForest had certainly hit on something. Now the problem was to find out what would happen when
a negative potential was applied to the grid. This is shown in view (C) of figure 1-15. When De Forest
applied -3 volts to the grid, he found that plate current decreased to half of what it was when the grid had
no voltage applied. The reason for this is found in the principle of "likes repel." The negatively charged
grid simply repelled some of the electrons back toward the cathode. In this manner, the attractive effect of
the plate was decreased, and less current flowed to the plate.
