Assuming no transformer losses, the power in the 
secondary must equal the power in the primary. Al-
though the transformer can step up voltage, it cannot 
step up power. The power removed from the second-
ary can never be more than the power supplied to the 
primary. Therefore, when a transformer steps up the 
voltage, it steps down the current, so the output power 
remains the same. This can be expressed as
