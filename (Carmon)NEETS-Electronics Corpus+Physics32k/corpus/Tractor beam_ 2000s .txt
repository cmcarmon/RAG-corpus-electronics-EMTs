In 2001, Podkeltnov and Modanese reported the generation of a beam of gravity-like impulses. Their paper indicated a high voltage discharge device had been constructed that emitted a horizontal, collimated beam, with sharp borders, of short impulses of a repulsive force field that could penetrate different bodies without any noticeable loss of energy. Subsequently, the apparatus was dubbed an impulse gravity generator. Measurements of the impulses taken three to six meters beyond the emitter and in a building 150 meters away yielded identical results. Analyses of the measurements indicated the impulses briefly caused accelerations one thousand times the rate of gravity.
The gravity impulse generator received further theoretical support from David Maker and Glen A. Robertson, Gravi Atomic Research, Madison, Alabama and Wu. Chris Taylor, Jupiter Research Corporation, Houston, Texas, along with a private individual Robert Hendry and the original theorist Modanese conducted an analysis of the suitability of impulse gravity generators for Earth-to-orbit, interplanetary, and interstellar applications, this was repeated again in 2008 and a United States and European patent was received. In general, mainstream scientific community have treated the impulse gravity generator reports as extremely speculative and controversial. At least one other group based in central Europe has attempted to replicate Podkletnov's gravity impulse generator experiment, but they have elected not to publish their results.
