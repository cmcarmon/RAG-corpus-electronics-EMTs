Diffusion is a random walk process that can be quantified by the two key parameters: Δx, the step size, and Δt, the time interval when the walker takes a step. Thus, the diffusion coefficient is defined as D≡(Δx)2/(Δt).
When an ion is placed in a magnetic field, it will orbit the field lines while continuing to move along that line with whatever initial velocity it had. This produces a helical path through space. Since the axial velocities will have a range of values, often based on the Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics, this means the particles in the plasma will pass by others as they overtake them or are overtaken.
If one considers two such ions travelling along parallel axial paths, they can collide whenever their orbits intersect. In most geometries, this means there is a significant difference in the instantaneous velocities when the collide - one might be going "up" while the other would be going "down" in their helical paths. This causes the collisions to scatter the particles, making them random walks. Eventually, this process will cause any given ion to eventually leave the boundary of the field, and thereby escape "confinement".
In a uniform magnetic field, a particle undergoes random walk across the field lines by the step size of gyroradius ρ≡vth/Ω, where vth denotes the thermal velocity, and Ω≡qB/m, the gyrofrequency. The steps are randomized by the collisions to lose the coherence. Thus, the time step, or the decoherence time, is inverse of the collisional frequency νc. The rate of diffusion is given by νcρ2, with the rather favorable B−2 scaling law.
