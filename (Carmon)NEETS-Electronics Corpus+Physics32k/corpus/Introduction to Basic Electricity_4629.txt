Figure 45-30 shows a truth table for a comparator. 
The only time an output is desired is when both bits 
being compared are the same. The output column rep-
resents an exclusive OR with an inverter, also known 
as an exclusive NOR (XNOR) gate. An XNOR gate is 
essentially a comparator, because its output is a 1 only 
if the two inputs are the same. To compare numbers 
containing 2 bits or more, additional XNOR gates 
are necessary. Figure 45-31 shows a logic diagram of
