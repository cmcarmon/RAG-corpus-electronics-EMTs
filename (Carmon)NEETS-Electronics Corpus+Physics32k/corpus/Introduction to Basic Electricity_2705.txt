The impedance of a circuit containing both induc-
tance and resistance is the total opposition to current 
flow by both the inductor and the resistor. Because of 
the phase shift caused by the inductor, the inductive 
reactance and the resistance cannot be added directly. 
The impedance	(Z) is the vector sum of the induc-
tive reactance and the resistance in the circuit. The 
 impedance is expressed in ohms and is designated 
by the letter Z. Impedance can be defined in terms of 
Ohmâ€™s law as:
