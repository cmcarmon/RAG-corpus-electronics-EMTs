Figure 8.22 shows the plots of the times of the fault-tolerant
computations that use the hybrid checksum test and that use
only the ﬂoating point checksum test. The average overhead of
the hybrid checksum for matrix multiplication is 15%, whereas
for LU decomposition, the overhead is only 9.5%. Thus, the
signiﬁcantly higher error coverages yielded by the mantissa
