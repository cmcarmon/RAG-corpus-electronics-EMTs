Utilizing an "Ashby chart" is a common method for choosing the appropriate material. First, three different sets of variables are identified:
Material variables are the inherent properties of a material such as density, modulus, yield stress, and many others.
Free variables are quantities that can change during the loading cycle, for example, applied force.
Design variables are limits imposed on the design, such as how thick the beam can be or how much it can deflect
Next, an equation for the performance index is derived. This equation numerically quantifies how desirable the material will be for a specific situation. By convention, a higher performance index denotes a better material. Lastly, the performance index is plotted on the Ashby chart. Visual inspection reveals the most desirable material.
