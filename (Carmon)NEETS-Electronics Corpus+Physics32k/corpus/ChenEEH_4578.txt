j¼1 qj representing the dynamic change (a general
time-varying function depends on past system outputs, past
control inputs, and the current control input) caused by the
unknown and possibly unanticipated failure mode n for the l th
output. The F l
v are assumed unknown due to
the possible occurrence of unanticipated failures. The r is the
number of system failures. All the cases in which r > 1 are
referred to as multiple-failure cases. Two typical faults, incipient
faults and abrupt faults, are considered to be involved online.
Their characteristics can be described by the time-varying con-
stant gain, bl
