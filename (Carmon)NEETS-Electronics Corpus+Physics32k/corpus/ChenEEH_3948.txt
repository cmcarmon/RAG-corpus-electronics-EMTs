that limd!1 b ¼ 1.

detector is essentially a discrete-time matched ﬁlter.
This detector is also known as the correlation detector
as it correlates signal with the observation. When the
output of the detector is of a large numerical value, the
correlation between the observation and the signal is
high, and H1 is (likely to be) true.
