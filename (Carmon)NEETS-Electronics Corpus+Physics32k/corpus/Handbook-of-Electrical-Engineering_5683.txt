When  evaluating  the  impacts  of  the  above  severe  disturbances,  regional  planning  studies  should  consider
steady-state stability, transient stability, and dynamic stability. These studies should also consider the effects of
three-phase faults and slow fault clearing due to improper relaying or failure of a circuit breaker to open, as
well as the anticipated load range and various operating conditions.
