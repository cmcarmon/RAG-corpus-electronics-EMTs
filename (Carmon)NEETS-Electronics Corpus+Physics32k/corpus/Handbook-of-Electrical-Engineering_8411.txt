for any b3b2b1b0 code integer. Thus, decimal 6 is represented as (0 ·8) + (1 ·4) + (1 ·2) + (0 ·1), or 0110 in
NBCD  code.  Like  natural  binary,  NBCD  code  is  also  called “natural”  because  its  bit  positional  weights  are
derived from integer powers of 2n. Table 86.2 shows the NBCD bit patterns for decimal integers 0 through 9.
The NBCD code is currently the most widely used of the BCD codes. There are many excellent sources of
information  on  BCD  codes.  One,  in  particular,  provides  a  fairly  extensive  coverage  of  both  weighted  and
unweighted BCD codes [Tinder, 1991].
