The transmission of light along optical fibers depends not only on the nature of light, but also on the
structure of the optical fiber. Two methods are used to describe how light is transmitted along the optical
fiber. The first method, ray theory, uses the concepts of light reflection and refraction. The second
method, mode theory, treats light as electromagnetic waves. You must first understand the basic optical
properties of the materials used to make optical fibers. These properties affect how light is transmitted
through the fiber.
