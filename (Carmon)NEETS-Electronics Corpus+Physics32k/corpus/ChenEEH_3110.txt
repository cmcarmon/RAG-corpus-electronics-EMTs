To understand the rotor circuit, consider the concept of slip.
The application of a balanced three-phase supply to a three-
phase winding produces a rotating ﬂux distribution at syn-
chronous frequency vs. The rotor of the induction machine
will be rotating at frequency vm. The slip s can be deﬁned as:
