In aeronautics, the rate of climb (RoC) is an aircraft's vertical speed â€“ the rate of positive altitude change with respect to time or distance. In most ICAO member countries, even in otherwise metric countries, this is usually expressed in feet per minute (ft/min). Elsewhere, it is commonly expressed in metre per second (m/s). The rate of climb in an aircraft is indicated with a vertical speed indicator (VSI) or instantaneous vertical speed indicator (IVSI).
The rate of decrease in altitude is referred to as the rate of descent (RoD) or sink rate. A decrease in altitude corresponds with a negative rate of climb.
