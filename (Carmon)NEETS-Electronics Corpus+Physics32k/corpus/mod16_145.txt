Electronic measurements involve the fundamental electrical quantities of voltage and current and the
inherent characteristics of resistance, capacitance, and inductance. In circuits being tested, voltage and
current are dependent upon resistance, capacitance, and inductance for their distribution; therefore,
voltage and current measurements are valuable aids in determining circuit component conditions and in
the evaluation of symptoms. Practically any reading obtained from the use of test equipment will depend
on these basic measured quantities of resistance, capacitance, and inductance.
