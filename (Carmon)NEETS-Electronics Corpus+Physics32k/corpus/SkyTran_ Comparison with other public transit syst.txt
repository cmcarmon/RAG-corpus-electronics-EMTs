According to the US National Transit Database (record of every public transit system in the US), the average light rail system costs $5.66 per passenger ($1.78 for capital cost and $3.55 for operating cost). Light rail projects have cost $100 million per mile ($62,000,000/km) while skyTran would cost only $10 million per mile ($6,200,000/km). skytran infrastructure reduces the weight of empty vehicles to under 70 lb/ft (104 kg/m), compared with light rail vehicles weighing 990 lb/ft (1,473 kg/m).
Maximum capacity of the system is 11,500 passengers per hour per direction is reached by spacing vehicles at 1/2 second spacing. At 80 miles per hour (130 km/h), vehicles would be spaced at 59 feet (18 m) and stopped by multiple redundant safety systems. By automating control of the system, skyTran would be made safer than driving by eliminating human error (> 95% cause of human traffic fatalities). As lines reach capacity, a new line would be built parallel to the first 0.5 to one mile away to provide better coverage of the network.
