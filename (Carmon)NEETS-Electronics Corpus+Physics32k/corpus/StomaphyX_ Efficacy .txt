Early investigator-initiated uncontrolled clinical studies with small patient groups have demonstrated short-term weight loss in some patients. For example, a study of 27 patients found most achieved weight loss during the first six months after the procedure. However, a randomized sham-controlled study was terminated in 2011 because the device failed to achieve the study's 15% target reduction in body mass index (BMI) in 50% of patients treated with it.
