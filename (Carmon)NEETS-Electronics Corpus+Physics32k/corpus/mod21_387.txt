If you have no idea of the speed of the moving part, it is best to start the measurement procedure at 
the highest frequency that the stroboscope can deliver. The flashing rate of the stroboscope can then be 
gradually reduced until a single stationary image of the reference mark is obtained. This is the point of 
fundamental synchronism that corresponds to the speed of the moving part. Do not continue to reduce the 
flashing rate of the instrument beyond this point without a valid reason for doing so. If you do continue 
the reduction, a stationary image will still be observed, but the stroboscope will indicate a submultiple of 
the true rotational speed; thus, a measurement error will be introduced.
