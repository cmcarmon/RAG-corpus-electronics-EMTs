The final step in the process is calculating the 
 values of R1. The final calculation to determine the 
value of resistor R1 is based on the total current flow-
ing through junction A, 210 mA. Also the desired 
voltage at junction A is 6 volts. The source voltage is 
120 volts; therefore, resistor R1 must drop 120 V 2 6 V, 
or 114 V.
