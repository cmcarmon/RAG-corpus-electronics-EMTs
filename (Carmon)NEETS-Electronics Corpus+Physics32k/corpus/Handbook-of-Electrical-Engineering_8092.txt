(where 
c
 is the velocity of light) is very small, and conservation of momentum can be readily accommodated
by  small  deviations  from  the  vertical  transition  shown  in  Fig. 83.2(a).  For  the  indirect  case  illustrated  in
 deﬁnes the photon energy and momentum, again according to Eqs. (83.1)
Fig. 83.2(b), the energy change 
and (83.2), but conservation of momentum additionally requires that the much greater electron momentum
l
a
/2
h
,
 be accounted for. For lattice dimensions, 
on the order of 
m, it is clearly not possible for both conservation criteria to be met without the participation
on the order of 10
–6 
of a third body, i.e., a phonon. The two consequences of this result are that the indirect transition is inefﬁcient
(in that it must transfer momentum and hence thermal energy to the lattice) and less likely to occur than the
direct  transition  (because  of  the  requirement  for  all  three  particles  to  simultaneously  meet  the  energy  and
momentum conditions). Indirect bandgaps therefore lead to long diffusion lengths and recombination times,
which produce good transistors but poor LEDs.
