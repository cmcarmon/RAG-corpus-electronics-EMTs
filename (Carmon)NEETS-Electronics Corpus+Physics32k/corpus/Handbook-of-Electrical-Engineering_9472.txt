The hierarchical and network models require the application programmer to be aware of the internal structure
of the database. The relational model, on the other hand, allows for a high degree of physical and logical data
independence. Earlier DBMSs were for the most part navigational systems. Because of its simplicity and strong
theoretical foundations, the relational model has since received wide acceptance. Today, most DBMSs are based
on the relational model.
