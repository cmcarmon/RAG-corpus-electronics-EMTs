the nonzero clock skews
within the permissible range—no timing violations—is
illustrated in Figures 4.14(C) and 4.15(C). There is a
noticeable improvement because most clock skews are
concentrated around the center of the permissible range.
The majority of the clock skews are within 10% of the
safest clock skew value at the center of the respective
permissible range of each local data path.
