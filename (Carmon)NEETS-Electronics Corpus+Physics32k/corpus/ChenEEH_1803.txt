QoS-Based Routing
The best-effort Internet uses routing protocols such as Open
Shortest Path First (OSPF), Routing Information Protocol
(RIP), and Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) (Sun and Jain,
1999). These protocols are called best-effort routing protocols,
and they normally use single objective optimization algorithms
