While the relationship between human perception of sound and various attributes of the sound field is not yet well understood, DSP algorithms for sound localization are able to employ several mechanisms found in neural systems, including the interaural time difference (ITD, the difference in arrival time of a sound between two locations), the interaural intensity difference (IID, the difference in intensity of a sound between two locations), artificial pinnae, the precedence effect, and head-related transfer functions (HRTF) . When localizing 3D sound in spatial domain, one could take into account that the incoming sound signal could be reflected, defracted and scattered by the upper torso of the human which consists of shoulders, head and pinnae.Localization also depends on the direction of the sound source.
