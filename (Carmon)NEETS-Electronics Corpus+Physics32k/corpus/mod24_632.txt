for long-haul, very high-bandwidth communication systems. New semiconductor LEDs and LDs capable
of operating with single mode fibers at 1300 nm were developed to take advantage of single mode fiber's
very low value of dispersion. Additionally, LEDs and LDs operating at 1550 nm were developed to take
advantage of the fiber's lowest loss.
