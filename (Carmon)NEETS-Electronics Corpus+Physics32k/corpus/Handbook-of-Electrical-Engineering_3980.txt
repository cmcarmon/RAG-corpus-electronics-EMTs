Active devices that can supply gain at microwave frequencies can be fabricated from a variety of semiconductor
materials.  The  availability  of  such  devices  permits  a  wide  variety  of  system  components  to  be  designed  and
fabricated. Systems are generally constructed from components such as ﬁlters, ampliﬁers, oscillators, mixers,
phase shifters, switches, etc. Active devices are primarily required for the oscillator and ampliﬁer components.
For  these  functions,  devices  that  can  supply  current,  voltage,  or  power  gain  at  the  frequency  of  interest  are
embedded in circuits that are designed to provide the device with the proper environment to create the desired
response. The operation of the component is dictated, therefore, by both the capabilities of the active device
and its embedding circuit.
