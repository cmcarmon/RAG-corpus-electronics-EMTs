Suppose we are interested in sketching the voltage vC as a function of
time.4 The form of the response can be sketched intuitively by identifying three
intervals of operation as indicated in Figure 10.11d: the initial interval, which
extends until t = 0
(that is, the time instant just after t = 0), the transition
interval, which is identified as the interval after t = 0
, and the final interval,
where S2 has been closed and S1 has been open for a long time.
