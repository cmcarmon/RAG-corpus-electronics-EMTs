Today the two standard frequencies for the generation, transmission, and distribution of
electric power in the world are 60 Hz (in the United States, Canada, Japan, and Brazil) and 50 Hz
(in Europe, the former Soviet Republics, South America except Brazil, India, and also Japan).
Relatively speaking, the 60-Hz power-system apparatus is generally smaller in size and lighter
in weight than the corresponding 50-Hz equipment with the same ratings. On the other hand,
transmission lines and transformers have lower reactances at 50 Hz than at 60 Hz.
