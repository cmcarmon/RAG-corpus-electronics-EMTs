A circuit is deﬁned to have bounded input–bounded output (BIBO) stability if any bounded input results
in  a  bounded  output.  The  circuit  in  this  case  is  said  to  be  absolutely stable  or  unconditionally  stable.  BIBO
stability can be determined by examining the poles of the network function (6.14).
