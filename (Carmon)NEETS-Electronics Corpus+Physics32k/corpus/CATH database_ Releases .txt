The CATH team aim to provide official releases of the CATH classification every 12 months. This release process is important because is allows for the provision of internal validation, extra annotations and analysis. However, it can mean that there is a time delay between new structures appearing in the PDB and the latest official CATH release,
In order to address this issue: CATH-B provides a limited amount of information to the very latest domain annotations (e.g. domain boundaries and superfamily classifications).
The latest release of CATH-Gene3D (v4.1) was released in July 2016 and consists of:
308,999 structural protein domain entries
53,479,436 non-structural protein domain entries
2,737 homologous superfamily entries
92,882 functional family entries
