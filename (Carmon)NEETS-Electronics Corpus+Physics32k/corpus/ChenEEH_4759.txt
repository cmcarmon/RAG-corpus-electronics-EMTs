experiments in Levin and Katz (1984) to develop the analytical
model of equation 12.7. In Nayfeh et al. (1989), four angles of
attack are considered, at which the coefﬁcients a j
i are given. We
added three points to the table in Nayfeh et al. (1989) by
assuming that the functions passing through the points a j
i
are approximately piecewise linear (a reasonable assumption,
considering the plots presented in this publication). Thus, the
points used are given in Table 12.1, where the points at
v ¼ 17, 19 and 23.75 have been added to the table in question.
To build a smooth, time-varying model of the wing rock
that depends on the angle of attack v, we will consider the
interpolation functions:
