Other key properties of an injector include the fluid inlet pressure requirements i.e. whether it is lifting or non-lifting.
In a non-lifting injector, positive inlet fluid pressure is needed e.g. the cold water-input is fed by gravity.
The steam-cone minimal orifice diameter is kept larger than the combining cone minimal diameter. The non-lifting Nathan 4000 injector used on the Southern Pacific 4294 could push 12,000 US gallons (45,000 L) per hour at 250 psi (17 bar).
The lifting injector can operate with negative inlet fluid pressure i.e. fluid lying below the level of the injector. It differs from the non-lifting type mainly in the relative dimensions of the nozzles.
