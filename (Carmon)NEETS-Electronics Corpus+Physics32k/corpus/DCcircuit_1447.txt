So, the inductor in this circuit has a starting current of 5 amps and an ending current of
7.5 amps. Since the ”timing” will take place during the time that the switch is closed and R2
is shorted past, we need to calculate our time constant from L1 and R1: 1 Henry divided by 2
Ω, or τ = 1/2 second. With these values, we can calculate what will happen to the current over
time. The voltage across the inductor will be calculated by multiplying the current by 2 (to
arrive at the voltage across the 2 Ω resistor), then subtracting that from 15 volts to see what’s
left. If you realize that the voltage across the inductor starts at 5 volts (when the switch is
ﬁrst closed) and decays to 0 volts over time, you can also use these ﬁgures for starting/ending
values in the general formula and derive the same results:
