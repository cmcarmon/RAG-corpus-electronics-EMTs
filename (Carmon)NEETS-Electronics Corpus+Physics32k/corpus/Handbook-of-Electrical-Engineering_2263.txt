Usually amorphous semiconductors are not sensitive to the presence of impurity atoms, which saturate all
their chemical bonds in the ﬂexible network of the host atoms. (Compare this with a situation in crystalline
silicon  where  an  arsenic  impurity  can  form  only  four  chemical  bonds  with  the  host  lattice,  leaving  the  ﬁfth
responsible for the formation of the donor state.) Consequently, the doping of amorphous semiconductors is
difﬁcult to accomplish. However, in hydrogenated a-Si (which can be prepared by the glow discharge decom-
position of silane), the density of the localized states is considerably reduced and the conductivity of this material
can be controlled by doping. As in crystalline semiconductors, the charge carrier concentration in hydrogenated
