Note that there are three types of scales on this meter face: a green scale for resistance at
the top, a set of black scales for DC voltage and current in the middle, and a set of blue scales
for AC voltage and current at the bottom. Both the DC and AC scales have three sub-scales,
one ranging 0 to 2.5, one ranging 0 to 5, and one ranging 0 to 10. The meter operator must
choose whichever scale best matches the range switch and plug settings in order to properly
interpret the meterâ€™s indication.
