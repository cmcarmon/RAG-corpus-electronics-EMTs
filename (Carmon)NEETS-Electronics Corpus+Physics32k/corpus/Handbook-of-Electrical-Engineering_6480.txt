Lightwave  technology
  has  revolutionized  the  transmission  of  analog  and,  in  particular,  video  information.
Because the light output intensity from a semiconductor laser is linearly proportional to the injected current,
and the current generated in a photodetector is linearly proportional to the incident optical intensity, analog
linear
information is transmitted as modulation of the optical intensity. The lightwave system is analogous to a 
electrical  link,  where  current  or  voltage  translates  linearly  into  optical  intensity.  High-speed  semiconductor
lasers and photodetectors enable intensity-modulation bandwidths greater than 10 GHz. Hence, a wide variety
of radio frequency (RF) and microwave applications have been developed [Darcie, 1990].
