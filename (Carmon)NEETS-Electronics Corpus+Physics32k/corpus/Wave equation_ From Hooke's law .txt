The wave equation in the one-dimensional case can be derived from Hooke's Law in the following way: Imagine an array of little weights of mass m interconnected with massless springs of length h . The springs have a spring constant of k:

Here the dependent variable u(x) measures the distance from the equilibrium of the mass situated at x, so that u(x) essentially measures the magnitude of a disturbance (i.e. strain) that is traveling in an elastic material. The forces exerted on the mass m at the location x+h are:

The equation of motion for the weight at the location x+h is given by equating these two forces:

{\displaystyle {\partial ^{2} \over \partial t^{2}}u(x+h,t)={k \over m}[u(x+2h,t)-u(x+h,t)-u(x+h,t)+u(x,t)]}

where the time-dependence of u(x) has been made explicit.
If the array of weights consists of N weights spaced evenly over the length L = Nh of total mass M = Nm, and the total spring constant of the array K = k/N we can write the above equation as:

{\displaystyle {\partial ^{2} \over \partial t^{2}}u(x+h,t)={KL^{2} \over M}{u(x+2h,t)-2u(x+h,t)+u(x,t) \over h^{2}}}

Taking the limit N → ∞, h → 0 and assuming smoothness one gets:

{\displaystyle {\partial ^{2}u(x,t) \over \partial t^{2}}={KL^{2} \over M}{\partial ^{2}u(x,t) \over \partial x^{2}}}

which is from the definition of a second derivative. (KL2)/M is the square of the propagation speed in this particular case.
