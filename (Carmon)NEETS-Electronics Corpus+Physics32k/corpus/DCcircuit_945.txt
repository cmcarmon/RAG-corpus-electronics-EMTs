So what can we do when we’re faced with multiple unknowns in a circuit? The answer
is initially found in a mathematical process known as simultaneous equations or systems of
equations, whereby multiple unknown variables are solved by relating them to each other in
multiple equations. In a scenario with only one unknown (such as every Ohm’s Law equation
we’ve dealt with thus far), there only needs to be a single equation to solve for the single
unknown:
