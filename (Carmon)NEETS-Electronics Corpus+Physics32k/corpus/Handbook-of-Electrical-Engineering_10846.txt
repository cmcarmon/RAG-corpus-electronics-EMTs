In this chapter, we explore the state-of-the-art in CACSD. We begin with a brief survey of the tools that have
been developed over the years. We then focus on the matrix environments that provide the current standard
and attempt to explain why they are important. We also examine modern block-diagram editors, simulation
and code generation tools, and Ô¨Ånally allow ourselves to speculate on the future.
