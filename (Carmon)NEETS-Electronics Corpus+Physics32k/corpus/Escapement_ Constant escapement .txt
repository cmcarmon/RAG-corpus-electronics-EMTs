Based on the principles of patents initially submitted by Rolex on behalf of inventor Nicolas Déhon, the constant escapement was developed by Girard-Perregaux as working prototypes in 2008 (Nicolas Déhon was then head of Girard-Perregaux R&D department) and in watches by 2013.
The key component of this escapement is a silicon buckled-blade which acts a micro-accumulator of energy. This blade is flexed to a point as close as possible to its unstable state, and only needs an infinitesimal quantity of energy – a micro-impulse given by the balance wheel – for it to snap from one S-curve state to its mirror image, and in the process, to push the balance wheel forward.
This snap being always the same, it is liberating the same quantity of energy every time and compensating for the variable energy of the barrel. The role of the micro-accumulator enables it to compensate for the variable energy of the barrel by releasing the same amount of energy each time. Contrary to certain mechanisms such as remontoirs in which the constant force is supplied over an average, this is an authentic constant-force escapement, as the latter is indeed instantaneous and continuous.
