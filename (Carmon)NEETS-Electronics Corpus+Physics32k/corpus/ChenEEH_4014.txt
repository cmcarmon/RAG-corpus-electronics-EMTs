. A multigrain conﬁgurable cell, such as Pleiades (Zhang
et al., 2000; Rabaey et al., 1997; Abnovs and Rabaey, 1996;
Wan et al., 1999), is a multigrain heterogeneous system
partitioned by control-ﬂow computing on microproces-
sor and data ﬂow computing on RC for future wireless
embedded devices. An RC array is composed of satellite
(conﬁgurable) processors and a programmable intercon-
nection to the main microprocessor. Data-ﬂow comput-
ing is implemented using global asynchronous and local
synchronous clocking to reduce overhead. Therefore, op-
eration starts only when all input data are ready.
