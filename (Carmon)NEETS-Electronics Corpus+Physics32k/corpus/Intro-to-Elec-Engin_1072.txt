where k1 and k2 are constants. Neglecting the
winding resistances, derive an expression for the
electric force when both windings are connected
to the same voltage source v = Vm sin ωt.
Comment on its dependence on x.
12.4.11 Two mutually coupled coils are shown in Figure
P12.4.11. The inductances of the coils are L11 =
A, L22 = B, and L12 = L21 = C cos θ. Find the
electric torque for:
(a) i1 = I0, i2 = 0.
(b) i1 = i2 = I0.
(c) i1 = Im sin ωt, i2 = I0.
(d) i1 = i2 = Im sin ωt.
(e) Coil 1 short-circuited and i2 = I0.
