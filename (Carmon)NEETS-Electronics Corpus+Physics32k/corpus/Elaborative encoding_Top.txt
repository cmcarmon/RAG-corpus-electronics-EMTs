Elaborative encoding is a mnemonic that relates to-be-remembered information to pre-existing memories and knowledge. One can make such connections visually, spatially, semantically or acoustically. Practitioners use multiple techniques, such as the method of loci, the link system, the peg-word method, PAO (person, action, object), etc., to store information in long-term memory and to make it easier to recall this information in the future. Mnemonists at the World Memory Championships use many different forms and techniques of elaborative encoding - in addition to the ones listed above - to remember large quantities of information pertaining to each event of the competition. Each year, competitors invent new techniques and improve previous ones that allow them to remember larger quantities of information faster, so competitors must train year-round to keep pace with the newest techniques and tricks of elaborative encoding.
