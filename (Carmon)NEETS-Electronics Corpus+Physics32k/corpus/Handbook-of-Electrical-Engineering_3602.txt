The high-frequency or microwave-frequency electromagnetic ﬁeld concepts are helpful in studying the micro-
wave devices as discussed in Chapter 39. The electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) study in the following chapter
is important for proper functioning of microwave devices and circuits. The important application of electro-
magnetic radiation in the form of radar, discussed in Chapter 41, is useful not only for defense but in remote
sensing and weather forecasting also. The next chapter explains the propagation of light through waveguides and
optical ﬁbers/cables. Optical ﬁber technology is an emerging technology and is affecting every facet of human
life.  Microwave  circuits  are  the  practical  realization  of  electromagnetic  ﬁeld  concepts  and  are  discussed  in
Chapter 42. With  the  arrival  of  sophisticated  software  packages  and  high-speed  computers,  now  it  is  possible
and worthwhile to do 3-D analysis and computer modeling of electromagnetic ﬁelds in the circuits or devices,
as discussed in the last two chapters of this section. This is helpful in the accurate design of microwave components
and circuits. All the topics mentioned in this introduction are discussed in detail in their respective chapters.
