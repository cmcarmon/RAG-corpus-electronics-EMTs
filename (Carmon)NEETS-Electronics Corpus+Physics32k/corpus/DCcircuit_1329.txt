Just as in the case of automobile steering systems, hysteresis can be a problem. If you’re
designing a system to produce precise amounts of magnetic ﬁeld ﬂux for given amounts of
current, hysteresis may hinder this design goal (due to the fact that the amount of ﬂux density
would depend on the current and how strongly it was magnetized before!). Similarly, a loose
steering system is unacceptable in a race car, where precise, repeatable steering response is
a necessity. Also, having to overcome prior magnetization in an electromagnet can be a waste
of energy if the current used to energize the coil is alternating back and forth (AC). The area
within the hysteresis curve gives a rough estimate of the amount of this wasted energy.
