Because there is no well-defined "center of mass" in curved spacetime, general relativity allows a stationary object to, in a sense, "change its position" in a counter-intuitive manner, without violating conservation of momentum.
The Alcubierre drive is a hypothetical method of apparent faster-than-light propulsion for interstellar travel postulated from the theory of general relativity. Although this concept may be allowed by the currently accepted laws of physics, it remains unproven; implementation would require a negative energy density, and possibly a better understanding of quantum gravity. It is not clear how (or if) this effect could provide a useful means of accelerating an actual space vehicle and no practical designs have been proposed, but experiments are underway at NASA's Eagleworks Laboratories to attempt the first detection of an induced spacetime curvature, which could be the first step toward proving the validity of the concept.
A hypothetical "impulse engine" or "distortion engine" creating a gravitational potential in spacetime, with no negative energy source contrary to the Alcubierre drive, would also produce a reactionless motion, being a low velocity (non relativistic) warp drive.
Some bimetric theories of gravity with variable speed of light like the Janus cosmological model hypothesize apparent faster-than-light interstellar travel with no acceleration nor deceleration, using the energy difference of the two conjugated metrics to reach relativistic speeds after a mass inversion process.
“Swimming in spacetime” is a geometrical motive principle that exploits the curved spacetime metric of the gravitational field to permit an extended body undergoing specific deformations in shape, to change position. In weak gravitational fields, like that of Earth, the change in position per deformation cycle would be far too small to detect, but the concept remains of interest as the only unambiguous example of reactionless motion in mainstream physics.
