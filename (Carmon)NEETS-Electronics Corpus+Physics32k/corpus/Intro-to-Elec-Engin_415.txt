where A0fh is the open-loop gain–bandwidth product, fH is the closed-loop bandwidth, and G0 is
the closed-loop gain. The term closed loop signiﬁes circuit performance when a path exists from
output to input, whereas open loop implies the inherent characteristics of the op amp. Thus, for
an op amp whose gain bandwidth product is 1 MHz with A0 = 105 and fh = 10 Hz, a stage
with a closed-loop gain of 10 has a bandwidth fH = 100 kHz, as shown in the asymptotic Bode
diagram of Figure 5.2.4.
