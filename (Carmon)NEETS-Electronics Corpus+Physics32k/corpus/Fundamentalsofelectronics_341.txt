Solution to Exercise 3.8 (p. 42)
In a series combination of resistors, the current is the same in each; in a parallel combination, the voltage
is the same. For a series combination, the equivalent resistance is the sum of the resistances, which will be
larger than any component resistor’s value; for a parallel combination, the equivalent conductance is the sum
of the component conductances, which is larger than any component conductance. The equivalent resistance
is therefore smaller than any component resistance.
