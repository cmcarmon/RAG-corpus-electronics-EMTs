Polypropylene has a structure related to that of ethylene with one added methyl group. It is a thermoplastic
material having properties similar to high-density PE, though due to its lower density it has also a lower dielectric
constant. It has many electrical applications both in bulk form as in molded and extruded insulations as well
as in Ô¨Ålm form in taped capacitor, transformer, and cable insulations.
