These conditional pdfs are shown in Figure 3.2. The right-
most conditional pdf p(zjs1), shows the probability density of
the detector output, z(T ), given that s1(t) was transmitted.
Similarly, the leftmost conditional pdf p(zjs2), shows the
probability density of the detector output z(T ), given s2(t)
was transmitted.
