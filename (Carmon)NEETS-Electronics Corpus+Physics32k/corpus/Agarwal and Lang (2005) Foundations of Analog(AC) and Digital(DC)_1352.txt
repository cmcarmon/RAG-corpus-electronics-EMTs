The capacitor is disconnected from the charging source so that its stored charge remains
constant. Following that, its plates are pulled apart so as to double the distance between
them; that is, the gap separation is now 2l. For this new configuration, determine the
voltage across the terminals of the capacitor and the energy stored in the capacitor.
Explain how the stored energy changes.

Figure 9.69 shows two capacitive two-port networks. One is a
‘‘’’ network, and one is a ‘‘T’’ network. For the  network, find i1P and i2P as functions
of v1P and v2P. For the T network, find i1T and i2T as functions of v1T and v2T.
