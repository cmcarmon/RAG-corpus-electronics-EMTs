This chapter introduces the switch circuit element and demonstrates how
digital logic gates can be constructed using switches and other primitive circuit
elements we have seen previously. This chapter also discusses a common imple-
mentation of the switch in VLSI technology using a device called a MOSFET
(Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor).
