a charge on the wall that reduces the voltage across the gas. After a short time, the discharge will extinguish
and the light output will end until the applied voltage reverses polarity and a new discharge pulse occurs. This
wall charge allows the ac plasma displays to operate in a memory mode, which greatly increases the brightness
of large displays.
