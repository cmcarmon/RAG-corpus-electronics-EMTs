It is a seldom-known fact that the Fluke 893 ac-dc differential voltmeter can be used for measuring
extremely high resistances from 10 megohms to 106 megohms with a typical accuracy of â€“ 5%. This
measurement method, however, requires some basic calculations on your part. The obvious advantage of
the differential voltmeter is its capability of measuring extremely high resistances. Consult the Fluke 893
technical manual for initial switch settings and a more detailed explanation of its operation.
