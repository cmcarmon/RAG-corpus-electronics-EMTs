This circuit, as all others, has some resistance. Even the relatively small resistance of the coil and the 
connecting wires cause energy to be dissipated in the form of heat (I2R loss). The heat loss in the circuit 
resistance causes the charge on the capacitor to be less for each subsequent cycle. The result is a 
DAMPED WAVE, as shown in figure 1-9. The charging and discharging action will continue until all of 
the energy has been radiated or dissipated as heat.
