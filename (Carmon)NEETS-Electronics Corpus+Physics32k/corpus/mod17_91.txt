The MEDIUM-FREQUENCY (mf) band of the radio-frequency spectrum includes the international 
distress frequencies (500 kilohertz and approximately 484 kilohertz). Some ships have mf equipment. If 
desired the distress frequencies may be monitored. When this is done the transmitter usually is kept in the 
standby position. Ashore, the mf receiver and transmitter equipment configuration is usually affiliated 
with search and rescue organizations, which are generally located near the coast.
