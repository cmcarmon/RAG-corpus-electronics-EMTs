The Sun VIS extension also uses the ﬂoating-point registers. The MAX-2 extension  is the latest extension
to the HP architecture. It uses integer registers rather than ﬂoating-point registers. It does not directly implement
multiplication, but instead provides a shift-and-add operation for software-driven multiplication. MAX-2 also
supports a permutation operation to allow subwords to be rearranged in a word.
