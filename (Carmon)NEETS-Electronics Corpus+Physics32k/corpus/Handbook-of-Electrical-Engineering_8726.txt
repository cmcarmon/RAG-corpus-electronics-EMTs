The notion of abstraction is very important to understanding what a HLL is. The example above illustrates
a  simple  abstraction,  e.g.,  that  of  data  structure  abstraction,  but  other  HLLs  employ  much  more  powerful
abstraction mechanisms. In fact, the level of abstraction of a HLL deﬁnes how high a HLL is. But, how do we
measure the level of a HLL? What constitutes a HLL’s height?
