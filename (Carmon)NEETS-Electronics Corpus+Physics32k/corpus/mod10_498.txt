At this point, the same process takes place with the next to the last inductor and capacitor. When the
magnetic field about the inductor collapses, current continues to flow into the next to the last capacitor,
charging it to E volts. This action continues backward down the line until the first capacitor has been fully
charged to the applied voltage. This change of voltage, moving backward down the line, can be thought of
in the following manner. The voltage, arriving at the end of the line, finds no place to go and returns to
the sending end with the same polarity (view C). Such action is called REFLECTION.
