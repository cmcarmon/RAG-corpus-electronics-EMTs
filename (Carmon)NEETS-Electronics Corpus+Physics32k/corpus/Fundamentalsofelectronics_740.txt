Consequently, most wireline channels today essentially consist of pairs of conducting wires (see Figure 6.1),
and the transmitter applies a message-related voltage across the pair. How these pairs of wires are physically
conﬁgured greatly aﬀects their transmission characteristics. One example is twisted pair, wherein the wires
