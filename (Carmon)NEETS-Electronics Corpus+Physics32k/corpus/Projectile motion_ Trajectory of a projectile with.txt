In this section we will take air resistance to be in direct proportion to the velocity of the particle (i.e.




F

a


∝



v
→





{\displaystyle F_{a}\propto {\vec {v}}}
). This is only valid at Reynolds number below about 1000. In air, which has a kinematic viscosity around 0.15 cm2/s this means that the product of speed and diameter must be less than about 150 cm2/s which is obviously not usually the case. We do this though so that the equations describing the particle's motion are easily solved. At higher values of speed times diameter (high Reynolds number) the force of air resistance is proportional to the square of the particle's velocity (see drag equation). Here,




v

0




{\displaystyle v_{0}}
,




v

x




{\displaystyle v_{x}}
and




v

y




{\displaystyle v_{y}}
will be used to denote the initial velocity, the velocity along the direction of x and the velocity along the direction of y, respectively. The mass of the projectile will be denoted by m. For the derivation only the case where




0

o


≤
θ
≤

180

o




{\displaystyle 0^{o}\leq \theta \leq 180^{o}}
is considered. Again, the projectile is fired from the origin (0,0).

The free body diagram on the right is for a projectile that experiences air resistance and the effects of gravity. Here, air resistance is assumed to be in the direction opposite of the projectile's velocity.

(actually

{\displaystyle F_{air}=-kv^{2}}
is more realistic, but not used here, to ensure an analytic solution,) is written due to the initial assumption of direct proportionality implies that the air resistance and the velocity differ only by a constant arbitrary factor with units of N*s/m.
The relationships that represent the motion of the particle are derived by Newton's Second Law, both in the x and y directions. In the x direction

{\displaystyle v_{x}=v_{xo}}

While (1) is solved much in the same way, (2) is of distinct interest because of its non-homogeneous nature. Hence, we will be extensively solving (2). Note that in this case the initial conditions are used

An example is given using values for the mass and terminal velocity for a baseball taken from [1].

However, this takes advantage of the fact that horizontally, acceleration is always negative. As acceleration is negative while velocity is positive and positive while velocity is negative, a projectile fired upwards requires the absolute value to be taken of the vertical velocity, which makes an analytical solution for vertical position more complex.
