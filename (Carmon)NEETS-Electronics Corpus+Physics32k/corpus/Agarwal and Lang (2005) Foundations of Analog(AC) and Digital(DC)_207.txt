A similar model might apply for a microphone. When an information
processing system such as an amplifier is connected to the microphone,
its
output might drop from a 1-mV peak-to-peak signal to a 0.5-mV peak-to-peak
signal due to the internal resistance of the microphone. As with the battery, we
can model the microphone as a voltage source in series with a resistance Rm as
depicted in Figure 1.39. Although the output voltage of the microphone will
not run down over time, its model is not exact for other reasons. For example,
the voltage drop in the signal might be related to the signal frequency.
