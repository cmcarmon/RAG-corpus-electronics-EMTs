Mesh  analysis  provides  another  general  procedure  for  analyzing  cir-
cuits, using mesh currents as the circuit variables. Using mesh currents
instead  of  element  currents  as  circuit  variables  is  convenient  and
reduces  the  number  of  equations  that  must  be  solved  simultaneously.
Recall that a loop is a closed path with no node passed more than once.
A mesh is a loop that does not contain any other loop within it.
