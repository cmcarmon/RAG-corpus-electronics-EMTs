The common base stage is often used to broadband the common emitter ampliﬁer by forming the common
emitter–common base cascode, whose ac schematic diagram is given in Fig. 28.17. The broadbanding afforded
by the cascode structure stems from the fact that the effective low frequency load resistance, say RLe, seen by
the common emitter transistor, QE, is the small driving point input resistance of the common base ampliﬁer,
QB. This effective load resistance, as witnessed by Cm of the common emitter transistor, is much smaller than
the  actual  load  resistance  that  terminates  the  output  port  of  the  ampliﬁer,  thereby  decreasing  the  Miller
multiplication of the Cm in QE. If the time constant savings afforded by decreased Miller multiplication is larger
than  the  sum  of  the  additional  time  constants  presented  to  the  circuit  by  the  common  base  transistor,  an
enhancement of common emitter bandwidth occurs. Note that such bandwidth enhancement is realized without
compromising  the  common  emitter  gain-bandwidth  product,  since  the  voltage  gain  of  the  common  emit-
ter–common base unit is almost identical to that of the common emitter ampliﬁer alone.
