From Equation 9.50 we can now begin to see the reason for the inverter behavior
observed in Figure 9.3. It will take time for the gate current to transport charge
onto the gate, and hence it will take time for the gate voltage to rise. Thus, it
will take time for the inverter to pass a signal from its input to its output. We
will have more to say about this in Section 10.4.
