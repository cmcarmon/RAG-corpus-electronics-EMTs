By looking at Figure 4.16(A), we note that by taking a pixel,
for example, at the girl’s face, the pixels around it have on
average similar values. Certainly there are pixels for which this
does not hold, such as at the boundary of the girl’s skin and
hair. However, this is true of most of the image’s pixels.
Examining the images in Figures 4.16(B) and 4.16(C), we see
that the same reasoning applies to them. In other words, if we
know something about one pixel, it is likely that we can guess,
with a good probability of success, many things about the
pixels around it. This implies that we do not need all the pixels
to represent the images, only the ones carrying information
that cannot be guessed.
