Capacitors C2 and C3 can be GANGED (mechanically linked together) to simplify tuning. Capacitor 
C1 is used to tune (resonate) the antenna to the transmitter frequency. CA is the effective capacitance 
existing between the antenna and ground. This antenna-to-ground capacitance is in parallel with the 
tuning capacitors, C2 and C3. Since the antenna has capacitance, any change in its length or position, 
such as that caused by swaying of the antenna, changes the value of CA and causes the oscillator to 
change frequency. Because these frequency changes are undesirable for reliable communications, the 
multistage transmitter was developed to increase reliability.
