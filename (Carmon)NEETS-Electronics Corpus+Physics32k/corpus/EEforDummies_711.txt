SMT packaging has become so widely adopted that it is often difficult to find 
certain ICs sold in a DIP package. If you want to use a surface‐mount IC in a 
solderless breadboard (because you may not be able to find the DIP variety), 
look for special DIP adapter modules that convert various surface‐mount 
IC packages to pin‐compatible DIP packages you can plug directly into your 
breadboard. (Enter “DIP adapter” into your favorite Internet search engine to 
get a list of suppliers of such devices.)
