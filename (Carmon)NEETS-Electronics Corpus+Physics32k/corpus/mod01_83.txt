When the atom loses electrons or gains electrons in this process of electron exchange, it is said to be
IONIZED. For ionization to take place, there must be a transfer of energy which results in a change in the
internal energy of the atom. An atom having more than its normal amount of electrons acquires a negative
charge, and is called a NEGATIVE ION. The atom that gives up some of its normal electrons is left with
less negative charges than positive charges and is called a POSITIVE ION. Thus, ionization is the process
by which an atom loses or gains electrons.
