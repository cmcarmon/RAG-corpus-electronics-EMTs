If you add a light bulb to your capacitor circuit powered by an AC volt-
age source, the bulb will light and will stay lit as long as the AC source is 
connected. Current alternates its direction through the bulb, but the bulb 
doesnâ€™t care which way current flows through it. (Not so for an LED, which 
cares very much which way current flows.) Although no current ever passes 
through the capacitor, the charging/discharging action of the capacitor cre-
ates the effect of current flowing back and forth through the circuit.
