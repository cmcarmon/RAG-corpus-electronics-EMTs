In the second level, the sequences of words consisting of phrases or sentences are analyzed for grammar and
syntax.  This  analysis  provides  information  to  another  set  of  rules  which  determine  the  stress,  duration,  and
pitch  to  be  added  to  the  phonemic  representation.  This  level  of  processing  may  also  alter  the  phonemic
representation of individual words to account for coarticulation effects. Finally, the sequences of parameters
which specify the pronunciation are smoothed in an attempt to mimic the smooth movements of the human
articulators (lips, jaw, velum, and tongue).
