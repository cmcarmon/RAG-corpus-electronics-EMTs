In frequency modulation, the instantaneous frequency of the radio-frequency wave is varied in
accordance with the modulating signal, as shown in view (A) of figure 2-5. As mentioned earlier, the
amplitude is kept constant. This results in oscillations similar to those illustrated in view (B). The number
