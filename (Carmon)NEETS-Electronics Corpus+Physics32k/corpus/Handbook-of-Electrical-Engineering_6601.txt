Active Star Networks: Ethernet, DatakitÂ®
Carrier  sense  multiple  access  with  collision  detection  (CSMA/CD)  Ethernet  networks  operating  at  10  Mb/s
connect users on a copper bus. The length of the bus must be less than 1/2 the distance light propagates in the
time required to transmit a packet frame. Thus, for speeds much greater than 10 Mb/s, where optics might be
needed, the length of the bus will be limited unless the maximum frame contains an impractically large number
of  bits.  Further,  the  number  of  stations  that  can  be  supported  by  an  optical  bus  is  limited  by  the  nature  of
optical taps, as opposed to electrical taps [Kaminow, 1989]. Finally, the collision detection algorithm does not
work  well  on  an  optical  bus  because  the  intensities  of  optical  packets  from  two  different  stations  may  vary
considerably along the bus. Thus, an active electronic star, as shown in Fig. 71.9, with optical data links from
users is often employed.
