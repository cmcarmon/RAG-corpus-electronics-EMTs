You’ll find kits for light‐sensitive alarms, simulated traffic signals, electronic 
combination locks, adjustable timers, decorative light displays, and much 
more. Many of the parts sources mentioned in Chapter 19 provide ready‐
made kits at reasonable prices. You can practice your circuit‐building and 
analysis skills using these kits, and then move on to designing, building, and 
testing your own circuits from scratch.
