important in the design of gait analysis and prostheses. For
example, in gait analysis, is the angle between the hip and
femur on the opposite side of the body important for proper
ankle movement? Is the angle on the same side important?
These questions can be answered by taking multiple measure-
ments and solving for dependent and independent variables.
Tissue engineering can involve the interaction of materials
(e.g., implants, lasers, etc.) with tissues of the body, such as
implants using feedback to identify the amount of sugar in the
blood for diabetics. The application of control theory to quan-
tum systems,
lasing without
inversion, NMR spectroscopy, and quantum information
systems, has become of great interest in recent years. Medical
image analysis can be highly dependent on fundamental alge-
braic concepts and system theoretic techniques, and bilinear
models are widely used for nonlinear biomedical signal and
image processing. In medical technology development, the
microelectromechanical and nanoelectromechanical phenom-
ena and processes produce new challenges for the control
engineer. For noninvasive data systems, such as multisensorial
electrophysiology and biomagnetism, sensor array analysis
depends on advanced algebraic techniques.
