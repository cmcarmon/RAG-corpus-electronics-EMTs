The return over a single period of any length of time is:

{\displaystyle r={\frac {V_{f}-V_{i}}{V_{i}}}}

where:

{\displaystyle V_{f}}
= final value, including dividends and interest

{\displaystyle V_{i}}
= initial value
For example, if you hold 100 shares, with a starting price of 10, then the starting value is 100 x 10 = 1,000. If you then collect 0.50 per share in cash dividends, and the ending share price is 9.80, then at the end you have 100 x 0.50 = 50 in cash, plus 100 x 9.80 = 980 in shares, totalling a final value of 1,030. The change in value is 1,030 - 1,000 = 30, so the return is 30 / 1,000 = 3%.
