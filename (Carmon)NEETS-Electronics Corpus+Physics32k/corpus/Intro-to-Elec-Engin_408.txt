The operational ampliﬁer, known also as op amp, consists of several transistors, diodes, capacitors,
and resistors. It is available in integrated-circuit form for less than one U.S. dollar. Being
inexpensive, compact, and versatile, operational ampliﬁers are used in a variety of simple circuits.
Op-amp circuits, as we will see later, usually contain negative feedback.
