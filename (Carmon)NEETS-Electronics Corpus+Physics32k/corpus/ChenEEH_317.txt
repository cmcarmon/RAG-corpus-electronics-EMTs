voltage is needed to achieve the onset of inversion resulting in
an increase of the threshold voltage. In addition, the doping
concentration and oxide thickness can also have an impact on
the threshold voltage dependence on back bias. Lower doping
concentrations and thinner oxides result in a weaker depend-
ence of back bias on threshold voltage.
