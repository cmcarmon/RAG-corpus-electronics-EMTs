Mass can be written in terms of the average mass density



ρ
(
r
)


{\displaystyle \rho (r)}
inside a sphere of radius



r


{\displaystyle r}
by the expression




M
=



4
π
ρ
(
r

3




{\displaystyle M={4\pi \rho (r)r^{3} \over 3}}
.
The field equation becomes




R
=

ρ
(
r
)


{\displaystyle R={4\pi G \over {3}}\rho (r)}
.
The curvature of the particle trajectories is proportional to mass density.
