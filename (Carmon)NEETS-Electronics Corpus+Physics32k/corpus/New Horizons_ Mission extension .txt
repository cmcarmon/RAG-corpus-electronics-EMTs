The New Horizons team requested, and received, a mission extension through 2021 to explore additional Kuiper belt objects (KBOs). During this Kuiper Belt Extended Mission (KEM), the spacecraft will perform a close fly-by of (486958) 2014 MU69 and conduct more distant observations on an additional two dozen objects.
