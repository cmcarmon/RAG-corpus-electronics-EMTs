In Si, however, the lowest minimum point of the conduction
band is quite anisotropic. In this case, the simplest equation
for E(k) is obtained by expressing k in terms of two compon-
ents: kl and kt , which is perpendicular to kl. These components
are called longitudinal and transverse components of k, re-
spectively. (This takes into account the crystal symmetry,
which makes all possible directions of kt equivalent.) Now
the inverse effective mass tensor reduces to two components:
1=ml and 1=mt , where ml and mt are called the longitudinal
effective mass and transverse effective mass, respectively. In
this case, the equation for E(k) is given by:
