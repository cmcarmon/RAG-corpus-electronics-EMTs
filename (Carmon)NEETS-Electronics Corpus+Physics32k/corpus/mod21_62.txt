Voltage measurements are most easily made when the deflection of the trace extends across the
major portion of the oscilloscope screen; whenever possible, the trace should cover at least 60% of the
vertical viewing area of the screen. If the amplitude of the measured voltage is very low, the trace
dimensions may be small. If a voltage to be measured is large and cannot be attenuated to a usable value
by attenuation circuits within the oscilloscope, an external resistive or capacitive voltage divider can be
used. Such voltage dividers are often furnished with oscilloscope test sets and are called HIGH
VOLTAGE PROBES. When the voltage of pulses or other complete waveforms is being measured, the
high voltage probe selected must be so designed as not to distort the measured signal. Most probes have
adjustable (compensating) capacitors that are used to adjust the symmetry of the displayed waveform.
You adjust the probe by monitoring either the calibrator output of the oscilloscope or a known good
signal and adjusting the probe for a symmetrical display. Oscilloscopes are calibrated to display peak-to-
peak values. To determine the rms voltage of a sinusoidal signal, divide the number of graticule units
from the positive to the negative peaks by two and multiply this value by 0.707. When using the
oscilloscope for ac voltage measurements, ensure the upper frequency range of the oscilloscope is not
exceeded; otherwise, inaccurate values will be displayed. Most commonly used oscilloscopes have a
frequency response from dc up to 100 megahertz.
