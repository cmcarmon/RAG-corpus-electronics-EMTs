Now we have an equation that, as we propagate it forward in time and adjust




E

0




{\displaystyle E_{0}}
appropriately, we find the ground state of any given Hamiltonian. This is still a harder problem than classical mechanics, though, because instead of propagating single positions of particles, we must propagate entire functions. In classical mechanics, we could simulate the motion of the particles by setting



x
(
t
+
τ
)
=
x
(
t
)
+
τ
v
(
t
)
+
0.5
F
(
t
)

τ

2




{\displaystyle x(t+\tau )=x(t)+\tau v(t)+0.5F(t)\tau ^{2}}
, if we assume that the force is constant over the time span of



τ


{\displaystyle \tau }
. For the imaginary time Schrödinger equation, instead, we propagate forward in time using a convolution integral with a special function called a Green's function. So we get



Ψ
(
x
,
t
+
τ
)
=
∫
G
(
x

x

τ
)
Ψ
(

x

,
t
)
d

x
′



{\displaystyle \Psi (x,t+\tau )=\int G(x,x',\tau )\Psi (x',t)dx'}
. Similarly to classical mechanics, we can only propagate for small slices of time; otherwise the Green's function is inaccurate. As the number of particles increases, the dimensionality of the integral increases as well, since we have to integrate over all coordinates of all particles. We can do these integrals by Monte Carlo integration.
