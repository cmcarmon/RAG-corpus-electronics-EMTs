There are simple procedures to determine VTH, IN, ZN, and ZTH for a given circuit. 
To determine VTH, set the load as an open circuit. The voltage across the output is VTH. To 
determine IN, set the load as a short circuit, and then the current through the short circuit 
is IN. An important link between Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits is that ZTH and 
ZN are exactly the same value. To determine ZTH or ZN, short-circuit the voltage sources 
and  open-circuit  the  current  sources  in  the  circuit.  ZTH  or  ZN  is  then  the  resulting 
equivalent impedance of the circuit.
