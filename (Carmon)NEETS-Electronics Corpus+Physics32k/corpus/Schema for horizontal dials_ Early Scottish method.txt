Start with the basic method shown above
From G a series of lines, 15Â° apart are drawn, long enough so they cross the line through F. These mark the hour points 1, 2, 3 4, 5 and 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
The centre of the dial is at the bottom, point O. The line drawn from each of these hour point to O will be the hour line on the finished dial.
The significant problem is the width of the paper needed in the higher latitudes.
