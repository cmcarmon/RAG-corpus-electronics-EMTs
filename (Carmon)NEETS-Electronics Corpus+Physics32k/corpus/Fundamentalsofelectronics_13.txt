The conversion of information-bearing signals from one energy form into another is known as energy
conversion or transduction. All conversion systems are ineï¬ƒcient since some input energy is lost as heat,
but this loss does not necessarily mean that the conveyed information is lost. Conceptually we could use any
form of energy to represent information, but electric signals are uniquely well-suited for information repre-
sentation, transmission (signals can be broadcast from antennas or sent through wires), and manipulation
(circuits can be built to reduce noise and computers can be used to modify information). Thus, we will be
concerned with how to
