Chapter 11 discusses the flow of current that is 
measured in amperes. It is the flow of current through 
the body that causes pain and even death from elec-
trical shock. Voltage is the pressure behind electrical 
current, but the current flow is more important than 
voltage when discussing electrical shock. Figure 7-1 
shows that the body resistance is the inverse of cur-
rent through the body. As body resistance decreases, 
the current through the body increases. When the 
body resistance increases, the current flow decreases 
through the body.
