Since inductive reactance increases as frequency increases, the reactance of L1 develops more output
signal as the frequency increases. At the same time, the capacitive reactance of CT is decreasing as
frequency increases. This tends to couple more of the output signal to ground. The increased inductive
reactance counters the effect of the decreased capacitive reactance and this increases the high-frequency
response of the amplifier.
