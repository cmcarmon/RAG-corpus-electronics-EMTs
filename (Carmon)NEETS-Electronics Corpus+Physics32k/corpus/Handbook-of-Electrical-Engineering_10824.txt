Printed Wiring Boards
Printed wiring boards represent the dominant interconnect technology on which chips will be attached and
represents another key opportunity for making signiﬁcant environmental advances. PWB manufacturing is a
complicated process and uses large amounts of materials and energy (e.g., 1 MegaW of heat and 220 kW of
energy  is  consumed  during  fabrication  of  prepeg  for  PWBs).  On  average,  the  waste  streams  constitutes
92%—and the ﬁnal product just 8%—of the total weight of the materials used in PWB production process.
Approximately 80% of the waste produced is hazardous and most of the waste is aqueous, including a range
of  hazardous  chemicals.  Printed  wiring  boards  are  not  recycled  because  the  removal  of  soldered  sub-
assemblies  is  costly  and  advanced  chip  designs  require  new  printed  wiring  boards  to  be  competitive. As  a
result,  the  boards  are  incinerated  and  the  residual  ash  buried  in  hazardous  waste  landﬁlls  due  to  the  lead
content (from lead solder).
