In the next example, hold the TX rotor on 0º and turn the TDX rotor to 120º, as illustrated in view C 
of figure 1-20. In this situation, R1 of the TDX has maximum voltage induced in its winding since it is in 
line with S2. With R1 of the TDX connected to S1 of the TR, the TR stator magnetic field lines up in the 
direction of S1 and causes the TR rotor to turn clockwise to the 240º position. Given, then, that the TX is 
on 360º  (or the 0º position), and subtracting the 120º displacement of the TDX rotor, the difference is 
240º. This is the position at which the TR rotor comes to rest. Therefore, the system has solved the 
equation 360º − 120º  = 240º. The actual subtraction operation of the TDX is a little more apparent in the 
next example.
