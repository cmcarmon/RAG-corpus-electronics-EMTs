Over time, different airline companies have established a number of ultra-long haul non-stop flights. This article covers the longest flights among them. The opening of these super long routes can reduce the number of stops passengers must take to increase passenger comfort in the journey and reduce the time needed to travel between distant city pairs, although stopovers can also be rejuvenating in long distance travel. It also can help build ego and build loyalty among a set of flyers. And thus there is competition among airlines to establish the longest flight, even though these operations often use suboptimal shrunk airliners, are harder to profit from.
