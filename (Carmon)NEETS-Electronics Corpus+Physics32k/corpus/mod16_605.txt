The graticule can be used to determine the voltage of waveforms because the DEFLECTION
SENSITIVITY of a CRT is uniform throughout the vertical plane of the screen. Deflection sensitivity
states the number of inches, centimeters, or millimeters a beam will be deflected for each volt of potential
difference applied to the deflection plates. It is directly proportional to the physical length of the
deflection plates and their distance from the screen and inversely proportional to the distance between the
plates and to the second-anode voltage. Deflection sensitivity is a constant that is dependent on the
construction of the tube.
