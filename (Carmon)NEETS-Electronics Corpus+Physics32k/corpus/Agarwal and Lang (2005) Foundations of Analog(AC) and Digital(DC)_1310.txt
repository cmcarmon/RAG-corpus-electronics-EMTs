Figure 9.39 also illustrates an important point, namely that the flux linked by, and hence
the current through, an inductor is a continuous function of time. Even though V steps
discontinuously at t = 0, i does not; the state Î», and hence i, is continuous. The only way
for i to take a discontinuous step would be for the voltage source to deliver a nonzero
flux linkage in zero time, which requires an infinite voltage. This is of course also not
a practical possibility, although we will see that such a mathematical construction can
also be used very effectively to model certain physical phenomena.
