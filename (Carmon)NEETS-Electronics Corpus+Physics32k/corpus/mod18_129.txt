The traverse and elevation error signals are compared in the radar receiver with the range or
reference signal. The output of the receiver may be either positive or negative pulses; the amplitudes of
the pulses are proportional to the angle between the beam axis and a line drawn to the target. The
polarities of the output pulses indicate whether the target is above or below, to the right or to the left of
the beam axis. Of course, if the target is directly on the line of sight, the output of the receiver is zero and
no angle-tracking error is produced.
