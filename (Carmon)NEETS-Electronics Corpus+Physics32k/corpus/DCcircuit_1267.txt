To put this relationship between voltage and current in a capacitor in calculus terms, the
current through a capacitor is the derivative of the voltage across the capacitor with respect to
time. Or, stated in simpler terms, a capacitor’s current is directly proportional to how quickly
the voltage across it is changing. In this circuit where capacitor voltage is set by the posi-
tion of a rotary knob on a potentiometer, we can say that the capacitor’s current is directly
proportional to how quickly we turn the knob.
