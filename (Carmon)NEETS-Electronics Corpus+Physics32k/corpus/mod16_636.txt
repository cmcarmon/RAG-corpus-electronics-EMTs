As we discussed earlier, channel 1 is being used to discuss basic operating procedures for the
oscilloscope. Figure 6-23 shows how the vertical mode of operation is selected. The VERT MODE
section contains push-button switches that enable you to select channel 1, channel 2, and several other
vertical modes of operation. For the present discussion, note only that CH 1 is selected by these switches.
