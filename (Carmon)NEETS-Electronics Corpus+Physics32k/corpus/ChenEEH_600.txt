Example 7.6. An IGBT is designed with the same pa-
rameters as the MOSFET in example 7.4 by replacing the
nþ substrate with a pþ substrate. A symmetrical struc-
ture is designed for both devices with a voltage blocking
capability of 500 V. The drift region has a minority
carrier lifetime of 1 ms. We can compare the on-state
performance of the IGBT and the MOSFET.
