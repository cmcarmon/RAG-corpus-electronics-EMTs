REFLECTION WAVES are simply waves that are neither transmitted nor absorbed, but are reflected
from the surface of the medium they encounter. If a wave is directed against a reflecting surface, such as a
mirror, it will reflect or "bounce" from the mirror. Refer to figure 1-9. A wave directed toward the surface
of the mirror is called the INCIDENT wave. When the wave bounces off of the mirror, it becomes known
as the REFLECTED wave. An imaginary line perpendicular to the mirror at the point at which the
incident wave strikes the mirrorâ€™s surface is called the NORMAL, or perpendicular. The angle between
the incident wave and the normal is called the ANGLE OF INCIDENCE. The angle between the reflected
wave and the normal is called the ANGLE OF REFLECTION.
