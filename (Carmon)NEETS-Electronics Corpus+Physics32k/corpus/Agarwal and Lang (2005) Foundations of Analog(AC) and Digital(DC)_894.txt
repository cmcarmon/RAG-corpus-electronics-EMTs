You might have realized that although logic devices must demonstrate a gain
greater than unity when they transition from VIL to VIH, they must also atten-
uate the signal at other times. For example, Figure 6.48 shows the signal
from Figure 6.47 with some noise superimposed on it. It should be clear from
Figure 6.48 that to obey the static discipline the buffer has reduced the 0-V to
2-V noise excursions at the input to 0-V to 1-V noise excursions at its output.
We can also verify this fact using the basic noise-margin inequalities in
Equations 6.8 and 6.9. Equations 6.8 implies that any voltage between 0 and
VIL at the input must be attenuated to a voltage between 0 and VOL at the output
(see Figure 6.49). Since VIL > VOL according to Equation 6.8, it follows that
voltage transfer ratio must be less than unity. In other words,
