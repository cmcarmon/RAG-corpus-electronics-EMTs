An antenna is a device used for transmission or reception of
electromagnetic waves, allowing radio-frequency communi-
cation between distant locations across empty space or other
material media. Antennas are fabricated using conducting and/
or dielectric materials, are designed with desirable radiation or
reception characteristics, and employ suitable coupling ar-
