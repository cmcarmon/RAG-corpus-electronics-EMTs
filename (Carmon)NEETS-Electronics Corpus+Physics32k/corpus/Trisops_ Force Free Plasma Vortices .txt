Force free plasma vortices have uniform magnetic helicity and therefore are stable against many instabilities. Typically, the current decays faster in the colder regions until the gradient in helicity is large enough to allow a turbulent redistribution of the current.
Force free vortices follow the following equations.

The first equation describes a Lorentz force-free fluid: the

forces are everywhere zero. For a laboratory plasma α is a constant and β is a scalar function of spatial coordinates.
The magnetic flux surfaces are toroidal, with the current being totally toroidal at the core of the torus and totally poloidal at the surface of the torus. This is similar to the field configuration of a tokamak, except that the field-producing coils are simpler and do not penetrate the plasma torus.
Note that, unlike most plasma structures, the Lorentz force and the Magnus force,
