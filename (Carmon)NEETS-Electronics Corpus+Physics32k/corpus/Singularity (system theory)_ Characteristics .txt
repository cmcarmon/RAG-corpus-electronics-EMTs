In summary, singularities are determined by the following characteristics which can vary in strength:
Instability: Singularities are related to effect in which small causes produce great effects.
System relatedness: Singularities represent a peculiarity based on a system and affect its identity.
Uniqueness: Singularities do not stand out from quantitative singularity, but rather by qualitative uniqueness.
Irreversibility: The caused changes of systems are largely irreversible.
Subjectivity: The awareness is dependent on the human perception and experience.
Randomness: Singularities are often considered as random because generally either the causes or their effects are not well known.
Complexity: Their occurrence is often connected to the complexity of the system and its environment.
Interaction: Singularities often arise when unexpected interactions occur between two systems.
