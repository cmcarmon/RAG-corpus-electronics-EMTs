In plasma physics, the Alfvén time




τ

A




{\displaystyle \tau _{A}}
is an important timescale for wave phenomena. It is related to the Alfvén velocity by:





τ

A


=


a

v

A






{\displaystyle \tau _{A}={\frac {a}{v_{A}}}}

where



a


{\displaystyle a}
denotes the characteristic scale of the system, for example



a


{\displaystyle a}
is the minor radius of the torus in a tokamak.
