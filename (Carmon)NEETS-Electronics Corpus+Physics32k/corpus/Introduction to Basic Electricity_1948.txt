The ohm scale on a meter is different from most 
voltage and current scales (Figure 15-22). It is read 
from right to left instead of from left to right. Also, it 
is a nonlinear scale, so the number of small spaces be-
tween the major intervals is not the same throughout the 
scale. Between 0 and 1 there are five small spaces, which 
equal 0.2 unit each. There are four intervals between 5 
and 10, representing 1 unit each, and between each of 
these there is a minor division that represents 0.5 unit. 
Between the 50 and 100 marks are five small intervals, 
which each represent 10 units. Between 100 and 500, 
there are four small intervals, each representing 100 
units. The last mark on the left is labeled infinity (âˆž). If 
the pointer deflects to this mark, the resistance is beyond 
the range of the meter. The pointer normally rests on the  
infinity mark when no resistance is being measured. 
 Figure 15-23 shows the pointer deflected to 1.5 ohms. 
Figure 15-24 shows the pointer indicating 200 ohms.
