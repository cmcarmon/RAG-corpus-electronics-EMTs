The force equation enables us to calculate the acceleration of a particle with
a given mass for an applied force. This simple force abstraction allows us to
disregard many properties of objects such as their size, shape, density, and
temperature, that are immaterial to the calculation of the objectâ€™s acceleration.
It also allows us to ignore the myriad details of the experiments and observa-
tions that led to the force equation, and accept it as a given. Thus, scientific
laws and abstractions allow us to leverage and build upon past experience and
work. (Without the force abstraction, consider the pain we would have to go
through to perform experiments to achieve the same result.)
