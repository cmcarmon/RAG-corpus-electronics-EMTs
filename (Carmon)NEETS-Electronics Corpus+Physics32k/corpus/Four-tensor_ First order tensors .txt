In special relativity, one of the simplest non-trivial examples of a four-tensor is the four-displacement

{\displaystyle x^{\mu }=(x^{0},x^{1},x^{2},x^{3})\,,}

a four-tensor with contravariant rank 1 and covariant rank 0. Four-tensors of this kind are usually known as four-vectors. Here the component x0 = ct gives the displacement of a body in time (coordinate time t is multiplied by the speed of light c so that x0 has dimensions of length). The remaining components of the four-displacement form the spatial displacement vector x = (x1, x2, x3).
The four-momentum for massive or massless particles is

{\displaystyle p^{\mu }=\left(E/c,p_{x},p_{y},p_{z}\right)}

combines its energy (divided by c) p0 = E/c and 3-momentum p = (p1, p2, p3).
For a particle with relativistic mass m, four momentum is defined by
