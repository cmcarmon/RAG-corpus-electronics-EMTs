As in the DCSK technique, every information bit is transmitted in two pieces: the Ô¨Årst sample function serves
as a reference, while the second one carries the information. The operation of the modulator shown in Fig. 5.33
is similar to DCSK, the difference being that the FM signal, rather than the chaotic signal itself, is applied to
the input of the DCSK modulator. In this example, the chaotic signal is generated by an appropriately designed
analog phase-locked loop (APLL).
