The input stage is a differential amplifier. It allows 
the op-amp to respond only to the differences between 
input signals. Also, the differential amplifier amplifies 
only the differential input voltage and is unaffected 
by signals common to both inputs. This is referred 
to as common-mode rejection. Common-mode 
rejection is useful when measuring a small signal in 
the presence of 60-hertz noise. The 60-hertz noise 
common to both inputs is rejected, and the op-amp 
amplifies only the small difference between the two 
inputs. The differential amplifier has a low-frequency 
 response that extends down to a DC level. This means
