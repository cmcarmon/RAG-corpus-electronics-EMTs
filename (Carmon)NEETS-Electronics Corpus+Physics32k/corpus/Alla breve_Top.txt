Alla breve [alla ˈbrɛːve] is a musical meter notated by the time signature symbol  (a C with a vertical line through it), which is the equivalent of 22. The term is Italian for "in the style of the breve".
Alla breve is a "simple-duple meter with a half-note pulse". The note denomination which represents one beat in is the minim or half-note. There are two of these per bar, so that the time signature 22 may be interpreted as "two minim beats per bar."
In Italian, breve means "short" (for a period of time), and alla breve is also known as cut time or cut common time. (Common time, notated with the time signature symbol , is the equivalent of 44. It uses a quarter note (or crotchet) beat and there are four per bar.)
