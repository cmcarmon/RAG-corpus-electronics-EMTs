Attribute set: A set of vectors (signals) lying in a metric space that possess prescribed properties.
Closed convex sets: A set of vectors C such that if x,y ˛ C then lx + (1 – l)y ˛ C for all 0 £ l £ 1.
Method of successive projections: An iterative procedure for modifying a signal so that the modiﬁed signal
