FIGURE 6.21 Graphical Method of Sketching the Array Factor of a
Four-Element Array. Sketching is done as a function of u in the polar
form. (Top) Normalized array factor as a function of c, plotted in
the rectangular coordinates. (Bottom) Mapping from C to u in polar
coordinates, with f ¼ p=2, where C ¼ k0d sin u sin f þ a ¼ k0d
sin u þ a.
