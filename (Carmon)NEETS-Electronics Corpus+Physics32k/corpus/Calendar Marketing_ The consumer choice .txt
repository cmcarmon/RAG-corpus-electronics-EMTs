In today’s digital landscape, traditional advertising formats — print, TV spots, banner ads — are rapidly losing impact. Social media and email is becoming increasingly saturated. As a result, brands must reframe their marketing propositions as a value-based relationship with consumers.
Calendar marketing fits well with a modern marketing mix, as it enables consumers to self-select promotions for their calendar. Consumers must explicitly opt-in by clicking an “Add to Calendar” button. It’s an approach built for mutually beneficial relationships, instead of mass one-way communication.
