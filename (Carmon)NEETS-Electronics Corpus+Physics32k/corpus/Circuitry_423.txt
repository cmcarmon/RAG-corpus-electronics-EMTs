Integrators 
 
An  integrator  using  an  operational  amplifier  is 
shown  in  Fig.  8.15.  This  circuit  provides  the 
opposite  function  to  that  of  a  differentiator  (see 
earlier)  in  that  its  output  is  equivalent  to  the  area 
under the graph of the input function rather than its 
rate of change. If the input voltage remains constant 
(and is other than 0V) the output voltage will ramp 
up or down according  to the  polarity of the  input. 
The longer the input voltage remains at a particular 
value  the  larger  the  value  of  output  voltage  (of 
either polarity) will be produced.  
  Typical  input  and  output  waveforms  for  an 
integrator  are  shown  in  Fig.  8.16.  Notice  how  the 
square wave input is converted to a wave that has a 
triangular  shape.  Once  again,  note  that  the  output 
waveform is inverted.
