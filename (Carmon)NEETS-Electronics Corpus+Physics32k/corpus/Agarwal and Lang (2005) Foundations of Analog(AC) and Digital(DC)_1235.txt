To understand the behavior of a capacitor, and to illustrate the manner in
which a lumped model can be developed for it, consider the idealized two-
terminal linear capacitor shown in Figure 9.11. In this capacitor each terminal is
connected to a conducting plate. The two plates are parallel and are separated
by a gap of length l. Their area of overlap is A. Note that these dimensions will
be functions of time if the geometry of the capacitor varies. The gap is filled
with an insulating linear dielectric having permittivity .
