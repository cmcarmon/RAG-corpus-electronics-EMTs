Let us now determine quantitatively the propagation delay for a low to high
transition at the input of the inverter. Assume through the rest of this example
that a valid output low voltage, VOL, is 1 volt, and that a valid output high
voltage, VOH, is 4 volts. Also assume RON is 1 k, and that the threshold
on-voltage for the MOSFET is 1 volt. Also assume that RL is 10 k.
