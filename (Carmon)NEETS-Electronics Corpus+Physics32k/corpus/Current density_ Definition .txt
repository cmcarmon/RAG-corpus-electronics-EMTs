Assume that A (SI unit: m2) is a small surface centred at a given point M and orthogonal to the motion of the charges at M. If I (SI unit: A) is the electric current flowing through A, then Electric current density J is given by the limit:

{\displaystyle J=\lim \limits _{A\rightarrow 0}{\frac {I(A)}{A}},}

surface A remaining centred at M and orthogonal to the motion of the charges during the limit process.
The current density vector J is the vector whose magnitude is the electric current density, and whose direction is the same as the motion of the charges at M.
At a given time t, if v is the speed of the charges at M, and dA is an infinitesimal surface centred at M and orthogonal to v, then during an amount of time dt, only the charge contained in the volume formed by dA and l = vdt will flow through dA. This charge is equal to ùùÜ ||v||dt dA, where ùùÜ is the charge density at M, and the electric current at M is I = ùùÜ ||v|| dA. It follows that the current density vector can be expressed as:

{\displaystyle J=\rho {\mathbf {v} }.}

The surface integral of J over a surface S, followed by an integral over the time duration t1 to t2, gives the total amount of charge flowing through the surface in that time (t2 ‚àí t1):

More concisely, this is the integral of the flux of J across S between t1 and t2.
The area required to calculate the flux is real or imaginary, flat or curved, either as a cross-sectional area or a surface. For example, for charge carriers passing through an electrical conductor, the area is the cross-section of the conductor, at the section considered.
The vector area is a combination of the magnitude of the area through which the mass passes through, A, and a unit vector normal to the area,

where ¬∑ is the dot product of the unit vectors. That is, the component of current density passing through the surface (i.e. normal to it) is J cos Œ∏, while the component of current density passing tangential to the area is J sin Œ∏, but there is no current density actually passing through the area in the tangential direction. The only component of current density passing normal to the area is the cosine component.
