The first attempts to present a relativistic (classical) field theory of gravitation were also scalar theories. Gunnar Nordström created two such theories.
Nordström's first idea (1912) was to simply replace the divergence operator in the field equation of Newtonian gravity with the d'Alembertian operator

{\displaystyle \square =\partial _{t}^{2}-\nabla ^{2}}
. This gives the field equation

{\displaystyle \square \Phi =4\pi G\rho }
.
However, several theoretical difficulties with this theory quickly arose, and Nordström dropped it.
A year later, Nordström tried again, presenting the field equation

{\displaystyle \Phi \square \Phi =-4\pi GT}
,
where



T


{\displaystyle T}
is the trace of the stress–energy tensor.
Solutions of Nordström's second theory are conformally flat Lorentzian spacetimes. That is, the metric tensor can be written as

{\displaystyle g_{\mu \nu }=A\eta _{\mu \nu }}
, where
ημν is the Minkowski metric, and




A


{\displaystyle A}
is a scalar which is a function of position.
This suggestion signifies that the inertial mass should depend on the scalar field.
Nordström's second theory satisfies the weak equivalence principle. However:
The theory fails to predict any deflection of light passing near a massive body (contrary to observation)
The theory predicts an anomalous perihelion precession of Mercury, but this disagrees in both sign and magnitude with the observed anomalous precession (the part which cannot be explained using Newtonian gravitation).
Despite these disappointing results, Einstein's critiques of Nordström's second theory played an important role in his development of general relativity.
