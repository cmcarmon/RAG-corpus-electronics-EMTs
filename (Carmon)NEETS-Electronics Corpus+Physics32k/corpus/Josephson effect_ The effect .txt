{\displaystyle I(t)=I_{c}\sin(\varphi (t))}
(Josephson or weak-link current-phase relation)
where



U
(

{\displaystyle U(t)}
and



I
(
t
)


{\displaystyle I(t)}
are the voltage across and the current through the Josephson junction,



φ
(
t
)


{\displaystyle \varphi (t)}
is the "phase difference" across the junction (i.e., the difference in phase factor, or equivalently, argument, between the Ginzburg–Landau complex order parameter of the two superconductors composing the junction), and




I

c




{\displaystyle I_{c}}
is a constant, the "critical current" of the junction. The critical current is an important phenomenological parameter of the device that can be affected by temperature as well as by an applied magnetic field. The physical constant





h

e





{\displaystyle {\frac {h}{2e}}}
is the magnetic flux quantum




Φ

0




{\displaystyle \Phi _{0}}
, the inverse of which is the Josephson constant.

The three main effects predicted by Josephson follow from these relations:
