The internal energy of a closed system changes either by adding heat to the system or by the system performing work. Written mathematically we have




Δ

e

system


=

e

in


−

e

out


,


{\displaystyle \Delta e_{\text{system}}=e_{\text{in}}-e_{\text{out}},}

or





d

U
=
δ
Q
+
δ
W
.


{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} U=\delta Q+\delta W.}

For work as a result of an increase of the system volume we may write





d

U
=
δ
Q
−
P


d

V
.


{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} U=\delta Q-P\,\mathrm {d} V.}

If the heat is added at constant volume, then the second term of this relation vanishes, and one readily obtains






(

U


∂
T



)


V


=


(



∂
Q


∂
T



)


V


=

C

V


.


{\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial U}{\partial T}}\right)_{V}=\left({\frac {\partial Q}{\partial T}}\right)_{V}=C_{V}.}

This defines the heat capacity at constant volume, CV, which is also related to changes in internal energy. Another useful quantity is the heat capacity at constant pressure, CP. This quantity refers to the change in the enthalpy of the system, which is given by




H
=
U
+
P
V
.


{\displaystyle H=U+PV.}

A small change in the enthalpy can be expressed as





d

H
=
δ
Q
+
V


d

P
,


{\displaystyle \mathrm {d} H=\delta Q+V\,\mathrm {d} P,}

and therefore, at constant pressure, we have






(



∂
H


∂
T



)


P


=


(



∂
Q


∂
T



)


P


=

C

P


.


{\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial H}{\partial T}}\right)_{P}=\left({\frac {\partial Q}{\partial T}}\right)_{P}=C_{P}.}

These two equations:






(



∂
U


∂
T



)


V


=


(



∂
Q


∂
T



)


V


=

C

V


,


{\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial U}{\partial T}}\right)_{V}=\left({\frac {\partial Q}{\partial T}}\right)_{V}=C_{V},}

P

{\displaystyle \left({\frac {\partial H}{\partial T}}\right)_{P}=\left({\frac {\partial Q}{\partial T}}\right)_{P}=C_{P}}

are property relations and are therefore independent of the type of process. In other words, they are valid for any substance going through any process. Both the internal energy and enthalpy of a substance can change with the transfer of energy in many forms i.e., heat.
