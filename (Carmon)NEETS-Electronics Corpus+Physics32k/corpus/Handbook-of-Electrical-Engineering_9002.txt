Electrophotographic Printing
EP printers use essentially the same technology found in most “plain paper” copiers, the major exception being
the printhead. Instead of using page- or line-imaging optics as in a copier, the printhead utilizes a solid-state
laser (usually GaAlAs) or gas laser (typically HeNe) to scan across and expose a photoconductor drum or belt
to create a “latent image” (see below). A few EP printers use stitched arrays of light-emitting GaAs1–xPx diodes
(LEDs) with Selfoc(cid:212) glass ﬁber optics or an array of liquid crystal shutters, the latter to modulate light from
a bright line light source. Other possibilities are electroluminescent, magnetooptic or electrooptic arrays, but
these have not been commercialized to any extent.
