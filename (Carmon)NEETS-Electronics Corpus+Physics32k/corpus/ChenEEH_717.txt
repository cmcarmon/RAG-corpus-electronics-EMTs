High performance applications do need a high bandwidth
for their data. This high memory bandwidth requirement will
typically involve a high system cost. A clear insight in these costs
is necessary to optimize the memory subsystem. The cost will
nearly always boil down to energy and area/size. These are the
relevant costs for the end user and manufacturer. A high
memory bandwidth can be obtained in several ways. Basically,
two classes of solutions exist to obtain a high bandwidth: high
access speed over a single port and high parallelism. Both come
with large costs in energy and area.
