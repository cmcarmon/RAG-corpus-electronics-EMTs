Dynamic Power Management
Dynamic power management techniques allow systems or
systemâ€™s blocks to be placed in low-power sleep modes when
the systems are inactive. Normally, not all blocks of a system
participate in performing different functions, and it is useful to
shut down inactive blocks to reduce power consumption. For
example, in a general microprocessor, a register-based instruc-
tion does not access the data memory and some other
modules, so these components can be deactivated to achieve
power savings. In this case, more control is involved, but it is
true that the waking up of these deactivated blocks is expensive
in terms of speed or performance.
