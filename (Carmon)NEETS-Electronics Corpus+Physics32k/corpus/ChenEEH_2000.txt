The address of the destination register and its new value are
stored in the DWB, which is an N-level FIFO buffer. This
storage structure is composed of an N-level data FIFO that
contains the values of the registers that have been written and
an N-level content associative memory (CAM) that stores the
addresses of the written registers plus valid bits for the data
FIFO entries. In each clock cycle, if a write register operation is
executed, a new line of the DWB is ﬁlled; otherwise, the line is
invalidated by resetting the corresponding valid bit in the
CAM. This microrollback structure also accommodates the
needed change in the read of the register ﬁle so that the latest
value of the addressed register is read. During a read, the DWB
checks the CAM to determine if the addressed register’s con-
tent is stored in its data store. If so, a priority circuit chooses
the most recent written value of the addressed register to be
read out of the data FIFO. A microrollback of d clock cycles is
implemented simply by invalidating the ﬁrst (most recent) d
locations of the DWB.
