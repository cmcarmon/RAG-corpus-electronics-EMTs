The generally preferred method of range switching is shown in (figure 3-5, view B). Although only
two ranges are shown, as many ranges as needed can be used. In this type of circuit, the contact resistance
of the range-selector switch is external to the shunt and meter in each range position. The contact
resistance in this case has no effect on the accuracy of the current measurement.
