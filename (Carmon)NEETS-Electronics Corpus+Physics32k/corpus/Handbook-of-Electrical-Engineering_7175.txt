Backoff: AmpliÔ¨Åers are not linear devices when operated near saturation. To reduce intermodulation products
for  multiple  carriers,  the  drive  signal  is  reduced  or  backed  off.  Input  backoff  is  the  decibel  difference
between  the  input  power  required  for  saturation  and  that  employed.  Output  backoff  refers  to  the
reduction in output power relative to saturation.
