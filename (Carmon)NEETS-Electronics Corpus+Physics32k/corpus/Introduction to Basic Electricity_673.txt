Different symbols may be used depending on the 
use of the drawing. For example, electrical	symbols 
used in architectural drawings (Figure 5-1) are differ-
ent from symbols used in schematic diagram electron-
ics (Figure 5-2). In wiring a house, look for symbols 
prominent in house wiring. Any electrical fixture 
found in a house has a symbol that coincides to it on 
an electrical drawing (Figure 5-3). These drawings al-
low an electrical contractor to easily read the diagram 
during the construction phase.
