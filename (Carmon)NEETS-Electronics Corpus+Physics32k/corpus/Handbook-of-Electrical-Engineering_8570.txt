Emulator: The ﬁrmware that simulates a given machine architecture.
Firmware: Meant  as  an  intermediate  between  software,  which  can  be  modiﬁed  very  easily,  and  hardware,
which is practically unchangeable (once built); the word ﬁrmware was coined to represent the micropro-
gram in control memory, i.e., the modiﬁable representation of the CPU instruction set.
