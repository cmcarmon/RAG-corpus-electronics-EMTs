The true importance of the fusion of science and
engineering  in  the  industrial  laboratory  was  made
apparent  to  all  in  the  years  after  World  War  II.  In
1947,  three  Bell  Labs  physicist-engineers  produced
the single most signiﬁcant electronic invention of the
era—the  transistor.  John  Bardeen,  Walter  Brattain,
and  William  Shockley  were  consciously  seeking  to
exploit new technology about the behavior of semiconducting materials when they devised a way to make
a  crystal  of  germanium  do  the  work  of  a  triode  vacuum  tube,  the  most  basic  of  electronic  components.
