A space gun with a "gun barrel" of length (



l


{\displaystyle l}
), and the needed velocity (




v

e




{\displaystyle v_{e}}
), the acceleration (

) is provided by the following formula:

l





{\displaystyle a={\frac {v_{e}^{2}}{2l}}}

For instance, with a space gun with a vertical "gun barrel" through both the Earth's crust and the troposphere, totalling ~60 km of length (



l


{\displaystyle l}
), and a velocity (




v

e




{\displaystyle v_{e}}
) enough to escape the Earth's gravity (escape velocity, which is 11.2 km/s on Earth), the acceleration (



a


{\displaystyle a}
) would theoretically be more than 1000 m/s2, which is more than 100 g-forces, which is about 3 times the human tolerance to g-forces of maximum 20 to 35 g during the ~10 seconds such a firing would take. Theoretically, a space gun with a circular (ring shaped) track could utilize much lower accelerations because its effective track length is infinite (with the object going around the ring numerous times), though the centripetal acceleration could be enormous as the payload neared escape velocity, depending on the track size.
