Notice that the AMOUNT of current is the same as before. The polarity, however, is NEGATIVE.
The negative polarity simply indicates the wrong direction of current was assumed. Should it be necessary
to use this current in further calculations on the circuit using Kirchhoffâ€™s law, the negative polarity should
be retained in the calculations.
