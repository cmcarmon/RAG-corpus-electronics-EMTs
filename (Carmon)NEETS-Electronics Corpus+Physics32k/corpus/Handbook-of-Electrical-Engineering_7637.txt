pulse coincide at the input to the ﬁrst ﬁber and g2 and the clock pulse coincide (in the absence of g1) at the
input to the second ﬁber. At the output the two input signals are blocked by the polarizer, allowing only the
temporally modiﬁed clock pulse to pass. In a prototyped demonstration this all-optical NOR gate required 5.8
pJ of signal energy and provided an effective gain of 6.
