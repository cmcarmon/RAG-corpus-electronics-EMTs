Exercise 2.5
(Solution on p. 30.)
Mentioned earlier was the issue of whether the ordering of systems mattered. In other words, if
we have two systems in cascade, does the output depend on which comes ﬁrst? Determine if the
ordering matters for the cascade of an ampliﬁer and a delay and for the cascade of a time-reversal
system and a delay.
