The angular diameter of a circle whose plane is perpendicular to the displacement vector between the point of view and the centre of said circle can be calculated using the formula

,


{\displaystyle \delta =2\arctan \left({\frac {d}{2D}}\right),}

in which



δ


{\displaystyle \delta }
is the angular diameter, and



d


{\displaystyle d}
and



D


{\displaystyle D}
are the actual diameter of and the distance to the object. When



D
≫
d


{\displaystyle D\gg d}
, we have



δ

{\displaystyle \delta \approx d/D}
, and the result obtained is in radians.
For a spherical object whose actual diameter equals




d


a

,


{\displaystyle d_{\mathrm {act} },}
and where



D


{\displaystyle D}
is the distance to the centre of the sphere, the angular diameter can be found by the formula

{\displaystyle \delta =2\arcsin \left({\frac {d_{\mathrm {act} }}{2D}}\right)}

The difference is due to the fact that the apparent edges of a sphere are its tangent points, which are closer to the observer than the centre of the sphere. For practical use, the distinction is only significant for spherical objects that are relatively close, since the small-angle approximation holds for
