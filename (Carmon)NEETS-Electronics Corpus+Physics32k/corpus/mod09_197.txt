A RESONANT CIRCUIT is often called a TANK CIRCUIT. It has the ability to take energy fed 
from a power source, store the energy alternately in the inductor and capacitor, and produce an output 
which is a continuous a.c. wave. The number of times this set of events occurs per second is called the 
resonant frequency of the circuit. The actual frequency at which a tank circuit will oscillate is determined 
by the formula:
