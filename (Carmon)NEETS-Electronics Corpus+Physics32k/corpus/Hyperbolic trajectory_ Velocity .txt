Under standard assumptions the orbital speed (



v



{\displaystyle v\,}
) of a body traveling along a hyperbolic trajectory can be computed from the vis-viva equation as:




v
=


μ

(



2

r



−


1

a




)





{\displaystyle v={\sqrt {\mu \left({2 \over {r}}-{1 \over {a}}\right)}}}

where:




μ



{\displaystyle \mu \,}
is standard gravitational parameter,




r



{\displaystyle r\,}
is radial distance of orbiting body from central body,




a




{\displaystyle a\,\!}
is the (negative) semi-major axis.
Under standard assumptions, at any position in the orbit the following relation holds for orbital velocity (



v



{\displaystyle v\,}
), local escape velocity (





v

e
s
c






{\displaystyle {v_{esc}}\,}
) and hyperbolic excess velocity (




v

∞






{\displaystyle v_{\infty }\,\!}
):





v

=



v

v

{\displaystyle v^{2}={v_{esc}}^{2}+{v_{\infty }}^{2}}

Note that this means that a relatively small extra delta-v above that needed to accelerate to the escape speed results in a relatively large speed at infinity. For example, at a place where escape speed is 11.2 km/s, the addition of 0.4 km/s yields a hyperbolic excess speed of 3.02 km/s.

3.02


{\displaystyle {\sqrt {11.6^{2}-11.2^{2}}}=3.02}

This is an example of the Oberth effect. The converse is also true - a body does not need to be slowed by much compared to its hyperbolic excess speed (e.g. by atmospheric drag near periapsis) for velocity to fall below escape velocity and so for the body to be captured.
