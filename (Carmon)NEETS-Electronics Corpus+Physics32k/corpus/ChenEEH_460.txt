In the above integrands, CjEi and CjCi are the BE and BC
depletion capacitance, CdE and CdC are the BE and BC diffu-
sion capacitance, and tf and tr are the minority storage times,
which are often called transit times. The latter are strongly
bias-dependent small-signal quantities, which will be discussed
later in more detail. From a comparison of equations 5.14
and 5.12, it becomes obvious that there is no single Early
voltage (i.e., the Early voltage is bias-dependent and modeled
by QjCi).
