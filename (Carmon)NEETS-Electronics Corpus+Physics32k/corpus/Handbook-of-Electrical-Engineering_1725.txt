number is the sampled value of the image at a pixel (picture element) location. These numbers are represented

with ﬁnite precision using a ﬁxed number of bits. Until recently, the dominant image size was 512

with 8 bits or 1 byte per pixel. The total storage size for such an image is 512

When digital image processing ﬁrst emerged in the 1960s, this was considered to be a formidable amount of
data, and so interest in developing ways to reduce this storage requirement arose immediately. Since that time,
image compression has continued to be an active area of research. The recent emergence of standards for image
coding algorithms and the commercial availability of very large scale integration (VLSI) chips that implement
image coding algorithms is indicative of the present maturity of the ﬁeld, although research activity continues
apace.
