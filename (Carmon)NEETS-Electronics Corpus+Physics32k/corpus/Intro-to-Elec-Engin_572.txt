Seven-segment displays are the most commonly used numeric display devices, while 10- and
16-segment (starburst) display devices are also available. Figure 6.2.18(a) depicts a common-
cathode seven-segment LED display; Figure 6.2.18(b) shows its internal structure, consisting of
a single LED for each of the segments; and Figure 6.2.18(c) displays the digits by an appropriate
combination of lighted segments. The 16-segment display shown in Figure 6.2.18(d) is commonly
used for alphanumeric data.
