The speed of the rotor depends upon the torque requirements of the load. The bigger the load, the
stronger the turning force needed to rotate the rotor. The turning force can increase only if the rotor-
induced emf increases. This emf can increase only if the magnetic field cuts through the rotor at a faster
rate. To increase the relative speed between the field and rotor, the rotor must slow down. Therefore, for
heavier loads the induction motor turns slower than for lighter loads. You can see from the previous
statement that slip is directly proportional to the load on the motor. Actually only a slight change in speed
is necessary to produce the usual current changes required for normal changes in load. This is because the
rotor windings have such a low resistance. As a result, induction motors are called constant-speed motors.
