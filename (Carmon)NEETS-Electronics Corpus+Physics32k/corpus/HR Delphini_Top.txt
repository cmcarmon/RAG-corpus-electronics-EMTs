HR Delphini (HR Del) was a nova, which appeared in the constellation Delphinus in 1967. It is thought to have reached magnitude 3.6.
G.E.D. Alcock discovered the nova on 10 July 1967 after combing the skies for 800 hours. It continued to brighten, reaching a peak of magnitude 3.5 on 13 December 1967 before fading quickly to magnitude 5.1, and then oscillating between magnitudes 4.4 and 5.75, and reaching magnitude 4.2 in May 1968 before fading steadily; it was magnitude 9.75 by the end of 1971.
Before its outburst, it had been noted as a variable star of magnitude 12.
It gained its name in the 1968 IAU variable star name list.
