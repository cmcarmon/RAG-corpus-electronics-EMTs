You can determine the physical size and type of a fuse by looking at it, but you must know other
things about a fuse to use it properly. Fuses are rated by current, voltage, and time-delay characteristics to
aid in the proper use of the fuse. To select the proper fuse, you must understand the meaning of each of
the fuse ratings.
