Problem 4.7: Duality in Fourier Transforms
“Duality” means that the Fourier transform and the inverse Fourier transform are very similar. Consequently,
the waveform s (t) in the time domain and the spectrum s (f ) have a Fourier transform and an inverse Fourier
transform, respectively, that are very similar.
