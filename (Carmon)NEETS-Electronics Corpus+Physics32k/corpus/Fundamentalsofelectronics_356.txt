Property 4.4:
The spectral coeﬃcients for a periodic signal delayed by τ, s (t − τ ), are cke
, where ck denotes
the spectrum of s (t). Delaying a signal by τ seconds results in a spectrum having a linear phase
shift of − 2πkτ
in comparison to the spectrum of the un-delayed signal. Note that the spectral
T
magnitude is unaﬀected. Showing this property is easy.
