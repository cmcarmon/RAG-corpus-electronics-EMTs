Determination of Resistivity and Hall Coefﬁcient
Consider the Hall-bar structure of Fig. 22.35(a) and suppose that current I is ﬂowing along the long direction.
Then, if Vc and VH are the voltages measured along dimensions ᐉ and w, respectively, and d is the thickness,
one obtains Ex = Vc /ᐉ, Ey = VH/w, jx = I/wd, and
