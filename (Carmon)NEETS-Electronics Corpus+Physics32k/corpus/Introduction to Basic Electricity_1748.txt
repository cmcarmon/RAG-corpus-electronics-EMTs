The path the electric current takes to the load may 
be through any of three types of circuits: a series cir-
cuit, a parallel circuit, or a series-parallel circuit. A 
series circuit (Figure 14-1) offers a single continuous 
path for the current flow, going from the source to the 
load. A parallel circuit (Figure 14-2) offers more than 
one path for current flow. It allows the source to apply 
voltage to more than one load. It also allows several
