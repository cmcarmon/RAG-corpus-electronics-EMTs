Load voltage regulation is achieved by decreasing the switching frequency below the rated value. Since
the inverter output current i leads the inverter output voltage vAB, this type of operation is also called a
leading  PF  mode  of  operation.  If  transistors  are  used  as  the  switching  devices,  then  for  operation  in
DCM,  the  pulsewidth  can  be  kept  constant  while  decreasing  the  switching  frequency  to  avoid  CCM
operation. DCM operation has the advantages of negligible switching losses due to ZCS, lower di/dt and
dv/dt stresses, and simple control circuitry. However, DCM operation results in higher switch peak currents.
From the waveforms shown in Fig. 30.33, the following problems can be identiÔ¨Åed for operation in
the  below-resonance  mode:  requirement  of  di/dt  inductors  to  limit  the  large  turn-on  switch  currents
and a need for lossy RC snubbers and fast recovery diodes. Since the switching frequency is decreased
to control the load power, the HF transformer and magnetics must be designed for the lowest switching
frequency, resulting in increased size of the converter.
