autorouter  programs  are  designed  to  use 
the computer to lay out a printed circuit board. 
 Autorouters should not be relied on unless they are 
“smart.” Typical low-cost routers only connect points 
together. They don’t consider the length of the trace, 
which traces are analog and which are digital, which 
lines are sensitive, which are ground loops, and so on. 
Subtle points can make a significant difference in how 
a printed circuit board performs. It’s easier to lay out 
a printed circuit board manually than to root out elu-
sive errors made by a program. Autorouter programs 
include National Instrument’s Ultiboard, New Wave 
Concepts’ Circuit Wizard, and Cadence’s OrCAD 
PCB Designer.
