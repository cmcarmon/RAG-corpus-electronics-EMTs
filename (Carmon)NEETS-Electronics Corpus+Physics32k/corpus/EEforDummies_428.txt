Another, less‐often‐used numbering system uses both numbers and letters, 
like this: 4R1. The placement of the letter R tells you the position of the deci-
mal point: 4R1 is really 4.1. This numbering system doesn’t indicate the units 
of measure, however, which can be either microfarads or picofarads.
