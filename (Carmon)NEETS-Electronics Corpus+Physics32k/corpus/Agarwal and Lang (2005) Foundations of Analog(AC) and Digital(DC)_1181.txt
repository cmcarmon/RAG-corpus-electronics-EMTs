r e s i s t a n c e o f t h e b j t a m p l i f i e r Let us first compute the
small-signal input and output resistances of the common emitter BJT amplifier. The
general approach to doing so is to turn off all independent sources and to apply a
test voltage (or current) at the input or output port as appropriate and to measure the
resulting current (or voltage). The ratio of the voltage to the current gives the resistance.
