The software tool MO²GO (method for an object-oriented business process optimization) supports the modeling process based on the integrated enterprise modeling (IEM). Different analyses of a given model are available like the planning and implementation of information systems. The MO²GO system is expandable easily and makes a high-speed modeling approach possible.
The currently used MO²GO system consists of the following components:
MO²GO version 2.4: This component offers modeling functions for class structures, process chains and mechanism for analysis of IEM.
MO²GO Macro editor version 2.1 : The macro editor supports the outline of MO²GO macros for user-defined evaluation procedures.
MO²GO Viewer version 1.07 : The Java-based and licence free MO²GO Viewer is a user interface to be used easily to navigate process chains through MO²GO.
MO²GO XML converter version 1.0 : Nowadays the IT implementation works mainly with UML diagrams. MO²GO supports a component for a model based XML file which can be imported in UML tools.
MO²GO Web publisher version 2.0 : The web Publisher is a mechanism of analysis to be started directly out of MO²GO 2.4. A process assistant is the result of the evaluation of the model contents based on texture and hyperlink representation. To be able to adapt the process assistant to the user requirements flexibly, the web Publisher contains a configuration component.
