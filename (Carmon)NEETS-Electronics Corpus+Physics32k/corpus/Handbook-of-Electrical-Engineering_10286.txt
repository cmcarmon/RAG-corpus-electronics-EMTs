The free ﬂight concept will require the equipage of virtually all aircraft operating within the designated free-
ﬂight airspace with a commensurate level of avionics capability. The early stages of the concept development
uncovered  the  need  to  upgrade  virtually  all  aircraft  with  enhanced  CNS/ATM  avionics.  The  air  transport
industry  resolved  this  problem  on  older  airplanes  by  developing  improved  and  new  avionics  for  retroﬁt
applications. The new avionics design addresses the issues of increased accuracy of position and enhancement
of navigation management in the form of the GNSS Navigation and Landing Unit (GNLU) housed in a single
unit  and  designed  to  be  a  physical  and  functional  replacement  for  the  ILS  and/or  MLS  receivers. A  built-in
navigator  provides  enhanced  navigation  functionality  for  the  airplane.  The  GNSS  can  provide  ILS  lookalike
signals and perform landing guidance functions equivalent to Category I.
