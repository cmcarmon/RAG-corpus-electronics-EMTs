Some capacitors (electrolytic) are asymmetric devices with a polarity that must be
hooked-up in a deﬁnite way. You will learn this in the lab. The SI unit for capacitance
is farad (F). The capacitance in a circuit is typically measured in µF or pF. Non-ideal cir-
cuits will have stray capacitance, leakage currents and inductive coupling at high frequency.
Although important in real circuit design we will slip over these nasties at this point.
Capacitors can be obtained in various tolerance ratings from ±20% to ±0.5%.
Because of dimensional changes, capacitors have a high temperature dependence
of capacitance. A capacitor does not hold a charge indeﬁnitely because the dielec-
tric is never a perfect insulator. Capacitors are rated for leakage, the conduction
through the dielectric, by the leakage resistance-capacitance product in MΩ· µF.
High temperature increases leakage.
