The memory (internal storage) section of a computer is essentially an electronically operated file 
cabinet. It has a large number (usually several hundred thousand) of storage locations; each referred to as 
a storage address or register. Every item of data and program instruction read into the computer during the 
loading process is stored or filed in a specific storage address and is almost instantly accessible.
