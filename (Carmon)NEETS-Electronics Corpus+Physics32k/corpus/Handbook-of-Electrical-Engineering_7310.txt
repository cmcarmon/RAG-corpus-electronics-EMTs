  (PLL)  is  a  system  that  uses  feedback  to  maintain  an  output  signal  in  a  speciﬁc  phase
relationship with a reference signal. PLLs are used in many areas of electronics to control the frequency and/or
phase of a signal. These applications include frequency synthesizers, analog and digital modulators and demod-
phase
ulators,  and  clock  recovery  circuits.  Figure  76.1  shows  the  block  diagram  of  a  basic  PLL  system.  The 
 consists of a device that produces an output voltage proportional to the phase difference of the two

a circuit that is used to control the PLL dynamics and therefore the performance of the system. The 
is used to denote the Laplace transfer function of this ﬁlter.
