If natural gas is extracted from a natural gas field the initial pressure (up to 60 MPa (600 bar)) in the field will drop over the years. The gas molecules help support the soil layers above the field. If the gas is extracted, the overburden pressure sediment compacts and may lead to subsidence at the ground level.
Since exploitation of the Slochteren (Netherlands) gas field started in the late 1960s the ground level over a 250 kmÂ² area has dropped by a current maximum of 30 cm.
