in which a > 1 for step-down, a < 1 for step-up transformers.
The input apparent power is S1 = V1I1, while the output apparent power is given by
S2 = V2I2. The apparent power transformed by electromagnetic induction (or transformer action)
is Sind = V2I3 = (V1−V2)I2. The output transferred by electrical conduction (because of the direct
electrical connection between primary and secondary windings) is given by Scond = V2I2−V2I3 =
V2I1.
