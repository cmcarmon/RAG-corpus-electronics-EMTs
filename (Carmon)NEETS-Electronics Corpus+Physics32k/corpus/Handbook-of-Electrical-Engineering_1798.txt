to obtain a relationship for the update term U i. In the previous equation,  TS is the temporal sample spacing.
If the displacement estimate is updated from sample to sample using a steepest-descent algorithm to minimize

the weighted sum of the squared displaced frame differences over a neighborhood, then  D
