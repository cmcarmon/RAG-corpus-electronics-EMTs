If one disregards the tangential components of the velocity field, as frequently done in the study of thin fluid film, one arrives at the following simplified system with only two unknowns: the two dimensional density



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
and the normal velocity



C


{\displaystyle C}
:

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}{\frac {\delta \rho }{\delta t}}&=\rho CB_{\alpha }^{\alpha }\\&\\\rho {\frac {\delta C}{\delta t}}&=\sigma B_{\alpha }^{\alpha }\\\end{aligned}}}
