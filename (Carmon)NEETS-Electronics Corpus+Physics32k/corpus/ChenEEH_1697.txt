Observing the fact that single features cannot be used accu-
rately in a wide variety of situations, Chen et al. (2004) have
proposed to construct a high-dimensional feature vector called
generalized trace (GT) by extracting a set of features from each
dc frame. For each frame, GT contains the number of intra-
coded as well as forward- and backward-predicted macro-
blocks; a histogram intersection of current and previous
frames for Y, U, and V color components; and a standard
deviation of Y, U, and V components for the current frame.
GT is then used in a binary regression tree to determine the
probability that each frame is a shot boundary. These prob-
abilities are used to determine the frames that most likely
correspond to the shot boundary.
