In  practice  560  kG (the  nearest  preferred  value  – 
see page 21) would be adequate. 
  The ‘start’ button needs to be connected between 
pin-2 and ground whilst the ‘stop’ button needs to 
be  connected  between  pin-4  and  ground.  Each  of 
the inputs requires a pull-up resistor to ensure that 
the input is taken high when the switch is not being 
operated. The precise value of the ‘pull-up’ resistor 
is  unimportant  and  a  value  of  10  kG will  be 
perfectly adequate in this application. The complete 
circuit of the 60 s timer is shown in Fig. 12.6.
