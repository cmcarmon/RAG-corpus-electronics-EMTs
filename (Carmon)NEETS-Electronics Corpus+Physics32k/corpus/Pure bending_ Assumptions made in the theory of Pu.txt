The material of the beam is homogeneous1 and isotropic2.
The value of Young's Modulus of Elasticity is same in tension and compression.
The transverse sections which were plane before bending, remain plane after bending also.
The beam is initially straight and all longitudinal filaments bend into circular arcs with a common centre of curvature.
The radius of curvature is large as compared to the dimensions of the cross-section.
Each layer of the beam is free to expand or contract, independently of the layer, above or below it.
Notes: 1 Homogeneous means the material is of same kind throughout. 2 Isotropic means that the elastic properties in all directions are equal.
