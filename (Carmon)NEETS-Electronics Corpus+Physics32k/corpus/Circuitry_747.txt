Available in diffuse and through scan types. Diffuse scan types require 
reflective  targets.  Both  types  employ  optical  transmitters  and  receivers 
(usually infra-red emitting LEDs and photo-diodes or photo-transistors). 
Digital input port required. 
Foil type resistive element with polyester backing for attachment to body 
under  stress.  Normally  connected  in  full  bridge  configuration  with 
temperature-compensating gauges to provide an analogue output voltage. 
Piezo-resistive  elements  provide  greater  outputs  than  comparable 
resistive  foil  types.  More  prone  to  temperature  changes  and  also 
inherently non-linear. 
Small e.m.f. generated by a junction between two dissimilar metals. For 
accurate  measurement,  requires  compensated  connecting  cables  and 
specialized interface. 
Usually connected as part of a potential divider or bridge. An analogue 
output  voltage  results  from  resistance  changes  within  the  sensing 
element. 
Two-terminal device connected as a current source. An analogue output 
voltage is developed across a series resistor of appropriate value.
