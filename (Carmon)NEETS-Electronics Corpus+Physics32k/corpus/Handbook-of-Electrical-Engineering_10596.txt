A recent study indicates that 2 F40T12 lamps operated on an electronic ballast will attain an efﬁcacy of 75–80
LPW versus 62 LPW for the same lamps if operated on a standard core-coil type ballast. With the dimmable
electronically ballasted system, energy savings can be as high as 40% with respect to a core ballasted system.
