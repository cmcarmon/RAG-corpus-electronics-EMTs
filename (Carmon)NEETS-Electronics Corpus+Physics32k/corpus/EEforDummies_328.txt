One law, three equations
Remember your high‐school algebra? Remember how you can rearrange 
the terms of an equation containing variables (such as the familiar x and 
y) to solve for one variable, as long as you know the values of the other 
 variables? Well, the same rules apply to Ohm’s Law. You can rearrange its 
terms to create two more equations, for a total of three equations from that 
one law!
