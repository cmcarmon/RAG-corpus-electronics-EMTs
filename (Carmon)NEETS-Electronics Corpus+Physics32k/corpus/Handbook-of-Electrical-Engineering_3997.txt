are available, the three-terminal device offers a more attractive design solution and will be selected. Two-terminal
devices  are  generally  only  used  when  a  comparable  three-terminal  device  is  not  available.  For  this  reason
IMPATT and TED devices are used in millimeter-wave applications, where they retain an advantage in providing
good RF power. Tunnel diodes are not often used, except in a few special applications where their low-noise
and wide-bandwidth performance can be used to advantage.
