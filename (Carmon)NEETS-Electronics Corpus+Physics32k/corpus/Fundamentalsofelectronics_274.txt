3.19.3 Intuitive Way of Solving Op-Amp Circuits
When we meet op-amp design speciﬁcations, we can simplify our circuit calculations greatly, so much so that
we don’t need the op-amp’s circuit model to determine the transfer function. Here is our inverting ampliﬁer.
When we take advantage of the op-amp’s characteristics—large input impedance, large gain, and small
