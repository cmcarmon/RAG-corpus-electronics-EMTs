Similarly, in the case of Bell's spaceship paradox the relation between the initial rest length



L


{\displaystyle L}
between the ships (identical to the moving length in S after acceleration) and the new rest length




L
′



{\displaystyle L'}
in S′ after acceleration, is:





L
′

=
γ
L


{\displaystyle L'=\gamma L}
.
This length increase can be calculated in different ways. For instance, if the acceleration is finished the ships will constantly remain at the same location in the final rest frame S′, so it's only necessary to compute the distance between the x-coordinates transformed from S to S′. If




x

A




{\displaystyle x_{A}}
and




x

B


=

x

A


+
L


{\displaystyle x_{B}=x_{A}+L}
are the ships' positions in S, the positions in their new rest frame S′ are:









x

A

=
γ

(

)






x

)






L

L






{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}x'_{A}&=\gamma \left(x_{A}-vt\right)\\x'_{B}&=\gamma \left(x_{A}+L-vt\right)\\L'&=x'_{B}-x'_{A}\\&=\gamma L\end{aligned}}}

Another method was shown by Dewan (1963) who demonstrated the importance of relativity of simultaneity. The perspective of frame S′ is described, in which both ships will be at rest after the acceleration is finished. The ships are accelerating simultaneously at




t

A


=

t

B




{\displaystyle t_{A}=t_{B}}
in S (assuming acceleration in infinitesimal small time), though B is accelerating and stopping in S′ before A due to relativity of simultaneity, with the time difference:








Δ

=

t

−

t

=

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\Delta t'&=t'_{B}-t'_{A}=\gamma \left(t_{B}-{\frac {vx_{B}}{c^{2}}}\right)-\gamma \left(t_{A}-{\frac {vx_{A}}{c^{2}}}\right)\\&={\frac {\gamma vL}{c^{2}}}\end{aligned}}}

Since the ships are moving with the same velocity in S′ before acceleration, the initial rest length



L


{\displaystyle L}
in S is shortened in S′ by




L

o
l
d

′

=
L

/

γ


{\displaystyle L'_{old}=L/\gamma }
due to length contraction. This distance starts to increase after B came to stop, because A is now moving away from B with constant velocity during



Δ

t
′



{\displaystyle \Delta t'}
until A stops as well. Dewan arrived at the relation (in different notation):









L

=

L






{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}L'&=L'_{old}+v\Delta t'={\frac {L}{\gamma }}+{\frac {\gamma v^{2}L}{c^{2}}}\\&=\gamma L\end{aligned}}}

It was also noted by several authors that the constant length in S and the increased length in S′ is consistent with the length contraction formula



L
=

L
′


/

γ


{\displaystyle L=L'/\gamma }
, because the initial rest length



L


{\displaystyle L}
is increased by



γ


{\displaystyle \gamma }
in S′, which is contracted in S by the same factor, so it stays the same in S:





L

o

.


=

γ

{\displaystyle L_{contr.}=L'/\gamma =\gamma L/\gamma =L}

Summarizing: While the rest distance between the ships increases to



γ
L


{\displaystyle \gamma L}
in S′, the relativity principle requires that the string (whose physical constitution is unaltered) maintains its rest length



L


{\displaystyle L}
in its new rest system S′. Therefore, it breaks in S′ due to the increasing distance between the ships. As explained above, the same is also obtained by only considering the start frame S using length contraction of the string (or the contraction of its moving molecular fields) while the distance between the ships stays the same due to equal acceleration.
