The specific combination of protons, electrons, and neutrons in an atom 
defines the type of atom, and substances made up of just one type of atom 
are known as elements. (You may remember wrestling with the Periodic 
Table of the Elements way back in Chemistry class.) I show a simplistic 
representation of a helium atom in Figure 1-2 and one of a copper atom in 
Figure 1-3.
