The firehose instability can be analyzed exactly in the case of an infinitely thin, self-gravitating sheet of stars. If the sheet experiences a small displacement

The first term, which arises from the perturbed gravity, is stabilizing, while the second term, due to the centrifugal force that the stars exert on the sheet, is destabilizing.

A similar analysis can be carried out for a galaxy that is idealized as a one-dimensional wire, with density that varies along the axis. This is a simple model of a (prolate) elliptical galaxy. Some unstable eigenmodes are shown in Figure 2 at left.
