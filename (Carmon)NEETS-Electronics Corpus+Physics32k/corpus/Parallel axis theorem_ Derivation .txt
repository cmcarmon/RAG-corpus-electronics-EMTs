We may assume, without loss of generality, that in a Cartesian coordinate system the perpendicular distance between the axes lies along the x-axis and that the center of mass lies at the origin. The moment of inertia relative to the z-axis is





I


c
m



=
∫
(

x

2


+

y

2


)

d
m
.


{\displaystyle I_{\mathrm {cm} }=\int (x^{2}+y^{2})\,dm.}

The moment of inertia relative to the axis z′, which is a perpendicular distance d along the x-axis from the centre of mass, is




I
=
∫

[

(
x
+
d

)

2


+

y

]


d
m


{\displaystyle I=\int \left[(x+d)^{2}+y^{2}\right]\,dm}

Expanding the brackets yields




I
=
∫
(

x

2


+

y

)

d

∫

{\displaystyle I=\int (x^{2}+y^{2})\,dm+d^{2}\int dm+2d\int x\,dm.}

The first term is Icm and the second term becomes md2. The integral in the final term is the moment about the x-axis, relative to the center of mass - which is zero by definition. So, the equation becomes:
