The similarities to the ordinary black holes in 3+1 dimensions:
It admits a no hair theorem, fully characterizing the solution by its ADM-mass, angular momentum and charge.
It has the same thermodynamical properties as traditional black hole solutions such as Schwarzschild or Kerr black holes, e.g. its entropy is captured by a law directly analogous to the Bekenstein bound in (3+1)-dimensions, essentially with the surface area replaced by the BTZ black hole's circumference.
Like the Kerr black hole, a rotating BTZ black hole contains an inner and an outer horizon, analogous to an ergosphere.
Since (2+1)-dimensional gravity has no Newtonian limit, one might fear that the BTZ black hole is not the final state of a gravitational collapse. It was however shown, that this black hole could arise from collapsing matter and we can calculate the energy-moment tensor of BTZ as same as (3+1) black holes. (Carlip 1995) section 3 Black Holes and Gravitational Collapse.
The BTZ solution is often discussed in the realm on (2+1)-dimensional quantum gravity.
