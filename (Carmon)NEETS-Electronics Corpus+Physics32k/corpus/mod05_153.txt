In a dc motor, there is always a counter emf developed. This counter emf cannot be equal to or 
greater than the applied battery voltage; if it were, the motor would not run. The counter emf is always a 
little less. However, the counter emf opposes the applied voltage enough to keep the armature current 
from the battery to a fairly low value. If there were no such thing as counter emf, much more current 
would flow through the armature, and the motor would run much faster. However, there is no way to 
avoid the counter emf.
