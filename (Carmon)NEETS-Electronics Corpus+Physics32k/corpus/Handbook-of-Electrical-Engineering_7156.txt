sub-divide a broad frequency band into a number of transponder channels. For example, the 500 MHz uplink
FSS band from 5.925 to 6.425 GHz may be divided into 12 transponder channels of 36 MHz bandwidth plus
guard  bands.  This  limits  the  interference  among  adjacent  channels  in  the  corresponding  downlink  band  of
3.7 to 4.2 GHz.
