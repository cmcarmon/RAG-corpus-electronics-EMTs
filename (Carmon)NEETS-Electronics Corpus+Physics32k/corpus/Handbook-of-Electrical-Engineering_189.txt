In addition to Standard and HRC fuses, there are many other types designed for speciﬁc applications. For
example,  there  are  medium-  or  high-voltage  fuses  to  protect  power  distribution  transformers  and  medium-
voltage motors. There are fuses used to protect sensitive semiconductor devices such as diodes, SCRs, and triacs.
These  fuses  are  designed  to  be  extremely  fast  under  short-circuit  conditions.  There  is  also  a  wide  variety  of
dedicated fuses designed for protection of speciﬁc equipment requirements such as electric welders, capacitors,
and circuit breakers, to name a few.
