Newton’s proof is complicated, in view of the simplicity of the above proof. As an example, his proof requires some deciphering, as the following sentence shows:
“And therefore, if with centre C and any radius CP or Cp a circular sector is described equal to the total area VPC which the body P revolving in an immobile orbit has described in any time by a radius drawn to the centre, the difference between the forces by which the body P in an immobile orbit and body p in a mobile orbit revolve will be to the centripetal force by which some body, by a radius drawn to the centre, would have been able to describe that sector uniformly in the same time in which the area VPC was described as G2 - F2 to F2.”
He initially regards the infinitesimal



τ


{\displaystyle \tau }
as fixed, then the areas SPQ and spq are proportional to V and v, respectively and therefore:



Q
T

S
P
∝

τ


{\displaystyle QT.SP\propto V\tau }
and



q

s

{\displaystyle qt.sp\propto v\tau }
at each of the points, P and p and:

{\displaystyle yq={\frac {qt^{2}-QT^{2}}{2sp}}\propto {\frac {1}{sp^{3}}}}
so the additional force varies inversely as the cube of the radius.
In Fig.1, XQ is a circular arc, with centre S and radius SQ, meeting SP at X. The perpendicular XY meets RQ at Y, and

{\displaystyle YQ={\frac {QT^{2}}{2SP}}}

Let

{\displaystyle \phi (SQ)}
be the force required to make a body move in a circle of radius SQ, if it has the same speed as the transverse speed of the body in the static orbit at Q.

{\displaystyle {\frac {f(SA)-F(SA)}{\phi (SA)}}={\frac {(v^{2}-V^{2})}{V^{2}}}}

But at A, Fig. 3., the ratio of the force that makes the body follow the static curve, AE, to that required to make it follow the circle, AB, with radius SA, is inversely as the ratio of their radii of curvature, since they are both moving at the same speed, V, perpendicular to SA:

{\displaystyle f(sp)-F(sp)={\frac {(f(sa)-F(sa))sa^{3}}{sp^{3}}}={\frac {\rho .F(sa)sa^{2}.(v^{2}-V^{2})}{V^{2}sp^{3}}}}

Substituting Newton’s expression for F(SA), gives the result obtained previously.
