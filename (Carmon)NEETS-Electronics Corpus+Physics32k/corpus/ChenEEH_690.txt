It is expected, however, that not much more can be gained
because the ‘‘bag of tricks’’ now contains only the more complex
solutions with a smaller return-on-investment. Note that the
combination of all these approaches indicates a very advanced
circuit technology, which still outperforms the current state-of-
the-art in data path and logic circuits for low-power design (at
least in industry). Hence, it can be expected that the relative
power in the nonstorage parts can be more drastically reduced
for the future (on condition that similar investments are done).
