using this approach on the ladder in Figure 4.9 results in the
circuit in Figure 4.19, in complete analogy with the GIC circuit
in Figure 4.11. Notice that all gm cells in the simulated ladder
are the same, a convenience for matching and design automa-
tion. The circuits in Figures 4.11 and 4.19 have identical
performance in all respects, except that the useful frequency
range of the OTA-based design is much larger. Even when
using fast ampliﬁers with, say, f t  100 MHz, the useful oper-
ating frequencies of the GIC ﬁlter in Figure 4.11 will be less
than about 10 MHz, whereas it is not difﬁcult to achieve
operation at several 100 MHz with the OTA-based circuit.
A signal-ﬂow graph method need not be discussed here be-
cause, as we stated, the resulting circuitry is identical to the one
obtained with the element replacement method.
