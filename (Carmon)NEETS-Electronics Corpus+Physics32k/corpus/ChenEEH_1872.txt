IMT-2000/UMTS is the 3G speciÔ¨Åcation under development
by the ITU that will provide enhanced voice, data, and multi-
media services over wireless networks. In its current state, the
plan is for IMT-2000 to specify a family of standards that will
provide at least a 384 kbps data rate at pedestrian speeds,
144 kbps at mobile speeds, and up to 2 Mbps in an indoor
environment. Numerous standard bodies throughout
the
world have submitted proposals to the ITU on UMTS/IMT-
2000.
