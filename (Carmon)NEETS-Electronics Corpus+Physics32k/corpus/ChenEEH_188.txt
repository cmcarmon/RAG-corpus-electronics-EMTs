The words possibly in addition LC impedance indicate that
additional terms may exist in z11 and/or z22. These are called
private impedances and do not inï¬‚uence z12. They would
appear as in Figure 4.28(A) for impedance parameters and as
in Figure 4.28(B) for admittance parameters. After their re-
moval, all zij must have the same poles, the residues of z11 and
z22 must be positive, and residues of z12 may be positive or
negative.
