Several methods are available to reduce the limitations of conventional tubes, but none work well 
when frequency increases beyond 1,000 megahertz. Interelectrode capacitance can be reduced by moving 
the electrodes further apart or by reducing the size of the tube and its electrodes. Moving the electrodes 
apart increases the problems associated with transit time, and reducing the size of the tube lowers the 
power-handling capability. You can see that efforts to reduce certain limitations in conventional tubes are 
compromises that are often in direct opposition to each other. The net effect is an upper limit of 
approximately 1,000 megahertz, beyond which conventional tubes are not practical.
