Oscilloscopes are designed to view a time-domain waveform (amplitude versus time). Spectrum 
analyzers are designed to view a frequency-domain waveform (amplitude versus frequency). One 
advantage of using a spectrum analyzer is its ability to graphically display the composition of 
COMPLEX WAVEFORMS.
