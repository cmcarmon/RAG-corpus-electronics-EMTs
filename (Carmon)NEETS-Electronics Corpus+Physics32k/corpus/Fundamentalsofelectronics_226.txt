Example 3.5
Let’s apply these results to a ﬁnal example, in which the input is a voltage source and the output
is the inductor current. The source voltage equals Vin = 2 cos (2π60t) + 3. We want the circuit to
pass constant (oﬀset) voltage essentially unaltered (save for the fact that the output is a current
rather than a voltage) and remove the 60 Hz term. Because the input is the sum of two sinusoids–a
constant is a zero-frequency cosine–our approach is
