Otto Cycle
1→2: Isentropic expansion: Constant entropy (s), Decrease in pressure (P), Increase in volume (v), Decrease in temperature (T)
2→3: Isochoric Cooling: Constant volume(v), Decrease in pressure (P), Decrease in entropy (S), Decrease in temperature (T)
3→4: Isentropic compression: Constant entropy (s), Increase in pressure (P), Decrease in volume (v), Increase in temperature (T)
4→1: Isochoric heating: Constant volume (v), Increase in pressure (P), Increase in entropy (S), Increase in temperature (T)
