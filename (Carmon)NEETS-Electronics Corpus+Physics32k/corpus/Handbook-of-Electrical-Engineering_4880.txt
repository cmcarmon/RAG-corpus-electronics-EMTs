where vl(k) is the velocity of the electron with wave vector k. Every term in the series deﬁning Jl is linear in
the applied electric ﬁeld, E, so that the conductivity tensor slm is readily obtained from Jl = slmEm [Hurd, 1972,
p. 9] This matrix equation can be inverted to give El = rlmJm. For the same geometry used in deﬁning Eq. (52.1)
