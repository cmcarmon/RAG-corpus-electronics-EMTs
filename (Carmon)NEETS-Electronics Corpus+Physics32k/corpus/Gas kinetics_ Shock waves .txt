A shock wave is a compressional force that is created by an abrupt change in fluid properties such as pressure, temperature, and density. Shockwaves can be established in two types of flows: subsonic and supersonic. The subsonic flow is adjusted by changes in the flow properties while the supersonic flow is the adjusted through the change of the presence of an object.
