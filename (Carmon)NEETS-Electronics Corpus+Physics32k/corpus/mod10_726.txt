Although we do not usually discuss the gain of a flashlight, we can continue the comparison of an 
antenna and a flashlight to explain the meaning of antenna gain. Suppose the spot on the wall in front of 
the flashlight becomes 10 times brighter than it was when only the open bulb was used. The lens and 
reflector have then produced a 10-fold gain in light. For antennas, the simple half-wave antenna 
corresponds to the open bulb in the flashlight. Suppose an antenna system concentrates the radio waves so
