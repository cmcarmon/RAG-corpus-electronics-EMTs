Finally, for both the dependent current source and the dependent voltage
source it is once again important to distinguish between the symbols that define
them (e.g., g) and the branch variables that are defined (e.g., vIN, iIN, vOUT, and
iOUT) in order to express their element laws. In particular, the branch variable
definitions may be reversed for convenience, which will lead to a negation of
the corresponding element laws.
