Some basic hypotheses are made in order to give a precise conceptual framework to the shell model:
The atomic nucleus is a quantum n-body system.
The internal motion of nucleons within the nucleus is non-relativistic, and their behavior is governed by the Schr√∂dinger equation.
Nucleons are considered to be pointlike, without any internal structure.
