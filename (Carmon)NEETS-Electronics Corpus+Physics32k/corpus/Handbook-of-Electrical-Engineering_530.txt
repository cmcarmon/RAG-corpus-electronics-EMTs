Reverse voltage applied to the diode causes a small leakage current (negative according to the sign convention)
to ﬂow that is typically orders of magnitude lower than current in the forward direction. The diode can withstand
reverse  voltages  up  to  a  limit  determined  by  its  physical  construction  and  the  semiconductor  material  used.
Beyond this value the reverse voltage imparts enough energy to the charge carriers to cause large increases in
current.  The  mechanisms  by  which  this  current  increase  occurs  are  impact  ionization  (avalanche)  [McKay,
1954] and a tunneling phenomenon (Zener breakdown) [Moll, 1964]. Avalanche breakdown results in large
power dissipation in the diode, is generally destructive, and should be avoided at all times. Both breakdown
regions are superimposed in Fig. 5.2 for comparison of their effects on the shape of the diode characteristic
curve. Avalanche breakdown occurs for reverse applied voltages in the range of volts to kilovolts depending on
the exact design of the diode. Zener breakdown occurs at much lower voltages than the avalanche mechanism.
Diodes speciﬁcally designed to operate in the Zener breakdown mode are used extensively as voltage regulators
in regulator integrated circuits and as discrete components in large regulated power supplies.
