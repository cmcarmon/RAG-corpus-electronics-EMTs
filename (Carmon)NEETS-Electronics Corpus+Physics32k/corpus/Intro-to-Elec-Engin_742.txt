All ampliﬁers exhibit variations of performance as the signal frequency is changed. The frequency
response of an ampliﬁer may be deﬁned as the functional dependence of output amplitude and
phase upon frequency, for all frequencies. Invariably there is a maximum frequency above which
ampliﬁcation does not occur. Depending on the design of the circuit, there may also be a lower
frequency limit below which ampliﬁcation disappears. The range of frequencies over which
signiﬁcant ampliﬁcation of the magnitude is obtained is known as the passband, which is bounded
by the upper cutoff frequency and the lower cutoff frequency (if one exists). Dc-coupled ampliﬁers,
in which the stages are coupled together for all frequencies down to zero, have no low-frequency
limit. On the other hand, circuits containing coupling capacitors that couple stages together for
