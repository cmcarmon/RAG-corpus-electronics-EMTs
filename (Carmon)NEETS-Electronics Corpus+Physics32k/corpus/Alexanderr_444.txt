enters pin 1, the inductor is rotated three times before it is placed in
i(t)
the  circuit.  The  same  applies  for  the  capacitor.  We  insert  pseudo-
components VIEWPOINT and IPROBE to determine the initial capacitor
voltage and initial inductor current. We carry out a dc PSpice analysis
by  selecting  Analysis/Simulate. As  shown  in  Fig.  8.41(a),  we  obtain
the initial capacitor voltage as 0 V and the initial inductor current 
i(0)
as  4 A from  the  dc  analysis.  These  initial  values  will  be  used  in  the
transient analysis.
