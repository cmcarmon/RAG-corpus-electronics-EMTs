T is the diode’s temperature in K. At room temperature, the ratio kT
= 25 mV. The constant I0 is the
q
leakage current, and is usually very small. Viewing this v-i relation in Figure 3.46, the nonlinearity becomes
obvious. When the voltage is positive, current ﬂows easily through the diode. This situation is known as
forward biasing. When we apply a negative voltage, the current is quite small, and equals I0, known as
the leakage or reverse-bias current. A less detailed model for the diode has any positive current ﬂowing
through the diode when it is forward biased, and no current when negative biased. Note that the diode’s
schematic symbol looks like an arrowhead; the direction of current ﬂow corresponds to the direction the
arrowhead points.
