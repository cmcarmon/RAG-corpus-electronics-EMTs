formers. Both are used to secure information about the con-
dition and operation of the system. Typically, this information
is used in relaying information and in operational control of
the system. The current transformer is a series transformer. Its
primary winding is connected in series with the circuit in
which the current is to be measured, and the secondary
winding supplies a current output that is proportional to the
primary current (Figure 3.5). The voltage transformer primary
winding is connected to the terminals of the circuit where the
voltage is to be measured, and the secondary winding supplies
a voltage proportional to the primary voltage.
