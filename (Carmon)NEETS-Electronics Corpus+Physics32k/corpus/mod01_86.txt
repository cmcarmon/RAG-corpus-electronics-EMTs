The electrical conductivity of matter is dependent upon the atomic structure of the material from
which the conductor is made. In any solid material, such as copper, the atoms which make up the
molecular structure are bound firmly together. At room temperature, copper will contain a considerable
amount of heat energy. Since heat energy is one method of removing electrons from their orbits, copper
will contain many free electrons that can move from atom to atom. When not under the influence of an
external force, these electrons move in a haphazard manner within the conductor. This movement is equal
in all directions so that electrons are not lost or gained by any part of the conductor. When controlled by
an external force, the electrons move generally in the same direction. The effect of this movement is felt
almost instantly from one end of the conductor to the other. This electron movement is called an
ELECTRIC CURRENT.
