One problem lies in the size of time units created using metric prefixes. The International System of Units has developed prefixes to express units as exponential multiples or sub-multiples. The first three multiples would be viable for use within a metric time system; they are:
However, the next multiples are:
Such lengths of time are relatively impractical for measuring human activities.
For decimal multiples of the metric time unit to be practical, standard units and prefixes would need to be developed or revived for the 4th and 5th exponents so that it becomes viable for measuring human life. Historically, the metric system included a myria- prefix to represent 104 (and a counterpart dimi- prefix for 10âˆ’4), but SI (introduced in 1960) omitted the prefixes and prohibited using multiple prefixes such as decahecto-, a workaround also in use prior to the SI, leaving no way to name those orders of magnitude. 105 was represented using various ad hoc solutions; 100 000 meters composed a grade, 100 000 pascals composed a bar, and 100 000 dynes composed a newton; most of these conversions stem from compatible units that were used in the SI (and its predecessor, MKS) and the CGS system of units. Meteorologists currently use a unit of 100 000 seconds (a quantity on the order of a day) to quantify atmospheric vorticity at the synoptic scale; the unit, however, does not have a formal name.
The only way to express a nonstandard order of magnitude as an SI unit is to combine two prefixed SI derived units whose component base units cancel out; for example, units of 105 seconds could be expressed as kilojoules per centiwatt (kJ/cW) or hectocoulombs per milliampere (hC/mA). Such misuse of SI derived units can create a cognitive dissonance; to do so requires the invocation of units not directly related to the quantity being measured (coulombs and amperes, for example, quantify electricity, making it awkward to combine the two in a way that creates a unit of time with no electrical component).
