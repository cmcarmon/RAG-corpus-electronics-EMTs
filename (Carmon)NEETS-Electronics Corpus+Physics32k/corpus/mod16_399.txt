The wattmeter consists of two circuits, either of which will be damaged if too much current passes
through them. You should be especially aware of this fact because the reading on the instrument will not
tell you whether or not the coils are being overheated. If an ammeter or voltmeter is overloaded, the
pointer will indicate beyond the upper limit of its scale. In the wattmeter, both the current and potential
circuit may carry such an overload that their insulations burn; yet the pointer may be only part of the way
up the scale. This is because the position of the pointer depends upon the power factor of the circuit as
well as upon the voltage and current. Therefore, a low power-factor circuit will provide a very low
reading on the wattmeter. The reading will be low, even when the current and voltage circuits are loaded
to the maximum safe limit. The safe rating for each wattmeter is always distinctly rated, not in watts, but
in volts and amperes.
