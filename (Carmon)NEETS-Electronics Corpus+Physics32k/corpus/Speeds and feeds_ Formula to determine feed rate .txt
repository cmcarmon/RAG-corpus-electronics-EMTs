This formula can be used to figure out the feed rate that the cutter travels into or around the work. This would apply to cutters on a milling machine, drill press and a number of other machine tools. This is not to be used on the lathe for turning operations, as the feed rate on a lathe is given as feed per revolution.

{\displaystyle FR={RPM\times T\times CL}}

Where:
FR = the calculated feed rate in inches per minute or mm per minute.
RPM = is the calculated speed for the cutter.
T = Number of teeth on the cutter.
CL = The chip load or feed per tooth. This is the size of chip that each tooth of the cutter takes.
