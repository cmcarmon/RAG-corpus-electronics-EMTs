All of these symbols are expressed using capital letters, except in cases where a quantity
(especially voltage or current) is described in terms of a brief period of time (called an ”instan-
taneous” value). For example, the voltage of a battery, which is stable over a long period of
time, will be symbolized with a capital letter ”E,” while the voltage peak of a lightning strike
at the very instant it hits a power line would most likely be symbolized with a lower-case letter
”e” (or lower-case ”v”) to designate that value as being at a single moment in time. This same
lower-case convention holds true for current as well, the lower-case letter ”i” representing cur-
rent at some instant in time. Most direct-current (DC) measurements, however, being stable
over time, will be symbolized with capital letters.
