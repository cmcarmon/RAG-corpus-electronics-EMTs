The most troublesome and frustrating problem in receiving radio signals is variations in signal 
strength, most commonly known as FADING. There are several conditions that can produce fading. 
When a radio wave is refracted by the ionosphere or reflected from the Earth's surface, random changes in 
the polarization of the wave may occur. Vertically and horizontally mounted receiving antennas are 
designed to receive vertically and horizontally polarized waves, respectively. Therefore, changes in 
polarization cause changes in the received signal level because of the inability of the antenna to receive 
polarization changes.
