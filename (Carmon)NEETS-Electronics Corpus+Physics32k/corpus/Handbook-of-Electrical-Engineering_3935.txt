Another type of noncontacting feed is the aperture-coupled microstrip antenna shown in Fig. 38.19c [James
and Hall, 1989; Pozar and Schaubert, 1995]. This conÔ¨Åguration consists of two parallel substrates separated by
a  ground  plane.  A  microstrip  feed  line  on  the  bottom  of  the  bottom  substrate  is  coupled  through  a  small
aperture (typically a thin slot) in the ground plane to a microstrip patch element on the top of the top substrate.
This arrangement allows a thin, high-dielectric-constant substrate to be used for the feed line, and a thicker,
low-dielectric-constant substrate to be used for the radiating element. In this way, the two-layer design of the
aperture-coupled element allows the substrates to be optimized for the distinct functions of circuit components
and radiating elements. In addition, the ground plane provides isolation between the radiating aperture and
possible spurious radiation or coupling from the feed network. An important aspect of the aperture-coupled
approach is that the coupling aperture is below resonant size, so that the backlobe radiated by the slot is typically
15 to 20 dB below the main forward beam.
