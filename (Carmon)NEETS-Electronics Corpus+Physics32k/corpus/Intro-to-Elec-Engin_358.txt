Residential electric power service commonly consists of a three-wire ac system supplied by the
local power company. A distribution transformer with a primary and two secondaries formed with
a center tap on the secondary side, as illustrated in Figure 4.4.1, is located on a utility pole, from
which three wires originate. Two of them are known as “hot” wires, while the third is called a
neutral wire, which is connected to earth ground. In accordance with standard insulation color
codes, “hot” wires are denoted by either B (black) or R (red), neutral by W (white), and ground
(or uninsulated wire) by G (green). The functional difference between neutral and ground wires
will be brought out later when considering circuit wiring.
