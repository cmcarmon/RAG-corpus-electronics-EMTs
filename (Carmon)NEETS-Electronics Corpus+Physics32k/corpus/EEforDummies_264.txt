In this section, you take a closer 
look at fixed and variable resistors. 
Figure 5­8 shows the circuit symbols 
that are commonly used to repre­
sent fixed resistors, potentiometers, 
and another type of variable resistor 
called a rheostat. (See the sidebar 
“Recognizing rheostats,” later in this chapter.) The zigzag pattern should 
remind you that resistors make it more difficult for current to pass through, 
just as a kink in a hose makes it more difficult for water to pass through.
