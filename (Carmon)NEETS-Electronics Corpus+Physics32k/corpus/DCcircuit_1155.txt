Because this is a unit of area measurement, the mathematical power of 2 is still in effect
(doubling the width of a circle will always quadruple its area, no matter what units are used,
or if the width of that circle is expressed in terms of radius or diameter). To illustrate the
difference between measurements in square mils and measurements in circular mils, I will
compare a circle with a square, showing the area of each shape in both unit measures:
