Array of Dependent Cells
The FT designs for linearly connected dependent cells can be
obtained by some simple modiﬁcations to the designs for
independent cells presented in the previous paragraphs. Essen-
tially, the fact that the original inputs of all cells are not
available at the same time differentiates between arrays of
independent and dependent cells.
