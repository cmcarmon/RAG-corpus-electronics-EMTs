This expression shows that the readback voltage induced in the recording head is linearly dependent upon
the magnitude of the magnetization in the recording medium being sensed and the relative head-to-medium
velocity. The linearity of the readback process ensures that analog recordings such as those recorded on audio
or video tapes are faithfully reproduced.
