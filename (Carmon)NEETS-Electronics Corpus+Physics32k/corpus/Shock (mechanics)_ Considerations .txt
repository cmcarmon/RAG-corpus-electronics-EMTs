When laboratory testing, field experience, or engineering judgement indicates that an item could be damaged by mechanical shock, several courses of action might be considered:
Reduce and control the input shock at the source.
Modify the item to improve its toughness or support it to better handle shocks.
Use shock absorbers or cushions to control the shock transmitted to the item. Cushioning  reduces the peak acceleration by extending the duration of the shock.
Plan for failures: accept certain losses. Have redundant systems available, etc.
