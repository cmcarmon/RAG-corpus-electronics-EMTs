The product of pulse width (pw) and pulse-repetition frequency (prf) in the above formula is called
the DUTY CYCLE of a radar system. The duty cycle is a ratio of the time on to the time off of the
transmitter, as shown in figure 1-6. The duty cycle is used to calculate both the peak power and average
power of a radar system. The formula for duty cycle is shown below:
