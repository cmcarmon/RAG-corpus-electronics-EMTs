Note that the terms, circuit and graph, are used throughout
the rest of this chapter interchangeably to denote the same
fully synchronous digital circuit. In addition, note that for
brevity, the superscript C, when referring to the circuit graph
GC of a circuit C, is omitted unless a circuit is explicitly
indicated. The terms, register and vertex, are also used inter-
changeably as are edge, local data path, arc, and a sequentially
adjacent pair of registers. On a Ô¨Ånal note, it is assumed that the
graph of any circuit considered here is connected. If this is not
the case, each of the disjoint connected portions of the graph
(circuit) can be individually analyzed.
