	
I	 want	 to	 thank	 you	 and	 congratulate	 you	 for	 downloading	 the	 book,	 Circuit
Engineering:	The	Beginner’s	Guide	to	Electronic	Circuits,	Semi-Conductors,	Circuit
Boards,	and	Basic	Electronics.
This	book	contains	a	beginner’s	course	on	circuit	engineering.	Here,	the	basics	of	electric
and	 electronic	 circuits	 are	 discussed.	 You	 will	 grasp	 the	 definitions	 of	 circuits,	 semi-
conductors,	resistors,	inductors,	transformers,	circuit	boards,	and	electronics,	in	general.
You’ll	even	be	introduced	to	electrical	safety	tips	and	a	set	of	skills	needed	in	electronics,
as	well	as	a	short	take	on	reverse	engineering,	hacking,	microcontroller	programming,	and
robotics.
Alongside,	you	can	apply	all	that	you’ll	be	learning	once	you	get	started	with	the	proposed
circuit	 projects	 for	 beginner.	 You’ll	 also	 be	 rewarded	 a	 peek	 at	 different	 career-
advancement	possibilities.	While	reading	about	the	fundamentals	and	various	theories	in
the	 subject	 is	 important,	 hands-on	 learning	 is	 equally	 important.	 This	 way,	 you	 can	 put
your	newly	gathered	knowledge	to	good	use.
If	 you’re	 uncertain	 whether	 or	 not	 you	 have	 what	 it	 takes	 to	 learn	 the	 ropes	 in	 circuit
engineering,	let	this	book	help	you	decide.	Chances	are,	you	have	the	stamina	for	the	field
and	for	all	you	know,	you	can	discover	a	new	passion	for	circuits	and	electronic	devices.
Thanks	again	for	downloading	this	book;	I	hope	you	enjoy	it!
