Classical compensator design procedures are based on the open-loop function Gp(s)H(s) of Fig. 100.28. It is
common to present modern design procedures as being based on only the plant model of (100.68). However,
the  models  of  the  sensors  that  measure  the  signals  for  feedback  must  be  included  in  the  state  model.  This
problem will become more evident as the modern procedures are presented.
