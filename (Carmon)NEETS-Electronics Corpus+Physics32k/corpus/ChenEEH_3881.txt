MPEG-21 speciﬁes an XML Schema-based language for de-
scribing media resource adaptability, user environment, and
other concepts related to adapting and conﬁguring digital
items and adapting media resources to user environments.
While MPEG-7 has an important role in describing media
resource adaptability, user preferences, and controlled terms,
MPEG-21 further describes media resource adaptability, usage
environment, and adaptation rights. MPEG-21 is also investi-
gating a language for describing and manipulating bit streams
(BSDL).
