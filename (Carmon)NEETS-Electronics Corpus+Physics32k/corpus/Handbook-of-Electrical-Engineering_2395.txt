Clearly,  the  simple  relationships  given  above  will  not  hold  for  the  nonrectangular  shapes  shown  in
Fig. 22.35(c)–(f), several of which are very popular. Fortunately, van der Pauw [1958] has solved the potential
problem for a thin layer of arbitrary shape. One of the convenient features of the van der Pauw formulation is
that  no  dimension  need  be  measured  for  the  calculation  of  sheet  resistance  or  sheet  carrier  concentration,
although a thickness must of course be known for volume resistivity and concentration. Basically, the validity
of the van der Pauw method requires that the sample be ﬂat, homogeneous, and isotropic, a singly connected
domain (no holes), and have line electrodes on the periphery, projecting to point contacts on the surface, or
else have true point contacts on the surface. The last requirement is the most difﬁcult to satisfy, so that much
work has gone into determining the effects of ﬁnite contact size.
