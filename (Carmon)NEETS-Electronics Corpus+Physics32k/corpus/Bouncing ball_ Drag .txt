Air flow around the ball can be either laminar or turbulent depending on the Reynolds number (Re), defined as:





Re

ρ
D
v

μ


,


{\displaystyle {\text{Re}}={\frac {\rho Dv}{\mu }},}

where ρ is the density of air, μ the dynamic viscosity of air, D the diameter of the ball, and v the velocity of the ball through air. At a temperature of 20 °C, ρ = 1.2 kg/m3 and μ = 1.8×10−5 Pa·s.
If the Reynolds number is very low (Re < 1), the drag force on the ball is described by Stokes' law:

{\displaystyle F_{\text{D}}=6\pi \mu rv,}

where r is the radius of the ball. This force acts in opposition to the ball's direction (in the direction of

). For most sports balls, however, the Reynolds number will be between 104 and 105 and Stokes' law does not apply. At these higher values of the Reynolds number, the drag force on the ball is instead described by the drag equation:

{\displaystyle F_{\text{D}}={\frac {1}{2}}\rho C_{\text{d}}Av^{2},}

where Cd is the drag coefficient, and A the cross-sectional area of the ball.
Drag will cause the ball to lose mechanical energy during its flight, and will reduce the range and the height of a ball, while crosswinds will deflect it from its original path. Both effects have to be taken into account by players in sports such as golf.
