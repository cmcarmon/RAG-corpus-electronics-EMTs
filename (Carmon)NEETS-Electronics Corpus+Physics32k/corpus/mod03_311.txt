To select the proper fuse, you must know the normal operating current of the circuit. If you wish to
protect the circuit from overloads (excessive current), select a fuse rated at 125 percent of the normal
circuit current. In other words, if a circuit has a normal current of 10 amperes, a 12.5-ampere fuse will
provide overload protection. If you wish to protect against direct shorts only, select a fuse rated at 150
percent of the normal circuit current. In the case of a circuit with 10 amperes of current, a 15 ampere fuse
will protect against direct shorts, but will not be adequate protection against excessive current.
