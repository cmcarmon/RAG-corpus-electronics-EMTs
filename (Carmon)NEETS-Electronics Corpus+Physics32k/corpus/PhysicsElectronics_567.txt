The op-amp is constructed from several transistor stages, which commonly include a
diﬀerential-input stage, an intermediate-gain stage and a push-pull output stage. The dif-
ferential ampliﬁer consists of a matched pair of bipolar transistors or FETs. The push-pull
ampliﬁer transmits a large current to the load and hence has a small output impedance.
