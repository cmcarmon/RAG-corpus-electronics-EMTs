Consider, as shown in Figure 2.7(A), the two nodes vn (the
noise aggressor or source) and vv (the noise victim) that are
coupled by a capacitor Cc. Node vv is also tied to ground
through a generic admittance Y. In digital circuits, vv can be
either a ﬂoating node (such as found in dynamic logic, pass
transistor logic, or memory cells) or a driven node (such as
found in static logic). The admittance Y is therefore equivalent
to either a second coupling capacitance Cp (from the ﬂoating
node to the ground plane) or a resistance ra (representing the
output impedance of the gate driving the node). Both cases are
illustrated in Figure 2.7.
