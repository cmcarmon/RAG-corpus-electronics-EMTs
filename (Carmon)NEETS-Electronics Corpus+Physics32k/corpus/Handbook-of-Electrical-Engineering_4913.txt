  over  which  electromagnetic  Ô¨Åelds  can
change  inside  a  superconductor.  This  penetration  depth  is  different  from  the  more  familiar  skin  depth  of
electromagnetic theory, the latter being a frequency-dependent quantity. Indeed, the penetration depth at zero
temperature is a distinct material property of a particular superconductor.
