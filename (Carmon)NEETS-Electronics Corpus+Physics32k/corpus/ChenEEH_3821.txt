In Figure 4.12(A), we see an image contaminated with
periodic noise. Figure 4.12(B) shows the DFT of this image.
One can clearly see the periodic noise as two well-deÔ¨Åned
points on the DFT of the image. For convenience, arrows are
pointing to them. In Figure 4.12(C), one can see the DFT of
the image with the periodic noise removed; the frequency
locations corresponding to the periodic noise were made
equal to zero. Figure 4.12(D) shows the inverse DFT of the
image in Figure 4.12(C). One can notice that the noise has
been effectively removed, improving the quality of the image
a great deal.
