At this time we have one equation with two unknowns. To be able to solve for two unknown
mesh currents, we must have two equations. If we trace the other loop of the circuit, we can
obtain another KVL equation and have enough data to solve for the two currents. Creature
of habit that I am, Iâ€™ll start at the upper-left hand corner of the right loop and trace counter-
clockwise:
