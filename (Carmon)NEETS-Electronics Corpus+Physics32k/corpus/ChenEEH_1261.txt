. Caches are the areas of high-speed memory used to store
frequently used data and instructions. Caches allow the
CPU to access instructions and data much quicker than if
it were to access the data from the main memory. In a
nutshell, cache memory works as follows: if the CPU
requests a memory access, the memory management
unit (MMU) ﬁrst checks to see if the requested address
is in the caches. If the address is in the caches, the data are
returned to the CPU (in case of a read request) or up-
dated in the cache (in case of a write request). On the
other hand, if the address is not in the cache, the contents
of that address (and perhaps its neighbor) must be
brought into the cache from the main memory. In today’s
system, there are often multiple levels of cache memory.
For example, Intel’s Pentium II uses two levels of cache. In
level 1, separate instruction and data caches are used and
each with a 16-KB capacity. In level 2, 512 KB of uniﬁed
