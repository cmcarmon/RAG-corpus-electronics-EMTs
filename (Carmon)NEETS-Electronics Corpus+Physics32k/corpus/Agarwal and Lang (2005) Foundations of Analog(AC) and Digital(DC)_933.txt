However, there are other situations demanding higher drain voltages in
which we wish to use the MOSFET in an ON state. The SR model of the
MOSFET is inappropriate in this region. This section will first show why the SR
model is inadequate when vDS ≥ vGS−VT. We will then take a look at the actual
MOSFET characteristics and then explore the possibility of creating a simple
piecewise-linear model for the MOSFET in the region where vDS ≥ vGS − VT.
We will use the setup shown in Figure 7.7 to observe the actual MOSFET
characteristics. Let us start by applying a fixed, high gate-to-source voltage
such that
