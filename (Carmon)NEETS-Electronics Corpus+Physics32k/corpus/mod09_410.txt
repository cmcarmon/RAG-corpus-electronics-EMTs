So far, the basic flip-flop has used only pnp transistors. It could have just as easily used npn 
transistors. The functional operation would not change; only the polarities required for conduction and 
cutoff change. As a technician, you may see either type of transistor used, npn or pnp. A symbolic block 
diagram is sometimes used to avoid confusion about voltage polarities.
