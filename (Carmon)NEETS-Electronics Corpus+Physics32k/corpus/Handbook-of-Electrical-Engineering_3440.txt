Motivation
In the thermal control of microelectronic components, it is necessary to provide an acceptable 
 for
a diversity of devices and packages, which vary widely in size, power dissipation, and sensitivity to temperature.
Although the 
of all electronic components is motivated by a common set of concerns,
this diversity often leads to the design and development of distinct thermal control systems for different types
of electronic equipment. Moreover, due to substantial variations in the performance, cost, and environmental
speciÔ¨Åcations across product categories, the thermal control of similar components may require widely differing
thermal management strategies.
