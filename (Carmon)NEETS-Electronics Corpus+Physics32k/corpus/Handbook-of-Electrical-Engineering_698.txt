it is possible to decompose the expansion’s elementary transform functions into causal and anticausal functions
(and possibly impulse-generated terms). Any elementary function is interpreted as being (1) causal if the real
component of its pole is less than or equal to s+ and (2) anticausal if the real component of its pole is greater
than or equal to s–.
