Speech Recognition System Architecture
Figure 15.15  shows  a  block  diagram  of  a  speech  recognition  system.  Speech  is  typically  input  to  the  system
using an analog transducer, such as a microphone, and converted to digital form. Signal pre-processing consists
of computing a sequence of acoustic feature vectors by processing the speech samples in successive time intervals.
In  some  systems,  a  clustering  technique  known  as  vector  quantization  is  used  to  convert  these  continuous-
valued features to a sequence of discrete codewords drawn from a codebook of acoustic prototypes. Recognition
of an unknown utterance involves transforming the sequence of feature vectors, or codewords, into an appro-
priate message. The recognition process is typically constrained by a set of acoustic models which correspond
to the basic units of speech employed in the recognizer, a lexicon which deÔ¨Ånes the vocabulary of the recognizer
