Besides puncturing of the tire a flat can be caused by: failure of or damage to the valve stem; rubbing of the tire against the road, ripping the tire, or separation of tire and rim by collision with another object; excessive wear of the tire tread allowing explosive tire failure or allowing road debris to tear through it.
Some tires, particularly those with a slow leak, can be repaired and re-inflated; others, especially those with worn tread, must be replaced.
