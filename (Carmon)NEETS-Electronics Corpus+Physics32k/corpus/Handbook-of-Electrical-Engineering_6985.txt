Sources of Error
Exact interpolation using the cardinal series assumes that (1) the values of the samples are known exactly, (2) the
sample locations are known exactly, and (3) an inﬁnite number of terms are used in the series. Deviation from
these requirements results in interpolation error due to (1) data noise, (2) jitter, and (3) truncation, respectively.
The  effect  of  data  error  on  the  restoration  can  be  signiﬁcant.  Some  innocently  appearing  sampling  theorem
generalizations, when subjected to performance analysis in the presence of data error, are revealed as ill-posed.
In other words, a bounded error on the data can result in unbounded error on the restoration [Marks, 1991].
