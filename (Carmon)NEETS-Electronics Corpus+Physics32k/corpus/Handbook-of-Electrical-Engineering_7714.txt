Turning  to  supercomputer  I/O  systems,  we  will  now  examine  the  I/O  architecture  of  the  Cray  machines.
Because the Cray I/O system (IOS) varies from model to model, the following discussion concentrates on the
IOS found on the Cray X-MP and Y-MP [Cray, 1988]. In general, the IOS consists of two to four I/O processors
(IOPs), each with its own local memory and sharing a common buffer memory with the other IOPs. The IOP
is designed to be a simple, fast machine for controlling data transfers between devices and the central memory
of the Cray main processors. Since it executes the control statements of an I/O program, it is not unlike the
IBM channel processor in terms of its functionality, except that IO programs reside in its local memory rather
than in the host’s. An IOP’s local memory is connected through a high-speed communications interface, called
a channel in Cray terminology, to a disk control unit (DCU). A given port into the local memory can be time
multiplexed  among  multiple  channels.  Data  is  transferred  back  and  forth  between  devices  and  the  main
processors  through  the  IOP’s  local  memory,  which  is  interfaced  to  central  memory  through  a  100-Mbyte/s
channel pair (one pathway for each direction of transfer).
