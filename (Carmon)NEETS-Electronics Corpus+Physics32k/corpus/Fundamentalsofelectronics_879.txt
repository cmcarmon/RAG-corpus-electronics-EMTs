6.24 Channel Coding32
We can, to some extent, correct errors made by the receiver with only the error-ﬁlled bit stream emerging
from the digital channel available to us. The idea is for the transmitter to send not only the symbol-derived
bits emerging from the source coder but also additional bits derived from the coder’s bit stream. These
additional bits, the error correcting bits, help the receiver determine if an error has occurred in the
data bits (the important bits) or in the error-correction bits. Instead of the communication model shown
previously (Figure 6.17), the transmitter inserts a channel coder before analog modulation, and the receiver
the corresponding channel decoder (Figure 6.20). This block diagram shown there forms the Fundamental
Model of Digital Communication.
