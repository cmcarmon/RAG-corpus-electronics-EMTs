Magnetic actuation is not limited to the use of Lorentz force to cause a mechanical displacement. Magnetostrictive actuators can also use the theory of magnetism to bring about displacement. Materials that change their shapes when exposed to magnetic fields can now be used to drive high-reliability linear motors and actuators..
An example is a nickel rod that tends to deform when it is placed in an external magnetic field. Another example is wrapping a series of electromagnetic induction coils around a metal tube in which a Terfenol-D material is placed. The coils generate a moving magnetic field that courses wavelike down the successive windings along the stator tube. As the traveling magnetic field causes each succeeding cross section of Terfenol-D to elongate, then contract when the field is removed, the rod will actually "crawl" down the stator tube like an inchworm. Repeated propagating waves of magnetic flux will translate the rod down the tube's length, producing a useful stroke and force output. The amount of motion generated by the material is proportional to the magnetic field provided by the coil system, which is a function of the electric current. This type of motive device, which features a single moving part, is called an elastic-wave or peristaltic linear motor. (view: Video of a Magnetostrictive micro walker)
