Linearity and Superposition
Linearity
Consider a system (which may consist of a single network element) represented by a block, as shown in Fig. 3.11,
and observe that the system has an input designated by e (for excitation) and an output designated by r (for
response). The system is considered to be linear if it satisÔ¨Åes the homogeneity and superposition conditions.
