As observed in Equation 12.1 we have chosen to use two separate sym-
bols for the same voltage. Those symbols are v and vC. We have done this
to distinguish between the node voltage v and the branch voltage vC, which
happen to be the same. In the future, for simplicity in such cases we will use
only one symbol.
