Telemetry can also determine water levels and ﬂow rates of rivers to provide vital data for ﬂood control or
for  efﬁcient  hydroelectric  power  generation.  Data  on  the  potential  watershed  into  rivers  can  be  obtained  by
analyzing the water content of snow that would eventually melt and feed them. One requirement is to measure
the depth and water content of snow in the mountains, then transmit these data from remote points to a central
receiving station. The snow-measuring transducer may consist of a radioactive source atop a tall pole and a
radiation intensity meter on the ground beneath the snow. The gamma-ray intensity reaching the meter is a
function  of  the  height  and  water  content  of  the  intervening  snow.  Both  the  meter  and  the  transmitting
equipment can be powered by a storage battery and controlled by a clock timer that sets the time of transmission
to a few seconds per day.
