The following are examples of commonly used logarithmic scales, where a larger quantity results in a higher value:
Richter magnitude scale and moment magnitude scale (MMS) for strength of earthquakes and movement in the earth
bel and decibel for acoustic power (loudness)
neper for amplitude, field and power quantities
cent, minor second, major second, and octave for the relative pitch of notes in music
logit for odds in statistics
Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale
logarithmic timeline
counting f-stops for ratios of photographic exposure
the rule of 'nines' used for rating low probabilities
entropy in thermodynamics
information in information theory
particle-size-distribution curves of soil
The following are examples of commonly used logarithmic scales, where a larger quantity results in a lower (or negative) value:
pH for acidity
stellar magnitude scale for brightness of stars
Krumbein scale for particle size in geology
absorbance of light by transparent samples
Some of our senses operate in a logarithmic fashion (Weberâ€“Fechner law), which makes logarithmic scales for these input quantities especially appropriate. In particular our sense of hearing perceives equal ratios of frequencies as equal differences in pitch. In addition, studies of young children in an isolated tribe have shown logarithmic scales to be the most natural display of numbers in some cultures. It can also be used for geographical purposes like for measuring the speed of earthquakes.
