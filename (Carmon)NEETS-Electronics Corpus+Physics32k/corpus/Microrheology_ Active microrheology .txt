Active microrheology may use a magnetic field ,  optical tweezers    and Atomic force microscope to apply a force on the tracer and then find the stress/strain relation.
The force applied is a sinusoidal force with amplitude A and frequency ω -




F
=
A
s
i
n
(
ω
t
)


{\displaystyle F=Asin(\omega t)}

The response of the tracer is a factor of the matrix visco-elastic nature. If a matrix is totally elastic (a solid), the response to the acting force should be immediate and the tracers should be observed moving by-

)


{\displaystyle X_{e}=Bsin(\omega t)}
.
with



A

B
=
G
(

{\displaystyle A/B=G(\omega )}
.
On the other hand, if the matrix is totally viscus (a liquid), there should be a phase shift of




90

o




{\displaystyle 90^{o}}
between the strain and the stress -

)
=
B
c
o
s
(
ω

)


{\displaystyle X_{v}=Bsin(\omega t+90^{o})=Bcos(\omega t)}

in reality, as most materials are visco-elastic, the phase shift observed is



0
<
φ
<
90


{\displaystyle 0<\varphi <90}
.
When φ>45 the matrix is considered mostly in its "viscus domain" and when φ<45 the matrix is considered mostly in its "elastic domain".
Given a measured response phase shift φ (sometimes noted as δ), this ratio applies:

{\displaystyle {\frac {G''}{G'}}={\frac {{\frac {A}{B}}sin(\varphi )}{{\frac {A}{B}}cos(\varphi )}}=tan(\varphi )}

Similar response phase analysis is used in regular rheology testing.
More recently, it has been developed into Force spectrum microscopy to measure contributions of random active motor proteins to diffusive motion in the cytoskeleton.
