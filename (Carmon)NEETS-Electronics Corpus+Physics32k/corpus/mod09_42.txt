If you realize that XL and XC can be equal ONLY at ONE FREQUENCY (the resonant frequency), 
then you will have learned the most important single fact about resonant circuits. This fact is the principle 
that enables tuned circuits in the radio receiver to select one particular frequency and reject all others. 
This is the reason why so much emphasis is placed on XL and X C in the discussions that follow.
