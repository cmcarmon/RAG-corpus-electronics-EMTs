Thus the output conductance is the sum of three conductances. The first term
is the effect of the feedback, the second term is the output conductance of the
Op Amp alone, and the third term in resistance notation is Rf + Rs, hence is
the effect of the feedback resistors in the absence of the Op Amp. For large
A, this last term is not important, so the Th√©venin output conductance with
