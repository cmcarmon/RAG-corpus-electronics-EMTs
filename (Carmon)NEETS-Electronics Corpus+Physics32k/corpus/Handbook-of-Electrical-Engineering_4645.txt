A 
also called a Rayleigh wave, is composed of a coupled compressional and shear
wave in which the SAW energy is conﬁned near the surface. There is also an associated electrostatic wave for
a SAW on a piezoelectric substrate which allows electroacoustic coupling via a transducer. SAW technology’s
two key advantages are its ability to electroacoustically access and tap the wave at the crystal surface and that
the wave velocity is approximately 100,000 times slower than an electromagnetic wave. Assuming an electro-
magnetic wave velocity of 3
 m/s, Table 47.1 compares relative
dimensions  versus  frequency  and  delay.  The  SAW  wavelength  is  on  the  same  order  of  magnitude  as  line
dimensions which can be photolithographically produced and the lengths for both small and long delays are
achievable on reasonable size substrates. The corresponding E&M transmission lines or waveguides would be
impractical at these frequencies.
