HYBRID CIRCUITâ€”A circuit where passive components (resistors, capacitors) are deposited onto a
substrate made of glass, ceramic, or other insulating material. Then the active components (diodes,
transistors) are attached to the substrate and connected to the passive components on the substrate
with a very fine wire.
