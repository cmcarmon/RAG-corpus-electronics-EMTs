In  Phase  III,  the  International  Space  Station  will  progress  gradually  to  its  ultimate  status  as  a  fully
operational permanent orbital research facility. Among key additions to the core conÔ¨Åguration are the
remaining  modules  of  the  U.S.-built  solar  array;  the  Japanese  experiment  module,  to  be  delivered  in
2000; and the U.S. habitation module which contains the galley, toilet, shower, sleep stations, and medical
facilities. With  the  delivery  of  a  second  Russian  crew  transfer  vehicle  in  June  2002,  the  station  will  be
virtually complete.
