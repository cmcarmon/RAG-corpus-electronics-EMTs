As stated earlier, energy can be added to electrons by applying heat. When enough energy is
absorbed by the valence electrons, it is possible for them to break some of their covalent bonds. Once the
bonds are broken, the electrons move to the conduction band where they are capable of supporting
electric current. When a voltage is applied to a crystal containing these conduction band electrons, the
electrons move through the crystal toward the applied voltage. This movement of electrons in a
semiconductor is referred to as electron current flow.
