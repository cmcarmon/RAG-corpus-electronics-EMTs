For a MOSFET, the derivation resulting in Equation 8.11 shows how to
relate the incremental drain to source current ids to the incremental gate
to source voltage vgs.
By definition, an input signal vI has an incremental component vi and
a DC component VI.
In general, if a device variable xB depends on some other variable xA as
