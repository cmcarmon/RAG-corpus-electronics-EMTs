Coeﬃcient values determine how the output behaves. The parameter b can be any value, and
serves as a gain. The eﬀect of the parameter a is more complicated (Table 5.2). If it equals zero,
the output simply equals the input times the gain b. For all non-zero values of a, the output
lasts forever; such systems are said to be IIR (Inﬁnite Impulse Response). The reason for this
terminology is that the unit sample also known as the impulse (especially in analog situations), and
the system’s response to the “impulse” lasts forever. If a is positive and less than one, the output
is a decaying exponential. When a = 1, the output is a unit step. If a is negative and greater
than −1, the output oscillates while decaying exponentially. When a = −1, the output changes
sign forever, alternating between b and −b. More dramatic eﬀects when |a| > 1; whether positive
or negative, the output signal becomes larger and larger, growing exponentially.
