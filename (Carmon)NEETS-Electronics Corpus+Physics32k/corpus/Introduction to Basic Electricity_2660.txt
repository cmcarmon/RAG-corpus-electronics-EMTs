At times, it is necessary to shift the phase of the 
AC output signal with respect to the input signal. RC 
networks can be used for phase shifting applications. 
The rC phase-shift networks are used only where 
small amounts, less than 60Â°, of phase shift are desired.
Figure 24-8 shows an RC phase-shift network with 
the input applied across the resistor-capacitor combi-
nation and the output taken across the resistor. In the 
circuit, the current leads the voltage because of the ca-
pacitor. The voltage across the resistor is in phase with 
the resistor, which results in the output voltage leading 
the input voltage.
