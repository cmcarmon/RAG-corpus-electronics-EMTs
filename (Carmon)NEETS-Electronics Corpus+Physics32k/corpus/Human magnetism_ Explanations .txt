According to scientists, if people can stick objects to their body, not only metal but also other materials, it has actually nothing to do with magnetism. Skeptic Benjamin Radford has used a compass to check the magnetic field of a person that claimed to be a human magnet. He claims that person didn't actually produce magnetic fields. It shows that human magnetism uses different kinds of physical effects. Many scientists and proponents of science, including James Randi, claim that this ability is caused by sticky skin.
