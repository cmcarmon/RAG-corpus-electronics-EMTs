Around 830 AD, Caliph Al-Ma'mun commissioned a group of Muslim astronomers and Muslim geographers to measure the distance from Tadmur (Palmyra) to Raqqa, in modern Syria. They found the cities to be separated by one degree of latitude and the meridian arc distance between them to be 66​2⁄3 miles and thus calculated the Earth's circumference to be 24,000 miles.
Another estimate given by his astronomers was 56​2⁄3 Arabic miles (111.8 km per degree), which corresponds to a circumference of 40,248 km, very close to the currently modern values of 111.3 km per degree and 40,068 km circumference, respectively.
