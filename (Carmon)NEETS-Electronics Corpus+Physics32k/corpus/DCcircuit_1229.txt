This is another practical limitation to superconductors in circuit design, since electric cur-
rent through any conductor produces a magnetic ﬁeld. Even though a superconducting wire
would have zero resistance to oppose current, there will still be a limit of how much current
could practically go through that wire due to its critical magnetic ﬁeld limit.
