From Eq. (52.14) or (52.15) it is clear that the Hall effect is dominated by the most highly conducting band.
Although for fundamental reasons it is often the case that ne = nh (a so-called compensated material), RH would
rarely vanish since the conductivities of the two bands would rarely be identical. It is also clear from any of
Eqs. (52.12), (52.14), or (52.15) that, in general, the Hall effect in semiconductors will be orders of magnitude
larger than that in metals.
