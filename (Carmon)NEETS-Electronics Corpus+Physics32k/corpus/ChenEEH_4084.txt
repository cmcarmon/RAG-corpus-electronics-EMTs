Nonuniform quantization is achieved by Ô¨Årst distorting the
original signal with logarithmic compression characteristics
and then using a uniform quantizer. For small magnitude
signals, the compression characteristics have a much steeper
slope than the slope for large magnitude signals. Thus, a given
signal change at small magnitudes will carry the uniform
quantizer through more steps than the same change at large
magnitudes. The compression characteristic effectively changes
the distribution of the input signal magnitude so there is no
preponderance of low-magnitude signals at the output of the
compressor. After compression, the distorted signal is used as
an input to a uniform quantizer. At the receiver, an inverse
compression characteristic, called expansion, is used so that
the overall transmission is not distorted. The whole process
(compression and expansion) is called companding.
