Electric charges are the sources of a vector ﬁeld called the
electric ﬂux density. The relationship between a source and
its ﬂux is always expressed in the form of a conservation law
as in equation 2.2c. The fundamental analysis problem of
electrostatics is to calculate the vector ﬁelds resulting from
a speciﬁc charge distribution. In the following section, this
is done directly from equation 2.2c by exploiting symmetry.
To solve for the ﬁelds due to more general asymmetric charge
distributions requires a source-ﬁeld relationship, as derived
in Subsection 2.2.2. Finally, a simpliﬁcation of the problem
can be obtained by considering the vector ﬁelds to be
derivable from potential
functions. This is presented in
Section 2.2.3.
