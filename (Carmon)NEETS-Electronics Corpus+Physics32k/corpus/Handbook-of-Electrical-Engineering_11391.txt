In  addition  to  the  specular  reﬂection  that  occurs  at  an  interface  between  two  media  of  different  speciﬁc
acoustic  impedance  as  described  above  (where  any  curvature  along  the  interface  is  negligible  over  distances
comparable to a wavelength), energy may also be scattered in all directions by inhomogeneities in the medium.
An acoustic image is formed by using this scattered energy as well as specular reﬂections. The fraction of the
incident energy reﬂected or scattered is very small for soft tissues.
