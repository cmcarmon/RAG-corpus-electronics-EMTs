Figure  66.31  shows  the  ﬂowchart  for  a  simple  dc
machine  simulation.  The  required  inputs  are Va,  vf,
and  Tmech.  Solving  the  windings’  voltage  equations
with the required inputs, we can obtain the winding
currents, Ia and if. The magnetizing curve block con-
tains open-circuit test data of the machine to translate
φ  or  the  ratio  of  the  open-circuit  armature
if  to  ka
voltage to some ﬁxed speed, that is Ea/ω
mo. The sim-
ulation yields the output of the two winding currents,
the  ﬁeld  ﬂux,  the  developed  torque,  and  the  rotor
speed.
