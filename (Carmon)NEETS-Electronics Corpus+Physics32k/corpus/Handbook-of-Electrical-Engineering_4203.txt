Radar Applications
The breadth of pulse radar applications is summarized in Table 41.1. Radar applications can be grouped into
search, track, and signature measurement applications. Search radars are used for tracking but have relatively
large range and angle errors. The search functions favor broad beam-widths and low bandwidths in order to
efÔ¨Åciently search over a large spatial volume. As indicated in Table 41.1, search is preferably performed in the
lower frequency bands. The antenna pattern is narrow in azimuth and has a cosecant pattern in elevation to
provide acceptable coverage from the horizon to the zenith.
