To this point in our study of electronic circuits, time has not been important.
The analyses and designs we have performed so far have been static, and all
circuit responses at a given time have depended only on the circuit inputs at
that time. An important consequence of this is that our circuits have so far
responded to input changes infinitely fast. This of course does not happen in
reality. Circuits do take time to respond to their inputs, and this delay is often
of significant importance.
