Figure 15.1.3 represents a transmission line of length l connecting a signal source to a distant
load. The line may be a two-wire line, a coaxial cable, or a hollow waveguide. The voltage v1(t)
between the source-side (input) terminals of the transmission line gives rise to an electric ﬁeld,
while the current i1(t) produces a magnetic ﬁeld. The characteristic impedance ¯Z0 of the line is
