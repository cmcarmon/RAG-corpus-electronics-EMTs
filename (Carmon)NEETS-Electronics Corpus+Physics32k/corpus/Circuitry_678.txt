deflection)  is  switched  to  the  1  V/cm  range.  The 
overall  height  of  the  trace  is  4  cm  and  thus  the 
peak-peak  voltage is 4 × 1 V = 4 V. Similarly, the 
time for one complete cycle (period) is 2.5 × 1 ms 
= 2.5  ms.  One  further 
important  piece  of 
information  is  the  shape  of  the  waveform  that,  in 
this case, is sinusoidal. 
 The  front  panel  layout  for  a  typical  general- 
purpose two-channel oscilloscope is shown in Figs 
14.25 and 14.26. The controls and adjustments are 
summarized in Table 14.3.
