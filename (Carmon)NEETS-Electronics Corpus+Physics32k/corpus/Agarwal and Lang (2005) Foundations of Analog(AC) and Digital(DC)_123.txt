The second important parameter of a battery is the total amount of energy
it can store, often measured in joules. However, if you pick up a camcorder or
flashlight battery, you might notice the ratings of ampere-hours or watt-hours.
Let us reconcile these ratings. When a battery is connected across a resistive
load in a circuit, it delivers power. The lightbulb in Figure 1.4a is an example
of a resistive load.
