Rifled barrels have twists in them that spin the football-shaped bullet so that, much like a football, it remains stable in flight. The longer the barrel the better the rotation and with that, the better the accuracy of the weapon. If you examine shot groups from a 2 inch barrel, a 4 inch barrel, and a 6 inch barrel, you’ll find tighter groups with the longer barrels.
When a bullet is fired from a handgun with a 2 inch barrel, the bullet only travels 2 inches before it leaves the barrel. Once it leaves the barrel, the gas pushing it out stops being a factor in the bullet’s propulsion. In fact, in some instances, the powder may not even be fully burned at that point. So the muzzle velocity of a 2 inch barrel is less than that of a 4 inch barrel.
Large naval guns will have length-to-diameter ratios of 38:1 to 50:1. This length ratio maximizes the projectile velocity. There is much interest in modernizing naval weaponry by using electrically driven railguns, which overcome the limitations noted above. With railguns, a constant acceleration is provided along the entire length of the device, greatly increasing the muzzle velocity. There is also a significant advantage in not having to carry explosive propellant, and even the projectile internal charges may be eliminated due to the high velocity – the projectile becomes a strictly kinetic weapon.
