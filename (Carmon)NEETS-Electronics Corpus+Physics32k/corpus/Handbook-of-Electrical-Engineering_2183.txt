Kohonen SOFM networks produce a mapping between the continuous input space to the discrete output
space preserving topological properties of the input space (i.e., local neighbors in the input space are mapped
to neighbors in the output space). During training, both the spatial neighborhoods and the learning constant
are decreased slowly by starting with a large neighborhood s
0, and decreasing it (N0 controls the scheduling).
