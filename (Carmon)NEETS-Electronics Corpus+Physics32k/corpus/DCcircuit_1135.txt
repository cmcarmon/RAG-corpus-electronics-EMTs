Any battery containing water in the electrolyte is subject to the production of hydrogen gas
due to electrolysis. This is especially true for overcharged lead-acid cells, but not exclusive to
that type. Hydrogen is an extremely ﬂammable gas (especially in the presence of free oxygen
created by the same electrolysis process), odorless and colorless. Such batteries pose an explo-
sion threat even under normal operating conditions, and must be treated with respect. The
author has been a ﬁrsthand witness to a lead-acid battery explosion, where a spark created by
the removal of a battery charger (small DC power supply) from an automotive battery ignited
hydrogen gas within the battery case, blowing the top off the battery and splashing sulfuric
acid everywhere. This occurred in a high school automotive shop, no less. If it were not for
all the students nearby wearing safety glasses and buttoned-collar overalls, signiﬁcant injury
could have occurred.
