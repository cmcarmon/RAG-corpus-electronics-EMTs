Both capstans are turned by a single motor which is coupled to the capstan pulleys by a belt. This 
arrangement is very efficient in one direction, but, unfortunately, differential velocity capstans don't work 
in reverse.  If you reversed the tape direction, a negative tension would occur, and the tape would bunch 
up in the area around the magnetic heads.
