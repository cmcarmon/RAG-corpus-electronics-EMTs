Powered flight has evolved only four times (first in insects, then in pterosaurs, birds and bats). It uses muscular power to generate aerodynamic forces and to replace energy lost to drag.
Flapping: moving wings to produce lift and thrust. May ascend without the aid of the wind, as opposed to gliders and parachuters.
