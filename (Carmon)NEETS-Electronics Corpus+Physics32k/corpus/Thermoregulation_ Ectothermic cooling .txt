Evaporation of sweat and other bodily fluids.

Convection:
Increasing blood flow to body surfaces to maximize heat transfer across the advective gradient.

Conduction:
Losing heat by being in contact with a colder surface. For instance:
Lying on cool ground.

Covering in cool mud.

Radiation:
releasing heat by radiating it away from the body.
