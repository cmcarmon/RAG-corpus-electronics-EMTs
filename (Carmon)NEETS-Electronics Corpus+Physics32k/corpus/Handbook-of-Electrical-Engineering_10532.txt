A  great  advantage  of  microprocessor-controlled  systems  is  the  degree  to  which  they  can  be  self-diagnosing.
Each intelligent subsystem has internal self-diagnostics which include routines to perform initial tests on power-
up,  update  checks  for “hot”  startup  and  continuous  checking  to  assure  that  inputs  and  outputs  are  within
expected  ranges.  Internal  self-diagnostics  are  also  capable  of  performing  self-tests  on  request.  When  fault
conditions are noted, typically there are internal resets to allow for inaccurate data, with faults being logged
after a certain number of occurrences or duration of a fault condition.
