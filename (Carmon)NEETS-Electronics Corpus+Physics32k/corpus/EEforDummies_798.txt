of rechargeable batteries today. They come in a variety of sizes 
(AAA, AA, C, D, and 9 volt) and generate about 1.2 volts. One 
drawback to NiMH batteries is that they self‐discharge over a few 
months if not used, but some low self‐discharge NiMH battery 
models are available. I suggest you use NiMH batteries for projects 
that need rechargeable batteries.
