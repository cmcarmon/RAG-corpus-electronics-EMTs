The TORQUE DIFFERENTIAL RECEIVER (TDR) is electrically identical to the TDX. The 
only difference in their construction is that the TDR has some form of damping. The real difference 
between the two differentials lies in their applications. The TDR has two electrical inputs, one to the rotor 
and the other to the stator. The output is the mechanical position of the rotor. As is the case with the TDX, 
the addition or subtraction function of the TDR depends upon how it is connected in the system.
