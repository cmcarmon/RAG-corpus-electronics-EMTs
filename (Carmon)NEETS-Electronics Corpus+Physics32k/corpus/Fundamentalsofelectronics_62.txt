This kind of signal is used to describe signals that “turn on” suddenly. For example, to mathematically repre-
sent turning on an oscillator, we can write it as the product of a sinusoid and a step: s (t) = A sin (2πf t) u(t).
2.2.5 Pulse
The unit pulse (Figure 2.5) describes turning a unit-amplitude signal on for a duration of ∆ seconds, then
turning it oﬀ.
