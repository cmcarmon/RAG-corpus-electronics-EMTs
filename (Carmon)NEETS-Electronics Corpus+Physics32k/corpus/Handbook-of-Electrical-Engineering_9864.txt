We  see  that  the  ﬁrst  requirement,  that  the  gain  is  1  at  the  crossover  frequency,  is  satisﬁed  by  the  foregoing
equation if the crossover frequency occurs on the –1 slope portion of the gain curve as assumed in Fig. 100.20.
We use the arctangent approximation to obtain the phase shift in the vicinity of crossover as
