For dynamic systems described by a ﬁnite number of ordinary
differential equations, the state of the dynamic system can be
represented as a vector x(t) in continuous-time. For dynamic
systems described by a ﬁnite number of ordinary difference
equations, the state of the dynamic system can be represented
as a vector x(k) in discrete-time. In either case, x 2 Rn. The
vector representation of the state allows numerous tools from
linear algebra to be applied to the analysis and design of state
estimation and control systems. The state-space model
in
continuous-time representation is the following:
