The South Iceland Seismic Zone (SISZ) has been the location of numerous large destructive earthquakes in the past. The SISZ is an east-west trending transform zone approximately 70 km long and 10â€“20 km wide. Destructive earthquake sequences in this region usually consist of several earthquakes exceeding a magnitude of 6.5 and with their epicentres located on north-south trending faults. Such a sequence started on 17 June 2000 at 15:40 local time with an earthquake of magnitude 6.5. It was followed on 21 June 2000 at 00:51 by a magnitude 6.4 event. Earthquake-induced damage was widespread, although fortunately there was no loss of life and no serious injuries.
