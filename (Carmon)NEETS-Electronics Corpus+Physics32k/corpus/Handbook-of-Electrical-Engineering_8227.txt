Gray Scale
The ac or dc memory displays cannot use pulse intensity or pulse width modulation for gray scale because the
pixels  in  memory  mode  are  either  on  or  off  and  such  pulse  perturbations  would,  in  many  cases,  have  the
undesirable  effect  of  changing  the  state  of  the  pixel.  Instead  these  memory  displays  achieve  gray  scale  by
modulating the percentage of time that the pixel is on in a given frame. This means that the pixels must be
addressed multiple times per frame. In the sequence shown in Fig. 83.34 for 256 intensity levels, each frame is
divided into eight sub-ﬁelds and each sub-ﬁeld consists of an address period and a sustain period [Yoshikawa,
1992]. During a given address period, address pulses are applied to all pixels in the panel according to the sub-
ﬁeld  image  data.  Each  of  the  eight  sub-ﬁelds  has  a  sustain  period  with  a  different  number  of  sustain  cycles
which emits an amount of light proportional to the number of sustain cycles. If each data bit of a given pixel
