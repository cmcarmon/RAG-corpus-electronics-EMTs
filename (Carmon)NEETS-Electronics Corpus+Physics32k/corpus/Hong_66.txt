A Diode is an electronic equivalent of a one-way valve; it allows current to flow 
in only one direction. There are two terminals on a diode, which are known as the anode 
and  cathode.  Current  is  only  allowed  to  flow  from  anode  to  cathode.  The  symbol  and 
drawing for the diode are shown in Figure 6.1 and Figure 6.2. The dark band of the diode 
drawing indicates the cathode mark on the diode symbol. The direction of current flow is 
indicated by the direction of the triangle. An easy trick for remembering the direction of 
current flow is to remember that of the current flowing alphabetically, from the anode to 
the cathode.
