Preconsolidation pressure σ'pThe effective stress that marks the boundary between stiff and soft deformation response of a soil to loading
Usually indicative of high loadings in the past from glaciers or eroded layers

Recompression Index CR = Δe/Δlogσ'vHow the soil will change volume (settle) under loads less than the preconsolidation pressure
Can be used to approximate swelling due to unloading

Compression Index CC = Δe/Δlogσ'vHow the soil will change volume (settle) under loads greater than the preconsolidation pressure

Duration of Primary Consolidation tp
Secondary Compression Index Cα = Δe/ΔlogtHow the soil will change volume (settle) under a constant loading
