Let us assume that the system has N generators like before,
and the total number of busses including generator and load
busses is M. To simplify the notation, bus number 1 is assumed
to be the slack bus. Busses 2 to N are the PV busses, and busses
numbered N Ã¾ 1 through M are PQ busses. The slack bus
generation PGI becomes a dependent variable, while the
remaining generations PG2 through PGN are the control vari-
ables for the minimization. Real and reactive loads are de-
noted by PDi and QDi, respectively. Suppose the ith or jth
entry Y ij of the Y bus matrix has the magnitude Yij and the
phase gij.
