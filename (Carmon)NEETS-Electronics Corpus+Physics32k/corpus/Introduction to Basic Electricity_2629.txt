When an AC voltage is applied to a capacitor, it gives 
the appearance that electrons are flowing in the circuit. 
However, electrons do not pass through the dielectric 
of the capacitor. As the applied AC voltage increases 
and decreases in amplitude, the capacitor charges and 
discharges. The resulting movement of electrons from 
one plate of the capacitor to the other represents cur-
rent flow.
