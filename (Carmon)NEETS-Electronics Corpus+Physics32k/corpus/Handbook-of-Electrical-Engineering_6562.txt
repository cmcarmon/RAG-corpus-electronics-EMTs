Repeater
The  repeater  is  a  regenerator  that  detects  the  optical  signal  by  converting  it  into  electrical  form.  It  then
determines  the  content  of  the  pulse  stream  and  uses  this  information  to  generate  a  new  optical  signal  and
launch this improved pulse train into the Ô¨Åber. The new optical pulse stream is identical to the one originally
transmitted. The regenerated pulses are restored to their original shape and power level by the repeater.
