For  a  system  employing  frequency  reuse  via  dual  polarizations,  the  polarization  coupling  factor G  between  a
wave  and  antenna  determines  the  interference  power.  The  (C/I)  due  to  polarization  is  the  ratio  of  desired
(copolarized) receive power and undesired (cross polarized) receive powers as measured at the same receive port.
This polarization isolation may be found by application of Eq. (74.12) to co-polarized and cross-polarized cases.
