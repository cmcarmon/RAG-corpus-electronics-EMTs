Amplifiers abound in the devices we use in our day to day life, such as
stereos, loud speakers, and cell phones. Amplifiers can be represented as shown
in Figure 7.1 as three-ported devices with a control input port, an output port,
and a power port. Each port comprises two terminals. An input signal rep-
resented as a time-varying voltage or current is applied across or through the
input terminals. An amplified version of the signal (either a voltage or a current)
appears at the output. Depending on its internal structure, an amplifier can
amplify the input current, the input voltage, or both. When the V Ã— I product
of the output exceeds that of the input, a power gain results. The power supply
provides the necessary power for the resulting power amplification. The power
supply also provides for the internal power consumption within the amplifier
as well. A device must provide power gain to be called an amplifier.1
