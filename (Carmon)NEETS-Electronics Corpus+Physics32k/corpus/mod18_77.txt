Many radar systems are designed to determine only the range and bearing of an object. Such radar
systems are called TWO-DIMENSIONAL (2D) radars. In most cases these systems are further described
as SEARCH RADAR SYSTEMS and function as early-warning devices that search a fixed volume of
space. The range and bearing coordinates provide enough information to place the target in a general area
with respect to the radar site and to determine distance, direction of travel, and relative speed. However,
when action must be taken against an airborne target, altitude must be known as well. A search radar
system that detects altitude as well as range and bearing is called a THREE-DIMENSIONAL (3D) radar.
