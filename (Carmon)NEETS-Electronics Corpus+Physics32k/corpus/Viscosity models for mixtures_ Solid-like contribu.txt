In the 2000s, the development of the solid-like viscosity contribution started with Macías-Salinas et al.(2003) who used the Eyring equation in TS theory as an analogue to the solid-like viscosity contribution, and as a generalization of the first exponential liquid viscosity model proposed by Reynolds(1886). The Eyring equation models irreverible chemical reactions at constant pressure, and the equation therefore uses Gibbs activation energy,



Δ

G

‡




{\displaystyle \Delta G^{\ddagger }}
, to model the transition state energy that the system uses to move matter (i.e. separate molecules) from the initial state to the final state (i.e. the new compound). In the Couette flow, the system moves matter from one sliding surface to another, due to fluctuating internal energy, and probably also due to pressure and the pressure gradient. Besides, the pressure effect on viscosity is somewhat different for systems in a medium pressure range than it is for systems in a very high pressure range. Cruz-Reyes et al.(2005) uses Helmholtz energy (F = U-TS = G-PV) as potential in the exponential function. This gives

Cruz-Reyes et al.(2005) states that the Gibbs activation energy is negative proportional to the internal energy of vaporization (and thus calculated at a point on the freezing curve), but Macías-Salinas et al.(2013) changes that to be the residual internal energy,

A recurrent problem for viscosity models is the calculation of liquid molar volume for a given pressure using an EOS that is not perfect. This calls for introduction of some emprical parameters. Use of adjustable proportionality factors for both the residual internal energy and the Z-factor is a natural choice. The sensitivity of P versus V-b values for liquids makes it natural to introduce an empirical exponent (power) to the dimensionless Z-factor. The empirical power turns out to be very effective in the high pressure (high Z-factor) region. The solid-like viscosity contribution proposed by Macías-Salinas et al.(2013) is then
