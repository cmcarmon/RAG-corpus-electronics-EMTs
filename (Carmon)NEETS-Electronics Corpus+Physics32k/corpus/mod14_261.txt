In figure 2-17, we have placed an inverter on the A input. When A is HIGH, the inverter makes it a
LOW going into the AND gate. In order for the output to be HIGH, A would have to be LOW while B is
HIGH, as shown in the Truth Table. If the inverter were on the B input, the output expression would then
be f = A B .
