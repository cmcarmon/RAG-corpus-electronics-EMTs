7.3.2 A particular BJT has a nominal value of α 0.99.
Calculate the nominal β. If α can easily change
±1%, compute the percentage changes that can
occur in β.
*7.3.3 A silicon BJT has an emitter current of 5 mA at 300
K when the BEJ is forward-biased by vBE = 0.7
V. Find the reverse saturation current of the BEJ.
Neglecting ICBO, calculate iC, β, and iB if α = 0.99.
7.3.4 The parameters of a BJT are given by α = 0.98,
ICBO = 90 nA, and iC = 7.5 mA. Find β, iB, and
iE.
7.3.5 For a BJT with vBE = 0.7 V, ICBO = 4 nA,
iE = 1 mA, and iC = 0.9 mA, evaluate α, iB, iSE,
and β.
7.3.6 Consider the circuit of Figure P7.3.6 in which the
silicon BJT has β = 85 and other typical values
at room temperature. ICBO may be neglected.
(a) Compute iB, iC, and iE, and check whether the
transistor is in the active mode of operation.
(b) Check what happens if β is reduced by 10%.
(c) Check what happens if β is increased by 20%.
