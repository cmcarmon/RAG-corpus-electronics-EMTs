Contract  provisions  can  be  reviewed  to  ensure  that  suppliers  are  being  directed  to  use  environmentally
preferable technologies and materials where possible. For example, are virgin materials being required where
they are unnecessary? Do contracts, standards, and speciﬁcations clearly call for the use of recycled materials
where they meet relevant performance requirements? Likewise, customer and internal standards and speciﬁ-
cations can be reviewed with the same goal in mind.
