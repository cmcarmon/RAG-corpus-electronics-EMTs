Thévenin’s Theorem 
 
Thévenin’s  Theorem  allows  us 
to  replace  a 
complicated  network  of  resistances  and  voltage 
sources with a simple equivalent circuit comprising 
a single voltage  source  connected in series with a 
single resistance (see Fig. 3.15). 
  The  single  voltage  source  in  the  Thévenin 
equivalent  circuit,  Voc, is  simply  the  voltage  that 
appears  between  the  terminals  when  nothing  is 
connected to it. In other words, it is the open-circuit 
voltage that would appear between A and B. 
  The  single  resistance 
the 
Thévenin equivalent circuit, R, is the resistance that 
would be seen looking into the network between A
