In books on elementary kinetic theory one can find results for dilute gas modeling that has widespread use. Derivation of the kinetic model for shear viscosity usually starts by considering a Couette flow where two parallel plates are separated by a gas layer. The upper plate is moving at a constant velocity to the right due to a force F. The lower plate is stationary, and an equal and opposite force must therefore be acting on it to keep it at rest. The molecules in the gas layer have a forward velocity component



u


{\displaystyle u}
which increase uniformly with distance



y


{\displaystyle y}
above the lower plate. The non-equilibrium flow is superimposed on a Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium distribution of molecular motions.
Let



σ


{\displaystyle \sigma }
be the collision cross section of one molecule colliding with another. The number density



C


{\displaystyle C}
is defined as the number of molecules per (extensive) volume



C

V


{\displaystyle C=N/V}
. The collision cross section per volume or collision cross section density is

{\displaystyle C\sigma }
, and it is related to the mean free path



l


{\displaystyle l}
by





l

{\displaystyle \quad l={\frac {1}{{\sqrt {2}}C\sigma }}}

Notice that the unit of the collision cross section per volume



C
σ


{\displaystyle C\sigma }
is reciprocal of length. The mean free path is the average distance traveled by a molecule, or a number of molecules per volume, before they make their first collision.
Let




u

0




{\displaystyle u_{0}}
be the forward velocity of the gas at an imaginary horizontal surface inside the gas layer. On the average, a molecule that crosses the surface makes its last collision before crossing at a distance equal to two-thirds of the mean free path (i.e.

{\displaystyle 2l/3}

{\displaystyle \quad p_{x}^{\pm }=m\left(u_{0}\pm {\frac {2}{3}}l{du \over dy}\right)}

where m is the molecular mass. The molecular flux



Φ


{\displaystyle \Phi }
includes all molecules arriving at one side of an element of the surface within the gas layer. The incoming molecules are coming from all directions at the one side of the surface and with all speeds. This molecular flux (i.e. the number flux) is related to the average molecular speed

Notice that the forward velocity gradient

and



M


{\displaystyle M}
is the molar mass. The equation above presupposes that the gas density is low (i.e. the pressure is low). This implies that the kinetic translational energy dominates over rotational and vibrational molecule energies. The viscosity equation further presupposes that there is only one type of gas molecules, and that the gas molecules are perfect elastic and hard core particles of spherical shape. This assumption of elastic, hard core spherical molecules, like billiard balls, implies that the collision cross section of one molecule can be estimated by

The radius



r


{\displaystyle r}
is called collision cross section radius or kinetic radius, and the diameter



d


{\displaystyle d}
is called collision cross section diameter or kinetic diameter of a molecule in a monomolecular gas. There are no simple general relation between the collision cross section and the hard core size of the (fairly spherical) molecule. The relation depends on shape of the potential energy of the molecule. For a real spherical molecule (i.e. a noble gas atom or a reasonably spherical molecule) the interaction potential is more like the Lennard-Jones potential or Morse potential which have a negative part that attracts the other molecule from distances longer than the hard core radius. The radius for zero Lennard-Jones potential is then appropriate to use as estimate for the kinetic radius.
