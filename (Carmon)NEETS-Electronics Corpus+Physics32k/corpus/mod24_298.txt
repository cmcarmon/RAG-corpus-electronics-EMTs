Manufacturers design fiber optic cables for specific applications. Is the cable buried underground or
hung from telephone poles? Is the cable snaked through cableways, submerged in water, or just laid on
the ground? Is the cable used in industrial, telecommunication, utility, or military applications? Each
different application may require a slightly different cable design.
