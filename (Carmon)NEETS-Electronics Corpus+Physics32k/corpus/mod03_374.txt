A thermal trip element circuit breaker uses a bimetallic element that is heated by the load current.
The bimetallic element is made from strips of two different metals bonded together. The metals expand at
different rates as they are heated. This causes the bimetallic element to bend as it is heated by the current
going to the load. Figure 2-19 shows how this can be used to trip the circuit breaker.
