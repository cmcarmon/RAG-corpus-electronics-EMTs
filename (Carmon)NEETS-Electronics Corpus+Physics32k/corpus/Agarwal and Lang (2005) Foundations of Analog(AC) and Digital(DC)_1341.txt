(cid:1) The corresponding experiment on an inductor yields less exciting results,
however. Establish an inductor current by the circuit in Figure 9.54, with
the switch in position 1. Then move the switch to position 2 (make before
break). The current will decay to zero in fractions of a second, because
the energy stored in the magnetic field is rapidly dissipated in the internal
resistance of the coil.
