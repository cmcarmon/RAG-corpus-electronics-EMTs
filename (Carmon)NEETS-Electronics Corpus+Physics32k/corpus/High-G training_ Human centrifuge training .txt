Human centrifuges are exceptionally large centrifuges that test the reactions and tolerance of pilots and astronauts to acceleration above those experienced in the Earth's gravity.
KBRwyle at Brooks City-Base in San Antonio, Texas, operates a human centrifuge. The centrifuge at Brooks is used to train USAF and USN aircrew for sustained high-G flight.
The use of large centrifuges to simulate a feeling of gravity has been proposed for future long-duration space missions. Exposure to this simulated gravity would prevent or reduce the bone decalcification and muscle atrophy that affect individuals exposed to long periods of freefall. An example of this can be seen aboard the Discovery spacecraft in the film 2001: A Space Odyssey.
Man-rated centrifuges are made by AMST Systemtechnik in Austria (Austria Metall SystemTechnik), Latécoère in France, Wyle Laboratories and ETC in the US.
