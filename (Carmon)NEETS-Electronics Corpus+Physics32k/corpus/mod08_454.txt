The block diagram symbol for a magnetic amplifier is shown in figure 3-41. The triangle is the
general symbol for an amplifier. The saturable-core reactor symbol in the center of the triangle identifies
the amplifier as a magnetic amplifier. Notice the input and output signals shown. The input signal is a
small-amplitude, low-power a.c. signal. The output signal is a pulsating d.c. with an amplitude that varies.
This variation is controlled by the input signal and represents a power gain of 1000.
