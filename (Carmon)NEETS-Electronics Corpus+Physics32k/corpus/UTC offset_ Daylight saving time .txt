Several regions in North America, Europe and Australia use daylight saving time (DST). The UTC offset during observation of DST is typically obtained by adding one hour to standard time. Central European Time UTC+01:00 is replaced by Central European Summer Time UTC+02:00, and Pacific Standard Time UTC−08:00 is replaced by Pacific Daylight Time UTC−07:00.
