Let us illustrate these ideas with an example. The circuit shown in
Figure 10.29a contains a switch, which is moved from position (1) to posi-
tion (2) at t = 0. If the switch has been in position (1) for a long time, the
capacitor will be charged to the voltage V1. That is, the initial condition for the
circuit is
