Transforming light into electricity
Solar cells, also known as photovoltaic cells, produce a small voltage when you 
shine light on them. They are made from semiconductors, which are materi-
als that are somewhere between conductors and insulators in terms of their 
willingness to give up their electrons. (I discuss semiconductors in detail in 
Chapter 9.) The amount of voltage produced by a solar cell is fairly constant, 
no matter how much light you shine on it — but the strength of the current 
you can draw depends on the intensity of the light: The brighter the light, the 
higher the strength of the available current (that is, until you reach the solar 
cell’s maximum output, at which point 
no more current can be drawn).
