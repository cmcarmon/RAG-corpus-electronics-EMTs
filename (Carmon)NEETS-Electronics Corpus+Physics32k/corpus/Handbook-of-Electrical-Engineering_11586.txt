Technology  transfer  in  the  rehabilitation  arena  is  difÔ¨Åcult,  due  to  the  limited  and  fragmented  market.
Advances  in  rehabilitation  engineering  are  often  piggybacked  onto  advances  in  commercial  electronics.  For
example, the exciting developments in text-to-speech and  speech-to-text devices mentioned above are being
driven  by  the  commercial  marketplace,  and  not  by  the  rehabilitation  arena.  But  such  developments  will  be
welcomed by rehabilitation engineers no less.
