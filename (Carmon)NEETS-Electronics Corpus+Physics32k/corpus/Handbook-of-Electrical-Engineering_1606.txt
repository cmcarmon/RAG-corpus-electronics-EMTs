There  are  several  parameter  estimation  schemes.  If  the  process  X(t)  is  parametrically  known,  i.e.,  if  its
conditional joint probability density functions are known for each ﬁxed value qm of the vector parameter qm,
then the corresponding parameter estimation scheme is called parametric. If the statistics of the process X(t)
are nonparametrically described, i.e., given qm ˛ %m any joint probability density function of the process is a
member  of  some  nonparametric  class  of  probability  density  functions,  then  the  nonparametric estimation
schemes arise.
