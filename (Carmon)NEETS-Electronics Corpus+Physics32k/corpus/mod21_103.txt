The inherent resistance of the conductor with which an inductor is wound is the most important
factor contributing to the losses of the inductor. Losses caused by this resistance increase with frequency.
This results in a concentration of current near the outer surface of the wire, called SKIN EFFECT. Skin
effect is negligible at low frequencies, but can be an important factor at high frequencies. Other
contributing factors to inductor losses are (1) eddy currents set up in the core and surrounding objects (if
they are conductors); (2) the dielectric properties of the form used for the coil and surrounding objects;
and (3) hysteresis in the core and surrounding objects, if they are magnetic metals. Losses occur as a
result of the dielectric properties of the coil form because of the distributed capacitance of the inductor
(for example, between turns and between the terminals and leads). To some extent the core and
surrounding objects serve as a dielectric of the distributed capacitance, and the resulting dielectric losses
contribute to the overall losses of the inductor.
