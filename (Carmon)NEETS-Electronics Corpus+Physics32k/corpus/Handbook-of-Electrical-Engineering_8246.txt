Figure 84.4 shows an instrumentation ampliﬁer with programmable gain where the programs are stored in
the  channel-gain  list.  The  reason  for  having  such  sophistication  is  to  match  transducer  outputs  with  the
maximum  allowable  input  range  of  the ADC.  This  is  very  important  in  improving  accuracy  in  cases  where
transducer output voltage ranges are much smaller than the full-scale input range of an ADC, as is usually the
case.  Indeed,  this  is  equally  true  for  signals  that  are  larger  than  the  full-scale  range,  and  in  such  cases  the
ampliﬁer  functions  as  an  attenuator.  Furthermore,  the  instrumentation  ampliﬁer  converts  a  bipolar  voltage
signal into a unipolar voltage with respect to the system ground. This action will reduce a major control task
as far as the ADC is concerned; that is, the ADC is always sent unipolar voltages, and hence it is possible to
maintain unchanged the mode control input which toggles the ADC between the unipolar and bipolar modes
of an ADC.
