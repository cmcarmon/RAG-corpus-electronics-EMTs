Front shocks, key components in suspension bicycles, are designed to reduce the impact of bumps and jolts for a smoother ride. The bearing sits between the inner shaft and outer housing to facilitate smooth movement in the mechanism for optimum performance. Composite bearings with a PTFE liner act as a cushion, absorbing excess vibrations to further enhance the movement.
