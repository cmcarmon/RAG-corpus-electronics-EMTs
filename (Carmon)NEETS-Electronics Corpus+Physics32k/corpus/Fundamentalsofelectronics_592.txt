By choosing the value of K, we can compute the spectrum at as many equally spaced frequencies as
we like. Note that you can think about this computationally motivated choice as sampling the spectrum;
more about this interpretation later. The issue now is how many frequencies are enough to capture how
the spectrum changes with frequency. One way of answering this question is determining an inverse discrete
Fourier transform formula: given S (k), k = {0, . . . , K − 1} how do we ﬁnd s (n), n = {0, . . . , N − 1}?
