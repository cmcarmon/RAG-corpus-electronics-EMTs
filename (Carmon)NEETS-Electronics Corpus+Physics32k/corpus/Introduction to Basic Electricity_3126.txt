The output voltage can be increased or decreased 
by changing the zener diode and the series resistor. 
The circuit just described supplies a constant volt-
age. When a circuit is designed, the current in the 
circuit must be considered as well as the voltage. The 
external load requires a specific load	current	(iL) 
 determined by the load resistance and output voltage 
(FigureÂ  30-4). The load current and the zener current
