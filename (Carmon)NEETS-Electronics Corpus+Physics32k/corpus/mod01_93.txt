About 1600, William Gilbert, an English scientist, made a study of other substances which had been
found to possess qualities of attraction similar to amber. Among these were glass, when rubbed with silk,
and ebonite, when rubbed with fur. Gilbert classified all the substances which possessed properties similar
to those of amber as electrics, a word of Greek origin meaning amber.
