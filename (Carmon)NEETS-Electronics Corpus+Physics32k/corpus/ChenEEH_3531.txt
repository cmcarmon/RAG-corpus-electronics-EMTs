As pointed out before, a discrete-time signal can be ex-
pressed as a weighted sum of shifted discrete-time unit im-
pulses. Similarly, a continuous-time signal can be expressed as
the integral of weighted and shifted continuous-time unit
impulses. This representation, together with system properties
of linearity and shift invariance, allows us to create a practical
and useful characterization of a system in terms of a function
called the impulse response of the system.
