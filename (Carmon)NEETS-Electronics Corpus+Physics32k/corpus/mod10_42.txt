Early man was quick to recognize the need to communicate beyond the range of the human voice. To
satisfy this need, he developed alternate methods of communication, such as hand gestures, beating on a
hollow log, and smoke signals. Although these methods were effective, they were still greatly limited in
range. Eventually, the range limitations were overcome by the development of courier and postal systems;
but there was then a problem of speed. For centuries the time required for the delivery of a message
depended on the speed of a horse.
