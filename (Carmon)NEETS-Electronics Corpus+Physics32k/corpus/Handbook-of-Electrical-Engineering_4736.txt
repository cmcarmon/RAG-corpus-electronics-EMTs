Thus, while the input impedance is inﬁnite as in a parallel resonant circuit at v
o, it is zero as in a series resonant
circuit at a slightly lower frequency where the bracketed term in Eq. (48.14) is zero. When losses are present
or there is radiation out of an acoustic port, a resistive term is included in the reactive expression of Eq. (48.14).
Behavior  analogous  to  that  of  coupled  tuned  electrical  circuits  for  multipole  ﬁlters  can  be  achieved  by
subdividing the electrodes of Fig. 48.4(a) into different areas, each of which will act separately as a tuned circuit,
but  if  they  are  close  enough  together  there  will  be  acoustic  coupling  between  the  different  radiators.  By
controlling this coupling, narrowband ﬁlters of very high Q and of somewhat tailored frequency response can
be built in the megahertz and low gigahertz range.
