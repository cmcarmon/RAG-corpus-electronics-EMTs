High Level Languages
The  invention  of  FORTRAN  was  a  major  breakthrough  in  engineering  computing.  A  high-level  language,
FORTRAN  and  the 
  that  convert  it  into  machine  code,  allowed  engineers  to  write  programs  in  a
language  that  was  sufﬁciently  close  to  mathematical  notation  so  as  to  be  quite  natural.  Since  its  invention,
numerous other high-level languages have been created, although FORTRAN continues to dominate engineer-
ing “number-crunching”. For the implementation of control algorithms, assembly languages are still popular
although high(er) level languages such as C, which is the predominant systems programming language, MOD-
ULA, and ADA are gaining acceptance in the market place.
