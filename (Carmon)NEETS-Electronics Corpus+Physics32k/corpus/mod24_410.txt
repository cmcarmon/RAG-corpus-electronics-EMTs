Another type of butt-jointed connector is the biconical connector. Biconical connectors use two
conical plugs, a double conical alignment sleeve, and axial springs to perform fiber alignment. Figure
4-18 is an illustration of this basic biconical connector design. Formation of the plugs and alignment
sleeve involves transfer molding. Transfer molding uses silica-filled epoxy resin to mold the conical plug
directly to the fiber or around a cast (precision wire). After connecting the conical plugs to the optical
fibers, the fiber-end faces are polished before the plugs are inserted into the molded alignment sleeve.
During fiber insertion, the inside surface of the double conical sleeve performs fiber alignment, while the
axial springs push the fiber ends into close contact. If the alignment sleeve permits the fibers to actually
become in contact, then the axial spring provides enough force to maintain fiber contact but prevent
damage to the fiber-end faces. Normally, biconical connectors lock the fibers in alignment using a
threaded outer shell.
