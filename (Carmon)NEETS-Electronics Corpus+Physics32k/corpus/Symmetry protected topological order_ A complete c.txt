Using the notions of quantum entanglement and SPT order, one can obtain a complete classification of all 1D gapped quantum phases.
First, it is shown that there is no (intrinsic) topological order in 1D (ie all 1D gapped states are short-range entangled). Thus, if the Hamiltonians have no symmetry, all their 1D gapped quantum states belong to one phase—the phase of trivial product states. On the other hand, if the Hamiltonians do have a symmetry, their 1D gapped quantum states are either symmetry-breaking phases, SPT phases, and their mix.
Such an understanding allows one to classify all 1D gapped quantum phases: All 1D gapped phases are classified by the following three mathematical objects:

)


{\displaystyle (G_{H},G_{\Psi },H^{2}[G_{\Psi },U(1)])}
, where




G

H




{\displaystyle G_{H}}
is the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian,




G

Ψ




{\displaystyle G_{\Psi }}
the symmetry group of the ground states, and




H

2


[

G

Ψ


,
U
(

)
]


{\displaystyle H^{2}[G_{\Psi },U(1)]}
the second group cohomology class of




G

Ψ




{\displaystyle G_{\Psi }}
. (Note that




H

2


[
G
,
U
(
1
)
]


{\displaystyle H^{2}[G,U(1)]}
classifies the projective representations of



G


{\displaystyle G}
.) If there is no symmetry breaking (ie




G

Ψ


=

G

H




{\displaystyle G_{\Psi }=G_{H}}
), the 1D gapped phases are classified by the projective representations of symmetry group

{\displaystyle G_{H}}
