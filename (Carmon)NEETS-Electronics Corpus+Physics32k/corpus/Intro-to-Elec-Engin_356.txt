based on the two wattmeter readings of the two-wattmeter method.
With the generator action of the source assumed, +P for the real power indicates that the
source is supplying real power to the load; +Q for the reactive power shows that the source is
delivering inductive VARs while the current lags the voltage (i.e., the power factor is lagging); and
−Q for the reactive power indicates that the source is delivering capacitive VARs or absorbing
inductive VARs, while the current leads the voltage (i.e., the power factor is leading).
