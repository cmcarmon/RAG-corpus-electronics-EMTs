. Increment the address of the current microinstruction
to obtain the address of the next micro-instruction. This
is indicated in the microprogram by putting it in the
sequencing ﬁeld. Because sequential execution is encoun-
tered often, many microprogramming systems make this
the default and simply leave the entry blank as the default.
. Branch to the microinstruction that begins execution of
the next instruction. This initial micro-instruction is usu-
ally labeled as Fetch and placed in the sequencing ﬁeld to
indicate this action.
