The per-unit-length elements R, L, G, and C depend on the
resistivity of the conductors, cross-sectional dimensions and
shape of the transmission line, and the permittivity of the
dielectric medium. Expressions of these elements for some
practical transmission lines can be found in any standard elec-
tromagnetics text, such as in Ulaby (1999), listed in Appendix A.
In summary, the propagation constant g and the characteristic
impedance Z0 for the TEM mode depend only on the transmis-
sion lineâ€™s geometrical and physical parameters.
