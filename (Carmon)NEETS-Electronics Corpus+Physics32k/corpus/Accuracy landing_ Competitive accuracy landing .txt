Competitive accuracy landing is a team event with 5 persons on each team that takes place over 8 rounds. The team jumps together, generally from an altitude of 900 meters (3,000 feet), although sometimes as high as 1,100 meters (3,600 feet). The score is measured in meters from "dead center". The best score for each round is 0,00 meters (meaning you hit dead center) and the worst score for a round is 0.16 meter (16 centimeters or 6 inches). Scores for each round are added together, and the scores count both as individual scores and as part of the team score. In some competitions only the four best scores count in the team competition.
