The  Cheetah  disc  drive  is  produced  by  Seagate  Technology,  Scotts Valley,  California,  and  has  been  dubbed  the
industry’s  fastest  disc  drive.  The  Cheetah  is  the  world’s  ﬁrst-announced  drive  to  utilize  10,000-rpm  technology.
The increased rotational remarkably increases data transfer rates to 15 Mbytes/sec which is 40% greater than that
of 7,200-rpm drives. The 10,000-rpm rotational rate also signiﬁcantly reduces the seek time.
