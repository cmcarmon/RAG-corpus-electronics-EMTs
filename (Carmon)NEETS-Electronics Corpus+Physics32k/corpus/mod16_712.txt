16 PHASE LOCK When this control is activated (button lit), it will reduce residual FM when narrow
spans are selected. In narrow spans, the phase lock can be turned off or back on by
pressing the button. Switching the PHASE LOCK off may cause the signal to shift
position. In narrow spans, the signal could shift off the display; however, it will
usually return to its phase locked position after a few moments. The
microcomputer automatically selects PHASE LOCK for a span/division of 50 kHz
or below in bands 1 through 3, 100 kHz or below for band 3, and 200 kHz for
bands 5 and above.
