20°C/W  to  a  complex  aluminium  alloy  extrusion 
with a thermal resistance of 1.2°C/W. Lower values 
of thermal resistance can be obtained with the use 
of forced air cooling. 
  Natural  convection  airflow  can  be  enhanced  by 
the  proper  placement  of  heatsinks  and  other  heat 
producing  components.  Since  warm  air  rises, 
vertical  surfaces  tend  to  transmit  heat  to  the  air 
better  than  comparable  horizontal  surfaces.  The 
hottest devices should be located on the upper side 
of  a  horizontally  mounted  PCB  or  close  to  the 
upper edge of a vertically mounted PCB.
