14.1.16 Determine the bandwidth W from two criteria, (i)
An < (An)max/10, for nf1 > W , and (ii) An <
(An)max/20, for nf1 > W , for the following
cases. (Note that A stands for amplitude.)

(b) Waveform of Figure E14.1.4(b), with A =
(c) Waveform of Figure E14.1.4(d), with A = π
(d) Waveform of Figure E14.1.4(e), with A = π
