b) Now suppose that vS = VS cos(ωt) +  cos(3ωt), where  represents a small
amount of third-harmonic distortion introduced by nonlinearities somewhere in the
transmitter. Since the FCC forbids the broadcast of harmonics, it is important to
check that coupling networks do not inadvertently favor the coupling of harmonics
to the transmitter. For your design in (a), calculate how much third harmonic reaches
the antenna.
