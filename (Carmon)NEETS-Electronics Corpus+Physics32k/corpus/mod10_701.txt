More than four elements are seldom used because accumulated losses cause the elements farther 
from the point of feeding to have less current than the nearer ones. This introduces an unbalanced 
condition in the system and impairs its efficiency. Space limitations often are another reason for 
restricting the number of elements. Since this type of array is in a single line, rather than in a vertically 
stacked arrangement, the use of too many elements results in an antenna several wavelengths long.
