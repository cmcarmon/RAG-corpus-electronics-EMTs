Figure 14-12 shows a few of the ways input and output connections to other 
circuits are shown in schematics. Symbols for input/output connections can 
vary greatly among schematics. The symbols used in this book are among 
the most common. Although the exact style of the symbol may vary from one 
schematic to the next, the idea is the same: The symbol is telling you to make 
a connection to something external to the circuit.
