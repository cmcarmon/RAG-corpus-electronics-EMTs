13.3.11 An induction motor takes 350 kW at 0.8 power
factor lagging while driving a load. When an
overexcited synchronous motor taking 150 kW
is connected in parallel with the induction mo-
tor, the overall power factor is improved to 0.95
lagging. Determine the kVA rating of the syn-
chronous motor.
