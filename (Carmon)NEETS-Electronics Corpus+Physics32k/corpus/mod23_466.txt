The ESDI is an optimized version of the ST-506/412 interface. The main difference is that with 
ESDI, most of the disk drive's interface electronics is located in the disk drive itself, rather than on a 
controller card in the host computer. The result is a much faster transfer rate and more hard disk capacity. 
ESDIs have a transfer rate of up to 24 MB per second. And, they can handle disk drives with a maximum 
capacity of 1.2 GB (gigabytes).
