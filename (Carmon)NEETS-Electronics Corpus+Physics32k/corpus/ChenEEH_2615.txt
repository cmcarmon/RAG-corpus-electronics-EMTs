ation. A circularly polarized wave rotating in the same direc-
tion as the precessing magnetic dipoles is known to have a
strong interaction with the material, while its opposite coun-
terpart has a weaker interaction. Thus, the attenuation (ab-
sorption) of the strong interacting wave is very large near the
gyromagnetic resonance of the ferrite, while it is very small for
the wave propagation in the other direction. This resonance
effect is used to construct the resonance isolators, which usu-
ally consist of a ferrite slab or strip mounted at a certain
position along a transmission line.
