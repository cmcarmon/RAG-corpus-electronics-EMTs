Weiss gave an address about the magneton at a conference in Karlsruhe in September 1911. Several theorists commented that the magneton should involve Planck's constant h. By postulating that the ratio of electron kinetic energy to orbital frequency should be equal to h, Richard Gans computed a value that was almost an order of magnitude larger than the value obtained by Weiss. At the First Solvay Conference in November that year, Paul Langevin obtained a submultiple which gave better agreement. But once the old quantum theory was a bit better understood, no theoretical argument could be found to justify Weiss's value. In 1920, Wolfgang Pauli wrote an article where he called the magneton of the experimentalists the Weiss magneton, and the theoretical value the Bohr magneton.
