where  the  positive  coefﬁcients A  and  B  are  called  the  magnitudes  of  the  signals,  and f  and q  are  the  phase
angles  of  the  signals.  These  mathematical  models  describe  the  physical  behavior  of  electrical  quantities,  and
instrumentation, such as an oscilloscope, can display the actual waveforms represented by the mathematical
model. Although  methods  exist  for  manipulating  the  models  of  circuits  to  obtain  the  magnitude  and  phase
coefﬁcients that uniquely determine the waveform of each voltage and current, the manipulations are cumber-
some and not easily extended to address other issues in circuit analysis.
