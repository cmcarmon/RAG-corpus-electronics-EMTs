View C of the figure shows the same signal. Under these conditions, conduction through Rk will
decrease. This will cause a decrease in current flow through Rk. Decreased current means decreased
voltage drop. The top of Rk will try to go to +5 volts. Ck must now go more negative to follow the top of
Rk. To do this, current must flow from Ck  through Rk,  to the top plate of Ck. This discharging of Ck will
increase current flow through Rk and increase the voltage drop across Rk, forcing the top to go more
positive. Remember, the voltage drop is due to current flow through the resistor. (The resistor could care
less if the current is caused by conduction or capacitor action.) Thus, the cathode stays at +10 volts
throughout the capacitor-charge cycle.
