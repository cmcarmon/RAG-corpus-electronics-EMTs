Instruments are available for measuring impedance between electrode pairs. The procedure is recommended
strongly as good practice, since high impedance leads to distortions that may be difÔ¨Åcult to separate from actual
EEG signals. In fact, electrode impedance monitors are built into some commercial devices for recording EEGs.
Standard dc ohmmeters should not be used, since they apply a polarizing current that causes build-up of noisy
electrode  potential  at  the  skin-electrode  interface.  Commercial  devices  apply  a  known-amplitude  sinusoidal
voltage (typically 1 kHz) to an electrode pair circuit and measure root mean square (rms) current, which is
directly related to the magnitude of the impedance.
