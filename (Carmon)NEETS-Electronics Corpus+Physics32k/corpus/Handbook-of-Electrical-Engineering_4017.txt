Both the signal from the audio oscillator and the ampliﬁed output of the diode are fed to the mixer at
saturating amplitudes, so the low-pass ﬁltered output of the mixer depends only on the difference between
the phases of these two signals. This phase difference is a measure of the deviation from resonance. Thus,
the output of the mixer constitutes an error signal that indicates the adjustment needed to restore the cavity
to resonance. This signal is fed to the motor that drives the plunger to obtain the required tuning adjustment.
