In short distance telemetry the same problems are encountered but from a different cause. If the transmitter
is occluded at one position by the shaft of a rotating machine, it would be expected that reﬂections from nearby
objects  or  walls  would  ﬁll  the  gap.  In  practice  it  is  the  usual  occurrence  that  a  gap  is  generated  once  per
revolution.  This  is  caused  by  multiple  signal  cancellation.  There  are  two  methods  of  overcoming  this  signal
drop-out:  (1)  with  diverse  polarization  and  (2)  by  locating  the  receiving  antenna  close  to  the  transmitting
antenna and effectively surrounding the shaft with it.
