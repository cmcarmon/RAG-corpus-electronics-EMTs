12.2.13 A six-pole, double-layer dc armature winding in
28 slots has ﬁve turns per coil. If the ﬁeld ﬂux
is 0.025 Wb per pole and the speed of the rotor
is 1200 r/min, ﬁnd the value of the induced emf
when the winding is (a) lap connected, and (b)
wave-connected. (Note: The number of parallel
paths is equal to the number of poles for lap wind-
ings, while it is equal to 2 for wave windings.)
