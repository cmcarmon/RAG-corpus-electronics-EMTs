Train #1254 had left Harmon Cove station at 8:33 am with 275 passengers and accelerated to 53 mph, meanwhile Train #1107 departed Hoboken at 8:31 am with 125 passengers aboard. Train #1254 soon passed a Medium Approach Signal telling the train to slow down, according to black box data the train passed this signal at 34 mph, the next signal would show the engineer a stop indication at Bergen Junction to wait for Train #1107 to pass before Train #1254 would be allowed to continue to Hoboken. Train #1254 continued to slow until about 71 feet before the stop indication signal, the engineer then accelerated the train to 20 mph past the red signal light. Shortly afterward the train went into emergency braking after the engineer realized his mistake. Several moments earlier, Train #1107 had been shown a clear signal and was approaching Bergen Junction at 53 mph, the track speed for that section was 70 mph. Train #1254 was moving at 18 mph when the collision occurred, passenger accounts on Train #1254 describe the sound of the brakes and the blaring of the train horn moments before the collision. Cab Car #5146 was ripped open in the collision, killing the engineer John J. DeCurtis, and Arthur David Stern, a passenger aboard train #1254. Locomotive #4148's roof collapsed in on the cab on impact thereby killing Engineer Alfonso Debonis instantly.
