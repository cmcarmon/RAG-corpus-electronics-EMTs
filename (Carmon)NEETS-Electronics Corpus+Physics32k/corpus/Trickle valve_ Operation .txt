Trickle valves can be used only on systems operating under negative pressure. The vacuum created inside the dust collector holds the valve closed, allowing a head of material to build up above the trickle valve. Once the pressure of the material equals the negative pressure of the system, the valve is forced open and a trickle of material will begin flowing from the valve at the same rate it is collected. The magnitude of the vacuum of the system and the bulk density of the material being handled determine how much material will build up before the valve begins to discharge. Because trickle valves work automatically and require no power source or controls, they have very low initial cost and virtually no operating cost.
