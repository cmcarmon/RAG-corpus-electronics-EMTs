period in this condition, the particles will form a detuning wall within the cavity and eventually prevent
the tube from functioning. A second cause of failure is the absorption of gas within the enclosure by the
metal electrodes. This results in a gradual reduction of pressure within the tube to a point where gap
breakdown becomes very difficult. The final result is that extremely strong signals (from the transmitter)
are coupled to the receiver. Because both types of failures develop gradually, the tr tube periodically must
be checked carefully to determine performance level.
