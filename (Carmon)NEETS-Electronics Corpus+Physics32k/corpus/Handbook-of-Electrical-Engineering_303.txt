The networks displayed in Figs. 3.12(b) and (c) are simple ladder networks in the phasor domain, and the
strategy  is  to  Ô¨Årst  determine  the  equivalent  impedances  presented  to  the  voltage  and  current  sources.  In
Fig. 3.12(b), the group of three impedances to the right of the voltage source are in series-parallel and possess
an impedance of
