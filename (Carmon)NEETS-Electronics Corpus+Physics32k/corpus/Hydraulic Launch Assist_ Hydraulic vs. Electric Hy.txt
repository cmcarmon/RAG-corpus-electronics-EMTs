Hydraulic hybrids are said to be power dense, while electric hybrids are energy dense. This implies that electric hybrids, while able to deliver large amounts of energy over long periods of time are limited by the rate at which the chemical energy in the batteries is converted to mechanical energy and vice versa. This is largely governed by reaction rates in the battery and current ratings of associated components. Hydraulic hybrids on the other hand are capable of transferring energy at a much higher rate, but are then limited by the amount of energy that is stored. For this reason, hydraulic hybrids lend themselves well to stop-and-go applications or applications with high vehicle weights.
