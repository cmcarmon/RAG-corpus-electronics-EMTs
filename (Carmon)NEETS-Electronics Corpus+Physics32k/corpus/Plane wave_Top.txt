In the physics of wave propagation, a plane wave (also spelled planewave) is a wave whose wavefronts (surfaces of constant phase) are infinite parallel planes. Mathematically a plane wave takes the form

(




x

t

)

=
f

(





n

c


⋅



x
→



−
t

)




{\displaystyle A\left({\vec {x}},t\right)=f\left({\frac {\vec {n}}{c}}\cdot {\vec {x}}-t\right)\,}

in which the arbitrary (scalar or vector) function



f


{\displaystyle f}
gives the variation of the wave's amplitude, and the fixed unit vector

{\displaystyle |{\vec {n}}|=1}
is the wave's direction of propagation. The solutions in

{\displaystyle {\tfrac {\vec {n}}{c}}\cdot {\vec {x}}-t={\text{const.}}}

comprise the plane with normal vector

{\displaystyle {\vec {n}}}
. Thus, the points of equal field value of

{\displaystyle A\left({\vec {x}},t\right)}
always form a plane in space. This plane then shifts with time

with velocity c.
The term is often used to mean the special case of a monochromatic, homogeneous plane wave. A monochromatic or sine, plane wave is one in which the amplitude is a sinusoidal function of



x



{\displaystyle x\,}
and



t



{\displaystyle t\,}
. A homogeneous plane wave is one in which the planes of constant phase are perpendicular to the direction of propagation

{\displaystyle {\vec {n}}}

It is not possible in practice to have a true plane wave because it would have to fill all space and thus would require infinite energy; only a plane wave of infinite extent will propagate as a plane wave. The plane wave model is important and widely used in physics because at a sufficiently great distance, the waves emitted by any localized (limited size) source are approximately plane waves when viewed over a sufficiently small area. For example the light waves from a distant star, or the radio waves received from a distant antenna in its far-field region, are often modeled as plane waves because the receiving device, a telescope or antenna, is small enough that within its aperture the curvature of the wavefront, and thus its departure from planarity, is negligible.
