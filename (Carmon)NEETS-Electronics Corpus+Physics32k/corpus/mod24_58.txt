System design has centered on long-haul communications and the subscriber-loop plant. The
subscriber-loop plant is the part of a system that connects a subscriber to the nearest switching center.
Cable television is an example. Limited work has also been done on short-distance applications and some
military systems. Initially, central office trunking required multimode optical fibers with moderate to
good performance. Fiber performance depends on the amount of loss and signal distortion introduced by
the fiber when it is operating at a specific wavelength. Long-haul systems require single mode optical
fibers with very high performance. Single mode fibers tend to have lower loss and produce less signal
distortion.
