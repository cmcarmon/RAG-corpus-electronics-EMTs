To reduce direct glare, luminaires should be mounted as far above the normal line of sight as possible and
should  be  designed  to  limit  both  the  luminance  and  the  quality  of  light  emitted  in  the  45–85  degree  zone
because  such  light  may  interfere  with  vision.  This  precaution  includes  the  use  of  supplementary  lighting
equipment. There is such a wide divergence of tasks and environmental conditions that it may not be possible
to recommend a degree of quality satisfactory to all needs. In production areas, luminaires within the normal
ﬁeld of view should be shielded to at least 25 degrees from the horizontal, preferably to 45 degrees.
