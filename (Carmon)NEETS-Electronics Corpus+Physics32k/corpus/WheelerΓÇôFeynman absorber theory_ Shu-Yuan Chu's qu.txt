In 1993, Chu developed a model of how to do quantum mechanics in the presence of gravity, which combines some of the latest ideas in particle physics, superstrings, and a time-symmetric Wheelerâ€“Feynman description of gravity and inertia. In 1998 he extended this work to derive Einstein's equation for the "adjunct gravitational field" using concepts from statistics and maximizing the entropy.
