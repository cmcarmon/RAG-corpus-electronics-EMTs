preparing optical fibers for coupling. The score-and-break method consists of lightly scoring (nicking) the
outer surface of the optical fiber and then placing it under tension until it breaks. A heavy metal or
diamond blade is used to score the fiber. Once the scoring process is complete, fiber tension is increased
until the fiber breaks. The fiber is placed under tension either by pulling on the fiber or by bending the
fiber over a curved surface.
