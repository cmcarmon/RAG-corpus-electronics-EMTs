The principles underpinning Pantheios are:
the logging subsystem must always be available, including for use by other subsystems that may themselves act before (or after) main()
the logging subsystem must be completely robust, and should never be the cause of system failure
the logging subsystem must have extremely low cost when logging is switched off, otherwise users will make decisions about what logging information is important at compile-time, rather than at runtime
