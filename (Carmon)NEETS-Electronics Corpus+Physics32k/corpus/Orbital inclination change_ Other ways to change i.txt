Some other ways to change inclination that do not require burning propellant (or help reduce the amount of propellant required) include
aerodynamic lift (for bodies with an atmosphere, such as the Earth)
solar sails
Transits of other bodies such as the Moon can also be done.
None of these methods will change the delta-V required, they are simply alternate means of achieving the same end result and, ideally, will reduce propellant usage.
