The Planck force appears in the Einstein field equations, describing the properties of a gravitational field surrounding any given mass:





G

G

T

μ

{\displaystyle G_{\mu \nu }=8\pi {\frac {G}{c^{4}}}T_{\mu \nu }}

where




G

μ
ν




{\displaystyle G_{\mu \nu }}
is the Einstein tensor and




T

μ
ν




{\displaystyle T_{\mu \nu }}
is the energy–momentum tensor. The Planck force thus describes how much or how easily space-time is curved by a given amount of mass-energy.
Since 1993, various authors (De Sabbata & Sivaram, Massa, Kostro & Lange, Gibbons, Schiller) have argued that the Planck force is the maximum force value that can be observed in nature. This limit property is valid both for gravitational force and for any other type of force.
