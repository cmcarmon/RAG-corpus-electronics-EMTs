The phase relationships of the echoes from fixed objects to the transmitter is constant and the
amplitude of the beat signal remains constant. A beat signal of varying amplitude indicates a moving
object. This is because the phase difference between the reference oscillator signal and the echo signal
changes as the range to the reflecting object changes. The constant amplitude beat signal is filtered out in
the receiver. The beat signal of varying amplitude is sent to the radar indicator scope for display.
