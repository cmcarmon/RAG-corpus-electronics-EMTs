The simplicity of the demodulator has made conventional DSB AM a practical choice for AM
radio broadcasting. A relatively inexpensive demodulator is very important in view of the several
billions of radio receivers. With only a few broadcast transmitters and numerous receivers, the
power inefﬁciency of conventional AM is justiﬁed. Thus, it is cost-effective to construct powerful
transmitters and sacriﬁce power efﬁciency in order to have simpler signal demodulation at the
receivers.
