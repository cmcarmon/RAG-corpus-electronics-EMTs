One of the most convenient architectures for microstrip arrays is the single-layer design where the microstrip
feed lines are printed on the same substrate layer as the radiating patch elements. This results in a simple, low-
proﬁle, inexpensive, and easily fabricated antenna assembly. An example of a 2 · 4 microstrip array using this
type of conﬁguration is shown in Fig. 38.20. The microstrip feed network consists of a main feed line driving
three levels of coplanar two-way power dividers, which in turn drive eight edge-fed patches. This is an example
of a corporate feed network, in contrast to a series type of feed where array elements are tapped off of a single
microstrip line. The corporate feed provides good bandwidth and allows precise control of element excitation,
but requires considerable substrate area and can be lossy. A series feed can be very compact and efﬁcient, but
its  bandwidth  is  typically  limited  to  a  few  percent.  Both  types  of  feeds  can  be  used  for  single  and  dual
polarizations. More ﬂexibility for feed network layout can be obtained by using a two-sided aperture-coupled
patch geometry. This allows the feed network to be isolated from the radiating aperture by the ground plane,
and  the  extra  substrate  area  can  be  very  useful  for  arrays  that  require  dual  polarization  or  dual-frequency
operation.  Similar  features  can  be  obtained  by  using  feedthrough  pins  or  vias,  but  the  added  fabricational
complexity of solder connections can be formidable in a large array.
