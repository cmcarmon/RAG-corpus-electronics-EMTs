(3.3.1)
where f (t ) = 0 for t < 0, and s is a complex-frequency variable given by s = σ + j ω. The
frequency-domain function F(s) is the Laplace transform of the time-domain function f (t). When
the integral of Equation (3.3.1) is less than inﬁnity and converges, f (t) is Laplace transformable.
−st decreases rapidly, making the integral converge. The uniqueness of the
Note that for σ > 0, e
Laplace transform leads to the concept of the transform pairs,
