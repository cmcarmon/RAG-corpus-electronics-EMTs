In  either  virtual  circuit  or  datagram  networks,  packets  from  a  large  number  of  users  may  simultaneously
need transmission services between nodes. Packets arrive at a given node at random times. The switching node
determines the next node in the transmission path, and then places the packet in a queue for transmission over
a trunk facility to the next node. Packet arrival processes tend to be bursty, that is, the number of packet arrivals
over ﬁxed-length intervals of time has a large variance. Because of the burstiness of the arrival process, packets
may experience signiﬁcant delays at the trunks. Queues may also build due to the difference in transmission
capacities  of  the  various  trunks  and  access  lines.  Combining  of  packets  that  arrive  at  random  times  from
different users onto the same line, in this case a trunk, is called statistical multiplexing.
