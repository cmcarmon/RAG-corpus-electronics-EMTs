This completes the analysis of the two-resistor voltage divider.
From the results of this analysis it should be apparent why the circuit in
Figure 2.31 is called a voltage divider. Notice that v2 is some fraction (specifically,
R2/(R1+R2)) of the source voltage V, as desired. The fraction is the ratio of the
resistance about which the voltage is measured and the sum of the resistances.
By adjusting the relative values of R1 and R2 we can make this fraction adjust
anywhere from 0 to 1. If, for example, we wish v2 to be one-tenth of V,
as suggested at the start of this example, then R1 should be nine times as
big as R2.
Notice also that v1 + v2 = V, and that the two resistors divide the voltage
V in proportion to their resistances since v1/v2 = R1/R2. For example, if R1 is
twice R2 then v1 is twice v2.
