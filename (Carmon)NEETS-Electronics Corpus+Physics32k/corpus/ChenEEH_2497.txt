Judging from their circuit functionality, passive components
can be classiﬁed into the following categories: impedance
matching/transformer, power dividing/combining, signal
rerouting/coupling, frequency ﬁlter/resonator, and phase
delay/shifter. Among them, ﬁlters are a special and very im-
portant class of passive components because of their technical
scope and design complexity. Hybrids and directional couplers
are no less important but their realization spans a much
smaller range than that of ﬁlters. Impedance matching or
transformer networks are considered the most fundamental
building blocks for nearly any microwave circuit. Possible
realizations are strongly dependent on the circuit environment,
and stand-alone components are not possible unless they are
