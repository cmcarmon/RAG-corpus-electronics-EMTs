The functional blocks of a ﬂash A/D converter are shown in Fig. 32.2. The circuitry consists of a precision
– 1 analog comparators, and a digital priority encoder. The resistor network estab-
resistor ladder network, 2
lishes threshold voltages for each allowed quantization level. The analog comparators indicate whether or not
the input analog voltage is above or below the threshold at each level. The output of the analog comparators
is input to the digital priority encoder. The priority encoder produces the ﬁnal digital output code that is stored
in an output latch.
