PHASE or PHASE ANGLE indicates how much of a cycle has been completed at any given instant. 
This merely describes the angle that exists between the starting point of the vector and its position at that 
instant. The number of degrees of vector rotation and the number of degrees of the resultant sine wave 
that have been completed will be the same. For example, at time position 2 of figure 1-3, the vector has 
rotated to 60 degrees and 60 degrees of the resultant sine wave has been completed. Therefore, both are 
said to have an instantaneous phase angle of 60 degrees.
