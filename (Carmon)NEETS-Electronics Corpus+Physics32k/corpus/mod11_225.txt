Proper phasing between the pump and the input signal is crucial in this circuit. The electrical pump 
action is simply a sine-wave voltage applied to a varactor located in a resonant cavity. For proper 
operation, the capacitance must be decreased when the input voltage is maximum and increased when the 
input voltage is minimum. In other words, the pump signal frequency must be exactly double the 
frequency of the input signal. This relationship can be seen when you compare views (B) and (C). A 
parametric amplifier of the type shown in figure 2-44 is quite phase-sensitive. The input signal and the 
capacitor variation are often in the wrong phase for long periods of time.
