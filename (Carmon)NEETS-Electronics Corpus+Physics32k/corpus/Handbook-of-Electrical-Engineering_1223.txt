Signal restoration algorithm (14.99) has been applied to many fundamental signal processing problems. It
has produced effective results that often exceed those achieved by more traditional methods. The ultimate utility
of signal restoration is dependent on the userâ€™s innovativeness in generating signal attributes that distinguish
the underlying signal from the corruption in the data. In many applications, matrix descriptions of the data
under analysis arise in a natural manner. With this in mind, we will now explore some salient matrix properties
and how they can be used in typical signal restoration applications.
