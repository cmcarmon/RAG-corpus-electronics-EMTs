A very important measurement in many liquid chemical processes (industrial, pharmaceutical,
manufacturing, food production, etc.) is that of pH: the measurement of hydrogen ion concen-
tration in a liquid solution. A solution with a low pH value is called an ”acid,” while one with a
high pH is called a ”caustic.” The common pH scale extends from 0 (strong acid) to 14 (strong
caustic), with 7 in the middle representing pure water (neutral):
