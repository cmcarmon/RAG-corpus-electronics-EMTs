Emitter-Coupled Logic
ECL  is  a  nonsaturated  logic  family  where  saturation  is  avoided  by  operating  the  transistors  in  the  common
collector conﬁguration. This feature, in combination with a smaller difference between the HIGH and LOW
voltage levels (less than 1 V) than other logic families, makes ECL the fastest logic available at this time. The
circuit  diagram  of  a  widely  used  version  of  the  basic  two-input  ECL  gate  is  given  in  Fig. 79.12.  The  power
supply terminals VCC1, VCC2, VEE, and VTT are available for ﬂexibility in biasing. In normal operation, VCC1 and
VCC2 are connected to a common ground, VEE is biased to –5.2 V, and VTT is biased to –2 V. With these values
the nominal voltage for the logical 0 and 1 are, respectively, –1.75 and –0.9 V. Operation with the VCC terminals
grounded maximizes the immunity from noise interference.
