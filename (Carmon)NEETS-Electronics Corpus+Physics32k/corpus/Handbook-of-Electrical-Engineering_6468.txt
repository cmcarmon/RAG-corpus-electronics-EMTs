Interference Rejection.
In  addition  to  providing  multiple  accessing  capability,  spread  spectrum  techniques
are  of  interest  in  the  commercial  sector  for  basically  the  same  reasons  they  are  in  the  military  community,
namely their AJ and LPI characteristics. However, the motivations for such interest differ. For example, whereas
the  military  is  interested  in  ensuring  that  systems  they  deploy  are  robust  to  interference  generated  by  an
intelligent adversary (i.e., exhibit jamming resistance), the interference of concern in commercial applications
is unintentional. It is sometimes referred to as co-channel interference (CCI) and arises naturally as the result
of  many  services  using  the  same  frequency  band  at  the  same  time. And  while  such  scenarios  almost  always
allow for some type of spatial isolation between the interfering waveforms, such as the use of narrow-beam
antenna patterns, at times the use of the inherent interference suppression property of a spread spectrum signal
is also desired. Similarly, whereas the military is very much interested in the LPI property of a spread spectrum
waveform, as indicated in Sec. 70.3, there are applications in the commercial segment where the same charac-
teristic can be used to advantage.
