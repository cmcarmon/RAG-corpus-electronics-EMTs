STVG/MOG has been applied successfully to a range of astronomical, astrophysical, and cosmological phenomena.
On the scale of the Solar System, the theory predicts no deviation from the results of Newton and Einstein. This is also true for star clusters containing no more than a maximum of a few million solar masses.
The theory accounts for the rotation curves of spiral galaxies, correctly reproducing the Tully-Fisher law.
STVG is in good agreement with the mass profiles of galaxy clusters.
STVG can also account for key cosmological observations, including:
The acoustic peaks in the cosmic microwave background radiation;
The accelerating expansion of the universe that is apparent from type Ia supernova observations;
The matter power spectrum of the universe that is observed in the form of galaxy-galaxy correlations.
