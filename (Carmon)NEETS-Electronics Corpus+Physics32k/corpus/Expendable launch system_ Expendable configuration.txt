Some reusable launch vehicles are, on occasion, launched to orbit in "expendable configuration." For example, EchoStar 23 was launched to orbit in March 2017 on an RLV Falcon 9 where the first stage carried no grid fins nor landing legs, and used all of the requisite propellant for landing to impart additional energy to the heavy mass of the large commsat payload being transported to geosynchronous orbit.
