If the parameter optimization, or parameter reﬁnement such as to lead to maximum phase margin, approach
shows the speciﬁcations cannot be met, we are then assured that no equalizer of the speciﬁc form selected will
meet  speciﬁcations.  The  next  design  step,  if  needed,  would  consist  of  modiﬁcation  of  the  equalizer  form  or
