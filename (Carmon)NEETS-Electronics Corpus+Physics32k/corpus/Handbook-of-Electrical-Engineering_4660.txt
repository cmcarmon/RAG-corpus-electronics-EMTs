C
 = electrode pair capacitance per unit
and where the following deﬁnitions are 
s
.  This  is  the  general  form  for  a  uniform
length  (pf/cm-pair),  and 
beam  transducer  with  arbitrary  electrode  spacing.  For  a  uniform  beam  transducer  with  periodic  electrode
spacing, fi(t) = f0 and sin q(t) = sin wt. This expression relates a time response to the physical device parameters
of the material coupling coefﬁcient and the electrode capacitance.
