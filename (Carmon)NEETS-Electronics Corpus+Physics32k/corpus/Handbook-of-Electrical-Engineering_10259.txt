Power
Aircraft  power  is  generally  of  two  types:  28  vdc,  and  115  vac,  400  Hz.  Some  270  vdc  is  also  used  on  military
aircraft. Aircraft  power  is  of  poor  quality  when  compared  to  power  for  most  other  electronics.  Under  normal
conditions, there can be transients of up to 100% of the supply voltage and power interruptions of up to 1 second.
This poor quality places severe design requirements on the avionics power supply, especially where the avionics
are performing a full-time, ï¬‚ight-critical function. Back-up power sources include ram air turbines and batteries,
although batteries require very rigorous maintenance practices to guarantee long-term reliable performance.
