It should be noted that some automobiles use inexpensive devices known as fusible links for
overcurrent protection in the battery charging circuit, due to the expense of a properly-rated
fuse and holder. A fusible link is a primitive fuse, being nothing more than a short piece of
rubber-insulated wire designed to melt open in the event of overcurrent, with no hard sheath-
ing of any kind. Such crude and potentially dangerous devices are never used in industry or
even residential power use, mainly due to the greater voltage and current levels encountered.
As far as this author is concerned, their application even in automotive circuits is questionable.
