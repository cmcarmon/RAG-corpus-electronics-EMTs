An integer linear programming (ILP) formulation that
yields tight bounds on the quality of the achievable wire-
packing solution was
formulated by Kay and Rutenbar
(2001). The input to cross talk-aware wire packing is com-
posed of a set of wires, a set of variable tracks (per layer), and a
cross talk graph XG that determines forbidden wire adjacen-
cies. The output is a legal assignment such that no forbidden
adjacencies and no electrical shorts exist, as shown in Figure
8.11. The key technical insight is to model all constraints (both
geometric and cross talk conﬂicts) as cliques in an appropriate
conﬂict graph; these cliques can be extracted quickly from the
interval structure of the slice.
