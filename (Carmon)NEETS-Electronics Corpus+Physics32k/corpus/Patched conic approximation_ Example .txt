On an Earth-to-Mars transfer, a hyperbolic trajectory is required to escape from Earth's gravity well, then an elliptic or hyperbolic trajectory in the Sun's sphere of influence is required to transfer from Earth's sphere of influence to that of Mars, etc. By patching these conic sections together—matching the position and velocity vectors between segments—the appropriate mission trajectory can be found.
