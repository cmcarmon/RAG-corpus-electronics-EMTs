Similarity Measures and Clustering
Underlying all statistical pattern matching problems is the
need to have objective measures of similarity among objects
and the related problem of grouping objects into clusters
whose elements are similar in some sense. Here, we touch on
four interrelated classes of pattern-matching problems that
occur in speciÔ¨Åc contexts in speech processing. We return to
the clustering problem at the end of the section.
