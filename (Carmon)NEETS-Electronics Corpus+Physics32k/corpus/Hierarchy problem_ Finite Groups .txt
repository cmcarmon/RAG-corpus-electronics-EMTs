It has also been noted that the group order of the Baby Monster group is of the right order of magnitude, 4×1033. It is known that the Monster Group is related to the symmetries of a particular bosonic string theory on the Leech lattice. However, there's no physical reason for why the size of the Monster Group or its subgroups should appear in the Lagrangian. Most physicists think this is merely a coincidence. Another coincidence is that in reduced Planck units, the Higgs mass is approximately



48.

where |M| is the order of the Monster group. This suggests that the smallness of the Higgs mass may be due to a redundancy caused by a symmetry of the extra dimensions, which must be divided out. There are other groups that are also of the right order of magnitude for example
