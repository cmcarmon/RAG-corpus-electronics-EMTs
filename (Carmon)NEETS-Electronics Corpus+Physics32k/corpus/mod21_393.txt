Various frequency counters have found application as an ELECTRONIC TACHOMETER to obtain 
accurate measurements of high-speed rotating machinery. A tachometer pickup may be used to produce 
signals that are fed directly to the frequency counter. If the tachometer pickup is designed to generate 1 
signal per revolution, the counter will indicate directly in revolutions per second; if the pickup is designed 
to produce 60 signals per revolution, the counter will indicate directly in revolutions per minute.
