A circuit composed of two sine-wave generators, G1 and G2, and two linear impedances, Z1 and Z2, 
is shown in figure 1-13. The voltage applied to Z1 and Z2 will be the vector sum of the generator 
voltages. The sum of the individual instantaneous voltages across each impedance will equal the applied 
voltages.
