The  rotors  depicted  in  Figs.  66.1  and  66.2  are  salient  since  the  poles  are  protruding  from  the  shaft.  Such
structures are mechanically weak, since at a high speed (3600 rpm and 1800 rpm, respectively) the centrifugal
force becomes a serious problem. Practically, for high-speed turbines, round-rotor (or cylindrical-rotor) struc-
tures  are  preferred.  The  cross  section  of  a  two-pole,  round-rotor  machine  is  depicted  in  Fig.  66.3.  From  a
practical viewpoint, salient rotors are easier to build because each pole and its winding can be manufactured
separately and then mounted on the rotor shaft. For round rotors, slots need to be reserved in the rotor where
the windings can be placed.
