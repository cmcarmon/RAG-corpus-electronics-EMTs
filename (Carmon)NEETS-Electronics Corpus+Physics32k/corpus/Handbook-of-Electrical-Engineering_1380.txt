where Zn and Vn denote the nth spectral components of the noisy signal and the noise process, respectively,
and a > 0, b â€¡ 0, c > 0. The MMSE gain function is obtained when a = 2, b = 1, and c = 1. Another commonly
used gain function in the spectral subtraction approach is obtained from using a = 2, b = 1, and c = 1/2. This
gain function results from estimating the spectral magnitude of the signal and combining the resulting estimate
with the phase of the noisy signal. This choice of gain function is motivated by the relative importance of the
spectral magnitude of the signal compared to its phase. Since both cannot be simultaneously optimally estimated
[Ephraim, 1992], only the spectral magnitude is optimally estimated, and combined with an estimate of the
complex exponential of the phase which does not affect the spectral magnitude estimate. The resulting estimate
