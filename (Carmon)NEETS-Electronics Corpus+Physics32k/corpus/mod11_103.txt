The two-cavity klystron in figure 2-7A and B may be used either as an oscillator or an amplifier. The 
configuration shown in the figure is correct for oscillator operation. The feedback path provides energy of 
the proper delay and phase relationship to sustain oscillations. A signal applied at the buncher grids will 
be amplified if the feedback path is removed.
