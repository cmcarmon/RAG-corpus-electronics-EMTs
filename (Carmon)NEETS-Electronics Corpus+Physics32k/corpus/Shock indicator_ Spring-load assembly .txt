Spring-load type shock indicators involve a simple extensible spring with a load attached to one end. Small shocks cause only temporary excursions of the load from its resting position following Hooke's law. A shock strong enough to stretch the spring beyond its elastic limit will lead to an irreversible deformation of the spring, thus providing a permanent indication that such a shock was experienced by the system. The critical acceleration at which the elastic limit is reached can be tuned by carefully choosing the material and shape of the spring, as well as the mass of the load.
