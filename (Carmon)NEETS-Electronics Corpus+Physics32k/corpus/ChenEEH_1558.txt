Among these components, the two most important ones are
knowledge base and inference engine. The knowledge base
contains formally encoded domain-speciﬁc knowledge of a
problem, whereas the inference engine solves problems using
various reasoning algorithms. To achieve expert-level perfor-
mance, expert systems need to access a substantial amount of
domain knowledge and to apply the knowledge efﬁciently
through one or several reasoning mechanisms.
