The principle that ”current kills” is essentially correct. It is electric current that burns
tissue, freezes muscles, and ﬁbrillates hearts. However, electric current doesn’t just occur on
its own: there must be voltage available to motivate electrons to ﬂow through a victim. A
person’s body also presents resistance to current, which must be taken into account.
