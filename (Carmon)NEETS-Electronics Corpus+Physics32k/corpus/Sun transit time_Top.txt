The sun transit time, also referred to as Sunâ€“meridian transit time, is the daily moment when the Sun culminates on the observer's meridian, reaching its highest position in the sky. This solar time is most often used as local noon and therefore will vary with longitude. For example, on April 29, the sun transit time in Boston, Massachusetts is 12:42 p.m., whereas that for New York, New York is 12:53 p.m. This is due to longitudinal distance between the two cities.
