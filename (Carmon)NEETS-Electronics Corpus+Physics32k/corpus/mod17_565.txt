A block diagram of a doubled-up transmitter is shown in figure 5-1. Remember, bands of medium 
frequencies and below are used almost exclusively for broadcast and are on the air continuously. 
Doubling up increases reliability. As you can see, two transmitters are located in the same equipment 
cabinet. This allows you to quickly transfer circuits if one should fail. This dual installation also allows 
both amplifiers to be used together to double the output power. When you use this application, you 
sacrifice the doubling-up capability of only the power amplifier. All the other components are still 
available as backups. Let's go through figure 5-1 and describe the block functions.
