Prototyping	is	the	ability	to	put	a	particular	idea	to	test	by	preparing	a	model	from
which	other	circuits	are	developed.	Especially	when	the	circuit	in	subject	involves
a	complex	system	or	expensive	components,	a	prototype	is	initially	designed.
If	the	circuit	creator	is	unsure	of	how	a	particular	circuit	will	function,	his	best	bet
is	to	create	a	prototype.	This	way,	he	can	evaluate	his	creation	and	see	how	it	can
be	improved.	If	itâ€™s	not	yielding	his	desired	results,	he	can	modify	the	placements
of	each	of	its	components	until	he	achieves	a	necessary	output.	Otherwise,	he	can
proceed	to	the	actual	circuit-making	process.
