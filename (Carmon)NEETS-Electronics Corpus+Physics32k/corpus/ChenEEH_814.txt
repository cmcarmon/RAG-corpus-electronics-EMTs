The increasing complexity of information processing products
and the pressure of design to market requirements are the
main reasons for a change in the design process of these
products, resulting in an emphasis of timely design validation
of virtual prototypes instead of breadboarding. This reveals
possible concept errors long before an implementation of real
prototypes. On the other hand, such products are too complex
to be modeled at lower (i.e., more accurate) abstraction levels.
A need for a sensible mix of models on different abstraction
levels thus arises and results in the necessity to represent and to
execute models both in different domains and at several ab-
straction levels. The purpose of such a system model, known as
virtual prototype, is to support an assessment of the concep-
tualization and the reﬁnement according to the design ﬂow
outlined in Figure 3.1 in terms of meeting initial target speci-
ﬁcations. The process of model deﬁnition, reﬁnement, and
assessment is demonstrated in the following by means of a
depth gauge, a safety critical device for deep water divers.
