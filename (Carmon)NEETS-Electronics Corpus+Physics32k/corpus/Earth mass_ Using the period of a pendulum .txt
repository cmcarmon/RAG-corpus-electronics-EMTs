An expedition from 1737 to 1740 by French scientist Pierre Bouguer attempted to determine the density of Earth by measuring the period of a pendulum (and therefore the strength of gravity) as a function of elevation. The experiments were carried out in Ecuador and Peru, on Pichincha Volcano and mount Chimborazo. Bouguer's work led to an estimate that is two to three times larger than the true mass of Earth. However, this historical determination showed that the Earth was not hollow nor filled with water, as some had argued at the time. Modern gravitometers are now used for measuring the local gravitational field. They surpass the accuracy limitations of pendulums.
