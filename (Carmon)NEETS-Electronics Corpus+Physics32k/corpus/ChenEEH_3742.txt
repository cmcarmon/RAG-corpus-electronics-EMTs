15 Normalization of path lengths (i.e., sum of the transition costs along a
path) is required to prevent undue penalty to longer reference strings. In a DP
algorithm, where optimization is done locally, a path-dependent normalization
is clearly inappropriate, and we must resort to the use of an arbitrary normal-
ization factor (Myers et al., 1980).
