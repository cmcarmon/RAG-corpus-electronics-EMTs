(see Figure 2.9) (Kim et al., 1998; Kirihata et al., 1998). So the
low-power operation per bit is only feasible when the chips
operate in burst mode with entire (parts of) memory
column(s) transferred over the external bus. This is not di-
rectly compatible with the actual use of the data in the proces-
sor data paths, so without a buffer to the processors, most of
the data words that are exchanged would be useless (and
discarded). Obviously, the effective energy consumption per
useful bit becomes very high in that case, and the effective
bandwidth is low.
