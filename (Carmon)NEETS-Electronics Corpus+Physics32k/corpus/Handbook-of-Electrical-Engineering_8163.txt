In order to improve contrast, the usual technique is to use an absorbing faceplate or spectrally matched ﬁlter
to absorb the light emitted by the luminescent screen once and the ambient incident light twice. In addition,
antireﬂection coatings and antiglare treatments can be applied to the CRT face to reduce the reﬂections from
the  front  surface.  Depending  upon  the  ambient  lighting  conditions,  a  compromise  must  usually  be  found
between light output required and the contrast need.
