In non-technical terms, M-theory presents an idea about the basic substance of the universe. So far no experimental evidence exists showing that M-theory is a description of the real world. Nevertheless, it is the leading contender for a universal "Theory of Everything" that unifies gravity with other forces such as electromagnetism: M-theory is the only theory known to elegantly unify quantum mechanics with general relativity's gravitational force in a mathematically consistent way. In comparison, other theories such as loop quantum gravity are considered less elegant because they posit gravity to be completely different from forces such as the electromagnetic force.
