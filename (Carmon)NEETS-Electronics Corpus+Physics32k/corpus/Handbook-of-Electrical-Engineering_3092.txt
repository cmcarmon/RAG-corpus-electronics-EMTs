A negative resistor is an electronic circuit that acts like a resistor having a negative value of resistance. The
inverting  GIC  can  be  used  to  design  a  negative  resistor  by  taking  ZA(s)  =  RA,  ZB(s)  =  RB,  and  Z2(s)  =  R2.
Figure 29.25(a)  shows  the  op  amp  circuit  that  implements  a  negative  resistor,  and  Fig.  29.25(b)  shows  the
equivalent circuit. The resistance of the negative resistor is given by
