11.5.4 A single-line diagram of a three-phase trans-
former bank connected to a load is given in
Figure P11.5.4. Find the magnitudes of the line-
to-line voltages, line currents, phase voltages,
and phase currents on either side of the trans-
former bank. Determine the primary to secondary
ratio of the line-to-line voltages and the line cur-
rents.
