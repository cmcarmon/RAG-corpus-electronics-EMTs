4.3.4 Two wattmeters are used, as shown in Figure 4.3.1,
to measure the power absorbed by a balanced
delta-connected load. Determine the total power in
kW, the power factor, and the per-phase impedance
of the load if the supply-system voltage is 120 V
and the wattmeter readings are given by
(a) WA = −500 W, and WC = 1300 W.
(b) WA = 1300 W, and WC = −500 W.
