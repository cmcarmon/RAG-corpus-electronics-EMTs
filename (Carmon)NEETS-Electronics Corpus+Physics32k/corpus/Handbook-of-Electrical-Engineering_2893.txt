in the oven, initial proﬁle setting should rely heavily on information from the solder paste vendor, as well as
the oven manufacturer. Remember that the proﬁle shown is the proﬁle to be developed on the substrate, and
the actual control settings in various stages of the oven itself may be considerably different, depending on the
thermal inertia of the product in the oven and the heating characteristics of the particular oven being used.
This should be determined not by the oven settings but by instrumenting actual circuit boards with thermo-
couples  and  determining  that  the  proﬁles  at  various  locations  on  the  circuit  board  meet  the  speciﬁcations
necessary for good soldering.
