Cell splitting:
When  a  cell  provides  a  maximum  of  60  radio  channels  and  all  are  used  during  busy
hours, the cell has to be split into smaller cells in order to provide more radio channels, normally reducing
the cell by using a half radius. As a result a cell will be covered by four subcells. Each subcell provides
60 channels. The total area of an original cell will provide 240 radio channels which is four times higher
in capacity as compared with the original cell capacity before splitting.
