Thermal effects are an inseparable aspect of electrical power
distribution and signal transmission through the interconnects
due to self-heating (or joule heating) caused by the ï¬‚ow of
current. Thermal effects impact interconnect design and reli-
ability in the following ways. First, they limit the maximum
allowable RMS current density (since the RMS value of the
current density is responsible for heat generation) in the inter-
connects to limit the temperature increase. Second, intercon-
nect lifetime (reliability), which is limited by electromigration
(EM) (transport of mass in metals under an applied current
density), has an exponential dependence on the inverse metal
temperature. Hence, temperature rise of metal interconnects
due to self-heating phenomena can also limit the maximum
allowed average current density because EM capability is
dependent on the average current density (Liew et al., 1990).
Third, thermally induced open-circuit metal failure under
short-time high peak currents (including ESD) is also a reliabil-
ity concern (Banerjee et al., 1997) and can introduce latent EM
damage that has important reliability implications (Banerjee
et al., 1996). It has been argued that thermal effects will increas-
ingly dominate interconnect design rules that specify maximum
current densities for circuit designers (Chatterjee et al., 1995).
Recently, Hunter (1997) has followed up on this issue by solving
the EM lifetime equation for Al-Cu and the ID heat equation in
a self-consistent manner. In this approach, both EM and self-
heating can be comprehended simultaneously.
