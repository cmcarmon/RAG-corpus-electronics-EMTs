Because capacitors store the potential energy of accumulated electrons in the form of an
electric ﬁeld, they behave quite differently than resistors (which simply dissipate energy in the
form of heat) in a circuit. Energy storage in a capacitor is a function of the voltage between the
plates, as well as other factors which we will discuss later in this chapter. A capacitor’s ability
to store energy as a function of voltage (potential difference between the two leads) results in
a tendency to try to maintain voltage at a constant level. In other words, capacitors tend to
resist changes in voltage drop. When voltage across a capacitor is increased or decreased, the
capacitor ”resists” the change by drawing current from or supplying current to the source of
the voltage change, in opposition to the change.
