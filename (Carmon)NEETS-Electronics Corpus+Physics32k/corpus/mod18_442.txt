Because of the complexity of most radar systems, trying to detail step-by-step procedures for specific 
maintenance actions in this chapter is impractical. However, the basic procedures for some maintenance 
actions that are common to most radar systems will be discussed. Also, an overview of support systems 
for radars will be presented. This will include electrical power, dry-air systems, and liquid cooling 
systems. Finally, safety precautions inherent to radars are listed.
