Another observation concerns the short-time behavior of the circuit. We
have seen in Chapter 10 that the transient behavior of an uncharged capacitor is
to act as a short circuit during the early part of a transient, while the correspond-
ing transient behavior of an uncharged inductor is to act as an open circuit. This
