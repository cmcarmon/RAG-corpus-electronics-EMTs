This coin-ﬂipping model assumes that symbols occur without regard to what preceding or succeeding symbols
were, a false assumption for typed text. Despite this probabilistic model’s over-simplicity, the ideas we
develop here also work when more accurate, but still probabilistic, models are used. The key quantity that
characterizes a symbolic-valued signal is the entropy of its alphabet.
