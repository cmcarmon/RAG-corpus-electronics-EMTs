provided the material of the cylinder is electrically homogeneous and isotropic. In Eq. (113.17) r < R is the
distance from the center of the cylinder and f^
is a unit vector in the circumferential direction. For magnetic
ﬁelds  varying  sinusoidally  as  B0  cos  wt, 
. Since  most  biological  objects  are  neither
homogeneous nor isotropic, the actual induced electric ﬁelds at various points in the tissue or cells may deviate
substantially  from  the  values  given  by  Eq.  (113.17)  [Polk  and  Song,  1990;  Van  Amelsfort,  1990].  Equation
(113.17) is useful only for estimating the spatial average value of the induced electric ﬁeld, which depends in
the  bone  environment  on  the  point-to-point  variation  of  the  electrical  properties  of  muscle,  fat,  cartilage,
periosteum (outer bone membrane), and bone marrow.
