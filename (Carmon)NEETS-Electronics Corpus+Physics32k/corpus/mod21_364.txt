The static calorimeter uses a thermally shielded body. Since an isolated body loses little heat to a 
surrounding medium, the temperature increase of the body is in direct proportion to the time of applied 
power. The product of the rate of temperature rise in the calorimetric body and its heat capacity equals 
applied power. Figure 3-18 illustrates a static-type calorimeter.
