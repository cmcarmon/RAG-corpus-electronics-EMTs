Actually, the first step in loading instructions and data into a computer is to manually place enough 
instructions into memory using the keyboard or electronically using an operating system (discussed in 
chapter 1), so that these instructions can be used to bring in more instructions as desired. In this manner a 
few instructions are used to bootstrap more instructions. Some computers make use of an auxiliary 
(wired) memory that permanently stores the bootstrap program, thereby making manual loading 
unnecessary.
