• Steady state (DC), used to calculate characteristic curves of MOSFETs, BJTs diodes, etc.
• AC analysis, used to calculate capacitances, Y-parameters, small signal gains, and S-parameters.
• Transient analysis used for calculation of switching and large signal behavior, and special types of analysis
