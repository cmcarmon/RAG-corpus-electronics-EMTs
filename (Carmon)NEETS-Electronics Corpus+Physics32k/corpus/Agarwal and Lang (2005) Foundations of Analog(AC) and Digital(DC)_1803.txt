Next, we obtain additional information by writing the characteristic equa-
tion for the circuit. A simple method for writing the characteristic equation by
inspection will be discussed in Sections 14.1.2 and Section 14.2 in Chapter 14.
That method will be based on the impedance approach, which will be discussed
in Chapters 13 and 14. For now, proceeding based on what we know thus far,
we can obtain the characteristic equation by writing the differential equation for
the system with the drive set to zero,
