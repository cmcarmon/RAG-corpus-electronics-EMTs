Once a program reaches the testing stage, generally, it has proved it will run and produce output. The 
purpose of testing is to determine that all data can be processed correctly and that the output is correct. 
The testing process involves processing input test data that will produce known results. The test data 
should include: (1) typical data, which will test the commonly used program paths; (2) unusual but valid 
data, which will test the program paths used to process exceptions; (3) incorrect, incomplete, or 
inappropriate data, which will test the program's error routines. If the program does not pass these tests, 
more testing is required. You will have to examine the errors and review the coding to make the coding 
corrections needed. When the program passes these tests, it is ready for computer implementation. Before 
computer implementation takes place, documentation must be completed.
