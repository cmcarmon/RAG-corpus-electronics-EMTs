In quantum field theory, a non-topological soliton (NTS) is a field configuration possessing, contrary to a topological one, a conserved Noether charge and stable against transformation into usual particles of this field for the following reason. For fixed charge Q, the mass sum of Q free particles exceeds the energy (mass) of the NTS so that the latter is energetically favorable to exist.
The interior region of an NTS is occupied by vacuum different from the ambient vacuum. The vacuums are separated by the surface of the NTS representing a domain wall configuration (topological defect), which also appears in field theories with broken discrete symmetry. Infinite domain walls contradict cosmology, but the surface of an NTS is closed and finite, so its existence would not be contradictory. If the topological domain wall is closed, it shrinks because of wall tension; however, due to the structure of the NTS surface, it does not shrink since the decrease of the NTS volume would increase its energy.
