Having  introduced  the  basic  architectural  structure  of  communication  networks,  we  will  next  turn  to  a
 (LAN). Discussion
discussion of an important variation on this architectural scheme: the 
of this topic is important because it helps to illustrate what the reference model is and what it is not. In particular,
the architecture of LANs illustrates how the ISORM can be adapted for specialized purposes. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, early
network architectures anticipate networks in which individual node pairs are interconnected via a single link,
and connections through the network are formed by concatenating node-to-node connections.
