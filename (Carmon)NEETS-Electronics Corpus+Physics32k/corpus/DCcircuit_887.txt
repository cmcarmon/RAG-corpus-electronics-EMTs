Because thermocouple junctions produce such low voltages, it is imperative that wire con-
nections be very clean and tight for accurate and reliable operation. Also, the location of the
reference junction (the place where the dissimilar-metal thermocouple wires join to standard
copper) must be kept close to the measuring instrument, to ensure that the instrument can
accurately compensate for reference junction temperature. Despite these seemingly restrictive
requirements, thermocouples remain one of the most robust and popular methods of industrial
temperature measurement in modern use.
