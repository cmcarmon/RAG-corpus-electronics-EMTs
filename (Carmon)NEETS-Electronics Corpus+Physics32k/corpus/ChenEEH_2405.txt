It may also be useful to ﬁnd the ratio of the power density
Pd(r, u, f) from a given antenna to that ( ¼ P0
d(iso)) from an
ideal
isotropic radiator when supplied by the same input
power Pin in both cases (unlike the same Prad considered in
the last section.) The ratio of Pd(r, u, f) to P0
d(iso) is called the
gain function G(u, f):
