In the Middle Ages, a British penny's weight was literally, as well as monetarily, ​1⁄20 of an ounce and ​1⁄240 of a pound of sterling silver.  At that time, the pound in use was the Tower pound, equal to 7,680 Tower grains (also known as wheat grains).  The medieval English pennyweight was thus equal to 32 Tower grains.  When Troy weights replaced Tower weights in 1527, the Troy weights were defined in such a way that the old Tower pound came out to exactly 5400 Troy grains (also known as barleycorns), the Tower pennyweight ​22 1⁄2 Troy grains (and thus approximately 1.46 grams).  After 1527, the English pennyweight was the Troy pennyweight.  The value of the pound, ounce, and pennyweight did not change.  Their definitions were given in terms of the Troy grain instead of in terms of the Tower grain.
