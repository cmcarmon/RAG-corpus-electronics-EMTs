Decision Trees
The purpose of the decision tree is to map a large number of conditions (i.e., phonetic contexts) to a small
manageable number of equivalence classes. Each terminal node of the tree represents a set of phonetic contexts.
The aim in decision tree construction is to ﬁnd the best possible deﬁnition of equivalence classes [2].
