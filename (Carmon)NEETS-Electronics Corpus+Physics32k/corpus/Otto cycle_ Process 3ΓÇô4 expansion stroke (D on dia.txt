The increased high pressure exerts a force on the piston and pushes it towards the BDC. Expansion of working fluid takes place isentropically and work is done by the system on the piston. The volume ratio

{\displaystyle V_{4}/V_{3}}
is called the "isentropic expansion ratio". (For the Otto cycle is the same as the compression ratio

). Mechanically this is the expansion of the hot gaseous mixture in the cylinder known as expansion (power) stroke.
