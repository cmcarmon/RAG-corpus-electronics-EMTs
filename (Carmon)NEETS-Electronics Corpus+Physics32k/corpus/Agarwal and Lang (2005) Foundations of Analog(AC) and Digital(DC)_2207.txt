b) Next, determine whether there will be any problems in selecting resistor values R1
and R2 to meet the specifications for your particular application. You should draw
on experience with Op Amp limitations. Can you meet the specs?
(Note: Part (a) is easy. Part (b) is endless, so look only for the larger issues, that is,
major sources of error or failure.
