Referring to Figure 7.20, if a fundamental TE10 wave is
incident at port 4, the electric ﬁeld shows even symmetry at
the mid-plane and, hence, no power is directed into port 3
because the electric ﬁeld is in the opposite direction and
cancels out. The coplanar arms 1 and 2 receive equal powers
that appear in phase at both ports if the arm lengths are equal.
