Many of the concepts and techniques used may be similar to those already developed earlier
in the book. Indeed, any discussion of control methodology integrates much of the material
on circuits, electronic devices, and electromechanical energy-conversion devices. Such control
techniques are also employed in business, ecological, and social systems, as well as in problem
areas related to inventory control, economic models, health-care delivery systems, and urban
planning.
