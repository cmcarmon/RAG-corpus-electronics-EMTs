Ideally, the memory system must be both inﬁnitely large so that it can contain an arbitrarily large amount
of information and inﬁnitely fast so that it does not limit the processing unit. Practically, however, this is not
possible.  There  are  three  properties  of  memory  that  are  inherently  in  conﬂict:  speed,  capacity,  and  cost.  In
general, technology tradeoffs can be employed to optimize any two of the three factors at the expense of the
third. Thus it is possible to have memories that are (1) large and cheap, but not fast; (2) cheap and fast, but
small;  or  (3)  large  and  fast,  but  expensive.  The  last  of  the  three  is  further  limited  by  physical  constraints. A
large-capacity memory that is very fast is also physically large, and speed-of-light delays place a limit on the
speed of such a memory system.
