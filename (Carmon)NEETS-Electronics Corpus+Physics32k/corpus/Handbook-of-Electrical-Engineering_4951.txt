Typically, a pyroelectric detector element will consist of a thin chip of the pyroelectric material cut perpen-
dicular to the polar axis of the material, electroded with a conducting material such as an evaporated metal
and connected to a low-noise, high-input impedance ampliﬁer—for example, a junction ﬁeld-effect transistor
(JFET)  or  metal-oxide  gate  transistor  (MOSFET)—as  shown  in  Fig.  54.1.  In  some  devices,  the  radiation  is
absorbed  directly  in  the  element.  In  this  case  the  front  electrode  will  be  a  thin  metal  layer  matched  to  the
/square. However, in most high-perfor-
permittivity of free space with an electrical surface resistivity of 367 
mance  devices,  the  element  is  coated  with  a  layer  designed  to  absorb  the  radiation  of  interest.  The  element
itself must be thin to minimize the thermal mass and, in most cases, well isolated thermally from its environ-
ment. These measures are designed to increase the temperature change for a given amount of energy absorbed
and thus the electrical signal generated. The necessary modulation of the radiation ﬂux can be achieved either
by deliberately only “looking” for moving objects or other radiation sources (e.g., ﬂickering ﬂames for a ﬂame
detector) or by interposing a mechanical radiation “chopper” such as a rotating blade.
