Optical Ampliﬁer
Many ﬁber links are loss limited. One cause is the limited power available from the typical laser diode, which
(together with the losses in the ﬁber and the other system components) restricts the length of ﬁber that can be
used. The ﬁber optic ampliﬁer increases the power level of the signal beam without conversion to the electrical
domain. For example, gains of 30 dB are attainable at 1550 nm using the erbium-doped ﬁber ampliﬁer (EDFA).
Quite importantly, the EDFA has a bandwidth of over 20 nm so that several WDM or numerous OFDM channels
(described later in this section) can be ampliﬁed simultaneously.
