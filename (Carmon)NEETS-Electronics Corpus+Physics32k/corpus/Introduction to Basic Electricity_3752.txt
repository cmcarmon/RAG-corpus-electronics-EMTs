To protect circuits against excessive transient volt-
age, a varistor is used. A varistor is an electronic 
component; the most common type is a metal-oxide 
varistor (moV). A MOV protects various types of 
electronic devices and semiconductor elements from 
switching and induced lightning surges. When ex-
posed to high transient voltage, the MOV clamps the 
voltage to a safe level. An MOV absorbs potentially 
destructive energy and dissipates it as heat, protecting 
the circuit components.
