depends mainly on three things: (1) the number of conductors in series per winding, (2) the speed
(alternator rpm) at which the magnetic field cuts the winding, and (3) the strength of the magnetic field.
Any of these three factors could be used to control the amount of voltage induced in the alternator
windings.
