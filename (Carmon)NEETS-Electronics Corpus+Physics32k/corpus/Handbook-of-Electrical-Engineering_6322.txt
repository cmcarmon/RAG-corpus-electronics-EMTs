In the United States, the FCC has ruled (in March 1990) that any new HDTV system must permit continuation
of service to contemporary NTSC receivers. This signiﬁcant constraint applies to terrestrial broadcasting (as
opposed to videodisk, videotape, and cable television). The HDTV signals will be sent on “taboo channels,”
those  that  are  not  used  in  metropolitan  areas  to  provide  adequate  separation.  Thus,  these  currently  unused
channels  would  be  used  for  simulcast  signals.  Since  the  proposed  HDTV  system  for  the  United  States  uses
digital transmission, transmitter power can be less than that used for conventional television — this reduces
interference with adjacent channels. Indeed, in heavily populated urban areas (where many stations are licensed
for broadcast), the HDTV signals will have to be severely limited in power.
