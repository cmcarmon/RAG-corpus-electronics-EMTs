Acoustic Data Fusion
Acoustic data fusion is a technique that combines information from multiple receivers or receiving platforms
about a common object or channel. Instead of each receiver making a decision, relevant information from the
different receivers is sent to a common control unit where the acoustic data is combined and processed (hence
the  name  data  fusion). After  fusion,  a  decision  can  be  relayed  or “fed”  back  to  each  of  the  receivers.  If  data
transmission  is  a  concern,  due  to  time  constraints,  cost,  or  security,  other  techniques  can  be  used  in  which
each receiver makes a decision and transmits only the decision. The control unit makes a global decision based
on the decisions of all the receivers and relays this global decision back to the receivers. This is called “distributed
detection.” The receivers can then be asked to re-evaluate their individual decisions based on the new global
decision. This process could continue until all the receivers are in agreement or could be terminated whenever
an acceptable level of consensus is attained.
