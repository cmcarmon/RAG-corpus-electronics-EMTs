The communication link between the monitoring point and the control center can now be very sophisticated
and can utilize satellites. This technology has led to the development of systems to analyze the power quality
of  a  system.  Harmonic  measurement  and  analysis  has  now  reached  a  high  level  of  maturity.  Many  different
pieces of information can be monitored and the results over time stored in a database. Algorithms based on
the fast Fourier transform can then be used to convert this data from the time domain to the frequency domain.
Computing techniques coupled with fast and often parallel computing allows this information to be displayed
in  real  time.  By  utilizing  the  time  stamping  capability  of  the  global  positioning  system  (GPS),  information
gathered at remote sites can be linked together. Using the GPS time stamp, samples taken exactly simultaneously
can be feed to a harmonic state estimator which can even determine the position and magnitude of harmonics
entering the system as well as the harmonic voltages and currents at points not monitored (provided enough
initial monitoring points exist).
