Transverse acceleration (perpendicular to velocity) causes change in direction. If it is constant in magnitude and changing in direction with the velocity, we get a circular motion. For this centripetal acceleration we have




a

v

r



=


ω

2




r



{\displaystyle a\,={\frac {v^{2}}{r}}\,={\omega ^{2}}{r}}

where:




v



{\displaystyle v\,}
is orbital velocity of orbiting body,




r



{\displaystyle r\,}
is radius of the circle




ω



{\displaystyle \omega \ }
is angular speed, measured in radians per unit time.
The formula is dimensionless, describing a ratio true for all units of measure applied uniformly across the formula. If the numerical value of




a



{\displaystyle \mathbf {a} }
is measured in meters per second per second, then the numerical values for



v



{\displaystyle v\,}
will be in meters per second,



r



{\displaystyle r\,}
in meters, and



ω



{\displaystyle \omega \ }
in radians per second.
