Dr. James E. Faller is an American physicist and inventor who specializes in the field of Gravity. He conceived the Lunar Laser Ranging Program, that shoots high powered laser beams at special retroreflectors placed on the Moon by Apollo program Astronauts. He invented a Gravity Motion Sensor, called the Absolute Gravimeter that is so sensitive to mass, that it can detect a person walking around it, by his mass. His work has been featured in many books and magazines like National Geographic. In 2001 his Gravity Detector device was featured on the Science Channel on Head Rush and was used to debunk Anti-gravity devices that were for sale on the market. All devices they tested did not produce Gravity or Anti-Gravity. His research interests include geophysics, experimental relativity, fundamental constants, and precision measurement experiments designed to look for possible invalidations of accepted physical laws at some extreme of magnitude. He is currently working on a new measurement of G, the Newtonian constant of gravitation. He currently works for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
