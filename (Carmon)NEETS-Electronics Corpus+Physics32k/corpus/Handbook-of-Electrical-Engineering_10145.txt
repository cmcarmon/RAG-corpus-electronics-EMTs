So far we have considered the control of one joint of the robot while the other joints are ﬁxed. Implementation
of this control by successively positioning each joint while the other joints are ﬁxed slows the robot operation
and can also result in awkward hand motions, which is undesirable especially when the robot is supposed to
follow a continuous path. Simultaneous fast motion of the joints, on the other hand, requires the inclusion of
dynamic interactions between the joints. The controllers designed without considering these dynamic interac-
tions tend to make the arm move slower and can potentially cause overshoots, oscillations, and path errors. To
estimate  the  dynamic  effects,  one  needs  to  obtain  the  equations  of  motion  (dynamic  models)  of  the  robot.
These equations are, in general, complex and take the form of coupled nonlinear differential equations.
