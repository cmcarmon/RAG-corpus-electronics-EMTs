The increased use of crimp-on terminals is due to the limitations of soldered terminals. The quality 
of soldered connections depends mostly upon the operator's skill. Other factors, such as temperature, flux, 
cleanliness, oxides, and insulation damage due to heat, also add to defective connections. Solder-type 
connections are covered later in this chapter.
