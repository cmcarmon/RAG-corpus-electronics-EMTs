The radar antenna in figure 3-16 uses a feed section to drive horizontally stacked array sections 
which radiate the applied rf pulses. The same array sections receive the target returns. Each array contains 
slots cut to radiate and receive a particular frequency. Bearing data is obtained by mechanically rotating 
the antenna 360 degrees. Elevation data is obtained by electronic scanning of the beam in elevation. The 
radar antenna is frequency sensitive and radiates pulses at an elevation angle determined by the applied 
frequency. When the frequency is increased, the beam elevation angle decreases. Conversely, when the 
applied frequency is decreased, the beam elevation angle increases. The beam elevation angle is therefore 
selected by the application of a frequency corresponding to the desired angle of elevation. The physical 
length of the antenna feed section, called the SERPENTINE SECTION (figure 3-17), in relation to the 
wavelength of the applied energy determines the direction of the radiated beam. You may understand this 
more clearly if you consider how the beam is shifted. The shift occurs with a change in frequency because 
the positive and negative peaks of the energy arrive at adjacent slotted arrays at different times. The 
change in the field pattern is such that the angle of departure (angle at which the radiated beam leaves the 
antenna) of the beam is changed. Note that a change in phase of the applied rf energy would cause the 
same effect.
