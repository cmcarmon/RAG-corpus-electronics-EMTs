The video amplifier receives pulses from the detector and amplifies these pulses for application to
the indicating device. A video amplifier is fundamentally an RC coupled amplifier that uses high-gain
transistors or pentodes. However, a video amplifier must be capable of a relatively wide frequency
response. Stray and interelectrode capacitances reduce the high-frequency response of an amplifier, and
the reactance of the coupling capacitor diminishes the low-frequency response. These problems are
overcome by the use of FREQUENCY COMPENSATION NETWORKS in the video amplifier. The
types of frequency compensation networks that may be used in a video amplifier stage are discussed in
detail in NEETS, Module 8, Introduction to Amplifiers.
