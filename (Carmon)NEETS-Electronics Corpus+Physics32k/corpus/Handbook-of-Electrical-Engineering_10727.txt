Key features include: the use of dynamic orbit estimation, which depends on high-accuracy satellite
force models, signal models, geophysical models, and geometric models, in a Kalman ﬁlter formulation;
use  of  real-time  stochastic  estimation  to  minimize  orbit  and  clock  errors  arising  from  quasi-random
variations  in  atmospheric  propagation  relays  and  solar  radiation  pressure;  simultaneous  processing  of
smoothed pseudorange and continuous carrier phase data; and use of the stable solar-magnetic reference
frame, rather than an Earth-ﬁxed frame, in computing the ionosphere corrections.
