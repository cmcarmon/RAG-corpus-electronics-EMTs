Figure 5-10 (method A) illustrates a far-field angular scan of the fiber-end face by a rotating
detector. The fiber output radiation pattern is scanned by a rotating detector in the far-field. The detector
rotates in a spherical manner. A record of the far-field power distribution is kept as a function of angle Ã¿.
