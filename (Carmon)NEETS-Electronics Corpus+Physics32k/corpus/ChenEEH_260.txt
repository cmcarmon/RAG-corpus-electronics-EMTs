design. On the other hand, in this kind of system, the transient
of the load-end converter will have less effect on the bus
voltage and thus less effect on the other load-end converters.
As a result, for future applications, the high-input-voltage
VRMs’ input ﬁlter size can be dramatically reduced. Figure
1.23 shows the results. When the bus voltage increases from
5 V to 48 V, the VRM input ﬁlter capacitance can be reduced
from 10 mF to 10 mF.
