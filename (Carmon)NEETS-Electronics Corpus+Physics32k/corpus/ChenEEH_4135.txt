signal-to-noise ratio. GSM designers use a BT of 0.3 with a
channel data rate of 270.8 kbps. DECT designers adopt
BT ¼ 0:5 with a data rate of 1.152 Mbs. A choice of
BT ¼ 0:3 in GSM is a compromise between bit error rate
and out-of-band interference since the narrow ﬁlter increases
the intersymbol interference and reduces the signal power.
