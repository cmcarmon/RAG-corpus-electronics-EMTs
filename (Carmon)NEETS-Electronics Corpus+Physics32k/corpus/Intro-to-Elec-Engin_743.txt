ac while isolating them for dc are limited in their low-frequency response. The high-frequency
deterioration of the voltage gain is due to the effect of capacitances that are internal to the transistor.
Figure 8.5.1 shows a typical frequency response of a voltage ampliﬁer. While most often the
magnitude of the gain is discussed (because it deﬁnes the frequency range of useful gain), the
phase response becomes important for transient calculations. The midband region is the range of
frequencies where gain is nearly constant. Ampliﬁers are normally considered to operate in this
useful midband region. The bandwidth of an ampliﬁer is customarily deﬁned as the band between
two frequencies, denoted by ωH and ωL, which corresponds to the gain falling to 3 dB below the
midband constant gain. Thus,
