The system of six coupled partial differential equations of (9.9)
and (9.10) forms the basis of the FDTD numerical algorithm
for electromagnetic wave interactions with general
three-
dimensional objects. The FDTD algorithm need not explicitly
enforce the Gauss’s law relations indicating zero free electric
and magnetic charge shown in equations 9.3 and 9.4. This is
because these relations are theoretically a direct consequence of
the curl equations, as can be readily shown. However, the
FDTD space grid must be structured so that the Gauss’s law
relations are implicit in the positions of the E- and H-ﬁeld
vector components in the grid and in the numerical space-
derivative operations upon these components that model the
action of the curl operator. This will be discussed later in the
context of the Yee mesh.
