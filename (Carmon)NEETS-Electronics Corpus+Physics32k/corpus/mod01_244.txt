Carbon resistors, as you might suspect, have as their principal ingredient the element carbon. In the
manufacturer of carbon resistors, fillers or binders are added to the carbon to obtain various resistor
values. Examples of these fillers are clay, bakelite, rubber, and talc. These fillers are doping agents and
cause the overall conduction characteristics to change.
