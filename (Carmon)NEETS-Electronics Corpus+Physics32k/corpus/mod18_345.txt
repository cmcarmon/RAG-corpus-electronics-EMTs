Were it not for noise, the maximum range at which an object would be detectable by radar could be
extended almost infinitely. Objects at great range return exceedingly small echoes. However, without
noise, almost any signal could be amplified to a usable level if enough stages were added to the receiver.
Because of noise, the signal detection limit or sensitivity level of a receiver is reached when the signal
level falls below the noise level to such an extent as to be obscured. A simple increase of amplification is
of no help because both signal and noise are amplified at the same rate.
