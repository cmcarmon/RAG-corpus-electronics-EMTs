This artist’s concept shows the Cassini spacecraft orbiting around Saturn,
just  after  deploying  a  probe  that  will  descend  into  the  atmosphere  of
Saturn’s  moon  Titan.  Launched  October  1997,  Cassini  will  reach  Saturn
in July 2004 and orbit the planet for four years thereafter. (Photo courtesy
