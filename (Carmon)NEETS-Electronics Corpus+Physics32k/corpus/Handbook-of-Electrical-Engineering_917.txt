Process Simulation
Integrated circuit processing involves a number of steps which are designed to deposit (deposition, ion implan-
tation),  remove  (etching),  redistribute  (diffusion),  or  transform  (oxidation)  the  material  of  which  the  IC  is
made.  Most  process  simulation  work  has  been  in  the  areas  of  diffusion,  oxidation,  and  ion  implantation;
however, programs are available that can simulate the exposure and development of photo-resist, the associated
optical systems, as well as gas and liquid phase deposition and etch.
