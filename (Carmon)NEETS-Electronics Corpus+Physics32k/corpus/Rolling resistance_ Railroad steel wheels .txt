In order to apply any traction to the wheels, some slippage of the wheel is required. For Russian trains climbing up a grade, this slip is normally 1.5% to 2.5%.
Slip (also known as creep) is normally roughly directly proportional to tractive effort. An exception is if the tractive effort is so high that the wheel is close to substantial slipping (more than just a few percent as discussed above), then slip rapidly increases with tractive effort and is no longer linear. With a little higher applied tractive effort the wheel spins out of control and the adhesion drops resulting in the wheel spinning even faster. This is the type of slipping that is observable by eyeâ€”the slip of say 2% for traction is only observed by instruments. Such rapid slip may result in excessive wear or damage.
