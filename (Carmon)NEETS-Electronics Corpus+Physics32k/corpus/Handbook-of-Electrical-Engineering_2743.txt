FIGURE 25.25 Circuit stages of design. (a) Initial speciÔ¨Åcation (e.g., HDL, schematic, etc.) of ASIC function in terms of
functions, with the next lower level description of function C illustrated. (b) Estimated size of physical blocks implementing
functions. (c) Floorplanning to organize blocks on an IC. (d) Placement and routing of interconnections among blocks.
