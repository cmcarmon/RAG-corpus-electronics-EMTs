1. Include a wide-long device; without this, the results will not be physically correct.
2. All MOS transistors with the same width should be drawn with their sources and drains identical. No
difference should be seen in the number of source/drain contacts, contact spacing, source/drain contact
overlap, poly gate to contact spacing, etc.
