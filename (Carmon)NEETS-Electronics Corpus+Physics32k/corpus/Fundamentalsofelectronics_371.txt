• The integral of a sinusoid over an integer number of periods equals zero.
• The integral of the square of a unit-amplitude sinusoid over a period T equals T /2.
To use these, let’s, for example, multiply the Fourier series for a signal by the cosine of the lth harmonic
and integrate. The idea is that, because integration is linear, the integration will sift out all but
