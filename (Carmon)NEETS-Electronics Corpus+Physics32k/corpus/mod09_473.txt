Increasing the value of R3 or C1 increases the time constant. The capacitor will not charge to as high 
a voltage in the same period of time. Decreasing the width of the gate and maintaining the same time 
constant also prevents the capacitor from charging as much. With less charge on the capacitor, and the 
same voltage applied, linearity has been improved. Decreasing R3 or C1 or increasing gate width 
decreases linearity. Changing the applied voltage will change the charge on the capacitor. The percentage 
of charge remains constant; however, it does not affect linearity.
