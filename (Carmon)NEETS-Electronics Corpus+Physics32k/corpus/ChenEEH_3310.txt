An outline of the Gauss-Seidel algorithm for solving the
power ﬂow equations of 7.42 is presented next. Let us start
with an initial condition for the bus voltages V 0
bus, and we
would like to compute the iterate V kþ1
from the previous
iterate V k
bus. Recall that bus 1 is a slack bus and, hence,
1 ¼ 1ﬀ0 for all iterations. Also, busses 2 through NG þ 1
V k
are PV busses; therefore we need to keep V k
i at speciﬁed values
Vi, specified ¼ V 0
