If the Earth is assumed to be a featureless sphere (rather than an oblate spheroid) with no atmospheric refraction, then the distance to the horizon can easily be calculated.
The secant-tangent theorem states that

O

.


{\displaystyle \mathrm {OC} ^{2}=\mathrm {OA} \times \mathrm {OB} \,.}

Make the following substitutions:
d = OC = distance to the horizon
D = AB = diameter of the Earth
h = OB = height of the observer above sea level
D+h = OA = diameter of the Earth plus height of the observer above sea level
The formula now becomes





d

=
h
(
D

h
)




{\displaystyle d^{2}=h(D+h)\,\!}

or




d
=

(

R
+
h
)



,


{\displaystyle d={\sqrt {h(D+h)}}={\sqrt {h(2R+h)}}\,,}

where R is the radius of the Earth.
The equation can also be derived using the Pythagorean theorem. Since the line of sight is a tangent to the Earth, it is perpendicular to the radius at the horizon. This sets up a right triangle, with the sum of the radius and the height as the hypotenuse. With
d = distance to the horizon
h = height of the observer above sea level
R = radius of the Earth
referring to the second figure at the right leads to the following:

{\displaystyle d={\sqrt {h(2R+h)}}\,.}

Another relationship involves the distance s along the curved surface of the Earth to the horizon; with γ in radians,




s
=
R
γ

;


{\displaystyle s=R\gamma \,;}

then

{\displaystyle \cos \gamma =\cos {\frac {s}{R}}={\frac {R}{R+h}}\,.}

Solving for s gives

{\displaystyle s=R\cos ^{-1}{\frac {R}{R+h}}\,.}

The distance s can also be expressed in terms of the line-of-sight distance d; from the second figure at the right,

{\displaystyle \tan \gamma ={\frac {d}{R}}\,;}

substituting for γ and rearranging gives

{\displaystyle s=R\tan ^{-1}{\frac {d}{R}}\,.}

The distances d and s are nearly the same when the height of the object is negligible compared to the radius (that is, h ≪ R).
