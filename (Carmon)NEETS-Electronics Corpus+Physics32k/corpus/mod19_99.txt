Shock is a condition in which blood circulation is seriously disturbed. Crushed or fractured bones, 
burns, prolonged bleeding, and asphyxia all cause shock. It may be slight or it may be severe enough to 
cause death. Because all injuries will result in some form of shock, you must learn its symptoms and 
know how to treat the victim.
