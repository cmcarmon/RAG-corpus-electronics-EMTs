where Z0 is the characteristic impedance of a two-wire trans-
mission line having the same wire diameter as that of the
folded dipole and having a line-to-line separation d. In con-
trast, the even mode represents an antenna mode of operation
with I Â¼ 0 at the top and bottom ends to satisfy the symmetry
condition. The antenna mode operates very much as two
dipole antennas of length L that are placed close to each
other. The current distribution along the wire is the same as
that for an equivalent dipole antenna and, therefore, has the
same radiation pattern and gain. The input current Ia for
the antenna mode can be related to the input voltage Vin
using the input impedance Zdipole of an equivalent dipole
antenna of length L:
