JPEG 2000 is suitable for a wide range of images, from those produced by portable digital cameras to advanced prepress and medical
imaging. JPEG 2000 is a new image coding system that uses state-of-the-art compression techniques based on wavelet technology
that stores its information in a data stream instead of blocks as in JPEG. This is a scalable lossy compression scheme.
