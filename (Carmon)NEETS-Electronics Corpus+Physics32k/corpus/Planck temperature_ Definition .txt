{\displaystyle T_{\text{P}}={\frac {m_{\text{P}}c^{2}}{k}}={\sqrt {\frac {\hbar c^{5}}{Gk^{2}}}}\approx }
1.416808(33) × 1032 K where:
mP is the Planck mass,
c is speed of light in a vacuum,




ℏ


{\displaystyle \hbar }
is the reduced Planck constant defined as

,


{\displaystyle \hbar \ ={\frac {h}{2\pi }},}

k is the Boltzmann constant,
G is the gravitational constant.
The two digits between the parentheses are used to denote the standard error of the last two digits of the estimated value.
