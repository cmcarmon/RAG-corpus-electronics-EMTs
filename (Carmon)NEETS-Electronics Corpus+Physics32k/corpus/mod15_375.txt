output axis that will cause the inner gimbal to exert torque against the torsion bars. The torsion bars 
provide a restraining torque proportional to the amount of the inner gimbal's displacement. When the 
exerted gimbal torque is exactly opposed by the restraining torque provided by the torsion bars, the inner 
gimbal displacement will be proportional to the rate of rotation of the gyro case about the input axis. The 
pickoff measures this displacement and provides a signal whose amplitude and polarity (or phase) 
represent the direction and magnitude of the input angular velocity.
