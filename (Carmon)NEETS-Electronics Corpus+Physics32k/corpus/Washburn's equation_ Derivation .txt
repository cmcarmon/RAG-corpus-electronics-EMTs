{\displaystyle L^{2}={\frac {\gamma Dt\cos(\phi )}{4\eta }}}

where



t


{\displaystyle t}
is the time for a liquid of dynamic viscosity



η


{\displaystyle \eta }
and surface tension



γ


{\displaystyle \gamma }
to penetrate a distance



L


{\displaystyle L}
into the capillary whose pore diameter is



D


{\displaystyle D}
. The contact angle between liquid and solid is



ϕ


{\displaystyle \phi }
. In case of a porous materials many issues have been raised both about the physical meaning of the calculated pore diameter



D


{\displaystyle D}
and the real possibility to use this equation for the calculation of the contact angle of the solid. The equation is derived for capillary flow in a cylindrical tube in the absence of a gravitational field, but is sufficiently accurate in many cases when the capillary force is still significantly greater than the gravitational force.
In his paper from 1921 Washburn applies Poiseuille's Law for fluid motion in a circular tube. Inserting the expression for the differential volume in terms of the length

η

is the coefficient of slip, which is assumed to be 0 for wetting materials.
