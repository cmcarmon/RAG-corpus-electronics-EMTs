The intersection point is marked (y) in Figure 7.40. Recall that the current iDS
and the output voltage vO (which, in our amplifier circuit, is the same as vDS)
is constrained to the load line by KVL. Substituting for iDS from Equation 7.39
into 7.40, rearranging terms, and multiplying out by RL, we get
