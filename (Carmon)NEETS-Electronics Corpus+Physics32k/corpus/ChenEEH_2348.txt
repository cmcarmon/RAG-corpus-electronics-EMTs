By assigning different pairs of values for m and n, the lowest
four values of fc=[fc]TE1;0 can be computed for different ratios
of a/b as reported in Figure 5.4.
From Figure 5.4 the second lowest cutoff frequency, for
b=a  1=2, which corresponds to that of the TE2;0 mode, is
twice the cutoff frequency of the dominant mode TE1;0. For
this reason, the dimension b of a rectangular waveguide is
generally chosen to be less than or equal to a=2 to achieve a
single-mode transmission over a complete octave (factor 2:1)
range of frequencies.
