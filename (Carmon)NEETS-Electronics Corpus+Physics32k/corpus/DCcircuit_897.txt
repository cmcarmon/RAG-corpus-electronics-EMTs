An unfortunate design constraint of pH electrodes is that one of them (called the measure-
ment electrode) must be constructed of special glass to create the ion-selective barrier needed
to screen out hydrogen ions from all the other ions ﬂoating around in the solution. This glass is
chemically doped with lithium ions, which is what makes it react electrochemically to hydrogen
ions. Of course, glass is not exactly what you would call a ”conductor;” rather, it is an extremely
good insulator. This presents a major problem if our intent is to measure voltage between the
two electrodes. The circuit path from one electrode contact, through the glass barrier, through
the solution, to the other electrode, and back through the other electrode’s contact, is one of
extremely high resistance.
