Hot-wire and thermocouple meter movements both use the heating effect of current flowing through
a resistance to cause meter deflection. Each uses this effect in a different manner. Since their operation
depends only on the heating effect of current flow, they may be used to measure both direct current and
alternating current of any frequency on a single scale.
