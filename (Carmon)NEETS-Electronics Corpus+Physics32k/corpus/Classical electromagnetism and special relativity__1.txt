The above transformation rules show that the electric field in one frame contributes to the magnetic field in another frame, and vice versa. This is often described by saying that the electric field and magnetic field are two interrelated aspects of a single object, called the electromagnetic field. Indeed, the entire electromagnetic field can be encoded in a single rank-2 tensor called the electromagnetic tensor; see below.
