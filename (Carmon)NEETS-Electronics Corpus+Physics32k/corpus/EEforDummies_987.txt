Some circuits (for instance, some op‐amp circuits, 
which are discussed in Chapter 11) require both 
positive and negative DC power supplies. You’ll 
often see the positive supply represented by an 
open circle labeled +V and the negative supply 
represented by an open circle labeled –V. If the 
voltages are not specified, they may be +5 VDC 
and –5 VDC. Figure 14-6 shows how these power 
supply connection points are really implemented.
