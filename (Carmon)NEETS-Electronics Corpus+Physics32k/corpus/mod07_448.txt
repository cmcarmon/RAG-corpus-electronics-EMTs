Notice in figure 4-19 that this filter consists of an input inductor (L1), or filter choke, and an output 
filter capacitor (C1). Inductor L1 is placed at the input to the filter and is in series with the output of the 
rectifier circuit. Since the action of an inductor is to oppose any change in current flow, the inductor tends 
to keep a constant current flowing to the load throughout the complete cycle of the applied voltage. As a 
result, the output voltage never reaches the peak value of the applied voltage. Instead, the output voltage 
approximates the average value of the rectified input to the filter, as shown in the figure. The reactance of 
the inductor (XL) reduces the amplitude of ripple voltage without reducing the dc output voltage by an 
appreciable amount. (The dc resistance of the inductor is just a few ohms.)
