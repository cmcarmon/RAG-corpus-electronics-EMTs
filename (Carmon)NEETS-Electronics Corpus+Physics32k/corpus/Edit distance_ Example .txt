The Levenshtein distance between "kitten" and "sitting" is 3. A minimal edit script that transforms the former into the latter is:
kitten → sitten (substitution of "s" for "k")
sitten → sittin (substitution of "i" for "e")
sittin → sitting (insertion of "g" at the end).
LCS distance (insertions and deletions only) gives a different distance and minimal edit script:
delete k at 0
insert s at 0
delete e at 4
insert i at 4
insert g at 6
for a total cost/distance of 5 operations.
