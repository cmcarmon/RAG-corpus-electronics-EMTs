To calculate the full diffraction image that is visible on the screen one has to consider the surface integral of the previous section. One cannot exploit circular symmetry anymore, since the line between the source and an arbitrary point on the screen does not pass through the center of the circular object. With the aperture function



g
(
r
,
θ
)


{\displaystyle g(r,\theta )}
which is 1 for transparent parts of the object plane and 0 otherwise (i.e. It is 0 if the direct line between source and the point on the screen passes through the blocking circular object.) the integral that needs to be solved is given by:

{\displaystyle U(P_{1})\propto \int _{0}^{2\pi }\int _{0}^{\infty }g(r,\theta )e^{{\frac {\mathbf {i} \pi \rho ^{2}}{\lambda }}\left({\frac {1}{g}}+{\frac {1}{b}}\right)}\rho \,d\rho \,d\theta .}

Numerical calculation of the integral using the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule is not efficient and becomes numerically unstable especially for configurations with large Fresnel number. However, it is possible to solve the radial part of the integral so that only the integration over the azimuth angle remains to be done numerically. For a particular angle one must solve the line integral for the ray with origin at the intersection point of the line P0P1 with the circular object plane. The contribution for a particular ray with azimuth angle

{\displaystyle R(\theta _{1})\propto e^{\pi \mathbf {i} s^{2}/2}-e^{\pi \mathbf {i} t^{2}/2}.}

So for each angle one has to compute the intersection point(s) of the ray with the circular object and then sum the contributions

. Results of such a calculation are shown in the following images.

The images show simulated Arago spots in the shadow of a disc of varying diameter (4 mm, 2 mm, 1 mm – left to right) at a distance of 1 m from the disc. The point source has a wavelength of 633 nm (e.g. He-Ne Laser) and is located 1 m from the disc. The image width corresponds to 16 mm.
