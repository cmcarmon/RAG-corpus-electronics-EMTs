As noted previously, substrate (typically PCB) design has an effect not only on board/component layout, but
also on the actual manufacturing process. Incorrect land design or layout can negatively affect the placement
process, the solder process, the test process or any combination of the three. Substrate design must take into
account the mix of SMDs that are available for use in manufacturing.
