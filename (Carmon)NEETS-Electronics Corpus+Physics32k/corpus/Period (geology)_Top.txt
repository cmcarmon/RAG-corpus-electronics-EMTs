A geologic period is one of several subdivisions of geologic time enabling cross-referencing of rocks and geologic events from place to place.
These periods form elements of a hierarchy of divisions into which geologists have split the Earth's history.
Eons and eras are larger subdivisions than periods while periods themselves may be divided into epochs and ages.
The rocks formed during a period belong to a stratigraphic unit called a system.
