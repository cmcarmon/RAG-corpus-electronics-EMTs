In many cases, a processor requires one or more large external
memories, mostly of the (S)DRAM type, to store long-term
data. For data-dominated applications, the total system power
cost in the past was for the most part attributed to the presence of
these external memories on the board. Because of the heavy push
toward lower power solutions to keep the package costs low, and
also for mobile applications or due to reliability issues, the power
consumption of such external DRAMs has been reduced signiÔ¨Å-
cantly. This has also been a very active research topic.
