IDD is not used instead of other incremental models, but rather as an enhancement that will make those models more efficient. One obstacle when using IDD is to create the integration plan â€“ the definition of what to develop and integrate at a given time. One way that has proven successful is to use System Anatomies for original planning and Integration Anatomies for re-planning and follow-up. Since all planning will require time and resources IDD may be considered unnecessary for development with low complexity of the system and organization (i.e., small teams developing small systems).
