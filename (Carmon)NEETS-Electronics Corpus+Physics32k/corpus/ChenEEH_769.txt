In the past, techniques for estimating memory reuse have
been proposed (Cierniak and Li, 1995; Eisenbeis et al., 1991;
Wilde and Rajopadhye, 1996). These techniques however have
provided only a memory reuse model and not a (complete)
strategy for actually reusing memory space inside an array as
well as between different arrays. This is due to the lack of exact
mathematical model(s) of memory usage. In contrast, we have
presented exact mathematical models for memory usage in
examples presented by Catthoor et al. (1998), which allows
us to perform more aggressive optimizations.
