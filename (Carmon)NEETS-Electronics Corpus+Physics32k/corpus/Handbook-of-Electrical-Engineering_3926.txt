While the bandwidth of the basic element is limited, considerable research and development during the last
15  years  has  led  to  a  number  of  creative  and  novel  techniques  for  the  enhancement  of  microstrip  antenna
bandwidth,  so  that  impedance  bandwidths  ranging  from  10  to  40%  can  now  be  achieved  [James  and  Hall,
1989; Pozar and Schaubert, 1995]. While there have been dozens of proposed techniques for the enhancement
of microstrip antenna bandwidth, they can all be categorized according to three canonical approaches:
