Explosive astrophysical environments often have very large fluxes of high energy nucleons that can be captured on seed nuclei. In these environments, radiative neutron capture, whether of protons or neutrons, will be much faster than are beta-decays, and as astrophysical environments with both large neutron fluxes and high energy protons are unknown at present, the reaction flow will proceed away from beta-stability towards or up to either the neutron or proton drip lines, respectively. However, once a nucleus reaches a drip line, as we have seen, no more nucleons of that species can be added to the particular nucleus, and the nucleus must first undergo a beta-decay before further nucleon captures can occur.
