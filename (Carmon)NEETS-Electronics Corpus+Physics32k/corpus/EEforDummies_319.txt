One of the most important concepts to understand in 
electronics is the relationship between voltage, cur-
rent, and resistance in a circuit, summarized in a 
simple equation known as Ohm’s Law. When you 
understand this equation thoroughly, you’ll be well 
on your way to analyzing circuits that other people 
have designed, as well as successfully designing 
your own circuits. Before diving into Ohm’s Law, it 
may help to take a quick look at the ebbs and flows 
of current.
