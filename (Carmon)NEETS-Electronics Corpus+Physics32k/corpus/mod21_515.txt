Before the frequency of a signal can be measured on a spectrum analyzer, it must be RESOLVED. 
Resolving a signal means distinguishing it from other signals near it. Resolution is limited by the 
narrowest bandwidth of the spectrum analyzer because the analyzer traces out its own IF bandwidth shape 
as it sweeps through a signal. If the narrowest bandwidth is 1 kilohertz, the nearest any two signals can 
be, and still be resolved, is 1 kilohertz. Reducing the IF bandwidth indefinitely would obtain infinite 
resolution except that the usable IF bandwidth is limited by the stability of the spectrum analyzer. The 
smaller the IF bandwidth, the greater the capability of the analyzer to resolve closely spaced signals of 
unequal amplitudes. Modern spectrum analyzers have been refined to the degree that IF bandwidths are 
less than 1 hertz.
