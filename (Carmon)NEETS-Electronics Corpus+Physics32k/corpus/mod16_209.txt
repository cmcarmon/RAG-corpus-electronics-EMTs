For a +10 dBm level, start with the 1 milliwatt reference and move the decimal point one place to the
right (+10 dBm = 10 mW). Another 10 dB increment brings the power level to +20 dBm, thereby moving
the decimal point another place to the right (+20 dBm = 100 mW). For a - 10 dBm level, again start with
1 milliwatt, but this time move the decimal point one place to the left ( - 10 dBm = .1 mW). An additional
10 dB decrease results in another decimal point shift to the left ( - 20 dBm = .01 mW).
