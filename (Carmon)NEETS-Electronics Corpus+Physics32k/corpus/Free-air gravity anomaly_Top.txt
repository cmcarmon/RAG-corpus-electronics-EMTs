In geophysics, the free-air gravity anomaly, often simply called the free-air anomaly, is the measured gravity anomaly after a free-air correction is applied to correct for the elevation at which a measurement is made. The free-air correction does so by adjusting these measurements of gravity to what would have been measured at a reference level. For Earth, this reference level is commonly taken as the mean sea level.
