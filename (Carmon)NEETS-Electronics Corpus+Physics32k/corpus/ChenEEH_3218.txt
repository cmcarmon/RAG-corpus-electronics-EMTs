The advantages of the double bus–single breaker scheme
include (a) some ﬂexibility with two operating busses, (b) the
ability of either main bus to be isolated for maintenance and
(c) transferring the circuit readily from one bus to the other by
using bus-tie breaker and bus selector disconnect switches.
Disadvantages include (a) one extra breaker required for the
bus tie, (b) four switches required per circuit, (c) a bus protec-
tion scheme that may cause loss of substation when it operates
if all circuits are connected to that bus, (d) high exposure to
bus faults, (e) line breaker failure taking all circuits connected
to that bus out of service, and (f) bus-tie breaker failure taking
the entire substation out of service.
