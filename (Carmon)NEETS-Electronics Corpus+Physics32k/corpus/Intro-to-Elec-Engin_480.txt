The general-purpose digital computer is the best known example of a digital system. Other
examples include teletypewriters, word processors, dial-telephone switching exchanges, fre-
quency counters, remote controls, and other peripheral equipment. Manipulation of ﬁnite, discrete
elements of information is a characteristic of a digital system. Information in digital systems is
represented by signals (currents or voltages) that take on a limited number of discrete values and
are processed by devices that normally function only in a limited number of discrete states. A
great majority of present digital devices are binary (i.e., have signals and states limited to two
values) because of the lack of practical devices capable of performing reliably in more than two
discrete states. Transistor circuitry, which can be constructed with extreme reliability, has two
possible signal values, either on state or off state. With the advent of transistors, the computer
industry ﬂourished.
