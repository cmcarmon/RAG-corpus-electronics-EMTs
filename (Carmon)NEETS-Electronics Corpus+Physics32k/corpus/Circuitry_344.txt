The frequency response of an amplifier is usually 
specified  in  terms  of  the  upper  and  lower  cut-off 
frequencies of the amplifier. These frequencies are 
those  at  which  the  output  power  has  dropped  to 
50%  (otherwise  known  as  the  *3dB  points) or 
where the voltage gain has dropped to 70.7% of its 
mid-band value.  
  Figures  7.10  and  7.11,  respectively,  show  how 
the bandwidth can be expressed in terms of either 
power or voltage (the cut-off frequencies, f1 and f2,
and bandwidth are identical).
