C series connectors are weatherproof, quick-connect/disconnect, bayonet-locking type connectors. 
They are used with medium size cables, such as RG-5/U, RG-8/U, and RG-9/U. They operate up to a 
peak of 1,000 volts and at frequencies up to 10 gigahertz. Their impedance is 50 ohms. Figure 1-31 shows 
three typical C series connectors. Figure 1-32 shows you how to attach the C series connectors to a 
coaxial cable.
