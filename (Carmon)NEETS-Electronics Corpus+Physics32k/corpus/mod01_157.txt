The shape of the magnet most frequently used in electrical and electronic equipment is called the
horseshoe magnet. A horseshoe magnet is similar to a bar magnet but is bent in the shape of a horseshoe.
The horseshoe magnet provides much more magnetic strength than a bar magnet of the same size and
material because of the closeness of the magnetic poles. The magnetic strength from one pole to the other
is greatly increased due to the concentration of the magnetic field in a smaller area. Electrical measuring
devices quite frequently use horseshoe-type magnets.
