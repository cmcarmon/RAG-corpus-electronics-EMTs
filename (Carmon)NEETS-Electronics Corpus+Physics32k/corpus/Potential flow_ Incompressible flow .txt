In case of an incompressible flow — for instance of a liquid, or a gas at low Mach numbers; but not for sound waves — the velocity v has zero divergence:




∇
⋅

v

=
0

,


{\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf {v} =0\,,}

with the dot denoting the inner product. As a result, the velocity potential φ has to satisfy Laplace's equation





∇

2


φ
=
0

,


{\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}\varphi =0\,,}

where ∇2 = ∇ ⋅ ∇ is the Laplace operator (sometimes also written Δ). In this case the flow can be determined completely from its kinematics: the assumptions of irrotationality and zero divergence of flow. Dynamics only have to be applied afterwards, if one is interested in computing pressures: for instance for flow around airfoils through the use of Bernoulli's principle.
In two dimensions, potential flow reduces to a very simple system that is analyzed using complex analysis (see below).
