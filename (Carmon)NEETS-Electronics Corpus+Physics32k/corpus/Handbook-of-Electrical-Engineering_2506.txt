Unfortunately, hFE is an ill-deﬁned quantity and varies not only from transistor to transistor but also changes
with  temperature.  The  relationship  between  the  base-emitter  voltage VBE  and  the  collector  current  is  much
better deﬁned and follows an exponential law closely over at least eight decades. This relationship is shown in
both  linear  and  logarithmic  form  in  Fig.  24.26.  Because  the  output  current  IC  is  dependent  upon  the  input
voltage VBE , the plot must be a transfer conductance or transconductance characteristic. The relevant law is
