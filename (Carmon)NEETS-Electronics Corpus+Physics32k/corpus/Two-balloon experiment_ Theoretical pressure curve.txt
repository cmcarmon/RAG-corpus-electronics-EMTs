The key to understanding the behavior of the balloons is understanding how the pressure inside a balloon varies with the balloon's diameter. The simplest way to do this is to imagine that the balloon is made up of a large number of small rubber patches, and to analyze how the size of a patch is affected by the force acting on it.
The James-Guth stress-strain relation  for a parallelepiped of ideal rubber can be written

{\displaystyle f_{i}={1 \over L_{i}}\left[kKT\left({L_{i} \over L_{i}^{0}}\right)^{2}-pV\right].}

Here, fi is the externally applied force in the i'th direction, Li is a linear dimension, k is Boltzmann's constant, K is a constant related to the number of possible network configurations of the sample, T is the absolute temperature, Li0 is an unstretched dimension, p is the internal (hydrostatic) pressure, and V is the volume of the sample. Thus, the force consists of two parts: the first one (caused by the polymer network) gives a tendency to contract, while the second gives a tendency to expand.
Suppose that the balloon is composed of many such interconnected patches, which deform in a similar way as the balloon expands. Because rubber strongly resists volume changes, the volume V can be considered constant. This allows the stress-strain relation to be written

{\displaystyle f_{i}=\left(C_{1}/L_{i}\right)\left(\lambda _{i}^{2}-C_{2}p\right)}

where λi=Li/Li0 is the relative extension. In the case of a thin-walled spherical shell, all the force which acts to stretch the rubber is directed tangentially to the surface. The radial force (i.e., the force acting to compress the shell wall) can therefore be set equal to zero, so that

{\displaystyle \lambda _{r}^{2}=(t/t_{0})^{2}=C_{2}p}

where t0 and t refer to the initial and final thicknesses, respectively. For a balloon of radius



r


{\displaystyle r}
, a fixed volume of rubber means that r2t is constant, or equivalently

{\displaystyle t\propto {\frac {1}{r^{2}}}}

hence

where r0 is the balloon's uninflated radius.

and drops to zero as r increases. This behavior is well known to anyone who has blown up a balloon: a large force is required at the start, but after the balloon expands (to a radius larger than rp), less force is needed for continued inflation.
