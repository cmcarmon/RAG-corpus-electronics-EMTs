Figure 25.23 is a photomicrograph of a contemporary, high-performance VLSI application-speciÔ¨Åc IC (ASIC)
circuit, the ADSP-1060 (SHARC) digital signal processor (DSP) from Analog Devices, Inc. The right two thirds
of the IC is 4 Mbit of SRAM, providing considerable on-chip memory. The DSP is on the left third of the IC.
A 0.5-mm CMOS technology with two levels of metal was used, with a total of about 20 million transistors on
the IC. The IC provides 120 MFLOP of performance.
