Gated Latches
All other gate level latches and ﬂip-ﬂops are functionally equivalent to either the conﬁguration of the cross-
coupled NOR latch circuit or the cross-coupled NAND latch circuit. A gated S-R NOR latch circuit and a gated
S-R NAND latch are illustrated in Fig. 79.18 along with the recommended IEEE symbol. The reduced charac-
teristic table for both of these circuits is provided in Table 79.11.
