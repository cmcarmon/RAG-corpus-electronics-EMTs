In most Navy transmitters, the hand telegraph key is at a low-voltage potential with respect to 
ground. A keying bar is usually grounded to protect the operator. Generally, a keying relay, with its 
contacts in the center-tap lead of the filament transformer, is used to key the equipment. Because one or 
more stages use the same filament transformer, these stages are also keyed. A class C final amplifier, 
when operated with fixed bias, is usually not keyed. This is because no output occurs when no excitation 
is applied in class C operation. Keying the final amplifier along with the other stages is not necessary in 
this case.
