From our limiting interpretation of the impulse, we see that i in Equation
9.86 is a current that instantaneously delivers the charge CVâ—¦ to the capacitor
at t = 0. Thus, the charge stored in the capacitor takes a step at t = 0, and so
the voltage steps too as driven by the source. This illustrates an important point
made earlier, namely that it takes an infinite current to cause the charge stored
by, and hence the voltage appearing across, a capacitor to take a discontinuous
step. Thus, except under unusual circumstances involving infinite currents, the
state of a capacitor is a continuous function of time.
