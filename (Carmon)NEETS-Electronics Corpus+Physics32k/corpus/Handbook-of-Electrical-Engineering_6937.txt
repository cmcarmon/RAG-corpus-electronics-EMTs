Now consider the example X(t) = A cos(2pf0t) for each t, where f0 is a constant frequency, and the amplitude A
is a random initial condition as given above. There are only two sample functions here: (1) x(t) = cos(2pf0t)
and (2) x(t) = –cos(2pf0t). A related example is X(t) = A cos(2pf0t + F), where A is given above, the phase F
is the uniform random variable on [0,p], and A and F are independent. Again, F and A do not depend on
time (initial random conditions). Thus, the sample functions for X(t) are x(t) = –cos(2pft + f), where F =
f  is  the  value  assumed  initially.  There  are  infinitely  many  sample  functions  because  of  the  phase.  Equation
(73.39b) and the independence of A and F yield
