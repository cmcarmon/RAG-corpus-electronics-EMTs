All resistors (including potentiometers) come with power ratings. Standard, 
run‐of‐the‐mill fixed resistors can handle 1/8 W or 1/4 W, but you can easily find 
1/2 W and 1 W resistors — and some are even flameproof. (Does that make you 
nervous about building circuits?) Of course, you won’t see the power rating 
indicated on the resistor itself (that would make it too easy), so you have to 
figure it out by the size of the resistor (the bigger the resistor, the more power 
it can handle) or get it from the manufacturer or your parts supplier.
