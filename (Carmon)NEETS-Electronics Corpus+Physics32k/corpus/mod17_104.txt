GROUND-TO-AIR.â€”The use of hf radio for ground-to-air communications is similar to ship-to-
shore. The only exception is an aircraft moves more rapidly than a ship. All major circuit improvements 
must be made at the ground station. For example, higher powered transmitters, lower noise receivers, and 
more efficient antennas must be used on the ground.
