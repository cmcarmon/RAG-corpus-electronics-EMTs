Essentially all electric energy is generated in a rotating ma-
chine, the synchronous generator, and most of it is consumed
by electric motors. In many ways, the world’s entire technology
is based on these devices. The study of the behavior of electric
machines is based on three fundamental principles: Ampe`re’s
law, Faraday’s law and Newton’s Law. Various conﬁgurations
result and are classiﬁed generally by the type of electrical
system to which the machine is connected: direct current
(dc) machines or alternating current (ac) machines. Machines
with a dc supply are further divided into permanent magnet
and wound ﬁeld types, as shown in Figure 4.1. The wound
motors are further classiﬁed according to the connections
used. The ﬁeld and armature may have separate sources (sep-
arately excited), they may be connected in parallel (shunt
connected), or they may be series (series connected).
