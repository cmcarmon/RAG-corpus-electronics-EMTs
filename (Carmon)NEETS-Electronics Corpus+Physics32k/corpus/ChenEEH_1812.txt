Guaranteed Service Class
The Guaranteed service class provides ﬁrm end-to-end delay
guarantees. Guaranteed service does not control the minimum
or average delay of packets; merely the maximal queuing delay.
This service guarantees that packets will arrive at the receiver
but in a requested delivery time and will not be discarded due
to queue overﬂows, provided the ﬂow’s trafﬁc stays in its
speciﬁed trafﬁc limits, which are controlled using trafﬁc po-
licing. This service is intended for applications that need a ﬁrm
guarantee that a packet will arrive no later than a certain delay
bound.
