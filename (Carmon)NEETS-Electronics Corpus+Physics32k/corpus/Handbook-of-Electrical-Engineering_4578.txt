The numerical modeling error is itself composed of two components in general, the determination of which
would normally involve one or more kinds of computation. The ﬁrst and generally more important of these
components is the solution error that arises because the computer model used, even if solved exactly, would
not  provide  an  exact  solution  for  the  idealized  problem  representation.  The  solution  error  arises  essentially
because the computer model is solved using a ﬁnite number of unknowns. The other, generally less important
contributor  to  the  numerical  modeling  error  is  the  equation  error  that  arises  because  the  numerical  results
obtained from the computer model used may not numerically satisfy the modeling equations. The equation
error may be caused both by roundoff due to the computer word size as well as the solution algorithm used,
as in the case of iteration, for example. The impact of equation error can be expected to increase with increasing
condition number of the direct matrix.
