If you’d like to change the flash rate, try using different values of R1 (or 
R2 or C1). For instance, using 220 Ω resistors (red‐red‐brown) for both R1 
and R2 produces a flash rate of about 10 pulses per second (10 Hz). And 
 remember to add an on/off switch for the battery if you make this circuit 
 permanent.
