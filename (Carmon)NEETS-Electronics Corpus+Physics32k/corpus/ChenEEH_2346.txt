From what has been illustrated so far, a signal of a given
frequency can propagate in a rectangular waveguide in several
modes for which the cutoff frequencies are less than the signal
frequencies. Waveguides, are however, designed so that only
one mode, the one with the lowest cutoff frequency, propa-
gates. This is known as the dominant mode. The reason for
using a single-mode waveguide is because in a multimode
waveguide, the total energy is distributed among the propagat-
ing modes. For such a case, the instrumentation (e.g., detec-
tors, exitation probes, etc.) required to detect the total power
of multimode is more complex compared to instrumentation
needed for single-mode operation.
