The table of electric currents and their various bodily effects was obtained from online (Inter-
net) sources: the safety page of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (website: (https://ehs.mit.edu/workplace-safety-program/electrical-safety/)
and a safety handbook published by Cooper Bussmann, Inc (website: (http://www.bussmann.com)).
In the Bussmann handbook, the table is appropriately entitled Deleterious Effects of Electric
Shock, and credited to a Mr. Charles F. Dalziel. Further research revealed Dalziel to be both a
scientiÔ¨Åc pioneer and an authority on the effects of electricity on the human body.
