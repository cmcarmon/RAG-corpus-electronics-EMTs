1. For circuits with more than one connected disjoint
subcircuit, these connected disjoint parts are identi-
ﬁed and marked. This step does not incur any com-
putational overhead—it is an inherent feature of the
depth-ﬁrst search graph traversal algorithm to separ-
ate a graph into disjoint pieces (if any).
