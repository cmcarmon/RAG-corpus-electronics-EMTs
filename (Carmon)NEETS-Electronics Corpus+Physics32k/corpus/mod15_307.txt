Note that it is easy to move the gyro as long as you keep the axis POINTING in the SAME 
DIRECTION. The gyro resists only those forces that tend to change the direction of its axis. In a bicycle, 
since the axis of rotation (the wheel's axles) is horizontal, the wheels win resist any force that tends to tilt 
or turn them to the right or left.
