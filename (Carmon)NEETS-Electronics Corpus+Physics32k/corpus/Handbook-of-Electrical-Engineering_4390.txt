Material and waveguide dispersion can have different signs and effectively cancel each other’s dispersive effect
on  the  total  dispersion  in  a  single-mode  ﬁber.  In  conventional  germanium-doped  silica  ﬁbers,  the  “zero-
dispersion’’  wavelength  at  which  the  waveguide  and  material  dispersion  effects  cancel  each  other  out  occurs
near 1.30 mm. The zero-dispersion wavelength can be shifted to 1.55 mm, or the low-dispersion characteristics
of a ﬁber can be broadened by modifying the refractive index proﬁle shape of a single-mode ﬁber. This proﬁle
shape  modiﬁcation  alters  the  waveguide  dispersion  characteristics  of  the  ﬁber  and  changes  the  wavelength
region in which waveguide and material dispersion effects cancel each other. Figure 42.19 illustrates the proﬁle
shapes of “conventional,’’ “dispersion-shifted,” and “dispersion-ﬂattened’’ single-mode ﬁbers. Single-mode ﬁbers
operating  in  their  zero-dispersion  region  with  system  sources  of  ﬁnite  spectral  width  do  not  have  inﬁnite
bandwidth but have bandwidths that are high enough to satisfy all current high-capacity system requirements.
