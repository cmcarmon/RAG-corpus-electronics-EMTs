Both magma movement, changes in gas release and hydrothermal activity can lead to thermal emissivity changes at the volcano's surface. These can be measured using several techniques:
forward looking infrared radiometry (FLIR) from hand-held devices installed on-site, at a distance, or airborne;
infrared band satellite imagery;
in-situ thermometry (hot springs, fumaroles)
heat flux maps
geothermal well enthalpy changes
