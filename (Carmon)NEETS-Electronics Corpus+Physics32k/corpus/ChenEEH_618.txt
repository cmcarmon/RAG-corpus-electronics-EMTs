in which X is the actual value and ^XX is the corresponding value
representable in the system. Notice that X 6¼ ^XX due to the
ﬁnite length of the words. Assuming that the logarithm of X
is represented as a two’s complement number, the relative
representational error erel, LNS for a (k, l, b)–LNS is independ-
ent of X and, therefore, is equal to the average representational
error. It is given by [refer to Koren (1993) for the case b ¼ 2].
