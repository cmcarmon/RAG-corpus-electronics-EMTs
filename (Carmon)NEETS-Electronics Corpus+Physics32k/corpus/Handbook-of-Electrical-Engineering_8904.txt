Research  issues  associated  with  improving  the  performance  of  the  virtual  memory  system  fall  under  the
domain  of  operating  system  research.  One  proposed  strategy  for  reducing  page  faults  allows  each  running
program to specify its own page replacement algorithm, enabling each program to optimize the choice of page
replacements based on its reference pattern [Engler et al., 1995]. Other recent research focuses on improving
the performance of the TLB. Two techniques for doing this are the use of a two-level TLB (the motivation is
similar  to  that  for  a  two-level  cache),  and  the  use  of  superpages  [Talluri,  1994]. With  superpages,  each  TLB
entry  may  represent  a  mapping  for  more  than  one  consecutive  page,  thus  increasing  the  total  address  range
that a Ô¨Åxed number of TLB entries may cover.
