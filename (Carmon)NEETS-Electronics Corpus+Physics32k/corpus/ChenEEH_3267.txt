Now, if a second set of windings, the secondary windings, is
wrapped around the core as shown in Figure 7.1(B), the two
currents will be linked by magnetic induction. Assuming that
no ﬂux ﬂows outside the core, then the two windings will see
the exact same ﬂux, f. Because the two windings also see the
same core reluctance, the two mmfs are identical:
