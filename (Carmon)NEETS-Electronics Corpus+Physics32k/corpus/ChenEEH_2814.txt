Discretization Error
The design of an effective PML requires balancing the theoret-
ical reﬂection error R(u) and the numerical discretization
error. For example, equation 9.128 provides sx, max for a
polynomial-graded conductivity given a predetermined R(0)
and m. If sx, max is too small, the primary reﬂection from the
PML is due to its PEC backing, and equation 9.125 provides a
fairly accurate approximation of the reﬂection error. However,
if sx, max is too large, the discretization error due to the FDTD
approximation dominates, and the actual reﬂection error is
potentially much higher than what equation 9.125 predicts.
Consequently, there is an optimal choice for sx, max that bal-
ances reﬂection from the PEC outer boundary and discretiza-
tion error.
