Transmission Line Parameters
As mentioned previously, electric power is transmitted in three
phases. This accounts for the common site of three lines or for
dual circuits of six lines seen strung between transmission
towers. Typically, a high-voltage transmission line has several
feet of spacing between the three conductors. The conductors
are stranded wire for improved mechanical as well as electrical
properties. If the currents are expected to be large, several
conductors may be strung per phase. This improves cooling
