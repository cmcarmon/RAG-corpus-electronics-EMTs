Rotational or angular kinematics is the description of the rotation of an object. The description of rotation requires some method for describing orientation. Common descriptions include Euler angles and the kinematics of turns induced by algebraic products.
In what follows, attention is restricted to simple rotation about an axis of fixed orientation. The z-axis has been chosen for convenience.
Position
This allows the description of a rotation as the angular position of a planar reference frame M relative to a fixed F about this shared z-axis. Coordinates p = (x, y) in M are related to coordinates P = (X, Y) in F by the matrix equation:

is the rotation matrix that defines the angular position of M relative to F as a function of time.
Velocity
If the point p does not move in M, its velocity in F is given by

{\displaystyle \mathbf {V} _{P}={\dot {\mathbf {P} }}=[{\dot {A}}(t)]\mathbf {p} .}


It is convenient to eliminate the coordinates p and write this as an operation on the trajectory P(t),

The description of rotation then involves these three quantities:
Angular position : the oriented distance from a selected origin on the rotational axis to a point of an object is a vector r ( t ) locating the point. The vector r(t) has some projection (or, equivalently, some component) r⊥(t) on a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation. Then the angular position of that point is the angle θ from a reference axis (typically the positive x-axis) to the vector r⊥(t) in a known rotation sense (typically given by the right-hand rule).
Angular velocity : the angular velocity ω is the rate at which the angular position θ changes with respect to time t:




ω
=



d
θ


d
t





{\displaystyle \omega ={\frac {d\theta }{dt}}}


The angular velocity is represented in Figure 1 by a vector Ω pointing along the axis of rotation with magnitude ω and sense determined by the direction of rotation as given by the right-hand rule.
Angular acceleration : the magnitude of the angular acceleration α is the rate at which the angular velocity ω changes with respect to time t:




α
=



d
ω


d
t





{\displaystyle \alpha ={\frac {d\omega }{dt}}}


The equations of translational kinematics can easily be extended to planar rotational kinematics for constant angular acceleration with simple variable exchanges:

{\displaystyle \omega _{\mathrm {f} }^{2}=\omega _{\mathrm {i} }^{2}+2\alpha (\theta _{\mathrm {f} }-\theta _{\mathrm {i} }).}

Here θi and θf are, respectively, the initial and final angular positions, ωi and ωf are, respectively, the initial and final angular velocities, and α is the constant angular acceleration. Although position in space and velocity in space are both true vectors (in terms of their properties under rotation), as is angular velocity, angle itself is not a true vector.
