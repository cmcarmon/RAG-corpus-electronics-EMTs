For a non-conservative force which depends on velocity, it may be possible to find a potential energy function V that depends on positions and velocities. If the generalized forces Qi can be derived from a potential V such that

equating to Lagrange's equations and defining the Lagrangian as L = T − V obtains Lagrange's equations of the second kind or the Euler–Lagrange equations of motion

However, the Euler–Lagrange equations can only account for non-conservative forces if a potential can be found as shown. This may not always be possible for non-conservative forces, and Lagrange's equations do not involve any potential, only generalized forces; therefore they are more general than the Euler–Lagrange equations.
The Euler–Lagrange equations also follow from the calculus of variations. The variation of the Lagrangian is

{\displaystyle \delta L=\sum _{j=1}^{n}\left({\frac {\partial L}{\partial q_{j}}}\delta q_{j}+{\frac {\partial L}{\partial {\dot {q}}_{j}}}\delta {\dot {q}}_{j}\right)\,,\quad \delta {\dot {q}}_{j}\equiv \delta {\frac {\mathrm {d} q_{j}}{\mathrm {d} t}}\equiv {\frac {\mathrm {d} (\delta q_{j})}{\mathrm {d} t}}\,,}

which has a similar form to the total differential of L, but the virtual displacements and their time derivatives replace differentials, and there is no time increment in accordance with the definition of the virtual displacements. An integration by parts with respect to time can transfer the time derivative of δqj to the ∂L/∂(dqj/dt), in the process exchanging d(δqj)/dt for δqj, allowing the independent virtual displacements to be factorized from the derivatives of the Lagrangian,

{\displaystyle \int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\delta L\,\mathrm {d} t=\sum _{j=1}^{n}\left[{\frac {\partial L}{\partial {\dot {q}}_{j}}}\delta q_{j}\right]_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}+\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\sum _{j=1}^{n}\left({\frac {\partial L}{\partial q_{j}}}-{\frac {\mathrm {d} }{\mathrm {d} t}}{\frac {\partial L}{\partial {\dot {q}}_{j}}}\right)\delta q_{j}\,\mathrm {d} t\,.}

Now, if the condition δqj(t1) = δqj(t2) = 0 holds for all j, the terms not integrated are zero. If in addition the entire time integral of δL is zero, then because the δqj are independent, and the only way for a definite integral to be zero is if the integrand equals zero, each of the coefficients of δqj must also be zero. Then we obtain the equations of motion. This can be summarized by Hamilton's principle;

The time integral of the Lagrangian is another quantity called the action, defined as

{\displaystyle S=\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}L\,\mathrm {d} t\,,}

which is a functional; it takes in the Lagrangian function for all times between t1 and t2 and returns a scalar value. Its dimensions are the same as [ angular momentum ], [energy]·[time], or [length]·[momentum]. With this definition Hamilton's principle is

{\displaystyle \delta S=0\,.}

Thus, instead of thinking about particles accelerating in response to applied forces, one might think of them picking out the path with a stationary action, with the end points of the path in configuration space held fixed at the initial and final times. Hamilton's principle is sometimes referred to as the principle of least action, however the action functional need only be stationary, not necessarily a maximum or a minimum value. Any variation of the functional gives an increase in the functional integral of the action.
Historically, the idea of finding the shortest path a particle can follow subject to a force motivated the first applications of the calculus of variations to mechanical problems, such as the Brachistochrone problem solved by Jean Bernoulli in 1696, as well as Leibniz, Daniel Bernoulli, L'Hôpital around the same time, and Newton the following year. Newton himself was thinking along the lines of the variational calculus, but did not publish. These ideas in turn lead to the variational principles of mechanics, of Fermat, Maupertuis, Euler, Hamilton, and others.
Hamilton's principle can be applied to nonholonomic constraints if the constraint equations can be put into a certain form, a linear combination of first order differentials in the coordinates. The resulting constraint equation can be rearranged into first order differential equation. This will not be given here.
