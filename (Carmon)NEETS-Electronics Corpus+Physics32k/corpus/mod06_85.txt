Voltage may be supplied by a separate filament transformer or it may be taken from a filament
winding that is part of a power transformer. The actual voltage may vary from 1 volt up and depends on
the design of the tube. Common filament voltages are 5.0, 6.3, and 12.6 volts ac. Filaments may be
connected in series with other tube filaments or may be in parallel with each other. This is determined by
the equipment designer.
