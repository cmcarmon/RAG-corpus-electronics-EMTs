15.1.23 A signal with bandwidth of 100 MHz is to be
transmitted 40 km by LOS radio transmission.
Taking B/fc = 1/30, and using a circular-aperture
parabolic dish with 50-cm radius at each end,
compute the transmission loss.
*15.1.24 Consider the LOS radio system of Figure 15.1.6,
with dipole antennas. Let Pin = 10 W, R = 20 km,
Gt = Gr = 2 dB, and fc = 500 MHz. Compute Pout.
15.1.25 A satellite radio transmitter has Pin = 3 W and
Gt = 30 dB. The receiving antenna has a circular
aperture with radius r at the ground station 30,000
km away. Find r in meters if Pout = 30 pW.
