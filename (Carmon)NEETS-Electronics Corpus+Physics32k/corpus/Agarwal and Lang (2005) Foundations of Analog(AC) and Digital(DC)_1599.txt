As current flows through the resistors, energy is dissipated. However, the
capacitor does not dissipate energy. It simply stores energy when the switch
is closed (during T1) and supplies this stored energy when the switch is open
(during T2). We can derive the instantaneous power p(t) dissipated in the circuit
as a function of time. We can also derive the average power p dissipated by the
circuit.
