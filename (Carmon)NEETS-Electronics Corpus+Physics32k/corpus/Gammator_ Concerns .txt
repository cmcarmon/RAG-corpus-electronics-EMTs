Because of the massive shielding of a Gammator, the machine is very safe when used as intended (e.g. school science experiments); according to the Los Alamos National Laboratory, it is similar to machines used to irradiate blood. However, this amount of nuclear material could pose a significant problem if used as the radioactive component in a dirty bomb.
