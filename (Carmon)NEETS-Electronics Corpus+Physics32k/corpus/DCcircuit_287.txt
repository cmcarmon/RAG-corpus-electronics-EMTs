Measuring electrical resistance with a sensitive meter, I measure approximately 1 million
ohms of resistance (1 MΩ) between my two hands, holding on to the meter’s metal probes
between my ﬁngers. The meter indicates less resistance when I squeeze the probes tightly and
more resistance when I hold them loosely. Sitting here at my computer, typing these words,
my hands are clean and dry. If I were working in some hot, dirty, industrial environment, the
resistance between my hands would likely be much less, presenting less opposition to deadly
current, and a greater threat of electrical shock.
