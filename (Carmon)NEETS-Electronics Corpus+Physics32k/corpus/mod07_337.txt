Transistors are semiconductor devices with three or more terminals. The operation of normal 
transistors has already been discussed, but there are several transistors with special properties that should 
be explained. As with diodes, a discussion of all the developments in the transistor field would be 
impossible. The unijunction transistor (UJT) and the field effect transistor (FET) will be discussed 
because of their widespread application in Navy equipment. Many other special transistors have been 
developed and will be discussed in later NEETS modules.
