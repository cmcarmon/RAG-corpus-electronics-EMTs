It  is  interesting  to  contrast  these  proprietary  approaches  with  an  industry  standard  approach  like  SCSI,
admittedly targeted for the low to mid range of performance. SCSI deﬁnes the logical and physical interface
between  a  host  bus  adapter  (HBA)  and  a  disk  controller,  usually  embedded  within  the  assembly  of  the  disk
device. The HBA accepts I/O requests from the host, initiates I/O actions by communicating with the controllers,
and performs direct memory access transfers between its own buffers and the memory of the host. Requesters
of service are called initiators, while providers of service are called targets. Up to eight nodes can reside on a
single SCSI string, sharing a common pathway to the HBA. The embedded controller performs device handling
and  error  recovery.  Physically,  the  interface  is  implemented  with  a  single  daisy-chained  cable,  and  the  8-bit
datapath  is  used  to  communicate  control  and  status  information,  as  well  as  data.  SCSI  deﬁnes  a  layered
communications protocol, including a message layer for protocol and status, and a command/status layer for
target  operation  execution.  The  HBA  roughly  corresponds  to  the  function  of  the  IBM  channel  processor  or
Cray IOP, while the embedded controller is similar to the IBM storage director/string controller or the Cray
DCU. Despite the differences in terminology, the systems we have surveyed exhibut signiﬁcant commonality
of function and similar approaches for partitioning these functions among hardware components.
