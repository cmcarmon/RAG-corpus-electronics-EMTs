The interconnect problem has become signiÔ¨Åcant enough to
require entire architectural pipe stages in the Pentium IV
processor for interconnect communication (Intel, 2001). At
the circuit level, widespread use of repeaters has become nec-
essary. To avoid degrading interconnect resistance, the vertical
dimension of metals has scaled very weakly compared to the
horizontal dimension, leading to extremely high height and
width aspect ratios (2-2.2) (see Figure 8.12).
