WARR Space-Elevator is developing climber robots since its founding in 2006, and also organizes corresponding competitions. The first climber was developed for the JSETEC2009 competition and reached the targeted 150 m in the shortest time. In 2011 the European Space Elevator Challenge (EUSPEC) was established, which also focused on energy efficiency. Following that year the competition was repeated with increased cable length of 50 m.
