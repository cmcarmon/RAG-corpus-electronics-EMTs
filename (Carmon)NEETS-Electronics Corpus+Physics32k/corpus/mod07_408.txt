In terms of peak value, the average value of current and voltage at the output of the full-wave 
rectifier is twice as great as that at the output of the half-wave rectifier. The relationship between the peak 
value and the average value is illustrated in figure 4-7. Since the output waveform is essentially a sine 
wave with both alternations at the same polarity, the average current or voltage is 63.7 percent (or 0.637) 
of the peak current or voltage.
