All ferroelectric and piezoelectric materials have phase transitions at which the material changes crystalline
symmetry. For example, in PZT there is a change from tetragonal or rhombohedral symmetry to cubic as the
temperature is increased. The temperature at which the material changes crystalline phases is called the Curie
temperature, TQ. For typical PZT compositions the Curie temperature is between 250 and 450(cid:176)C.
