Quadrature Amplitude Modulation
Quadrature  carrier  signaling  is  called  quadrature  amplitude  modulation  (QAM).  In  general,  QAM  signal
constellations are not restricted to having permitted signaling points only on a circle (of radius Ac, as was the
case for MPSK). The general QAM signal is
