The MMSE estimator, Eq. (15.4), is intuitively appealing. It uses a predesigned set of ﬁlters {H–x t,} obtained
from training data of speech and noise. Each ﬁlter is optimal for a pair of subsources of the CSMs for the clean
signal and the noise process. Since each subsource represents a subset of signals from the corresponding source,
each ﬁlter is optimal for a pair of signal subsets from the speech and noise. The set of predesigned ﬁlters covers
all possible pairs of speech and noise signal subsets. Hence, for each noisy vector of speech there must exist an
optimal  ﬁlter  in  the  set  of  predesigned  ﬁlters.  Since,  however,  a  vector  of  the  noisy  signal  could  possibly  be
generated  from  any  pair  of  subsources  of  the  clean  signal  and  noise,  the  most  appropriate  ﬁlter  for  a  given
noisy vector is not known. Consequently, in estimating the signal vector at each time instant, all ﬁlters are tried
and their outputs are weighted by the probabilities of the ﬁlters to be correct for the given noisy signal. Other
strategies for utilizing the predesigned set of ﬁlters are possible. For example, at each time instant only the most
likely ﬁlter can be applied to the noisy signal. This approach is more intuitive than that of the MMSE estimation.
It was ﬁrst proposed in Drucker [1968] for a ﬁve-state model which comprises subsources for fricatives, stops,
vowels, glides, and nasals. This approach was shown by Ephraim and Merhav [Ephraim, 1992] to be optimal
only in an asymptotic MMSE sense.
