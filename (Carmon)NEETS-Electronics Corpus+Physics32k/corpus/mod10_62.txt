A WAVELENGTH is the distance in space occupied by one cycle of a radio wave at any given
instant. If the wave could be frozen in place and measured, the wavelength would be the distance from the
leading edge of one cycle to the corresponding point on the next cycle. Wavelengths vary from a few
hundredths of an inch at extremely high frequencies to many miles at extremely low frequencies;
however, common practice is to express wavelengths in meters. Therefore, in figure 1-7 (wave 1), the

signify wavelength. Why lambda and not "l" or "L"? This is because "L" is used conventionally as the
