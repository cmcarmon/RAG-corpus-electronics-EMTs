When a reaction converts a metal from a singlet to triplet state (or vice-versa), two parameters must be met:
The potential energy of the two spin states must be nearly equal; this is governed by the reaction conditions,
The metal should be able to change spin states readily through spin-orbital coupling.
Strong spin-orbital coupling can allow for the 2nd parameter to be easily met. Parameter 1, however, can lead to very slow reactions due to grossly large disparities between the metal complex's potential energy surfaces, which only cross at high energy leading to a substantial activation barrier.
Spin-forbidden reactions formally fall into the category of electronically non-adiabatic reactions. In general, potential energy surfaces fall into either the adiabatic and diabatic classification. Potential Energy Surfaces that are adiabatic rely on the use of the full electronic Hamiltonian, which includes the spin-orbit term. Those that are diabatic are likewise derived by solving the eigenvalues of the Schr√∂dinger equation, but in this case one or more terms are omitted.
