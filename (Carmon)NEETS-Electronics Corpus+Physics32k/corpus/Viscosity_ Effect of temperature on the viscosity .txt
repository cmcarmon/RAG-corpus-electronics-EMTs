Sutherland's formula can be used to derive the dynamic viscosity of an ideal gas as a function of the temperature:

{\displaystyle \mu =\mu _{0}{\frac {T_{0}+C}{T+C}}\left({\frac {T}{T_{0}}}\right)^{\frac {3}{2}}.}

{\displaystyle \lambda ={\frac {\mu _{0}\left(T_{0}+C\right)}{T_{0}^{\frac {3}{2}}}}}

is a constant for the gas.
in Sutherland's formula:
μ = dynamic viscosity (Pa·s or μPa·s) at input temperature T,
μ0 = reference viscosity (in the same units as μ) at reference temperature T0,
T = input temperature (K),
T0 = reference temperature (K),
C = Sutherland's constant for the gaseous material in question.
Valid for temperatures between 0 < T < 555 K with an error due to pressure less than 10% below 3.45 MPa.
According to Sutherland's formula, if the absolute temperature is less than C, the relative change in viscosity for a small change in temperature is greater than the relative change in the absolute temperature, but it is smaller when T is above C. The kinematic viscosity though always increases faster than the temperature (that is, d log(ν)/d log(T) is greater than 1).
