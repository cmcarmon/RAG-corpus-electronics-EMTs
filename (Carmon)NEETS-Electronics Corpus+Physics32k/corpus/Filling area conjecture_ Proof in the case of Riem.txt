In the same paper where Gromov stated the conjecture, he proved it in the case that the Riemannian filling surface is homeomorphic to a disk, as follows.
Let



M


{\displaystyle M}
be a (piecewise smooth) Riemannian disk



M


{\displaystyle M}
that isometrically fills its boundary of length



2
L


{\displaystyle 2L}
. If we glue each boundary point with its opposite, we obtain a closed Riemannian surface




M
â€²



{\displaystyle M'}
homeomorphic to the real projective plane and with systole equal to



L


{\displaystyle L}
. (And reciprocally, if we cut open a projective plane along a shortest noncontractible loop of length



L


{\displaystyle L}
, we obtain a disk that fills isometrically its boundary of length



2
L


{\displaystyle 2L}
.) Thus the minimum area that



M


{\displaystyle M}
can have is equal to the minimum area that a Riemannian projective plane of systole



L


{\displaystyle L}
can have. But Pu's systolic inequality asserts precisely that such a projective plane has minimum area if and only if it is round (that is, obtained from an Euclidean sphere by identifying each point with its opposite). The area of this round projective plane equals the area of the hemisphere (each of them is half the area of the sphere).
