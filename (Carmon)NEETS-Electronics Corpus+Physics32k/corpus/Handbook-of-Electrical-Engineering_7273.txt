Plenty of Bandwidth in an Otherwise Crowded Spectrum
The second major advantage of 18-GHz radio is its available bandwidth. Few other areas of the electromagnetic
spectrum  are  as  interference-free,  clear,  and  available  as  this  band,  certainly  not  the VHF  and  UHF  bands,
which must accommodate television, FM radio, cellular telephone, baby monitors, and more.
