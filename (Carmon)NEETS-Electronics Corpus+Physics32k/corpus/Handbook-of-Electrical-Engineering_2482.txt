The 3-dB or half-power frequency of this ampliÔ¨Åer stage will be
a  function  of  f1  and  f2.  If  these  two  breakpoint  frequencies  are
separated by at least a decade (i.e., 10:1 ratio), the 3-dB frequency
will  be  approximately  equal  to  the  lower  of  the  two  breakpoint
frequencies.  If  the  breakpoint  frequencies  are  not  well  separated,
then the 3-dB frequency can be obtained from the following approx-
imate  relationship:  (1/f3dB)2  @  (1/f1)2  +  (1/f2)2.  The  time-domain
response as expressed in terms of the 10 to 90% rise time is related
to the frequency-domain response by the approximate relationship
that trise @ 0.35/f3dB.
