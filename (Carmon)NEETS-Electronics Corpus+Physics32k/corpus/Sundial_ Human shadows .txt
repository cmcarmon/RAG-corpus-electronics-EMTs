The length of a human shadow (or of any vertical object) can be used to measure the sun's elevation and, thence, the time. The Venerable Bede gave a table for estimating the time from the length of one's shadow in feet, on the assumption that a monk's height is six times the length of his foot. Such shadow lengths will vary with the geographical latitude and with the time of year. For example, the shadow length at noon is short in summer months, and long in winter months.
Chaucer evokes this method a few times in his Canterbury Tales, as in his Parson's Tale.
An equivalent type of sundial using a vertical rod of fixed length is known as a backstaff dial.
