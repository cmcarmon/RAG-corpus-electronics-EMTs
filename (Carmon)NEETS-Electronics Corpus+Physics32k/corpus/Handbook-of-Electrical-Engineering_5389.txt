More  than  a  decade  later,  the  advances  in  high-efﬁciency  solar  photovoltaics  and  innovations  in  selective
emitter development prompted renewed interest in TPV systems. Solar-to-electric energy conversion efﬁciencies
greater than 30% were achieved in multiple-junction structures. These devices exploit the range of properties
that  can  be  obtained  from  III–V  semiconductors.  The  ability  to  tune  the  photocell  to  a  desired  response
characteristic provided the degree of freedom necessary to address the remaining system design issues effectively.
