Several categories of noise are present in digital circuits. These
include series resistance, dynamic charge sharing of hard and
soft nodes, and I/O integrity, which are the types discussed in
this chapter. They can appear in any combination, but for
simplicity, the analysis below considers each noise source in-
dependently. All are strongly dependent on the speciÔ¨Åcations
of the semiconductor manufacturing process, the physical
arrangement of gates and interconnections on an integrated
circuit, the switching frequency, and the relative activity level
of adjacent gates or interconnections.
