A solvent is used for cleaning and removing contaminants (oil, grease, dirt, and so forth) from the 
soldered connection. Solvents must be nonconductive and noncorrosive. Solvents must be used in a 
manner that keeps dissolved flux residue from "contact" surfaces, such as those in switches, 
potentiometers, or connectors. Ethyl and isopropyl alcohol are acceptable solvents.
