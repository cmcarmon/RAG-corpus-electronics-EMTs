In the context of electric power generation, the role of biomass is expected to be for repowering old units
and for use in small (20 to 50 MW) new plants. Several new high-efﬁciency conversion technologies are either
already  available  or  under  development  for  the  utilization  of  biomass.  The  technologies  and  their  overall
conversion efﬁciencies are listed below.
