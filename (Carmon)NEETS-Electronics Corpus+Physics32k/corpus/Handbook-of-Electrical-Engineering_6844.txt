There are two basic types of digital communications applications in which the problem (73.18) arises. One
is  in  M-ary  data  transmission,  in  which  a  symbol  alphabet  with  M  elements  is  used  to  transmit  data,  and  a
decision  among  these  M  symbols  must  be  made  in  each  symbol  interval  [Proakis,  1983].  The  other  type  of
application  in  which  (73.18)  arises  is  that  in  which  data  symbols  are  correlated  in  some  way  because  of
intersymbol  interference,  coding,  or  multiuser  transmission.  In  such  cases,  each  of  the  M  possible  signals
represents a frame of data symbols, and a joint decision must be made about the entire frame since individual
symbol decisions cannot be decoupled. Within this latter framework, the problem (73.18) is known as sequence
detection. The basic distinction between M-ary transmission and sequence detection is one of degree. In typical
M-ary transmission, the number of elements in the signaling alphabet is typically a small power of 2 (say 8 or
32), whereas the number of symbols in a frame of data could be on the order of thousands. Thus, solution of
(73.18) by exhaustive search is prohibitive for sequence detection, and less complex algorithms must be used.
Typical digital communications applications in which sequence detection is necessary admit dynamic program-
ming solutions to (73.18) (see, e.g., Verd√∫ [1993]).
