There are two techniques to prevent electrical 
shock when using electrical tools and equipment. 
They are insulating and grounding. Insulating refers 
to using a material that does not support current flow. 
Copper wire conductors are normally insulated. Hand 
and power tools and appliances contain layers of insu-
lating material between the interior parts and the exte-
rior housing.
