New mechanical arms being used for prosthetics are starting to gain sensors that, with the help of a chip attached to one's spinal cord, allows a person to move the arm. Since sensors can easily be programmed to have a higher sensitivity to anything the sensor touches, people with prosthetic arms will also be able to feel the object they are touching. With this, a person could feel even the slightest vibration. This could be a danger and a good thing. It can danger the human because if dealt with to much pressure the person with the prosthetic can suffer severe pain. Besides actually obtaining the sense of touch back, one could also sense more awareness of incoming danger.
