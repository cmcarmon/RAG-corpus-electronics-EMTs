Thus with negative feedback a given percentage change in the Op Amp gain A
results in a much smaller percentage change in the overall circuit gain G, smaller
by a factor 1 + AR2/(R1 + R2). Note from Equation 15.7 that this is exactly
the factor by which the gain is reduced as a result of applying the feedback. By
inspection of Figure 15.7, the gain term AR2/(R1 + R2) represents the gain for
a signal traveling all the way around the feedback loop: through the Op Amp
with its gain of A, then through the feedback resistor network with a ‘‘gain’’ of
R2/(R1 + R2), (hence called the loop gain). In general, for negative feedback,
gain changes are suppressed by a factor 1 + (loop gain), and the overall gain is
reduced by this same factor.
