For determining the condition of the ideal diode, let us initially assume that it does not conduct,
and let us replace it with an open circuit, as shown in Figure E7.2.1(b). The voltage across the
10- resistor can be calculated as 8 V by the voltage-divider rule. Then, applying KVL around
the right-hand loop, we get
