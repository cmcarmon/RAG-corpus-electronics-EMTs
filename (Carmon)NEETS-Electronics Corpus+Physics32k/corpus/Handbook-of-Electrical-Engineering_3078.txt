Both low-pass and high-pass frequency response circuits can be achieved using three operational ampliﬁer
circuits. Such circuits have some sensitivity function and tuning advantages but require far more components.
These circuits are used in the sections describing bandpass and bandstop ﬁlters. The designer wanting to use
the  three-operational-ampliﬁer  realization  for  low-pass  or  high-pass  ﬁlters  can  easily  do  this  using  simple
modiﬁcations of the circuits shown in the following sections.
