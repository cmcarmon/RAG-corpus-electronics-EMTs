When the callee picks up the action, the stack and registers are as shown in Figure 87.5. With the exception
of D0 and A7, the callee has no registers . . . yet. The callee must make room for local variables in either register
or memory. If it wants to use registers, it must save the user’s data from the registers. The subroutine can get
whatever space it needs on the stack. Only after the setup will it get down to work. The entire section of stack
used for local variables and saving registers is called the callee’s frame. It is useful to have a pointer (FP) to the
bottom  of  the  frame  to  provide  a  static  reference  to  the  return  address,  the  passed  parameters,  and  the
subroutine’s local variable area on the stack. In the 68000, the convention is to use A6 as FP. When our routine,
NumberCount, begins, the address in A6 points to the start of the caller’s frame. The ﬁrst thing the callee must
do is to establish a local frame. It does that with the instruction LINK.
