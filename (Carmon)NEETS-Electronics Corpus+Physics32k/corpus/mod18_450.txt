The distribution of power over the radar frequency spectrum depends on the amount of modulation. 
A pulsed radar spectrum is illustrated in figure 4-2. The vertical lines represent the modulation 
frequencies produced by the prf and its associated harmonics; the lobes represent the modulation 
frequencies produced by the fundamental pulse frequency and its associated harmonics. The amplitude of 
the main lobe falls to zero on each side of the carrier. The side lobes are produced by the odd harmonics 
of the fundamental pulse frequency. The zero points are produced by the even harmonics of the 
fundamental pulse frequency. In an ideal spectrum each frequency above the carrier has its counterpart in 
another frequency below the carrier. These frequencies are equally spaced and have equal power. 
Therefore, the pattern is symmetrical about the carrier. The main lobe, of course, contains the major 
portion of the transmitted rf energy.
