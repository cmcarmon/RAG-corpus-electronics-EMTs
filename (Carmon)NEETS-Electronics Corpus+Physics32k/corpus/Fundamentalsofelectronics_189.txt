To illustrate how the time domain, the frequency domain and impedances ﬁt together, consider the time
domain and frequency domain to be two work rooms. Since you can’t be two places at the same time, you
are faced with solving your circuit problem in one of the two rooms at any point in time. Impedances and
complex exponentials are the way you get between the two rooms. Security guards make sure you don’t try
to sneak time domain variables into the frequency domain room and vice versa. Figure 3.23 shows how this
works.
