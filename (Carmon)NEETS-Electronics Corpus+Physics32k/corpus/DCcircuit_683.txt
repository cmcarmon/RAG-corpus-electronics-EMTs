Now, the voltmeter can only indicate the voltage its connected across. It has no way of
”knowing” there was a potential of 12 volts dropped across the lower 250 MΩ resistor before it
was connected across it. The very act of connecting the voltmeter to the circuit makes it part of
the circuit, and the voltmeter’s own resistance alters the resistance ratio of the voltage divider
circuit, consequently affecting the voltage being measured.
