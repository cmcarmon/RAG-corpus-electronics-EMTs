As M gets larger, the performance of copper transmission lines—twisted pairs or coax—becomes unsatis-
factory because of attenuation and pulse dispersion. The economic break-even value for M, where the added
cost of lightwave technology is justiﬁed, though not precise, is in the neighborhood of 500 bits. In this section,
we will cover aspects of lightwave data networks that utilize the lightwave technology discussed in Section 71.2
and  some  of  the  multiple-access  methods  for  LANs  discussed  in  Section  66.3.  The  latter  section  touches  on
commercial LAN standards that utilize optical data links for point-to-point transmission between nodes, often
with  multimode  ﬁber.  Here,  we  will  ﬁrst  discuss  some  of  the  recent  optical  LAN  standards  and  then  brieﬂy
mention  proposed  approaches  to  photonic  networks  with  terabit-per-second  throughput  and  gigabit-per-
second user access, and the novel optical components that are needed to realize this high performance. When
such  networks  connect  users  separated  by  L  ~  1000s  of  kilometers,  M  ~  10s  of  megabits  may  be  in  transit,
requiring new approaches to congestion control for multiple access.
