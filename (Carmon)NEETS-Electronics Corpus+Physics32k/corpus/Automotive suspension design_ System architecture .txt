Typically a vehicle designer is operating within a set of constraints. The suspension architecture selected for each end of the vehicle will have to obey those constraints. For both ends of the car this would include the type of spring, location of the spring, and location of the shock absorbers.
For the front suspension the following need to be considered
The type of suspension (MacPherson strut or double wishbone suspension)
Type of steering actuator (rack and pinion or recirculating ball)
Location of the steering actuator in front of, or behind, the wheel centre
For the rear suspension there are many more possible suspension types, in practice.
