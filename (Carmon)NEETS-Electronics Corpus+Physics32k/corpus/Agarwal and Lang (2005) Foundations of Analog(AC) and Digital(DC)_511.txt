Equation 3.115 should be familiar from Section 1.7. It is the same as Equa-
tion 1.23, the volt-ampere relation for a voltage source in series with a resistor.
In graphical terms it is the equation of a straight line in the v i plane with
slope 1/Rt and voltage axis intercept voc. So the preceding calculation can be
interpreted in terms of a circuit called the Th√©venin equivalent circuit shown in
Figure 3.56. If voc and Rt are calculated using the subcircuits in Figure 3.55c
and 3.55d, then this circuit and the one in Figure 3.55a are equivalent, in the
sense that any measurement at the indicated terminals are equivalent. In other
words, any measurement at the indicated terminals of the two circuits will yield
identical results.
