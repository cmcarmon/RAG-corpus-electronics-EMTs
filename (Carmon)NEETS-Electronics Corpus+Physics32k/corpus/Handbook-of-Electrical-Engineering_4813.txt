This origin of piezoelectricity in electrostriction provides us an avenue into nonlinearity. In this case, it is the
ability  to  tune  the  piezoelectric  coefﬁcient  and  the  dielectric  behavior  of  a  transducer.  The  piezoelectric
coefﬁcient varies with the polarization induced in the material, and may be controlled by an applied electric
ﬁeld. The electrostrictive element may be tuned from an inactive to a highly active state. The electrical impedance
of the element may be tuned by exploiting the dependence of permittivity on the biasing ﬁeld for these materials,
and the saturation of polarization under high ﬁelds [Newnham, 1990].
