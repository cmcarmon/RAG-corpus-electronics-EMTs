The history of this device is long with plenty of defeats. Invented in 1974 by Roland Moreno in France (there
were also earlier announcements: in 1968 in Germany and 1970 in Japan), it was refused any right of recognition
as a “usable invention.” These years the world was dominated successfully by a still-new fashion — plastic cards
with a magnetic stripe.
