Temperature Coefﬁcient of Electrical Resistance
The resistance for most resistors changes with temperature. The tem-
perature coefﬁcient of electrical resistance is the change in electrical
tempera-
resistance of a resistor per unit change in temperature. The

coefﬁcient  of  resistors  may  be  either  positive  or  negative. A  positive
temperature coefﬁcient denotes a rise in resistance with a rise in tem-
perature;  a  negative  temperature  coefﬁcient  of  resistance  denotes  a
decrease in resistance with a rise in temperature. Pure metals typically
have a positive temperature coefﬁcient of resistance, while some metal
alloys such as constantin and manganin have a zero temperature coef-
ﬁcient of resistance. Carbon and graphite mixed with binders usually
exhibit negative temperature coefﬁcients, although certain choices of
binders and process variations may yield positive temperature coefﬁ-
cients. The temperature coefﬁcient of resistance is given by
