In mechanics, a cylinder stress is a stress distribution with rotational symmetry; that is, which remains unchanged if the stressed object is rotated about some fixed axis.
Cylinder stress patterns include:
Circumferential stress or hoop stress, a normal stress in the tangential (azimuth) direction;
Axial stress, a normal stress parallel to the axis of cylindrical symmetry;
Radial stress, a stress in directions coplanar with but perpendicular to the symmetry axis.
The classical example (and namesake) of hoop stress is the tension applied to the iron bands, or hoops, of a wooden barrel. In a straight, closed pipe, any force applied to the cylindrical pipe wall by a pressure differential will ultimately give rise to hoop stresses. Similarly, if this pipe has flat end caps, any force applied to them by static pressure will induce a perpendicular axial stress on the same pipe wall. Thin sections often have negligibly small radial stress, but accurate models of thicker-walled cylindrical shells require such stresses to be taken into account.
