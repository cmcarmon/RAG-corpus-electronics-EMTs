Rigorous Approaches
Iterative Methods
As mentioned previously, the inverse scattering problem is in
general a nonlinear problem in the sense that the unknown
object function is nonlinearly related to the measured scattered
ﬁeld. To solve it rigorously, iterative techniques are usually
applied. Although various algorithms have been proposed,
they are based on the same principle—taking the variation of
the nonlinear equation and solving the resulting linearized
problem at each iterative step to update the solution. For
illustration, consider a dielectric object of dielectric constant
Y
distribution er (Yr) illuminated by the incident ﬁeld
Ei(Yr).
Y
Es(Yr) is related to the dielectric constant
The scattered ﬁeld
er (~rr) through equation 10.58. First discretize the object into N
small cells and assume that the dielectric constant and electric
ﬁeld are constants in each cell. By the moment method, trans-
form the integral equation 10.58 into the following algebraic
matrix equation:
