In frequency modulation, the carrier amplitude remains constant, and the output frequency of the 
transmitter is varied about the carrier (or mean) frequency at a rate corresponding to the audio 
frequencies. The extent to which the frequency changes in one direction from the unmodulated (carrier) 
frequency is called the FREQUENCY DEVIATION.
