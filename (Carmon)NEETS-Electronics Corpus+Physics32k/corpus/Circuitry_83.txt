Series  and  parallel  combinations  of 
resistors 
 
In  order  to  obtain  a  particular  value  of  resistance, 
fixed  resistors  may  be  arranged  in  either  series  or 
parallel as shown in Figs 2.10 and 2.11. 
  The  effective  resistance  of  each  of  the  series 
circuits  shown  in  Fig.  2.10  is  simply  equal  to  the 
sum of the individual resistances. So, for the circuit 
shown in Fig. 2.10(a): 
 
R = R1 + R2
while for Fig. 2.10(b) 
 
R = R1 + R2 + R3
Turning to the parallel resistors shown in Fig. 2.11, 
the  reciprocal  of  the  effective  resistance  of  each 
circuit is equal to the sum of the reciprocals of the 
individual resistances. Hence, for Fig. 2.11(a):
