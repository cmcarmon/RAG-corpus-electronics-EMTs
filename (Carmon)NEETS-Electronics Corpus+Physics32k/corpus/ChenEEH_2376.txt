The second line presented in Table 5.4 is made out of two
wires (signal-ground) running parallel to each other. The
diameter of the conductor is indicated with d and the sepa-
ration with s. There are several variations of this simple trans-
mission line, among them the most common is called ‘twisted
pair’, and it consists of two wires twisted with each other,
forming a helix.
