In voltage regulation studies, it is customary to express the
primary feeder voltage values in a 120-V base. The voltage-
regulating relay (VRR) of a voltage regulator is adjustable
within the approximate range from 110 to 125 V. The VRR
measures the voltage at the regulating point by means of LDC.
The LDC has R and X settings that are both adjustable within
the approximate range from 0 to 24 V (often called volts
because the current transformers used with regulators have
1-A secondaries). The bandwidth (BW) of the VRR is adjust-
able within the approximate range from 0.75 to 1.5 V based
on 120 V. The time delay is adjustable between about 10 and
120 sec. The location of the regulating point is controlled by
the R and X settings of the LDC. If the R and X settings are set
at zero, the regulator adjusts the voltage at its local terminal to
the setting of the VRR  BW. Good advantage sometimes can
be taken of this designed ‘‘overload’’ type of limited-range
operation. If
load growth occurs, however, both a larger
range of regulation and larger regulator size may be required.
The peak-load voltage proﬁle is not in linear but in para-
bolic shape. The voltage-drop value for any given point s bet-
ween the substation and the regulator station can be found
