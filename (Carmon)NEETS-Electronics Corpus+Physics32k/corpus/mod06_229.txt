During the next cycle, the same process will be repeated, with Cc charging on the positive alternation
and discharging a lesser amount during the negative alternation. Therefore, at the end of the second cycle,
Cc will have an even larger negative charge than it did after the first cycle. You might think that the
charge on Cc will continue to increase until the tube is forced into cutoff. This is not the case. As the
negative charge on the right-hand plate of Cc forces the grid more negative, electrostatic attraction
between the grid and cathode decreases. This, in effect, increases the resistance (rgk) between the cathode
and the grid, until rgk becomes, in effect, the same size as Rg. At this point, charge and discharge of Cc
will equal one another and the grid will remain at some negative, steady voltage. What has happened in
this circuit is that Cc and Rg, through the use of unequal charge and discharge paths, have acted to change
the ac input to a negative dc voltage. The extent of the bias on the grid will depend on three things: the
amplitude of the input, the frequency of the input, and the size of Rg and Cc. This type of biasing has the
advantage of being directly related to the amplitude of the input signal. If the amplitude increases, biasing
increases in step with it. The main limiting factor is the amount of distortion that you may be willing to
tolerate. Distortion occurs during the positive alternation when the grid draws current. Current drawn
from the electron stream by the grid never reaches the plate; therefore the negative-going output is not a
faithful reproduction of the input, while the positive-going output (during the negative input cycle) will be
a faithful reproduction of the input. This is similar to the situation shown in the flattopped portion of the
output signal in figure 1-20.
