Under Hugo Ch√°vez and his Bolivarian Revolution, Venezuela moved toward authoritarian socialism. The Bolivarian government used "[c]entralized decision-making and a top-down approach to policy formation, the erosion of vertical power-sharing and concentration of power in the presidency, the progressive deinstitutionalization at all levels, and an increasingly paternalist relationship between state and society" in order to hasten changes in Venezuela.
