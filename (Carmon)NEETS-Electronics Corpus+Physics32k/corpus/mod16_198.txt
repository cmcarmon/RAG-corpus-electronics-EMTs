In chapter 1, you studied test equipment administration and the basic measurements that all
technicians are responsible for performing. Chapter 2 presents miscellaneous measurements that are fairly
common; keep in mind, however, that you may not routinely perform these measurements in your
particular job. This chapter introduces you to several test instruments and components found in those test
instruments. It will also serve as a review of some of the basics of electronic theory related to test
equipment.
