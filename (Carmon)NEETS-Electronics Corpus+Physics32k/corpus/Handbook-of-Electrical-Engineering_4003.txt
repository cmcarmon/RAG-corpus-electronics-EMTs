FIGURE 39.13 Cross-sectional  view  of  a  microwave  MESFET.  The  cross-hatched  areas  indicate  metal  electrodes  placed
upon the semiconductor to provide for electrical connections. The areas indicated as n+ are highly doped, highly conducting
regions  to  reduce  ohmic  access  resistances.  The  channel  contains  the  region  of  current  ﬂow  and  the  substrate  is  highly
resistive and nonconducting so that the current ﬂow is conﬁned to the channel.
