The loop ﬁlter is used to shape the overall response of the PLL to meet the design goals of the system. There
are  two  implementations  of  the  loop  ﬁlter  that  are  used  in  the  vast  majority  of  PLLs:  the  passive  lag  circuit
shown  in  Fig.  76.2  and  the  active  circuit  shown  in  Fig.  76.3.  These  two  circuits  both  produce  a  PLL  with  a
second-order response characteristic.
