The power reserve indicator is one of the most useful features of a mechanical watch besides the actual time display. A mechanical watch is operated either by automatic- or manual winding. In order to run at a regular rate a mechanical timepiece needs to have at least 30 per cent of its mainspring wound. An automatic timepiece needs to be worn for about 10â€“15 hours before it is fully wound.
The power reserve indicator displayed on the watch with automatic- winding movement shows how long a watch will function when not worn. On a manual winding watch, it shows the time left until the watch needs winding.
