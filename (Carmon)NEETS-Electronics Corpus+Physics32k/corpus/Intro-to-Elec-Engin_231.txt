Power and Power Factor in ac Circuits
Power is the rate of change of energy with respect to time. The unit of power is a watt (W),
which is a joule per second (J/s). The use of rms or effective values of voltage and current allows
an impedance Z(cid:2) φ = R + j X excited by an applied voltage of v(t ) = √
the average power to be found from phasor quantities. Let us consider a circuit consisting of
2 Vrmscos (ωt + φ),
producing a current of i(t ) = √
2 Irmscosωt. The corresponding voltage and current phasors are
then given by V (cid:2) φandI(cid:2) 0°, which satisfy the Ohm’s-law relation ¯V / ¯I = V (cid:2) φ/I(cid:2) 0° = Z(cid:2) φ.
