applications where the operating temperature falls 
between 32°F and 158°F (0°C and 70°C). Ceramic 
devices are more expensive but offer better protec-
tion against moisture and contamination. They also 
operate in a wider range of temperatures of 267°F 
to 2193°F (255°C to 1125°C). Ceramic devices are 
 recommended for military, aerospace, and severe 
 industrial applications.
