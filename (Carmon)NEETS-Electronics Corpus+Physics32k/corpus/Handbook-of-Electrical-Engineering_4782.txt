The  measurement  of  the  dielectric  constant  and  the  losses  is  usually  very  straightforward.  A  slab  with  a
circular or other well-deÔ¨Åned cross section is prepared, electrodes are applied, and the capacity and loss are
measured (usually as a function of frequency). The dielectric constant is found from
