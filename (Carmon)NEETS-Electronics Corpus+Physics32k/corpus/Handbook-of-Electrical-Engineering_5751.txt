4. It can assess the cure for instability for contingencies that do not have a solution. The cure can be either
(1)  adding  needed  reactive  reserve  on  speciﬁc  generators  to  obtain  a  solution  that  is  voltage  stable,
(2) adding reactive supply resources needed in one or more agents, or (3) the reduction in generation
and load in one or more agents or between one or more agents to obtain a solution and assure that it
is  a  stable  solution.  These  cures  can  be  obtained  in  an  automated  fashion  [Schlueter,  1998b; f].  The
diagnosis can also indicate if the lack of a solution is due to convergence difﬁculties or round-off error
if  the  diagnosis  indicates  the  contingency  combination  does  not  produce  sufﬁcient  network  reactive
losses to cause instability or any agent.
