where {~cc} denotes an approximate solution. Commonly used
iterative methods include the conjugate gradient (Hestenes
and Stiefel, 1952), the biconjugate gradient (Fletcher, 1975),
the quasiminimal residual (Freund and Nachtigal, 1991),
the generalized minimal residual (Saad, 1986), and their
variations, such as the conjugate gradient stabilized (Sonne-
veld, 1989), the conjugate gradient normal residual (Green-
baum, 1997), the biconjugate gradient stabilized (van der
Vorst, 1992), and the transpose-free quasiminimal residual
(Freund, 1993). The algorithms implementing these methods
can be found in public literature and software packages of
Barret (1993) and Saad (1995). For positive deﬁnite systems,
the conjugate gradient method is the optimum iterative solver.
For indeﬁnite systems, such as most matrix equations for elec-
tromagnetic problems, it is not clear which is optimum. An
iterative solver calculates one or two matrix-vector products for
each iteration. Hence, it requires O(N 2) operations per iter-
ation, and the total computing time is proportional to NiterN 2,
where Niter denotes the total number of iterations for conver-
gence. If Niter is small, an iterative solver can be faster than the
LU decomposition method for one right-hand side. The intera-
tive solver, however, must repeat the process for every new
right-hand side.
