a gap which is changing in length is given by 
small compared to the surface area of the capacitor, since most dielectric constants are of the order of 1 
farads/cm and with present methods, capacitance is readily resolvable to only about 10
 farads. This is because
measurement leads and contacts create parasitic capacitances the same order of magnitude. If the capacitance
 farads
is measured at the generated site by an integrated circuit (see Section III), capacitances as small as 10
