In 1901 the third General Conference on Weights and Measures defined a standard gravitational acceleration for the surface of the Earth: gn = 9.80665 m/s2. The larger variations described below were not yet known. Therefore this definition is not a value of any particular place or carefully worked out average, but an agreement for a value to use if a better actual local value is not known or not important.
