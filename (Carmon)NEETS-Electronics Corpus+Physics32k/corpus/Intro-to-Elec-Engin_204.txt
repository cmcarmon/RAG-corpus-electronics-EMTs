*2.6.2 An interface circuit consisting of R1 and R2 is
designed between the source and the load, as il-
lustrated in Figure P2.6.2 such that the load sees
a Th´evenin resistance of 50  between terminals
C and D, while simultaneously the source sees a
load resistance of 300  between A and B. Using
MATLAB, ﬁnd R1, and R2.
Hint: solve the two nonlinear equations given by
(R1 + 300)R2
= 300
R1 + 300 + R2
