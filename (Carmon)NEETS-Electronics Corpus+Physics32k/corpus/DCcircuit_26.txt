Some experimenters speculated that invisible ”ﬂuids” were being transferred from one ob-
ject to another during the process of rubbing, and that these ”ﬂuids” were able to effect a
physical force over a distance. Charles Dufay was one of the early experimenters who demon-
strated that there were deﬁnitely two different types of changes wrought by rubbing certain
pairs of objects together. The fact that there was more than one type of change manifested in
these materials was evident by the fact that there were two types of forces produced: attraction
and repulsion. The hypothetical ﬂuid transfer became known as a charge.
