The voltage output increases as the load circuit starts drawing more current. Under low-load current 
conditions, the current that flows in the load and through the generator is small. Since small current 
means that a small magnetic field is set up by the field poles, only a small voltage is induced in the 
armature. If the resistance of the load decreases, the load current increases. Under this condition, more 
current flows through the field. This increases the magnetic field and increases the output voltage. A 
series-wound dc generator has the characteristic that the output voltage varies with load current. This is 
undesirable in most applications. For this reason, this type of generator is rarely used in everyday 
practice.
