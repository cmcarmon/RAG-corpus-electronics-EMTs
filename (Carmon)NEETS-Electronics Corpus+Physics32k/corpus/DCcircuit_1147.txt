Almost all conductors possess a certain, measurable resistance (special types of materials
called superconductors possess absolutely no electrical resistance, but these are not ordinary
materials, and they must be held in special conditions in order to be super conductive). Typ-
ically, we assume the resistance of the conductors in a circuit to be zero, and we expect that
current passes through them without producing any appreciable voltage drop. In reality, how-
ever, there will almost always be a voltage drop along the (normal) conductive pathways of an
electric circuit, whether we want a voltage drop to be there or not:
