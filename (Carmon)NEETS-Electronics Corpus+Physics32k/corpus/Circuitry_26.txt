positive  proton  experience  a  force  of  mutual 
attraction. 
  The outer shell electrons of a conductor  can be 
reasonably  easily  interchanged  between  adjacent 
atoms  within  the  lattice  of  atoms  of  which  the 
substance is composed. This  makes it possible  for 
the  material 
to  conduct  electricity.  Typical  
examples of conductors are metals such as copper, 
silver,  iron  and  aluminium.  By  contrast,  the  outer 
shell electrons of an insulator  are firmly bound to 
their  parent  atoms  and  virtually  no  interchange  of 
is  possible.  Typical  examples  of  
electrons 
insulators  are  plastics, 
rubber  and  ceramic 
materials.
