Luminance and Luminance Ratios. The ability to see details depends on the contrast between the detail and
its background. The greater the contrast difference in luminance, the more readily the seeing task is performed.
The eye functions most comfortably and efﬁciently when the luminance within the remainder of the environ-
ment is relatively uniform. In manufacturing, there are many areas where it is not practical to achieve the same
luminance  relationships  as  easily  as  in  ofﬁces.  Table  107.7  is  shown  as  a  practical  guide  to  recommended
maximum  luminance  ratios  for  industrial  areas.  To  achieve  the  recommended  luminance  relationships,  it  is
necessary to select the reﬂectances of all the ﬁnishes of the room surfaces and equipment as well as control of
the luminance distribution of the lighting equipment. Table 107.8 lists the recommended reﬂectance values for
industrial interiors and equipment. High-reﬂectance surfaces are desirable to provide the recommended lumi-
nance relationships and high utilization of light.
