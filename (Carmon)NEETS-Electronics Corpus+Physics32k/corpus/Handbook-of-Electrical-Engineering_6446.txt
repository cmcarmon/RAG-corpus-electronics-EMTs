The frequency spacing between the FH/MFSK tones is governed by the chip rate Rc and is, thus, dependent
on  whether  the  FH  modulation  is  FFH  or  SFH.  In  particular,  for  SFH  where  Rc  =  Rs,  the  spacing  between
FH/MFSK tones is equal to the spacing between the MFSK tones themselves. For noncoherent detection (the
most commonly encountered in FH/MFSK systems), the separation of the MFSK symbols necessary to provide
orthogonality3 is an integer multiple of Rs. Assuming the minimum spacing, i.e., Rs, the entire spread spectrum
band is then partitioned into a total of Nt = Wss/Rs=Wss /Rc equally spaced FH tones. One arrangement, which
is by far the most common, is to group these Nt tones into Nb = Nt/M contiguous, nonoverlapping bands, each
with bandwidth M Rs = M Rc; see Fig. 70.16(a). Assuming symmetric MFSK modulation around the carrier
frequency, then the center frequencies of the Nb = 2k bands represent the set of hop carriers, each of which is
assigned to a given k-tuple of the PN code generator. In this ﬁxed arrangement, each of the Nt FH/MFSK tones
corresponds to the combination of a unique hop carrier (PN code k-tuple) and a unique MFSK symbol. Another
arrangement,  which  provides  more  protection  against  the  sophisticated  interferer  (jammer),  is  to  overlap
adjacent M -ary bands by an amount equal to Rc; see Fig. 70.16(b). Assuming again that the center frequency
of each band corresponds to a possible hop carrier, then since all but  M – 1 of the Nt tones are available as
center frequencies, the number of hop carriers has been increased from Nt/M to Nt – (M – 1), which for Nt @
M is approximately an increase in randomness by a factor of M.
