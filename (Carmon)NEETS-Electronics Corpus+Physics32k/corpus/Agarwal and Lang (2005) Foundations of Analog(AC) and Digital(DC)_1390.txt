If the time constant is a substantial fraction of the pulse length, then the
solution appears as waveform c in Figure 10.8. Note that the drawing implies
that the transients still go almost to completion, so there is an upper limit on
the RC product for this solution to apply. Assuming, as noted here, that simple
transients are complete for times greater than five time constants, the RC prod-
uct must be less than one-fifth of the pulse length, or one tenth the square-wave
period for this solution to apply.
