At the Equator, the daytime period always lasts almost twelve hours in length, no matter what the season. The Sun always rises nearly perpendicular to the horizon. From the March Equinox to the September Equinox, it rises a bit north of east, and sets a bit north of west. From the September Equinox to the March Equinox, it rises a bit south of east and sets a bit south of west. The path of the Sun lies entirely in the northern half of the sky for the period from the March Equinox to the September Equinox and is entirely in the southern half of the sky from the September Equinox to the March Equinox, with the Sun passing directly overhead at noon on the equinoxes.
The fact that the Sun is always so close to the vertical at noon on the Equator (never being more than 23.5Â° north or south) explains why equatorial regions are the hottest regions on the planet overall. Additionally, sunrise and sunset always occur very quickly at the Equator, because the Sun's path across the sky is so nearly vertical with respect to the horizon; at the equinox, the Sun requires only two minutes to traverse the horizon at sunrise and sunsets.
