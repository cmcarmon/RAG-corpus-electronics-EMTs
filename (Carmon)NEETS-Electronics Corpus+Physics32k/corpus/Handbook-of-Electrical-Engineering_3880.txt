where L = nd corresponds to the physical dimension (length) of the aperture of oscillators. The zeros of this
function occur at kL sinq  = 2mp, for any nonzero integer m. Equivalently, the zeros occur when sinq  =  ml/L.
When  the  element  spacing  d  is  less  than  a  wavelength,  the  number  of  zeros  for  0  < q  <  p/2  is  given  by  the
largest integer M such that M £  L/l. Therefore, the ratio of wavelength to largest dimension,  l/L, determines
both the location (in q space) and the number of zeros in the intensity pattern when d £  l. The number of
oscillators controls the amplitude of the side lobes.
