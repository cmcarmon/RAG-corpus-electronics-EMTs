These results mean that it is possible to transmit digital information over a noisy channel (one that in-
troduces errors) and receive the information without error if the code is suﬃciently ineﬃcient compared
to the channel’s characteristics. Generally, a channel’s capacity changes with the signal-to-noise ratio: As
one increases or decreases, so does the other. The capacity measures the overall error characteristics of a
channel—the smaller the capacity the more frequently errors occur—and an overly eﬃcient error-correcting
code will not build in enough error correction capability to counteract channel errors.
