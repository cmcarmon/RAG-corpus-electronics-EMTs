WAVINESSâ€”(1) A non-flat head's top surface perpendicular to the tape motion due to different
wear rates in top surface materials. The harder material will be up. The head core is usually
the harder material; therefore, there will be increased head-to-tape contact pressure at the
cost of tape life. (2) Can occur during break-in or field use.
