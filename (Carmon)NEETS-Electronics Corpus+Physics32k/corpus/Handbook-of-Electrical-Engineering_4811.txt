Electrostriction is not a simple phenomenon but manifests itself as three thermodynamically related effects
[Sundar  and  Newnham,  1992].  The  ﬁrst  is  the  well-known  variation  of  strain  with  polarization,  called  the

Piezoelectricity and Electrostriction
Piezoelectricity is a third-rank tensor property found only in acentric materials and is absent in most materials.
The noncentrosymmetric point groups generally exhibit piezoelectric effects that are larger than the electro-
