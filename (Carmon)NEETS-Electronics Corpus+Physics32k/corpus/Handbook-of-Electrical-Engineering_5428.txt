Shunt Admittance
The  shunt  admittance  consists  of  the  conductance  and  the  capacitive  susceptance.  The  conductance  of  a
transmission line is usually very small and is neglected in steady-state studies. A capacitance matrix related to
phase voltages and charges of a three-phase transmission line is
