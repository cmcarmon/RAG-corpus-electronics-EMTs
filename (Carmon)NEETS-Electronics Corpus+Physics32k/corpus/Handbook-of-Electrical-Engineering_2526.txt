The  ways  in  which  the  small-signal  quantities  ﬂuctuate  may  now  be  examined.  If  vbe  goes  positive,  this
actually means that VBE increases a little. This in turn implies that IC increases by an amount ic , so the voltage
drop in RC increases by vce. Keeping in mind that the top of RC is held at a constant voltage, this means that
the voltage at the bottom of RC must fall by vce. This very important point shows that because vce falls as vbe
rises, there is 180(cid:176) phase shift through the stage. That is, the CE stage is an inverting voltage ampliﬁer. However,
because ic increases into the collector as ib increases into the base, it is also a noninverting current ampliﬁer.
