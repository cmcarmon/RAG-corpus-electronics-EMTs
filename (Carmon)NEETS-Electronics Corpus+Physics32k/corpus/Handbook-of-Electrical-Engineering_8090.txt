Semiconductor Materials
Silicon is the most common material used in current semiconductor technologies, but it is not at all suitable
for an LED. The reason is that silicon has an indirect bandgap, and a direct bandgap is required for process
efÔ¨Åciency.  Direct  and  indirect  bandgaps  are  compared  in  Fig. 83.2,  where  carrier  energy  is  plotted  versus
momentum for both cases. The photon momentum
