Approximate Analytical Expression
Y. Liu (1996) has shown that, to determine the relative velocity
anisotropy characteristic intrinsic to a space grid, it is useful to
set up an eigenvalue problem for the matrix that delineates the
spatial derivatives used in the numerical algorithm. Consider
as an example the case of two-dimensional FDTD modeling of
electromagnetic wave propagation. Following the development
in Taﬂove and Hagness (2000), it can be shown that Y. Liu’s
(1996) technique leads to a simple approximate analytical
expression for D~vvaniso that is useful for Nl > 10:
