In thick-film	integrated	circuits construction, 
the resistors, capacitors, and conductors are formed on 
the substrate using a screen-printing process: A fine 
wire screen is placed over the substrate, and metallized 
ink is forced through the screen with a squeegee. The 
screen acts as a mask. The substrate and ink are then 
heated to over 1112°F (600°C) to harden the ink.
