Getting a charge out of protons and electrons
Electric charge is a property of certain particles, such as electrons, protons, 
and quarks (yes, quarks) that describes how they interact with each other. 
There are two different types of electric charge, somewhat arbitrarily named 
positive and negative (much like the four cardinal directions are named 
north, south, east, and west). In general, particles carrying the same type of 
charge repel each other, whereas particles carrying opposite charges attract 
each other. Within each atom, the protons inside the nucleus attract the 
 electrons that are outside the nucleus.
