Figure 2-24 shows the common-emitter configuration of the Pierce oscillator. The resistors in the 
circuit provide the proper bias and stabilization conditions. The crystal unit and capacitors C1 and C2 
determine the output frequency of the oscillator. The signal developed at the junction between Y1 and C1 
is 180 degrees out of phase with the signal at the junction between Y1 and C2. Therefore, the signal at the 
Y1-C1 junction can be coupled back to the base of Q1 as a regenerative feedback signal to sustain 
oscillations.
