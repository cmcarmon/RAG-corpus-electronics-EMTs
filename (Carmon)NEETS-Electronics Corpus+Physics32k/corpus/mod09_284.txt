When current first starts to flow through coil L1, the bottom of L1 is negative with respect to the top 
of L2. The voltage induced into coil L2 makes the top of L2 positive. As the top of L2 becomes positive, 
the positive potential is coupled to the base of Q1 by capacitor C1. A positive potential on the base results 
in an increase of the forward bias of Q1 and causes collector current to increase. The increased collector 
current also increases the emitter current flowing through coil L1. Increased current through L1 results in 
more energy being supplied to the tank circuit, which, in turn, increases the positive potential at the top of 
the tank (L2) and increases the forward bias of Q1. This action continues until the rate of current change 
through coil L1 can no longer increase. The current through coil L1 and the transistor cannot continue 
increasing indefinitely, or the coil and transistor will burn up. The circuit must be designed, by proper 
selection of the transistor and associated parts, so that some point is reached when the current can no 
longer continue to increase. At this point C2 has charged to the potential across L1 and L2. This is shown 
as the heavy dot on the base waveform. As the current through L1 decreases, the voltage induced in L2 
decreases. The positive potential across the tank begins to decrease and C2 starts discharging through L1 
and L2. This action maintains current flow through the tapped coil and causes a decrease in the forward 
bias of Q1. In turn, this decrease in the forward bias of Q1 causes the collector and emitter current to 
decrease. At the instant the potential across the tank circuit decreases to 0, the energy of the tank circuit is 
contained in the magnetic field of the coil. The oscillator has completed a half cycle of operation.
