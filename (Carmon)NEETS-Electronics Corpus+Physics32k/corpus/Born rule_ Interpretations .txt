Within the Quantum Bayesianism interpretation of quantum theory, the Born rule is seen as an extension of the standard Law of Total Probability, which takes into account the Hilbert space dimension of the physical system involved.  In the ambit of the so-called Hidden-Measurements Interpretation of quantum mechanics the Born rule can be derived by averaging over all possible measurement-interactions that can take place between the quantum entity and the measuring system.  It has been claimed that Pilot Wave Theory can also statistically derive Born's law.  While it has been claimed that Born's law can be derived from the Many Worlds Interpretation, the existing proofs have been criticized as circular.
