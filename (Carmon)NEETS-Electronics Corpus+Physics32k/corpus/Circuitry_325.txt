Procedure 
 
Connect  the  simple  zener  diode  shunt  regulator 
shown  in  Fig.  6.32.  Set  the  variable  resistor  to 
produce a load current (IL) of 10 mA then measure 
and  record  the  output  voltage  produced  across  the 
load,  VL. Repeat  for  load  currents  from  20  mA  to 
100 mA in 10 mA steps.  
  Connect  the  transistor  regulator  shown  in  Fig. 
6.33.  Set  the  variable  resistor  to  produce  a  load 
current (IL) of 25 mA then measure and record the 
output voltage produced across the load, VL. Repeat 
for load current from 50 mA to 250 mA in 25 mA 
steps.
