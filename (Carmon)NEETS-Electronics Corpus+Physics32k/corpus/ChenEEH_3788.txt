The grammar of a language is, in principle, arbitrary in the
sense that any rule for combining symbols may be posed. On
the other hand, semantics is concerned with the way in which
symbols are combined to form meaningful communication.
Systems imbued with semantic knowledge sources straddle the
line between speech recognition and speech understanding and
draw heavily on artiÔ¨Åcial intelligence research. Beyond binary
unmeaningful or meaningful decisions about symbol strings,
semantic processors can be used to impose meaning upon
incomplete, ambiguous, noisy, or otherwise hard-to-under-
stand speech.
