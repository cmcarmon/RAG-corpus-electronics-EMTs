A trivalent (acceptor) impurity element can also be used to dope germanium. In this case, the
impurity is 1 electron short of the required amount of electrons needed to establish covalent bonds with 4
neighboring atoms. Thus, in a single covalent bond, there will be only 1 electron instead of 2. This
arrangement leaves a hole in that covalent bond. Figure 1-11 illustrates this theory by showing what
happens when germanium is doped with an indium (In) atom. Notice, the indium atom in the figure is 1
