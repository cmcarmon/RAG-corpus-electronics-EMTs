A capacitor is a two‐terminal electronic 
device that stores electrical energy 
transferred from a voltage source.  
(See Figure 7‐1.) If you remove the volt-
age source and electrically isolate the 
capacitor (so that it isn’t connected in 
a complete circuit), it holds onto the 
stored electrical energy. If you connect 
it to other components in a complete 
circuit, it will release some or all of the 
stored energy. A capacitor is made from 
two metal plates separated by an insula-
tor, which is known as a dielectric.
