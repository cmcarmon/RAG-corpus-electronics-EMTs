An optical source converts electrical energy (current) into optical energy (light). Light emitted by an
optical source is launched, or coupled, into an optical fiber for transmission. Fiber optic data link
performance depends on the amount of optical power (light) launched into the optical fiber. This chapter
attempts to provide an understanding of light-generating mechanisms within the main types of optical
sources used in fiber optics.
