Detection with Continuous-Time Measurements
Note that all of the preceding formulations have involved the assumption of discrete-time (i.e., sampled-data)
measurements. From a practical point of view, this is the most natural framework within which to consider
these problems, since implementations most often involve digital hardware. However, the procedures discussed
in  this  section  all  have  continuous-time  counterparts,  which  are  of  both  theoretical  and  practical  interest.
Mathematically, continuous-time detection problems are more difÔ¨Åcult than discrete-time ones, because they
involve probabilistic analysis on function spaces. The theory of such problems is quite elegant, and the interested
reader is referred to Poor [1994] or Grenander [1981] for more detailed exposition.
