The Hele-Shaw clutch was also used for extremely high powers in both industry and for marine propulsion, of 1,000 hp and more.
When combined with an epicyclic gearbox, a pair of clutches could form a reversing gearbox. Engaging each clutch in turn provided a forwards and reverse motion, one direction being geared down in speed and increased in torque. As the clutches could be engaged quickly with only a light controlling force, these gearboxes became widely used in heavy steel rolling mills, where the rollers are driven forwards requiring full power, then quickly in reverse.
