The thermal trip element circuit breaker, like a delay fuse, will protect a circuit against a small
overload that continues for a long time. The larger the overload, the faster the circuit breaker will trip.
The thermal element will also protect the circuit against temperature increases. A magnetic circuit breaker
will trip instantly when the preset current is present. In some applications, both types of protection are
desired. Rather than use two separate circuit breakers, a single trip element combining thermal and
magnetic trip elements is used. A thermal-magnetic trip element is shown in figure 2-21.
