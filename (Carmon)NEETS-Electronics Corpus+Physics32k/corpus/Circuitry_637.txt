Continuing with our optical analogy, in order to 
further  concentrate  the  light  energy  into  a  narrow 
beam we can add a lens in front of the lamp. This 
will have the effect of bending  the  light emerging 
from the lamp towards the normal line. In order to 
achieve  the  same  effect  in  our  aerial  system  we 
need  to  place  a  conducting  element,  known  as  a 
director, on the other side of the dipole and about 
one  quarter  of  a  wavelength  from  it.  Once  again, 
this element is parasitic but in this case it needs to 
be  cut  slightly  shorter  than  the  driven  dipole 
element. The resulting directional pattern will now 
have a narrower major lobe as the energy becomes 
concentrated  in  the  normal  direction  (i.e.  at  right 
angles to the dipole elements).
