Like silicon, germanium has four electrons in its 
valence shell and can form a crystalline  structure. 
 Germanium’s resistance is cut in half for  every 10  degrees 
Celsius of temperature rise. Thus  germanium appears to 
be more stable with respect to temperature change than 
silicon. However,  germanium requires less heat energy 
to dislodge its electrons than does silicon. Silicon has 
a thousand times more resistance than germanium at 
room temperature.
