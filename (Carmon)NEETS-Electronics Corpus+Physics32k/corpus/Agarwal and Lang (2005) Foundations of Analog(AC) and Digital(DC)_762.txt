We can also use the equalities to simplify expressions into their respective
minimal forms. A commonly used form is called the minimum sum-of-products
form. For example, A+ A+ AC+ D is a valid sum-of-products representation.
Since A + A = A, and A + AC = A + C, its minimum sum-of-products form
is simply A + C + D.
It turns out that the expression in our previous example A C D + B C D
