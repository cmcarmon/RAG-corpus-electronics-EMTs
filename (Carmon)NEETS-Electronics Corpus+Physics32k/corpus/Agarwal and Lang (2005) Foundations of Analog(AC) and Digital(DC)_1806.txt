Unfortunately, our list does not include the maximum amplitude of the envelope
that governs the decay of the sinusoid, a parameter that when combined with
the rate of decay Î± would add even more accuracy to our sketch. Although we
can determine this value, it adds significant complexity of our analysis, and so
we will not attempt to solve for the general form. It turns out, however, that
the maximum amplitude can be calculated much more easily when an initial
state and a driving voltage are not both present. We will work out the following
example to illustrate this fact.
