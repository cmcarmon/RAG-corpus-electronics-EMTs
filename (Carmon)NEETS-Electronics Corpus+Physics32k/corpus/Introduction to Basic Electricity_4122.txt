The prefix mono- means “one.” A monostable mul-
tivibrator has only one stable state. It is also called 
a one-shot multivibrator because it produces one 
output pulse for each input pulse. The output pulse is 
generally longer than the input pulse. Therefore, this 
circuit is also called a pulse stretcher. Typically, the cir-
cuit is used as a gate in computers, electronic control 
circuits, and communication equipment.
