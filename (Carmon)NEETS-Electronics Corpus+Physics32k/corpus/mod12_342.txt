When discussing power in a pulse-modulation system, we have to consider PEAK POWER and
AVERAGE POWER. Peak power is the maximum value of the transmitted pulse; average power is the
peak power value averaged over the pulse-repetition time. Peak power is very easy to see in a pulse
system. In figure 2-37, all pulsed wave shapes have a peak power of 100 watts. Also note that in views
(A), (B), and (C) the pulse width is the same, even though the carrier frequency is different. In these three
cases average power would be the same. This is because average power is actually equal to the peak
power of a pulse averaged over 1 operating cycle. However, the pulse width is increased in view (D) and
we have a greater average power with the same prt. In view (E) the decreased pulse width has decreased
average power over the same prt.
