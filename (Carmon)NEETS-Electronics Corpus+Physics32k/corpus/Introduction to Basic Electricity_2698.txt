The current increases with an increase in voltage 
or a decrease in the inductive reactance. Likewise, 
 decreasing the voltage or increasing the inductive 
 reactance causes a decrease in current.
EXAMPLE:	 How much current flows through a 
250-millihenry inductor when a signal of 12 volts and 
60 hertz is applied across it?
