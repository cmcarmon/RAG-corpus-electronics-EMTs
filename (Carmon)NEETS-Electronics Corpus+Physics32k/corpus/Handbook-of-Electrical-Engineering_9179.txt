Applications are also confronted with the Internet challenge. Security systems are facing new offensives and
new security schemes that must be put in place. The Internet not only broadcasts the information at the speed
of light; it represents to hackers a tremendous power for parallel computing. Competitions are organized on
the net to break encryption keys: each participant downloads the required software and adds its contribution
to the computing effort. Key size is lengthened, consequently. Secure transactions over the net also bring new
problems. Applications are distributed, client-server schemes become more important, the number of trans-
actions are growing and, consequentially, we do not know who is on the other side. For an electronic wallet
application, this is crucial because nobody wants to give his credit card number without some credentials. Third
party certiﬁcates are there to authenticate your invisible partner and mechanisms are set to establish a conﬁdence
path between all involved parties of a transaction.
