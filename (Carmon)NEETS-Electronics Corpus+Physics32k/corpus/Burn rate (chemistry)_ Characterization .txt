A substance is characterized through burn rate vs pressure chart and burn rate vs temperature chart.
Higher burn rate than the speed of sound in the material (usually several km/s): "detonation"
A few meters per second: "deflagration"
A few centimeters per second: "burn" or "smolder"
0.01 mm/s to 100 mm/s: "decomposing rapidly" to characterize it.
However, there is difference in opinion in differentiating the three in absence of firm numbers at given pressure or temperature.
