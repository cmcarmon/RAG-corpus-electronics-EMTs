marked C, NO, and NC. These letters stand for common, normally open, and normally closed. The
common terminal is connected to the normally closed terminal until the plunger is depressed. When the
plunger is depressed, the spring will "snap" into the momentary position and the common terminal will be
connected to the normally open terminal. As soon as the plunger is released, the spring will "snap" back
to the original condition.
