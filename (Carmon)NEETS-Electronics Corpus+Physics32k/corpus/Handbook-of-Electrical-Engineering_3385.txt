Several types of sensors using integrated optic devices have been demonstrated. Two of the most promising
are  electric/magnetic  ﬁeld  or  voltage  sensors  and  rotation  sensors  (ﬁber  optic  gyro).  Electric  ﬁeld  sensors
typically  consist  of  either  a  Mach–Zehnder  intensity  modulator  or  an  optical  switch  that  is  biased  midway
between the on and off states. For small modulation depths about this midpoint the induced optical modulation
is  linear  with  respect  to  applied  voltage.  Linear  dynamic  ranges  in  excess  of  80  dB  have  been  accomplished.
This is larger than that obtained using any other known technology.
