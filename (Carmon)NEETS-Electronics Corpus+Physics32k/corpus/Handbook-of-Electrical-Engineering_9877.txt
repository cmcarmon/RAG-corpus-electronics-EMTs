Over the range of frequency where *GMc(jw)* >> 1, such that the corrected loop gain is large, the attenuation
of a load disturbance is proportional to the uncorrected loop gain. This is generally larger over a wider frequency
range  than  the  corrected  loop  gain  magnitude  *GMc(jw)*,  which  is  what  the  attenuation  would  be  if  series
compensation were used.
