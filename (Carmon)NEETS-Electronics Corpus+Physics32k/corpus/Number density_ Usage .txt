Using the number density as a function of spatial coordinates, the total number of objects N in the entire volume V can be calculated as




N
=

∭

V


n
(
x
,

y
,

z
)


d

V
,


{\displaystyle N=\iiint _{V}n(x,\,y,\,z)\,\mathrm {d} V,}

where dV = dx dy dz is a volume element. If each object possesses the same mass m0, the total mass m of all the objects in the volume V can be expressed as




m
=

∭

V



m

0


n
(
x
,

y
,

z
)


d

V
.


{\displaystyle m=\iiint _{V}m_{0}n(x,\,y,\,z)\,\mathrm {d} V.}

Similar expressions are valid for electric charge or any other extensive quantity associated with countable objects. For example, replacing m with q (total charge) and m0 with q0 (charge of each object) in the above equation will lead to a correct expression for charge.
The number density of solute molecules in a solvent is sometimes called concentration, although usually concentration is expressed as a number of moles per unit volume (and thus called molar concentration).
