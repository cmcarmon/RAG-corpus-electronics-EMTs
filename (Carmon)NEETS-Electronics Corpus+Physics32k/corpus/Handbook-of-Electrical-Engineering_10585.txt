Veiling Reﬂections.  Figure 107.4 shows that light would reﬂect into the
eyes  of  the  viewer  from  the  “offending  zone”  and  deﬁnes  the  zone  of
veiling  reﬂection.  Veiling  reﬂection  would  diminish  visibility,  but  the
viewer would be unaware of it. The contrast rendition factor (CRF) can
be applied as a measure of the amount of veiling reﬂection.
