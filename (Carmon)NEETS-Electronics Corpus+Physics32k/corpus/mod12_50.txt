When an alternating waveform is generated, the coil is represented by a vector which has a length 
that is equal to the maximum output voltage (Emax). The output voltage at any given angle can be found by 
applying the above trigonometric function. Because the output voltage is in direct relationship with the 
sine of the angle !, it is commonly called a sine wave.
