A SAW ﬁlter is composed of two cascaded transducers. In addition, the overall ﬁlter function is the product of
two  acoustic  transfer  functions,  two  electrical  transfer  functions,  and  a  delay  line  function,  as  illustrated  in
Fig. 47.6.  The  acoustic  ﬁlter  functions  are  as  designed  by  each  SAW  transducer.  The  delay  line  function  is
dependent on several parameters, the most important being frequency and transducer separation. The propa-
gation  path  transfer  function,  D(w),  is  normally  assumed  unity,  although  this  may  not  be  true  for  high
frequencies ( f >  500 MHz)  or  if  there  are  ﬁlms  in  the  propagation  path.  The  electrical  networks  may  cause
distortion of the acoustic response and are typically compensated in the initial SAW transducer’s design.
