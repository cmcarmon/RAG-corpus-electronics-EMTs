Superwinds are theorized to form in compact starburst galaxies in which star growth is much higher than in other types of galaxies. This accelerated star growth results in more prevalent solar winds being present in starburst galaxies. Superwinds form when ejecta released either by supernovae or solar winds collide with such force that the shock from the impact converts the kinetic energy of the ejecta into thermal energy. The violent conversion from kinetic to thermal energy prevents a significant amount of energy from being radiated away. This in turn creates an incredibly hot bubble of gas that is under much greater pressure than it surroundings are. Eventually the gas bubble will expand to encompass other particles of ejected gases, further increasing the force and size of its expansion. This "snowplow" effect results in a gust of stellar wind and gas that can span the width of a galaxy. A paper produced by the California Institute of Technology theorized that superwinds can potentially be traveling at a velocity of several thousand kilometers per second by the time they enter the intergalactic medium.
