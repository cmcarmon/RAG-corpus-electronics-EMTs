One of the equivalent reformulations of Cannon's conjecture, originally posed by James W. Cannon in terms of word-hyperbolic groups with boundaries homeomorphic to





S


2




{\displaystyle \mathbb {S} ^{2}}
, says that if



G


{\displaystyle G}
is a group acting as a discrete uniform convergence group on





S


2




{\displaystyle \mathbb {S} ^{2}}
then this action is topologically conjugate to an action induced by a geometric action of



G


{\displaystyle G}
on





H


3




{\displaystyle \mathbb {H} ^{3}}
by isometries. This conjecture still remains open.
