Some other properties of the Laplace transform are listed in Table 3.3.2.
From the entries of Table 3.3.2, observe the time–frequency dualism regarding frequency
differentiation, frequency integration, and frequency shifting. The initial-value and ﬁnal-value
theorems also display the dualism of the time and frequency domains. As seen later, these theorems
will be effectively applied in the network solutions.
