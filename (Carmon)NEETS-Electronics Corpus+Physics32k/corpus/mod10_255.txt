Radio waves may be reflected from various substances or objects they meet during travel between 
the transmitting and receiving sites. The amount of reflection depends on the reflecting material. Smooth 
metal surfaces of good electrical conductivity are efficient reflectors of radio waves. The surface of the 
Earth itself is a fairly good reflector. The radio wave is not reflected from a single point on the reflector 
but rather from an area on its surface. The size of the area required for reflection to take place depends on 
the wavelength of the radio wave and the angle at which the wave strikes the reflecting substance.
