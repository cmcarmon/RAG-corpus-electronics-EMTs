Timing Results
Note that part of the overhead of a mantissa checksum test is
extracting the mantissas of the input matrices or vectors and
also extracting and denormalizing the mantissas of the inter-
mediate multiplications ai, j  bj, k. The latter overhead can be
eliminated by a very simple modiﬁcation to the ﬂoating point
multiplication unit that is shown in Figure 8.21. With this
modiﬁcation, the mantissa that is not normalized is also avail-
able (along with the normalized mantissa) as an output of the
ﬂoating point multiplier. In many computers, the ﬂoating
point product is also available in the form that is not normal-
ized by using the appropriate multiply instruction—this
requires tinkering with the compiler in such a machine to
use the non-normalized multiply instruction where appropri-
ate. No hardware modiﬁcation is needed in this case to extract
the mantissa for free.
