A sundial is a device that measures time by using a light spot or shadow cast by the position of the Sun on a reference scale. As the earth turns on its polar axis, the sun appears to cross the sky from east to west, rising at sun-rise from beneath the horizon to a zenith at mid-day and falling again behind the horizon at sunset. Both the azimuth (direction) and the altitude (height) can be used to create time measuring devices. Sundials have been invented independently in all major cultures and become more accurate and sophisticated as the culture developed.
