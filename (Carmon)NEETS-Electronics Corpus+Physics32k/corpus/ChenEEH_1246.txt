multiple processors coordinate with each other. In addition,
the following two performance goals of multiprocessor system
are explored: (l) increased throughput for independent tasks
distributed among a number of processors, and (2) faster
execution of a single task on multiple processors. The organ-
ization and programming language for the multiprocessor
systems vary signiÔ¨Åcantly, depending on the goal.
