Periodic Waveform Distortion
Harmonics are sinusoidal voltages or currents having frequencies that are whole multiples of the frequency at
which the supply system is designed to operate (e.g., 50 Hz or 60 Hz). An illustration of Ô¨Åfth harmonic distortion
is shown in Fig. 62.1. When the frequencies of these voltages and currents are not an integer of the fundamental
they are termed interharmonics.
