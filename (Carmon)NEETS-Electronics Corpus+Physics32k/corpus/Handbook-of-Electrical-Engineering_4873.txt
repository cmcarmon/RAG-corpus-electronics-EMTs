In  these  circumstances  a  semiclassical  description  of  the  phenomenon  is  usually  adequate.  This  description
combines the classical Boltzmann transport equation with the Fermiâ€“Dirac distribution function for the charge
carriers  (electrons  or  holes)  [Ziman,  1960],  and  this  is  the  point  of  view  that  will  be  taken  in  this  chapter.
Examples of Hall effect that cannot be treated semiclassically are the spontaneous (or extraordinary) Hall effect
that occurs in ferromagnetic conductors [Berger and Bergmann, 1980], the quantum Hall effect [Prange and
Girvin, 1990], and the Hall effect that arises in conjuction with hopping conductivity [Emin, 1977].
