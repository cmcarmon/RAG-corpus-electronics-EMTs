Aerocapture is part of a unique family of "aeroassist" technologies being developed by NASA for science missions to any planetary body with an appreciable atmosphere. These destinations could include Mars, Venus and Saturn's moon Titan, along with the outer planets.
Aerobraking is another aeroassist maneuver that shares some similarities but also some key marked differences with Aerocapture. Aerobraking also uses the celestial body’s atmosphere to slow the aircraft down into the desired orbit however unlike aerobraking aerocapture only uses one pass through the atmosphere to reduce its velocity while aerobraking takes on the order of 100 to 400 passes to achieve the desired velocity reduction.
Aerocapture:
• Rapid process (hours to days)
• Descent into a relatively dense mid-atmosphere
• Requires a heavy heat shield due to rapid deceleration resulting in high g-forces
Aerobraking:
• Gradual process (weeks to months)
• Descent into sparse outer atmosphere
• Small reductions in spacecraft velocity per pass thus no additional mass for a heat shield is necessary
One of the main advantages of using an aerocapture technique over that of an aerobraking technique is that it enables mission concepts for human spaceflight due to the rapid process of transitioning to the desired orbit.
