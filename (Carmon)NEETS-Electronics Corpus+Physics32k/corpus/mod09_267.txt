The circuit in view (D) has all three requirements for an oscillator: (1) amplification, (2) a frequency-
determining device, and (3) regenerative feedback. The oscillator in this schematic drawing is a tuned-
base oscillator, because the fdd is in the base circuit. If the fdd were in the collector circuit, it would be a 
tuned-collector oscillator. The circuit in view (D) is basically an Armstrong oscillator.
