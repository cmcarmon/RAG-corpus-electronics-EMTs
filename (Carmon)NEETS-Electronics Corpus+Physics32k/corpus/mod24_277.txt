Optical fibers composed of plastic have been in use longer than glass fibers. Types of standard fibers
using plastics include multimode step-index and graded-index fibers. Multimode step-index and graded-
index plastic clad silica (PCS) fibers exist. PCS fibers have a silica glass core and a plastic cladding.
Normally, PCS fibers are cheaper than all-glass fibers but have limited performance characteristics. PCS
fibers lose more light through a plastic cladding than a glass cladding.
