Rectangular ï¬‚oorplans can be obtained using simulated annealing and genetic algorithms. Both techniques
are  used  to  solve  general  optimization  problems  for  which  the  solution  space  is  not  well  understood.  The
approaches are easy to implement, but the algorithms have many parameters which require empirical adjust-
ments, and the results are usually unpredictable.
