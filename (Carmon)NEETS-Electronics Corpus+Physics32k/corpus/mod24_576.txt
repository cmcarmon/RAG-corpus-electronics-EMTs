Power meter measurements connecting a test reference cable between the light source and power
meter. The test reference cable has the same nominal fiber characteristics as the cable under test. The
optical power present at the power meter is the reference power (P1). Disconnect the test reference cable
and connect the optical fiber cable under test between the light source and power meter using test
jumpers. If possible, the test reference cable should be used as the input jumper cable for the test cable
measurement. The test jumper fiber properties, such as core diameter and NA, should be nominally equal
to the fiber properties of the cable being tested. The optical power present at the power meter is test power
(P2).
