Unlike a floppy disk drive, which locates a place on the disk using the surface number, track 
number, and sector number, a hard disk drive locates a place on the disk by using the surface number, 
cylinder number, and sector number. This is true even if the hard disk has only one platter. That's because 
both surfaces of that one platter still form a cylinder.
