Some extensions have been proposed to snoopy protocols
to reduce the amount of bus trafÔ¨Åc generated. In the read-
broadcast (Rudolph and Segall, 1984) protocol, a read-miss
generated by a cache controller will force an update of that line
in every cache. Whether write-invalidate is a better approach
than write-broadcast depends on the pattern of data transfer.
Karlin et al. (1986) proposed a protocol that adaptively decides
which approach to take at run time.
