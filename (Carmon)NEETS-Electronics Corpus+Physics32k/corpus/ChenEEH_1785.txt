To remove these shortcomings, the enhanced Internet ser-
vice models use admission control, bandwidth reservations,
and trafﬁc policing mechanisms. The application must ﬁrst
get permission from some authority to send trafﬁc at a given
rate and with some given trafﬁc characteristics. If the authority
accepts admission, it will reserve appropriate resources (band-
width and buffers) along the path for the application to send
data at the requested rate. Trafﬁc policing mechanisms are
used to ensure that applications do not send at a rate higher
than what was initially negotiated.
