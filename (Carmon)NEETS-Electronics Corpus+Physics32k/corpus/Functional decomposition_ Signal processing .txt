Functional decomposition is used in the analysis of many signal processing systems, such as LTI systems. The input signal to an LTI system can be expressed as a function,



f
(
t
)


{\displaystyle f(t)}
. Then



f
(
t
)


{\displaystyle f(t)}
can be decomposed into a linear combination of other functions, called component signals:




f
(
t
)
=

a

1


⋅

g

(
t
)
+

a

2

g

(
t
)

⋯
+

a

n


⋅

g

n


(
t
)


{\displaystyle f(t)=a_{1}\cdot g_{1}(t)+a_{2}\cdot g_{2}(t)+a_{3}\cdot g_{3}(t)+\dots +a_{n}\cdot g_{n}(t)}


Here,



{

g

t
)
,

g

(
t
)
,

g

(
t
)
,
…
,

g

n


(
t
)
}


{\displaystyle \{g_{1}(t),g_{2}(t),g_{3}(t),\dots ,g_{n}(t)\}}
are the component signals. Note that



{

a

,

a

2


,

a

3


,
…
,

a

n


}


{\displaystyle \{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\dots ,a_{n}\}}
are constants. This decomposition aids in analysis, because now the output of the system can be expressed in terms of the components of the input. If we let



T
{
}


{\displaystyle T\{\}}
represent the effect of the system, then the output signal is



T
{
f
(
t
)
}


{\displaystyle T\{f(t)\}}
, which can be expressed as:




T
{
f
(
t
)
}
=
T

}


{\displaystyle T\{f(t)\}=T\{a_{1}\cdot g_{1}(t)+a_{2}\cdot g_{2}(t)+a_{3}\cdot g_{3}(t)+\dots +a_{n}\cdot g_{n}(t)\}}





=

{\displaystyle =a_{1}\cdot T\{g_{1}(t)\}+a_{2}\cdot T\{g_{2}(t)\}+a_{3}\cdot T\{g_{3}(t)\}+\dots +a_{n}\cdot T\{g_{n}(t)\}}


In other words, the system can be seen as acting separately on each of the components of the input signal. Commonly used examples of this type of decomposition are the Fourier series and the Fourier transform.
