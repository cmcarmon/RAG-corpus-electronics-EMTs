When a high frequency current is applied to a Josephson junction, the ac Josephson current will synchronize with the applied frequency giving rise to regions of constant voltage in the I-V curve of the device (Shapiro steps). For the purpose of voltage standards, these steps occur at the voltages

{\displaystyle nf/K_{J}}

{\displaystyle n}
is an integer,

. These steps provide an exact conversion from frequency to voltage. Because frequency can be measured with very high precision, this effect is used as the basis of the Josephson voltage standard, which implements the international definition of the " conventional" volt.
