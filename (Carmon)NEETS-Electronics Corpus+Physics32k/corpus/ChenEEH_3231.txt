In the past, the favored underground cable was stranded
copper with an oil-impregnated paper insulation wrapped in a
lead sheath. It was expensive to buy, install, and splice, but it
had a long service once in service. For example, it is common
to see a 50-year-old paper-insulated cable still in service in
duct vaults. Today, URD cables are made up of a relatively
inexpensive plastic insulation, typically cross-linked polyethyl-
ene (XLPE), and practical elbow connectors. They are buried
directly into ground or placed in narrow and shallow trenches,
which naturally reduces installation and maintenance costs. In
general, the heavy three-phase feeders are overhead along the
periphery of a residential development, and the laterals to
the pad-mount transformers are buried about 40 in deep. The
lateral cable conductors come up from underground into
the high voltage compartment of the transformer. The second-
ary service lines then run to the individual houses at a depth of
about 24 in and come up into a meter through a conduit. The
service conductors are run along easement and do not cross
adjacent property lines.
