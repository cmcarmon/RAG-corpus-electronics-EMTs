When predicting spike occurrences or spot price volatility, one of the most influential fundamental variables is the reserve margin, also called surplus generation. It relates the available capacity (generation, supply),

t




{\displaystyle C_{t}}
, to the demand (load),




D

t




{\displaystyle D_{t}}
, at a given moment in time



t


{\displaystyle t}
. The traditional engineering notion of the reserve margin defines it as the difference between the two, i.e.,



R

t




{\displaystyle RM=C_{t}-D_{t}}
, but many authors prefer to work with dimensionless ratios

or the so-called capacity utilization

{\displaystyle CU_{t}=1-D_{t}/C_{t}}
. Its rare application in EPF can be justified only by the difficulty of obtaining good quality reserve margin data. Given that more and more system operators (see e.g. http://www.elexon.co.uk) are disclosing such information nowadays, reserve margin data should be playing a significant role in EPF in the near future.
