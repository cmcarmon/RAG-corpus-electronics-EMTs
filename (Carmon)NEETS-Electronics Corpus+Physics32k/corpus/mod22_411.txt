Wide area networks provide for global connections and are sometimes referred to as global 
networks. Organizations are able to send information from city to city, across the nation, and to other 
countries throughout the world, through the expansion of local area networks into larger network 
configurations. Combinations of telephone lines, microwave radio links, and satellites are used by these 
larger telecommunications networks to send information. In 1965, the first successful communications 
satellite for business applications was launched. It was not the only try, it was preceded by many more 
primitive satellites. With the launching of larger and more complex satellites, the size and complexity of 
earth stations have been shrinking. Since satellite services' costs have been steadily decreasing, it is 
becoming more cost effective to employ them for business-type uses.
