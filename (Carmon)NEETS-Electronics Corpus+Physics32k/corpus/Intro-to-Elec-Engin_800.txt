In addition to TTL, NMOS, and CMOS, several other logic families have been developed
to suit various purposes. Emitter-coupled logic (ECL) is a high-speed bipolar technology with
high power consumption. Transistors operate in the active mode and do not saturate in ECL;
propagation delays per gate are as short as 1 ns. Besides high power consumption, the logic swing
(which is the difference between high and low voltage levels) is small, being on the order of 1 V,
which makes the ECL vulnerable to random noise voltages, thereby leading to errors.
