DC voltage measurement 
 
Figure  14.9  shows  how  to  make  DC  voltage 
measurements. In both cases, the red and black test 
leads  are  connected  to  the  ‘+’  and  ‘O’ sockets 
respectively. In Fig. 14.9, the range  selector is  set 
to DCV, 50 V. The pointer is reading just less than 
45  on  the  range  that  has  50  as  its  full-scale 
indication  (note  that  there  are  three  calibrated 
voltage scales with maximum indications of 10 V, 
50 V and 250 V respectively. The reading indicated 
is approximately 45 V.  
 
DC current measurement 
 
Figure  14.10  shows  how  to  make  a  DC  current 
measurement.  Once  again,  the  red  and  black  test 
leads  are  connected  to  the  ‘+’  and  ‘O’ sockets 
respectively. The range selector is set to DC, 5 mA. 
In Fig. 14.10, the pointer is reading between 35 and 
40 (and is actually a little closer to 35 than it is to 
40)  on  the  range  that  has  50  as  its  full-scale 
indication.  The  actual  reading  indicated  is  thus 
approximately 3.7 mA.
