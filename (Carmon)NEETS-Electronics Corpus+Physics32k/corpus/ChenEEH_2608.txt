This discussion has only presented reciprocal passive compon-
ents, and they were realized with isotropic materials (air or any
other dielectric). Nonreciprocal components, dealt with in the
following, show different properties in different propagation
directions of the wave (electrically and/or magnetically). They
are realized with anisotropic materials, such as ferrimagnetic
and ferromagnetic compounds, that are generically termed as
ferrites. Ferrites are widely used in the design of microwave
passive components to control the amplitude (e.g., attenuators,
limiters), the phase (e.g., phase shifters), frequency (e.g., YIG or
yttrium iron garnet), the transmission paths (e.g., circulators,
isolators, switches), and frequency bandwidth (e.g., Ô¨Ålters)
of microwave signals. Ferrites possess low-loss and high-
anisotropy properties for microwave applications.
