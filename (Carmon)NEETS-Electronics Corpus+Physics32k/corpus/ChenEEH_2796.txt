Structure of an FDTD Grid Employing Berenger’s PML ABC
The analysis in the previous paragraphs can be repeated for
PMLs that are normal to the y direction. This permitted
Berenger to propose the two-dimensional TEz FDTD grid
shown in Figure 9.13, which uses PMLs to greatly reduce
outer-boundary reﬂections. Here, a free-space computation
zone is surrounded by PML backed by perfect electric con-
ductor (PEC) walls. At the left and right sides of the grid
(x1 and x2), each PML has sx and s
x matched according to
equation 9.94 along with sy ¼ 0 ¼ s
y to permit reﬂectionless
transmission across the interface between the free space and
PML regions. At the lower and upper sides of the grid
(y1 and y2), each PML has sy and s
y matched according to
