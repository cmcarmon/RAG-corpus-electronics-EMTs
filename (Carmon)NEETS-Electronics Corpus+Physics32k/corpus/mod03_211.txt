Electric power is measured by means of a wattmeter. This instrument is of the electrodynamic type.
It consists of a pair of fixed coils, known as current coils, and a movable coil known as the potential coil.
(See fig. 1-44.) The fixed coils are made up of a few turns of a comparatively large conductor. The
potential coil consists of many turns of fine wire. It is mounted on a shaft, carried in jeweled bearings, so
that it may turn inside the stationary coils. The movable coil carries a needle which moves over a suitably
marked scale. Spiral coil springs hold the needle to a zero position.
