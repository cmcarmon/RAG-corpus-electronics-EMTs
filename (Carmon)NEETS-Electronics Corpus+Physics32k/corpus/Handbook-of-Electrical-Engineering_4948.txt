) at which the spontaneous plarization goes to zero. (A
few ferroelectrics, such as the polymer polyvinylidene ﬂuoride [PVDF] melt before this temperature is reached.)
The fact that the orientation of the polar axis in ferroelectrics can be changed by the application of a ﬁeld
has a very important consequence for ceramic materials. If a polycrystalline body is made of a polar material,
then the crystal axes will, in general, be randomly oriented. It cannot therefore show pyroelectricity. However,
) is applied to a ferroelectric ceramic, then the polar axes
