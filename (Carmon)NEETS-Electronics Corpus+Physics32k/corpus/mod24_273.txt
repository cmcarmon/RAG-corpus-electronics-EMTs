A single mode step-index fiber has low attenuation and high bandwidth properties. Present
applications for single mode fibers include long-haul, high-speed telecommunication systems. Future
applications include single mode fibers for sensor systems. However, the current state of single mode
technology makes installation of single mode systems expensive and difficult. Short cable runs, low to
moderate bandwidth requirements, and high component cost make installation of single mode fiber
shipboard systems impractical at this time.
