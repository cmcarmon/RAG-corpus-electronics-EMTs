A box is the symbol for multiplication; the input quantity is multiplied by the function in the
box to obtain the output. With circles indicating summing points (in an algebraic sense) and with
boxes or blocks denoting multiplication, any linear mathematical expression may be represented
by block-diagram notation, as in Figure 3.4.12 for the case of an elementary feedback control
system.
