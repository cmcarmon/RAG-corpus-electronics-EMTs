implied in the case of asymptotic stability, a stronger concept
of exponential stability implies that the rate of convergence
toward a stable solution is bounded from above by an expo-
nential function. Note that the exponential convergence to a
solution does not necessarily imply its stability. Contrary to
nonlinear circuits, stability (if it exists) of linear time-invariant
circuits is always exponential. Linear time-invariant circuits
whose natural frequencies have negative real parts have stable
solutions. A global asymptotic (complete) stability implies that
no matter what the initial conditions are, the solutions con-
verge toward each other. Hence, a completely stable circuit
possesses exactly one solution.
