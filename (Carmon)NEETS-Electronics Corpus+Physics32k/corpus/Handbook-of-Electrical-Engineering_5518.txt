When used for voltage control, the action of shunt capacitors is different from that of synchronous condens-
ers, since their reactive power varies as the square of the voltage, whereas the synchronous machine maintains
approximately constant kVA for sudden voltage changes. The synchronous condenser has a greater stabilizing
effect upon system voltages. The losses of the synchronous condenser are much greater than those of capacitors.
Note that in determining the amount of shunt capacitor kVAR required, since a voltage rise increases the
lagging kVAR in the exciting currents of transformer and motors, some additional capacitor kVAR above that
based on initial conditions without capacitors may be required to get the desired correction. If the load includes
synchronous motors, it may be desirable, if possible, to increase the Ô¨Åeld currents to these motors.
