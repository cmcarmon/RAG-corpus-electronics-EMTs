The  beneﬁt  offered  by  the  CrossCheck  technique  is  due  to  the  potential  for  the  reduced  number  of  test
patterns necessary to test an ASIC. This is due to the fact that as observability of internal nodes is increased it
becomes easier to generate efﬁcient test patterns which can detect many faults simultaneously. Furthermore,
increased observability of internal nodes also improves diagnosability and may help determine the root cause
of a failure sooner. On the negative side, the CrossCheck technique does not help improve controllability of
internal nodes as achieved using scan-path techniques. Also, a primary disadvantage of the CrossCheck meth-
odology  is  area  penalty  due  to  routing  channels  that  must  be  set  aside  for  the  grid  structure.  Furthermore,
added capacitance of the cross-point switches may affect performance, especially in high-speed applications.
In addition, since the technique offers very good observability but no controllability of the internal nodes, it
lacks the advantage offered by scan-based approaches for system debug and internal path-delay testing [Der-
visoglu and Stong, 1991]. However, recent advances have been made that improve the controllability of internal
nodes using the CrossCheck technique in gate-array ICs.
