Alternatively, the microstrip ground plane can be modiﬁed
to accommodate the printed wire antenna. Recently, a new
type of microstrip-compatible planar end-ﬁre antenna based
on the well-known Yagi-Uda antenna has been developed. The
layout and an X-band prototype of the quasi-Yagi antenna are
shown in Figure 11.20. The antenna uses the truncated micro-
strip ground plane as the reﬂector and uses a microstrip-CPS
transition as balanced feed on a single-layer high-dielectric
substrate (Duroid, er ¼ 10:2). The X-band antenna shown in
this ﬁgure uses a 0.635-mm thick Duroid.
