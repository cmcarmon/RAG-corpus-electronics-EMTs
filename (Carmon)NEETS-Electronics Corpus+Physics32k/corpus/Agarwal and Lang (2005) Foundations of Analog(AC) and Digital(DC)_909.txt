e) Now assume that RON = 1k and repeat parts (a), (b), and (c).
e x e r c i s e 6.5 Compute the worst-case power consumed by the inverter shown
in Figure 6.60. The MOSFET has a threshold voltage VT = 2 V. Assume that VS = 5 V
and RL = 10 k. Model the MOSFET using its switch-resistor model, and assume that
the on-state resistance of the MOSFET is RON = 1 k.
e x e r c i s e 6.6 Consider again the circuits in Figure 6.59. Using the switch-
resistor model of the MOSFET, choose minimum values for the various resistors in
Figure 6.59 so each circuit satisfies the static discipline with voltage thresholds given by
VIL = VOL = VS/10 and VIH = VOH = 4VS/5. Assume the on-state resistance of the
MOSFET is RON and that its turn-on threshold voltage VT = VS/9.
e x e r c i s e 6.7 Consider a family of logic gates that operates under the static
discipline with the following voltage thresholds: VOL = 0.5 V, VIL = 1.6 V, VOH =
4.4 V, and VIH = 3.2 V.
