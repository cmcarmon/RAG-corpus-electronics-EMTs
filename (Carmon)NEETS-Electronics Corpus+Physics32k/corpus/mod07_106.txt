The second type of impurity, when added to a semiconductor material, tends to compensate for its
deficiency of 1 valence electron by acquiring an electron from its neighbor. Impurities of this type have
only 3 valence electrons and are called TRIVALENT impurities. Aluminum, indium, gallium, and boron
are trivalent impurities. Because these materials accept 1 electron from the doped material, they are also
called ACCEPTOR impurities.
