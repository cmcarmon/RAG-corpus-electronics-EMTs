Again, refer to figure 4-4. With the function switch set to either +DC or - DC, letâ€™s consider the
effect of the range switch on the meter scale to be used. When measuring dc voltages, you have eight
voltage ranges available: .25V, 2.5V, 10V, 50V, 250V, and 500V (1- and 1,000-volt special application
plug-ins are also available). The setting of the range switch determines the maximum value represented
on the meter. When measuring dc voltages, use the scale marked DC (figure 4-3). The last number at the
extreme right side of the DC scale indicates the maximum value of the range being used. When the range
switch is in the 2.5V position, the scale represents a maximum of 2.5 volts.
