Hans Ferdinand Mayer: After earning his doctorate in physics in 1920, he turned to com-
munications engineering when he joined Siemens & Halske in 1922.
In 1926, he published in a
German technical journal the Mayer-Norton equivalent. During his interesting career, he rose to
lead Siemens’s Central Laboratory in 1936, surreptitiously leaked to the British all he knew of
German warfare capabilities a month after the Nazis invaded Poland, was arrested by the Gestapo
in 1943 for listening to BBC radio broadcasts, spent two years in Nazi concentration camps, and
went to the United States for four years working for the Air Force and Cornell University before
returning to Siemens in 1950. He rose to a position on Siemens’s Board of Directors before retiring.
