Fiber-to-fiber connection loss is affected by intrinsic and extrinsic coupling losses. Intrinsic
coupling losses are caused by inherent fiber characteristics. Extrinsic coupling losses are caused by
jointing techniques. Fiber-to-fiber connection loss is increased by the following sources of intrinsic and
extrinsic coupling loss:
