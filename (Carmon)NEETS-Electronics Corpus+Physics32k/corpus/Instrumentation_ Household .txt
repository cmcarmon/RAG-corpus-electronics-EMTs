A very simple example of an instrumentation system is a mechanical thermostat, used to control a household furnace and thus to control room temperature. A typical unit senses temperature with a bi-metallic strip. It displays temperature by a needle on the free end of the strip. It activates the furnace by a mercury switch. As the switch is rotated by the strip, the mercury makes physical (and thus electrical) contact between electrodes.
Another example of an instrumentation system is a home security system. Such a system consists of sensors (motion detection, switches to detect door openings), simple algorithms to detect intrusion, local control (arm/disarm) and remote monitoring of the system so that the police can be summoned. Communication is an inherent part of the design.
Kitchen appliances use sensors for control.
A refrigerator maintains a constant temperature by measuring the internal temperature.
A microwave oven sometimes cooks via a heat-sense-heat-sense cycle until sensing done.
An automatic ice machine makes ice until a limit switch is thrown.
Pop-up bread toasters can operate by time or by heat measurements.
Some ovens use a temperature probe to cook until a target internal food temperature is reached.
A common toilet refills the water tank until a float closes the valve. The float is acting as a water level sensor.
