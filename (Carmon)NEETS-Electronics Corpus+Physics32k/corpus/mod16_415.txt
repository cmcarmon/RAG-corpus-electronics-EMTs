The majority of the electronic circuits you will encounter in equipment will be low-current circuits,
and most voltage readings will be direct current. Also, many of the schematics will indicate the voltages
at various test points. Therefore, if you suspect that a certain stage is defective, you can check the voltage
by connecting a voltmeter from the test point to ground. If the suspected stage is not defective, the
voltmeter readings should match the voltages given on the schematic.
