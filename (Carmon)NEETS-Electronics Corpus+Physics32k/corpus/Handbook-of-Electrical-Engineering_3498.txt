Multichip Modules
The thermostructural complexity of the multichip modules in current use hampers effective thermal charac-
terization and introduces signiﬁcant uncertainty in any attempt to compare the thermal performance of these
packaging  conﬁgurations. Variations  in  heat  generation  patterns  across  the  active  chips  (e.g.,  devices  versus
drivers), as well as nonuniformities in heat dissipation among the chips assembled in a single module, further
complicate this task. To establish a common, though approximate, basis for comparison of multichip modules,
it is possible to neglect these variations and consider that the heat generated by each chip ﬂows through a unit
cell of the module structure to the external coolant [Bar-Cohen, 1987, 1988]. For a given structure, increasing
the area of the unit cell allows heat to spread from the chip to a larger cross section, reducing the heat ﬂux at
some  of  the  thermally  critical  interfaces  and  at  the  convectively  cooled  surfaces.  Consequently,  the  thermal
performance  of  a  multichip  module  can  be  best  represented  by  the  area-speciﬁc  thermal  resistance,  i.e.,  the
temperature  difference  between  the  chip  and  the  coolant  divided  by  the  substrate  heat  ﬂux.  This  ﬁgure-of-
merit is equivalent to the inverse of the overall heat transfer coefﬁcient, U, commonly used in the compact heat
exchanger  literature.  Despite  signiﬁcant  variation  in  design  and  fabrication,  all  the  late-1980s  water-cooled
modules and one air-cooled module provide a speciﬁc thermal resistance of approximately 20(cid:176)C for every watt
per square centimeter at the substrate. In cutting-edge multichip modules in use in the 1990s, this value was
reduced to 5–10 K/(W/cm2).
