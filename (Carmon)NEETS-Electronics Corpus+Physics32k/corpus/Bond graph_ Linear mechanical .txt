The steps for solving an Linear Mechanical problem as a bond graph are as follows:
Place 1-junctions for each distinct velocity (usually at a mass)
Insert R and C bonds at their own 0-junctions between the 1 junctions where they act
Insert Sources and I bonds on the 1 junctions where they act
Assign power flow direction
Simplify
These steps are shown more clearly in the examples below.
