When a new battery is shipped dry, the plates are in an uncharged condition. After the electrolyte has 
been added, it is necessary to charge the battery. This is accomplished by giving the battery a long low-
rate initial charge. The charge is given in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, which are 
shipped with each battery. If the manufacturer's instructions are not available, reference should be made 
to the detailed instructions for charging batteries found in current Navy directives.
