A relative position vector is a vector that defines the position of one point relative to another. It is the difference in position of the two points. The position of one point A relative to another point B is simply the difference between their positions






P

/

B


=


P


A


−


P


B




{\displaystyle \mathbf {P} _{A/B}=\mathbf {P} _{A}-\mathbf {P} _{B}}

which is the difference between the components of their position vectors.
If point A has position components





P


A


=

(


X

A


,

Y

A


,

Z

A



)



{\displaystyle \mathbf {P} _{A}=\left(X_{A},Y_{A},Z_{A}\right)}

If point B has position components





P


B


=

(


X

B


,

Y

B


,

Z

B



)



{\displaystyle \mathbf {P} _{B}=\left(X_{B},Y_{B},Z_{B}\right)}

then the position of point A relative to point B is the difference between their components:
