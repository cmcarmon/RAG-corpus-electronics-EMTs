Although the speed limit can be raised to 70 mph based on engineering studies under current law, ODOT has not identified any freeway sections that it believes should be raised beyond the 65 mph limit. In 2004, ODOT had released an engineering study on the average and 85th percentile speeds on interstate highways. This study found that the 85th percentile speed on rural interstates by passenger cars was 71.1 mph with a statewide average of 66.3 mph. The engineering study recommended raising the speed limit on rural interstates to 70 mph. Despite this, ODOT initially refused to post the 70 mph limit due to safety concerns and its associated monetary costs; however, there appears to be no higher fatality levels in other states when the limit was raised. In all rural areas in Oregon, the speed limit is 55 unless otherwise posted.
Until 2002, Oregon state law required that all speed limit signs omit the word LIMIT from their display. The reasoning behind this was related to the explicit "basic speed" law that existed, which allowed citation for exceeding speeds "too fast for conditions" regardless of the posted speed. The typeface of the numerals on the signs varies greatly depending on which jurisdiction made the sign, due to its non-standardized design. In 2002, the Oregon Department of Transportation revised its supplement to the MUTCD, mandating the omission of the word LIMIT except on signs posted on Interstate highways and within city limits. As of 2014, ODOT has replaced nearly all SPEED signs posted on Interstates with SPEED LIMIT signs, but it was left to the various city governments to replace signs in their jurisdictions at their leisure, if at all. Thus, older SPEED signs are still a common sight across the state.
