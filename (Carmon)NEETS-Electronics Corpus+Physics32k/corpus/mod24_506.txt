with respect to wavelength. Generally, the group delay as a function of wavelength is fit to a simple
mathematical function and the derivative calculated. The range of wavelengths over which meaningful
data is obtained depends on the wavelength range of optical source(s) used. The zero-dispersion
wavelength ( l 0) and the zero-dispersion slope (S0) are determined from the chromatic dispersion curve.
Q12. Delay differences between the source wavelengths occur as the optical signal propagates along
