An example of a primary cell is a Leclanche cell, 
also called a dry cell (Figure 12-12). This type of 
cell is not actually dry. It contains a moist paste as the 
electrolyte. A seal prevents the paste from leaking out 
when the cell is turned sideways or upside down. The 
electrolyte in a dry cell is a solution of ammonium 
chloride and manganese dioxide. The electrolyte dis-
solves the zinc electrode (the case of the cell), leaving 
an excess of electrons with the zinc. As the current is 
removed from the cell, the zinc, ammonium chloride, 
and manganese dioxide produce manganese dioxide, 
water, ammonia, and zinc chloride. The carbon rod 
(center electrode) gives up the extra electrons that ac-
cumulate on the zinc electrode. This type of cell pro-
duces as much as 1.75 to 1.8 volts when new. A typical 
Leclanche cell has an energy density of approximately 
120 watt-hours per pound. As the cell is used, the 
chemical action decreases, and eventually the result-
ing current ceases. If the cell is not used, the electro-
lytic paste eventually dries out. The cell has a shelf life 
of about two years. The output voltage of this type of 
cell is determined entirely by the materials used for the 
electrolyte and the electrodes. The AAA cell, AA cell, 
C cell, and D cell (Figure 12-13) are all constructed of 
the same materials and therefore produce the same
