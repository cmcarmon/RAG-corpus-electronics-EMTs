The SCR is an extremely fast switch. It is difficult to cycle a mechanical switch several hundred 
times a minute; yet, some SCRs can be switched 25,000 times a second. It takes just microseconds 
(millionths of a second) to turn on or off these units. Varying the time that a switch is on as compared to 
the time that it is off regulates the amount of power flowing through the switch. Since most devices can 
operate on pulses of power (alternating current is a special form of alternating positive and negative 
pulse), the SCR can be used readily in control applications. Motor-speed controllers, inverters, remote 
switching units, controlled rectifiers, circuit overload protectors, latching relays, and computer logic 
circuits all use the SCR.
