As was the case with the positive clamper, the amplitude and wave, shape of the output is almost 
identical to that of the input. However, note that the upper extremity of the output wave shape is clamped 
to 0 volts; that is, the output wave shape, for all practical purposes, lies entirely below the 0-volt reference 
level.
