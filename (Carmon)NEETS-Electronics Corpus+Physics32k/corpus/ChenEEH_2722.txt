The FDTD algorithm for Maxwellâ€™s curl equations reviewed in
Section 9.3 causes nonphysical results such as dispersion of the
simulated waves in a free space computational lattice. That is,
the phase velocity of numerical wave modes can differ from c
by an amount varying with the wavelength, direction of propa-
gation in the grid, and grid discretization. This artifact causes
propagating numerical waves to accumulate delay or phase
errors that can lead to nonphysical results, such as broadening
and ringing of pulsed waveforms, imprecise cancellation of
multiple scattered waves, anisotropy, and pseudorefraction.
Numerical dispersion is a factor that must be accounted to
understand the operation of FDTD algorithms and their ac-
curacy limits, especially for electrically large structures.
