we  see  that  the  detected  signal  S(tx,ty)  is  the  two-dimensional  Fourier  transform  of  the  magnetic  resonance
signal  s(x,y)  with  u  =  gGxtx/2p,  v  =  gGyty/2p.  The  magnetic  resonance  signal  s(x,y)  depends  on  the  precise
sequence of pulses of magnetic energy used to perturb the nuclei. For a typical sequence known as spin-echo
consisting of a 90-degree pulse followed by a 180-degree pulse spaced at time t with the data collection at te =
2t, and tr being the repetition time between 90-degree pulses, the detected magnetic resonance signal can be
expressed
