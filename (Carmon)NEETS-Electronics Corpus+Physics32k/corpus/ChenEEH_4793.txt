The proposed NDP design has been implemented on a single
cart–pole balancing problem. To begin with, the self-learning
controller has no prior knowledge about the plant but only of
online measurements. The objective is to balance a single pole
mounted on a cart, which can move either to the right or to
the left on a bounded, horizontal track. The goal for the
learning controller is to provide a force (applied to the cart)
of a ﬁxed magnitude in either the right or the left direction so
that the pole stands balanced and avoids hitting the track
boundaries. The controller receives reinforcement only after
the pole has fallen.
