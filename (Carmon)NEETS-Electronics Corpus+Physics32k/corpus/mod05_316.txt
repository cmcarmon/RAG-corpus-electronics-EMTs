costs relatively little to manufacture. The induction motor has a rotor that is not connected to an external
source of voltage. The induction motor derives its name from the fact that ac voltages are induced in the
rotor circuit by the rotating magnetic field of the stator. In many ways, induction in this motor is similar
to the induction between the primary and secondary windings of a transformer.
