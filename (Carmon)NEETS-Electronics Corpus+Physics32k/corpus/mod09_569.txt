At T2 the âˆ’25 volt input signal and the +33 volts across C1 are series opposing. This makes the 
voltage across the output terminals +8 volts. The cathode of the diode is 2 volts negative with respect to 
its anode and D1 conducts. Again, since the forward-biased diode is essentially a short, C1 quickly 
charges from +33 volts to +35 volts. During most of the time from T2 to T3, then, we find the output 
voltage is +10 volts.
