. FM pulse compression: In the linear FM pulse compres-
sion, the transmitted waveform consists of a rectangular
pulse of constant amplitude. The frequency increases
linearly over the duration of the pulse. On reception,
the echo is passed through a pulse compression ﬁlter, or
a matched ﬁlter. The output is the autocorrelation of the
modulated pulse. The peak power of
the correlator
output is increased by the pulse compression ratio.
