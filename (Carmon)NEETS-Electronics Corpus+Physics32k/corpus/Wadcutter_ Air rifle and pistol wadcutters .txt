Target airguns used for 10 metre air rifle and 10 metre air pistol competitions generally shoot wadcutter pellets at muzzle velocities around 175 m/s (570 ft/s). The use of wadcutter match diabolo pellets is nearly universal in airgun target shooting where paper targets are used, at distances of 25 meters or less.
