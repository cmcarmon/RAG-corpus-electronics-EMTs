Often the stator windings are connected to the supply by a three-wire connection, as shown in Fig. 66.38.
With  a  three-wire  connection,  the  stator  zero-sequence  current,  i0s,  or  (ias  +  ibs  +  ics)/3,  is  zero  by  physical
constraint,  irrespective  of  whether  the  phase  currents  are  balanced  or  not.  The  phase  currents  could  be
unbalanced, as in single-phasing operation. The stator neutral is free-ï¬‚oating. Its voltage, vsg, measured with
respect to some ground point g, need not be zero. Where the applied voltages are non-sinusoidal, as in the case
when the supply is from a bridge inverter, vsg is not zero.
