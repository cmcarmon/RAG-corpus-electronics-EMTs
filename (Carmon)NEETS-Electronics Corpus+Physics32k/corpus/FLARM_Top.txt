FLARM is an electronic system used to selectively alert pilots to potential collisions between aircraft. It is not formally an implementation of ADS-B, as it is optimized for the specific needs of light aircraft, not for long-range communication or ATC interaction. FLARM is a portmanteau of "flight" and "alarm". The installation of all FLARM devices is approved as an EASA Standard Change, and PowerFLARM Core specifically has been approved as a Minor Change by EASA. In addition to the Standard Change, the Minor Change approves PowerFLARM Core to be used during IFR and at night.
