Laser interferometry techniques are widely used in a range of sensing applications, including the measurement of vibration, displacement and velocity of objects. These methods involve the mixing (or superposition) of coherent light waves. Typically, the light from a laser is split into two. Each beam follows a different path before being recombined. A detector is then used to measure the intensity of the light. The Michelson interferometer and Machâ€“Zehnder interferometers are examples of such systems.

In contrast to conventional interferometers, the interference in self-mixing interferometers occurs in the laser cavity between the internal optical field and a beam backscattered by an external target. The variation of the optical path length causes fluctuations of the back-reflected phase signal. The back-reflected phase signal enters the laser cavity and causes a modulation of the laser. Thus, the optical power of the laser is a modulated waveform. This waveform of the optical output power can be used to estimate the target velocity.
