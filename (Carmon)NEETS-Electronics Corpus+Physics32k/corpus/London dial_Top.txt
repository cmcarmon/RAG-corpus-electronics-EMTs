A London dial in the broadest sense can mean any sundial that is set for 51Â°.30' N, but more specifically refers to a engraved brass horizontal sundial with a distinctive design. London dials were originally engraved by scientific instrument makers. The trade was heavily protected by the system of craft guilds.
