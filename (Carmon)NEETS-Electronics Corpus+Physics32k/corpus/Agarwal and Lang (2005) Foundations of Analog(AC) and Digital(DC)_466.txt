This modification to the original node analysis is not always the most
efficient method of analysis, but it always works. However, when the element
laws for the dependent sources can be easily expressed in terms of the node
voltages, it is possible to take a more intuitive approach and apply the simple
node analysis described in Section 3.3 without modification. In our example of
Figure 3.23, suppose that the circuit on the left has the node voltages shown
