forward bias of Q1 changes to 0.6 volt. Because this bias voltage is less than the normal 0.7 volt, the 
resistance of Q1 increases, thereby increasing the voltage drop across the transistor to 5.8 volts. This 
voltage drop restores the output voltage to 14.3 volts. The entire cycle takes only a fraction of a second 
and, therefore, the change is not visible on an oscilloscope or readily measurable with other standard test 
equipment.
