In 1923–24, Noether applied her ideal theory to elimination theory—in a formulation that she attributed to her student, Kurt Hentzelt—showing that fundamental theorems about the factorization of polynomials could be carried over directly. Traditionally, elimination theory is concerned with eliminating one or more variables from a system of polynomial equations, usually by the method of resultants. For illustration, a system of equations often can be written in the form of a matrix M (missing the variable x) times a vector v (having only different powers of x) equaling the zero vector, M•v = 0. Hence, the determinant of the matrix M must be zero, providing a new equation in which the variable x has been eliminated.
