There are two main classes of biasingâ€”FIXED and SELF. In a tube circuit that uses fixed bias, the
grid-bias voltage is supplied from a power source external to the circuit. You are already familiar with
battery bias, which is one form of fixed bias. When fixed bias is used in a circuit, it can be represented as
either a battery (fig. 1-21, view A), or as a conductor connected to -Ecc (fig. 1-21, view B). Fixed bias is
rarely used in electronics today. Therefore, we will not discuss it further.
