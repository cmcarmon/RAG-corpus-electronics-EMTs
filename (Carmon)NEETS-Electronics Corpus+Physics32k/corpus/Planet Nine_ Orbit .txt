Planet Nine is hypothesized to follow a highly elliptical orbit around the Sun lasting 10,000–20,000 years. The planet's semi-major axis is estimated to be 700 AU, roughly 20 times the distance from Neptune to the Sun, and its inclination to be about 30°±10°. The high eccentricity of Planet Nine's orbit could bring it as close as 200 AU at its perihelion and take it as far away as 1,200 AU at its aphelion.
The aphelion, or farthest point from the Sun, would be in the general direction of the constellation of Taurus, whereas the perihelion, the nearest point to the Sun, would be in the general direction of the southerly areas of Serpens (Caput), Ophiuchus, and Libra.
Brown thinks that if Planet Nine is confirmed to exist, a probe could fly by it in as little as 20 years, with a powered slingshot around the Sun.
