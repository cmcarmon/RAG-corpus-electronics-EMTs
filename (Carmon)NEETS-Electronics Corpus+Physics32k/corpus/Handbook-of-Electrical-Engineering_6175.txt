Superheterodyne Technique
Most  receivers  employ  the 
technique  (see  Fig. 69.3).  This  technique  consists  of
either  down-converting  or  up-converting  the  input  signal  to  some  convenient  frequency  band,  called  the
intermediate frequency
 (IF) band, and then extracting the information (or modulation) by using the appropriate
detector. This basic receiver structure is used for the reception of all types of bandpass signals, such as television,
FM, AM, satellite, and radar signals.
