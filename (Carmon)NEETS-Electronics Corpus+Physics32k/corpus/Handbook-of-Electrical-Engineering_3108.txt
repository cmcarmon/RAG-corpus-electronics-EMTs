Thyristor and Triac
The thyristor, also called a silicon-controlled rectiﬁer (SCR), is basically a four-layer three-junction 
 device.
It has three terminals: anode, cathode, and gate. The device is turned on by applying a short pulse across the
gate and cathode. Once the device turns on, the gate loses its control to turn off the device. The turn-off is
achieved by applying a 
across the anode and cathode. The thyristor symbol and its volt-ampere
characteristics are shown in Fig. 30.1. There are basically two classiﬁcations of thyristors: converter grade and
inverter  grade.  The  difference  between  a  converter-grade  and  an  inverter-grade  thyristor  is  the  low  turn-off
time (on the order of a few microseconds) for the latter. The converter-grade thyristors are slow type and are
used in natural commutation (or phase-controlled) applications. Inverter-grade thyristors are used in forced
commutation applications such as dc-dc choppers and dc-ac inverters. The inverter-grade thyristors are turned
off by forcing the current to zero using an external commutation circuit. This requires additional commutating
components, thus resulting in additional losses in the inverter.
