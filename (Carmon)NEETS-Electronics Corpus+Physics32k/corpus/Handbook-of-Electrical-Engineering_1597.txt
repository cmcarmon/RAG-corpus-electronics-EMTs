associated with Eq. (16.14) satisﬁes all the interpolation properties described before. In Eq. (16.14), the solution
r(z) [ 0 gives H(z) = 1/Pn(z), a pure AR(n) system that coincides with Burg’s maximum entropy extension.
Clearly,  if  Hr(z)  is  rational,  then  r(z)  must  be  rational  and,  more  interestingly,  every  rational  system  must
follow from Eq. (16.14) for a speciﬁc rational bounded function r(z). Of course, the choice of r(z) brings in
extra freedom, and this can be proﬁtably used for system identiﬁcation as well as rational and stable approxi-
mation of nonrational systems [Pillai and Shim, 1993].
