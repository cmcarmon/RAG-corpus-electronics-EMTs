1. The equilibrium state x is stable if and only if f(t,t0) is bounded for t ‡ t0.
2. The equilibrium state x is asymptotically stable if and only if f(t,t0) is bounded and tends to zero as t ﬁ ¥.
We use the symbol s to denote complex frequency, i.e., s = s  + jw. For speciﬁc values of s, such as eigenvalues
and poles, we use the symbol l.
