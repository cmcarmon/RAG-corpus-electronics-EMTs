The following MPEG-21 XML description gives the declar-
ation for the digital item depicted in Figure 5.3. As shown next,
the digital item declaration provides a container at the top
level, which forms the logical package for the digital item. It
contains a descriptor that holds the XML statement giving an
MPEG-7 description and an item that contains further de-
scription and sub-item elements. The description contained
by the item holds a plain text statement giving a textual
description of the item. The three sub-items each contain
one component that gives a media resource. The Ô¨Årst one
gives an audio resource (music.mp3); the latter two each give
an image (photo1.jpg and photo2.jpg).
