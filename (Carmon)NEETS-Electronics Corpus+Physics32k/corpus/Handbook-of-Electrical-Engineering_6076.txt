Later work involved looking at the response of the system, not to major disturbances but to the build-up of
oscillations due to small disturbances and poorly set control systems. As the time involved for these disturbances
to occur can be large, time domain solutions are not suitable and frequency domain models of the system were
produced. Lyapunov functions have also been used, but good models have been difﬁcult to produce. However,
they are now of sufﬁciently good quality to compete with time domain models where quick estimates of stability
are needed such as in the day to day operation of a system.
