Many new vehicles are equipped with onboard "Crash Data Recorders or Event Data Recorders" (CDR or EDR). The Bosch CDR Tool is a commercially available tool, allowing to image crash data directly from all supported vehicles giving a detailed report of critical data parameters leading up to and during a crash. Some of the parameters include pre-crash data, vehicle speed, brake status, throttle position, ignition cycles, delta-V, seat belt status, and others.
Hyundai and Kia as well as most heavy commercial vehicles are equipped with EDR, however are not supported by Bosch equipment. To access this information a diagnostic retrieval tool unique to these manufacturers is required.
