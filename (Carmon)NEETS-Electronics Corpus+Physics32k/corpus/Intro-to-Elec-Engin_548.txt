The state table and the state diagram are given in Figures E6.2.4(b) and (c). The horizontal arrows
indicate the times when clock inputs are applied to FF2 and FF3. These times are located by
noting that every time Q1 makes a transition from 1 to 0, FF2 is clocked, and when Q2 goes from
1 to 0, FF3 is clocked.
