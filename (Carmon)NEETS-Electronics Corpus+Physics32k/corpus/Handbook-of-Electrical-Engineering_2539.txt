Figure 24.31 is the hybrid-p small-signal, dynamic, or incremental model for a bipolar transistor, and when
external components are added and simpliﬁcations made, it makes possible the determination of the perfor-
mance of an ampliﬁer using that transistor not only at midfrequencies but at high and low frequencies, too.
