Interchangeable cores can be extracted from one lock type (bored cylindrical lock, mortise lock, padlock and so forth) and then installed into another without requiring the removal or disassembly of any single component. These units are readily adapted for master keying systems and can be set up with spare cores and keys for quick replacement when security is compromised, such as when a key is lost or stolen or when a personnel change takes place. Extracted cores can then be recombinated without urgency and placed back into maintenance storage for future use.
Although operationally similar to removable cores, which come in varying "large format" snowman shapes, interchangeable cores neither dictate nor exclude the use of a particular hardware manufacturer. In other words, whereas a typical large format key system of Brand X must be expanded with Brand X cores and must use Brand X cylindrical locks and cylinder housings, a typical small format key system of Brand A can be expanded with cores from Brands A, B, C, D, E and so on, and can also be used with locks and housings from Brands A, B, C, D, E and so on.
