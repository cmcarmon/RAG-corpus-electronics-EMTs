The Navy began using HIGH FREQUENCIES for radio communications around World War I when 
only a few communications systems were operated on frequencies near 3 megahertz. When we look at the 
extensive present-day use of high frequencies for long-distance communications, the fact that those Navy 
systems were intended for very short-range communications of a few miles seems curious. The general 
belief at the time was that frequencies above 1.5 megahertz were useless for communications purposes.
