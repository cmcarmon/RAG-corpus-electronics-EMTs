Much like the gate abstraction went hand in hand with the static
discipline which dictated the valid range for applied inputs and expected
the amplifier abstraction is associated with the saturation discipline,
outputs
which prescribes constraints on the valid set of applied input signals and
expected output signals. The saturation discipline simply says that the ampli-
fier be operated in the saturation region of the MOSFET. As we shall see shortly,
we choose this definition of the saturation discipline, because the amplifier pro-
vides a good amount of power gain in the saturation region, thereby operating
well as an amplifier.
