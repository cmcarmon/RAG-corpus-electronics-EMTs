Jet force is the exhaust from some machine, esp. aircraft, propelling the object itself in the opposite direction as per Newton's Third Law. An understanding of jet force is intrinsic to the launching of drones, satellites, rockets, airplanes and other airborne machines.
Jet force begins with some propulsion system; in the case of a rocket, this is usually some system that kicks out combustible gases from the bottom. This repulsion system pushes out these gas molecules in the direction opposite the intended motion so rapidly that the opposite force, acting 180Â° away from the direction the gas molecules are moving, (as such, in the intended direction of movement) pushes the rocket up. A common wrong assumption is that the rocket elevates by pushing off the ground. If this were the case, the rocket would be unable to continue moving upwards after the aircraft is no longer close to the ground. Rather, the opposite force by the expelled gases is the reason for movement.
