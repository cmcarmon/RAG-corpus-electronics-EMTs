an important factor to be considered when any two elements are parallel and are spaced so that 
considerable coupling is between them. There is very little mutual impedance between collinear sections. 
Where impedance does exist, it is caused by the coupling between the ends of adjacent elements. Placing 
the ends of elements close together is frequently necessary because of construction problems, especially 
where long lengths of wire are involved.
