Figure  7.48  A simple power amplifier based on a Class  AB complementary output stage and Class  A 
driver stage. This amplifier provides an output of 3 W into an 8 ohm load and  has a  frequency response 
extending from 20 Hz to 50 kHz. Total harmonic distortion (THD) is less than 0.2% at 250 mW output. An 
input of 2 V peak-peak is required for full output.
