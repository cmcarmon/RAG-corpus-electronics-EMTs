TRANSFERRED-ELECTRON SEMICONDUCTORS.â€”The discovery that microwaves could 
be generated by applying a steady voltage across a chip of n-type gallium-arsenide (GaAs) crystal was 
made in 1963 by J.B. Gunn. The device is operated by raising electrons in the crystal to conduction-band 
energy levels that are higher than the level they normally occupy. The overall effect is called the 
transferred-electron effect.
