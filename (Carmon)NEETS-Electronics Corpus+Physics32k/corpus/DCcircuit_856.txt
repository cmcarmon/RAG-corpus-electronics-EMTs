Despite this inherent disadvantage, voltage signals are still used in many applications be-
cause of their extreme design simplicity. One common signal standard is 0-10 volts, meaning
that a signal of 0 volts represents 0 percent of measurement, 10 volts represents 100 percent
of measurement, 5 volts represents 50 percent of measurement, and so on. Instruments de-
signed to output and/or accept this standard signal range are available for purchase from major
manufacturers. A more common voltage range is 1-5 volts, which makes use of the ”live zero”
concept for circuit fault indication.
