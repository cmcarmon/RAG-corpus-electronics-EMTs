This equation states that the power (in watts) equals the voltage (in volts) 
across a component times the current (in amps) passing through that 
component. The nice thing about this equation is that it applies to every 
electronic component, whether it’s a resistor, a light bulb, a capacitor, or 
something else. It tells you the rate at which electrical energy is consumed by 
the component — what that power is.
