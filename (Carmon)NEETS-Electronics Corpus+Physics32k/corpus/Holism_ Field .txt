The field of a whole is not something different and additional to it, it is the continuation of the whole beyond its sensible contours of experience. The field characterizes a whole as a unified and synthesised event in the system of Relativity, that includes not only its present but also its pastâ€”and also its future potentialities. As such, the concept of field entails both activity and structure.
