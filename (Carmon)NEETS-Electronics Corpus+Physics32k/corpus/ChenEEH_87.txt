In a directed graph, parallel edges refer to edges connecting
the same pair of vertices vi and vj the same way from vi to vj or
from vj to vi. For instance, in the graph of Figure 2.1(A), the
edges connecting v1 and v2 are parallel edges. In the directed
graph of Figure 2.1(B), the edges connecting v3 and v4 are
parallel edges. However, the edges connecting v1 and v2 are not
parallel edges because they are not oriented in the same way.
If the end vertices of an edge are not distinct, then the edge
is called a self-loop. The graph of Figure 2.1(A) has one self
loop, and the graph of Figure 2.1(B) has two self-loops. An
edge is said to be incident on its end vertices. In a directed
