Yagi–Uda Arrays
The Yagi–Uda array can be found on rooftops all over the world—the standard TV antenna is a Yagi–Uda array.
The Yagi–Uda array avoids the problem of needing to control the feeding currents to all of the array elements
by driving only one element. The other elements in the Yagi–Uda array are excited by near-ﬁeld coupling from
the driven element.
