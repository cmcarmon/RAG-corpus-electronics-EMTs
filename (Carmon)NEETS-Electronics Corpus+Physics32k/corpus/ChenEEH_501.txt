In a dielectric, the energy gap, Eg , is large so that the valence
bands are completely ﬁlled and conduction bands are totally
devoid of electrons. Typically for a dielectric, Eg is larger then 5
to 6 eV. For semiconductors, energy band gaps vary between
0.1 eV and 3.5 eV. The energy gap of silicon (Si), which is the
most important semiconductor material,
is approximately
1.12 eV at room temperature. The energy gap of silicon diox-
ide—the most widely used dielectric material in microelec-
tronics—is 9 eV. In a metal, the lowest conduction band is
partially ﬁlled with many electrons (usually one electron per
atom), and the metal’s resistance is very small.
