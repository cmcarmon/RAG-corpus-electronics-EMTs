rectiﬁer  and  inverter  can  reverse  their  operation  modes.  Six-step  machine  current,  however,  causes  large
harmonic heating and torque pulsation, which may be quite harmful at low-speed operation. Another disad-
vantage is that the converter system cannot be controlled in open loop like a voltage-fed inverter.
