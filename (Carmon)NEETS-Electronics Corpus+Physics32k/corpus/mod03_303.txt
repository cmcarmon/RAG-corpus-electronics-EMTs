The plug-type fuse is constructed so that it can be screwed into a socket mounted on a control panel
or electrical distribution center. The fuse link is enclosed in an insulated housing of porcelain or glass.
The construction is arranged so the fuse link is visible through a window of mica or glass. Figure 2-4
shows a typical plug-type fuse.
