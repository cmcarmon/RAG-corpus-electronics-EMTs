To calculate the Thévenin-equivalent input resistance of the inverting Op Amp
circuit, we apply a test source at the input, and measure the resulting response.
(There are no internal independent sources to be set to zero.) In Figure 15.12
we have chosen to drive with a test voltage vt, and calculate the resulting current
it. As before, it is equally valid to apply a test current source, and calculate the
resulting voltage. The calculations are greatly simplified if the circuit topology
is taken into account. The input consists of two elements in series: the resistor
Rs, and a complicated circuit that will reduce to the Thévenin-equivalent input
resistance of the rest of the Op Amp circuit. Recognizing this, we can first
calculate the resistance to the right of the Rs (just set Rs to zero in Figure 15.12)
