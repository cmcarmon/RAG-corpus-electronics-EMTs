CD-DA, the standard audio CD, is said to have a data rate of 44.1 kHz/16, meaning that the audio data was sampled 44,100 times per second and with a bit depth of 16. CD-DA is also stereo, using a left and right channel, so the amount of audio data per second is double that of mono, where only a single channel is used.
The bit rate of PCM audio data can be calculated with the following formula:





bit rate

=

sample rate

×

bit depth

×

channels



{\displaystyle {\text{bit rate}}={\text{sample rate}}\times {\text{bit depth}}\times {\text{channels}}}

For example, the bit rate of a CD-DA recording (44.1 kHz sampling rate, 16 bits per sample and two channels) can be calculated as follows:

{\displaystyle 44,100\times 16\times 2=1,411,200\ {\text{bit/s}}=1,411.2\ {\text{kbit/s}}}

The cumulative size of a length of PCM audio data (excluding a file header or other metadata) can be calculated using the following formula:





size in bits

=

sample rate

×

bit depth

×

channels

×

length of time

.


{\displaystyle {\text{size in bits}}={\text{sample rate}}\times {\text{bit depth}}\times {\text{channels}}\times {\text{length of time}}.}

The cumulative size in bytes can be found by dividing the file size in bits by the number of bits in a byte, which is eight:





size in bytes

=


size in bits
8




{\displaystyle {\text{size in bytes}}={\frac {\text{size in bits}}{8}}}

Therefore, 80 minutes (4,800 seconds) of CD-DA data requires 846,720,000 bytes of storage:
