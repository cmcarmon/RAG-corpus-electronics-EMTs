The TUNNEL DIODE is a pn junction with a very high concentration of impurities in both the p and 
n regions. The high concentration of impurities causes it to exhibit the properties of a negative-resistance 
element over part of its range of operation, as shown in the characteristic curve in figure 2-39. In other 
words, the resistance to current flow through the tunnel diode increases as the applied voltage increases 
over a portion of its region of operation. Outside the negative-resistance region, the tunnel diode functions 
essentially the same as a normal diode. However, the very high impurity density causes a junction 
depletion region so narrow that both holes and electrons can transfer across the pn junction by a quantum
