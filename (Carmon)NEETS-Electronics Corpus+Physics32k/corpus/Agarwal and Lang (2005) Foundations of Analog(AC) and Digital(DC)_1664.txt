Implement the logic function Z = A + B + CD using NMOS

transistors alone. In other words, use an NMOS transistor in place of the pull-up resistor.
Your implementation must satisfy a static discipline with low and high voltage thresholds
given by VIL = VOL = VL and VIH = VOH = VH, where 0 < VL < VT < VH < VS.
VS is the power supply voltage. As your answer, specify the W/L values for the pullup
and the pulldown transistors.
