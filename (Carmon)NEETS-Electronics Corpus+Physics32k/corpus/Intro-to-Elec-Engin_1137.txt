which can be veriÔ¨Åed by the reader. Equation (13.2.15) shows that the maximum torque is
independent of the rotor resistance. The slip corresponding to the maximum torque is directly
(cid:7)
proportional to the rotor resistance R
2, however, as seen from Equation (13.2.14). Thus, when
the rotor resistance is increased by inserting external resistance in the rotor of a wound-rotor
induction motor, the maximum internal torque is unaffected, but the speed or slip at which
it occurs is increased, as shown in Figure 13.2.9. Also note that maximum torque and max-
imum power do not occur at the same speed. The student is encouraged to work out the
reason.
