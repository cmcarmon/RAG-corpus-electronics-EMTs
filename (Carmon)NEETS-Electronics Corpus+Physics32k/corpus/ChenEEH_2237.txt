The ﬁrst of the two boundary conditions is equation 2.18:
the potential must be continuous across every boundary. This
condition is equivalent to stating that the tangential E ﬁeld
must be continuous across every boundary. The second con-
dition is the conservation of ﬂux, equation 2.8: the jump
discontinuity of normal D ﬁeld across a boundary must
equal the free surface charge density on that boundary. In the
absence of free boundary charges, this means Dn must be
continuous across the boundary. The third boundary condi-
tion is the total ﬁeld must be regular at inﬁnity.
