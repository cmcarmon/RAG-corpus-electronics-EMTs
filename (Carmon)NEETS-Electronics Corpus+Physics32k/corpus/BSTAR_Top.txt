BSTAR is a way of modeling aerodynamic drag on a satellite in the SGP4 satellite orbit propagation model.
Traditionally, aerodynamic resistance ("drag") is given by





F

ρ

C

d


A

v

2




{\displaystyle F_{D}={\frac {1}{2}}\rho C_{d}Av^{2}}

where



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
is the air density,




C

d




{\displaystyle C_{d}}
is the drag coefficient,



A


{\displaystyle A}
is the frontal area, and



v


{\displaystyle v}
is the velocity.
The acceleration due to drag is then

{\displaystyle a_{D}={\frac {F_{D}}{m}}={\frac {\rho C_{d}Av^{2}}{2m}}}

In aerodynamic theory, the factor

=

m




{\displaystyle B={\frac {C_{d}A}{m}}}

is called the ballistic coefficient, and its unit is area per mass. Further incorporating a reference air density and the factor of two in the denominator, we get the starred ballistic coefficient:

{\displaystyle B^{*}={\frac {\rho _{0}B}{2}}={\frac {\rho _{0}C_{d}A}{2m}}}

thus reducing the expression for the acceleration due to drag to

{\displaystyle a_{D}={\frac {\rho }{\rho _{0}}}B^{*}v^{2}}

As it can be seen,

{\displaystyle B^{*}}
has a unit of inverse length. For orbit propagation purposes, there is a field for BSTAR drag in Two-line element set (TLE) files, where it is to be given in units of inverse Earth radii. The corresponding reference air density is given as 0.1570 kg/m^2/Earth radii.
