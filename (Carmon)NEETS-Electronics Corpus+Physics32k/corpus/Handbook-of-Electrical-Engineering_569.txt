For an input signal of small amplitude the output faithfully follows the input, whereas for large-amplitude
signals the output is distorted; a ï¬‚attening occurs at the negative peak value. The distortion in amplitude results
in the output having frequency components that are integer multiples of the input frequency, harmonics, and
this type of distortion is referred to as harmonic distortion.
