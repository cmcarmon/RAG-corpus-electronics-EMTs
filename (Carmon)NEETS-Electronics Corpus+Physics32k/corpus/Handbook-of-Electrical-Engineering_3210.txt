3. Fixed-frequency operation.  To overcome some of the problems associated with the variable frequency
control of resonant converters, they are operated with ﬁxed frequency [Sum, 1988; Bhat, 1992]. A number
of conﬁgurations and control methods for ﬁxed-frequency operation are available in the literature (Bhat
[1992]  gives  a  list  of  papers).  One  of  the  most  popular  methods  of  control  is  the  phase-shift  control
