The phrase regression test is used to deﬁne the testing of an evolving software product to ensure that existing
capabilities have not been damaged or degraded as a by-product of adding new capabilities. Regression testing
is normally carried out using test cases created for earlier releases, or at least created earlier in the development
cycle of the current release. The observed removal efﬁciency of regression testing against the speciﬁc class of
errors  that  it  targets  may  exceed  50%  when  carried  out  by  sophisticated  organizations  such  as  computer
manufacturers or defense contractors. However, efﬁciencies in the 20 to 25% range are more common.
