High pressure torsion (HPT) can be traced back to the experiments that won Percy Bridgman the 1946 Nobel Prize in Physics, though its use in metal processing is considerably more recent. In this method, a disk of the material to be strained is placed between 2 anvils. A large compressive stress (typically several gigapascals) is applied, while one anvil is rotated to create a torsion force. HPT can be performed unconstrained, in which the material is free to flow outward, fully constrained, or to some degree between in which outward flow is allowed, but limited.
