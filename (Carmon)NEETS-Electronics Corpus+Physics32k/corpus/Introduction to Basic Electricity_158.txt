In	metallurgical	engineering,	a	term	named	flux	is	commonly	used;	in	circuit
engineering,	as	soon	as	the	circuit	creation	process	commences,	it	will	be
introduced,	too.	It	is	cleaning	agent	and	a	flowing	material	that	facilitates	the
soldering	process.	Should	there	be	invisible	impurities	(e.g.	oil,	dirt,	etc.),	they
will	be	removed	for	the	purpose	of	not	risking	the	integrity	of	a	circuit.
Moreover,	it	is	important	to	note	that	in	soldering,	the	proper	application	of
flux	is	suggested.	Improper	methods	can	result	to	joint	failure.	The	systemâ€™s
damage	(due	to	incorrect	flux	application)	may	not	be	obvious	at	first,	but
gradually,	it	is	capable	of	corrosion	and	rendering	a	circuit	useless.
