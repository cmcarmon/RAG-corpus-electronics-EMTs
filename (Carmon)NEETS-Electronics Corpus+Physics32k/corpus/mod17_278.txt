As shown in figure 2-31, an electromagnet may be used in place of a permanent magnet to form an
electromagnetic dynamic speaker. When we do this, sufficient dc power must be available to energize the
field electromagnet. The operation otherwise is much the same as that of the permanent magnet type. This
type of speaker is seldom used in Navy equipment.
