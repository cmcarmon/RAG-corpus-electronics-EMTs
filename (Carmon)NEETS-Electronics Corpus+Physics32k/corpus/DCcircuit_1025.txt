Quite simple and elegant, donâ€™t you think? It must be noted, though, that the Superposition
Theorem works only for circuits that are reducible to series/parallel combinations for each of
the power sources at a time (thus, this theorem is useless for analyzing an unbalanced bridge
circuit), and it only works where the underlying equations are linear (no mathematical powers
or roots). The requisite of linearity means that Superposition Theorem is only applicable for
determining voltage and current, not power!!! Power dissipations, being nonlinear functions,
do not algebraically add to an accurate total when only one source is considered at a time. The
need for linearity also means this Theorem cannot be applied in circuits where the resistance
of a component changes with voltage or current. Hence, networks containing components like
lamps (incandescent or gas-discharge) or varistors could not be analyzed.
