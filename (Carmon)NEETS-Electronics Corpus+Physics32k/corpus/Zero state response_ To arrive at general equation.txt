The circuit to the right acts as a simple integrator circuit and will be used to verify the equation

{\displaystyle y(t)=\int _{t_{0}}^{t}f(\tau )d\tau \,}

Capacitors have the current-voltage relation

{\displaystyle i(t)=C{\frac {dv}{dt}}}
where C is the capacitance, measured in farads, of the capacitor.
By manipulating the above equation the capacitor can be shown to effectively integrate the current through it. The resulting equation also demonstrates the zero state and zero input responses to the integrator circuit.
First, by integrating both sides of the above equation

{\displaystyle \int _{a}^{b}i(t)dt=\int _{a}^{b}C{\frac {dv}{dt}}dt.}

Second, by integrating the right side

{\displaystyle \int _{a}^{b}i(t)dt=C[v(b)-v(a)].}

Third, distribute and subtract

{\displaystyle Cv(b)=Cv(a)+\int _{a}^{b}i(t)dt.}

Fourth, divide by

{\displaystyle v(b)=v(a)+{\frac {1}{C}}\int _{a}^{b}i(t)dt.}

By substituting

{\displaystyle t\,}
for

{\displaystyle b\,}
and

for

and by using the dummy variable

{\displaystyle \tau \,}
as the variable of integration the general equation
