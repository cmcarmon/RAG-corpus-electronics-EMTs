that  of  simply 
time 
constant. This can be achieved either by increasing 
the  value  of  C1 or  by  increasing  the  resistance 
value  of  RL. In  practice,  however,  the  latter  is  not 
really  an  option  because  RL is  the  effective 
resistance  of  the  circuit  being  supplied  and  we 
don’t  usually  have 
it! 
Increasing  the  value  of  C1 is  a  more  practical 
alternative and very large capacitor values (often in 
excess of 4,700 µF) are typical.     
  Figure  6.8  shows  a  further  refinement  of  the 
simple  power  supply  circuit.  This  circuit  employs 
two  additional  components,  R1 and  C1, which  act 
as a filter to remove the ripple. The value of C1 is 
chosen so that the component exhibits a negligible 
reactance at the ripple frequency (50 Hz for a half-
wave rectifier or 100 Hz for a full-wave rectifier—
see later). In effect, R1 and C1 act like a potential 
divider.  The  amount  of  ripple  is  reduced  by  an 
approximate factor equal to:
