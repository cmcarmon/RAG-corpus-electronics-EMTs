Tegmark et al. have recently considered these objections and proposed a simplified anthropic scenario for axion dark matter in which they argue that the first two of these problems do not apply.
Vilenkin and collaborators have proposed a consistent way to define the probabilities for a given vacuum.
A problem with many of the simplified approaches people have tried is that they "predict" a cosmological constant that is too large by a factor of 10â€“1000 (depending on one's assumptions) and hence suggest that the cosmic acceleration should be much more rapid than is observed.
