Study the schematic shown in view B. Although this schematic is identical to the other shunt voltage 
schematics previously illustrated and discussed, the output voltage is different. The load current has 
increased causing a momentary drop in voltage output to 6.2 volts. Recall that the circuit was designed to 
ensure a constant output voltage of 6.3 volts. Since the output voltage is less than that required, changes 
occur in the regulator to restore the output to 6.3 volts. Because of the 0.1 volt drop in the output voltage, 
the forward bias of Q1 is now 0.6 volt. This decrease in the forward bias increases the resistance of the 
transistor, thereby reducing the current flow through Q1 by the same amount that the load current 
increased. The current flow through RS returns to its normal value and restores the output voltage to 6.3 
volts.
