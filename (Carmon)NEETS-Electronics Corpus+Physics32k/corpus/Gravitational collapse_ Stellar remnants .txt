At what is called the death of the star (when a star has burned out its fuel supply), it will undergo a contraction that can be halted only if it reaches a new state of equilibrium. Depending on the mass during its lifetime, these stellar remnants can take one of three forms:
White dwarfs, in which gravity is opposed by electron degeneracy pressure
Neutron stars, in which gravity is opposed by neutron degeneracy pressure and short-range repulsive neutronâ€“neutron interactions mediated by the strong force
Black hole, in which there is no force strong enough to resist gravitational collapse
