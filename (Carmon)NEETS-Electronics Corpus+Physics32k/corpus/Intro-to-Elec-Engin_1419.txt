The YAGI-UDA array of Figure 15.1.7(d) is commonly used for television reception. It is
usually seen with 3 to 12 elements, although even 40 elements are sometimes employed. Design
frequencies from 100 to 1000 MHz are typical. A half-wave or folded half-wave dipole is the
active element. The array consists of parallel dipoles, all lying in the same plane. The reﬂector,
which reﬂects waves back toward the active element, enhances radiation in the axis of the array
