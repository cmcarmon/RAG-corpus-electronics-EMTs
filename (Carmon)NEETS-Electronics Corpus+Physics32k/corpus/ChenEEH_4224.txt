(2) A station drops its claim after transmitting its claim
token and then hears anything transmitted on the bus;
otherwise, it tries to claim a token at the next iteration
with the next two address bits. A station uses all of its
address bits; if the station succeeds on the last iter-
ation, it is considered a token holder.
