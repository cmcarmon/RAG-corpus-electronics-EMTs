There is evidence showing that the amplitude distribution of the EEG often deviates from gaussian behavior.
It has been reported, for example, that the EEG of humans involved in the performance of mental arithmetic
task exhibits signiﬁcant nongaussian behavior. In addition, the degree of deviation from gaussian behavior of
the  EEG  has  been  shown  to  depend  to  the  behavioral  state,  with  the  state  of  slow-wave  sleep  showing  less
gaussian behavior than quiet waking, which is less gaussian than rapid eye movement (REM) sleep [Ning and
Bronzino, 1989a,b]. Nonlinear signal-processing algorithms such as bispectral analysis are therefore necessary
to address nongaussian and nonlinear behavior of the EEG in order to better describe it in the frequency domain.
