• A current-carrying wire will experience an induced voltage along its length if the current
changes (thus changing the magnetic ﬁeld ﬂux perpendicular to the wire, thus inducing
voltage according to Faraday’s formula). A device built speciﬁcally to take advantage of
this effect is called an inductor.
