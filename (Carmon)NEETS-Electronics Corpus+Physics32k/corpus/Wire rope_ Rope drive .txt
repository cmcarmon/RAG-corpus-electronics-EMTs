There are technical regulations for the rope drives of cranes, elevators, rope ways and mining installations not exceeding a given tensile force and not falling short of a given diameter ratio D/d of sheave and rope diameters. A general dimensioning method of rope drives (and used besides the technical regulations) calculate the five limits
Working cycles up to rope discarding or breakage (mean or 10% limit) - Requirement of the user
Donandt force (yielding tensile force for a given bending diameter ratio D/d) - strict limit. The nominal rope tensile force S must be smaller than the Donandt force SD1.
Rope safety factor = minimum breaking force Fmin / nominal rope tensile force S. (ability to resist extreme impact forces) - Fmin/S ≥ 2,5 for simple lifting appliance
Discarding number of wire breaks (detection to need rope replacement) Minimum number of wire breaks on a reference rope length of 30d should be BA30 ≥ 8 for lifting appliance
Optimal rope diameter with the max. rope endurance for a given sheave diameter D and tensile rope force S - For economic reasons the rope diameter should be near to but smaller than the optimal rope diameter d ≤ dopt.
The calculation of the rope drive limits depends on:
Data of the used wire rope
Rope tensile force S
Diameter D of sheave and/or drum
Simple bendings per working cycle w-sim
Reverse bendings per working cycle w-rev
Combined fluctuating tension and bending per working cycle w-com
Relative fluctuating tensile force deltaS/S
