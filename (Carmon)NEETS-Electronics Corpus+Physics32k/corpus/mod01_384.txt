Figure 2-8 depicts a battery network supplying power to a load requiring both a voltage and a current 
greater than one cell can provide. To provide the required 4.5 volts, groups of three 1.5-volt cells are 
connected in series. To provide the required 1/2 ampere of current, four series groups are connected in 
parallel, each supplying 1/8 ampere of current.
