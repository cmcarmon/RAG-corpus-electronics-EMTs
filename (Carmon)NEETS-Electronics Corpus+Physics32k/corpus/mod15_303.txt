The gyroscope, commonly called a GYRO, has existed since the first electron was sent spinning on 
its axis. Electrons spin and show all the characteristics of a gyro; so does the Earth, which spins about its 
polar axis at over 1000 miles per hour at the Equator. The Earth's rotation about its axis provides the 
stabilizing effect that keeps the North Pole pointed within one degree of Polaris (the North Star).
