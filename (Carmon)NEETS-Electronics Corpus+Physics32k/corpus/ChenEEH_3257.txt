In general, capacitor banks are installed near load points. If
only ﬁxed-type capacitors are installed, the utility will experi-
ence an excessive leading power factor and voltage rise at that
feeder. Therefore, some of the capacitors are installed as
switched-capacitor banks so they can be switched off during
light-load conditions. Because of this, the ﬁxed capacitors are
sized for light load and connected permanently. The switched
capacitors can be switched as a block or in several consecutive
steps as the reactive load becomes greater from light-load level
to peak load and sized accordingly.
