In a study conducted by Curt Covey et al., it was found that an asteroid about 10 km (6.2 mi) in diameter with the explosive force of about 108 MT could send upward of about 2.5x1015 kg of 1 µm (1 micrometer) sized aerosol particles into the atmosphere. Anything larger would fall quickly back to the surface. These particles would then be spread throughout the atmosphere and absorb or refract the sunlight before it is able to reach the surface, cooling the planet in a similar fashion as the sulfurous aerosol rising from a megavolcano, producing deep global dimming. This is controversially purported to have occurred following the Toba eruption.
These pulverized rock particles would remain in the atmosphere until dry deposition, and due to their size, they would also act as cloud condensation nuclei and would be washed out by wet deposition/precipitation, but even then, about 15% of the sun's radiation might not reach the surface. After the first 20 days, the land temperature might drop quickly, by about 13° C. After about a year, the temperature could rebound by about 6° C, but by this time about one-third of the Northern Hemisphere might be covered in ice.
However, this effect could be largely mitigated, even reversed, by a release of enormous quantities of water vapor and carbon dioxide caused by the initial global heat pulse after the impact. If the asteroid hit an ocean (which would be the case with the majority of impact events), water vapor would form the majority of any ejected matter, and would likely result in a major greenhouse effect and a net increase in temperature.
If the impact event is sufficiently energetic it can cause mantle plume (volcanism) at the antipodal point (the opposite side of the world). This volcanism could alone therefore create a volcanic winter, irrespective of the other impact effects.
