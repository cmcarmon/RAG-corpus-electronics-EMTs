This is another of Maxwell’s equations and shows a spatially changing magnetic ﬁeld produces a time-changing
electric ﬁeld. The latter dD/dt can be treated as an electric current which ﬂows through a dielectric, e.g., in a
capacitor,  when  an  alternating  potential  is  applied  across  the  plates.  This  current  is  called  the  displacement
current to distinguish it from the conduction current which ﬂows in conductors. The conduction current involves
the  movement  of  electrons  from  one  electrode  to  the  other  through  the  conductor  (usually  a  metal).  The
displacement current involves no translation of electrons or holes but rather an alternating polarization through-
out the dielectric material which is between the plates of the capacitor.
