Consider the electron (mass me) and proton (mass mp) in the hydrogen atom. They orbit each other about a common centre of mass, a two body problem. To analyze the motion of the electron, a one-body problem, the reduced mass replaces the electron mass

{\displaystyle m_{e}\rightarrow {\frac {m_{e}m_{p}}{m_{e}+m_{p}}}}

and the proton mass becomes the sum of the two masses

This idea is used to set up the Schrödinger equation for the hydrogen atom.
