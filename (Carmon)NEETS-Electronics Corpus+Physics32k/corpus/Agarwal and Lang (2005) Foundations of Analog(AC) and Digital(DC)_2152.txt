The fact that the current through RL is independent of the value of RL
suggests that the Op Amp circuit looks like a current source. It is a simple
matter to verify this more formally: Replace RL by a test source, and find the
Th√©venin output resistance of the circuit. In this case we choose a test current
source it, as in Figure 15.16:
