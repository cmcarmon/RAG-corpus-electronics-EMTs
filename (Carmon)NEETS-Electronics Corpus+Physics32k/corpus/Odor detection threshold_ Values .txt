The threshold value is the concentration an aroma or taste can be detected (air, water and fat).
The recognition threshold or arousal threshold of olfactory neurons is the concentration at which you can identify an odor (air, water and fat).
The odour activity value is the concentration divided by the threshold.
The flavor impact is the value the rate of change in perception with concentration.
The flavor contribution of an aroma component in a mixture to the total profile can be calculated from the total odor units and the number contributed by that aroma chemical.
