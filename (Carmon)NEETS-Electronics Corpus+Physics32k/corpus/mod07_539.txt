Figure 4-44 shows the schematic for a half-wave voltage doubler. Notice the similarities between 
this schematic and those of half-wave voltage rectifiers. In fact, the doubler shown is made up of two 
half-wave voltage rectifiers. C1 and CR1 make up one half-wave rectifier, and C2 and CR2 make up the 
other. The schematic of the first half-wave rectifier is indicated by the dark lines in view A of figure 4-45. 
The dotted lines and associated components represent the other half-wave rectifier and load resistor.
