The resistance between two terminals of an electrical device or circuit is determined by its current–voltage (I–V) curve (characteristic curve), giving the current



i



{\displaystyle i\,}
through it for any given voltage



v



{\displaystyle v\,}
across it. Most materials, including the ordinary (positive) resistances encountered in electrical circuits, obey Ohm's law; the current through them is proportional to the voltage over a wide range. So the I–V curve of an ohmic resistance is a straight line through the origin with positive slope. The resistance is the ratio of voltage to current, the inverse slope of the line (in I–V graphs where the voltage



v



{\displaystyle v\,}
is the independent variable) and is constant.
Negative resistance occurs in a few nonlinear (nonohmic) devices. In a nonlinear component the I–V curve is not a straight line, so it does not obey Ohm's law. Resistance can still be defined, but the resistance is not constant; it varies with the voltage or current through the device. The resistance of such a nonlinear device can be defined in two ways, which are equal for ohmic resistances:

Static resistance (also called chordal resistance, absolute resistance or just resistance) – This is the common definition of resistance; the voltage divided by the current:

{\displaystyle R_{\mathrm {static} }={v \over i}\,}
.

It is the inverse slope of the line (chord) from the origin through the point on the I–V curve. In a power source, like a battery or electric generator, positive current flows out of the positive voltage terminal, opposite to the direction of current in a resistor, so from the passive sign convention



i



{\displaystyle i\,}
and



v



{\displaystyle v\,}
have opposite signs, representing points lying in the 2nd or 4th quadrant of the I–V plane (diagram right). Thus power sources formally have negative static resistance (

.


{\displaystyle R_{\text{static}}\;<\;0).}
However this term is never used in practice, because the term "resistance" is only applied to passive components. Static resistance determines the power dissipation in a component. Passive devices, which consume electric power, have positive static resistance; while active devices, which produce electric power, do not.
Differential resistance (also called dynamic, or incremental resistance) – This is the derivative of the voltage with respect to the current; the ratio of a small change in voltage to the corresponding change in current, the inverse slope of the I–V curve at a point:

{\displaystyle r_{\mathrm {diff} }={\frac {dv}{di}}\,}
.

Differential resistance is only relevant to time-varying currents. Points on the curve where the slope is negative (declining to the right), meaning an increase in voltage causes a decrease in current, have negative differential resistance (

0


{\displaystyle r_{\text{diff}}\;<\;0}
). Devices of this type can amplify signals, and are what is usually meant by the term "negative resistance".
Negative resistance, like positive resistance, is measured in ohms.
Conductance is the reciprocal of resistance. It is measured in siemens (formerly mho) which is the conductance of a resistor with a resistance of one ohm. Each type of resistance defined above has a corresponding conductance

It can be seen that the conductance has the same sign as its corresponding resistance: a negative resistance will have a negative conductance while a positive resistance will have a positive conductance.
