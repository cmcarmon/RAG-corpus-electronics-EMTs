The  signal  restoration  theorem  ensures  that  the  composite  data  matrix  sequence  (14.147)  will  contain  a
subsequence that converges to a composite data matrix which satisﬁes the prerequisite block Toeplitz–nullity
s attributes. The recursive coefﬁcient vectors as speciﬁed by (14.145) when applied to the convergent composite
data matrix will typically give a satisfactory model of the data. It should be noted that in some applications it
is known that either the excitation or the response data is accurate and should not be perturbed when applying
the  operator  P(p+q+2–s).  This  is  readily  accomplished  by  inserting  the  original  block  after  the  rank  reduction
projection mapping P(p+q+2–s) has been applied to Dk–1. This is illustrated in the following numerical example.
