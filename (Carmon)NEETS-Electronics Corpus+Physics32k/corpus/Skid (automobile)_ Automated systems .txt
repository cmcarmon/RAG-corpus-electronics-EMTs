Electronic stability control or ESC systems, and the older Anti-lock brake or ABS systems, perform an automated braking (and for ESC, steering) function using wheel-by-wheel rapid brake pumping, similar to a mixture of threshold and cadence braking on a tire by tire basis.
ABS senses wheel rotation compared to ground velocity, and if the wheel starts to lock up or slip will then rapidly moderate the brakes to let it begin to rotate again. This is done separately for all 4 wheels, and without regard for the rotation of the vehicle.
ESC does the same, but combines that with sensing the steering and yaw or rotation velocity of the vehicle (for example, rotating as it goes around a corner). ESC will go beyond simply avoiding lockup in each tire, to dynamically braking other tires to maintain the existing path of the vehicle.
