The cartridge fuse operates exactly like the plug-type fuse. In the cartridge fuse, the fuse link is
enclosed in a tube of insulating material with metal ferrules at each end (for contact with the fuse holder).
Some common insulating materials are glass, bakelite, or a fiber tube filled with insulating powder.
