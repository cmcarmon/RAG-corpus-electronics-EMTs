Upon writing the most general Lagrangian with massless neutrinos, one finds that the dynamics depend on 19 parameters, whose numerical values are established by experiment. Straightforward extensions of Standard Model with massive neutrinos need 7 more parameters, 3 masses and 4 PMNS matrix parameters, for a total of 26 parameters. The neutrino parameter values are still uncertain. The 19 certain parameters are summarized here.
The choice of free parameters is somewhat arbitrary. In the table above, gauge couplings are listed as free parameters, therefore with this choice Weinberg angle is not a free parameter - it is defined as

Instead of fermion masses, dimensionless Yukawa couplings can be chosen as free parameters. For example, electron mass depends on the Yukawa coupling of electron to Higgs field, and its value is
