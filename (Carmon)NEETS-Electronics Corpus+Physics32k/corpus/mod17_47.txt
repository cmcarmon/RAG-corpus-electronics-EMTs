Radiotelegraph transmissions are referred to as continuous wave (cw) telegraphy. Cw is a manual or 
automatic system of transmitting signals using a wave of radio-frequency (rf) energy. The radio operator 
separates a continuously transmitted wave into dots and dashes based on the Morse code. This is 
accomplished by opening and closing a telegraphic hand key.
