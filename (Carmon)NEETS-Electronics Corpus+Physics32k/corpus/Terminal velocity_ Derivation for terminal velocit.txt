Using mathematical terms, defining down to be positive, the net force acting on an object falling near the surface of Earth is (according to the drag equation):

{\displaystyle F_{net}=ma=mg-{1 \over 2}\rho v^{2}AC_{d},}

with v(t) the velocity of the object as a function of time t.
At equilibrium, the net force is zero (Fnet = 0) and the velocity becomes the terminal velocity limt→∞ v(t) = Vt:
