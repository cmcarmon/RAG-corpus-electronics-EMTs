Temperature coefﬁcient (TC): A capacitor’s change in capacitance per degree change in temperature. May
be positive, negative, or zero and is usually expressed in parts per million per degree Celsius (ppm/(cid:176)C)
if the characteristics are linear. For nonlinear types, TC is expressed as a percentage of room temperature
(25(cid:176)C)capacitance.
