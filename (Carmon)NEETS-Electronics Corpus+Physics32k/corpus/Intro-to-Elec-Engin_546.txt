The slow speed of operation, caused by the long time required for changes in state to ripple
through the ﬂip-ﬂops, is a disadvantage of ripple counters. This problem is overcome by using
synchronous converters. However, additional control logic is needed to determine which ﬂip-
ﬂops, if any, must change state, since ﬂip-ﬂops are triggered simultaneously. Figure 6.2.6 shows
the logic diagram of a 3-bit binary synchronous converter using JKFFs. Synchronous counters
can be designed to cycle through any sequence of states. Various n-bit synchronous converters
are commercially available as MSI packages. Some counters are also programmable.
