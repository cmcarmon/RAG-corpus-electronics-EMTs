Class Inheritance Relation
Another major feature of the OO paradigm is class inheri-
tance relation that captures the generalization–specialization
relationships in the real world (Coad and Yourdon, 1991). A
class inheritance relationship exists between a superclass and a
subclass such that the subclass inherits data structures as well
as operation deﬁnitions from the superclass without the need
to deﬁne them again. Thus, class inheritance relation supports
a ﬂexible and manageable way to reuse existing data structures
and operations.
