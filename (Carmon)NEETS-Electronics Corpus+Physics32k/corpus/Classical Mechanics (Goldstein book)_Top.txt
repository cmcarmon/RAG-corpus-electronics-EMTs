Classical Mechanics is a textbook about the subject of that name written by Herbert Goldstein. Intended for advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students, it has been one of the standard references in its subject around the world since its first publication in 1951.
Before the death of its primary author in 2005, a new (third) edition of the book was released, with the collaboration of Charles P. Poole and John L. Safko. In the third edition, the book discusses at length various mathematically sophisticated reformations of Newtonian mechanics, namely analytical mechanics, as applied to particles, rigid bodies and continua. In addition, it covers in some detail classical electromagnetism, special relativity, classical and relativistic field theory, chaos theory and fractal geometry. A brief discussion on general relativity is also included. There is an appendix on group theory.
