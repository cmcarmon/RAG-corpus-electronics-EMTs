information  embedded  in  the  modulated  data  stream.  The  delay  performance  of  this  channel  is  essentially
controlled by the queuing behavior of the hub. In the VSAT-to-hub direction, a large number of VSATs share
the channel to conserve space segment. Most VSAT networks utilize a combination of slotted ALOHA protocol
for the interactive component of the inbound trafﬁc and a reservation TDMA scheme for any bulk data transfers.
Most  protocols  are  adaptive  in  the  sense  that  as  the  channel  trafﬁc  increases,  they  automatically  evolve  into
reservation TDMA systems. Code division multiple access (CDMA) has been used in VSATs operating at C-band.
CDMA  permits  more  than  one  signal  to  simultaneously  utilize  the  channel  bandwidth  in  a  noninterfering
manner. This makes it possible to signiﬁcantly increase the utilization and throughput of the channel.
