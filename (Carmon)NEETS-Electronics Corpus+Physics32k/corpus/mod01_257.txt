the actual value of the resistor may fall somewhere within 10 percent above and 10 percent below the
value indicated by the color code. This resistor has an indicated value of 27,000 ohms. Its tolerance is 10
percent x 27,000 ohms, or 2,700 ohms. Therefore, the resistorâ€™s actual value is somewhere between
24,300 ohms and 29,700 ohms.
