The simple, single-tube transmitter, shown in figure 1-28, is rarely used in practical equipment. Most 
of the transmitters you will see use a number of tubes or stages. The number used depends on the 
frequency, power, and application of the equipment. For your study, the following three categories of cw 
transmitters are discussed: (1) master oscillator power amplifier (mopa) transmitters, (2) multistage, 
high-power transmitters, (3) high- and very-high frequency transmitters.
