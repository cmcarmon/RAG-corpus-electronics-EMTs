Conventional current is the flow of a posi-
tive charge from positive to negative and 
is the reverse of real electron flow. (See 
Figure 3-5.) All descriptions of electronic 
circuits use conventional current, so if 
you see an arrow depicting current flow 
in a circuit diagram, you know it is show-
ing the direction of conventional current 
flow. In electronics, the symbol I repre-
sents conventional current, measured in 
amperes (or amps, abbreviated A). You’re 
more likely to encounter milliamps (mA) 
in circuits you build at home. A milliamp 
is one one‐thousandth of an amp.
