Chaotic signals are nonperiodic waveforms, generated by deterministic systems, which are characterized by a
continuous “noise-like” broad power spectrum [2]. In the time domain, chaotic signals appear “random.” Chaotic
systems are characterized by “sensitive dependence on initial conditions”; an arbitrarily small perturbation even-
tually  causes  a  large  change  in  the  state  of  the  system.  Equivalently,  chaotic  signals  decorrelate  rapidly  with
themselves. The autocorrelation function of a chaotic signal has a large peak at zero and decays rapidly.
