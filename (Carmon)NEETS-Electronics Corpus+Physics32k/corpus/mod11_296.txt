Microwaves travel in straight lines as do light rays. They can also be focused and reflected just as 
light rays can, as illustrated by the antenna shown in figure 3-2. A microwave source is placed at focal 
point F. The field leaves this antenna as a spherical wavefront. As each part of the wavefront reaches the 
reflecting surface, it is phase-shifted 180 degrees. Each part is then sent outward at an angle that results in 
all parts of the field traveling in parallel paths. Because of the special shape of a parabolic surface, all 
paths from F to the reflector and back to line XY are the same length. Therefore, when the parts of the 
field are reflected from the parabolic surface, they travel to line XY in the same amount of time.
