The differential voltmeter uses a built-in NULL DETECTOR to measure an unknown voltage. The
meter circuitry compares the unknown voltage to a known, adjustable reference voltage supplied by the
meter. The reference voltage is provided by a high-voltage dc power supply and decade resistor divider
assembly strings that are set by voltage readout dials. In this way, the output from the high-voltage power
supply can be precisely divided into increments as small as 10 microvolts. The readout dials are used to
adjust the meter pointer to 0 and the unknown voltage is then read from the voltage dials.
