The electronic counter was once a piece of  laboratory 
equipment but is now used in  electronics repair shops, 
engineering departments, and ham-radio shacks, and 
on industrial production lines. The wide use of the 
counter can be attributed to the integrated circuit, 
which has reduced the size and price of the counter 
while  increasing its accuracy, stability, reliability, and 
frequency range. (Integrated circuits are discussed in 
Section 4.)
