There’s an unwritten rule in electronics about how to orient certain parts of 
a circuit schematic — especially when drawing diagrams of complex circuits. 
Batteries and other power supplies are almost always oriented vertically, 
with the positive terminal on top. In complex schematics, power supplies are 
split between two symbols (as you will see later), but the positive terminal 
is usually shown at the top of the schematic (sometimes extending across 
a horizontal line, or rail) and the negative terminal appears at the bottom 
(sometimes along a rail). Inputs are commonly shown on the left and outputs 
on the right.
