In analog to digital and digital to analog conversion of signals, the sampling is normally assumed to be periodic with a fixed periodâ€”the time between every two samples is the same. If there is jitter present on the clock signal to the analog-to-digital converter or a digital-to-analog converter, the time between samples varies and instantaneous signal error arises. The error is proportional to the slew rate of the desired signal and the absolute value of the clock error. Various effects such as noise (random jitter), or spectral components (periodic jitter) can come about depending on the pattern of the jitter in relation to the signal. In some conditions, less than a nanosecond of jitter can reduce the effective bit resolution of a converter with a Nyquist frequency of 22 kHz to 14 bits.
This is a consideration in high-frequency signal conversion, or where the clock signal is especially prone to interference.
