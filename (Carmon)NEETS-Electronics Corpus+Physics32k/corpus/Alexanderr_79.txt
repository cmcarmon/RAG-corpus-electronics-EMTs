Series Resistors and Voltage Division
The  need  to  combine  resistors  in  series  or  in  parallel  occurs  so  fre-
quently that it warrants special attention. The process of combining the
resistors  is  facilitated  by  combining  two  of  them  at  a  time.  With  this
in mind, consider the single-loop circuit of Fig. 2.29. The two resistors
