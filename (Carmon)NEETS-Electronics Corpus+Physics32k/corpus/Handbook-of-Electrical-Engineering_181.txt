Standardâ€”Class H
In North America, Standard or Class H fuses are available in 250- and 600-V ratings with ampere ratings up
to 600 A. There are primarily three types: one-time, time-delay, and renewable. Rating for rating, they are all
constructed to the same dimensions and are physically interchangeable in standard-type fusible switches and
fuse blocks.
