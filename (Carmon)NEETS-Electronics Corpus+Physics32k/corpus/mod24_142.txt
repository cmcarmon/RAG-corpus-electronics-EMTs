Before we progress, let us refer back to figure 2-17. Notice that the modes are not confined to the
core of the fiber. The modes extend partially into the cladding material. Low-order modes penetrate the
cladding only slightly. In low-order modes, the electric and magnetic fields are concentrated near the
center of the fiber. However, high-order modes penetrate further into the cladding material. In high-order
modes, the electrical and magnetic fields are distributed more toward the outer edges of the fiber.
