An EMP has a smaller effect, the shorter the length of an electrical conductor; though other factors affect the vulnerability of electronics as well, so there is no one cutoff length that determines whether some piece of equipment will survive. However, small electronic devices, such as wristwatches and cell phones, would most likely withstand an EMP.
