Surgery
A pacemaker implant is a fairly standard procedure in which the pacing leads are inserted intravenously into
the heart and the pacemaker is implanted subcutaneously in a pocket on the chest just below the clavicle. A
number of veins have been used to implant the leads, but the cephalic and the subclavian veins are the most
common. Access to either of these veins is obtained from the same incision that is used to form the pocket on
the chest. A number of tools, such as guidewires, dilator sheaths, and ﬂuoroscopy (real time X-ray), are used
to work the lead down the veins into position in the right side of the heart. Depending on the type of pacemaker
used, one or two leads may be implanted. In dual-chamber pacemakers, a lead is required in both the ventricles
and the atria. Figure 115.12 shows a diagram of a typical dual-chamber system in the body. The right ventricular
lead is usually implanted ﬁrst and is advanced to the right ventricular apex, where it is ﬁxed. The atrial lead is
then advanced to the right atrial appendage, where it is also ﬁxed. A pacing system analyzer is used to test for
sufﬁcient  electrode  contact  by  measuring  impedance,  pacing  thresholds,  and  sensing  thresholds.  The  pacing
threshold is the smallest charge necessary to stimulate cardiac tissue and initiate a depolarizing wavefront. The
