International scientific collaborations install large neutrino detectors near nuclear reactors or in neutrino beams from particle accelerators to better constrain the neutrino masses and the values for the magnitude and rates of oscillations between neutrino flavors. These experiments are thereby searching for the existence of CP violation in the neutrino sector; that is, whether or not the laws of physics treat neutrinos and antineutrinos differently.
The KATRIN experiment in Germany will begin to acquire data in 2017 to determine the value of the mass of the electron neutrino, with other approaches to this problem in the planning stages.
