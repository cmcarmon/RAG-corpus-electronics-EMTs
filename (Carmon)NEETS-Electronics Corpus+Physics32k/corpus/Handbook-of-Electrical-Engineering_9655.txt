I have been hearing for the past 15 years about the demise of the operating system. It has been said over and
 on the role the operating
over that the role of the OS will go away. So far, the only change has been to 
system  plays.  One  must  remember  that  the  operating  system  is  not  the  user  interface  it  portrays  or  the
applications that run on it. It is, as it always has been, the manager of all resources on a computer system.
