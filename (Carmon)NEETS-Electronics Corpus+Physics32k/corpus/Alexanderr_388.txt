A solenoid with resistance 
and inductance 6 mH is used in an auto-
mobile  ignition  circuit  similar  to  that  in  Fig.  7.78.  If  the  battery  sup-
plies 12 V, determine: the Ô¨Ånal current through the solenoid when the
switch  is  closed,  the  energy  stored  in  the  coil,  and  the  voltage  across
the air gap, assuming that the switch takes
