where  lo =  1/( f 
)  is  the  wavelength  of  a  plane  wave  of  the  same  frequency  in  an  inﬁnite  sample  of  the
waveguide dielectric. For f >> fc , lg » lo. Also, lg ﬁ ¥  as f ﬁ fc , which is one reason why it is usually undesirable
to operate a waveguide mode near modal cut-off frequencies.
