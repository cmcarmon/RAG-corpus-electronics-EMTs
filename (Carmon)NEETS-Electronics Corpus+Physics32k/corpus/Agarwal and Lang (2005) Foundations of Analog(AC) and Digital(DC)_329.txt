Resistors in parallel occur as commonly as resistors in series. Two resistors in
parallel are shown in Figures 2.37 and 2.39.
Our preceding analysis shows that the two resistors in parallel act as a
single resistor RP having a conductance GP (where GP = 1/RP) equal to the
sum of the two individual conductances. In other words, parallel conductances
add:
