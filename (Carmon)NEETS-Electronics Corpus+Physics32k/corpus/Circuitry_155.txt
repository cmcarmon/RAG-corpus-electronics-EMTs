Charging 
 
A simple C–R circuit is shown in Fig. 3.26 . In this 
circuit  C is  charged  through  R from  the  constant 
voltage  source,  Vs. The  voltage,  vc, across  the 
(initially  uncharged)  capacitor  voltage  will  rise 
exponentially  as  shown  in  Fig.  3.27.  At  the  same 
time, the current in the circuit, i, will fall, as shown 
in Fig. 3.28. 
  The  rate  of  growth  of  voltage  with  time  (and 
decay of current with time) will be dependent upon 
the  product  of  capacitance  and  resistance.  This 
value is known as the time  constant of the circuit. 
Hence: 
 
Time constant,  t = C × R
where  C  is  the  value  of  capacitance  (F),  R is  the 
resistance (F), and t is the time constant (s). 
  The  voltage  developed  across 
the  charging 
capacitor,  vc, varies  with  time,  t, according  to  the 
relationship:
