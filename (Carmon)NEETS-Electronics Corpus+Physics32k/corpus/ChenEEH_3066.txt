If the secondary of the transformer is shorted, the impedance
of the transformer presented to the system is approximately
(R1 þ jXl1) þ (R2 þ jXl2). This is generally referred to as the
impedance of a transformer or its leakage impedance. The R
is the effective resistance of
the primary and secondary
winding and is composed of both dc and skin effect losses.
Generally, R is much smaller than X and normally can be
ignored in practical calculation.
