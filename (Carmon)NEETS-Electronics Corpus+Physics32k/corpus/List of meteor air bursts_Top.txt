Many explosions have been recorded in Earth's atmosphere that are likely caused by the air burst that results from a meteor exploding as it hits the thicker part of the atmosphere. These types of meteors are also known as fireballs or bolides with the brightest known as superbolides. Contrary to smaller and common "shooting stars", these larger meteors were originally asteroids and comets of a few to several tens of meters in diameter before entering Earth's atmosphere.
The best known is the 1908 Tunguska event. The appearance of extremely bright fireballs traveling across the sky is often witnessed from a distance, such as the 1947 Sikhote-Alin meteor and the 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor, both in Russia. If the bolide is large enough, fragments may survive such as the Chelyabinsk meteorite. Modern developments in infrasound detection by the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization and infrared Defense Support Program satellite technology have increased the likelihood of detecting airbursts.
