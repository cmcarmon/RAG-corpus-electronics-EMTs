Members of the class of signal restoration algorithms that are describable by a successive projection operator
are  primarily  distinguished  by  the  restrictions  placed  on  the  attribute  sets.  The  earliest  versions  of  these
algorithms were highly restrictive and required that the attribute sets be closed subspaces. Unfortunately, this
requirement severely limited the types of restoration problems that could be addressed. In recognition of this
limitation, subsequent methods of successive projections algorithms eased the requirements on the attribute
sets to that of being closed convex sets and eventually to the projection operators being closed mappings. This
progression of less restrictive requirements signiÔ¨Åcantly expands the types of signal processing problems that
are amenable to signal restoration by successive projections.
