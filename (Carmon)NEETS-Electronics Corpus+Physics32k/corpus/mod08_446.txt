A simple half-wave magnetic amplifier is shown in figure 3-38. This is a half-wave magnetic
amplifier because it uses a half-wave rectifier. During the first half cycle of the load voltage, the diode
conducts and the load windings develop load flux as shown in view (A) by the dashed-line arrows. The
