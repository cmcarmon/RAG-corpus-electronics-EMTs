Step 2â€”Exposing the PC. The wavelength of the exposing light source must match the spectral sensitivity of
the PC. If the PC is discharged in areas that will be printed white, the overall process is termed charge area
development (CAD); if the discharged area will be printed black (or color), the process is called discharge area
development  (DAD).  Both  CAD  and  DAD  processes  are  used  in  EP  printers  but  CAD  is  the  only  common
process used in copiers.
