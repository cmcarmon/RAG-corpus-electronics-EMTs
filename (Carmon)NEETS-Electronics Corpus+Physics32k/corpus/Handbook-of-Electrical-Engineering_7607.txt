Basic Latches
A latch can be either basic or gated. Figure 79.16 is an example of a basic S-R NOR latch implementation using
two  cross-coupled  NOR  gates.  The  logic  symbol  recommended  for  the  S-R  NOR  latch  by  the  Institute  of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is shown to the right of the logic circuit implementation.
