The voltmeter is used for voltage tests. In using the voltmeter, make certain that the meter used is
designed for the type of current (ac or dc) to be tested and has a scale with a suitable range. Since
defective parts in a circuit can cause higher than normal voltages to be present at the point of test, the
highest voltmeter range available should be used first. Once you have obtained a reading, determine if a
lower scale can be used that will cause no damage to the meter movement. If so, use the lower scale. This
provides a more accurate reading.
