If we take Ω to be constant with respect to time, then vb = 0 and the identity reduces to

{\displaystyle {\frac {d}{dt}}\int _{\Omega }f\,dV=\int _{\Omega }{\frac {\partial f}{\partial t}}\,dV.}

as expected. (This simplification is not possible if the flow velocity is incorrectly used in place of the velocity of an area element.)
