The second advantage stems from the ability to incorporate several different OS environments on top of the
same micro-kernel. In this way, the computer acts as though it is running several operating systems. For example,
if  both  MS-DOS  and  UNIX  coexisted  on  the  same  micro-kernel,  the  user  could  choose  to  run  an  MS-DOS
spreadsheet  or  word  processor  and  communicate  using  UNIX  network  commands.  The  user  has  gained
increased ï¬‚exibility.
