In the MPEG-2 standard, pictures can be interlaced, whereas
in MPEG-1, the pictures are progressive only. The dimensions
of the units of blocks used for motion estimation/compen-
sation can change. Because the number of lines per Ô¨Åeld is half
the number of lines per frame in the interlaced pictures,
for motion estimation it might be appropriate to choose
blocks of 16  8 (i.e., 16 pixels over 8 lines) with equal hori-
zontal and vertical resolutions. The second major difference
between the two is scalability. The scalable modes of MPEG-2
video encoders are intended to offer interoperability among
different services or to accommodate the varying capabilities
of different receivers and networks upon which a single service
