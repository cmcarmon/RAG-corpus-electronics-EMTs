While 50% is a very common definition for CEP, the circle dimension can be defined for percentages. Percentiles can be determined by recognizing that the squared distance defined by two uncorrelated orthogonal Gaussian random variables (one for each axis) is chi-square distributed. Approximate formulae are available to convert the distributions along the two axes into the equivalent circle radius for the specified percentage.
