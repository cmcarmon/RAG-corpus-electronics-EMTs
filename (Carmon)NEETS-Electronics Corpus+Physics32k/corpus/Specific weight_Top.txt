The specific weight (also known as the unit weight) is the weight per unit volume of a material. The symbol of specific weight is γ (the Greek letter Gamma).
A commonly used value is the specific weight of water on Earth at 4°C which is 9.807 kN/m3 or 62.43 lbf/ft3.
The terms specific gravity, and less often specific weight, are also used for relative density.
