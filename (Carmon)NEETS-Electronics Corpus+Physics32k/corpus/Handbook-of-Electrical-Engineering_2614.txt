where the new symbols are deﬁned as follows: QB = depletion-layer charge/unit area due to bulk body dopant
NB in the depletion layer, and qDI = depletion-layer charge/unit area due to implanted ions in the depletion
layer between the inversion-layer edge and the depletion-layer edge. Because even a small increase in fS above
fTH causes a large increase in qNinv, which can balance a rather large change in gate charge or gate voltage, fS
does not increase much as VG – VTH increases. Nonetheless, in strong inversion Ninv » 1012 charges/cm2, so in
strong inversion fS will be about 10 kT/q larger than fTH .
