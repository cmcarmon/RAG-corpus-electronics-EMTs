When light waves, which travel in straight lines, encounter any substance, they are either reflected,
absorbed, transmitted, or refracted. This is illustrated in figure 2-2. Those substances that transmit almost
all the light waves falling upon them are said to be transparent. A transparent substance is one through
which you can see clearly. Clear glass is transparent because it transmits light rays without diffusing them
(view A of figure 2-3). There is no substance known that is perfectly transparent, but many substances are
nearly so. Substances through which some light rays can pass, but through which objects cannot be seen
clearly because the rays are diffused, are called translucent (view B of figure 2-3). The frosted glass of a
light bulb and a piece of oiled paper are examples of translucent materials. Those substances that are
unable to transmit any light rays are called opaque (view C of figure 2-3). Opaque substances either
reflect or absorb all the light rays that fall upon them.
