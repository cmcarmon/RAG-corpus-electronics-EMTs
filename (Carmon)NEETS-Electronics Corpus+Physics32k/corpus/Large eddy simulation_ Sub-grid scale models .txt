Without a universally valid description of turbulence, empirical information must be utilized when constructing and applying SGS models, supplemented with fundamental physical constraints such as Galilean invariance . Two classes of SGS models exist; the first class is functional models and the second class is structural models. Some models may be categorized as both.
