In general, every machine has a nameplate attached to the frame inscribed with relevant
information regarding voltage, current, power, power factor, speed, frequency, phases, and
allowable temperature rise. The nameplate rating is the continuous rating, unless otherwise
speciﬁed, such as short-time rating. Motors are rated in hp (horsepower); dc generators in kW;
and alternators and transformers in terms of kVA rather than kW (because their losses and heating
are approximately determined by the voltage and current, regardless of the power factor). The
physical size and cost of ac power-system apparatus are roughly proportional to the kVA rating.
In order to fully utilize the magnetic properties of the iron and optimize the machine design,
the machine iron is worked at fairly saturated levels of ﬂux density, such that the normal operating
point on the open circuit is near the knee of the open-circuit characteristic (or the no-load
saturation curve, which is similar to the magnetization B–H characteristic). Magnetic saturation
does inﬂuence the machine performance to a considerable degree. Leakage and harmonic ﬂuxes,
which exist in addition to the mutual ﬂux (generally assumed to be sinusoidally distributed) and
which may develop parasitic torques causing vibration and noise, also have to be considered.
Accounting for, and including, these effects becomes too involved to be discussed here.
