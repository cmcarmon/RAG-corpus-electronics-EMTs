Following humane procedures approved by IACUC, the muscle is isolated from the animal (or prepared in situ), attached to the muscle testing apparatus and bathed in oxygenated Ringer's solution or Krebs-Henseleit solution maintained at a constant temperature. While the isolated muscle is still living, the experimenter then applies two manipulations to test muscle function: 1) Electrical stimulation to mimic the action of a motor neuron and 2) strain (muscle length change) to mimic the rhythmic motion of a limb. To elicit muscle contraction, the muscle is stimulated by a series of electrical pulses delivered by an electrode to stimulate either the motor nerve or the muscle tissue itself. Simultaneously, a computer-controlled servo motor in the testing apparatus oscillates the muscle while measuring the force generated by the stimulated muscle. The following parameters are modulated by the experimenter to influence muscle force, work and power output:
Stimulation duration: The time period over which the muscle receives electrical stimulation
Stimulation pulse frequency: The number of stimulation pulses per stimulation duration
Stimulation phase: The time delay between the onset of stimulation and muscle length change
Strain amplitude: The difference between the maximum and minimum values of the length oscillation pattern
Strain frequency: The number of shortening-lengthening periods per time period
