A simple mechanism — consisting of a commutator (a segmented wheel 
with each segment connected to a different end of the electromagnet) and 
brushes that touch the commutator — causes the connections to change. 
The commutator turns with the axle and the brushes are stationary, with one 
brush connected to the positive battery terminal and the other brush to the 
negative battery terminal. As the axle — and (therefore) the  commutator — 
rotates, the segment in contact with each brush changes. This, in turn, 
changes which end of the electromagnet is connected to negative or positive 
voltage.
