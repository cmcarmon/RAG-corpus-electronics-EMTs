10 to 100. The reﬂections at the dielectric–air interface conﬁne
the electromagnetic ﬁelds mainly inside the dielectric region
and its immediate vicinity. The operating principle of a di-
electric resonator is quite similar to that of rectangular or
cylindrical cavity resonators. Calculation of the resonant fre-
quencies is, however, more involved because of the inhomo-
geneous medium in which the electromagnetic wave resonates.
Dielectric resonators can serve two basic functions. One is to
keep the electromagnetic energy away from any metallic
boundary and thus increase the Q factor signiﬁcantly, provided
the dielectric is of low loss (specialized ceramic). The other
function is to reduce the resonator size by approximately
1=
. Specially designed ceramic materials offer excellent
temperature stability and high Q value. Typical values for Q
are in the range of 1,000 to 60,000. In a practical realization, a
dielectric resonator is either enclosed in a metallic cavity
(placed sufﬁciently away from the housing) or, for lower Q
applications, metallized at its surface. A dielectric resonator
can also be used as a drop-in resonator in a planar circuit
(surface-mounted on a metallic surface) or even sandwiched
between two parallel metallic plates. The latter application
prevents to some degree radiation loss and unwanted interfer-
ence with other circuits.
