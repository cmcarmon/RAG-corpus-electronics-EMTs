Another important notion of the zones is to deÔ¨Åne a backup
coverage. This is typical for the transmission line protection
where multiple zones of protection are used for different
sections of the transmission line. Figure 9.5 shows how the
zones may be selected in case three zones of protection are
used by each relay. The zones of protection are selected by
determining the settings of the relay reach and the time
associated with relay operation.
