In laser cooling, the Boltzmann constant times the recoil temperature is equal to the recoil energy deposited in a single atom initially at rest by the spontaneous emission of a single photon. The recoil temperature is

{\displaystyle T_{recoil}={\frac {\hbar ^{2}k^{2}}{2mk_{B}}}}

since the photon's momentum is

{\displaystyle p=\hbar k}

k


{\displaystyle k}
is the wavevector of the light,



m


{\displaystyle m}
is the mass of an atom,

{\displaystyle k_{B}}
is Boltzmann's constant and

{\displaystyle \hbar }
is Planck's constant). The recoil temperature for the D2 lines of alkali atoms is typically on the order of 1 μK, and thus lower than the Doppler temperature. An example of a process where the recoil temperature can be reached is Sisyphus cooling.
