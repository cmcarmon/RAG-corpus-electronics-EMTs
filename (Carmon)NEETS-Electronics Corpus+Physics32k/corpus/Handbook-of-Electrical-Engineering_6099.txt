Apart from the graphical interpretation of results, there are now several good packages that allow the analyst
to enter the data graphically. It is a great advantage to be able to develop a one-line, or three-phase, diagram
of a network directly with the computer. All the relevant system components can be included. Parameter data
still require entry in a more orthodox manner but by merely clicking on a component, a data form for that
component can be made available. The chances of omitting a component are greatly reduced with this type of
data entry. Further, the same system diagram can be used to show the results of some analyses.
