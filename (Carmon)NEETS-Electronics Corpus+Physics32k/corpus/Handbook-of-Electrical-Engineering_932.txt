Device Simulation
Device simulation uses a different approach from that of conventional lumped circuit models to determine the
electrical device characteristics. Whereas with analytic or empirical models all characteristics are determined
by ﬁtting a set of adjustable parameters to measured data, device simulators determine the electrical behavior
by  numerically  solving  the  underlying  set  of  differential  equations.  The  ﬁrst  is  the  Poisson  equation,  which
describes the electrostatic potential within the device
