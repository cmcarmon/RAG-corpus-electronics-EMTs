limiter
,
 whose basic conÔ¨Åguration is shown in Fig. 43.10(d), is an important control component used at
microwave  frequencies. An  ideal  limiter  has  no  attenuation  when  low  power  is  incident  upon  it  but  has  an
attenuation that increases with increasing power (above a threshold level) to maintain constant output power.
Limiters are also used to protect the receivers from other nearby radar transmitters. Schottky and PIN diodes
