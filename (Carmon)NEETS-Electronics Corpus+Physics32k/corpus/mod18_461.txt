The ring time to be expected on a good radar depends on the particular type of radar being tested; on 
the way the echo box is installed - that is, whether a directional coupler or a pickup dipole is used; on the 
length and type of cable used; on the individual ringing ability of the particular echo box in use; on the 
frequency of the radar; and on the temperature of the echo box at the time of the test. Corrections are 
made for all of these factors according to the procedure given in the technical manual for the echo box 
being used.
