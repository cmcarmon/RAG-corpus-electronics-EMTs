The de Broglie relation, also known as the de Broglie's momentum–wavelength relation, generalizes the Planck relation to matter waves. Louis de Broglie argued that if particles had a wave nature, the relation E = hν would also apply to them, and postulated that particles would have a wavelength equal to λ = h/p. Combining de Broglie's postulate with the Planck–Einstein relation leads to




p
=
h



ν
~





{\displaystyle p=h{\tilde {\nu }}}
or




p
=
ℏ
k
.


{\displaystyle p=\hbar k.}

The de Broglie's relation is also often encountered in vector form





p

=
ℏ

k

,


{\displaystyle \mathbf {p} =\hbar \mathbf {k} ,}

where p is the momentum vector, and k is the angular wave vector.
