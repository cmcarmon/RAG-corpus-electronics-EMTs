One of the signatures of the spin Hall magnetoresistance is that the change in resistance is observed when the magnetization of the insulator is rotated with respect to the spin axis and not to the direction of the charge current as is seen in anisotropic magnetoresistance. The change in resistivity follows a squared sine wave pattern when the magnetization vector is rotated about an axis that has a component normal to the spin axis. Platinum has been observed to have maximum resistivity changes of up to 0.12%.
