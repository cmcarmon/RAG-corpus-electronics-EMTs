The director and the reflector in the Yagi antenna are usually welded to a conducting rod or tube at 
their centers. This support does not interfere with the operation of the antenna. Since the driven element is 
center-fed, it is not welded to the supporting rod. The center impedance can be increased by using a 
folded dipole as the driven element.
