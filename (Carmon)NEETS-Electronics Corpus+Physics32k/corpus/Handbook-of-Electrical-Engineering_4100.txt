Intentional  Radiators. There  are  different  limits  on  devices  which  intentionally  radiate  radio  frequency
energy. The authorization procedure required by the Commission is the same as a certiÔ¨Åcation. In addition
to the radiated and conducted emission limits, there are restricted bands of operation in which the devices
may  not  intentionally  radiate  (spurious  emissions  are  permitted  in  these  bands);  these  bands  are  given  in
Table 40.3.
