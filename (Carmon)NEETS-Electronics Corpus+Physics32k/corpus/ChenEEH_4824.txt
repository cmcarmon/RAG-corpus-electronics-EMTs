Polymorphism can be seen in the initialize and the readData
methods, which can apply to any sensor object but require
different implementation depending on the type of sensor. For
this purpose, the subclasses all have these methods deﬁned,
which override the method deﬁned in the superclass. Why then
would you bother to deﬁne these methods in the superclass
when they are deﬁned more speciﬁcally in the subclasses? The
answer lies in the way the methods can be called from the
control algorithm object. As deﬁned, the control algorithm can
group all the sensor objects into one vector; the method call
would only need to be made once (on the vector object), and
each sensor’s appropriate method would be used auto-
the
matically. This demonstrates polymorphism, where
