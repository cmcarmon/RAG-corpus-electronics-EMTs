where Z = impedance, W; R = resistance, W; L = inductance, H; XL = inductive reactance, W; XC = capacitive
reactance, W; and q = phase angle, degrees, by which current leads voltage in a capacitive circuit or lags voltage
in an inductive circuit (0(cid:176) indicates an in-phase condition).
Resonant Frequency
When an inductor and capacitor are connected in series or parallel, they form a resonant circuit. The resonant
frequency can be determined from the equation
