If  the  average  system  experiences  N  failures  during  its  lifetime,  the  total  time  that  the  system  will  be
operational is N(MTTF) hours. Likewise, the total time that the system is down for repairs is N(MTTR) hours.
In other words, the operational time, top, is N(MTTF) hours and the downtime, trepair, is N(MTTR) hours. The
average, or steady-state, availability is
