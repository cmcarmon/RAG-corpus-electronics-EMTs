As you can see, this circuit has maximum resistance (RT) when the individual resistors are of equal
value. If the variable resistors represented impedances and if components could be found that varied their
impedance in the same way as the ganged resistors in figure 2-13, you would have the frequency-
determining network needed for an rf amplifier.
