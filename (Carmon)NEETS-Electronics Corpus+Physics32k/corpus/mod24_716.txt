Receiver spectral response, sensitivity, frequency response, and dynamic range are key receiver
performance parameters that can affect overall system operation. The choice of optical detector materials
and structures determines the spectral response. Silicon (Si), gallium arsenide (GaAs), and gallium
aluminum arsenide (GaAlAs) are typical detector materials used for receiver operation in the 850-nm
wavelength region. germanium (Ge), indium phosphide (InP), and indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) are
examples of detector materials used for receiver operation in the 1300-nm and 1550-nm wavelength
regions.
