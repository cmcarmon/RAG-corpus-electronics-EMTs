A time zone is a geographical region in which residents observe the same standard time.
A time offset is an amount of time subtracted from or added to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) time to get the current civil time, whether it is standard time or daylight saving time (DST).
In any particular time zone, residents either observe standard time all year round (as in Russia or South Africa), or observe standard time during winter and daylight time during summer (as in most of the United States and Europe).
