Calculating the efﬁciency of a defect removal operation, or a series, is necessarily a long-range operation.
All  defects  encountered  prior  to  release  are  enumerated  and  running  totals  are  kept.  After  the  ﬁrst  year  of
production, the client-reported defects and the pre-release defects are aggregated as a set, and the efﬁciencies
of pre-release operations are then calibrated. Thus for large systems with multi-year development cycles, it may
take up to ﬁve years before defect removal efﬁciency rates are fully known.
