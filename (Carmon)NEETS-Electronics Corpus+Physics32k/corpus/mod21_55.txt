by computers, printers, tape and card punches, and magnetic-tape equipment. Digital multimeters are
typically compact and lightweight; many come with rechargeable batteries, making them ideal for
portable field use. The disadvantages are that they are not rugged and will not tolerate abuse and that
some models do not produce sufficient bias voltage to test a diode or transistor junction. The John Fluke
Model 77 A/N digital multimeter is presently being purchased by the Navy and will eventually phase out
the older and less accurate analog meters.
