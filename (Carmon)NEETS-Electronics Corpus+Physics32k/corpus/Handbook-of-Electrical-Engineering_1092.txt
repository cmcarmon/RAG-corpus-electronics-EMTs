A  data  sequence  is  available  only  with  a  ﬁnite  time  window  from  n  =  0  to  n  =  N  –  1.  The  transform  is
discretized for N values by taking samples at the frequencies 2p/NT, where T is the time interval between sample
points. Hence, we deﬁne the DFT of a sequence of N samples for 0 £ k £ N – 1 by the relation
