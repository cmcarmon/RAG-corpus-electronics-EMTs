which for most JFETs is in the 20- to 400-W range. At the other extreme, when VGS > VP , the drain-to-source
current IDS is reduced to a very small value, generally down into the low nanoampere or even picoampere range.
The  corresponding  value  of  rds  is  not  really  inﬁnite  but  is  very  large,  generally  well  up  into  the  gigaohm
(1000 MW) range. Thus by variation of VG S , the drain-to-source resistance can be varied over a very wide range.
As long as the gate-to-channel junction is reverse-biased, the gate current will be very small, generally down
in the low nanoampere or even picoampere range, so the gate as a control electrode draws very little current.
Since VP is generally in the 2- to 5-V range for most JFETs, the VDS values required to operate the JFET in the
VVR range are generally  < 0.1 V. In Fig. 24.23 the VVR region of the JFET IDS vs. VDS characteristics is shown.
VVR Applications
Applications  of  VVRs  include  automatic  gain  control  (AGC)  circuits,  electronic  attenuators,  electronically
variable ﬁlters, and oscillator amplitude control circuits.
