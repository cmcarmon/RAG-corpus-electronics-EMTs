Spain has different speed limits for every kind of road and vehicle. Until 1973, there were no speed limits on Spanish motorways, a generic limit of 130 km/h was instated then in order to save fuel during the 1973 energy crisis. It was lowered to 100 km/h to prevent accidents, but it was raised again in 1992, this time to 120 km/h. There have been proposals to raise the speed limit to 130 km/h, but have been rejected so far.
As of the 7 March 2011 and until 30 June 2011, the maximum speed limit in Spain was reduced from 120 km/h to 110 km/h, in order to save fuel due to the ongoing Arab Spring.
Standard speed limits are:
Motorways and autovías:
120 km/h for cars and motorbikes
100 km/h for buses and vans
90 km/h for trucks and vehicles with a trailer weighing 750 kg or less
80 km/h for vehicles with a trailer weighing more than 750 kg

Bicycles and mopeds are not allowed to access a motorway – exceptionally bicycles may ride on the shoulders of autovías, but mopeds are banned.
Standard roads meeting at least one of the following criteria:

one-way roads
roads with more than two lanes for at least one direction of traffic
roads with shoulders more than 1.5m wide

100 km/h for cars and motorbikes
90 km/h for buses, vans and vehicles with a trailer weighing 750 kg or less
80 km/h for trucks and vehicles with a trailer weighing more than 750 kg
45 km/h for bicycles and mopeds

Other standard roads:
90 km/h for cars and motorbikes
80 km/h for buses, vans and vehicles with a trailer weighing 750 kg or less
70 km/h for trucks and vehicles with a trailer weighing more than 750 kg
45 km/h for bicycles and mopeds

On standard roads (but not motorways or autovías), cars and motorbikes are allowed to overtake at 20 km/h over the standard limit, if the vehicle being overtaken is travelling below the speed limit, and there is no posted speed limit lower than the standard. This permission decreases the time needed to overtake, and increases safety in the process.
On all non-urban roads and motorways, school buses and vehicles containing contaminant, explosive or flammable materials must decrease their speed limit by 10 km/h.
Built-up areas:
50 km/h for all motor vehicles
45 km/h for bicycles and mopeds

On motorways, a minimum speed of 60 km/h is mandatory for all kinds of vehicles. Minimum speeds in the rest of roads are one half of the generic speed limit for every vehicle. If a posted speed limit sign is below this value, the minimum speed is the posted limit minus 10 km/h.
No legal sanction is established for driving within 10 percent over the speed limit, depending on the specific limit of the area.
