Although magnetic lines of force are imaginary, a simplified version of many magnetic phenomena
can be explained by assuming the magnetic lines to have certain real properties. The lines of force can be
compared to rubber bands which stretch outward when a force is exerted upon them and contract when
the force is removed. The characteristics of magnetic lines of force can be described as follows:
