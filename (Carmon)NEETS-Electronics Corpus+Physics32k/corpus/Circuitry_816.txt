PIC programming 
 
PIC  programming  can  be  carried  out  using 
assembly  language,  C  (see  Table  18.2),  BASIC, 
and Flowcode (see page 324) or a mixture of these 
languages.  Software  and  a  programmer  (see  Figs 
18.6 and 18.7) will be required to do this. The two 
most  commonly  used  methods  of  programming  a 
PIC chip are shown in Fig. 18.8. In Fig. 18.8(a) a 
dedicated  PIC  programmer  is  used  whilst  in  Fig. 
18.8(b)  the  PIC  is  programmed  whilst  resident  in 
the target system. In either case, the programming 
software  and  source  code  is  resident  on  a  PC  and 
downloaded as hex code into the PIC. The  process 
of  generating  the  source  code,  compiling  and/or 
assembling  it  into  hex,  code  (see  Fig.  18.10)  is 
invariably  performed  by  software  known  as  an 
Integrated  Development  Environment  (IDE), as 
shown in Fig. 18.9. Software is also available that 
can  be  used  to  simulate  a  PIC  (see  Figs  18.11  to 
18.13)  and  full  development  systems  are  also 
available (see Figs 18.14 and  18.15).
