Where  drive  current  is  insufficient  to  operate  an 
LED, an auxiliary transistor can be used as shown 
in  Fig.  16.26.  The  LED  will  operate  when  the 
output from a logic circuit card is taken to logic 1 
and the operating current should be approximately 
15  mA  (thereby  providing  a  brighter  display  than 
the arrangements previously  described). The value 
of  LED  series  resistance  will  be  dependent  upon 
the supply voltage and can be determined from the 
equation  shown  on  page  95  or  it  can  be  selected 
from the data shown in Table 16.4.
