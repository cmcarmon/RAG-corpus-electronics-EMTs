1. Commutative property: x1  x2 ¼ x2  x1.
2. Associative property: x1  [x2  x3]¼ [x1  x2] x3.
3. Distributive property: x1  [x2 þ x3]¼ x1  x2 þ x1  x3.
In expressions 1 through 3, if x1 is assumed to represent
system input and x2 and x3 represent system impulse re-
sponses, then these have useful interpretations for an inter-
connected system. The associative property implies that a
cascade connection of two LSI systems is equivalent to a single
system with impulse response equal to the convolution of the
two individual system impulse responses. The distributive
property implies that a parallel connection of two LSI systems
can be represented by a single system with impulse response
equal
to the sum of the two individual system impulse
responses.
