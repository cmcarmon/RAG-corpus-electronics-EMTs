• A bridge circuit can be simpliﬁed to a series/parallel circuit by converting half of it from a
∆ to a Y network. After voltage drops between the original three connection points (A, B,
and C) have been solved for, those voltages can be transferred back to the original bridge
circuit, across those same equivalent points.
