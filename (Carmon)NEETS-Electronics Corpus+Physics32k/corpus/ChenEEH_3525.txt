Linearity
A linear system is one where the response (output) of a system
to the sum of scaled stimuli (inputs) equals the sum of its
scaled responses to each individual stimulus. Consider a dis-
crete-time system T such that the output corresponding to an
input x1[n] is y1[n] ¼ T (x1[n]), and the output corresponding
to an input x2[n] is y2[n] ¼ T (x2[n]). The system is said to be
linear if:
