The microwave tube was developed when the use of the frequency spectrum went beyond 1,000 
megahertz and into the microwave range. The microwave tube uses transit time in the conversion of dc 
power to radio-frequency (rf) power. The interchange of power is accomplished by using the principle of 
electron VELOCITY MODULATION and low-loss resonant cavities in the microwave tube.
