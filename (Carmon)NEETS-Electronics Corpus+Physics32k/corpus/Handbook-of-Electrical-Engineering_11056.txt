The second type of eddy-current stimulator employs energy recovery and is shown in Fig. 113.26. The charged
capacitor (C) is discharged into the stimulating coil (L) by triggering a silicon-controlled rectiﬁer (SCR). By
placing a diode across the SCR as shown, some of the energy stored in the magnetic ﬁeld can be recovered to
recharge the capacitor. In this way, the power supply need only deliver a modest amount of current to restore
the charge on the capacitor.
