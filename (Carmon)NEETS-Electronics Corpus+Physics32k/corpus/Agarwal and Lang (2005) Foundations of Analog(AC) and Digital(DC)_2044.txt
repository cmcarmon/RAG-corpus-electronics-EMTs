the same relation we found in Chapter 12 (Equation 12.109) by examining the
response to a short pulse. Comparison with the corresponding expression for
the parallel RLC circuit indicates that for high Q in a parallel resonant circuit, R
should be large, whereas in the series case, Rs should be small. Confusing, but
correct.
