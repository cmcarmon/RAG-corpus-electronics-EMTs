Wavenumbers k
The wavenumber k is the magnitude of the wave vector 
 and is of more fundamental importance in electro-
magnetic wave theory than both of the more popular concepts of wavelength l  and frequency f. In Fig. 35.1,
we  illustrate  the  electromagnetic  wave  spectrum  according  to  the  free  space  wavenumber  k  =  ko = w/c.  The
corresponding  values  of  frequency  and  wavelength  are  f  =  ck o /2p  and  l  =  2p/ko .  It  is  useful  to  deﬁne  a
fundamental unit Ko such that for free space ko = 1Ko = 2p  m–1. Thus ko = A Ko corresponds to l  = 1/A m and
f = 3 · 108 A Hz. The photon energy in electronvolts is calculated from \w  = \ck where \ = 1.05 · 10–34 Joule-
sec is Planck’s constant divided by 2p and the electron charge is q = 1.6 · 10–19 C. Thus \w = (2p\c/q)ko » 1.26
· 10–6 ko and ko = A Ko corresponds to 1.26 · 10–6 A eV.
