At the instant the switch is closed, the positive terminal of the battery extracts an electron from the
bottom conductor. The negative terminal of the battery forces an electron into the top conductor. At this
same instant an electron is forced into the top plate of the capacitor and another is pulled from the bottom
plate. Thus, in every part of the circuit a clockwise DISPLACEMENT of electrons occurs simultaneously.
