Distributed coupled RC(L) tree structure models become nec-
essary even for the early design stages. Many papers addressed
this problem (Vittal and Marek-Sadowska, 1999; Davis and
Meindl, 2000; Kuhlmann and Sapatnekar, 2001). The distrib-
uted p, 3p, and 4p models have been used in (Kahng et al.,
1999, 2001; Murat et al., 2002), respectively. We describe the p
model in Figure 8.6.
