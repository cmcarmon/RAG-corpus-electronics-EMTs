Homogeneous (Uniform) Plane Wave
One important class of plane waves is the class of homoge-
neous or uniform plane waves. A homogeneous plane wave is
one for which the direction angles are, by deÔ¨Ånition, real. A
homogeneous plane wave enjoys certain special properties that
are not true in general for all plane waves. For such a plane
wave, the wave number vector can be written as:
