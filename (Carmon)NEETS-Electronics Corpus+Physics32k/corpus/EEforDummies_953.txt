Avoiding static like the plague
One type of everyday electricity that can be dangerous to people and elec-
tronic components is static electricity. It’s called static because it’s a form 
of current that remains trapped in some insulating body, even after you 
remove the power source. Static electricity hangs around until it dissipates 
in some way. Most static dissipates slowly over time, but in some cases, it 
gets released all at once. Lightning is one of the most common forms of static 
electricity.
