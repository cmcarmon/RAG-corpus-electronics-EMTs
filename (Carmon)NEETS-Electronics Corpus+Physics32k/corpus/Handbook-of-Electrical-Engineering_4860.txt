The variation of P l with direction may be considered as a property surface. The distance from the center to
any point in the surface is equal to the magnitude of Pl . The function F[q,j] has a maximum for q = 54(cid:176) 40`
and j = 45(cid:176) which is the <111> family of directions, for which Pl takes the following form,
