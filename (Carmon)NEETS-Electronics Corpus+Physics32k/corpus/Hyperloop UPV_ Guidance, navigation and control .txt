The guidance and navigation system has been designed with multiple and redundant sensors with different technologies in order to achieve a fault-tolerant system. An optical mark system has been chosen to locate the pod. The distances between marks has been increased up to 200 m and an absolute positioning system has been added through the analysis of camera images. The controlled variables are pod-to-tube gap distance and pod attitude.
