This result is important because it shows that the voltages across two parallel-
connected elements must be the same. In fact, with multiple applications of
KVL, this observation is extendible to a longer string of parallel-connected
elements. Such an extension would show that a common voltage appears across
all parallel-connected elements in the string.
