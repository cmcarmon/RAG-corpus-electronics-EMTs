This shows that the voltage across the inductor is directly proportional to inductance and the change
in current, but inversely proportional to a change in time. Since current and time start from zero, the
change in time ( D T) and the change in current (D I) are equal to the final time (T) and final current (I). For
this case the equation becomes:
