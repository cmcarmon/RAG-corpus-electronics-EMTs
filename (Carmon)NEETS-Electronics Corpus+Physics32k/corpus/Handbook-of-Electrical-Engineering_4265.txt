Smoothing performance is constrained by the degree of a priori knowledge of the target’s kinematic motion
characteristics. For example, Kalman ﬁltering can achieve signiﬁcantly better error reduction against ballistic
or orbital targets than against maneuvering aircraft. In the former case the equations of motion are explicitly
known,  while  the  latter  case  imposes  motion  model  error  because  of  the  presence  of  unpredictable  pilot  or
guidance  system  commands.  Similar  considerations  apply  to  the  ﬁdelity  of  the  track  ﬁlter’s  model  of  radar
measurement error. Failure to consider the impact of correlated measurement errors may result in underesti-
mating track error when designing the system.
