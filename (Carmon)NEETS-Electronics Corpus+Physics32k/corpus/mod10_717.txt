RADIATION PATTERN.â€”The radiation pattern for a pair of parallel half-wave elements fed 180 
degrees out of phase is shown in figure 4-29, view A. The elements shown are spaced 1/2 wavelength 
apart. In practice, smaller spacings are used. Radiation from elements L and M traveling toward point P 
begins 180 degrees out of phase. Moving the same distance over approximately parallel paths, the 
respective wavefronts from these elements remain 180 degrees out of phase. In other words, maximum 
cancellation takes place in the direction of P. The same condition is true for the opposite direction (toward 
P1). The P to P1 axis is the line of least radiation for the end-fire array.
