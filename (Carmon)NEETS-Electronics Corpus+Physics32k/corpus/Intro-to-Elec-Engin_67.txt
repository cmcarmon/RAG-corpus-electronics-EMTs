voltage or current does depend on the value of some other voltage or current. As an example, a
voltage ampliﬁer producing an output voltage vout = Avin, where vin is the input voltage and A is
the constant-voltage ampliﬁcation factor, is shown in Figure 1.1.7, along with its controlled-source
model using the diamond-shaped symbol. Current sources controlled by a current or voltage will
also be considered eventually.
