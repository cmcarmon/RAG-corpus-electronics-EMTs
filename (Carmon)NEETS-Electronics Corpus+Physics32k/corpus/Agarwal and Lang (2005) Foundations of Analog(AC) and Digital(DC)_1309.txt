Since they are duals, the operation of the circuit in Figure 9.38 is much the same as
that of the circuit in Figure 9.36. Once the voltage source steps its value to Vâ—¦ the
current through the inductor begins to increase linearly. More formally, the substitution
of Equation 9.77 into Equation 9.65 yields
