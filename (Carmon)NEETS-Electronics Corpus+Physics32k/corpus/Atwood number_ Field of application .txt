Atwood number is an important parameter in the study of Rayleigh–Taylor instability and Richtmyer–Meshkov instability. In Rayleigh–Taylor instability, the penetration distance of heavy fluid bubbles into the light fluid is a function of acceleration time scale,




A

g

t

2




{\displaystyle \mathrm {A} gt^{2}}
where g is the gravitational acceleration and t is the time.
