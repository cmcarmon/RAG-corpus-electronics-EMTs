You may be wondering why you need to learn about video and rf amplifiers. You need to understand
these circuits because, as a technician, you will probably be involved in working on equipment in which
these circuits are used. Many of the circuits shown in this and the next chapter are incomplete and would
not be used in actual equipment. For example, the complete biasing network may not be shown. This is
done so you can concentrate on the concepts being presented without being overwhelmed by an
abundance of circuit elements. With this idea in mind, the information that is presented in this chapter is
real, practical information about video and rf amplifiers. It is the sort of information that you will use in
working with these circuits. Engineering information (such as design specifications) will not be presented
because it is not needed to understand the concepts that a technician needs to perform the job of circuit
analysis and repair. Before you are given the specific information on video and rf amplifiers, you may be
wondering how these circuits are used.
