Memory
For a digital computer which stores both programs and data, memory can be divided into three
types: random-access memory, mass storage, and archival storage. Random-access memory
includes read-and-write memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), programmable read-only
memory (PROM), and erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM), in which any
memory location can be accessed in about the same time. The time required to access data
in a mass-storage device is relative to its location in the device. Mass storage, such as magnetic-
disk memory, has a relatively large storage capacity and is lower in cost per bit than random-
access memory. Archival storage, such as magnetic tape, is long-term storage with a very large
capacity, but with a very slow access time, and may need user intervention for access by the
system.
