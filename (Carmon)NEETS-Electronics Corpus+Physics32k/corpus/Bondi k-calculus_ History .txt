The k-calculus method had previously been used by E. A. Milne in 1935. Milne used the letter



s


{\displaystyle s}
to denote a constant Doppler factor, but also considered a more general case involving non-inertial motion (and therefore a varying Doppler factor). Bondi used the letter



k


{\displaystyle k}
instead of



s


{\displaystyle s}
and simplified the presentation (for constant



k


{\displaystyle k}
only), and introduced the name "k-calculus".
