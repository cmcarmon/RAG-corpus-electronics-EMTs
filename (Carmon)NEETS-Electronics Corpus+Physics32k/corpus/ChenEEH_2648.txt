Any of these two equations can be used to solve for JJ s. How-
ever, for a given So, L can be singular at certain frequencies
when the exterior medium is lossless. Consequently, equation
8.44 may give an erroneous solution at these frequencies. This
is known as the problem of interior resonance, and the
singular frequencies correspond to the resonant frequencies
of a cavity formed by ﬁlling the interior of So with the exterior
medium. A similar problem occurs in equation 8.45 as well. To
eliminate this problem, we can combine equations 8.44 and
8.45 to ﬁnd:
