There is no known INSULATOR for magnetic flux. If a nonmagnetic material is placed in a
magnetic field, there is no appreciable change in fluxâ€”that is, the flux penetrates the nonmagnetic
material. For example, a glass plate placed between the poles of a horseshoe magnet will have no
appreciable effect on the field although glass itself is a good insulator in an electric circuit. If a magnetic
material (for example, soft iron) is placed in a magnetic field, the flux may be redirected to take
advantage of the greater permeability of the magnetic material, as shown in figure 1-17. Permeability, as
discussed earlier, is the quality of a substance which determines the ease with which it can be magnetized.
