Consequently, H(cid:98)c = H (c ⊕ e) = He. Because the result of the product is a length- (N − K) vector of binary
1. compute (conceptually at least) H(cid:98)c;
4. add the error vector thus obtained to the received vector(cid:98)c to correct the error (because (c ⊕ e ⊕ e) = c).
5. Select the data bits from the corrected word to produce the received bit sequence(cid:98)b (n).
