Radar Proximity Fuzes
Projectiles or missiles designed to be aimed at ships or surface land targets often need a height-of-burst (HOB)
sensor (or target detection device) to ﬁre or fuze the warhead at a height of a few meters. There are two primary
generic methods of sensing or measuring height to generate the warhead ﬁre signal. The most obvious, and
potentially the most accurate, is to measure target round trip propagation delay employing conventional radar
ranging techniques. The second method employs a simple CW Doppler radar or variation thereof, with loop
gain  calibrated  in  a  manner  that  permits  sensing  the  desired  burst  height  by  measurement  of  target  return
signal amplitude and/or rate of change. Often the mission requirements do not justify the complexity and cost
of the radar ranging approach. Viable candidates are thus narrowed down to variations on the CW doppler fuze.
In its simplest form, the CW Doppler fuze consists of a fractional watt RF oscillator, homodyne detector, Doppler
ampliﬁer, Doppler envelope detector, and threshold circuit. When the Doppler envelope amplitude derived from
the returned signal reaches the preset threshold, a ﬁre signal is generated. The height at which the ﬁre signal occurs
depends on the radar loop gain, threshold level, and target reﬂectivity. Fuze gain is designed to produce the desired
height of burst under nominal trajectory angle and target reﬂectivity conditions, which may have large ﬂuctuations
due  to  glint  effects,  and  deviations  from  the  desired  height  due  to  antenna  gain  variations  with  angle,  target
reﬂectivity, and fuze gain tolerances are accepted. A loop gain change of 6 dB (2 to 1 in voltage), whether due to
a change in target reﬂection coefﬁcient, antenna gain, or whatever, will result in a 2 to 1 HOB change.
