RFV can best be explained by example. Assume a perfectly uniform tire mounted on a perfectly round wheel loaded with a constant force against a perfectly round test wheel. As the wheel turns, it turns the tire, and the tire carcass undergoes repeated deformation and recovery as it enters and exits the contact area. If we measure the radial force between the tire and the wheel we will see zero change as the tire turns. If we now test a typical production tire we will see the radial force vary as the tire turns. This variation will be induced by two primary mechanisms, variation in the thickness of the tire, and variation in the elastomeric properties of the tire.
Consider a good tire with RFV of 6 pounds (27 N). This tire will induce a 6-pound force upward into the vehicle every rotation. The frequency of the force will increase in direct proportion to rotating speed. Tire makers test tires at the point of manufacture to verify that the RFV is within allowable quality limits. Tires that exceed these limits may be scrapped or sold to markets that do not require stringent quality.
