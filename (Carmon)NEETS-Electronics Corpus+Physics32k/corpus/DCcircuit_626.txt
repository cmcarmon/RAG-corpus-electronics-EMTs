â€¢ When a component fails open, its resistance always increases. The current through that
component will decrease to zero, because it is an incomplete electrical path (no continu-
ity). This may result in an increase of voltage across it. The same exception stated above
applies here as well: in a simple parallel circuit with an ideal voltage source, the voltage
across an open-failed component will remain unchanged.
