Equivalent  circuit  models  are  basically  used  to  replace  the  semiconductor  device  in  an  electronic  circuit.
These  models  are  developed  from  an  understanding  of  the  deviceâ€™s  current  and  voltage  behavior  for  novel
devices where internal device operation is not well understood. For such situations, the designer has another
tool available, the semiconductor device simulator.
