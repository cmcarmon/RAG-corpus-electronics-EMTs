Many  opportunities  exist  for  ﬂexible  assembly  systems.  Many  of  the  issues  for  such  systems  have  been
addressed by Soni [1991]. The reader is also referred to the Design for Robotic Assembly Handbook [Boothroyd
and Dewhurst, 1985] for quantitative methods to evaluate a product’s ease of assembly by robots. Carter [1990]
presents a method for determining robot assembly task time as derived from tests and industrial experience.
Carter also addresses the relationship between product design and robotic assembly cycle time. Some of the
current  trends  in  automated  assembly  include  coordinating  multiple  robots  to  increase  the  ﬂexibility  and
reliability of an assembly cell [Coupes et al., 1989; Zheng and Sias, 1986], interaction with CAD databases to
automatically generate assembly plans [Wolter, 1989; Nnaji, 1989] and the application of sensors to automatic
assembly systems [Cook, 1991]. Meijer and Jonker [1991] consider an architecture for an intelligent assembly
cell  and  its  subsequent  implementation.  An  article  by  Jarneteg  [1990]  considers  the  strategies  necessary  for
developing adaptive assembly systems.
