Although many of these Java APIs provide services useful in
middleware, a complete package is available in Java: the Jini
network technology. Jini is a software architecture for integrat-
ing hardware over a network. The lower layers of the architec-
ture handle network protocol decisions, so these decisions are
transparent to the user who interfaces at the higher layers. The
user also has the option of performing remote method calls
using the Java RMI technology, CORBA services, or XML.
Thus, Jini can be used as a complementary technology to
CORBA. There is a strong continuing effort in the Java com-
munity to build new APIs that are increasingly aimed at
making Java the basis for integrating multiple components
across a network with real-time speciﬁcations. Because this
ﬁeld changes rapidly, the reader is encouraged to visit the
Sun Microsystems Java Web site for updates.
