The major advantage of the cycle is that the expansion ratio is greater than the compression ratio. By intercooling after the external supercharging, an opportunity exists to reduce NOx emissions for diesel, or knock for spark ignition engine. However, multiple tradeoffs on boosting system efficiency and friction (due to the larger displacement) need to be balanced for every application.
