As an example of the use of the transmission line model, consider a pure longitudinal wave propagating in
an isotropic solid and incident normally on the interface with a second isotropic solid. There would be one
reﬂected wave and one transmitted wave, both longitudinally polarized. The relative amplitudes of the stresses
in  these  waves  would  be  given,  with  direct  use  transmission  line  concepts,  by  the  voltage  reﬂection  and
transmission coefﬁcients
