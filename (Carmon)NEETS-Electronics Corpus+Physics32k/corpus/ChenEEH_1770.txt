. Session control: As said previously, a multimedia session
involves multiple media streams. The information con-
tained in these data streams is often interrelated, and
the multimedia communication network must guarantee
to maintain such relationships as the streams are trans-
mitted and presented to the user. This is called multi-
media synchronization and can be achieved by putting
time stamps in every media packet. Moreover, many
Internet multimedia users may want to control the play-
back of continuous media by pausing, playing back, re-
positioning the playback to a future or past point in time,
visual fast-forwarding, or visual rewinding of the play-
back (Kurose and Ross, 2001). This functionality is simi-
lar to what we have in a VCR while watching a video or
is similar to what we have in a CD player when listening
to a CD.
