Linear free-energy relationships (LFERs) exist when the relative influence of changing substituents on one reactant is similar to the effect on another reactant, and include linear Hammett plots, Swain–Scott plots, and Brønsted plots. LFERs are not always found to hold, and to see when one can expect them to, we examine the relationship between the free-energy differences for the two reactions under comparison. The extent to which the free energy of the new reaction is changed, via a change in substituent, is proportional to the extent to which the reference reaction was changed by the same substitution. A ratio of the free-energy differences is the reaction quotient or constant Q.

(ΔG'0 – ΔG'x) = Q(ΔG0 – ΔGx)

The above equation may be rewritten as the difference (δ) in free-energy changes (ΔG):

δΔG = QδΔG

Substituting the Gibbs free-energy equation (ΔG = ΔH – TΔS) into the equation above yields a form that makes clear the requirements for LFERs to hold.

(ΔH' – TΔS') = Q(ΔH – TΔS)

One should expect LFERs to hold if one of three conditions are met:
(1) δΔH 's are coincidentally the same for both the new reaction under study and the reference reaction, and the δΔS 's are linearly proportional for the two reactions being compared.
(2) δΔS 's are coincidentally the same for both the new reaction under study and the reference reaction, and the δΔH 's are linearly proportional for the two reactions being compared.
(3) δΔH 's and δΔS 's are linearly related to each other for both the reference reaction and the new reaction.
The third condition describes the enthalpy–entropy effect and is the condition most commonly met.
