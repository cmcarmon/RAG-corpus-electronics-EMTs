The branch wire is laid behind the main wire. About three-fourths of the bare portion of the branch 
wire extends above the main wire. The branch wire is brought under the main wire, around itself, and then 
over the main wire to form a knot. The branch wire is then wrapped around the main conductor in short, 
tight turns; and the end is trimmed off.
