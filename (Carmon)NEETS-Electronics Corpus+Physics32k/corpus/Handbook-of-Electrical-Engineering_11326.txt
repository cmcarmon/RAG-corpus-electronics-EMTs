Future
In the future, ICDs will continue to evolve into increasingly sophisticated cardiac rhythm management devices.
The ICD is no longer simply a safeguard against ventricular ﬁbrillation; it is, moreover, being called to better
manage bradycardias and tachycardias, and may eventually be used to predict and prevent arrhythmias from
ever occurring. Management of atrial arrhythmias is also an important emerging frontier. To facilitate these
and other demands, a number of advancements are currently being explored [Morris et al., 1999]. New lead
systems  will  be  smaller,  more  reliable,  and  better  designed  to  manage  atrial  arrhythmias. Additional  sensors
may be incorporated, such as pressure transducers to measure hemodynamic stability. More complex rhythm
discrimination algorithms will be developed to ensure that appropriate therapy is given at the appropriate time.
Advances  in  electronics,  battery,  and  capacitor  technology  will  allow  the  ICD  to  continue  to  shrink  in  size.
Diagnostic capabilities will be expanded due to increases in memory, and efforts will be made to dramatically
decrease the complexity of programming the ICD. Finally, basic research will produce important advances in
arrhythmia management, the signiﬁcance of which cannot yet be imagined.
