The in-phase or quadrature components of V and I do not depend on the speciﬁc values of the angles of
each, but on their phase difference. One can imagine the two phasors in the preceding diagram to be rigidly
held together and rotated around the origin by any angle. As long as the angle q is held ﬁxed, all of the discussion
of  this  section  will  still  apply.  It  is  common  to  take  the  current  phasor  as  the  reference  for  angle;  that  is,  to
choose b = 0 so that phasor I lies along the real axis. Then q = a.
Power Factor
For any given circuit it is useful to know what part of the total complex power is real (average) power and what
part  is  reactive  power.  This  is  usually  expressed  in  terms  of  the  power factor  Fp,  deﬁned  as  the  ratio  of  real
power to apparent power:
