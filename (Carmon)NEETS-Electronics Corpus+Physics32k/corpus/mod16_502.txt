switch selects the conventional TVM mode of operation and the various full-scale null detector sensitivity
ranges when the instrument is operated in the differential mode of operation. The RANGE switch allows
selection of the desired input voltage range, positions the readout dial decimal point, and selects the
various ranges of the NULL SENSE switch. The readout dials provide a digital readout of the measured
voltage when the instrument is in the differential mode.
