The effectiveness of an entire transmitting/ receiving system depends largely on impedance matching 
between the elements of the system. Impedance matching is particularly critical at the antenna connection. 
If a good impedance match is maintained between the system and the antenna throughout the operating 
frequency band, power transfer to and from the antenna is always maximum. The transmission line or 
waveguide used to transport energy to and from the antenna should have a characteristic impedance equal 
to that of the antenna. A proper impedance match allows all available power to be absorbed and radiated 
by the antenna without reflections back down the line.
