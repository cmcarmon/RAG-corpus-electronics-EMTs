Neutrons are much less inï¬‚uential on the chemical character and identity of an atom than
protons, although they are just as hard to add to or remove from the nucleus, being so tightly
bound. If neutrons are added or gained, the atom will still retain the same chemical iden-
tity, but its mass will change slightly and it may acquire strange nuclear properties such as
radioactivity.
