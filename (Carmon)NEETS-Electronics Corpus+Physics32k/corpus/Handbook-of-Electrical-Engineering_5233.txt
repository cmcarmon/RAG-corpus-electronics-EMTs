The  ﬁgure  shows  that  only  one  bearing  is  between  each  of  the
machines. The shafts are connected to form a tandem compound steam
turbine unit. High-pressure steam enters the high-pressure turbine to ﬂow through and drive the turbine. The
exhaust is reheated in the boiler and returned to the lower-pressure units. Both the rotor and the stationary
part of the turbine have blades. The length of the blades increases from the steam entrance to the exhaust.
