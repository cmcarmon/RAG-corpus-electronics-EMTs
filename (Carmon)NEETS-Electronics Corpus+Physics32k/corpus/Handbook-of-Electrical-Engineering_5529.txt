The  magnitude  of  the  harmonics  can  be  reduced  using  two  methods.  In  the  Ô¨Årst,  the  reactor  is  split  into
smaller steps, while only one step is phase-angle controlled. The other reactor steps are either on or off. This
decreases the magnitude of all harmonics. The second method involves the 12-pulse arrangement, where two
identical  connected  thyristor-controlled  reactors  are  used,  one  operated  from  a  wye-connected  secondary
winding, the other from a delta-connected winding of a step-up transformer. TCR units are characterized by
continuous control, and there is a maximum of one half-cycle delay for executing a command from the regulator.
In many applications, the arrangement of an SVC consists of a few large steps of thyristor-switched capacitor
and  one  or  two  thyristor-controlled  reactors,  as  shown  in  Fig. 61.26(c).  The  following  are  some  practical
schemes.
