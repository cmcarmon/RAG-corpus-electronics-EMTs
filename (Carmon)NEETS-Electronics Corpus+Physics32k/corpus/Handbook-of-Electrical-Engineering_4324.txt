Equations (42.13a) and (42.13b) are transcendental, have multiple solutions, and are better solved graphically.
Let  (d/l)0  denote  the  smallest  value  of  d/l,  the  Ô¨Ålm  thickness  normalized  with  respect  to  the  wavelength,
satisfying Eqs. (42.13a) and (42.13b). Other solutions for both even and odd modes are given by
