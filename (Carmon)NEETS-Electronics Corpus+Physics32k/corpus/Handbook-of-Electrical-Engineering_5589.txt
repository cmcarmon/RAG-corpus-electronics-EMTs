Coordination Principles
Consider  the  radial  transmission  system  shown  in  Fig. 61.42.  The  transformer  supplies  power  to  the  feeder,
which has four loads at buses A, B, C, and D. For a fault at F1, the relay Rcd must operate to open the circuit
breaker Bcd. The relay Rbc is responsible for a zone of protection, which includes the entire zone of  Rcd. This
constitutes a remote backup for the protection at bus C. The backup relay (Rbc) must be slower than the primary
relay (Rcd), its associated circuit breaker, with a safety margin. This delay in operating of the backup relay is
known as the coordination delay and is usually about 0.3 s. In a similar fashion, Rab backs up Rbc. The magnitude
of the fault current varies as shown in Fig. 61.42(b), as the location of the fault is moved along the length of
the feeder. We may plot the inverse time characteristic of the relay with the fault location as the abscissa, recalling
that a smaller current magnitude gives rise to a longer operating time for the relay. The coordinating time delay
between the primary and backup relays is also shown. It can be seen that, as we move from the far end of the
feeder toward the source, the fault clearing time becomes progressively longer. The coordination is achieved
by selecting relays with a time dial setting that will provide the proper separation in operating times.
