Note  that  KCL also  applies  to  a  closed  boundary.  This  may  be
regarded  as  a  generalized  case,  because  a  node  may  be  regarded  as  a
closed  surface  shrunk  to  a  point.  In  two  dimensions,  a  closed  bound-
ary is the same as a closed path. As typically illustrated in the circuit
of Fig. 2.17, the total current entering the closed surface is equal to the
total current leaving the surface.
