The only ”given” value different from the normal state of the circuit is R2, which we said
was failed shorted (abnormally low resistance). All other initial values are the same as they
were before, as represented by the ”same” entries. All we have to do now is work through the
familiar Ohm’s Law and series-parallel principles to determine what will happen to all the
other circuit values.
