Another good way to isolate the trouble in an operating synchro system is to use known operating 
voltages as references for faulty operation. Since the proper operation of a system is indicated by specific 
rotor and stator voltages, an ac voltmeter can be used to locate the trouble. When an ac voltmeter is 
connected between any two stator leads, the voltage should vary from 0 to 90 volts (0 to 11.8 volts for 26-
volt systems) as the transmitter rotates. The zero and maximum voltage values should occur at the 
following headings:
