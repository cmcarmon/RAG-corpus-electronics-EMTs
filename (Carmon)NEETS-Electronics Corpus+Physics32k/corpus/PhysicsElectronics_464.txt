where the partial derivatives are evaluated at a particular IB and VCE – the operating
point. hf e ≡ ∂IC/∂IB|IB,VCE is the forward current transfer ratio and describes the vertical
spacing ∆IC/∆IB between the curves. The output admittance (inverse resistance) is hoe ≡
∂IC/∂VCE|IB,VCE and describes the slope ∆IC/∆VCE of one of the curves as it passes through
