Recently, Sitters et al. have shown that acoustics can be used to manipulate single (bio) molecules such as DNA and proteins. This method, which the inventors name Acoustic Force Spectroscopy, allows one to measure the force response of single molecules. This is achieved by attaching small micro spheres to the molecules at one side and attaching them to a surface at the other. By pushing the micro spheres away from the surface with a standing acoustic wave the molecules are effectively stretched out.
