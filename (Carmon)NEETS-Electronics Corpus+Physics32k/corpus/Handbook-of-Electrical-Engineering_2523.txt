Small-Signal Operation
In the biasing circuit of Fig. 24.27, the collector resistor RC had no discernible function, because it is simply
the load resistor across which the signal output voltage is developed. However, it was included because it also
drops a voltage due to the bias current ï¬‚owing through it. This means that its value must not be so large that
it robs the transistor of adequate operating voltage; that is, it must not be responsible for moving the operating
point too far to the left in Fig. 24.28.
