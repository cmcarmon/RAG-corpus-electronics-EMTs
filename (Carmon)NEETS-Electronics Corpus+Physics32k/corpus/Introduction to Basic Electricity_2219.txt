The rotating loop is called an armature, and the 
source of the electromagnetic field is called the field. 
The armature can have any number of loops. The 
term armature refers to the part that rotates in the 
magnetic field, regardless of whether it consists of one 
loop or multiple loops. The frequency of the alter-
nating current or voltage is the number of complete 
cycles completed per second. The speed of rotation 
determines the frequency. An ac	generator is often 
called an alternator because it produces alternating 
current.
