2. Space–time mapping: It is a process of allocating and
scheduling a number of DG nodes to a (usually
smaller) number of PEs with respect to their depend-
encies. The allocation and scheduling can be either a
linear or a nonlinear function of node indices. The
result of space–time mapping is an SFG with desired
objective cost function subject to design criteria.
