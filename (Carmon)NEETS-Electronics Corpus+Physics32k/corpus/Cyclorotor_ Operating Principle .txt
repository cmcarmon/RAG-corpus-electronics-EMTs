Cyclorotors produce thrust by combined action of a rotation of a fixed point of the blades around a center and the oscillation of the blades that changes their angle-of-attack over time. The joint action of the advancement produced by the orbital motion and pitch angle variation generates a higher thrust at low speed than any other propeller. In hover, the blades are actuated to a positive pitch (outward from the center of the rotor) on the upper half of their revolution and a negative pitch (inward towards the axis of rotation) over the lower half inducing a net upward aerodynamic force and opposite fluid downwash. By varying the phase of this pitch motion the force can be shifted to any perpendicular angle or even downward. Before blade stall, increasing the amplitude of the pitching kinematics will magnify thrust.
