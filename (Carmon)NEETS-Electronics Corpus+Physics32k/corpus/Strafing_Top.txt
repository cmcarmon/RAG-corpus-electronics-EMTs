Strafing is the military practice of attacking ground targets from low-flying aircraft using aircraft-mounted automatic weapons Less commonly, the term can be used—by extension—to describe high-speed firing runs by any land or naval craft (e.g. fast boats) using smaller-caliber weapons and targeting stationary or slow-moving targets.
