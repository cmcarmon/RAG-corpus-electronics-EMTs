Figure 80.15  shows  another  way  of  thinking  about  the  varying  demands  of  I/O  intensive  applications.  It
shows the percentage of time different applications spend in the three components of I/O service time. Trans-
action processing systems spend the majority of their service time in seek and rotational latency; thus techno-
logical  advances  which  reduce  the  transfer  time  will  not  affect  their  performance  very  much.  On  the  other
hand, scientiÔ¨Åc applications spend a more equal amount of time in seek and data transfer, and their performance
is sensitive to any improvement in disk technology.
