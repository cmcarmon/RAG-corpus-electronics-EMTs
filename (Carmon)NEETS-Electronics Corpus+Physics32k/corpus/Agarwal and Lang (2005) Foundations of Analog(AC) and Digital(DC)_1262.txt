Suppose the toroidal induc-
tor in Figure 9.13 has a cross-sectional area of 1 cm2, has a length around its toroid
of 10 cm, has a coil with 100 turns, and is filled with free space having permeability
µ◦ = 4π × 10
−7 H/m. What is its inductance? How much flux does its coil link, and
what energy does it store if its terminal current is 0.1 A?
The inductance is determined from Equation 9.23 with µ = 4π × 10
−7 H/m, A =
−4 m2, l = 0.1 m and N = 100. It is 13 µH. The flux linkage is determined from
10
Equation 9.24 with i = 0.1 A. It is 1.3 µWb. Finally, the stored energy is determined
from Equation 9.36. It is 0.063 µJ.
