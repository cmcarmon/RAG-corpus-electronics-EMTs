Polynomials in the indeterminate l with coefﬁcients from a
ﬁeld F, usually represented by F[l], form a commutative ring.
The set of polynomials of degree less than some integer m > 0
with real coefﬁcients along with the standard addition and
multiplication of polynomials form a vector space. Such poly-
nomials can be described by:
