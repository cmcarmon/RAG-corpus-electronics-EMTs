CMOS Circuits Using Megacell Elements
The  examples  above  have  focused  on  low-level  logic  functions.  However,  as  the  complexity  of VLSI  ICs  has
increased, it has become increasingly important to include standard, high-level functions (e.g., microprocessors,
DSPs, PCI interfaces, MPEG coders, RAM arrays, etc.) within an ASIC. For example, an earlier generation of
microprocessor may offer the necessary performance and would occupy only a small portion of the area of a
present-generation ASIC. Including such a standard microprocessor has the advantages of allowing the ASIC
design to be completed more quickly as well as providing users with the microprocessor standard instruction
set and software development tools. Such large cells are called megacells. As VLSI technologies advance and as
standards increasingly impact design decisions, the use of standard megacells will become increasingly common.
