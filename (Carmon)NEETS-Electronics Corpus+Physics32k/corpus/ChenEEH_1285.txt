Optical Memory
The popularity of the optical disk memory as mass storage
media has rapidly grown over the past few years. Optical
mediums have much higher recording density than their con-
ventional magnetic counterparts. In 1980, Phillips in partner-
ship with Sony developed the compact disc (CD) that quickly
replaced the long-playing record. CDs can be prepared by
using high-power infrared laser to burn holes (pits) in a master
disk. Once a master disk is made, the successive copies can be
made very inexpensively (about 2000 copies for $1.00). To read
the disk low-power infrared light is shined through the disk.
Since the surface of the CD consists of pits and smooth
surfaces (lands), the variations of reﬂected light are used to
translate data into a digital signal. Unlike the hard drive in
which the disk is rotated at a constant angular velocity (e.g.,
5400 rpm), the CD drive needs to achieve constant linear
velocity of 120 cm/sec. This means that the angular velocity
when reading on the outside of the disk is 330 rpm, and the
velocity when reading the inside is 530 rpm. In 1984, the
standard for using CDs to store computer data was precisely
deﬁned, and the media was referred to as compact disc read-
only memory (CD-ROM). The standard states that CD-ROM
is to have physical appearance of CDs. Moreover, it must be
optically and mechanically compatible with CDs, which means
the manufacturing techniques must be compatible. Since then,
there have been many advances in CD-ROM technology, such
as creation of the CD-recordable (CD-R), the CD-rewritable
(CD-RW), the digital versatile disc (DVD), and the DVD-
RAM.
