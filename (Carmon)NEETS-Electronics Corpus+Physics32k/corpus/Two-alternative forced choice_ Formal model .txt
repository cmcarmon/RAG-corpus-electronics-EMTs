The accumulation of evidence in the DDM is governed according to the following formula:

=

{\displaystyle dx=Adt+cdW\ ,\ x(0)=0}

At time zero, the evidence accumulated, x, is set equal to zero. At each time step, some evidence, A, is accumulated for one of the two possibilities in the 2AFC. A is positive if the correct response is represented by the upper threshold, and negative if the lower. In addition, a noise term, cdW, is added to represent noise in input. On average, the noise will integrate to zero. The extended DDM allows for selection of

and the starting value of

{\displaystyle x(0)}
from separate distributions â€“ this provides a better fit to experimental data for both accuracy and reaction times.
