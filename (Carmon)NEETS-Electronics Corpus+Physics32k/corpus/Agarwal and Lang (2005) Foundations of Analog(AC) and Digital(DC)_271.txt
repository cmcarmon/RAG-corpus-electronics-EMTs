Note that in summing voltages along a loop we have adopted the con-
vention proposed earlier: A positive branch voltage is added to the sum if the
path enters the positive end of a branch. Otherwise a negative branch voltage is
added to the sum. Therefore, to arrive at Equation 2.9, we have traversed the
loop in the clockwise direction. Next, by negating Equation 2.9, KVL becomes
