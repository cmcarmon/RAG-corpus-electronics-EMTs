The following parameters are often used to describe variograms:
nugget



n


{\displaystyle n}
: The height of the jump of the semivariogram at the discontinuity at the origin.
sill



s


{\displaystyle s}
: Limit of the variogram tending to infinity lag distances.
range



r


{\displaystyle r}
: The distance in which the difference of the variogram from the sill becomes negligible. In models with a fixed sill, it is the distance at which this is first reached; for models with an asymptotic sill, it is conventionally taken to be the distance when the semivariance first reaches 95% of the sill.
