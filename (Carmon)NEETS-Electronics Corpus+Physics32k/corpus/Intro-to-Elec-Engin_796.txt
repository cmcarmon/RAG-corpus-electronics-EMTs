The switching action in the CMOS circuit is rather sharp, as compared with that of Figure
9.3.1(c). A general voltage-transfer characteristic shown in Figure 9.3.3 illustrates this feature. A
very small change in vin is sufﬁcient to produce a relatively large change in vout. The voltages VOH
and VOL, indicated in Figure 9.3.3, are, respectively, the nominal high and low output voltages of
the circuit. VIL and VIH are the input voltages at which |dVout/dVin| = 1. These are seen to be the
boundaries of the low and high ranges. The region between VIL and VIH is known as the transition
region, and the transition width is given by VI H − VI L. The lower and upper noise margins are
given by VI L − VOL ≡ NML and VOH − VI H ≡ NMH , respectively. The noise margins indicate
the largest random noise voltages that can be added to vin (when it is low) or subtracted from vin
(when it is high), without yielding an input in the forbidden transition region. A typical voltage-
transfer characteristic and drain current ID1 versus input voltage vin for the CMOS inverter are
∼= 0. The maximum value of ID1 that occurs
shown in Figure 9.3.4. Note that when vin is inside either the low or the high states (and not in
the transition region), the drain current ID1
during transition is indeed very small.
