The frequency-deviation measurement of a frequency-modulated signal is normally performed with 
either a spectrum analyzer or with a modulation analyzer. The modulation analyzer method is more 
commonly used because of its accuracy. Typical accuracies for a modulation analyzer are within Â±1%. 
Figure 5-7 shows a typical modulation analyzer.
