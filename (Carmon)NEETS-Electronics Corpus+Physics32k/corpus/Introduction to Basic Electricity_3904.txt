The main disadvantage of multistage amplifiers  
is their high thermal instability. In circuits  requiring 
three or four stages of DC amplification, the  final 
 output stage may not amplify the original DC or AC 
signal, but one that has been greatly distorted. The 
same problem exists with the Darlington arrangement.
In applications where both high gain and tempera-
ture stability are required, another type of amplifier is 
necessary. This type is called a differential ampli-
fier (Figure 38-5). It is unique in that it has two sepa-
rate inputs and can provide either one or two outputs. 
If a signal is applied to the input of transistor Q1, an 
amplified signal is produced between output A and 
ground as in an ordinary amplifier. However, a small 
signal is also developed across resistor R4 and is applied 
to the emitter of transistor Q2. Transistor Q2 functions 
as a common-base amplifier and amplifies the signal 
on its base. An amplified output signal is produced be-
tween output B and ground. The output produced at B
