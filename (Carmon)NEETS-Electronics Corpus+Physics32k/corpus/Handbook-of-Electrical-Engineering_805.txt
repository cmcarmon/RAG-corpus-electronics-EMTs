Bode diagram: A frequency response plot of 20 log gain and phase angle on a log-frequency base.
Breakpoint: A point of abrupt change in slope in the straight line approximation of a Bode magnitude curve.
Damping ratio: The ratio between a systemâ€™s damping factor (measure of rate of decay of response) and the
