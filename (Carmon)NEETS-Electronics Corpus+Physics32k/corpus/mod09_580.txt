View (A) of figure 4-22 is the circuit of a negative clamper with negative bias. Again, with no input 
signal the capacitor charges to the battery voltage and the output is negative because the positive side of 
the battery is ground. The bottom of view (B) shows the output of the circuit. Study the figure carefully, 
and note the following important points. The peak-to-peak amplitude and shape of the output wave, for all 
practical purposes, are the same as that of the input wave. The output wave is clamped to −10 volts which 
is the value of the battery. Since this is a negative clamper, the upper extremity of the waveform touches 
the −10 volt reference line (and the rest of it lies below this voltage level).
