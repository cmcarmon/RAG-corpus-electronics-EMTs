Sidebands created by fm differ from the AM system. You should recall that the AM system consists
of a single set of side frequencies for each radio-frequency signal modulated. An fm signal inherently
occupies a wider bandwidth than AM because the number of extra sidebands that occur in an fm
transmission is directly related to the amplitude and frequency of the audio signal.
