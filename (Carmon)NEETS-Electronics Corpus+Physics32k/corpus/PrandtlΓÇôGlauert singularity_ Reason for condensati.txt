The reason for the condensation cloud that is being observed is that humid air is entering a low-pressure region, which also reduces local density and temperature sufficiently to cause condensation. The vapour vanishes as soon as the pressure increases again to ambient levels. In the case of objects at transonic speeds, the pressure increase happens at the shock wave location. Condensation in free flows does not require supersonic flow. Given a humidity high enough, it can happen in purely subsonic flow over a wing or in the cores of wing tip and other vortices. This can often be observed on humid days on aircraft approaching an airport.
