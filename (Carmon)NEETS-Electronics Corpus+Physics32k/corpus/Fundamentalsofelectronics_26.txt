In the communications model, the source produces a signal that will be absorbed by the sink. Examples
of time-domain signals produced by a source are music, speech, and characters typed on a keyboard. Signals
can also be functions of two variables—an image is a signal that depends on two spatial variables—or more—
television pictures (video signals) are functions of two spatial variables and time. Thus, information sources
produce signals. In physical systems, each signal corresponds to an electrical voltage or current.
To be able to design systems, we must understand electrical science and technology. However, we ﬁrst need
to understand the big picture to appreciate the context in which the electrical engineer works.
