Since speech signals are periodic, speech has a Fourier series representation given by a linear circuit’s response
to a periodic signal (4.27). Because the acoustics of the vocal tract are linear, we know that the spectrum of
the output equals the product of the pitch signal’s spectrum and the vocal tract’s frequency response. We
thus obtain the fundamental model of speech production.
