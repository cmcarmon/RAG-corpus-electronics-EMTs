Since the time constant of the circuit is 10 microseconds and the pulse duration is 100 microseconds, 
the time constant is short (1/10 of the pulse duration). The capacitor is charged exponentially through the 
resistor. In 5 time constants, the capacitor will be, for all practical purposes, completely charged. At the 
first time constant, the capacitor is charged to 63.2 volts, at the second 86.5 volts, at the third 95 volts, at 
the fourth 98 volts, and finally at the end of the fifth time constant (50 microseconds), the capacitor is 
fully charged. This is shown in figure 4-36.
