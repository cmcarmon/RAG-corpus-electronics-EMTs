Buffers (Fig. 10.9) 
 
Buffers  do  not  affect  the  logical  state  of  a  digital 
signal (i.e. a logic 1 input results in a logic 1 output 
whereas a logic 0 input results in a logic 0 output). 
Buffers are normally used to provide extra current 
drive  at  the  output  but  can  also  be  used  to 
regularize  the  logic  levels  present  at  an  interface. 
The  Boolean  expression  for  the  output,  Y, of  a 
buffer with an input, X, is: 
 
Y = X
