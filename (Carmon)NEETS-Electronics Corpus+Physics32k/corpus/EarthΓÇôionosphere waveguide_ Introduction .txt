Radio propagation within the ionosphere depends on frequency, angle of incidence, time of day, season, Earth's magnetic field, and solar activity. At vertical incidence, waves with frequencies larger than the electron plasma frequency (fe) of the F-layer maximum
(1)   fe = 9 (Ne)1/2 kHz
(Ne in cm−3 is the electron density) can propagate through the ionosphere nearly undisturbed. Waves with frequencies smaller than fe are reflected within the ionospheric D-, E-, and F-layers. fe is of the order of 8–15 MHz during day time conditions. For oblique incidence, the critical frequency becomes larger.
Very low frequencies (VLF: 3–30 kHz), and extremely low frequencies (ELF: <3  kHz) are reflected at the ionospheric D- and lower E-layer. An exception is whistler propagation of lightning signals along the geomagnetic field lines.
The wavelengths of VLF waves (10–100 km) are already comparable with the height of the ionospheric D-layer (about 70 km during the day, and 90  km during the night). Therefore, ray theory is only applicable for propagation over short distances, while mode theory must be used for larger distances. The region between Earth's surface and the ionospheric D-layer behaves thus like a waveguide for VLF- and ELF-waves.
In the presence of the ionospheric plasma and the geomagnetic field, electromagnetic waves exist for frequencies which are larger than the gyrofrequency of the ions (about 1 Hz). Waves with frequencies smaller than the gyrofrequency are called hydromagnetic waves. The geomagnetic pulsations with periods of seconds to minutes as well as Alfvén waves belong to that type of waves.
