Example 1.20 
 
A voltage drop of 4 V appears across a resistor of 
100 <. What power is dissipated in the resistor? 
 
Solution 
 
Here  we  use  P = V 2 / R (where  V = 4 V and  
R = 100 <). 
 
P = V 2 / R = (4 V Ã— 4 V) / 100 < = 0.16 W 
 
Hence the resistor dissipates a power of 0.16 W (or 
160 mW).
