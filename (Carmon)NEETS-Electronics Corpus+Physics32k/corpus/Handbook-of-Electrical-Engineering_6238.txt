In the process and apparatus of the present invention, light from all portions of the object whose image is
to be transmitted, is focused at one time upon a light sensitive plate of a photo-electrical cell to thereby develop
an electronic discharge from said plate, in which each portion of the cross-section of such electronic discharge
will correspond in electrical intensity with the intensity of light imposed on that portion of the sensitive plate
from which the electrical discharge originated. Such a discharge is herein termed an electrical image.
