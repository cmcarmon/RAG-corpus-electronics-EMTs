Frequency measurements are an essential part of preventive and corrective maintenance for 
communication and electronic equipment. Rotation frequencies of some mechanical devices must be 
determined; the output frequency of electric power generators is checked when the engine is started and 
during preventive maintenance routines; carrier equipment that operates in the audio-frequency range 
must be adjusted to operate at the correct frequencies; and radio transmitters must be accurately tuned to 
the assigned frequencies to provide reliable communications and to avoid interfering with radio circuits 
operating on other frequencies. These are only a few of the applications for making frequency 
measurements.
