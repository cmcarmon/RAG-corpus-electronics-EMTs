According to one Puranic astronomical estimate, the four Yuga have the following durations:
Satya Yuga equals 1,728,000 Human years
Treta Yuga equals 1,296,000 Human years
Dvapara Yuga equals 864,000 Human years
Kali Yuga equals 432,000 Human years
Together, these four yuga constitute one Mahayuga and equal 4.32 million human years. According to one version, there are 1,000 Mahayugas in one day of Brahma or 4.32 billion human years. A Mahakalpa consists of 100 years of Brahma.
According to Srimad Bhagavatam 3.11.19, which is dated around the 400–500 BC, the Yugas are much longer, using a divine year in which one day is equal to one human year, thus:

one year of the demigods is equal to 360 years of the human beings. The duration of the Satya-yuga is therefore 4,800 x 360, or 1,728,000 years. The duration of the Tretā-yuga is 3,600 x 360, or 1,296,000 years. The duration of the Dvāpara-yuga is 2,400 x 360, or 864,000 years.

The Viṣṇu Purāṇa Time measurement section of the Viṣṇu Purāṇa Book I Chapter III adds:
2 Ayanas (6-month periods, see above) = 1 human year or 1 day of the devas.
12,000 divine years = 4 Yugas (= 4,320,000 human years) = 1 Mahā-Yuga (also is equal to 12,000 Daiva (divine) Yuga).
2*12,000 = 24,000 divine year = 12000 revolutions of sun around its dual.
While the long yuga count is the most popular, it does not correlate to any known celestial motion found in the Astronomical Almanac. The value of 24,000 years fits relatively close with the modern astronomical calculation of one full precession of the equinox, which takes 25,772 years. Thus the yuga cycle may have some basis in known terrestrial cycles. Srimad Bhagavatam 3.11.19 describes the timespans of the demigods, in which a year of a yuga is a year of the demigods. It is this second sloka which appears to have been modified over the years.
