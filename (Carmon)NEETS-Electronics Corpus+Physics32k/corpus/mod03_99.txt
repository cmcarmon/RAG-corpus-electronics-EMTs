Current flow in either direction through the three coils causes a magnetic field to exist between the
field coils. The current in the moving coil causes it to act as a magnet and exert a turning force against a
spring. If the current is reversed, the field polarity and the polarity of the moving coil reverse at the same
time, and the turning force continues in the original direction. Since reversing the current direction does
not reverse the turning force, this type of meter can be used to measure both ac and dc if the scale is
changed. While some voltmeters and ammeters use the electrodynamic principle of operation, the most
important application is in the wattmeter. The wattmeter, along with the voltmeter and the ammeter, will
be discussed later in this topic.
