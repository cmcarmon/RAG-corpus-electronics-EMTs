System could be of two types, hardware or software, system connects all the variables and input that are triggered and sent by an operator to produce certain output that the system designer has made the system to do. Output could have many different types, in software systems the output is usually sound/picture and sometimes certain motion outputs as vibration or movement, in hardware system the output can be very different and related to the system purpose (e.g. electrical output) that activates different triggers of the system to do its purpose. Many of the modern systems connect both the hardware and software system in order to manage different purposes (e.g. smartphone).
