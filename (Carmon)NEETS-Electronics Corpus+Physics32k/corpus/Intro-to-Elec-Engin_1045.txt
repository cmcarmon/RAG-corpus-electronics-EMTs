Whereas detailed differences and particularly challenging problems emerge among various ma-
chine types, this section brieﬂy touches on the interrelated problems that are common to all
machine types, such as losses and efﬁciency, ventilation and cooling, machine ratings, magnetic
saturation, leakage and harmonic ﬂuxes, and machine applications. Various standards, developed
by IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), NEMA (National Electrical Man-
ufacturers Association), ANSI (American National Standards Institute), and IEC (International
Electrotechnical Commission), deal with machine ratings, insulation and allowable temperature
rise, testing methods, losses, and efﬁciency determination.
