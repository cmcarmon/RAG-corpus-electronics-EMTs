To start a practical synchronous motor, the stator is energized, but the dc supply to the rotor field is
not energized. The squirrel-cage windings bring the rotor to near synchronous speed. At that point, the dc
field is energized. This locks the rotor in step with the rotating stator field. Full torque is developed, and
the load is driven. A mechanical switching device that operates on centrifugal force is often used to apply
dc to the rotor as synchronous speed is reached.
