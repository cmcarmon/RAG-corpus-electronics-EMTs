Let us consider the following example:
Two forces are pushing an object along the ground. One force is 10 N [W] and the other is 8.0 N [S]. For calculating the equilibrant for the given situation.
By using Pythagoras' theorem,




c

a

+

b

{\displaystyle c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}}





c

{\displaystyle c^{2}}
= 10^2 + 8^2
So, c = 13 N
For calculating the angle where the 8.0 N force and the equilibrant touch,
tanΘ =

Hence, Θ = 51°
The equilibrant is 13 N [N51°E].
