Using Newton's second law, the force exerted by body 2 on body 1 is







F



12


=

m

a

.




{\displaystyle {\mathbf {F}}_{12}=m_{1}{\mathbf {a}}_{1}.\!\,}

The force exerted by body 1 on body 2 is







F



21


=

m

2





a



2


.




{\displaystyle {\mathbf {F}}_{21}=m_{2}{\mathbf {a}}_{2}.\!\,}

According to Newton's third law, the force that body 2 exerts on body 1 is equal and opposite to the force that body 1 exerts on body 2:







F



12


=
−



F



21


.




{\displaystyle {\mathbf {F}}_{12}=-{\mathbf {F}}_{21}.\!\,}

Therefore,

.




{\displaystyle m_{1}{\mathbf {a}}_{1}=-m_{2}{\mathbf {a}}_{2}.\!\,}

and

=
−

m

a

.




{\displaystyle {\mathbf {a}}_{2}=-{m_{1} \over m_{2}}{\mathbf {a}}_{1}.\!\,}

The relative acceleration arel between the two bodies is given by

{\displaystyle {\mathbf {a}}_{\rm {rel}}={\mathbf {a}}_{1}-{\mathbf {a}}_{2}=\left(1+{\frac {m_{1}}{m_{2}}}\right){\mathbf {a}}_{1}={\frac {m_{2}+m_{1}}{m_{1}m_{2}}}m_{1}{\mathbf {a}}_{1}={\frac {{\mathbf {F}}_{12}}{\mu }}.}

So we conclude that body 1 moves with respect to the position of body 2 as a body of mass equal to the reduced mass.
