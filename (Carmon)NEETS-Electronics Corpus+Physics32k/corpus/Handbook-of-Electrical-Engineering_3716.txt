The  most  common  way  to  model  the  readback  process  is  to  use  the  principle  of  reciprocity,  which  states
that the ﬂux produced by the head through a cross section of an element of the medium, normalized by the
number of ampere turns of current driving the head, is equal to the ﬂux produced in the head by the element
of medium, normalized by the equivalent current required to produce the magnetization of that element. For
a magnetic recording head, which produces the longitudinal ﬁeld Hx(x,y) when driven by NI ampere turns of
current,  this  principle  leads  to  the  following  expression  for  the  voltage  induced  in  the  head  by  a  recording
medium with magnetization M(x,y) and moving with velocity v relative to the head:
