Continuous signals (shown in Figure 6.0.1) are described by time functions which are deﬁned
for all values of t (a continuous variable). Commercial broadcast systems, analog computers,
and various control and instrumentation systems process continuous signals. The information
processed in analog systems is contained in the time function which deﬁnes the signal. Analog
systems are often thought of as performing signal processing in the frequency domain.
