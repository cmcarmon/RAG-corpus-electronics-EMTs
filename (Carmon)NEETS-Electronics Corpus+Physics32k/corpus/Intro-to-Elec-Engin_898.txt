It would be appropriate for the reader to review the material on transformers in Section 1.2.
Transformers come in various sizes, from very small, weighing only a few ounces, to very
large, weighing hundreds of tons. The ratings of transformers cover a very wide range. Whereas
transformers applied with electronic circuits and systems usually have ratings of 300 VA or less,
power-system transformers used in transmission and distribution systems have the highest volt-
ampere ratings (a few kVA to several MVA) as well as the highest continuous voltage ratings.
Instrument transformers (potential transformers and current transformers) with very small volt-
ampere ratings are used in instruments for sensing voltages or currents in power systems.
