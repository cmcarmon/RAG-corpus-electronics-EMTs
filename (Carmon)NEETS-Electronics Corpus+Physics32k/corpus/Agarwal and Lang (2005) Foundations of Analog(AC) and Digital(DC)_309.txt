We will now tackle several circuits called dividers that are slightly more complex
than the simplest single-loop, two-node, two-element circuits of the previous
section. These circuits will comprise a single loop and three or more elements,
or two nodes and three or more elements. Dividers produce fractions of input
currents or voltages and will be encountered often in subsequent chapters. For
the moment, however, they are good examples on which to practice circuit
analysis, and we can use them to gain important insight into circuit behavior.
