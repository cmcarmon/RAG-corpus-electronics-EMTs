. The ﬂoppy disk drive, also known as diskette, is a remov-
able magnetic storage medium that allows recording of
data. IBM ﬁrst introduced it as a 8-in diskette in 1971.
In the middle of 1970s, a 5.25 diskette was introduced.
Today, the most commonly used ﬂoppy disks are 3.5
inches and have the capacity of 800 KB to 2.8 MB (with
a standard of 1.44 MB).
