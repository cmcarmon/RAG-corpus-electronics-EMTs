The space translation operator

{\displaystyle {\widehat {T}}(\Delta \mathbf {r} )}
acts on a wavefunction to shift the space coordinates by an infinitesimal displacement Δr. The explicit expression






T

{\displaystyle {\widehat {T}}}
can be quickly determined by a Taylor expansion of ψ(r + Δr, t) about r, then (keeping the first order term and neglecting second and higher order terms), replace the space derivatives by the momentum operator







p

{\displaystyle {\widehat {\mathbf {p} }}}
. Similarly for the time translation operator acting on the time parameter, the Taylor expansion of ψ(r, t + Δt) is about t, and the time derivative replaced by the energy operator






E

{\displaystyle {\widehat {E}}}
.

The exponential functions arise by definition as those limits, due to Euler, and can be understood physically and mathematically as follows. A net translation can be composed of many small translations, so to obtain the translation operator for a finite increment, replace Δr by Δr/N and Δt by Δt/N, where N is a positive non-zero integer. Then as N increases, the magnitude of Δr and Δt become even smaller, while leaving the directions unchanged. Acting the infinitesimal operators on the wavefunction N times and taking the limit as N tends to infinity gives the finite operators.
Space and time translations commute, which means the operators and generators commute.

For a time-independent Hamiltonian, energy is conserved in time and quantum states are stationary states: the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian are the energy eigenvalues E:
