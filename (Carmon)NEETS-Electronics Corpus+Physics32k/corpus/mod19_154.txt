Wavelength is the distance in space occupied by one cycle of a radio wave at any given instant. If a 
radio wave could be frozen in time and measured, the distance from the leading edge of one cycle to the 
leading edge of the next cycle would be the wavelength. Wavelength varies from a few hundredths of an 
inch at the high frequencies to many miles at extremely low frequencies. Common practice is to express 
wavelength in meters. The Greek letter lambda (Î») is used to signify wavelength. Formulas for 
wavelength, period, and velocity are shown below.
