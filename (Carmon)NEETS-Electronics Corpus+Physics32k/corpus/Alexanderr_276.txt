6.1
So  far  we  have  limited  our  study  to  resistive  circuits.  In  this  chapter,
we  shall  introduce  two  new  and  important  passive  linear  circuit  ele-
ments: the capacitor and the inductor. Unlike resistors, which dissipate
energy,  capacitors  and  inductors  do  not  dissipate  but  store  energy,
which can be retrieved at a later time. For this reason, capacitors and
inductors are called storage elements.
