{\displaystyle \mathrm {Ra} _{x}={\frac {g\beta }{\nu \alpha }}(T_{s}-T_{\infty })x^{3}=\mathrm {Gr} _{x}\mathrm {Pr} }

where:
x is the characteristic length
Rax is the Rayleigh number for characteristic length x
g is acceleration due to gravity
β is the thermal expansion coefficient (equals to 1/T, for ideal gases, where T is absolute temperature).




ν


{\displaystyle \nu }
is the kinematic viscosity
α is the thermal diffusivity
Ts is the surface temperature
T∞ is the quiescent temperature (fluid temperature far from the surface of the object)
Grx is the Grashof number for characteristic length x
Pr is the Prandtl number
In the above, the fluid properties Pr, ν, α and β are evaluated at the film temperature, which is defined as:

{\displaystyle \mathrm {Ra} _{x}^{*}={\frac {g\beta q''_{o}}{\nu \alpha k}}x^{4}}

where:
q"o is the uniform surface heat flux
k is the thermal conductivity.
For most engineering purposes, the Rayleigh number is large, somewhere around 106 to 108.
