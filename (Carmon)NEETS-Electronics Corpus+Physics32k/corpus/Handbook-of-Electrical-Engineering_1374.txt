signals, which is composed of several consecutive 20- to 40-msec segments of that signal, is obtained from the
sequence of AR models for the individual segments. Thus, a linear time-varying AR model is assumed for each
sample  function  of  the  speech  signal.  This  model,  however,  is  slowly  varying  in  accordance  with  the  slow
temporal  variation  of  the  articulatory  system.  It  was  found  that  a  set  of  approximately  2048  prototype  AR
models can reliably represent all segments of speech signals. The AR models are useful in representing the short
time spectrum of the signal, since the spectrum of the excitation signal is white. Thus, the set of AR models
represents a set of 2048 spectral prototypes for the speech signal.
