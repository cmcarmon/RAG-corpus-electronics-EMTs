transistors. The physical construction of ICs is the prime reason for this different approach. The most
frequently used ICs are manufactured with either 14 or 16 pins, all of which may be soldered directly into
the circuit. It can be quite a job for you to unsolder all of these pins, even with the special tools designed
for this purpose. After unsoldering all of the pins, you then have the tedious job of cleaning and
straightening all of them.
