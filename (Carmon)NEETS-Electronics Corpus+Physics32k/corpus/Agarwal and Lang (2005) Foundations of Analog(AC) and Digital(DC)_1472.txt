It was shown in Section 10.1.4 that when the time constant of an RC circuit
becomes much longer than the period of a periodic input signal, the capacitor
voltage begins to approximate the integral of the input wave. Let us examine this
property in more detail by finding the response of the RC circuit in Figure 10.36
when the input is a short pulse of amplitude Vp and duration tp.
