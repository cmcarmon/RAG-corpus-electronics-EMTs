The current oﬀsets at the inverting and non-inverting input terminals are usually base
currents into two identical bipolar transistors. Thus their diﬀerence can be expected to be
much less than either base current alone. Using this fact the student should be able to
explain the reason for having an extra resistor between the non-inverting input and ground
for the inverting ampliﬁer. The resistor should have a value equal to the input resistor and
feedback resistor in parallel.
We deﬁne the following:
