The  total  radiated  power,  Pr,  can  be  determined  from  the  electric  and  magnetic  ﬁelds  by  integrating  the
expression 1/2 Re {E · H* · a r} over a surface of radius r. Carrying out this integration yields Pr = 36.565 |I0|2.
The radiation resistance of the half-wave dipole can then be determined from
