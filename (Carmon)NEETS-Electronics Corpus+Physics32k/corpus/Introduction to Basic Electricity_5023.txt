how this can simplify routing.
It is useful to use a color-coded system to  simplify 
the presentation of a double-sided printed circuit 
board during the design process. This process is 
 standard with computer-generated designs. It can also 
be done with colored pencils. A typical color-code 
 system is as follows:
	● Black—board outline, holes, pads, and hardware
	● Green—component electrical symbols and outlines
	● Red—connecting traces on the component side
	● Blue—connecting traces on the trace side
	● Yellow—through holes
