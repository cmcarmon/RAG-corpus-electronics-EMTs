The second basic fact you must understand is that FOR EVERY DIFFERENT COMBINATION OF
ANGLES IN A TRIANGLE, THERE IS A DEFINITE RATIO BETWEEN THE LENGTHS OF THE
THREE SIDES. Consider the triangle in figure   V-2, consisting of the base, side B; the altitude, side A;
and the hypotenuse, side C. (The hypotenuse is always the longest side, and is always opposite the 90ยบ 
angle.)
