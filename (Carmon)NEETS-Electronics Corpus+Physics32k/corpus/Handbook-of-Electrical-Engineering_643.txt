The  principal  drawback  of  DCSK  arises  from  the  fact  that  the  correlation  is  performed  over  half  the  bit
duration. Compared to conventional techniques where the elements of the signal set are available at the receiver,
DCSK has half of the data rate, and only half the bit energy contributes to its noise performance [4,6].
