Getting even closer to fundamental events at the cellular level, both signals A and B (Table 113.2) were used
to  expose  cultured  mouse  bone  cells  and  mouse  skin  ﬁbroblasts,  as  well  as  explanted  mouse  pineal  cells  in
organ culture [Luben, 1993]. In all three cases various chemical procedures were employed to examine “beta-
adrenergic receptors.” These are cell surface protein strands that span the cell membrane and emerge from it;
they mediate cell response to agents such as epinephrine (= adrenaline) or norepinephrine through so-called
G proteins which act essentially as molecular ampliﬁers at the interior surface of the cell. Other G proteins are
involved in the response to growth factors. The arrangement of the exposure coils and culture plates was such
as to give mean electric ﬁelds equal to about one-tenth of the values shown in Table 113.3. Exposures were of
4  h  duration.  Speciﬁc  types  of  G  proteins  were  stimulated  by  the A  signal,  others  by  the  B  signal.  The  total
number of binding sites on the cells was not affected, but the afﬁnity of the receptors for speciﬁc hormones
was  changed,  suggesting  a  change  in  receptor  conformation.  It  is  interesting  to  compare  this  work,  which
employed peak values of the order of 10–2 V/m and time average values not greater than 2 (10–3) V/m, with
