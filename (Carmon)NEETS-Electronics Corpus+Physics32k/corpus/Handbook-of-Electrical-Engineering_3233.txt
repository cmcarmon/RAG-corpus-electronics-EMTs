Often a drive may need only a one- or two-quadrant mode of operation. In such a case, the converter topology
can be simple. For example, in one-quadrant drive, only Q2 chopping and D3 freewheeling devices are required,
and the terminal A is connected to the supply positive. Similarly, a two-quadrant drive will need only one leg
of  the  bridge,  where  the  upper  device  can  be  controlled  for  motoring  mode  and  the  lower  device  can  be
controlled for regeneration mode.
