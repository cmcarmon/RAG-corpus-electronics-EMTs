As you can see, the tube conducts on the positive alternations. As soon as the input signal voltage
reaches 0 volts, the tube cuts off. The tube will remain cut off until the input signal voltage climbs above
zero volts on the next positive alternation. Because the tube conducts during the entire positive
alternation, but not on the negative alternation, the tube conducts for only half the input cycle duration.
