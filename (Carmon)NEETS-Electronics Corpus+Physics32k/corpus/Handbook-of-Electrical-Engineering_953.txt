Least-Square Curve Fitting (Numerical)
For  almost  all  practical  applications  we  are  forced  to  do  least-squares  curve  ﬁtting  numerically,  because  the
analytic solutions as previously discussed are not obtainable in closed form. What we are calling least-squares
curve ﬁtting is more generally known as nonlinear optimization. Many ﬁne references on this topic are available.
We refer the reader to [Gill et al., 1981] for details.
