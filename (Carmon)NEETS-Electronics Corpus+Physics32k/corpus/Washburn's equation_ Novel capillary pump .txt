The flow behaviour in traditional capillary follows the Washburn's equation. Recently, novel capillary pumps with a constant pumping flow rate independent of the liquid viscosity  were developed, which have a significant advantage over the traditional capillary pump (of which the flow behaviour is Washburn behaviour, namely the flow rate is not constant). These new concepts of capillary pump are of great potential to improve the performance of lateral flow test.
