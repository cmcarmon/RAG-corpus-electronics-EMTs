Note how in this ﬁgure the signal s (t) is deﬁned in the frequency domain. To ﬁnd its time domain
representation, we simply use the inverse Fourier transform.
Exercise 4.14
(Solution on p. 140.)
What is the signal s (t) that corresponds to the spectrum shown in the upper panel of Figure 4.12?
Exercise 4.15
(Solution on p. 140.)
What is the power in x (t), the amplitude-modulated signal? Try the calculation in both the time
and frequency domains.
