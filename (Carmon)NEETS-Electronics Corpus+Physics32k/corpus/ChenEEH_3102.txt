There are three possible sources of torque: the change in the
self-inductance of winding 1 with position, the change of
the self-inductance of winding 2 with position, and the change
of the mutual inductance with position. In an electric machine,
one, two, or all three of these effects may be involved. Figure
4.9(A) shows a double salient structure in which all three
effects are in operation. With winding 1 excited alone, there
is a torque due to the position dependence of the winding
1 self-inductance. The torque will be in a direction to maxi-
mize L11 and thus make the air gap smaller. Similarly,
if
winding 2 is excited alone, a torque is obtained due to the
variation of L22. If both windings are excited together, there is
also a torque due to the variation of the mutual inductance L12.
Figures 4.9(B) and 4.9(C) show the case of a single salient
structure (one self and one mutual term) and a nonsalient
structure (only the mutual term).
