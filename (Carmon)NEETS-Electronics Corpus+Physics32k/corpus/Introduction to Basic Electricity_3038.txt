The resistance of the P and N materials and the 
external resistance of the circuit limits the cur-
rent that flows when a diode is forward biased. The 
 diode resistance is small. Therefore, connecting a 
voltage directly to a forward-biased diode creates a 
large current flow. This can generate enough heat to 
 destroy the diode. To limit the forward current flow, 
an  external resistor must be connected in series with 
the diode.
