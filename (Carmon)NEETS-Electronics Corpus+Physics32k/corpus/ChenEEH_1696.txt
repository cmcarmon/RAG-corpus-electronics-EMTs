In an effort to cut back on the huge amount of data available
for processing and to emphasize the fact that in video shots,
while objects may appear or disappear, the background stays
much the same and follows the camera motion in one shot, Oh
et al. (2000) have proposed a background tracking (BGT)
approach. A strip along the top, left, and right borders of the
frame, covering around 20% of frame area, is taken as a Ô¨Åxed
background area (FBA). A signature 1-D vector called trans-
formed background area (TBA) formed from the Gaussian
pyramid representation of the FBA is computed. Background
tracking is achieved by a 1-D correlation matching between
two TBAs obtained from successive frames. Shot detection is
declared if the background tracking fails as characterized by a
decrease in the correlation matching parameter. This approach
