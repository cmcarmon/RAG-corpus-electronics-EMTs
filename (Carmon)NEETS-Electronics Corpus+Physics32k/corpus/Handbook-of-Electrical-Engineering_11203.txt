Commonly used scalp electrodes consist of Ag-AgCl disks, 1 to 3 mm in diameter, with a very ﬂexible long
lead that can be plugged into an ampliﬁer. Although it is desirable to obtain a low-impedance contact at the
), this objective is confounded by hair and the difﬁculty of mechanically
electrode ski interface (less than 10 k
stabilizing the electrodes. Conductive electrode paste helps obtain low impedance and keep the electrodes in
place. A type of cement (collodion) is used to ﬁx small patches of gauze over electrodes for mechanical stability,
and leads are usually taped to the subject to provide some strain relief. Slight abrasion of the skin is sometimes
used to obtain better electrode impedances, but this can cause irritation and sometimes infection (as well as
pain in sensitive subjects).
