A Skylark tower is a tower used for the launch of earlier versions of Skylark rockets. As Skylark rockets have no guidance system and accelerate slowly, they require a safe launch tower with a height of at least 24 metres with a guidance system.
Later versions of the Skylark rocket were equipped with a more powerful engine and therefore did not need such a large guidance tower for launch.
