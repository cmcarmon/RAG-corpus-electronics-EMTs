To maintain the highest possible audio quality, program material would be broadcast from digital sources,
such as CD players and digital audio recorders, or digital audio feeds from network sources. Analog sources,
such as microphones, are converted to a digital audio data stream using an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter,
prior to switching or summation with the other digital sources.
