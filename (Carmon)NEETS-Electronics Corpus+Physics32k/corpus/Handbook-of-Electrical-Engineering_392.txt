network  graph  theory)  is  a  study  of  (electrical)  networks  in  connection  with  their  nonmetric  geometrical
(namely topological) properties by investigating the interconnections between the branches and the nodes of
the networks. Such a study will lead to important results in network theory such as algorithms for formulating
network equations and the proofs of various basic network theorems [Chan, 1969; Seshu and Reed, 1961].
