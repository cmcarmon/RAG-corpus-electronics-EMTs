October - December 1963: Cricketsonde flights were conducted at the Otis Air Force Base, Massachusetts, to determine the operational feasibility of the system. The results indicated "that the Cricketsonde had a good potential as an operational system."
1964 or 1965 - At the request of a Texaco representative, the Cricketsonde was given operational tests with inconclusive results by WO Gary Meyers, USMC and members of the Marine Corps aerological staff at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina. Later, the Cricketsonde was tested on a field exercise at Page Field, Parris Idland, South Carolina. Recollections of LtCol Gary Meyers, USMC Ret.
August 1966, August 1968: The Cricketsonde system was used in conjunction with lidar to make vertical temperature and humidity structure observations. These observations were used to examine any relationship between vertical distribution of atmospheric aerosols and the vertical profiles of temperature and humidity, the purpose being to explore the utility of optical radar to detect and measure meteorological features of the lower atmosphere, such as temperature inversions, haze and smog layers, and humidity variations.
