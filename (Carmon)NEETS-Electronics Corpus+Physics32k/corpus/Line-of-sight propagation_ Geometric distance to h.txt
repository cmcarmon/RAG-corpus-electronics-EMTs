Assuming a perfect sphere with no terrain irregularity, the distance to the horizon from a high altitude transmitter (i.e., line of sight) can readily be calculated.
Let R be the radius of the Earth and h be the altitude of a telecommunication station. The line of sight distance d of this station is given by the Pythagorean theorem;

{\displaystyle d^{2}=(R+h)^{2}-R^{2}=2\cdot R\cdot h+h^{2}}

Since the altitude of the station is much less than the radius of the Earth,

{\displaystyle d\approx {\sqrt {2\cdot R\cdot h}}}

If the height is given in metres, and distance in kilometres,

{\displaystyle d\approx 3.57\cdot {\sqrt {h}}}

If the height is given in feet, and the distance in miles,
