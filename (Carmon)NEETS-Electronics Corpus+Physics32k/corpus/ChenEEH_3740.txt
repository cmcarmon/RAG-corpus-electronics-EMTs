Transition costs are sometimes explicitly or implicitly used to
control the general trend of the candidate paths as well as the
local trajectories at each step along a path.15 For example, a
horizontal transition into a node corresponds to the association
of two sequential test frames with a single reference frame,
whereas a unity slope transition into a node corresponds to
the pairing of sequential frames in both the test and reference
strings. The latter may be given a lower cost, for example, to
promote a more linear path. Such local costs are often depend-
ent on the short-term history of the path (e.g., one or two steps
back) so that, for example, excessive numbers of test string
features are not associated with a single reference feature vector.
In addition to the local trajectory costs, hard constraints (effect-
ively inﬁnite transition costs) are placed on the search. These
may include, for example, strict endpoint matching constraints
[nodes (1, 1) and (I, J) must appear on any valid path] and a
monotonicity requirement that a path may never take a ‘‘west-
ward’’ trajectory at any step. The latter requirement ensures
proper time sequencing of events in the utterance. These
‘‘soft’’ and ‘‘hard’’ local constraints on path trajectories imply
global constraints on the overall search space. In turn, the
restricted search space implies computational savings as certain
node costs need not be computed. For further details on local
and global constraints and conditions, see Deller et al. (2000),
Rabiner and Juang (1993), and Myers et al. (1980).
