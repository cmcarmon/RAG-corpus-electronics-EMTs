An idealized conductor, also known as a perfect electric con-
ductor (PEC), is deﬁned as a material that allows charges to
move freely through its body and on its surface so that (a) the
charges move to the conﬁguration of least energy and (b) the
surface of the conductor is an equipotential. At zero frequency,
all conductors behave as perfect conductors because all charges
placed or induced upon them have inﬁnite time available to
migrate to the surface. Therefore, for the purposes of electro-
statics, all conductors are PECs and will be labeled as such in
the ﬁgures to follow. When the conductor’s surface is an
equipotential, by the orthogonality of the system of lines
described previously, all the electric ﬁeld lines enter its surface
at 908. Therefore, another deﬁnition of a conductor is a state-
ment of a boundary condition: a conductor is a surface on
which the tangential component of the E ﬁeld must vanish.
