Electromechanical energy converters, simply known as electric machines, embody three essential
features: (1) an electric system, (2) a mechanical system, and (3) a coupling Ô¨Åeld. Figure 12.1.1
is a schematic representation of an ideal electric machine (or a lossless electromechanical device)
for which the following relations hold:
