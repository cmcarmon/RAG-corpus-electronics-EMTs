If one looks at a one-centimeter object at a distance of one meter and a two-centimeter object at a distance of two meters, both subtend the same visual angle of about 0.01 rad or 0.57°. Thus they have the same retinal image size



R
≈
0.17

mm



{\displaystyle R\approx 0.17{\text{ mm}}}
.
That is just a bit larger than the retinal image size for the moon, which is about



0.15

mm



{\displaystyle 0.15{\text{ mm}}}
, because, with



S
=
2160

miles



{\displaystyle S=2160{\text{ miles}}}
, and



D


{\displaystyle D}
averaging



238
,
000

miles



{\displaystyle 238,000{\text{ miles}}}
,



V
≈
0.009

rad



{\displaystyle V\approx 0.009{\text{ rad}}}




≈
0.52

deg



{\displaystyle \approx 0.52{\text{ deg}}}
.
Also, for some easy observations, if one holds one's index finger at arm's length, the width of the index fingernail subtends approximately one degree, and the width of the thumb at the first joint subtends approximately two degrees.
Therefore, if one is interested in the performance of the eye or the first processing steps in the visual cortex, it does not make sense to refer to the absolute size of a viewed object (its linear size



S


{\displaystyle S}
). What matters is the visual angle



V


{\displaystyle V}
which determines the size of the retinal image.
