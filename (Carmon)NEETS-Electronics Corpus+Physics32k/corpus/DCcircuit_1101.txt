As was stated before, the voltage produced by any particular kind of cell is determined
strictly by the chemistry of that cell type. The size of the cell is irrelevant to its voltage. To
obtain greater voltage than the output of a single cell, multiple cells must be connected in
series. The total voltage of a battery is the sum of all cell voltages. A typical automotive
lead-acid battery has six cells, for a nominal voltage output of 6 x 2.0 or 12.0 volts:
