Bipolar transistors typically have three wire leads so you can access the 
base, collector, and emitter of the transistor. One exception to this is a pho-
totransistor (which I discuss in Chapter 12), which is packaged in a clear case 
and has just two leads (collector and emitter) — light is used to bias the tran-
sistor, so you don’t have to apply a voltage to the base. All FETs have leads 
for the source, drain, and gate, and some include a fourth lead so you can 
ground the transistor’s case to the chassis of your circuit, or for the second 
gate of a dual‐gate MOSFET.
