Shot noise is noise due to electron and hole ﬂuctuations in
any device with an average dc current ﬂow. Flicker noise (1/f
noise) is noise due to a variety of sources that exhibits a 1=f a
dependence, where a is close to one. At microwave frequencies,
the contribution of ﬂicker noise is usually negligible with respect
to other noise mechanisms. Its contribution can be signiﬁcant
for some microwave devices operated below 50 MHz.
