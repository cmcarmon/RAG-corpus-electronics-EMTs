It requires the use of the borrow; that is, you cannot subtract 8 from 5 and have a positive difference.
You must borrow a 1, which is really one group of 10. Then, one group of 10 plus five groups of 1 equal
15, and 15 minus 8 leaves a difference of 7. The 2 was reduced by 1 by the borrow; and since nothing is
to be subtracted from it, it is brought down to the difference.
