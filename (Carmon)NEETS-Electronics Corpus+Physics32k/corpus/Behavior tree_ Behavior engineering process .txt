BEHAVIOR TREES provide a vehicle for growing a shared understanding of a complex system.
The role of the COMPOSITION TREE in the overall process is to provide a vehicle for overcoming the imperfect knowledge associated with the large set of requirements for a system.
Process used - (critical)
BEHAVIOR ENGINEERING uses behavior trees to control complexity while growing a shared understanding of a complex system.
That shared, holistic understanding of a complex system, because it integrates the requirements, shows the emergent behavior of the system implied by requirements.
