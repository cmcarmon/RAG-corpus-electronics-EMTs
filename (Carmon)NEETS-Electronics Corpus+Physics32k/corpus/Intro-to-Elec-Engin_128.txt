A typical strain gauge, shown in Figure 1.7.1, consists of a metal foil (such as nickel–copper
alloy) which is formed by a photoetching process in multiple conductors aligned with the direction
of the strain to be measured. The conductors are usually bonded to a thin backing made out of
a tough ﬂexible plastic. The backing ﬁlm, in turn, is attached to the test structure by a suitable
adhesive.
