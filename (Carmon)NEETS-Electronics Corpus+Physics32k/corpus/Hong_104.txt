The first order analysis of op amp circuits can be made following two simple rules: 
(1)  the  plus  and  minus  terminals  draw  no  current;  and  (2)  the  output  will  produce 
whatever voltage is necessary to equalize the voltages at the plus and minus terminals. 
The prerequisites for using these rules are that the op amp must be in negative feedback 
and the required output must be within the valid output range of the op amp.
