lags the primary voltage
ep. Secondary voltage e1 is nearer in phase with primary voltage e, while e2 is shifted further out of phase
with ep. The vector sum of e1 and ep is larger than that of e2 and ep. Therefore, the voltage applied to the
cathode of CR1 is greater than the voltage applied to the anode of CR2 above resonance.
