PF plays an important role in power systems. The product of
V and I is called the apparent power. The investment cost
of a utility depends on the voltage level and the current carried
by the conductors. Higher current needs larger, more expen-
sive conductors. Higher voltage means more insulation costs.
The revenue of a utility is generally based on the amount of
energy in Kilowatt per hour sold. At low power factors, the
revenue is low since power P and energy sold is less. For
getting full beneÔ¨Åt of investment, the utility would like to sell
the highest possible energy, that is, operate at unity power
factor all the time. Utilities can have a tariff structure that
penalizes the customer for low power factor. Most electromag-
netic equipment such as motors have low lagging PF and
absorb large reactive powers. By connecting capacitors across
the terminals of the motor, part or all of the reactive power
absorbed by the motor can be supplied by the capacitors. The
reactive power from the supply will be reduced, and the supply
PF improved. Cost of the capacitors is balanced against the
savings accrued due to PF improvement.
