Seeing the light
Many electronic components behave differently depending on the light they 
are exposed to. Manufacturers make certain versions of components to 
exploit this light sensitivity, enclosing them in clear cases so you can use 
them as sensors in equipment such as burglar alarms, smoke detectors, 
automatic dusk‐to‐dawn lighting, and safety devices that stop your electri-
cally controlled garage door from descending when a cat runs under it. You 
can also use them for communications between your remote control, which 
sends coded instructions via infrared light using a light‐emitting diode (LED, 
which I discuss in Chapter 9), and your TV or DVD player, which contains a 
light‐sensitive diode or transistor to receive the coded instructions.
