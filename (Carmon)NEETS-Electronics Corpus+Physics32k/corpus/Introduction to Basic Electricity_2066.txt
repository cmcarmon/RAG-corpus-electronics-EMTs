To solve for total resistance (RT), first find the 
equivalent resistance (RA) for parallel resistors R2 and 
R3. Then solve for the equivalent resistance of resistors 
RA and R4 (identified as RS1) and R5 and R6 (identified 
as RS2). Then the equivalent resistance (RBTS) can be 
determined for RS1 and RS2. Finally, find the total se-
ries resistance for R1 and RB.
