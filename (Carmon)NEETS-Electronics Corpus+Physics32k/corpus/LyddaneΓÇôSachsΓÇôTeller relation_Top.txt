In condensed matter physics, the Lyddane–Sachs–Teller relation (or LST relation) determines the ratio of the natural frequency of longitudinal optic lattice vibrations (phonons) (




ω

L




{\displaystyle \omega _{L}}
) of an ion crystal to the natural frequency of the transverse optical lattice vibration (




ω

T




{\displaystyle \omega _{T}}
) for long wavelengths (zero wavevector). The ratio is equal to the ratio of the static permittivity

{\displaystyle \varepsilon _{st}}
(Often also

) to the permittivity for frequencies in the visible range

The Lyddane–Sachs–Teller relation is named after the physicists R. H. Lyddane, Edward Teller, and R. G. Sachs.
