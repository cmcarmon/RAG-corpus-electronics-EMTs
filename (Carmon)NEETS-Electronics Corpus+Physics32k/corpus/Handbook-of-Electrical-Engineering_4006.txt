A different form of ﬁeld-effect transistor can be fabricated by inserting a highly doped, wider-bandgap semi-
conductor between the conducting channel and the gate electrode [Drummond et al., 1986]. The conducting
channel is then fabricated from undoped semiconductor. The discontinuity in energy bandgaps between the
two semiconductors, if properly designed, results in free charge transfer from the highly doped, wide-bandgap
semiconductor into the undoped, lower-bandgap channel semiconductor. The charge accumulates at the inter-
face and creates a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). The sheet charge is essentially two-dimensional and
allows  current  to  ﬂow  between  the  source  and  drain  electrodes.  The  amount  of  charge  in  the  2DEG  can  be
controlled by the potential applied to the gate electrode. In this manner the current ﬂow through the device
can be modulated by the gate and gain results. Since the charge ﬂows at the interface between the two materials,
but  is  conﬁned  in  the  undoped  channel  semiconductor,  very  little  impurity  scattering  occurs  and  extremely
high charge carrier mobility results. The device, therefore, has very high transconductance and is capable of
very high frequency operation and very low noise ﬁgure operation. This type of device is called a high electron
mobility  transistor  (HEMT).  HEMTs  can  be  fabricated  from  material  systems  such  as AlGaAs/GaAs  or AlI-
nAs/GaInAs/InP. The latter material system produces devices that have fT’s above 300 GHz and have produced
noise ﬁgures of about 1 dB at 100 GHz.
