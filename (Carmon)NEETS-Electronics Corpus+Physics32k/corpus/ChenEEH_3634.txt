These ﬁlters are very important building blocks for signal
processing systems implemented in discrete-time domain. In
particular, the widely available digital technology allows the
implementation of very fast and sophisticated ﬁlters in a cheap
and reliable manner. As a result, the digital ﬁlers are found in
numerous commercial products such as audio systems, bio-
medical equipment, digital radio, and TV just to mention a few.
