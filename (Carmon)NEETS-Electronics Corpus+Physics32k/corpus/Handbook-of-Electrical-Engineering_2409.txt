Non-ohmic Contacts
In general, high contact resistances are not a severe problem as long as enough current can be passed to get
measurable values of Vc and VH. The reason is that the voltage measurement contacts carry very little current.
However, in some cases, the contacts may set up a p/n junction and signiﬁcantly distort the current ﬂow. This
situation falls under the “inhomogeneity” category, discussed above. Usually, contacts this bad show variations
with current magnitude and polarity; thus, for the most reliable Hall measurements, it is a good idea to make
sure the values are invariant with respect to the magnitudes and polarities of both current and magnetic ﬁeld.
