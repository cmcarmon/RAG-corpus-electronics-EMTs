Despite the aforementioned advantages over SCMOS,
DCMOS is not widely used because of more serious problems,
namely higher power consumption, charge sharing, cascading,
and noninverting drawbacks. The higher power consumption
results from dynamic circuits requiring two phases of oper-
ation: precharging and evaluation. Due to the inherent struc-
ture of dynamic circuits, output nodes are precharged every
clock cycle, which results in a switching activity equivalent to
the system operating frequency. Since the power consumption
is proportional to switching activity, more dynamic and short
circuit power consumption are associated with DCMOS.
Charge sharing is the process by which the output node charge
