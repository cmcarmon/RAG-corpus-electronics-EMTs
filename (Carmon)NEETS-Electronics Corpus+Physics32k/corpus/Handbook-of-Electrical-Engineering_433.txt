From the networks point of view, the Maxwell k-tree approach not only enables one to express the solution
in  terms  of  the  topology  (namely  the  trees  and  2-trees  in  Example  3.7)  of  the  network  but  also  avoids  the
cancellation problem inherent in all the ï¬‚owgraph techniques since, as evident from Example 3.7, the trees and
