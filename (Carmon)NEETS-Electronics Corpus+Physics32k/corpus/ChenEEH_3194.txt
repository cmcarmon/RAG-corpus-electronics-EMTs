Presently, creepage attachments are made from an ethylene
vinyl acetate (EVA) polymer compound and are formulated for
properties desirable for outdoor insulation. These devices in-
crease the leakage distance, prevent cascading of rain, and can
also maintain a certain part of the insulator surface dry by the
umbrella effect. They could also be effective in reducing bird
excrement-related ﬂashover problems. Reports from ﬁeld ex-
perience suggest that they provide long-term improvement in
contamination performance. Adhesion of the creepage extender
to the porcelain surface is critical for satisfactory performance.
Some creepage extenders require the use of a heat source (ﬂame
torch) to ensure good bonding with the ceramic insulator
surface. Obviously, such systems should be installed off-line.
