The swashplate engine uses a swashplate in place of a crankshaft to translate the motion of a piston into rotary motion. Internal combustion engines and Stirling engines have been built using this mechanism. Duke Engines has been working on such a platform since 1993.
The axial piston pump drives a series of pistons aligned coaxially with a shaft through a swashplate to pump a fluid. A popular example of a swashplate application in a fluid pump is, in many cases, the compressor of a today's automobile air conditioning system. By varying the angle of the swashplate, the pistons' stroke and, therefore, the compressor's cooling capacity, can be dynamically adjusted.
A helicopter swashplate is a pair of plates, one rotating and one fixed, that are centered on the main rotor shaft. The rotating plate is linked to the rotor head, and the fixed plate is linked to the operator controls. Displacement of the alignment of the fixed plate is transferred to the rotating plate, where it becomes reciprocal motion of the rotor blade linkages. This type of pitch control, known as cyclic pitch, allows the helicopter rotor to provide selective lift in any direction.
Nutating flowmeters and pumps have similar motions to the wobble of a swashplate, but do not necessarily transform the motion to a reciprocating motion at any time.
Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars are flat plates that can scan up to sixty degrees in any direction from directly ahead of them. By mounting an AESA radar on a swashplate, the swashplate angle is added to the electronic scan angle. The typical swashplate angle chosen for this application is 40 degrees so the radar can scan a total angle of 200 degrees out of 360.
