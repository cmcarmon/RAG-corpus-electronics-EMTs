In infinitesimal small durations there is always one inertial frame, which momentarily has the same velocity as the accelerated body, and in which the Lorentz transformation hold. The corresponding three-acceleration

)



{\displaystyle \mathbf {a} ^{0}=\left(a_{x}^{0},\ a_{y}^{0},\ a_{z}^{0}\right)}
in these frames can be directly measured by an accelerometer, and is called proper acceleration or rest acceleration. The relation of





a

{\displaystyle \mathbf {a} ^{0}}
in a momentary inertial frame




S

{\displaystyle S'}
and




a



{\displaystyle \mathbf {a} }
measured in an external inertial frame



S


{\displaystyle S}
follows from (1c, 1d) with

{\displaystyle \mathbf {a} '=\mathbf {a} ^{0}}

u

{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} '=0}
,




u

=

v



{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} =\mathbf {v} }
and



γ
=

γ

v




{\displaystyle \gamma =\gamma _{v}}
. So in terms of (1c), when the velocity is directed in the x-direction by



u
=

u

x


=
v
=

v

x




{\displaystyle u=u_{x}=v=v_{x}}
and when only accelerations parallel (x-direction) or perpendicular (y-, z-direction) to the velocity are considered, it follows:

There is also a close relationship to the magnitude of four-acceleration: As it is invariant, it can be determined in the momentary inertial frame




S

{\displaystyle S'}
, in which





A

=


a

{\displaystyle \mathbf {A} _{r}^{\prime }=\mathbf {a} ^{0}}
and by

{\displaystyle d^{2}t'/d\tau ^{2}=A_{t}^{\prime }=0}

Thus the magnitude of four-acceleration corresponds to the magnitude of proper acceleration. By combining this with (3), an alternative method for the determination of the connection between





a

{\displaystyle \mathbf {a} ^{0}}
in




S

{\displaystyle S'}
and




a



{\displaystyle \mathbf {a} }
in

{\displaystyle |\mathbf {a} ^{0}|=|\mathbf {A} |={\sqrt {\gamma ^{4}\left[\mathbf {a} ^{2}+\gamma ^{2}\left({\frac {\mathbf {u} \cdot \mathbf {a} }{c}}\right)^{2}\right]}}}

from which (4a) follows again when the velocity is directed in the x-direction by



u
=

u

x




{\displaystyle u=u_{x}}
and only accelerations parallel (x-direction) or perpendicular (y-, z-direction) to the velocity are considered.
