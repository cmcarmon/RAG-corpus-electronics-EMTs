If one has access to mathematical analysis or hardware that predicts or approximates the performance of the
system, one should obviously compare the simulation and mathematical results. Unfortunately, in most cases
these results will not be available. Even though exact mathematical analysis of the system is not possible, it may
be  possible  to  develop  bounds  on  the  system  performance.  If  these  bounds  are  tight,  they  may  accurately
