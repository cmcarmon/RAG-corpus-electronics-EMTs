Rational functions occur most often in control as transfer
functions for single-input and single-output systems. Systems
with more than one input and more than one output can be
described by transfer function matrices. These matrices can be
realized as matrix polynomial fractions or as a polynomial
matrix ‘‘divided’’ by a polynomial. Much research has been
accomplished on this topic, particularly in its relationship to
multivariable system analysis and control. Inequalities involv-
ing polynomial matrices, ‘‘inverses,’’ and optimization prob-
lems are also becoming increasingly important.
