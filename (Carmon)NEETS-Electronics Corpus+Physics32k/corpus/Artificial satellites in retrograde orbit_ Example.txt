Israel has successfully launched seven Ofeq satellites in retrograde orbit aboard a Shavit launcher. These reconnaissance satellites complete one Earth orbit every 90 minutes and initially make about six daylight passes per day over Israel and the surrounding countries, though this optimal Sun-synchronized orbit degrades after several months. They were launched in retrograde orbit so that launch debris would land in the Mediterranean Sea, and not over populated neighboring countries on an eastward flight path.
The United States launched two Future Imagery Architecture (FIA) radar satellites into 122Â° inclined retrograde orbits in 2010 and 2012. The use of a retrograde orbit suggest that these satellites employ SAR techniques.
Earth-observing satellites may also be launched into a sun-synchronous orbit, which is slightly retrograde. This is typically done in order to keep a constant surface illumination angle, which is useful for observations in the visible or infrared spectrums. SEASAT and ERS-1 are examples of satellites launched into sun-synchronous orbits for this reason.
