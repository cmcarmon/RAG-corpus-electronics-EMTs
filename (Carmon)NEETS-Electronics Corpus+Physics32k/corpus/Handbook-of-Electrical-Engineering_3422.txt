  (DSP)  techniques  provide  another  type  of  A/D  conversion  ICs.  Specialized  A/D
sigma-delta modulation, speech sub-
conversion such as 
 can be accomplished through the use
band encoding, adaptive predictive speech encoding, 
of DSP systems. Some DSP systems require analog front ends that employ traditional PCM codec ICs or DSP
interface  ICs.  These  ICs  can  interface  to  a  digital  signal  processor  for  advanced  A/D  applications.  Some
manufacturers  have  incorporated  DSP  techniques  on  board  the  single-chip  A/D  IC,  as  in  the  case  of  the
DSP56ACD16 sigma-delta modulation IC by Motorola.
