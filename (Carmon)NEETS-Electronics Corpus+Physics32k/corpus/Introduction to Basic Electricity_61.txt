Like	resistance,	impedance	can	be	described	as	the	opposition	in	a	circuit;	unlike
resistance,	however,	it	refers	to	the	opposing	force	of	a	circuit	after	the	application
of	voltage.	It	is	only	relevant	to	AC	systems	or	circuits	where	direct	current	isn’t
the	supplied.
It	was	in	1893	when	the	concept	of	impedance	was	initially	introduced	by	the	Irish
engineer,	Arthur	Kenelly.	Back	then,	it	was	denoted	by	Z	and	is	defined	as	a
complex	number.
When	it	comes	to	quantitative	terms,	impedance	refers	to	the	ratio	of	voltage	to	the
electric	current	in	a	circuit.	Its	introduction	is	important	for	beginners	especially	if
they’re	scratching	their	heads	as	to	why	there’s	an	opposing	force	besides
resistance.
Impedance,	like	resistance,	comes	with	values.	In	a	single	open	circuit,	its	value	is
presented	in	ohms.	In	the	event	of	a	series	circuit	or	a	parallel	circuit,	its	value	can
be	calculated	by	simply	adding	all	the	defined	values	in	each	unit.
