Two single-phase 60-Hz sinusoidal-source generators (with negligible internal impedances) are
supplying to a common load of 10 kW at 0.8 power factor lagging. The impedance of the feeder
connecting the generator G1 to the load is 1.4 + j1.6 , whereas that of the feeder connecting
the generator G2 to the load is 0.8 + j1.0 . If the generator G1, operating at a terminal voltage
of 462 V (rms), supplies 5 kW at 0.8 power factor lagging, determine:
