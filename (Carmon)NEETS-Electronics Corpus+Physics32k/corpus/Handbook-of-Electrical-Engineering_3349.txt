Substrate materials for integrated optics include semiconductors, such as GaAs and InP, glass, polymer coated
glass or Si, and LiNbO3. Recently, primarily passive glass-based devices have been commercially introduced as
replacements  for  passive  all-Ô¨Åber  devices  such  as  splitters  and  combiners.  In  addition,  there  are  slow-speed
switches (millisecond) now available that utilize the thermooptic effect in glass. Glass-based devices are fabri-
cated by either depositing glass waveguiding layers on Si, or through the indiffusion of dopants into glass which
results in a waveguiding layer. Both fabrication approaches are used in commercially available devices.
