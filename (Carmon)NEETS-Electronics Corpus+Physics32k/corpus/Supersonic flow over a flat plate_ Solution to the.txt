This Fluid dynamics problem can be solved by different Numerical Methods. However, to solve it with Numerical Methods several assumptions have to be considered. And as a result shock layer properties and shock location is determined. Results vary with one or more than one of viscosity of the fluid, Mach number and angle of incidence changes. Generally for large angles of incidences, the variation of Reynoldâ€™s Number has significant effects on the change of the flow variables, whereas the viscous effects are dominant on the upper surface of the plate as well as behind the trailing edge of the plate.
Different experimenters get different result as per the assumptions they have made to solve the problem.
The primary method which is generally used to this problem:
