It has been recommended based on simulation studies in applications testing the validity of Taylor's law to a data sample that:
(1) the total number of organisms studied be > 15
(2) the minimum number of groups of organisms studied be > 5
(3) the density of the organisms should vary by at least 2 orders of magnitude within the sample
