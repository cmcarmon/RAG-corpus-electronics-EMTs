The motion of an object moving in a curved path is called curvilinear motion. Example: A stone thrown into the air at an angle.
Curvilinear motion describes the motion of a moving particle that conforms to a known or fixed curve. The study of such motion involves the use of two co-ordinate systems, the first being planar motion and the latter being cylindrical motion.
