The lumped circuit abstraction encounters other problems with time-
varying signals even when signal frequencies are small enough that propaga-
tion effects can be neglected. Let us revisit the circuit pictured in Figure 1.7 in
which a signal generator drives a resistor circuit. It turns out that under certain
conditions the frequency of the oscillator and the lengths and layout of the wires
may have a profound effect on the voltages. If the oscillator is generating a sine
wave at some low frequency, such as 256 Hz (Middle C in musical terms), then
the voltage divider relation developed in Chapter 2 (Equation 2.138) could be
used to calculate with some accuracy the voltage across R2. But if the frequency
of the sine wave were 100 MHz (1 Ã— 108 Hertz), then we have a problem. As
we will see later, capacitive and inductive effects in the resistors and the wires
(resulting from electric fields and magnetic fluxes generated by the signal) will
