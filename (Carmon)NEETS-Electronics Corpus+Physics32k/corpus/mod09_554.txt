At T1 the +25 volts already across the capacitor and the +25 volts from the input signal are in series 
and aid each other (SERIES AIDING). Thus, +50 volts appears across R1 and D1. At this time, the 
cathode of D1 is positive with respect to the anode, and the diode does not conduct. From T1 to T2, C1 
discharges to approximately +23 volts (because of the large values of R and C) and the output voltage 
drops from +50 volts to +48 volts.
