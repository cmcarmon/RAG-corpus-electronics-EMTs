Now look at figure 2-8. Here you see a diagram of a variable-mu, or remote-cutoff, tube. The only
difference between the remote-cutoff tube depicted and the sharp-cutoff tube is in the grid wire spacing.
In the conventional sharp-cutoff tube, the grid wires are evenly spaced, while in the remote-cutoff tube
the grid wires in the middle of the grid are placed relatively far apart. This is shown in view A.
