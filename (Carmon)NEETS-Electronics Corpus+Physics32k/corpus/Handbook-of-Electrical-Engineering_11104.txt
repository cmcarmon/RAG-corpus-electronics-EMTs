Mechanisms and Dosimetry
Although clinical effects of electric currents, PEMF, and sinusoidal electric and magnetic ﬁelds are well docu-
mented, and although some speciﬁc biochemical results have been obtained in vitro or in animal experiments
that  suggest  explanation  of  bone  and  soft  tissue  effects,  the  mechanism  of  ﬁeld-to-cell  or  ﬁeld-to-protein
transduction is presently not understood. As a consequence, optimum “dose” (what ﬁeld magnitude for how
long) and optimum waveshapes or frequencies for particular clinical applications are unknown, and dosimetry
relies largely on trial and error methods.
