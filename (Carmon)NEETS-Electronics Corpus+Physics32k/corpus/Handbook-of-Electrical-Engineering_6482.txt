To achieve these advantages, several limitations must be overcome. The conversion of current to light intensity
must be linear. Several nonlinear mechanisms must be avoided by proper laser design or by the use of various
linearization techniques. Also, because the photon energy is much larger than in microwave systems, the signal
Ô¨Ådelity is limited by quantum or
