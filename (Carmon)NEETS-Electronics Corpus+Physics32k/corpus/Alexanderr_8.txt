A complicated real circuit is displayed in Fig. 1.2, representing the
schematic diagram for a radio receiver. Although it seems complicated,
this circuit can be analyzed using the techniques we cover in this book.
Our  goal  in  this  text  is  to  learn  various  analytical  techniques  and
computer software applications for describing the behavior of a circuit
like this.
