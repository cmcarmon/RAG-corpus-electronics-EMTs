. Session identiﬁcation: In the best-effort Internet, every
ﬂow (or session) can be identiﬁed using the tuple <Src Ip,
Src Port, Dst IP, Dst Port, Protocol>. Thus, individual
transport layer sockets have to be established for every
session. If there ever arises a need to bunch sessions
together (for cutting costs), however, there is no available
mechanism. Hence, there is clearly a need to multiplex
different streams into the same transport layer socket.
This functionality is similar to that of the session layer
in the seven-layer OSI model, which has been notably
absent in TCP/IP protocol stack used in the Internet.
