Inductors are components designed to take advantage of this phenomenon by shaping the
length of conductive wire in the form of a coil. This shape creates a stronger magnetic ﬁeld
than what would be produced by a straight wire. Some inductors are formed with wire wound
in a self-supporting coil. Others wrap the wire around a solid core material of some type.
Sometimes the core of an inductor will be straight, and other times it will be joined in a loop
(square, rectangular, or circular) to fully contain the magnetic ﬂux. These design options all
have an effect on the performance and characteristics of inductors.
