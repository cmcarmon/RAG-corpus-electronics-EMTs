The base shown in figure 1-9 has two functions. First, it serves as the mounting for tube elements.
Second, it serves as the terminal points for the electrical connections to the tube elements. This is
accomplished by molding or otherwise bringing pins (or prongs) through the base. The internal ends of
these pins are connected to tube elements. The pins themselves are male connections.
