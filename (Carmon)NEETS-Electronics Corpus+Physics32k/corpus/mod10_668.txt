The use of parasitic elements and various stacking arrangements causes a reduction in the radiation 
resistance of a center-fed, half-wave antenna. Under these conditions obtaining a proper impedance match 
between the radiator and the transmission line is often difficult. A convenient method of overcoming 
these difficulties is to use a FOLDED DIPOLE in place of the center-fed radiator. (See views A and B of 
figure 4-20).
