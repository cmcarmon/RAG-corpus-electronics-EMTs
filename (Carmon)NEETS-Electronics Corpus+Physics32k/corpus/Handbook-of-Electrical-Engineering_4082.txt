Electromagnetic radiation is a form of energy at a particular frequency that can propagate through a medium.
This intentionally or unintentionally generated electromagnetic energy is considered as electromagnetic inter-
ference (EMI) if it degrades the performance of electronic systems. The purposeful generation of electromag-
netic  energy  for  communications  can  be  deÔ¨Åned  as  intentionally  generated  EMI;  unintentionally  generated
EMI can be created, for example, by the electrical signals in a computer and may be radiated into space by way
of the interconnecting cables and/or by openings in the device enclosures.
