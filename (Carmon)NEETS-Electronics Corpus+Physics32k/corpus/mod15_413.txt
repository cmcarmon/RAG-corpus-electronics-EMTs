A cylindrical frame with a standardized mounting flange houses the assembled resolver. External
and internal connections can be made to an insulated terminal board on the rear of the housing. Miniature
resolvers often have lead wires brought out through the rear of the resolver, eliminating the need for a
terminal block. A reference line is scribed on the face of the housing for alignment with a similar line on
the end of the rotor shaft. These are used in determining coarse electrical zero.
