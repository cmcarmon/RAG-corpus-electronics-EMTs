Employee workplace ethics cover a variety of 
 personal values, all of which an employer should be 
aware of. Some of the ethical issues that employers and 
employees alike should consider include these:
■● Behavior: Do not engage in abusive  behavior 
such as bullying other  employees,  displaying 
 pornography in their work space or on com-
puter screens, stealing from other employees 
or the  employer, or  telling  inappropriate or of-
fensive jokes, which is strictly forbidden in the 
workplace.
