SENSITIVITYÂ—(1) For an ammeter, the amount of current that will cause full-scale deflection of the 
meter. (2) For a voltmeter, the ratio of the voltmeter resistance divided by the full-scale reading of the 
meter; expressed in ohms per volt [3] [16]. (3) The ability of a receiver to reproduce very weak signals. 
The greater the receiver sensitivity, the weaker the signal that can be reproduced [17]. (4) Efficiency of 
a microphone. Describes microphone power delivered to a matched-impedance load as compared to the 
sound level being converted. Usually expressed in terms of the electrical power level [12].
