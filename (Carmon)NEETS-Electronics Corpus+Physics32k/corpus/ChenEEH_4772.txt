and a simpler design. We also provided design guidelines based
on L2 bounds on the transient, and we argued that this bound
makes it possible to precisely determine how large the compact
sets for the function approximators should be so that the states
do not exit them. Finally, we applied the direct adaptive
method to the problem of wing rock regulation, where the
wing rock dynamics are uncertain and where the angle of
attack is allowed to vary with time.
