Figure 27-1 shows the schematic symbol of a 
transformer.  The  direction  of  the  primary  and 
 secondary windings on the core determines the 
 polarity of the  induced voltage in the secondary 
winding. The AC voltage can either be in phase or 
180Â° out of phase with the induced voltage. Dots are 
used on the schematic symbol of the transformer to 
indicate polarity.
