TPV systems are now commercially available operating at power levels in the range of several tens of watts
to about 500 W. Market analyses indicate that TPV may be competitive for a variety of distributed generation
applications of up to about 100 kW. In addition, many industrial processes operate in a range of temperatures
suitable for TPV conversion. As the technology matures, these may provide the opportunity for co-generation
of  heat,  as  well  as  electricity.  In  this  type  of  application,  TPV  units  of  several  megawatt  electric  generating
capacity  would  be  reached  to  correspond  with  the  scale  of  the  waste  heat  from  associated  manufacturing
processes.
