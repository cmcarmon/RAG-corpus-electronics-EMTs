Unlike the pn-junction diode, the point-contact diode depends on the pressure of contact between a 
point and a semiconductor crystal for its operation. Figure 2-51A and B, illustrate a point-contact diode. 
One section of the diode consists of a small rectangular crystal of n-type silicon. A fine berylium-copper, 
bronze-phosphor, or tungsten wire called the CATWHISKER presses against the crystal and forms the 
other part of the diode. During the manufacture of the point contact diode, a relatively large current is 
passed from the catwhisker to the silicon crystal. The result of this large current is the formation of a 
small region of p-type material around the crystal in the vicinity of the point contact. Thus, a pn-junction 
is formed which behaves in the same way as a normal pn-junction.
