A different approach is taken in some testability analysis tools whereby rather than determining which faults
are  covered  by  a  given  test  pattern,  the  analysis  program  assigns  a  numeric  value  to  indicate  the  degree  of
difﬁculty of controlling and observing the digital circuit’s nodes. This analysis, which can be done much more
quickly  compared  to  performing  fault  simulation,  should  be  done  prior  to  attempting  to  generate  the  test
patterns for a circuit so that time will not be spent unnecessarily on digital circuits which are likely to present
difﬁculties for the ATPG/fault-simulation process to deal with.
