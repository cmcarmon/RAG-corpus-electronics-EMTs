The LAN Service Model
Within  the  scope  of  the  well-known  Open  Systems  Interconnection  seven-layer  reference  model,  the  LAN
occupies the two bottom layers, namely, the physical and data link layers, as shown in Fig. 72.10. The physical
layer speciﬁes the most primitive services of the LAN, e.g., media characteristics, signal formats, waveforms,
signaling rates, timing, and mechanical aspects of connectors, etc. The data link layer uses the services of the
physical layer to provide multiple access for stations sharing the media. Station or network management, which
is shown as a vertical “layer” in Fig. 72.10, is responsible for maintaining a necessary level of performance, fault
detection and recovery, and conﬁguration and security functions.
