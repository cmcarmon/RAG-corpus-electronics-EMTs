DC Motor Characteristics
We gain an understanding of the speed–torque characteristics of a dc motor from Equations
(13.4.2) through (13.4.4). In shunt motors, the ﬁeld current can be simply controlled by the
use of a variable resistance in series with the ﬁeld winding; the load current inﬂuences the
ﬂux only through armature reaction, and its effect is therefore relatively small. In series mo-
tors, the ﬂux is largely determined by the armature current, which is also the ﬁeld current;
it is somewhat difﬁcult to control the armature and ﬁeld currents independently. In the com-
pound motor, the effect of the armature current on the ﬂux depends on the degree of com-
pounding. Most motors are designed to develop a given horsepower at a speciﬁed speed,
and it follows from Equations (13.4.2) and (13.4.3) that the angular velocity ωm can be ex-
pressed as
