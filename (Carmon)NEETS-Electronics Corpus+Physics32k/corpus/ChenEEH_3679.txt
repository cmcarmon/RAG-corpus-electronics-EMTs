Let us summarize these important results. Ignoring the
technicalities of
z-transform existence, we assume that
the output (pressure wave) of the speech production system
is the result of ﬁltering the appropriate excitation by two
(in the unvoiced case) or three (voiced) linear, separable
ﬁlters. Ignoring the developments above momentarily,
let
us suppose that we know ‘‘exact’’ or ‘‘true’’
linear models
of the various components. By this we mean that we (some-
how) know models that will exactly produce the speech
waveform under consideration. These models are only
constrained to be linear and stable and are otherwise unre-
stricted. In the unvoiced case S(z) ¼ E(z)T (z)R(z), where E(z)
represents a partial realization of a white noise process. In the
voiced case, S(z) ¼ E(z)G(z)T (z)R(z), where E(z) represents
a DT impulse train of period P, the pitch period of the
utterance. Accordingly, the true overall system function is as
follows:
