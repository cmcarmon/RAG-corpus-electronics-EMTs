. Armature windings: The windings on the stator are
referred to as the armature windings. The armature is
the source from which the power generated will be
drawn. A voltage is induced in the armature from the
rotation of the ﬁeld generated by currents on the rotor.
For purposes of modeling, the self-inductance, including
leakage, and mutual inductance between phases of the
armature windings describe the circuit performance as
current ﬂows from the terminals. The armature windings
