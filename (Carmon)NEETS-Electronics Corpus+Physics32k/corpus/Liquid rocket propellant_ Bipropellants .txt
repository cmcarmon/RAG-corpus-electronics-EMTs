Definitions of some of the mixtures:
IRFNA IIIa
83.4% HNO3, 14% NO2, 2% H2O, 0.6% HF
IRFNA IV HDA
54.3% HNO3, 44% NO2, 1% H2O, 0.7% HF
RP-1
See MIL-P-25576C, basically kerosene (approximately C10H18)
MMH monomethylhydrazine
CH3NHNH2
Has not all data for CO/O2, purposed for NASA for Martian-based rockets, only a specific impulse about 250 s.
r
Mixture ratio: mass oxidizer / mass fuel
Ve
Average exhaust velocity, m/s. The same measure as specific impulse in different units, numerically equal to specific impulse in N·s/kg.
C*
Characteristic velocity, m/s. Equal to chamber pressure multiplied by throat area, divided by mass flow rate. Used to check experimental rocket's combustion efficiency.
Tc
Chamber temperature, °C
d
Bulk density of fuel and oxidizer, g/cm³
