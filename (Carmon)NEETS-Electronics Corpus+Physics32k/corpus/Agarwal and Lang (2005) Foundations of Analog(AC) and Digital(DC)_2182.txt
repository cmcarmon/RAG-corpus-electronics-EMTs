Shown in Figure 15.31 is another Op Amp circuit that uses positive feedback.
Assume that the power supply voltages are VS and −VS. This circuit behaves
as an oscillator, and uses positive feedback to saturate the Op Amp at both
positive and negative values of VS. Let’s examine how this oscillator works.
