Induction
The essentials for producing an emf by magnetic means are electric and magnetic circuits, mutually
interlinked. Figure 12.1.2(a) shows a load (or sink or motor) convention with the induced emf
(or back emf) e directed in opposition to the positive current, in which case Faradayâ€™s law of
