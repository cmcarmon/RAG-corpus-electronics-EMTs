Why Spread Spectrum?
Spread spectrum is a communication technique wherein the transmitted modulation is spread (increased) in
bandwidth prior to transmission over the channel and then despread (decreased) in bandwidth by the same
amount at the receiver. If it were not for the fact that the communication channel introduces some form of
narrowband (relative to the spread bandwidth) interference, the receiver performance would be transparent to
the  spreading  and  despreading  operations  (assuming  that  they  are  identical  inverses  of  each  other).  That  is,
after despreading the received signal would be identical to the transmitted signal prior to spreading. In the
presence  of  narrowband  interference,  however,  there  is  a  signiÔ¨Åcant  advantage  to  employing  the  spread-
ing/despreading procedure described. The reason for this is as follows. Since the interference is introduced after
the  transmitted  signal  is  spread,  then,  whereas  the  despreading  operation  at  the  receiver  shrinks  the  desired
signal back to its original bandwidth, at the same time it spreads the undesired signal (interference) in bandwidth
by the same amount, thus reducing its power spectral density. This, in turn, serves to diminish the effect of
the interference on the receiver performance, which depends on the amount of interference power in the spread
bandwidth. It is indeed this very simple explanation, which is at the heart of all spread spectrum techniques.
