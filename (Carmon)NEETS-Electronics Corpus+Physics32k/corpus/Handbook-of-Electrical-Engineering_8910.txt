Main memory, or backing store, consists of banks of dense semiconductor memory. Since each memory chip
has a small off-chip bandwidth, rows of these chips are placed together to form a bank, and multiple banks are
used to increase the total bandwidth from main memory. When a bank is accessed, it remains busy for a period
of time, during which the processor may make no other accesses to that bank. By increasing the number of
interleaved (parallel) banks, the chance that the processor issues two conï¬‚icting requests to the same bank is
reduced.
