For  a  detailed  discussion  of  the  physics  of  these  junction  types,  see  [Fonash,  1981;  Green,  1982;  and  Hovel,
1976]. The junction is designed to maximize the voltage at any current; accordingly the objective is to minimize
J0. The pn junction leads to the minimum values for I0, in part due to the lack of interface states and the ability
to tune the doping. Other junction types can approximate, but usually fall short of the values achieved by the
pn junction.
