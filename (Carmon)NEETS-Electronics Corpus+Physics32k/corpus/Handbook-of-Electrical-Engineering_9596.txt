In practice, however, it is not always true that every bit or bit pair that is being processed would be productive.
Some of the bits produce only repetitious (superﬂuous) or even meaningless results. This happens more often
and more severely in a parallel processor than in a word-sequential processor. Consider, for example, performing
 operands, it
a maximum search operation in a mesh-connected parallel processor (such as ILLIAC IV). For

comparisons in word-sequential machines. Thus, in effect there are
