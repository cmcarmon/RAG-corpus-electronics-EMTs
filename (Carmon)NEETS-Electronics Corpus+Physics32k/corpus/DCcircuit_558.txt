Furthermore, the ”loop” we trace for KVL doesn’t even have to be a real current path in the
closed-circuit sense of the word. All we have to do to comply with KVL is to begin and end at
the same point in the circuit, tallying voltage drops and polarities as we go between the next
and the last point. Consider this absurd example, tracing ”loop” 2-3-6-3-2 in the same parallel
resistor circuit:
