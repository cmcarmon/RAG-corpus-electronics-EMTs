In the octal example 78 cannot be subtracted from 68, so you must borrow from the 4. Reduce the 4
by 1 and add 108 (the borrow) to the 68 in the minuend. By subtracting 78 from 168, you get a difference of
78. Write this number in the difference line and bring down the 3. You may need to refer to table 1-4, the
octal addition table, until you are familiar with octal numbers. To use the table for subtraction, follow
these directions. Locate the subtrahend in column Y. Now find where this line intersects with the minuend
in area Z. The remainder, or difference, will be in row X directly above this point.
