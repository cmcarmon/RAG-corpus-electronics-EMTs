You have seen that the source voltage in a series circuit divides proportionately across each resistor
in the circuit. IN A PARALLEL CIRCUIT, THE SAME VOLTAGE IS PRESENT IN EACH BRANCH.
(A branch is a section of a circuit that has a complete path for current.) In figure 3-37 this voltage is equal
to the applied voltage (Es). This can be expressed in equation form as:
