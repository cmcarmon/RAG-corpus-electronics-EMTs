In quantum mechanics, angular momentum is quantized – that is, it cannot vary continuously, but only in "quantum leaps" between certain allowed values. For any system, the following restrictions on measurement results apply, where



ℏ


{\displaystyle \hbar }
is the reduced Planck constant and






n
^





{\displaystyle {\hat {n}}}
is any direction vector such as x, y, or z:

(There are additional restrictions as well, see angular momentum operator for details.)
The reduced Planck constant



ℏ


{\displaystyle \hbar }
is tiny by everyday standards, about 10−34 J s, and therefore this quantization does not noticeably affect the angular momentum of macroscopic objects. However, it is very important in the microscopic world. For example, the structure of electron shells and subshells in chemistry is significantly affected by the quantization of angular momentum.
Quantization of angular momentum was first postulated by Niels Bohr in his Bohr model of the atom and was later predicted by Erwin Schrödinger in his Schrödinger equation.
