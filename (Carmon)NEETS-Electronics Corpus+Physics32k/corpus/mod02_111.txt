 In addition to copper loss, an iron-core coil (inductor) has two iron losses. These are called 
HYSTERESIS LOSS and EDDY-CURRENT LOSS. Hysteresis loss is due to power that is consumed in 
reversing the magnetic field of the inductor core each time the direction of current in the inductor 
changes.
