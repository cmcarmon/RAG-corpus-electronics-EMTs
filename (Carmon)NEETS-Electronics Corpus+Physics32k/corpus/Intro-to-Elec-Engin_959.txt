11.5.5 Three single-phase 100-kVA, 2400:240-V, 60-Hz
transformers (each of which has an equivalent se-
ries impedance of 0.045+ j0.16  referred to its
low-voltage side) are connected to form a three-
phase, 4160:240-V transformer bank, which in
turn is connected to a three-phase feeder with
an impedance of 0.5 + j1.5 /phase. When the
three-phase transformer bank delivers 250 kW at
240 V and 0.866 lagging power factor, determine:
(a) The transformer winding currents.
(b) The sending-end voltage (line to line) at the
