resonance  that  arises  from  a  displacement  and  vibration  of  atoms  relative  to  each  other,  while  an  electronic
resonance  absorption  effect  occurs  over  the  ultraviolet  frequencies  as  a  consequence  of  the  electrons  being
forced to execute vibrations at the frequency of the external Ô¨Åeld.
