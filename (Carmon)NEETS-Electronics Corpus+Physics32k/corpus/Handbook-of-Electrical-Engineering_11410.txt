The American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine publishes monthly the Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine,
which contains largely clinically oriented articles, and many clinically oriented ultrasound texts are available
covering almost any medical discipline. However, there are only a few books that provide more than a cursory
treatment of the basic physics and instrumentation of ultrasound imaging.
