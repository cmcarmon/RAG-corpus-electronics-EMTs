The ratio of visual output power to aural output power can vary from one installation to another; however,
the aural is typically operated at between 10 and 20% of the visual power. This difference is the result of the
reception characteristics of the two signals. Much greater signal strength is required at the consumer’s receiver
to recover the visual portion of the transmission than the aural portion. The aural power output is intended
to be sufﬁcient for good reception at the fringe of the station’s coverage area but not beyond. It is of no use
for a consumer to be able to receive a TV station’s audio signal but not the video.
