The free-fall time is a very useful estimate of the relevant timescale for a number of astrophysical processes. To get a sense of its application, we may write

.


{\displaystyle t_{\text{ff}}\simeq {\frac {35\,{\mbox{min}}}{\sqrt {\rho }}}\cdot {\sqrt {\frac {\mbox{g}}{{\mbox{cm}}^{3}}}}.}

Here we have estimated the numerical value for the free-fall time as roughly 35 minutes for a body of mean density 1 g/cm3.
