The average electron tube is a rugged device capable of withstanding the shocks and knocks of
everyday usage and handling. However, they are not indestructible. You should remember that most
electron tubes contain a near vacuum enclosed by a glass envelope. Because of this, the glass is under
constant stress from atmospheric pressure. Any undue stress, such as striking the envelope against a hard
surface, may cause the envelope to shatter, resulting in an IMPLOSION.
