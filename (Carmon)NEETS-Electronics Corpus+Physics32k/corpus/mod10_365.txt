In the discussion of attenuation, fog may be considered as another form of rain. Since fog remains 
suspended in the atmosphere, the attenuation is determined by the quantity of water per unit volume and 
by the size of the droplets. Attenuation because of fog is of minor importance at frequencies lower than 2 
gigahertz. However, fog can cause serious attenuation by absorption, at frequencies above 2 gigahertz.
