Another special optoelectronic device in common use today is the photodiode. Unlike the LED, 
which produces light, the photodiode uses light to accomplish special circuit functions. Basically, the 
PHOTODIODE is a light-controlled variable resistor. In total darkness, it has a relatively high resistance 
and therefore conducts little current. However, when the PN junction is exposed to an external light 
source, internal resistance decreases and current flow increases. The photodiode is operated with 
reverse-bias and conducts current in direct proportion to the intensity of the light source.
