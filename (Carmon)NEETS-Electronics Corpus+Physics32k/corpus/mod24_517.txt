The near-field power distribution is defined as the emitted power per unit area (radiance) for each
position in the plane of the emitting surface. For this chapter, the emitting surface is the output area of a
fiber-end face. Near-field power distributions describe the emitted power per unit area in the near-field
region. The near-field region is the region close to the fiber-end face. In the near-field region, the distance
between the fiber-end face and detector is in the micrometers ( m m) range.
