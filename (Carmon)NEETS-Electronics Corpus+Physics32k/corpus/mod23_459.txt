The write/read electronics consists of the write part and the read part. The write part takes incoming 
data from the interface electronics, formats it as needed, and writes it onto the disk. The read part reads 
the data off of the disk, formats it as needed, and sends it to the interface electronics for output to the host 
computer. The write/read electronics also performs the initial disk formatting function.
