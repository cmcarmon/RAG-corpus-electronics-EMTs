Aperture blockage and spillover are two main problems of
multiple reﬂectors. An obstacle, such as a feed or feed support,
in front of a reﬂector is called aperture blockage. Aperture
blockage degrades the antenna performance by lowering the
gain, increasing the side lobes, and ﬁlling in the nulls. If the
feed beamwidth is excessive and illuminates over the reﬂector
aperture, it is called spillover. Spillover will cause an undesired
antenna response in the direction of the spillover.
