We first examine the circuit with the difference-mode part of the input only. Refer to
Figure 8.30 for the circuit and its small-signal model. Assume that the two MOSFETâ€™s
have identical characteristics, gm1 = gm2 = gm. An application of KCL at the source
node of the two MOSFETs (in other words, the node with the small-signal voltage vs)
yields
