where v1 is the voltage between the inverting terminal and ground and
v2 is  the  voltage  between  the  noninverting  terminal  and  ground.  The
op amp senses the difference between the two inputs, multiplies it by
the  gain  A,  and  causes  the  resulting  voltage  to  appear  at  the  output.
Thus, the output vo is given by
