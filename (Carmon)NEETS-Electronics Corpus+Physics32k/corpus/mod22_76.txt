The computers of the second generation (1959-1963), were characterized by transistors (fig. 1-7) 
instead of vacuum tubes. Transistors were smaller, less expensive, generated almost no heat, and required 
very little power. Thus second generation computers were smaller, required less power, and produced a 
lot less heat. The use of small, long lasting transistors also increased processing speeds and reliability. 
Cost performance also improved. The storage capacity was greatly increased with the introduction of 
magnetic disk storage and the use of magnetic cores for main storage. High speed card readers, printers,
