The drift of electrons is slow (approximately an 
eighth of an inch per second), but individual elec-
trons ricochet off atoms, knocking other electrons 
loose, at the speed of light (186,000 miles per second). 
For  example, visualize a long, hollow tube filled with 
Ping-Pong balls (Figure 11-4). As a ball is added to 
one end of the tube, a ball is forced out the other end 
of the tube. Although an individual ball takes time to 
travel down the tube, the speed of its impact can be far 
greater.
