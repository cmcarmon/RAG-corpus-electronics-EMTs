Klystrons are velocity-modulated tubes that are used in radar and communications equipment as 
oscillators and amplifiers. Klystrons make use of the transit-time effect by varying the velocity of an 
electron beam in much the same manner as the previously discussed velocity-modulation process. Strong 
electrostatic fields are necessary in the klystron for efficient operation. This is necessary because the 
interaction of the signal and the electron beam takes place in a very short distance.
