UNIX began life as a minicomputer time-sharing system, but
is now used on machines ranging from notebook computers to
supercomputers. It offers three interfaces: the shell, the system
call library, and the system calls themselves. The shell allows
users to type commands for execution. These may be simple
commands or more complex shell scripts. Standard input and
output may be redirected.
