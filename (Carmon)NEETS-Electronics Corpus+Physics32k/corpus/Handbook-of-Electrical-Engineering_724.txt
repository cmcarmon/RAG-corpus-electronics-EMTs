Stability
An important concern in circuit theory is whether the output signal remains bounded or increases indeÔ¨Ånitely
following the application of an input signal. An unbounded output could damage or even destroy the circuit,
and thus it is important to know before applying the input if the circuit can accommodate the expected output.
This question can be answered by determining the stability of the circuit.
