(ii) Sending-end voltage ¯ES.
(iii) Sending-end power PS.
(iv) Receiving-end current ¯IR.
(v) Receiving-end voltage ¯ER.
(vi) Receiving-end power PR.
(vii) Power loss in dB, which is given by 10
(c) Find the wavelength (λ = 2π/β) of the signal
on the line in part (b) and the length of the
line in terms of wavelengths. Also, ﬁnd the
transmission loss in nepers and decibels of the
transmission line in part (b). (1 neper = 8.686
dB.)
(d) For a lossless line (with R = G = 0) in which
√
the velocity of energy propagation is given by
vp = ω/β = 1/
LC, ﬁnd expressions for
α and β. Consider the line in part (b) to be
lossless, and calculate the corresponding α,
β, and vp.
