Systems  generally  require  a  greater  number  of  memory  locations  than  are  available  in  the  main  memory
(i.e., a larger address space). The entire address space that the CPU uses is kept on large magnetic or optical
disks; this is called the virtual address space, or virtual memory. The most frequently used sections of the virtual
memory are kept in main memory (physical memory), and are moved back and forth in units called pages.
The  place  at  which  a  virtual  address  lies  in  main  memory  is  called  its  physical  address.  Since  a  much  larger
address space (virtual memory) is mapped onto a much smaller one (physical memory), the CPU must translate
the memory addresses issued by a program (virtual addresses) into their corresponding locations in physical
memory (physical addresses). This mapping is maintained in a memory structure called the page table. When
the CPU attempts to access a virtual address that does not have a corresponding entry in physical memory, a
page fault occurs. Since a page fault requires an access to a slow mechanical storage device (such as a disk), the
CPU usually switches to a different task while the needed page is read from the disk.
