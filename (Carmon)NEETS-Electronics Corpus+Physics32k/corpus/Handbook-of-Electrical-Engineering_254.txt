Steinmetz [Smith and Dorf, 1992] found a way to exploit complex algebra to create an elegant framework
for representing signals and analyzing circuits when they are in the steady state. In this approach, a model is
developed in which each physical sign is replaced by a “complex” mathematical signal. This complex signal in
polar, or exponential, form is represented as
