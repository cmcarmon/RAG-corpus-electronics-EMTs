are in the opposite direction. Thus, the magnetic ﬁeld of the armature currents is stationary in
space in spite of the rotation of the armature.
The process of reversal of currents in the coil is known as commutation. The current changes
from +I to −I in time t. Ideally, the current in the coils being commutated should reverse
linearly with time, as shown in Figure 13.4.4. Serious departure from linear commutation results
in sparking at the brushes. Means for achieving sparkless commutation are touched upon later.
As shown in Figure 13.4.4, with linear commutation, the waveform of the current in any coil as
a function of time is trapezoidal.
