Speed limits in India vary by state and vehicle type. Lower limits than the ones specified can be set by local governments. All speed limits are in km/h.
In 2007, a law was proposed to set a nationwide 100 km/h speed limit for cars and 65 km/h for motorcycles, but this was not implemented.
It is common to see speeds of 100â€“120 km/h on expressways, of which there are very few in India, the most notable being the Mumbai-Pune Expressway. Motorcycles are not allowed to use expressways. The speed limit on the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, Delhi-Agra Highway, Delhi- Jaipur Highway, Delhi-Chandigarh Highway is 80 km/h. Bangalore's Airport expressway, opened in 2008, has a design speed of 180 km/h.
Speed-limit enforcement in India is almost non-existent, although recently highway police have begun to use automated instruments which capture the speed and mail the fine to the car's owner. Failure to pay may result in doubling of the fine, cancellation of the driving license and even arrest. Police are now also using wireless PDAs to identify a driver's or vehicle's history. 85th percentile speed is adopted for safe speed limit at zone. 98th is for highway geometric design. 15th percentile speed is used as minimum speed on major highways.
The recently constructed Outer Ring Road in Hyderabad is designed for speeds up to 120 km/h. It is also one of the very few roads to have a minimum speed limit.
