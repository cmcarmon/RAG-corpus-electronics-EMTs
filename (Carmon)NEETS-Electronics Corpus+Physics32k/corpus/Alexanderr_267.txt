5.10.2 Instrumentation Ampliﬁers
One  of  the  most  useful  and  versatile  op  amp  circuits  for  precision
measurement and process control is the instrumentation ampliﬁer (IA),
so called because of its widespread use in measurement systems. Typ-
ical  applications  of  IAs  include  isolation  ampliﬁers,  thermocouple
ampliﬁers, and data acquisition systems.
