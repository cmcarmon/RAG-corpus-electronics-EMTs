LBM is usually estimated using mathematical formulas.
The following formula may be used:
For men: LBM = (0.32810 × W) + (0.33929 × H) − 29.5336
For women: LBM = (0.29569 × W) + (0.41813 × H) − 43.2933
where W is body weight in kilograms and H is body height in centimeters.
A nomogram based on height, weight and arm circumference may be used.
