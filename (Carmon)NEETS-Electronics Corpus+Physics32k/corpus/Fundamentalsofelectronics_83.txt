2.6.5 Derivative Systems and Integrators
Systems that perform calculus-like operations on their inputs can produce waveforms signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
than present in the input. Derivative systems operate in a straightforward way: A ﬁrst-derivative system
dt x (t). Integral systems have the complication that the
would have the input-output relationship y (t) = d
