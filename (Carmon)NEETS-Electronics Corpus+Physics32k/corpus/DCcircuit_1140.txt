these zones only in a limited range of energies depending on the particular zone and how oc-
cupied that zone is with other electrons. If electrons really did act like tiny planets held in
orbit around the nucleus by electrostatic attraction, their actions described by the same laws
describing the motions of real planets, there could be no real distinction between conductors
and insulators, and chemical bonds between atoms would not exist in the way they do now. It
is the discrete, ”quantitized” nature of electron energy and placement described by quantum
physics that gives these phenomena their regularity.
