Most digital multimeters limit current measure-
ments to less than one amp. The typical digital 
multimeter has a maximum range of 200 milli-
amperes. Attempting to measure substantially 
higher currents may cause the fuse in the meter 
to blow. Many analog meters, especially older 
ones, support current readings of 5 or 10 amps, 
maximum.
You may find analog meters that can tolerate 
a  high‐ampere  input  handy  if  you’re  testing 
motors and circuits that draw a lot of current. 
If you have only a digital meter with a limited‐
milliampere input, you can still measure higher 
currents indirectly by using a low‐resistance, 
high‐wattage  resistor.  To  do  this,  you  place 
a 1 Ω, 10‐watt resistor in series with your cir-
cuit so that the current you want to measure 
passes through this test resistor. Then you use 
your multimeter as a voltmeter, measuring the
