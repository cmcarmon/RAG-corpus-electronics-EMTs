crystals are materials that can convert  mechanical 
energy to electrical energy when pressure is  applied 
or  can  convert  electrical  energy  to   mechanical 
 energy  when  a  voltage  is  applied.  When  an  AC 
 voltage is  applied to a crystal, the crystal stretches 
and compresses, creating mechanical vibrations that 
 correspond to the frequency of the AC signal.
