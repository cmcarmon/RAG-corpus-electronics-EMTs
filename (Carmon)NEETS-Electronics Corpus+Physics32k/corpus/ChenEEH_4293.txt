. A proxy server is responsible for routing and delivering
messages to the called party. It receives requests and for-
wards them to another server (called a next-hop server),
which may be another proxy server, a UAS, or a redirect
server. It can fork a request, sending copies to multiple
next-hop servers at once. This allows a call setup request to
try many different locations at once. It can also forward the
invitation to a multicast group. A proxy server can be call-
stateful, stateful (transaction-stateful), or stateless.
