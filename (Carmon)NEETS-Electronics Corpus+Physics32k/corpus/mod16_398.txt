Good-quality, portable wattmeters usually have an accuracy of 0.2 to 0.25 percent. You must
remember, though, that electrodynamic wattmeter errors increase with frequency. For the higher
frequency and power ranges, special types of wattmeters are made specifically for those ranges. We will
discuss two such wattmeters in chapter 5 of this module.
