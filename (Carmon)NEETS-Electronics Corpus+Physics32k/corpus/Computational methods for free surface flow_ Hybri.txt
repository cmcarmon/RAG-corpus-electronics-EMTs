There are some fluid flows which do not come under either of the category, for example, bubbly flows. For the computation of such two-phase flows which do not come under any of the above discussed categories, elements are borrowed from both surface-capturing and surface-tracking methods. Such methods are called hybrid methods. In this method, fluid properties are smeared over a fixed number of grid points normal to the interface. Now, as in interface capturing method, both fluids are treated as single fluid with variable properties. Interface is also tracked as in interface-tracking method to prevent it from smearing by moving the marker particles using the velocity field generated by the flow solver. marker particles are added and removed to maintain the accuracy by keeping the approximate spacing between them equal.
