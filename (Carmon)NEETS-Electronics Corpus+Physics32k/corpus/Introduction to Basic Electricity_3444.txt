thin-film	integrated	circuits are formed on the 
surface of an insulating substrate of glass or ceramic, 
usually less than an inch square. The components (re-
sistors and capacitors) are formed by an extremely thin 
film of metal and oxides deposited on the substrate. 
Thin strips of metal are then deposited to connect the 
components. Diodes and transistors are formed as 
separate semiconductor devices and attached in the 
proper location. Resistors are formed by depositing 
tantalum or nichrome on the surface of the substrate 
in a thin film 0.0001 inch thick. The value of the resis-
tor is determined by the length, width, and thickness 
of each strip. Conductors are formed of low-resistance 
metal such as gold, platinum, or aluminum. This pro-
cess can produce a resistor accurate to within + 0.1%. 
It can also obtain a ratio between resistors accurate to 
+0.01%. Accurate ratios are important for the proper 
operation of a particular circuit.
