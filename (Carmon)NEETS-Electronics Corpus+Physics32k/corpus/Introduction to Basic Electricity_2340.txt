A capacitor is either fixed or variable. A fixed	
	capacitor has a definite value that cannot be changed. 
A variable	 capacitor is one whose  capacitance 
can be changed either by varying the space  between 
plates (trimmer capacitor) or by varying the amount 
of  meshing  between  two  sets  of  plates  (tuning 
capacitor).
