The negative sign near the battery symbol indicates the negative terminal 
of the battery, to which the current flows after it makes its way around the 
circuit. The arrow in the circuit indicates the reference direction of current 
flow, and because it’s pointing away from the positive terminal of the battery 
in a DC circuit, you should expect the value of the current to be positive all 
the time.
