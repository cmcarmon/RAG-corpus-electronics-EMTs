The E and H fields that are set up in the transfer of energy through space are known collectively as 
the radiation field. This radiation field is responsible for electromagnetic radiation from the antenna. The 
radiation field decreases as the distance from the antenna is increased. Because the decrease is linear, the 
radiation field reaches great distances from the antenna.
