Einstein's theory of General Relativity amounts to a description of the relationship between the curvature of space-time, on the one hand, and the distribution of matter throughout space-time on the other. This precise details of this relationship are determined by the Einstein equations

is a constant.) The Einstein equations express local relationships between the quantities involved—specifically, this is a system of coupled non-linear second order partial differential equations.
A very simple observation can be made at this point: the zero-point of energy-momentum is not arbitrary. Adding a "constant" to the right-hand side of the Einstein equations will effect a change in the Einstein tensor, and thus also in the curvature properties of space-time.
All known classical matter fields obey certain "energy conditions". The most famous classical energy condition is the "weak energy condition"; this asserts that the local energy density, as measured by an observer moving along a time-like world line, is non-negative. The weak energy condition is essential for many of the most important and powerful results of classical relativity theory—in particular, the singularity theorems of Hawking et al.
