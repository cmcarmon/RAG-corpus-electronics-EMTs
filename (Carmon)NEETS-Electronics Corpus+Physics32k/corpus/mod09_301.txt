When power is applied to the circuit, oscillations are started by any random noise (random electrical 
variations generated internally in electronic components). A change in the flow of base current results in 
an amplified change in collector current which is phase-shifted the 180 degrees. When the signal is 
returned to the base, it has been shifted 180 degrees by the action of the RC network, making the circuit 
regenerative.  View (A) of figure 2-18 shows the amount of phase shift produced by C1 and R1. View (B) 
shows the amount of phase shift produced by C2 and R2 (signal received from C1 and R1), and view (C) 
shows the complete phase shift as the signal leaves the RC network. With the correct amount of resistance 
and capacitance in the phase-shifting network, the 180-degree phase shift occurs at only one frequency. 
At any other than the desired frequency, the capacitive reactance increases or decreases and causes an 
incorrect phase relationship (the feedback becomes degenerative). Thus, the oscillator works at only one 
frequency. To find the resonant frequency (fr) of an RC phase shift oscillator, use the following formula:
