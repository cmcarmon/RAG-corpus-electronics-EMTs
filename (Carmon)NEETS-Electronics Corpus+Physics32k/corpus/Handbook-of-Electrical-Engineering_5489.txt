Equal Pulse Spacing Control
A control system based on the principle of equal spacing of Ô¨Åring pulses at intervals of 60 degrees (electrical)
independent of ac bus voltages was developed in the late 1960s. The basic components of this system, shown
in Fig. 61.17, consist of a voltage-controlled oscillator and ring counter. The frequency of the oscillator is directly
proportional to the dc control voltage Vc. Under steady-state conditions, pulse frequency is precisely 6f, where
f is the ac system frequency. The phase of each grid pulse will have some arbitrary value relative to the ac bus
voltage. If the three-phase ac bus voltages are symmetrical sine waves with no distortion, then a is the same
for all valves. The oscillator will be phase-locked with the ac system frequency to avoid drifting. The dc control
voltage Vc is derived from a feedback loop for constant current, constant power, or constant extinction angle g.
The control systems used in recent projects are digital-based and much more sophisticated than the earlier
