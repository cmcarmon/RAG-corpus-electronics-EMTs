Manufacturers  supply  integrated  circuit  (IC)  packages  containing  several  bistable  devices.  One  data  book
for the transistor-transistor logic (TTL) circuit technology lists 4-, 8-, 9-, and 10-bit latches in one IC package.
The same data book lists 2-, 4-, 6-, 8-, 9-, and 10-bit ﬂip-ﬂops in one IC package. While a 1-bit bistable can
only  store  1  bit  of  information,  8-bit  bistables  are  capable  of  storing  8  bits  of  information.  Bistable  devices
implemented  with  logic  gates  are  volatile  devices.  When  power  is  ﬁrst  applied  the  ﬁrst  stored  value  of  the
bistable is random (it can store a 1 or a 0), and when power is removed the bistable loses its storage capability.
Certain memories (also called stores) are nonvolatile and therefore retain their data when power is removed.
These devices will not be discussed in this section.
