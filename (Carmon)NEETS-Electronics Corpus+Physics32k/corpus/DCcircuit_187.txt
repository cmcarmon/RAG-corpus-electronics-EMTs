Ohm’s Law is not very useful for analyzing the behavior of components like these where re-
sistance varies with voltage and current. Some have even suggested that ”Ohm’s Law” should
be demoted from the status of a ”Law” because it is not universal. It might be more accurate
to call the equation (R=E/I) a deﬁnition of resistance, beﬁtting of a certain class of materials
under a narrow range of conditions.
