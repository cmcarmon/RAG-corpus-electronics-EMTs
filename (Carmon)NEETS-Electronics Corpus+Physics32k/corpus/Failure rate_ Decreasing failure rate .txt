A decreasing failure rate (DFR) describes a phenomenon where the probability of an event in a fixed time interval in the future decreases over time. A decreasing failure rate can describe a period of "infant mortality" where earlier failures are eliminated or corrected and corresponds to the situation where Î»(t) is a decreasing function.
Mixtures of DFR variables are DFR. Mixtures of exponentially distributed random variables are hyperexponentially distributed.
