resistance offered by the meter would impede the electron ﬂow and alter the circuits operation.
Thus, the multimeter is designed to have practically zero ohms of resistance between the test
probe tips when the red probe has been plugged into the red ”A” (current-measuring) socket. In
the voltage-measuring mode (red lead plugged into the red ”V” socket), there are many mega-
ohms of resistance between the test probe tips, because voltmeters are designed to have close
to inﬁnite resistance (so that they don’t draw any appreciable current from the circuit under
test).
