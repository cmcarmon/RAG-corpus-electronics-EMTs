. Block-oriented timing analysis
generates design input (also called primary input) to design output (also called primary output), and propa-
gation  delays  by  analyzing  the  design  “stage-by-stage”  and  by  summing  up  the  individual  stage  delays.  All
devices  driven  by  primary  inputs  constitute  stage  1,  all  devices  driven  by  the  outputs  of  stage  1  constitute
stage 2, and so on. Starting with the ﬁrst stage, all devices associated with a stage are annotated with worst-
case delays. A worst-case delay is the propagation delay of the device plus the delay of the last input to arrive
at the device, i.e., the signal path with the longest delay leading up to the device inputs. For example, the device
labeled  “H”  in  stage  3  in  Fig. 34.12  is  annotated  with  the  worst-case  delay  of  13,  representing  the  device
propagation delay of 4 and the delay of the last input to arrive through devices “B” and “C” of 9 [McWilliams
and  Widdoes,  1978].  When  the  devices  associated  with  the  last  stage,  i.e.,  the  devices  driving  the  primary
outputs,  are  processed,  the  accumulated  worst-case  delays  record  the  longest  delay  from  primary  inputs  to
primary outputs, also call the critical paths. The critical path for each primary output is highlighted in Fig. 34.12.
Path-oriented timing analysis generates primary input to primary output propagation delays by traversing
all  possible  signal  paths  one  at  a  time.  Thus,  ﬁnding  the  critical  path  via  path-oriented  timing  analysis  is
equivalent to ﬁnding the longest path through a directed acyclic graph, where devices are graph vertices and
interconnections are graph edges [Sasiki et al., 1978].
