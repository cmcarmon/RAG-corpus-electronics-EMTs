This excitation voltage can be produced by the generator itself or it can be supplied by an outside 
source, such as a battery. A generator that supplies its own field excitation is called a SELF-EXCITED 
GENERATOR. Self-excitation is possible only if the field pole pieces have retained a slight amount of 
permanent magnetism, called RESIDUAL MAGNETISM. When the generator starts rotating, the weak 
residual magnetism causes a small voltage to be generated in the armature. This small voltage applied to
