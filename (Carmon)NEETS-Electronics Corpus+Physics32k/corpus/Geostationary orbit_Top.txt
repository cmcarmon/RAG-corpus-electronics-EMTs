A geostationary orbit, geostationary Earth orbit (often loosely referred to as geosynchronous equatorial orbit) (GEO) is a circular geosynchronous orbit 35,786 kilometres (22,236 mi) above the Earth's equator and following the direction of the Earth's rotation. An object in such an orbit appears motionless, at a fixed position in the sky, to ground observers. Communications satellites and weather satellites are often placed in geostationary orbits, so that the satellite antennas (located on Earth) that communicate with them do not have to rotate to track them, but can be pointed permanently at the position in the sky where the satellites are located. Using this characteristic, ocean color satellites with visible and near-infrared light sensors (e.g. the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI)) can also be operated in geostationary orbit in order to monitor sensitive changes of ocean environments.
A geostationary orbit is a particular type of geosynchronous orbit, which is an orbit which has an orbital period equal to the Earth's rotational period (one sidereal day) and thus the distinction being that while an object in geosynchronous orbit returns to the same point in the sky at the same time each day, an object in geostationary orbit never leaves that position. Geosynchronous orbits move around relative to a point on the earth's surface, because while geostationary orbits have an inclination of 0 degrees relative to the equator, geosynchronous orbits have varying inclinations and eccentricities.
