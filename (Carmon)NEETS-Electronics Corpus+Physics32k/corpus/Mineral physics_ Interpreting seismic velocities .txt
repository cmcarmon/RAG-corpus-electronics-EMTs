Inversion of seismic data give profiles of seismic velocity as a function of depth. These must still be interpreted in terms of the properties of the minerals. A very useful heuristic was discovered by Francis Birch: plotting data for a large number of rocks, he found a linear relation of the compressional wave velocity




v

p




{\displaystyle v_{p}}
of rocks and minerals of a constant average atomic weight





M

{\displaystyle {\overline {M}}}
with density



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }

.
This relationship became known as Birch's law. This makes it possible to extrapolate known velocities for minerals at the surface to predict velocities deeper in the Earth.
