Further,  because  CDMA  systems  tend  to  be  interference  limited,  for  those  applications  involving  voice
transmission,  an  additional  gain  in  the  capacity  of  the  system  can  be  achieved  by  the  use  of  voice  activity
detection. That is, in any given two-way telephone conversation, each user is typically talking only about 50%
of  the  time.  During  the  time  when  a  user  is  quiet,  he  is  not  contributing  to  the  instantaneous  interference.
Thus, if a sufÔ¨Åciently large number of users can be supported by the system, statistically only about one-half
of them will be active simultaneously, and the effective capacity can be doubled.
