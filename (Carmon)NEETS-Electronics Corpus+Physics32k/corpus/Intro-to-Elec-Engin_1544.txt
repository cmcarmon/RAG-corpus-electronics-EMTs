15.1.21 Consider a transmission system as shown in Figure
P15.1.21. Taking G1 as large as possible, ﬁnd the
needed gains G1 and G2.
15.1.22 In the transmission system of Figure 15.1.4, let G1
= 23 dB; α1 = α2 = 2.5 dB/km, l1 + l2 = 30 km,
Pin = 1 mW; and Pout = 50 mW. Determine l1, l2,
G2, and G3 such that the signal power equals 20
µW at the input to G2 and G3.
