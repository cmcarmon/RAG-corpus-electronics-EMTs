integrating (dual-slope) analog-to-digital converters which give good noise rejection over integer numbers 
of line cycles. Faster sampling rates for ATE are achieved using successive-approximation or other 
techniques. User may have to perform averaging as a post-processing step in order to achieve acceptable 
signal-to-noise ratios.
Allow sufÔ¨Åcient time for transients to settle for both stimulus/response instruments and device under test.
Automatic measurements can produce large arrays of data at high speeds. Actual throughput to a hard disk 
may be much less than the maximum sampling rate of a data acquisition element (plug-in board, external 
instrument).
Choices between free-running, external, and internal.
