With the presence of sine and cosine functions, it is clear that the nat-
ural  response  for  this  case  is  exponentially  damped  and  oscillatory  in
nature.  The  response  has  a  time  constant  of 
and  a  period  of
T ⫽ 2p兾␻d.
Figure  8.9(c)  depicts  a  typical  underdamped  response.
[Figure 8.9 assumes for each case that
