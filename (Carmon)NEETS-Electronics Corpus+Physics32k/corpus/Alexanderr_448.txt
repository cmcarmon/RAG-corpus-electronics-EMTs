The  usefulness  of  the  duality  principle  is  self-evident.  Once  we
know  the  solution  to  one  circuit,  we  automatically  have  the  solution
for the dual circuit. It is obvious that the circuits in Figs. 8.8 and 8.13
are  dual.  Consequently,  the  result  in  Eq.  (8.32)  is  the  dual  of  that  in
Eq. (8.11). We  must  keep  in  mind  that  the  method  described  here  for
Ô¨Ånding  a  dual  is  limited  to  planar  circuits.  Finding  a  dual  for  a  non-
planar  circuit  is  beyond  the  scope  of  this  textbook  because  nonplanar
circuits cannot be described by a system of mesh equations.
