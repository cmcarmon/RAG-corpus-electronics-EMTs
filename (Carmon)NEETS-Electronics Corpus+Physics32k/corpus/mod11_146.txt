output lead is usually a probe or loop extending into one of the tuned cavities and coupled into a 
waveguide or coaxial line. The plate structure, shown in figure 2-18, is a solid block of copper. The 
cylindrical holes around its circumference are resonant cavities. A narrow slot runs from each cavity into 
the central portion of the tube dividing the inner structure into as many segments as there are cavities. 
Alternate segments are strapped together to put the cavities in parallel with regard to the output. The 
cavities control the output frequency. The straps are circular, metal bands that are placed across the top of 
the block at the entrance slots to the cavities. Since the cathode must operate at high power, it must be 
fairly large and must also be able to withstand high operating temperatures. It must also have good 
emission characteristics, particularly under return bombardment by the electrons. This is because most of 
the output power is provided by the large number of electrons that are emitted when high-velocity 
electrons return to strike the cathode. The cathode is indirectly heated and is constructed of a high-
emission material. The open space between the plate and the cathode is called the INTERACTION 
SPACE. In this space the electric and magnetic fields interact to exert force upon the electrons.
