The  life  of  a  transformer  insulation  system  depends,  to  a  large  extent,  upon  its  temperature.  The  total
temperature  is  the  sum  of  the  ambient  and  the  temperature  rise.  The  temperature  rise  in  a  transformer  is
intrinsic  to  that  transformer  at  a  ﬁxed  load.  The  ambient  temperature  is  controlled  by  the  environment  the
transformer is subjected to. The better the cooling system that is provided for the transformer, the higher the
“kVA” rating for the same ambient. For example, the kVA rating for a transformer can be increased with forced
air (fan) cooling. Forced oil and water cooling systems are also used. Also, the duration of operating time at
high temperature directly affects insulation life.
