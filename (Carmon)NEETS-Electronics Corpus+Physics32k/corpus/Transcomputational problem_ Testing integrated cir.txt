Exhaustively testing all combinations of an integrated circuit with 309 inputs and 1 output requires testing of a total of 2309 combinations of inputs. Since the number 2309 is a transcomputational number (that is, a number greater than 1093), the problem of testing such a system of integrated circuits is a transcomputational problem. This means that there is no way one can verify the correctness of the circuit for all combinations of inputs through brute force alone.
