Bug	fixing	–	if	there	are	critical	faults	in	a	circuit’s	design,	it	can	be
recognized	better	with	a	closer	look	at	each	of	its	components;	instead	of
resorting	to	assumptions,	a	circuit	creator	can	identify	which	part	of	his
project	needs	modification
Advanced	technical	information	–	advanced	technical	information	is
rewarded	when	opening	up	a	circuit;	especially	for	beginners,	reverse
engineering	is	a	practical	way	of	learning	about	the	straightforward	details
within	the	system
Incorporation	of	a	new	functionality	–	reverse	engineering	can	allow	the
incorporation	of	a	feature	in	a	circuit;	rather	than	design	another	circuit,	a
circuit	creator	can	simply	make	modifications	on	his	current	project
Modernization	–	reversing	is	beneficial	in	circuitry	since	it	can	be	used	to
modernize	a	project;	for	instance,	if	most	modern	devices	are	popular	in	the
market	due	to	an	innovative	feature,	a	circuit	creator	can	employ	reverse
engineering	to	add	the	same	feature	to	his	circuit
Guarantee	product	security	–	if	a	circuit	creator	is	unsure	of	the	security	of
his	project,	reverse	engineering	is	a	way	for	him	to	determine	certain
concerns;	he	can	check	the	specifications	of	each	component	and	guarantee
that	none	poses	safety	risks	when	put	to	use
