When a megger is used, the generator voltage is present on the test leads. This voltage could be
hazardous to you or to the equipment you are checking. Therefore, NEVER TOUCH THE TEST
LEADS WHILE THE MEGGER IS BEING USED and isolate the item you are checking from the
equipment before using the megger.
