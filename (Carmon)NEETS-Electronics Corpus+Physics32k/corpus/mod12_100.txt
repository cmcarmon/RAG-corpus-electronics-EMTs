The principles of this circuit are similar to those of the block diagram circuit of figure 1-16. Notice in 
figure 1-19 that the two generators are connected in series. Therefore, the resultant waveform of their 
combined frequencies will determine when the cathode of D1 will be negative with respect to the anode, 
thereby controlling the conduction of the diode. The new frequencies that are generated by applying these 
signals to nonlinear impedance D1 are the sum and difference of the two original frequencies. The 
frequency-selective device T1 may be tuned to whichever frequency is desired for use in later circuit 
stages. Heterodyning action takes place, intentionally or not, whenever these conditions exist. 
Heterodyning (MIXING) circuits are found in most electronic transmitters and receivers. These 
transmitter and receiver circuits will be explained in detail later in this module.
