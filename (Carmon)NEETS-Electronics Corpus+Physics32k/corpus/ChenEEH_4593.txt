In the online situation, the number of input output data
for the training process becomes a very important design
parameter. The system dynamics may keep changing because
of different fault situations (i.e., the incipient fault, abrupt
fault, and multiple faults). Apparently, using all input/output
measurements to train the online estimator does not make
too much sense since it is possible to use invalid training
patterns to mislead the estimator, and it is also unrealistic for
online applications. In other words, only ﬁnite and limited
number of data sets should be used as training patterns to
adjust the parameters of the estimator. A reasonable way is to
use the most recent input/output measurements. A set, B, that
contains the most recent measurements in a ﬁxed length of a
