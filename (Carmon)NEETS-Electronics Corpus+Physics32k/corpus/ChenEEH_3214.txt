The electrical and physical arrangements of the switching
and bussing at the subtransmission voltage level are deter-
mined by the selected substation scheme (or diagram). On
the other hand, the selection of a particular substation scheme
is based on safety, reliability, economy, simplicity, and other
considerations. The most commonly used substation bus
schemes include (1) single bus scheme, (2) double bus–double
breaker (or double main) scheme, (3) main-and-transfer bus
scheme, (4) double bus–single breaker scheme, (5) ring bus
scheme, and (6) breaker-and-a-half scheme. Figure 6.2 shows
various bus schemes.
Each scheme has
