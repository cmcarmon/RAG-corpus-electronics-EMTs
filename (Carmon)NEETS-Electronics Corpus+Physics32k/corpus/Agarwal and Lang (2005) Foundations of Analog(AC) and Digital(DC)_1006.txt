There are several factors that can govern our choice of the operating point.
For example, the operating point dictates the maximum dynamic range of the
input signal for both positive and negative excursions for which the MOSFET
operates in saturation. As can be seen from Equation 7.15, the operating point
value of the input voltage also governs the signal gain of the amplifier. This
section will focus on selecting an operating point based on maximizing the
useful input signal range. We will have more to say about the relationship
between the gain of the amplifier and its operating point in Section 8.2.3 in
Chapter 8.
