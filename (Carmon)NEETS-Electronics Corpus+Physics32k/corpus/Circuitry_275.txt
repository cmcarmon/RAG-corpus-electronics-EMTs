Integrated circuits 
 
Integrated  circuits  are  complex  circuits  fabricated 
on a small slice of silicon. Integrated circuits may 
contain  as  few  as  10  or  more  than  100,000  active 
devices (transistors and diodes). With the exception 
(such  as 
of  a 
amplification  at  high-power 
integrated 
circuits  have  largely  rendered  a  great  deal  of 
conventional discrete circuitry obsolete.  
Integrated  circuits  can  be  divided  into  two 
 
general  classes, 
linear  (analogue)  and  digital. 
Typical  examples  of  linear  integrated  circuits  are 
operational  amplifiers  (see  Chapter  8)  whereas 
typical  examples  of  digital  integrated  are  logic 
gates (see Chapter 9).  
  A number of devices bridge the gap between the 
analogue  and  digital  world.  Such  devices  include 
analogue  to  digital  converters  (ADC),  digital  to 
analogue  converters  (DAC),  and 
timers.  For 
example,  the  ubiquitous  555  timer  contains  two 
operational amplifier stages (configured as voltage 
comparators) together with a digital bistable stage, 
a buffer amplifier and an open-collector transistor.
