In classical mechanics, the Euler force is the fictitious tangential force that is felt in reaction to any angular acceleration. That reactive acceleration is the Euler acceleration (named for Leonhard Euler), also known as azimuthal acceleration or transverse acceleration. It is an acceleration that appears when a non-uniformly rotating reference frame is used for analysis of motion and there is variation in the angular velocity of the reference frame's axes. This article is restricted to a reference frame that rotates about a fixed axis.
The Euler force is related to the Euler acceleration by F = ma, where a is the Euler acceleration and m is the mass of the body.
