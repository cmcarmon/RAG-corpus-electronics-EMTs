The Maximum Power Transfer Theorem is not: Maximum power transfer does not
coincide with maximum efﬁciency. Application of The Maximum Power Transfer theorem to
AC power distribution will not result in maximum or even high efﬁciency. The goal of high ef-
ﬁciency is more important for AC power distribution, which dictates a relatively low generator
impedance compared to load impedance.
