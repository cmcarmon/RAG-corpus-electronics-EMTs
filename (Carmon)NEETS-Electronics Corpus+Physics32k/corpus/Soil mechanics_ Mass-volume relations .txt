There are a variety of parameters used to describe the relative proportions of air, water and solid in a soil. This section defines these parameters and some of their interrelationships. The basic notation is as follows:





V

a




{\displaystyle V_{a}}
,




V

w




{\displaystyle V_{w}}
, and




V

s




{\displaystyle V_{s}}
represent the volumes of air, water and solids in a soil mixture;





W

a




{\displaystyle W_{a}}
,




W

w




{\displaystyle W_{w}}
, and




W

s




{\displaystyle W_{s}}
represent the weights of air, water and solids in a soil mixture;





M

a




{\displaystyle M_{a}}
,




M

w




{\displaystyle M_{w}}
, and




M

s




{\displaystyle M_{s}}
represent the masses of air, water and solids in a soil mixture;





ρ

a




{\displaystyle \rho _{a}}
,




ρ

w




{\displaystyle \rho _{w}}
, and




ρ

s




{\displaystyle \rho _{s}}
represent the densities of the constituents (air, water and solids) in a soil mixture;
Note that the weights, W, can be obtained by multiplying the mass, M, by the acceleration due to gravity, g; e.g.,




W

s


=

M

g


{\displaystyle W_{s}=M_{s}g}

Specific Gravity is the ratio of the density of one material compared to the density of pure water (

{\displaystyle \rho _{w}=1g/cm^{3}}
).

{\displaystyle G_{s}={\frac {\rho _{s}}{\rho _{w}}}}

Note that specific weight, conventionally denoted by the symbol



γ


{\displaystyle \gamma }
may be obtained by multiplying the density (



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
) of a material by the acceleration due to gravity,



g


{\displaystyle g}
.
Density, Bulk Density, or Wet Density,



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
, are different names for the density of the mixture, i.e., the total mass of air, water, solids divided by the total volume of air water and solids (the mass of air is assumed to be zero for practical purposes):

{\displaystyle \rho '=\rho \ -\rho _{w}}

where




ρ

{\displaystyle \rho _{w}}
is the density of water
Water Content,



w


{\displaystyle w}
is the ratio of mass of water to mass of solid. It is easily measured by weighing a sample of the soil, drying it out in an oven and re-weighing. Standard procedures are described by ASTM.
