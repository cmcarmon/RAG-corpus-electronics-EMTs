The Planck force is also associated with the equivalence of gravitational potential energy and electromagnetic energy and in this context it can be understood as the force that confines a self-gravitating mass to half its Schwarzschild radius:

{\displaystyle F_{\text{P}}={\frac {Gm^{2}}{r_{\text{G}}^{2}}}}

{\displaystyle r_{\text{G}}={\frac {r_{\text{s}}}{2}}={\frac {Gm}{c^{2}}}.}
,
where G is the gravitational constant, c is the speed of light, m is any mass and rG is half the Schwarzschild radius, rs, of the given mass. Since the dimension of force is also a ratio of energy per length, the Planck force can be calculated as energy divided by half the Schwarzschild radius:

{\displaystyle F_{\text{P}}={\frac {mc^{2}}{\frac {Gm}{c^{2}}}}={\frac {c^{4}}{G}}.}

As mentioned above, Planck force has a unique association with the Planck mass. The gravitational attractive force of two bodies of 1 Planck mass each, set apart by 1 Planck length is 1 Planck force. This unique association also manifests itself when force is calculated as any energy divided by the reduced Compton wavelength (reduced by 2π) of that same energy:

{\displaystyle F={\frac {mc^{2}}{\frac {\hbar }{mc}}}={\frac {m^{2}c^{3}}{\hbar }}.}

Here the force is different for every mass (for the electron, for example, the force is responsible for the Schwinger effect; see page 3 here [1]). It is Planck force only for the Planck mass (approximately 2.18 × 10−8 kg). This follows from the fact that the Planck length is a reduced Compton wavelength equal to half the Schwarzschild radius of the Planck mass:

{\displaystyle {\frac {\hbar }{m_{\text{P}}c}}={\frac {Gm_{\text{P}}}{c^{2}}}}

which in turn follows from another relation of fundamental significance:
