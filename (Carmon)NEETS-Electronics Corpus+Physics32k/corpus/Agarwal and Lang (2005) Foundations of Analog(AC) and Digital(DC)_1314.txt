To analyze its operation with a source that takes a discontinuous
step, we refer to Equation 9.64, and notice that we must contend with the
differentiation of the step at t = 0. We can develop an understanding of this
differentiation with the help of the ramping unit step function u(t; T ) defined
in Figure 9.41. Here, u(t; T ) is a function of time t, having the ramp duration T
as a parameter.
Note that the ramp in u(t; T ), which occurs over the period 0 ≤ t ≤ T,
becomes increasingly steeper as the ramp width T approaches 0. In fact, it is
u(t; T ) in the limit T → 0, or simply u(t), as illustrated in Figure 9.42. Notice
that the ideal unit step is the function at work in Equation 9.79. Recognizing this
limiting behavior, our approach to dealing with the differentiation of a step will
be to take a more roundabout, but easier route: We will compute the response
of the circuit to a ramping unit step function, and then take the limit as T → 0.
