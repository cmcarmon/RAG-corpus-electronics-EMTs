• Continuous-data and discrete-data systems. A continuous-data system is one in which
the signals at various parts of the system are all functions of the continuous-time variable
t. When one refers to an ac control system, it usually means that the signals in the system
are modulated by some kind of modulation scheme. On the other hand, a dc control system
implies that the signals are unmodulated, but they are still ac signals according to the
conventional deﬁnition. Typical components of a dc control system are potentiometers,
dc ampliﬁers, dc motors, and dc tachometers; typical components of an ac control system
are synchros, ac ampliﬁers, ac motors, gyroscopes, and accelerometers.
