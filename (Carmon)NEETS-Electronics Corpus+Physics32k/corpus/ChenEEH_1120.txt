Optical MEMS switches for ﬁber communications systems
have been developed and tested by a wide variety of small and
large companies. Their testing data, however, is not available,
and such switches have not yet found widespread use in actual
systems. In a similar fashion, MEMS switches for radio-
frequency (RF) and microwave systems have been widely de-
veloped and tested. Some company test data are available, even
though the RF MEMS switches have yet to ﬁnd their way into
large numbers of commercial products. Raytheon has reported
testing capacitive-style stitches to over 108 cycles. Motorola
tested metal-to-metal RF switches to over 4  109 cycles.
Such reliability is adequate for some applications of RF
MEMS switches but not for the most demanding defense
applications. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
currently has a development program underway to produce
MEMS switches for RF systems that will work for 1012 cycles.
The already large and fast-growing database on MEMS reli-
ability, both during pre-use laboratory tests and during ﬁeld
use, indicates that sophisticated MEMS devices can be very
reliable. This high reliability derives from the same wafer
production technologies that make microelectronics reliable
as well as relatively cheap. The general situation on MEMS
reliability can be summarized along the lines of the different
kinds of MEMS. Those devices that are micromachined but do
not have moving parts (like nozzles and microchannels) and
those devices that actually move but do not touch (like pres-
sure and acceleration sensors) are highly reliable. Even some
MEMS components, notably the DMD, that involve internal
contact for many cycles can be very reliable. Only in the most
demanding situations, namely actual contact for about a tril-
lion cycles, do MEMS remain to be proven as reliable.
