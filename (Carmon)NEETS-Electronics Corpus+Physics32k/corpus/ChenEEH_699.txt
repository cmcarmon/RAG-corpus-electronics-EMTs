Data-Flow and Loop Transformations
In a ﬁrst step, the code has to be transformed to expose
maximal locality and potential data reuse. This is done by
globally applying data-ﬂow and loop transformations. Loop
transformations are well known and include loop interchange,
merging, folding, and skewing. Data-ﬂow transformations are
less known and include, for example, algebraic law exploi-
tation, recomputation (in terms of data transfer and storage,
which can be beneﬁcial to recompute certain data whenever
they are needed instead of storing them in memory), and
bottleneck removal (of which an illustration is shown in
section 2.4.2). We will now give a simple example of apply-
ing loop transformations
for data transfer and storage
optimization.
