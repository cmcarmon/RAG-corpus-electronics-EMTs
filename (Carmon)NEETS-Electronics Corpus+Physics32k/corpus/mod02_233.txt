CAPACITORâ€”A capacitor is a physical device consisting of two pieces of conducting material
separated by an insulating material. This insulating material is referred to as the DIELECTRIC. Because the
dielectric is an insulator, NO current flows through the capacitor. If the dielectric breaks down and becomes
a conductor, the capacitor can no longer hold a charge and is useless. The ability of a dielectric to hold a
charge without breaking down is referred to as the dielectric strength. The measure of the ability of the
dielectric material to store energy is called the dielectric constant. The dielectric constant is a relative value
based on 1.0 for a vacuum.
