Inﬁnite Impulse Response Filter Design
An  inﬁnite  impulse  response  (IIR)  digital  ﬁlter requires  less  computation  to  implement  than  a  FIR  digital
ﬁlter with a corresponding frequency response. However, IIR ﬁlters cannot generally achieve a perfect linear-
phase response and are more susceptible to ﬁnite wordlength effects.
