Here, τ is the delay. The way to understand this system is to focus on the time origin: The output at time
t = τ equals the input at time t = 0. Thus, if the delay is positive, the output emerges later than the input,
and plotting the output amounts to shifting the input plot to the right. The delay can be negative, in which
case we say the system advances its input. Such systems are diﬃcult to build (they would have to produce
signal values derived from what the input will be), but we will have occasion to advance signals in time.
2.6.4 Time Reversal
With a time-reversal system, the output signal equals the input signal ﬂipped about the vertical axis (the
time origin).
