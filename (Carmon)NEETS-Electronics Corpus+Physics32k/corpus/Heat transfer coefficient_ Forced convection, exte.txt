In analyzing the heat transfer associated with the flow past the exterior surface of a solid, the situation is complicated by phenomena such as boundary layer separation. Various authors have correlated charts and graphs for different geometries and flow conditions. For flow parallel to a plane surface, where



x


{\displaystyle x}
is the distance from the edge and



L


{\displaystyle L}
is the height of the boundary layer, a mean Nusselt number can be calculated using the Colburn analogy.
