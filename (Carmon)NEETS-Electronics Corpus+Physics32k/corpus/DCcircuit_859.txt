A current source generates as much or as little voltage as needed across its leads to produce
a constant amount of current through it. This is just the opposite of a voltage source (an ideal
battery), which will output as much or as little current as demanded by the external circuit in
maintaining its output voltage constant. Following the ”conventional ﬂow” symbology typical
of electronic devices, the arrow points against the direction of electron motion. Apologies for
this confusing notation: another legacy of Benjamin Franklin’s false assumption of electron
ﬂow!
