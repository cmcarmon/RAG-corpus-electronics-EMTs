Signaling is also a critical element of the physical layer. Baseband modulation, in which digital signals (0s
and 1s) are transmitted as electrical or optical pulses, is common in LANs because of its simplicity. Modulation
of carriers is less common but especially important when several independent channels are employed. Amplitude,
