Although electromagnetic radiation from transmission lines and antennas is usually of insufficient 
strength to electrocute personnel, it can lead to other accidents and compound injuries. Voltages may be 
induced in ungrounded metal objects, such as wire guys, wire cable (hawser), hand rails, or ladders. If you 
come in contact with these objects, you could receive a shock or rf burn. This shock can cause you to 
jump or fall into nearby mechanical equipment or, when working aloft, to fall from an elevated work area. 
Take care to ensure that all transmission lines or antennas are deenergized before working near or on 
them.
