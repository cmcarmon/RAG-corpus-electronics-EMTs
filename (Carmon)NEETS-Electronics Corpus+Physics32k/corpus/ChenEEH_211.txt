Nonlinear resistors have a common characteristic that their
constitutive relationships are described by nonlinear algebraic
equations. Dynamical nonlinear elements, such as nonlinear
inductors and capacitors, are described by nonlinear dif-
ferential equations. The constitutive relation of a nonlinear
capacitor is:
