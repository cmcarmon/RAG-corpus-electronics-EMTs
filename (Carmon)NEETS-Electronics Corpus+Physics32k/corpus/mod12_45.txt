The basic alternating waveform for all complex waveforms is the sine wave. Therefore, an 
understanding of sine wave characteristics and how they can be acted upon is essential for you to 
understand modulation. You may want to review sine waves in chapter 1 of NEETS, Module 2, 
Introduction to Alternating Current and Transformers at this point.
