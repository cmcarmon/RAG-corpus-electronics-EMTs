The RE102 encompasses electric ﬁeld limits as shown in Figure 40.16 a, b, and c. The frequency bands of
the testing requirements typically cover from 10 kHz to 18 GHz depending on the clock frequency of the device
or  types  of  platforms  which  is  described  in  Table  40.7.  Up  to  30  MHz,  only  the  vertical  polarization  of  the
electric ﬁeld will be measured and compared with the limits. Above 30 MHz, both horizontal and vertical ﬁeld
components  must  be  measured  and  again  compared  with  the  limits.  The  device  is  in  conformance  with  the
RE102 if the electric ﬁeld intensity in the appropriated frequency band is less than the prescribed limit.
