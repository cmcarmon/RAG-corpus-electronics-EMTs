produces  two  clear  peaks  with  the  Cadzow  estimate  also  providing  a  hint  of  a  third  sinusoidal  peak. When
signal restoration is applied to the original block Toeplitz-Hankel data matrix (14.134), the enhanced Cadzow
estimate also shown in Fig. 14.20 arises. This enhanced estimate clearly identiÔ¨Åes the three sinusoids and their
corresponding frequency estimates in an accurate fashion. The advantages accrued through signal restoration
are made evident by this example.
