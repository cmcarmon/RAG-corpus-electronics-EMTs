Until 1935, all magnetic recording was on steel wire. Then, at the 1935 German Annual Radio
Exposition in Berlin, Fritz Pfleumer demonstrated his Magnetophone. It used a cellulose acetate tape
coated with soft iron powder. The Magnetophone and its "paper" tapes were used until 1947 when the 3M
Company introduced the first plastic-based magnetic tape.
