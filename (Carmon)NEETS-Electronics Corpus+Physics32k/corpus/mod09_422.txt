When S1 is closed in the series RL circuit (view (B) of figure 3-31) L acts as an open at the first 
instant as source voltage appears across it. As current begins to flow, EL decreases and ER and I increase, 
all at exponential rates. Figure 3-32, view (A), shows these exponential curves. In a time equal to 5 time 
constants the resistor voltage and current are maximum and EL is zero. This relationship is shown in the 
following formula:
