conclusions of the rule (the then portion) as true. A forward-
chaining reasoning system starts by placing initial data in its
working memory. Then the system goes through a cycle of
matching the premises of rules with the facts in the working
memory, selecting one rule, and placing its conclusion in the
working memory. This inference process is useful in searching
for a goal or an interpretation, given a set of data. For example,
XCON is a forward-chaining rule-based system (McDermott,
1982) that contains several thousand rules for designing con-
ﬁgurations of computer components for individual customers.
It was one of the ﬁrst clear commercial successes of expert
systems. Its underlying technology has been implemented in
the general-purpose language OPS-5.
