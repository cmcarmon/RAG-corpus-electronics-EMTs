The Degenerate Common-Emitter Stage
Consider two CE stages which are identical in every respect but which have no emitter resistor bypass capacitors,
as shown in Fig. 24.38. Also, notice that in these diagrams, two power supply rails have been used, a positive
CC. The reason for this latter, negative, rail is that the bases may be operated
one at V +
CC  are  obtained  from
via  signal  sources  referred  to  a  common  line  or  ground.  (If,  for  example,  V+
batteries as shown, then the common line is simply the junction of the two batteries, as is also shown.) The
absence of capacitors now means that ampliÔ¨Åcation down to dc is possible.
