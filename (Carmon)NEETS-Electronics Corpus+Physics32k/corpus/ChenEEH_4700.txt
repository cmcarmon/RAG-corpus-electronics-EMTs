A power series expansion, provided it exists, often provides a
useful representation of a nonlinear plant. The same can be
said for the desired closed-loop input/output map of a feed-
back control system. Given a Volterra series representation for
each of these components, then Volterra feedback synthesis
(VFS) can be used to design and realize a nonlinear controller
that uses a ﬁnite consecutive number of Volterra kernels of the
plant and desired closed-loop input/output map. A striking
feature of this method is that it permits the speciﬁcation of a
nonlinear desired closed-loop behavior. The control design
takes place in the frequency domain and is realized as an
interconnected set of linear systems. The controller possesses
an interesting recursive structure that is readily exploited to
produce an equivalent reduced-order realization. In fact, this
simpliﬁed controller implementation can be computed to an
arbitrarily high order in an automatic manner.
