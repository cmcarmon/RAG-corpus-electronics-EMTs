ATTENUATION.â€”The fiber optic test method for measuring the attenuation of an installed optical
fiber using an OTDR is EIA/TIA-455-61. The accuracy of this test method depends on the user entering
the appropriate source wavelength, pulse duration, and fiber length (test range) into the OTDR. In
addition, the effective group index of the test fiber is required before the attenuation coefficient and
accurate distances can be recorded. The group index (N) is provided by fiber manufacturers or is found
using EIA/TIA-455-60. By entering correct test parameters, OTDR fiber attenuation values will closely
coincide with those measured by the cutback technique.
