Lenz's law (pronounced ), named after the physicist Heinrich Friedrich Emil Lenz who formulated it in 1834, states that the direction of current induced in a conductor by a changing magnetic field due to induction is such that it creates a magnetic field that opposes the change that produced it.
Lenz's law is shown by the negative sign in Faraday's law of induction:

,


{\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}=-{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial t}},}

which indicates that the induced electromotive force (





E




{\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}}
) and the change in magnetic flux (

Φ


{\displaystyle \partial \Phi }
) have opposite signs. It is a qualitative law that specifies the direction of induced current but says nothing about its magnitude. Lenz's law explains the direction of many effects in electromagnetism, such as the direction of voltage induced in an inductor or wire loop by a changing current, or why eddy currents exert a drag force on moving objects in a magnetic field.
Lenz's law can be seen as analogous to Newton's third law in classic mechanics.
