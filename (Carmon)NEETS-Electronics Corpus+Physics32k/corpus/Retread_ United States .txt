Some applications for retreaded tires are airplanes, racing cars, buses and delivery trucks. Use of retreaded tires was common historically, but as of 2008, it was seldom used for passenger vehicles, mainly due to discomfort on the road, safety issue and cheaper tire brands surfacing in the market. About 17.6 million retreaded tires were sold in North America in 2006.
