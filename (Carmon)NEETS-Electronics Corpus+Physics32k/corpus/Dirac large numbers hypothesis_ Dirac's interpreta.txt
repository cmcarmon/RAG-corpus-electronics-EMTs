The Weyl and Eddington ratios above can be rephrased in a variety of ways, as for instance in the context of time:







c
t


r

e




≈

10

40


,


{\displaystyle {\frac {ct}{r_{e}}}\approx 10^{40},}

where t is the age of the universe,



c


{\displaystyle c}
is the speed of light and re is the classical electron radius. Hence, in units where c=1 and re = 1, the age of the universe is about 1040 units of time. This is the same order of magnitude as the ratio of the electrical to the gravitational forces between a proton and an electron:

{\displaystyle {\frac {e^{2}}{4\pi \epsilon _{0}Gm_{p}m_{e}}}\approx 10^{40}.}

Hence, interpreting the charge

in atomic units (equal to 1), the value of the gravitational constant is approximately 10−40. Dirac interpreted this to mean that



G


{\displaystyle G}
varies with time as

{\displaystyle G\approx 1/t\,}
. Although George Gamov noted that such a temporal variation does not necessarily follow from Dirac's assumptions, a corresponding change of G has not been found. According to general relativity, however, G is constant, otherwise the law of conserved energy is violated. Dirac met this difficulty by introducing into the Einstein field equations a gauge function β that describes the structure of spacetime in terms of a ratio of gravitational and electromagnetic units. He also provided alternative scenarios for the continuous creation of matter, one of the other significant issues in LNH:
'additive' creation (new matter is created uniformly throughout space) and
'multiplicative' creation (new matter is created where there are already concentrations of mass).
