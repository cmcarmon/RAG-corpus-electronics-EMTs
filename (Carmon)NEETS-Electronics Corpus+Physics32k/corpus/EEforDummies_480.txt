Opposing current changes
In Figure 8-6, a DC voltage is applied to a resistor in series with an inductor. 
If there were no inductor in the circuit, a current equal to Vsupply/R would flow 
instantaneously as soon as the DC voltage was switched on. However, intro-
ducing an inductor affects what happens to the current flowing in the circuit.
