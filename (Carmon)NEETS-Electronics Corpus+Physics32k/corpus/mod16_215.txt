Because power is proportional to the current squared, the meter scale can be calibrated to indicate
power units directly. A THERMOCOUPLE AMMETER can be used in this manner for measuring rf
power. The resistor used to replace the normal load is specially designed to have low reactance and the
ability to dissipate the required amount of power. Such resistors are commonly called DUMMY LOADS
or DUMMY ANTENNAS.
