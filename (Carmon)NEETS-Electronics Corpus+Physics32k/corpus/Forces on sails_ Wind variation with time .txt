Hsu gives a simple formula for a gust factor (G ) for winds as a function of the exponent (p ), above, where G is the ratio of the wind gust speed to baseline wind speed at a given height:




G
=
1
+
2
p


{\displaystyle G=1+2p}

So, for a given windspeed and Hsu's recommended value of p = 0.126, one can expect G = 1.5 (a 10-knot wind might gust up to 15 knots). This, combined with changes in wind direction suggest the degree to which a sailing craft must adjust to wind gusts on a given course.
