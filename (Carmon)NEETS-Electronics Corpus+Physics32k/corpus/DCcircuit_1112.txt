For example, an average automotive battery might have a capacity of about 70 amp-hours,
speciﬁed at a current of 3.5 amps. This means that the amount of time this battery could
continuously supply a current of 3.5 amps to a load would be 20 hours (70 amp-hours / 3.5
amps). But let’s suppose that a lower-resistance load were connected to that battery, drawing
70 amps continuously. Our amp-hour equation tells us that the battery should hold out for
exactly 1 hour (70 amp-hours / 70 amps), but this might not be true in real life. With higher
currents, the battery will dissipate more heat across its internal resistance, which has the
effect of altering the chemical reactions taking place within. Chances are, the battery would
fully discharge some time before the calculated time of 1 hour under this greater load.
