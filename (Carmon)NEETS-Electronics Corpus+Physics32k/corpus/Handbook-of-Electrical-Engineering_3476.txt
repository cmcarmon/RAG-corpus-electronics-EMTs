Single-chip packages can be characterized by their internal, or so-called junction-to-case, resistance. The con-
vective heat removal techniques applied to the external surfaces of the package, including the effect of ﬁnned heat
sinks  and  other  thermal  enhancements,  can  be  compared  on  the  basis  of  the  external  thermal  resistance.  The
complexity of heat ﬂow and coolant ﬂow paths in a multichip module generally requires that the thermal capability
of these packaging conﬁgurations be examined on the basis of overall, or chip-to-coolant, thermal resistance.
