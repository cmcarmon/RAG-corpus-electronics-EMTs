Resistors are often used to model devices that convert electrical energy
into  heat  or  other  forms  of  energy.  Such  devices  include  conducting
wire,  light  bulbs,  electric  heaters,  stoves,  ovens,  and  loudspeakers.  In
this section, we will consider two real-life problems that apply the con-
cepts developed in this chapter: electrical lighting systems and design
of dc meters.
