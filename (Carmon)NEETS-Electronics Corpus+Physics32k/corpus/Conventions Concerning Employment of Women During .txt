All conventions entered into force upon or 12 months after the ratification of two ILO member states. For the first conference, implementing law had to be functional on 1 July 1922 at the latest. The revised conventions and the protocol entered into force 12 months after ratification. As common in later ILO conventions, accession to the 1948 automatically meant denouncement of the 1932 convention (but not the 1919 convention). Denouncement is further possible every 10 years in the year following the 10th, 20th, 30th etc. anniversary of the convention.
