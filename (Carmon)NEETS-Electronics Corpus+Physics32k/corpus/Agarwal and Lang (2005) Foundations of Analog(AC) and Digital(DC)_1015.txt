Figure 7.47a depicts another three-terminal device, called the bipolar junction transistor
(BJT), that is in common use in VLSI circuits. A BJT has three terminals called the base
(B), the collector (C), and the emitter (E). Figure 7.47b marks the device with its relevant
voltage and current parameters.
