The moiré bands of Figure 1 will move if we displace the revealing layer. When the revealing layer moves perpendicularly to layer lines, the moiré bands move along the same axis, but several times faster than the movement of the revealing layer.

The GIF animation shown in Figure 4 corresponds to a slow movement of the revealing layer. The GIF file repeatedly animates an upward movement of the revealing layer (perpendicular to layer lines) across a distance equal to pr. The animation demonstrates that the moiré lines of the superposition image move up at a speed, much faster than the movement speed of the revealing layer.
When the revealing layer is shifted up perpendicularly to the layer lines by one full period (pr) of its pattern, the superposition optical image must be the same as the initial one. It means that the moiré lines traverse a distance equal to the period of the superposition image pm while the revealing layer traverses the distance equal to its period pr. Assuming that the base layer is immobile (vb=0), the following equation represents the ratio of the optical speed to the revealing layer’s speed:

{\displaystyle {\frac {v_{m}}{v_{r}}}={\frac {p_{m}}{p_{r}}}.}

By replacing pm with its formula, we have

{\displaystyle {\frac {v_{m}}{v_{r}}}={\frac {p_{b}}{p_{b}-p_{r}}}.}

In case the period of the revealing layer is longer than the period of the base layer, the optical image moves in the opposite direction. The negative value of the ratio computed according to this formula signifies a movement in the reverse direction.
