Inductors have the exact opposite characteristics of capacitors. Whereas capacitors store en-
ergy in an electric ﬁeld (produced by the voltage between two plates), inductors store energy
in a magnetic ﬁeld (produced by the current through wire). Thus, while the stored energy in
a capacitor tries to maintain a constant voltage across its terminals, the stored energy in an
inductor tries to maintain a constant current through its windings. Because of this, inductors
