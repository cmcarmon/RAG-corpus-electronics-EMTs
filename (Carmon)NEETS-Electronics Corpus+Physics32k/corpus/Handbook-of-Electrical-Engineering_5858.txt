The  generator’s  operation  is  based  on  Faraday’s  law  of  electromagnetic  induction.  In  brief,  if  a  coil  (or
winding) is linked to a varying magnetic ﬁeld, then an electromotive force, or voltage, emf, is induced across
the coil. Thus, generators have two essential parts: one creates a magnetic ﬁeld, and the other where the emf ’s
are induced. The magnetic ﬁeld is typically generated by electromagnets (thus, the ﬁeld intensity can be adjusted
. The coils where the
for control purposes), whose windings are referred to as ﬁeld windings or 
. One of these two components is stationary
emf ’s are induced are called 
(stator), and the other is a rotational part (rotor) driven by an external torque. Conceptually, it is immaterial
which of the two components is to rotate because, in either case, the armature circuits always “see” a varying
magnetic ﬁeld. However, practical considerations lead to the common design that for ac generators, the ﬁeld
windings are mounted on the rotor and the armature windings on the stator. In contrast, for dc generators,
the ﬁeld windings are on the stator and armature on the rotor.
