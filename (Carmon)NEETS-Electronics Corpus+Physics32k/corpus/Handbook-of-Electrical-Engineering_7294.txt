Data Services
Both IS-95 and IS-136 systems presently support a “packet-over-circuit” approach to data services. This employs
transmitting packet data originating from an application (usually running over TCP/IP) through a dedicated
wireless  trafﬁc  channel.  Although  such  data  transfer  is  straightforward,  it  is  wasteful  in  that  a  user  may  be
transmitting or receiving blank trafﬁc frames while waiting for a packet burst from the application.
