Before being able to use the minor head losses in an equation, the losses in the system due to friction must also be calculated.
Equation for friction losses:

{\displaystyle H_{Lf}}
= Frictional head loss




v


{\displaystyle v}
= Downstream velocity




g


{\displaystyle g}
= Gravity of Earth





R

{\displaystyle R_{h}}
= Hydraulic radius

{\displaystyle \sum _{i}L_{i}}
=Total length of piping




f


{\displaystyle f}
= Fanning friction factor
