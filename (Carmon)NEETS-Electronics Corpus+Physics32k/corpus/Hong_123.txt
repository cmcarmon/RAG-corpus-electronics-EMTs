When the feedback loop shown in Figure 10.1 is applied to an op amp, a number 
of performance enhancements can be obtained including precise control of the amplifierâ€™s 
gain, 
to  external 
disturbances,  reduced  sensitivity  to  component  variation,  and  active  control  of  circuit 
impedances. As with any feedback system, these performance enhancements come at a 
price:  if  improperly  designed,  the  system  may  become  unstable  and  spontaneous
