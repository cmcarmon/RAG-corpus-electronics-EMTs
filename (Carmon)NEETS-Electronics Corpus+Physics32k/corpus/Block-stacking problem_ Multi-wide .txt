Multi-wide stacks using counterbalancing can give larger overhangs than a single width stack. Even for three blocks, stacking two counterbalanced blocks on top of another block can give an overhang of 1, while the overhang in the simple ideal case is at most 11/12. As Paterson et al. (2007) showed, asymptotically, the maximum overhang that can be achieved by multi-wide stacks is proportional to the cube root of the number of blocks, in contrast to the single-wide case in which the overhang is proportional to the logarithm of the number of blocks.
