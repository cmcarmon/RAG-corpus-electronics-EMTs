When a radio wave is transmitted into an ionized layer, refraction, or bending of the wave, occurs. 
As we discussed earlier, refraction is caused by an abrupt change in the velocity of the upper part of a 
radio wave as it strikes or enters a new medium. The amount of refraction that occurs depends on three 
main factors: (1) the density of ionization of the layer, (2) the frequency of the radio wave, and (3) the 
angle at which the wave enters the layer.
