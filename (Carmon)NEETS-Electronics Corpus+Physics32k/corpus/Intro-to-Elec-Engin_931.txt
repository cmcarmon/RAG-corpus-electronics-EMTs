The strength of the electromagnet and/or the permanent magnet can easily be changed to
observe their effect on the leakage as well as the ï¬‚ux-density distribution, particularly at the air-
gap level and fringing rings. The number of fringing rings and their location may also be easily
changed in order to evaluate their effects on the forces at the air-gap level.
