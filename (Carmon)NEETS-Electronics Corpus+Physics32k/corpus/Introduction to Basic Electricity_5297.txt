Figure 50-8 shows a chart indicating common types 
of defects during printed circuit board assembly. The 
chart indicates that the most common types of defects 
are open and short circuits. An open, or a break, in the 
circuit has an infinite resistance. An open in a circuit 
may not have infinite ohms, but the resistance will be 
so high relative to the other circuit resistances that it 
can be assumed to be infinite. When measuring volt-
age with a voltmeter, connect the negative side of the 
voltmeter to ground. Probe various test points with the 
positive lead. If the open circuit is between a moni-
tored point and ground, the voltmeter will read the 
full supply voltage; otherwise the voltmeter will read 
0 (Figure 50-9).
