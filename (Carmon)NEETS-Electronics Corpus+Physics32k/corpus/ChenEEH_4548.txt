tion viewpoint, the starting point is a speciﬁed collection of
decoupled component differential equations and a set of
coupled algebraic connection equations. Thus, it is possible
to take advantage of the special form of the equations charac-
terizing a large-scale dynamical system and to formulate
analysis procedures that are more efﬁcient than those which
might result from a purely numerical study of the coupled
differential equation characterizing the entire system.
