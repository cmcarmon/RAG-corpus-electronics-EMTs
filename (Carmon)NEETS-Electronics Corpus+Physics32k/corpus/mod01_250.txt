There are two types of variable resistors, one called a POTENTIOMETER and the other a
RHEOSTAT (see views D and E of fig. 1-29.) An example of the potentiometer is the volume control on
your radio, and an example of the rheostat is the dimmer control for the dash lights in an automobile.
There is a slight difference between them. Rheostats usually have two connections, one fixed and the
other moveable. Any variable resistor can properly be called a rheostat. The potentiometer always has
three connections, two fixed and one moveable. Generally, the rheostat has a limited range of values and a
high current-handling capability. The potentiometer has a wide range of values, but it usually has a
limited current-handling capability. Potentiometers are always connected as voltage dividers. (Voltage
dividers are discussed in Chapter 3.)
