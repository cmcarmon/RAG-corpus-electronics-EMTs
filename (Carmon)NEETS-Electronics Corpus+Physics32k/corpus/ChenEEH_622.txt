Of course, the average (relative) error is not the only way to
compare the accuracy of computing systems. Especially true
for signal processing systems, one may use the signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR), assuming that quantization errors represent
noise, to compare the precision of two systems. In that case,
by equating the SNRs of the LNS and the Ô¨Åxed-point system
that covers the required dynamic range, the integer and frac-
tional word lengths of the LNS may be computed.
