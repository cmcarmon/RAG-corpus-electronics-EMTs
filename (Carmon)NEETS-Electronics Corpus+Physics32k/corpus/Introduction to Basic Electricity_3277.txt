Depletion MOSFETs are devices that are normally on. 
That is, they conduct a substantial amount of drain cur-
rent when the gate-to-source voltage is 0. This is useful 
in many applications. It is also useful to have a device 
that is normally off—that is, a  device that conducts only 
when a suitable value of EGS is  applied. Figure  32-12 
shows a MOSFET that functions as a  normally off de-
vice. It is similar to a depletion MOSFET, but it does 
not have a conducting channel. Instead, the source 
and drain regions are diffused  separately into the sub-
strate. The figure shows an N-type substrate and P-type 
source and drain regions. The opposite arrangement 
could also be used. The lead arrangements are the same 
as with a depletion MOSFET.
