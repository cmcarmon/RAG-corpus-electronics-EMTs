The amount of circuit resistance to be measured may vary over a wide range. In some cases, it may
only be a few ohms; in other cases, it may be as great as 1 megohm. Scale multiplication features are built
into most ohmmeters so that they will indicate any ohmic value being measured and offer the least
amount of error. Most ohmmeters are equipped with a selector switch for selecting the multiplication
scale desired. For example, view A of figure 3-14 shows a typical meter that has a six-position switch.
The positions are marked on the meter in multiples of 10, from R ·  1 through R ·  100K.
