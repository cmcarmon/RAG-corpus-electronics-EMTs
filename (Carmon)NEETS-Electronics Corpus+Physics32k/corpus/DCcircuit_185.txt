There are circuit components speciﬁcally engineered to provide nonlinear resistance curves,
one of them being the varistor. Commonly manufactured from compounds such as zinc oxide
or silicon carbide, these devices maintain high resistance across their terminals until a cer-
tain ”ﬁring” or ”breakdown” voltage (equivalent to the ”ionization potential” of an air gap)
is reached, at which point their resistance decreases dramatically. Unlike the breakdown of
an insulator, varistor breakdown is repeatable: that is, it is designed to withstand repeated
breakdowns without failure. A picture of a varistor is shown here:
