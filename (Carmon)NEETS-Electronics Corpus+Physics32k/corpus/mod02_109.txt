 Since an inductor (coil) consists of a number of turns of wire, and since all wire has some resistance, 
every inductor has a certain amount of resistance. Normally this resistance is small. It is usually neglected 
in solving various types of ac circuit problems because the reactance of the inductor (the opposition to 
alternating current, which will be discussed later) is so much greater than the resistance that the resistance 
has a negligible effect on the current.
