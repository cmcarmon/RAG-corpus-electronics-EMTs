In addition to its reactive properties, the capacitor under test always exhibits some loss. This loss
may have the characteristics of either a shunt or series resistance, or it may be a combination of both.
Regardless of its true nature, the loss can always be represented as a simple series resistance, which is
shown in figure 1-12 as R
