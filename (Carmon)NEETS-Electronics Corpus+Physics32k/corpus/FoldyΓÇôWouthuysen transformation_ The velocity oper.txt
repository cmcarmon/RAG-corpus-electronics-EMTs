Now, let us consider the velocity operator. To obtain this operator, we must commute the Hamiltonian operator Ĥ′0 with the canonical position operators xi, i.e., we must calculate








v

i


^



≡
i

[





H
^




0


,

x

i



]



{\displaystyle {\hat {v_{i}}}\equiv i\left[{\hat {H}}_{0},x_{i}\right]}

One good way to approach this calculation, is to start by writing the scalar rest mass m as




m
=

γ

0






H
^




0


+

γ

j



p

j




{\displaystyle m=\gamma ^{0}{\hat {H}}_{0}+\gamma ^{j}p_{j}}

and then to mandate that the scalar rest mass commute with the xi. Thus, we may write:

where we have made use of the Heisenberg canonical commutation relationship [xi,pj] = −iηij to reduce terms. Then, multiplying from the left by γ0 and rearranging terms, we arrive at:

Because the canonical relationship

{\displaystyle i\left[{\hat {H}}_{0},{\hat {v}}_{i}\right]\neq 0}

the above provides the basis for computing an inherent, non-zero acceleration operator, which specifies the oscillatory motion known as zitterbewegung.
