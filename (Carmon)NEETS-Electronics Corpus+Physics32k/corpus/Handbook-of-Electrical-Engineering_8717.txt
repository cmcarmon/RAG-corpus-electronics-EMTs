The  FORTRAN  program  containing  the  example  statement  is  treated  like  input  data  by  the  translating
program which produces a machine-level sequence as output. In general, the input data is called the source
program, and the resulting translated output is called the object program. There are two ways to obtain an
object program from a source program: compiling and interpreting.
