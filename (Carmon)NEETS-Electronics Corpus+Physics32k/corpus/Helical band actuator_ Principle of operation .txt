The telescoping column is formed by a pair of interlocking stainless steel bands. One band has a vertical rectangular profile and the other horizontal, much like an oversized Slinky. The vertical band spirals up on itself into a stacked helix, forming the wall of the column, while at the same time, the horizontal band interlocks the continuous spiral seam of the vertical band. When the column lowers, the bands separate and retract into two compact coils. The bands are combined, separated and stored by an assembly located at the base of the column. The result is an efficient (50%-80%) telescoping lifting column.
To incorporate the device into a lift system, multiple helical band actuators are arranged below the lift platform where they are powered by an electric motor(s) and synchronized transmission. Helical band actuators require a separate lateral support mechanism, usually provided in the form of guide rails or self-guiding frame, such as a pantograph (e.g. a scissor lift).
