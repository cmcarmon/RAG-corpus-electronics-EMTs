If some of the branch currents in a circuit are known, then it is possible that KCL alone
can be used to find other branch currents in the circuit. For example, consider the circuit
in Figure 2.8 with i1 = 1 A and i3 = 3 A, as shown in Figure 2.9. Using Equation 2.5,
namely KCL for Node 1, it can be seen that i2 = −4 A. This is all that can be learned
from KCL alone given the information in Figure 2.9.
But, if we further know that i5 = −2 A, for example, we can learn from KCL applied
to the other nodes that i4 = −2 A and i6 = −1 A.
