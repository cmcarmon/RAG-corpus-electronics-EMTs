Frequency Modulation
Frequency-modulation (FM) broadcasting refers to the transmission of voice and music received by the general
public in the 88- to 108-MHz frequency band. FM is used to provide higher-Ô¨Ådelity reception than is available
with standard broadcast AM. In 1961 stereophonic broadcasting was introduced with the addition of a double-
sideband  suppressed  carrier  for  transmission  of  a  left-minus-right  difference  signal.  The  left-plus-right  sum
channel is sent with use of normal FM. Some FM broadcast systems also include a subsidiary communications
authorization  (SCA)  subcarrier  for  private  commercial  uses.  FM  broadcast  is  typically  limited  to  line-of-sight
ranges. As a result, FM coverage is localized to a range of 75 mi (120 km) depending on the antenna height and ERP.
