OHMMETERS are used to measure resistance and to check continuity. An ohmmeter is connected
in series with the resistance being measured. The ohmmeter range which allows a midscale indication
should be selected. Resistors are used to allow an ohmmeter to have several ranges. In a SERIES
OHMMETER the resistors are used in series with the resistance being measured. Series ohmmeters have
the 0 indication on the right side of the scale.
