User Interfaces
Over the years, user interaction with computers has become progressively more direct. In the very early days,
the  user  interface  was  another  human  being.  These “operators”  were  gradually  replaced  by 
operating  systems
which provided communication ﬁrst through the medium of punch-card and paper tape, then later by teletype
machines,  text-based  visual  display  units,  and,  most  recently,  by  windowed  graphical  user  interfaces.  Along
with this change, there has been a corresponding change in style for CACSD tools. Batch mode programs were
collected into “packages” and provided with question and answer or menued interfaces. These, in turn, have
been  largely  superceded  by  command  driven  interfaces  and  direct-manipulation  graphical  user  interfaces,
currently used only for specialized tasks such as block-diagram input, will have a wider role in future CACSD
packages.
