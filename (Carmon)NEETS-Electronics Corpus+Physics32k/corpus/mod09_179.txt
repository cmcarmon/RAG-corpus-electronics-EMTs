Resonant circuits can be made to serve as filters in a manner similar to the action of individual 
capacitors and inductors. As you know, the series-LC circuit offers minimum opposition to currents that 
have frequencies at or near the resonant frequency, and maximum opposition to currents of all other 
frequencies.
