The problem with MAP is that it adapts only parameters for which explicit training data is available, and it
converges slowly for tasks where there are limited adaptation data and many parameters to be estimated. Many
adaptation algorithms [15] [14] have been developed which attempt to generalize from “nearby” training data
points to overcome this difﬁculty.
