We will show that the incremental model for a linear resistor of value R is also a resistor
of value R. Intuitively, since the v i relation for a linear resistor is a straight line, the
slope (given by 1/R) is the same for all values of the resistor voltage and current. Further,
since the incremental resistance r is the reciprocal of the slope, it follows that r = R.
