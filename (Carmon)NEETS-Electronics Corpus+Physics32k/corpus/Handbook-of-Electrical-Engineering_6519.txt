FM or CDV systems have much less restrictive linearity requirements, because of the reduced sensitivity to
impairment.  Distortion  products  must  be  counted,  as  with  the  AM-VSB  example  described  previously,  but
each product is no longer dominated by the remaining carrier. Because the carrier is suppressed entirely by the
modulation,  each  product  is  distributed  over  more  than  the  bandwidth  of  each  channel.  The  impairment
resulting from the superposition of many uncorrelated distortion products resembles noise. Quantities analo-
gous to the CSO and CTB can be deÔ¨Åned for these systems.
