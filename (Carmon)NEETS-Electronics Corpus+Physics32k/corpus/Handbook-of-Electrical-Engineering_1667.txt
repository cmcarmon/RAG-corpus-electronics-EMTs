in which ψ
k is a sufﬁcient statistic for x. A recursive ﬁlter exists when there is a sufﬁcient statistic with ﬁxed
ﬁnite dimension. In classical statistics, for parameter estimation, it is well known that this will happen (assuming
certain regularity conditions) if and only if the conditional density is from an exponential family; see Daum
[1988].  The  theory  of  ﬁxed  ﬁnite  dimensional  ﬁlters  has  also  been  developed  from  a  completely  different
perspective, using Lie algebras; see Bene˘s [1987].
