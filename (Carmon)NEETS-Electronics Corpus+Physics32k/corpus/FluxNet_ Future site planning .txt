Future FluxNet sites are planned according to a desirable accuracy in the acquired data. With the current model used to determine flux between the surface and the atmosphere, it is desirable to situate the tower in an area with uniform vegetative cover and minimal disturbances in the terrain. Deviations in terrain or plant cover would prevent a constant gas flux along the height of the tower.
Another very important part of the sensor array is the tower on which it rests. The sensor tower must fit within a certain design criteria dependent on:
the height of the vegetation in the area
the average wind speed
the sampling time of the sensors
Typically, investigators who are monitoring fluxes in agricultural cropland place their sensors close to the ground. Meanwhile, scientists who hope to measure the fluxes in tall forests must place their sensors on relatively high scaffolding. The difference in sizes is attributed to the boundary layers that form close to the ground because of the vegetation. To minimize turbulence from the tower itself, instrumentation is often placed at the top of the tower and offset several feet with the help of booms.
