 A coil can be made still more inductive by winding it in three layers, as shown in figure 2-9(C). The 
increased number of layers (cross-sectional area) improves flux linkage even more. Note that some turns, 
such as Y, lie directly next to six other turns (shaded). In actual practice, layering can continue on through 
many more layers. The important fact to remember, however, is that the inductance of the coil increases 
with each layer added.
