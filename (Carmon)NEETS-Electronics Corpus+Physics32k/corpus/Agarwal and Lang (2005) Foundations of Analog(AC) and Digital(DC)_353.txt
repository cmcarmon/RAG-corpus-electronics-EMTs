Our intuitive analysis concludes by expanding the circuit in Figure 2.51d
progressively. As we expand, we determine the values of as many of the variables
as we can in terms of previously computed variables. Following this process,
first, the circuit in Figure 2.51c can be viewed as a voltage divider of v0. In other
words, i1 can be multiplied by each of its two resistances to determine v1 and
v2. Thus,
