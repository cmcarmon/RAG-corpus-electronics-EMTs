In	a	circuitâ€™s	electromagnetic	field,	it	is	important	to	remember	that	charged
elements	tend	to	move	radically;	sometimes,	predicting	the	direction	of	the	electric
flow	is	nearly	impossible.	While	others	go	about	in	a	non-linear	network,	many
charges	obey	the	rule	of	superposition	since	they	adhere	to	a	linear	path.	With	the
use	of	certain	laws	as	basis,	the	relationship	between	the	charged	elements	can	be
evaluated.
