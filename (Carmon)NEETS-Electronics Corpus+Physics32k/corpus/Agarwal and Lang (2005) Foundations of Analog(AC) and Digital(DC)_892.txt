Similarly, inverting devices such as inverters or NAND gates must convert
input low to high transitions of the form VIL → VIH to output high to low
transitions of the form VOH → VOL. Like the non-inverting case, the conditions
on the magnitude of the gain for transitions from VIL → VIH remain unchanged.
Returning to our buffer example, the gain for the VIL → VIH transition is
