A control system is said to possess integral-error control when the generation of the output in
some way depends upon the integral of the actuating signal. By designing the servoampliﬁer such
that it makes available an output voltage that contains an integral term and a proportional term,
integral-error control can be obtained. By modifying the transfer function of the servoampliﬁer in
the block diagram, the complete block diagram of the servomechanism with integral-error control
is shown in Figure 16.2.14, where Ki is the proportionality factor of the integral-error component.
The direct transmission function is then given by
