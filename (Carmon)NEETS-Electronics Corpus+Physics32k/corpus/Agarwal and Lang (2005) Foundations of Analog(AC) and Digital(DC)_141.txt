a c h i p Figure 1.15 shows several pieces of material with varying geometries.
Assume all the pieces have the same thickness. In other words, the pieces of material
are planar. Let us determine the resistance of these pieces between the pairs of terminals
shown. For a given thickness, remember that the resistance of a piece of material in the
shape of a cuboid is determined by the ratio of the length to the width of the piece of
material (Equation 1.6). Assuming that Ro is the resistance of a piece of planar material
