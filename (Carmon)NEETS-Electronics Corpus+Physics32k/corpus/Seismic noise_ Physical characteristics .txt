The amplitude of seismic noise vibrations is typically in the order of 0.1 to 10 Î¼m/s. High and low noise models as a function of frequency have been proposed.
The seismic noise includes a small amount of body waves (P- and S-waves), but surface waves (Love and Rayleigh waves) predominate. These waves are dispersive, meaning that their phase velocity varies with frequency (generally, it decreases with increasing frequency). Since the dispersion curve (phase velocity or slowness as a function of frequency) is tightly related to the variations of the shear-wave velocity with depth in the different ground layers, it can be used as a non-invasive tool to investigate the underground structure.
