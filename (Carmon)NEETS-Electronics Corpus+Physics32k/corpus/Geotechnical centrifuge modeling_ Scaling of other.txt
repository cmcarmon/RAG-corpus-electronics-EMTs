(this section obviously needs work!)
scale factors for energy, force, pressure, acceleration, velocity, etc. Note that stress has units of pressure, or force per unit area. Thus we can show that
Substituting F = m∙a (Newton's law, force = mass ∙ acceleration) and r = m/L3 (from the definition of mass density).
Scale factors for many other quantities can be derived from the above relationships. The table below summarizes common scale factors for centrifuge testing.
