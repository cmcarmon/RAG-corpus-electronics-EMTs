The sequence of binary digits from the source encoder, known as the information sequence,
is passed on to the channel encoder. The purpose of the channel encoder is to introduce some
redundancy in a controlled manner in the binary information sequence, so that the redundancy
can be used at the receiver to overcome the effects of noise and interference encountered in the
transmission of the signal through the channel. Thus, redundancy in the information sequence
helps the receiver in decoding the desired information sequence, thereby increasing the reliability
of the received data and improving the Ô¨Ådelity of the received signal.
