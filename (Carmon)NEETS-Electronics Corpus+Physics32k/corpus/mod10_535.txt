Since the impedance a generator sees at the quarter-wave point in a shorted line is that of a parallel-
resonant circuit, a shorted quarter-wave- length of line may be used as a parallel-resonant circuit (figure
3-31, view C). An open quarter-wavelength of line may be used as a series-resonant circuit (view D). The
Q of such a resonant line is much greater than can be obtained with lumped capacitance and inductance.
