This instruction loads a copy of the operand at memory location MEMLOC into the processor register Ri. The
instruction  requires  a  few  basic  steps  to  be  performed.  First,  the  instruction  must  be  transferred  from  the
memory into the processor, where it is decoded. Then the operand at location MEMLOC must be fetched into
the  processor.  Finally,  the  operand  is  placed  into  register  R1.  After  operands  are  loaded  into  the  processor
registers in this way, instructions such as ADD Ri, Rj, Rk can be used to add the contents of registers Ri and
Rj, and then place the result into register Rk.
