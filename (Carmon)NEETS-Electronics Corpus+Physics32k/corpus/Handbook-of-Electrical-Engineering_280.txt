Thus,  the  presence  of  a  voltage  source  in  the  network  actually
simpliÔ¨Åes  a  node  analysis.  In  an  attempt  to  generalize  this  idea,
consider the network in Fig. 3.6. Note that in this case V1 = 12 V and
the difference between node voltages V3 and V2 is constrained to be
6 V. Hence, two of the three equations needed to solve for the node
voltages in the network are
