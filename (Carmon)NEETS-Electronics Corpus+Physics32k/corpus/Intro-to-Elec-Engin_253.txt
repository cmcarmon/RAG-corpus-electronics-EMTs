So far we have considered circuits with only one energy-storage element, which are known
as ﬁrst-order circuits, characterized by ﬁrst-order differential equations, regardless of how many
resistors the circuit may contain. Now let us take up series LC and parallel LC circuits, both
involving the two storage elements, as shown in Figures 3.2.2 and 3.2.3, which are known as
second-order circuits characterized by second-order differential equations.
