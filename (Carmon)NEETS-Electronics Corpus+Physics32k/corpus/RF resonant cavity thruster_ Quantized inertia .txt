A 2017 paper in EPL by Mike McCulloch a lecturer in geomatics at Plymouth University, describes a method by which thrust from resonant cavities could be predicted using his own controversial approach of quantization of inertia, the "Modified Inertia Hubble-scale Casimir effect" (MiHsC).
While this model allows the device to create thrust without breaking Newton's third law, it assumes that Unruh radiation is real. The mechanism involves more Unruh radiation fitting the wide end of the cavity than its narrow end, continuously shifting the center of inertial mass of the microwaves towards the wide end: the cavity then has to move towards the small end, for momentum to be conserved.
This hypothesis is testable, and McCulloch has suggested building a cavity where the length of the cavity is the same as the diameter of the small end, causing Unruh radiation to fit better in the small end, resulting in a reversal of thrust.
