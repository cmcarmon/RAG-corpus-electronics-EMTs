Commutation: Process of transferring the current from one power device to another.
Duty cycle: Ratio of the on-time of a switch to the switching period.
Full-wave control: Both the positive and negative half cycle of the waveforms are controlled.
IGBT:
Phase-controlled converter: Converter in which the power devices are turned off at the natural crossing of
