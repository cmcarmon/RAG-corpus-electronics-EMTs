A p=4-shifted QPSK signal constellation in Figure 4.8 con-
sists of symbols corresponding to eight phases. These eight
phase points can be considered to be formed by superimposing
two QPSK signal constellations, offset by 45 degrees relative to
each other. During each symbol period, a phase angle from
only one of the two QPSK constellations is transmitted. The
two constellations are used alternately to transmit every pair of
bits (di-bits). Thus, successive symbols have a relative phase
difference that is one of the four phases shown in Table 4.1.
