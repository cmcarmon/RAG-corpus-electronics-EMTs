Dehydrators or compressor-dehydrators are supplied as part of various radars. Many of them were 
provided prior to installation of properly configured central dry-air systems. These dehydrators are 
intended for emergency use in the event of the failure of the central dry-air system. In a typical 
configuration (figure 4-14), the outlet air from the local dehydrator is connected between the air control 
panel outlet and the user equipment or radar by a three-way valve.
