There are many other important measures of probability distance. Some of these are particularly connected with the Kullback–Leibler divergence. For example:
The total variation distance,



δ
(
p
,
q
)


{\displaystyle \delta (p,q)}
. This is connected to the divergence through Pinsker's inequality:



δ
(
P
,
Q
)
≤

D


K
L



(
P
‖
Q
)




{\displaystyle \delta (P,Q)\leq {\sqrt {{\frac {1}{2}}D_{\mathrm {KL} }(P\|Q)}}}

The family of Rényi divergences provide generalizations of the Kullback–Leibler divergence. Depending on the value of a certain parameter,



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }
, various inequalities may be deduced.
Other notable measures of distance include the Hellinger distance, histogram intersection, Chi-squared statistic, quadratic form distance, match distance, Kolmogorov–Smirnov distance, and earth mover's distance.
