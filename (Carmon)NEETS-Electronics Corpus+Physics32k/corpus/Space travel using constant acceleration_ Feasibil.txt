A major limiting factor for constant acceleration drives is having enough fuel. Imagine a horse strong enough to pull a wagon carrying enough hay to feed it on a journey from New York City to Los Angeles. Constant acceleration won't be feasible until the specific impulse for fuel (in layman's terms, the fuel efficiency) has become much higher.
There are two broad categories for ways to solve this problem: one is higher efficiency fuel (the motor ship approach) and the other is drawing propulsion energy from the environment as the ship passes through it (the sailing ship approach). Two possibilities for the motor ship approach are nuclear and matter–antimatter based fuels. One possibility for the sailing ship approach is discovering something equivalent to the parallelogram of force between wind and water which allows sails to propel a sailing ship.
Picking up fuel along the way—the ramjet approach—will lose efficiency as the space craft's speed increases relative to the planetary reference. This happens because the fuel must be accelerated to the spaceship's velocity before its energy can be extracted and that will cut the fuel efficiency dramatically.
A related issue is drag. If the near light speed space craft is interacting with matter or energy that is moving slowly in the planetary reference frame—solar wind, magnetic fields, cosmic microwave background radiation—this will cause drag which will bleed off a portion of the engine's acceleration.
A second big issue facing ships using constant acceleration for interstellar travel is colliding with matter and radiation while en route. In mid-journey any matter the ship strikes will be impacting at near light speed, so the impact will be dramatic.
