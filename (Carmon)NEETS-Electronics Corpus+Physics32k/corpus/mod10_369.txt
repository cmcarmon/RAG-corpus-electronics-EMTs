If a transmitting antenna extends into such a duct of cool air, or if the radio wave enters the duct at a 
very low angle of incidence, vhf and uhf transmissions may be propagated far beyond normal 
line-of-sight distances. When ducts are present as a result of temperature inversions, good reception of 
vhf and uhf television signals from a station located hundreds of miles away is not unusual. These long
