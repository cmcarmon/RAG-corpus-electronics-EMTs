In practice, accuracy is also constrained by environmental effects, target characteristics, and instrumentation
.  Environmental  effects  include  multipath  and  refraction.  Target  glint  is
error  as  well  as  the  available 
characterized by an apparent wandering of the target position because of coherent interference effects associated
with  the  composite  return  from  the  individual  scattering  centers  on  the  target.  Instrumentation  error  is
minimized with alignment and calibration but may signiﬁcantly constrain track ﬁlter performance as a result
of the relatively long correlation interval of some error sources.
