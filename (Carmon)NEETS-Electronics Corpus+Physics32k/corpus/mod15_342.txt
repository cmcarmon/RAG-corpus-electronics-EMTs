In the second group, the gyro's spin axis is either parallel to the surface of the Earth or at some angle 
other than perpendicular. The spin axis of the gyro in the gyrocompass, for example, is maintained in a 
plane parallel to the surface of the Earth It is aligned in a plane of the north-south meridian. Once set, it 
will continue to point north as long as no disturbing force causes it to precess out of the plane of the 
meridian.
