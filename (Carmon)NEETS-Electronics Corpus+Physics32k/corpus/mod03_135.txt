While ammeters are always connected in series, voltmeters are always connected in parallel. Figure
1-25 (and the following figures) use resistors to represent the voltmeter movement. Since a meter
movement can be considered as a resistor, the concepts illustrated are true for voltmeters as well as
resistors. For simplicity, dc circuits are shown, but the principles apply to both ac and dc voltmeters.
