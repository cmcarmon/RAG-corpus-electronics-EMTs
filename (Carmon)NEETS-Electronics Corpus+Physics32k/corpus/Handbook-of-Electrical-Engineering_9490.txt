The  relation  exhibits  the  following  transitive  dependency:  client_name ﬁ  supplier_name,  supplier_name
ﬁ location (but not the inverse). The relation CLIENT is clearly in 2NF, but because of the transitive dependency
of the nonprime attribute location on the key, it is not in 3NF. This is the cause of the anomalies mentioned
above. Eliminating this transitive dependency by splitting the schema into two components will remove these
anomalies. Clearly, the resulting two relations SUP_CLI and SUP_LOC are in 3NF (see Fig. 94.6).
