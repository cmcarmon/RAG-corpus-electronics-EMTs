It can be shown that when the process X(t) is memoryless and stationary (i.e., when x1, …, xn are independent,
identically  distributed)  then  the  ML  estimators  are  consistent,  asymptotically  efﬁcient,  and  asymptotically
Gaussian.
i : xi ˛
Example: Let xi , i = 1,…, n, be Gaussian independent random variables with mean q and variance  s 2
i ). The mean q is to be estimated and the Rao-Cramèr bound is to be evaluated. Since q is unknown
N(q,s 2
but ﬁxed, we will use the maximum likelihood estimation scheme. The random variable xi has the probability
