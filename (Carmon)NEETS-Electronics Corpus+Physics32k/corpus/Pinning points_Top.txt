In a crystalline material, a dislocation is capable of traveling throughout the lattice when relatively small stresses are applied. This movement of dislocations results in the material plastically deforming. Pinning points in the material act to halt a dislocation's movement, requiring a greater amount of force to be applied to overcome the barrier. This results in an overall strengthening of materials.
