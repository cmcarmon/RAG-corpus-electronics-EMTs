computers. Likewise, the ﬁltering theory for continuous time measurements (which dominates the academic
literature on nonlinear ﬁltering) is also impractical because measurements must be made in discrete time to
accommodate digital computers. The naïve approximation of discrete time measurements by continuous time
data generally results in poor performance, and it is not used by practical engineers. The academic literature
is out of touch with such practical issues; for example, see Hazewinkel et al. [1981].
