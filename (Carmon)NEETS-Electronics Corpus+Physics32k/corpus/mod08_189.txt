The actual circuit components are: C1, C2, C3, R1, R2, R3, and Q1. C1 is used to couple the input
signal. R1 develops the input signal. R2, the emitter resistor, is used for proper biasing and temperature
stability. C2 is a decoupling capacitor for R2. R3 develops the output signal. C3 couples the output signal
to the next stage. Q1 is the amplifying device.
