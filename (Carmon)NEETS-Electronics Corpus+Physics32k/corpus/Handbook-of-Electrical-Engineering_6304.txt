In an encoded video signal, a series of 2X line frequency pulses occurring during vertical
blanking, before and after the vertical synchronizing pulse. Different numbers of equalizing pulses are
inserted into different ﬁelds to ensure that each ﬁeld begins and ends at the right time to produce proper
interlace. The 2X line rate also serves to maintain horizontal synchronization during vertical blanking.
