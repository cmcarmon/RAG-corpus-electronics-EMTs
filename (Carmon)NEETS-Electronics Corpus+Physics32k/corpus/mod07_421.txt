From the formula, you can see that if frequency or capacitance is increased, the XC decreases. Since 
filter capacitors are placed in parallel with the load, a low XC will provide better filtering than a high XC. 
For this to be accomplished, a better shunting effect of the ac around the load is provided, as shown in 
figure 4-10.
