A system that is overdamped [Figure E3.2.5(a)] responds slowly to any change in excitation.
The critically damped system [Figure E3.2.5(b)] responds smoothly in the speediest fashion
to approach the steady-state value. The underdamped system [Figure E3.2.5(c)] responds most
quickly accompanied by overshoot, which makes the response exceed and oscillate about the
