s
 contains the coefﬁcients
where 
s
 is fourth rank. Note, however,
connecting the two. All quantities are tensors; 
that usually contracted notation is used so that the full complement of subscripts is not visible. PZT converts
 and
d
electrical ﬁelds into mechanical displacements and vice versa. The connection between the two is via the 
g
  coefﬁcients.  The 
g
coefﬁcients give the ﬁeld across the device when a stress is applied (receiver). The electrical effects are added
to the basic Eq. (49.1) such that
