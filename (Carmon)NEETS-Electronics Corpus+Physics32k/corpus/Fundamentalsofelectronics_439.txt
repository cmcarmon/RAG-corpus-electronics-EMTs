Figure 4.13: The vocal tract is shown in cross-section. Air pressure produced by the lungs forces air
through the vocal cords that, when under tension, produce puï¬€s of air that excite resonances in the vocal
and nasal cavities. What are not shown are the brain and the musculature that control the entire speech
production process.
