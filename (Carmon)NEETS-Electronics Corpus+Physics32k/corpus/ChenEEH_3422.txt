Distance relaying belongs to the principle of ratio compari-
son. The ratio is between the voltage and current, which in turn
produces impedance. The impedance is proportional to the
distance in transmission lines, hence the ‘‘distance relaying’’
designation for the principle. This principle is primarily used
for protection of high-voltage transmission lines. In this case,
the overcurrent principle cannot easily cope with the change in
the direction of the ﬂow of power, simultaneous with variations
in the level of the current ﬂow, which is common in the trans-
mission but not so common in the radial distribution lines.
Computing the impedance in a three-phase system is a bit
involved because each type of fault produces a different imped-
ance expression (Lewis, 1947). Because of these differences the
settings of a distance relay need to be selected to distinguish
between the ground and phase faults. In addition, fault resis-
tance may create problems for distance measurements because
the value of the fault resistance may be difﬁcult to predict. It is
particularly challenging for distance relays to measure correct
fault impedance when a current in-feed from the other end of
the line creates an unknown voltage drop on the fault resistance.
This may contribute to erroneous computation of the imped-
ance, called apparent impedence, ‘‘seen’’ by the relay located at
one end of the line and using the current and voltage measure-
ment just from that end. Once the impedance is computed, it is
compared to the settings that deﬁne the operating characteristic
of a relay. Based on the comparison, a decision is made if a fault
has occurred and, if so, in what zone. As mentioned earlier, the
