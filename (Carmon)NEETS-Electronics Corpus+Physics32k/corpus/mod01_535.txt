A reference point is an arbitrarily chosen point to which all other points in the circuit are compared.
In series circuits, any point can be chosen as a reference and the electrical potential at all other points can
be determined in reference to that point. In figure 3-28 point A shall be considered the reference point.
Each series resistor in the illustrated circuit is of equal value. The applied voltage is equally distributed
across each resistor. The potential at point B is 25 volts more positive than at point A. Points C and D are
50 volts and 75 volts more positive than point A respectively.
