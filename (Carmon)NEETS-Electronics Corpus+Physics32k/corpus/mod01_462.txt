Figure 3-7 shows the graph and a table of values. This table shows R held constant at 10 ohms as E
is varied from 0 to 20 volts in 5-volt steps. Through the use of Ohmâ€™s law, you can calculate the value of
current for each value of voltage shown in the table. When the table is complete, the information it
contains can be used to construct the graph shown in figure 3-7. For example, when the voltage applied to
the 10-ohm resistor is 10 volts, the current is 1 ampere. These values of current and voltage determine a
point on the graph. When all five points have been plotted, a smooth curve is drawn through the points.
