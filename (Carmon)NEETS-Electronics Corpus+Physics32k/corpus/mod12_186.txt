The analysis has been simplified further by using a frequency of 8 hertz to represent the carrier 
frequency. Each cycle of the carrier then requires 1/8 of a second to complete 360 degrees. The carrier 
will be 100-percent modulated by a sine wave having a frequency of 1 hertz, thereby producing sideband 
frequencies of 7 and 9 hertz.
