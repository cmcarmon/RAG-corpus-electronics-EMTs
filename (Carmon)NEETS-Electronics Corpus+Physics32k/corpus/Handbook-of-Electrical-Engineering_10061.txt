The  results  of  this  comparison  are  shown  in  the  curves  of  Fig. 100.55.  The  distinguishing  feature  of  this
comparison is the ﬂattening effect of the H∞ controller. Although this is a plot of a frequency response magnitude
and not the maximum singular value, it is apparent that the H∞ controller is reducing the peak response, while
the H2 controller is reducing the average response and providing faster roll-off in the frequency domain.
