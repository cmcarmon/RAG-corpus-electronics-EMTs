For the circuit in Figure 15.77, find vO in terms of vI. Ana-
lyze with literal resistor values, then substitute numbers: R1 = R2 = R3 = 10 k,
R4 = 100 .

This question concerns the circuit illustrated in Figure 15.78:
The operational amplifier is a high gain unit (A = 105) with high input resistance, ri,
and negligibly low output resistance, rt. Assume that it is operating in its linear region.
