The reduced memory requirements of audio coded in MP3
format has made it a popular vehicle for exchanging and storing
music by individual users. MP3 refers to the MPEG Layer 3
audio compression format. Raw digital audio signals typically
consist of 16-bit samples acquired at a sampling rate that is at
least twice the bandwidth of the audio signal. In compact discs
(CDs), a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz is used for each channel of
stereo music. As a result, more than 1.4 Mbits is needed to
represent just 1 second of music in raw CD recordings. By
using MP3 audio coding, the storage requirement is reduced
by a factor of 12 to 14 without signiﬁcant loss in sound quality.
This saving in storage is realized by using a signal processing
tool, called a ﬁlter bank, in conjunction with exploiting the
nature of perception of sound waves by the human ear.
