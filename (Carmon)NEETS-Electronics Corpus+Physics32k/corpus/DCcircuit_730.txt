When using standard ammeters that connect in series with the circuit being measured, it
might not be practical or possible to redesign the meter for a lower input (lead-to-lead) re-
sistance. However, if we were selecting a value of shunt resistor to place in the circuit for a
current measurement based on voltage drop, and we had our choice of a wide range of resis-
tances, it would be best to choose the lowest practical resistance for the application. Any more
resistance than necessary and the shunt may impact the circuit adversely by adding excessive
resistance in the current path.
