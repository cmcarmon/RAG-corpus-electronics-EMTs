Multipliers
Parallel multipliers have more complex structures than parallel
adders. For example, an array multiplier has Q(n) diagonals of
linearly connected full adders, where n is the input length in
bits, whereas the Wallace tree multiplier has a tree structure.
The trick to applying REMOD to such complex structures is to
bit-slice them and add some components, if needed, to bit-
slice i þ 1 so that it can cover bit-slice i. Each bit slice is then
a cell of the circuit pertaining to the deﬁnition of covering
and related concepts discussed earlier. Figure 8.3 shows a
