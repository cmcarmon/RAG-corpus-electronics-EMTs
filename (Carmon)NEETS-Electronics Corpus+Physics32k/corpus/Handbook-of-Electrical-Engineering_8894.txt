A  physical  address  can  also  be  broken  into  two  parts,  a  physical  page  number  (also  called  a  page  frame
number) and an offset. This mapping is done at the level of pages, so the page table can be indexed by means
of the virtual page number. The page frame number is contained in the page table and is read out during the
translation, along with other information about the page. In most implementations the page offset is the same
for a virtual address and the physical address to which it is mapped.
