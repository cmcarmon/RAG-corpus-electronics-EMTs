Here is an illustration showing the so-called "centrifugal term"



r




θ
˙




2




{\displaystyle r{\dot {\theta }}^{2}}
does not transform as a true force, putting any reference to this term not just as a "term", but as a centrifugal force, in a dubious light. Suppose in frame S a particle moves radially away from the origin at a constant velocity. See Figure 2. The force on the particle is zero by Newton's first law. Now we look at the same thing from frame S' , which is the same, but displaced in origin. In S' the particle still is in straight line motion at constant speed, so again the force is zero.
What if we use polar coordinates in the two frames? In frame S the radial motion is constant and there is no angular motion. Hence, the acceleration is:

and each term individually is zero because

In this case the azimuthal term is zero, being the rate of change of angular momentum. To obtain zero acceleration in the radial direction, however, we require:

{\displaystyle r{\dot {\theta }}^{2}}

{\displaystyle {\ddot {r}}}

See the article on general covariance. To attempt to form a covariant expression, this so-called centrifugal "force" can be put into vector notation as:

{\displaystyle {\dot {\theta }}}
changes (see Figure 2), so observers in the same frame of reference standing on different street corners see different "forces" even though the actual events they witness are identical. How can a physical force (be it fictitious or real) be zero in one frame S, but non-zero in another frame S' identical, but a few feet away? Even for exactly the same particle behavior the expression

{\displaystyle r{\dot {\theta }}^{2}}

{\displaystyle r{\dot {\theta }}^{2}}

Beyond this problem, the real impressed net force is zero. (There is no real impressed force in straight-line motion at constant speed). If we adopt polar coordinates, and wish to say that

2




{\displaystyle r{\dot {\theta }}^{2}}
is "centrifugal force", and reinterpret






r
¨





{\displaystyle {\ddot {r}}}
as "acceleration", the oddity results in frame S' that straight-line motion at constant speed requires a net force in polar coordinates, but not in Cartesian coordinates. Moreover, this perplexity applies in frame S', but not in frame S.
The absurdity of the behavior of

{\displaystyle r{\dot {\theta }}^{2}}
indicates that one must say that



r

2




{\displaystyle r{\dot {\theta }}^{2}}
is not centrifugal force, but simply one of two terms in the acceleration. This view, that the acceleration is composed of two terms, is frame-independent: there is zero centrifugal force in any and every inertial frame. It also is coordinate-system independent: we can use Cartesian, polar, or any other curvilinear system: they all produce zero.
Apart from the above physical arguments, of course, the derivation above, based upon application of the mathematical rules of differentiation, shows the radial acceleration does indeed consist of the two terms

That said, the next subsection shows there is a connection between these centrifugal and Coriolis terms and the fictitious forces that pertain to a particular rotating frame of reference (as distinct from an inertial frame).
