Bradyarrhythmias
Bradyarrhythmias  are  deﬁned  as  heart  rates  that  are  abnormally  slow  (<60  b.p.m.)  [Katz,  1992].  They  are
generally caused by either sinus node disease or AV conduction disorders. In the former, disease of the body’s
natural pacemaker cells often results in an unnaturally slow heart rate and signiﬁcant patient discomfort. Also,
the heart rate may not increase in response to exercise due to a loss of neural control of the sinus node, which
will inhibit the patient from performing strenuous activities; this is known as chronotropic incompetence. AV
conduction disease results from a pathology of the cells that electrically connect the atria and the ventricles.
This can result in inefﬁcient blood delivery due to a loss of AV synchrony. Pacemakers are commonly used to
attempt to restore a natural heart rate, AV synchrony, and chronotropic competence in patients with these and
other diseases. Approximately 115,000 pacemakers are implanted in the U.S. every year [Ellenbogen, 1996].
