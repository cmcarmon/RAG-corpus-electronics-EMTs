(cid:1) The first-order differential equations that result from applying KVL and
KCL to networks containing sources, resistors, and one energy-storage
element can be derived using the node method or the other approaches
described in Chapter 3. These differential equations can be solved by finding
the homogeneous solution and the particular solution.
