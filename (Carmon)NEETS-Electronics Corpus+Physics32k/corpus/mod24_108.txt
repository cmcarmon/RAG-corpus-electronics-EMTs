A light ray is reflected and refracted when it encounters the boundary between two different
transparent mediums. For example, figure 2-7 shows what happens to the light ray when it encounters the
interface between glass and air. The index of refraction for glass (n1) is 1.50. The index of refraction for
air (n2) is 1.00.
