Even for the non-ideal case, where the electric conductivity is not infinite, a similar result can be obtained by defining the magnetic flux transporting velocity by writing

,


{\displaystyle {\vec {\nabla }}\times ({\vec {w}}\times {\vec {B}})=\eta {\vec {\nabla }}^{2}{\vec {B}}+{\vec {\nabla }}\times ({\vec {v}}\times {\vec {B}}),}

where instead of fluid velocity,



v


{\displaystyle v}
, the flux velocity



w


{\displaystyle w}
has been used. Although, in some cases, this velocity field can be found using magnetohydrodynamic equations, but the existence and uniqueness of this vector field depends on the underlying conditions.
