But the Fourier series goes well beyond being another signal decomposition method. Rather, the Fourier
series begins our journey to appreciate how a signal can be described in either the time-domain or the
frequency-domain with no compromise. Let s (t) be a periodic signal with period T . We want to show
that periodic signals, even those that have constant-valued segments like a square wave, can be expressed
