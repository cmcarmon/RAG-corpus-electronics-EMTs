 The third factor that affects the inductance of a coil is the length of the coil. Figure 2-7 shows two 
examples of coil spacings. Coil (A) has three turns, rather widely spaced, making a relatively long coil. A 
coil of this type has few flux linkages, due to the greater distance between each turn. Therefore, coil (A) 
has a relatively low inductance. Coil (B) has closely spaced turns, making a relatively short coil. This 
close spacing increases the flux linkage, increasing the inductance of the coil. Doubling the length of a 
coil while keeping the same number of turns halves the value of inductance.
