shown in Figure 3.4.1, the voltage transfer function ¯Vout/ ¯Vin is given by
(cid:2)
¯H (j ω) = ¯Vout¯Vin
1 + (ωRC)2
√
where H(ω) is the amplitude ratio and θ (ω) is the phase shift. Deﬁning the cutoff frequency as
2, or 0.707 of its maximum value (which is 1.0
the frequency ω at which H (ω) is reduced to 1/
at ω = 0), it follows that
