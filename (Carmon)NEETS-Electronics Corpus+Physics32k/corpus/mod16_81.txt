properly perform its designed functions. Rough handling, excessive heat, moisture, and dust all affect the
useful life of the equipment. Bumping or dropping a test instrument may ruin the calibration of a meter,
cause short circuits, or damage electronic elements inside the case. Sharp bends, creases, or dents in
coaxial test cables can alter the expected attenuating effect and cause false meter readings or
measurements. Forced air cooling, dust filters, and heaters are used in many pieces of equipment. This
test equipment requires clean air filters for proper ventilation and a warm-up period that permits units in
the equipment to maintain calibrated standards.
