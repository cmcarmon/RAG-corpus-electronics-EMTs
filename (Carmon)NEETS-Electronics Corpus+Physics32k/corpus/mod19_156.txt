When you use the term decibel (dB), you are referring to a logarithmic comparison between two 
signals, usually the output and the input. In power measurement applications, however, a reference of 0 
dBm equalling 1 milliwatt is usually used. The term dBm is used to represent power levels above, below, 
or at 1 milliwatt.
