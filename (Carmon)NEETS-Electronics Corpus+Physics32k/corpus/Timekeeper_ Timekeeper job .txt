In the case of a job occupation, the timekeeper is a person who measures time with the assistance of a clock or stopwatch. In addition, the timekeeper records time, time taken, or time remaining during events such as sports matches.
It is also the timekeeper's job to make sure that meetings don't run on too late and make sure there is enough time to talk about everything on the agenda.
