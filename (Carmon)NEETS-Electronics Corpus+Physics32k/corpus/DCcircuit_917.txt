Such a device is called a strain gauge. Strain gauges are frequently used in mechanical
engineering research and development to measure the stresses generated by machinery. Air-
craft component testing is one area of application, tiny strain-gauge strips glued to structural
members, linkages, and any other critical component of an airframe to measure stress. Most
strain gauges are smaller than a postage stamp, and they look something like this:
