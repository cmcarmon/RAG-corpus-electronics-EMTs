Measures of the Steady-State Response
In the steady state, the accuracy of the time response is an indication of how well the dynamic response follows
a  desired  time  trajectory.  Usually  a  test  signal  (reference  signal)  is  selected  to  measure  accuracy.  Consider
Fig. 100.5. In this conÔ¨Åguration, the objective is to force y(t) to track a reference signal r(t) as close as possible.
