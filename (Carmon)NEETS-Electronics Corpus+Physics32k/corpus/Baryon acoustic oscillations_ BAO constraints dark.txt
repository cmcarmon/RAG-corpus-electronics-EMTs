The BAO in the radial and tangential directions provide measurements of the Hubble parameter and angular diameter distance, respectively. The angular diameter distance and Hubble parameter can include different functions that explain dark energy behavior. These functions have two parameters w0 and w1 and one can constrain them with chi-square technique.
