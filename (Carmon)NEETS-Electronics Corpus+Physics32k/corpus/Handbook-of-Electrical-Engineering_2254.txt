Nanostructure Engineering
Epitaxial growth techniques, especially molecular beam epitaxy and metal-organic chemical vapor deposition,
allow monolayer control in the chemical composition process. Both single thin layers and superlattices can be
obtained  by  such  methods.  The  electronic  properties  of  these  structures  are  of  interest  for  potential  device
applications. In a single quantum well, electrons are bound in the conﬁning well potential. For example, in a
rectangular quantum well of width b and inﬁnite walls, the allowed energy levels are
