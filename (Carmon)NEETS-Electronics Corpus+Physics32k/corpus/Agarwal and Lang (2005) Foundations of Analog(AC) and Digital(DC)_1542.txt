c) Write an expression for the rise time of the buffer for the circuit configuration shown
in Figure 10.94c. (Hint: Refer to the sketch of vC from part (b.) The rise time of the
buffer is the time vC requires to transition from the lowest voltage reached by vC to
VH from the time the input vA makes a step transition from 0 V to VS. Note that
the rise time of the buffer includes the internal buffer fall delay, which is the time
vB takes to transition from VS to VT, and the additional time vC takes to transition
from its lowest voltage to VH.)
