WIM systems can employ various types of sensors for measurement. The most important quantity to measure is the vertical force (z component) without any influence of forces in other directions or speed of the vehicle that passes by. Force sensors with quartz crystals are the most rigid and measure only in one direction along the vertical axis. When a force is applied to the top surface of the sensor, quartz crystals produce an electric charge proportional to the applied force. The signal is a very high impedance electric charge, which is not susceptible to electrical interference.
