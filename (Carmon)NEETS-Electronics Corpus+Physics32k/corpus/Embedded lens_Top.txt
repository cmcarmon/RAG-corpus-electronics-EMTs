An embedded lens is a gravitational lens such that the mass of the lens is a part of the mean mass density of the background universe and not simply superimposed upon it as is done in the standard gravitational lensing theory.
For a homogeneous background Universe, a spherical sphere is removed and a lens of mass equal to the removed dust sphere is placed at the center of the void. The mass condensation can be either a point mass or distributed mass, but should be spherically symmetric with respect to the center of the void. If the background universe also contains a non-vanishing cosmological constant Λ, then Λ is required to be the same inside and outside of the void. The metric describing the geometry within the void can be Schwarzschild or Kottler depending on whether there is a non-zero cosmological constant.
Embedding a lens effectively reduces the gravitational potential's range, i.e., partially shields the lensing potential produced by the lens mass condensation. For example, a light ray grazing the boundary of a Kottler/Schwarzschild void will not be bended by the lens mass condensation (i.e., does not feel the gravitational potential of the embedded lens) and travels along a straight line path in a flat background universe.
