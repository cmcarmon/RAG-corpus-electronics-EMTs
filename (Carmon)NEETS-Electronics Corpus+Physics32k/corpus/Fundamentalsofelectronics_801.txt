6.12 Signal-to-Noise Ratio of an Amplitude-Modulated Signal14
When we consider the much more realistic situation when we have a channel that introduces attenuation
and noise, we can make use of the just-described receiver’s linear nature to directly derive the receiver’s
output. The attenuation aﬀects the output in the same way as the transmitted signal: It scales the output
signal by the same amount. The white noise, on the other hand, should be ﬁltered from the received signal
before demodulation. We must thus insert a bandpass ﬁlter having bandwidth 2W and center frequency fc:
This ﬁlter has no eﬀect on the received signal-related component, but does remove out-of-band noise power.
As shown in the triangular-shaped signal spectrum (Figure 6.6), we apply coherent receiver to this ﬁltered
signal, with the result that the demodulated output contains noise that cannot be removed: It lies in the
same spectral band as the signal.
