Actually, developing this skill under this constraint is not as difﬁ-
cult  as  it  seems.  What  you  need  to  do  is  to  take  the  experiment  and
analyze it. Just break it down into its simplest parts, reconstruct it try-
ing  to  understand  why  each  element  is  there,  and  ﬁnally,  determine
what the author of the experiment is trying to teach you. Even though
it may not always seem so, every experiment you do was designed by
someone who was sincerely motivated to teach you something.
