Bear in mind that this is a ”best case” scenario (clean, dry skin) from the standpoint of
electrical safety, and that this ﬁgure for voltage represents the amount necessary to induce
tetanus. Far less would be required to cause a painful shock! Also keep in mind that the
physiological effects of any particular amount of current can vary signiﬁcantly from person to
person, and that these calculations are rough estimates only.
