Many scientific laws are couched in mathematical terms (e.g. Newton's Second law F = ​dp⁄dt, or the uncertainty principle, or the principle of least action, or causality). While these scientific laws explain what our senses perceive, they are still empirical, and so are not "mathematical" laws. (Mathematical laws can be proved purely by mathematics and not by scientific experiment.)
