TA	=	RA	+	AA
When	talking	about	a	multimeter’s	resolution	and	accuracy,	input	impedance	is	a
set	of	terms	that	needs	to	be	acknowledged,	too.	This	is	due	to	the	device’s
inability	to	achieve	accurate	readings	when	it	is	not	set	accordingly.	Especially	for
the	measurement	of	a	circuit’s	voltage,	its	input	impedance	has	to	be	calibrated
high	(i.e.	higher	than	a	circuit’s	voltage)	so	the	operation	remains	smoothly.
