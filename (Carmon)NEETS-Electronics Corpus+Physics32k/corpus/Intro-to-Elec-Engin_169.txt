STEP 2: Identify the nodes and choose a convenient reference node O. This is also shown in
Figure E2.2.1(b).
STEP 3: In terms of unknown node-voltage variables, write the KCL equations at all nodes
(except, of course, the reference node) by following rules 1 and 2 for nodal equations given in
this section.
