Changing the value of resistance or capacitance in the circuit also affects linearity. If the value of C2 
or R3 is increased, the time is increased for 1 time constant. An increase in the time for 1TC results in a 
decrease in the number of time constants required for good linearity. As stated earlier, a decrease in the 
number of time constants results in an increase in linearity (less than 0.1TC). In addition to an increase in 
jump voltage (larger value of R3) and a decrease in the amplitude (physical length) of the sawtooth 
produced by the circuit, electrical length remains the same because the length of the gate was not 
changed.
