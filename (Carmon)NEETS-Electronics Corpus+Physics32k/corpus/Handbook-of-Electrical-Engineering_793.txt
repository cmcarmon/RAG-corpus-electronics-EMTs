This  deﬁnition  relates  to  transfer  functions  which  are  ratios  of  voltages  and/or  currents.  The  decibel  gain
 has a multiplying factor of 10 rather than 20. This method of plotting frequency response
between two 
information was popularized by H.W. Bode in the 1930s. There are two main advantages of the Bode approach.
The ﬁrst is that, with it, the gain and phase curves can be easily and accurately drawn. Second, once drawn,
features of the curves can be identiﬁed both qualitatively and quantitatively with relative ease, even when those
features occur over a wide dynamic range. Digital computers have rendered the ﬁrst advantage obsolete. Ease
of interpretation, however, remains a powerful advantage, and the Bode diagram is today the most common
method chosen for the display of frequency response data.
