(cid:1) The Thévenin equivalent circuit for any linear network at a given pair of ter-
minals consists of a voltage source in series with a resistor. The element
value for the Thévenin equivalent voltage source can be found by calculat-
ing or measuring at the designated terminal pair on the original network the
open-circuit voltage. The equivalent resistance can be calculated or mea-
sured as the resistance of the network seen from the designated terminal
pair with all independent sources internal to the network set to zero.
