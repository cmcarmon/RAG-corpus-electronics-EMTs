OPTOELECTRONIC DEVICES are of two basic types: light producers or light users. The LED is 
the most widely used light-producing device. When the LED is forward biased it emits energy in the form 
of light. LEDs are used in several configurations as digital equipment readout displays. The 
PHOTODIODE, the PHOTOTRANSISTOR, and the PHOTOCELL are all devices that use light to 
modify conduction through them. The SOLAR CELL uses light to produce voltage.
