At this point you are probably wondering why it is that we were able to
adopt such a sequential approach to analyzing the circuit in Figure 2.67. The
same sequential approach does not work for the circuit in Figure 2.46. The
intuition behind this useful property is that our idealized dependent source has
decoupled the circuit into two parts
an input part and an output part. Because
our dependent source model has an open circuit at its terminals marked by the
branch voltage vIN, the behavior of the input part is completely independent
of the output part of the circuit. In other words, in determining the behavior
of the input part,
it is as if the output did not even exist. The output part,
however, does depend on one of the input variables, namely, vIN. However,
once the value of the control input vIN is determined through an analysis of
the input part, it fixes the value of the dependent source. Thus, the dependent
source can be treated as an independent source for the purpose of analyzing the
output part.
