Although many variations are used, the simplified step-by-step transmission system shown in figure
4-3 is typical. In this system, a step transmitter and a step motor are used together to transmit angular data
(information) between remote locations. When rotated, the shaft of the step transmitter periodically
switches a dc excitation voltage from one pair of coils to another in the step motor. The step motor, which
is the receiver in the system, responds to this varying excitation by rotating an amount that is proportional
to the transmitterâ€™s shaft position.
