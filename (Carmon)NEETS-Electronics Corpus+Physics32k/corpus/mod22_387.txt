Another way to design the primary storage section is to store a single character, such as the letter L 
or the number 8, in each address location. An address is assigned to each location in storage. Computers 
designed in this way are said to be character-oriented or character addressable. We also call them 
variable-word-length computers. Therefore, the name CHARLIE (fig. 4-9, view B) now requires seven 
address locations (300 through 306), while amount paid ($69.00) occupies six address locations (307 
through 312).
