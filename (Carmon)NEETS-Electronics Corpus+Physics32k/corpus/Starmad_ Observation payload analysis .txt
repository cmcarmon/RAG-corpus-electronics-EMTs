It is subdivided in the sections:
Electromagnetic Spectrum & Optics, where typical EM Spectrum and Optics parameters are determined, such as irradiance, emittance, swath-width, ground resolution.
Observation Payload Sizing, where sizing of the observation instrument in terms of dimensions, mass and power is evaluated, as well as the payload data rate.
