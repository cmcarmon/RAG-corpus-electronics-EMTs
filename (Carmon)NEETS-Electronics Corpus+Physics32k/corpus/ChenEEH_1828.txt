MPLS uses the concept of forward equivalence class (FEC)
to provide differential treatment to different media types. A
group of packets that are forwarded in the same manner are
said to belong to the same FEC. There is no limit to the
number and granularity of FECs that can exists. Thus, it is
possible to deﬁne a separate FEC for every ﬂow (which is not
advisable due to large overheads) or for every media type, each
tailored for that media type. One important thing to note here
is that labels have only local signiﬁcance in the sense that two
LSRs agree to use a particular label to signify a particular FEC
among themselves. The same label can be used to distinguish a
different FEC by another pair of LSRs. Thus,
it becomes
necessary to do label assignments, which includes label alloca-
tion and label-to-FEC bindings on every hop of the LSP before
the trafﬁc ﬂow can use the LSP. Label assignments can be
initiated in one of the following three ways:
