Finally,  and  just  in  case  you  haven’t  seen  them 
before, we  will end this chapter  with a brief  word 
about  circuit  diagrams.  We  are  introducing  the 
topic here because it’s quite important to be able to 
read  and  understand  simple  electronic  circuit 
diagrams before you can make sense of some of the 
components and circuits that you will meet later on.  
  Circuit  diagrams  use  standard  symbols  and 
conventions 
the  components  and 
wiring used in an electronic circuit. Visually, they 
bear very little relationship to the physical layout of 
a circuit  but,  instead,  they  provide  us  with  a 
‘theoretical’ view of the circuit. In this section we 
show  you  how  to  find  your  way  round  simple 
circuit diagrams. 
  To be able to understand a circuit diagram you 
first need to be  familiar  with the  symbols  that are 
used  to  represent  the  components  and  devices.  A 
selection  of  some  of  the  most  commonly  used 
symbols are shown in Fig. 1.24. It’s important to be 
aware that there are a few (thankfully quite small) 
differences  between  the  symbols  used  in  circuit 
diagrams of American and European origin.  
  As a general rule, the input to a circuit should be 
shown  on  the  left  of  a  circuit  diagram  and  the 
output shown on the right. The supply (usually the 
most positive voltage) is normally shown at the top 
of  the  diagram  and  the  common,  0V,  or  ground 
connection  is  normally  shown  at  the  bottom.  This 
rule is not always obeyed, particularly for complex 
diagrams  where  many  signals  and  supply  voltages 
may be present.  
  Note  also  that,  in  order  to  simplify  a  circuit 
diagram 
lines 
connected to the same point)  multiple connections 
to common, 0V, or ground may be shown using the 
appropriate  symbol  (see  Fig.  1.24).  The  same 
applies to supply connections that may be repeated 
(appropriately  labelled)  at  various  points  in  the 
diagram.
