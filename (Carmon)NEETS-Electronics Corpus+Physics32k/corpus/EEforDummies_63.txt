A typical refrigerator draws about 3–5 amps of current, and a toaster draws 
roughly 9 amps. That’s a whole lot of electrons at once, much more than are 
typically found in electronic circuits, where you’re more likely to see current 
measured in milliamps (abbreviated mA). A milliamp is one one‐thousandth 
of an amp, or 0.001 amp. (In scientific notation, a milliamp is 1 x 10‐3 amp.)
