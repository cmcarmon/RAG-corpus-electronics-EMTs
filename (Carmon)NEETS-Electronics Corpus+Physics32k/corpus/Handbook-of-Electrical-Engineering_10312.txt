Over the past two decades, there has been active work in the area of low earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems.
In general, LEOs are designed to provide a full range of communication services, both voice and data. Proposed
systems  are  designed  to  complement  existing  cellular  communications  technology.  Several  companies  have
proposed LEO systems and have made application to the FCC for a “Pioneer’s Preference” license. This license
allows  the  use  of  new  and  innovative  technology.  Motorola’s  Iridium  system  is  potentially  the  largest,  using
66 satellites to provide coverage over the entire globe.
