White, Gaussian, and Pink Noise Models
White noise [see Brown, 1983; Gardner, 1990, p. 234; or Peebles, 1987] is a theoretical model W(t) of noise that
is ws with zero mean. It has a constant power level no over all frequencies (analogous to white light), so its psdf
is SWW(w) = no W/(rad/s), –‘ < w < ‘. The inverse Fourier transform of this is the impulse function RWW(t) =
(no)d(t), which is zero for all offsets except t = 0. Therefore, white noise W(t) is a process that is uncorrelated
over time, i.e.,  E[W(t1)W(t2)] = 0 for t1 not equal to t2. Figure 73.4(a) shows the autocorrelation and psdf for
white noise where the offset is s = t. A Gaussian white noise is white noise such that the probability distribution
of each random variable Wt = W(t) is Gaussian. When two Gaussian random variables W1 and W2 are uncor-
related, i.e., E[W1W2] = 0, they are independent [see Gardner, 1990, p. 37]. We use Gaussian models because
of the central limit theorem that states that the sum of a number of random variables is approximately Gaussian.
Actual circuits attenuate signals above cut-off frequencies, and also the power must be ﬁnite. However, for
white noise, PWW = RNN(0) = ‘, so we often truncate the white noise spectral density (psdf) at cut-offs –wc to
wc . The result is known as pink noise, P(t), and is usually taken to be Gaussian because linear ﬁltering of any
white noise (through the effect of the central limit theorem) tends to make the noise Gaussian [see Gardner,
