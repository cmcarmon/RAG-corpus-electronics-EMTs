Passive circuits always consist of uniform sections of transmis-
sion lines interconnected by discontinuities (i.e., impedance
steps). Transmission-line discontinuities can also appear as
gaps, transmission line bends, waveguide apertures, and posts.
The discussed short and open stubs may be regarded as part
of the circuit discontinuities. Generally, discontinuities are
