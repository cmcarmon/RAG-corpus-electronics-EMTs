Computers in Power Systems
The control and stability of any electric power system is indeed extremely important, in particular
when a system is expected to maintain uninterrupted continuity of service within set limits
of frequency and voltage, and to guarantee reliability of the system. Digital computers and
microprocessors, along with highly developed software programs, have made their way into
planning, designing, operating, and maintaining complex interconnected power systems. A large
volume of network data must also be acquired and accurately processed. Digital computer
programs in power-system engineering include power-ï¬‚ow, stability, short-circuit, and transients
programs.
