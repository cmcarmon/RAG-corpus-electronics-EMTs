Electroacoustic Smart Sensors
Electroacoustic  smart  sensors  are  embedded  acoustic  (vibration)  sensors  (similiar  to  a  microphone)  that
adaptively  yield  a  signal  proportional  to  the  acoustic  input.  Such  inputs  could  result  from  changes  in  the
alterations in the surroundings caused by elastic or thermal effects.
