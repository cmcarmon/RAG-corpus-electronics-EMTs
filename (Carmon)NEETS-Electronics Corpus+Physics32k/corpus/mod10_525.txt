A resonant line has a finite length and is not terminated in its characteristic impedance. Therefore
reflections of energy do occur. The load impedance is different from the Z0 of the line; therefore, the input
impedance may not be purely resistive but may have reactive components. Tuning devices are used to
eliminate the reactance and to bring about maximum power transfer from the source to the line.
Therefore, a resonant line is sometimes called a TUNED line. The line also may be used for a resonant or
tuned circuit.
