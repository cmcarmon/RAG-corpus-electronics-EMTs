The pin count of the VLSI circuits in the 1980s 
 exceeded the practical limits for DIP packaging. This 
led to pin	grid	array	(Pga) and leadless	chip	
carrier	(Lcc) packages. Surface-mount packaging, 
which uses a fine lead pitch, became popular in the 
late 1980s. In the late 1990s, high pin count devices 
used plastic	quad	flat	package	(PQFP) and thin	
small	outline	package	(tsoP) packaging.
