(b) Line and phase currents.
(c) Real and reactive powers per phase.
(d) Total three-phase real and reactive powers.
*10.2.7 A three-phase load, connected to a 440-V bus,
draws 120 kW at a power factor of 0.85 lagging.
In parallel with this load is a three-phase capac-
itor bank that is rated 50 kVAR . Determine the
resultant line current and power factor.
