Examination of a discrete-time signal’s plot, like that of the cosine signal shown in Figure 5.7, reveals that
all signals consist of a sequence of delayed and scaled unit samples. Because the value of a sequence at
each integer m is denoted by s (m) and the unit sample delayed to occur at m is written δ (n − m), we can
decompose any signal as a sum of unit samples delayed to the appropriate location and scaled by the signal
value.
