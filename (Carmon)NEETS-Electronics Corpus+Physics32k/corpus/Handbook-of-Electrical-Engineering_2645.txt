A measure of the range of inï¬‚uence of the source and drain is the depletion-layer width of the associated
pn junctions. The depletion layer of such a junction is the region in which all carriers have been depleted, or
pushed away, due to the potential drop across the junction. This potential drop includes the applied bias across
the junction and a spontaneous built-in potential drop induced by spontaneous charge exchange when p and
n regions are brought into contact. The depletion-layer width W of an abrupt junction is related to potential
drop V and dopant-ion concentration/unit volume N by
