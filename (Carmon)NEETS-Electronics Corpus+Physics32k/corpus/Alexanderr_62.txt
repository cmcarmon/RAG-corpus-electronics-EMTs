It  should  be  pointed  out  that  not  all  resistors  obey  Ohm’s  law. A
resistor  that  obeys  Ohm’s  law  is  known  as  a  linear resistor.  It  has  a
constant resistance and thus its current-voltage characteristic is as illus-
trated in Fig. 2.7(a): Its i-v graph is a straight line passing through the
origin.  A nonlinear resistor  does  not  obey  Ohm’s  law.  Its  resistance
varies  with  current  and  its  i-v characteristic  is  typically  shown  in
Fig. 2.7(b). Examples of devices with nonlinear resistance are the light
bulb and the diode. Although all practical resistors may exhibit nonlin-
ear behavior under certain conditions, we will assume in this book that
all elements actually designated as resistors are linear.
