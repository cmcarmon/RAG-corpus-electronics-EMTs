L–C–R circuits 
 
Two  forms  of  L–C–R  network  are  illustrated  in 
Figs  4.15  and  4.16;  Fig.  4.15  is  series  resonant 
while Fig. 4.16 is parallel resonant. As in the case 
of their simpler L–C counterparts, the impedance of 
each  circuit  varies  in  a  complex  manner  with 
frequency. 
  The impedance of the series circuit of Fig. 4.15 
is given by:
