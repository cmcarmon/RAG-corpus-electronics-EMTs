The GAIN of a radar receiver must be very high. This is because the strength of the signal at the
antenna is at a level of microvolts and the required output to the indicator is several volts. The gain of a
radar receiver is roughly in the range of 106 to 10 8. FEEDBACK, or REGENERATION, is one of the
most serious difficulties in the design of an amplifier with such high gain. Special precautions must be
taken to avoid feedback. Such precautions include careful shielding, decoupling (isolation) between
voltage supplies for the different tubes, and amplification at different frequencies in separate groups of
stages.
