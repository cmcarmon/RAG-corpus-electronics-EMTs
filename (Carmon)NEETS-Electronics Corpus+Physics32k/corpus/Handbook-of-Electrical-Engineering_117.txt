Q
Q  is  the  ratio  of  the  inductive  reactance  to  the  internal  resistance  of  the  coil  and  is  affected  by  frequency,
inductance,  dc  resistance,  inductive  reactance,  the  type  of  winding,  the  core  losses,  the  distributed  capacity,
and the permeability of the core material.
