consisting of circuit 1 connected to another circuit, circuit 3, at
the speciﬁed terminals as shown in Figure 1.11(A). The volt-
ages and currents in circuit 3 are not altered if circuit 2 replaces
circuit 1, as shown in Figure 1.11(B). If circuit 2 is simpler
than circuit 1, then the analysis of the composite circuit will
be simpliﬁed. A number of techniques for obtaining two-
terminal equivalent circuits are outlined in the following
section.
