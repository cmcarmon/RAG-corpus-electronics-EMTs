to four times the size for a given amount of data than DRAM.
Moreover, SRAM also consumes more power. SRAM is mainly
used in the implementations of level 1 and level 2 caches.
Typical capacity of SRAM is from a few kilobytes to 1 MB. In
1998, however, IBM announced the high-performance and
high-capacity SRAM that has the capacity of 8 MB and the
speed of up to 600 MHz (see Figure 1.3).
