Radio waves are often referred to by their wavelength in meters rather than by frequency. For 
example, most people have heard commercial radio stations make announcements similar to the 
following: "Station WXYZ operating on 240 meters..." To tune receiving equipment that is calibrated by 
frequency to such a station, you must first convert the designated wavelength to its equivalent frequency.
