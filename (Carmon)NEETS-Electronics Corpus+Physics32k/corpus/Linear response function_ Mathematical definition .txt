Denote the input of a system by



h
(
t
)


{\displaystyle h(t)}
(e.g. a force), and the response of the system by



x
(
t
)


{\displaystyle x(t)}
(e.g. a position). Generally, the value of



x
(
t
)


{\displaystyle x(t)}
will depend not only on the present value of



h
(
t
)


{\displaystyle h(t)}
, but also on past values. Approximately



x
(
t
)


{\displaystyle x(t)}
is a weighted sum of the previous values of



h
(

t
′

)


{\displaystyle h(t')}
, with the weights given by the linear response function

The explicit term on the right-hand side is the leading order term of a Volterra expansion for the full nonlinear response. If the system in question is highly non-linear, higher order terms in the expansion, denoted by the dots, become important and the signal transducer cannot adequately be described just by its linear response function.
