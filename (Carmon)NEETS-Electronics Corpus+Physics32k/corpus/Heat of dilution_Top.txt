The heat of dilution, or enthalpy of dilution, refers to the enthalpy change associated with the dilution process of a component in a solution at a constant pressure. If the initial state of the component is a pure liquid (presuming the solution is liquid), the dilution process is equal to its dissolution process and the heat of dilution is the same as the heat of solution. Generally, the heat of dilution is normalized by the mole number of the solution and its dimension is energy per unit mass, commonly expressed in the unit of kJ/mol (or J/mol).
