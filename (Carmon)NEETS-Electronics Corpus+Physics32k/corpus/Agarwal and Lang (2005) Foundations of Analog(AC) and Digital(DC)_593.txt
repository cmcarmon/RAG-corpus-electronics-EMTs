When we reconnect the nonlinear device to this Th√©venin circuit, as in Figure 4.13e,
we are back to a familiar example: one nonlinear device, one source, and one resistor.
The desired device current iD can be found by a nonlinear analysis method, such as that
used to solve the circuit in Figure 4.9.
