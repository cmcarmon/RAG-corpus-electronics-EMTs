The relative motion between a droplet and the gas results in an increase of the heat and mass transfer rates in the gas film surrounding the droplet. A convective boundary layer and a wake can surround the droplet. Furthermore, the shear force on the liquid surface causes an internal circulation that enhances the heating of the liquid. As a consequence, the vaporization rate increases with the droplet Reynolds number. Many different models exist for the single convective droplet vaporization case. Vaporizing droplet models can be seen to belong to six different classes:
Constant droplet temperature model (d2-law)
Infinite liquid conductivity model
Spherically symmetric transient droplet heating model
Effective conductivity model
Vortex model of droplet heating
Navier-Stokes solution
The main difference between all these models is the treatment of the heating of the liquid phase which is usually the rate controlling phenomenon in droplet vaporization . The first three models do not consider internal liquid circulation. The effective conductivity model (4) and the vortex model of droplet heating (5) account for internal circulation and internal convective heating. The direct resolution of the Navier-Stokes equations provide, in principle, exact solutions both for the gas phase and the liquid phase.
It is interesting to note that model (1) is a simplification of model (2) which is in turn a simplification of model (3). The spherically symmetric transient droplet heating model (3) solves the equation for heat diffusion through the liquid phase. A droplet heating time τh can be defined as the time required for a thermal diffusion wave to penetrate from the droplet surface to its center. The droplet heating time is compared to the droplet lifetime, τl. If the droplet heating time is short compared to the droplet lifetime we can assume that the temperature field inside the droplet is uniform and model (2) is obtained. In the infinite liquid conductivity model (2) the temperature of the droplet is uniform but varies with time. It is possible to go one step further and find the conditions for which we can neglect the temporal variation of the droplet temperature. The liquid temperature varies in time until the wet-bulb temperature is reached. If the wet-bulb temperature is reached in a time of the same order of magnitude than the droplet heating time then the liquid temperature can be considered to be constant with regards to time. Model (1), the d2-law, is obtained.
The infinite liquid conductivity model is widely used in industrial spray calculations:  for its balance between computational costs and accuracy. To account for the convective effects which enhanced the heat and mass transfer rates around the droplet, a correction is applied to the spherically symmetric expressions of the Sherwood and Nusselt numbers
