A closed ecosystem can be thought of as a mass balance between the major elements which are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur and phosphorus (CHONSP) which alone represent 95% of the mass to recycle. The conversion of waste elements to resources, which can be used by crewmembers can be achieved by two means: physiochemically or biologically. Physiochemical processes such as the Sabatier reaction would result in high efficiencies however a large amount of energy is required in terms of temperature and pressure. Whereas biologically, using photosynthesis, efficiencies are lower, however ambient temperatures and pressures can be used. Photosynthesis is the process whereby plants convert light energy into chemical energy of sugars and other organic compounds. The chemical reactions utilise carbon and water with the by-product of oxygen, released into the atmosphere. MELiSSA is partly based on these photosynthetic reactions: recycling carbon dioxide into oxygen. Higher plants (wheat, rice, salad) would be utilised to produce food for the crewmembers. Photosynthetic micro-organisms would also be used to transform carbon dioxide into oxygen with the possibility of using the micro-organism of choice as part of the food intake, as an essential protein resource.
