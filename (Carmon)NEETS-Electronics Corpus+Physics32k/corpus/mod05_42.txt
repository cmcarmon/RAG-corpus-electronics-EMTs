Extend the thumb, forefinger, and middle finger of your left hand at right angles to one another, as 
shown in figure 1-1. Point your thumb in the direction the conductor is being moved. Point your 
forefinger in the direction of magnetic flux (from north to south). Your middle finger will then point in 
the direction of current flow in an external circuit to which the voltage is applied.
