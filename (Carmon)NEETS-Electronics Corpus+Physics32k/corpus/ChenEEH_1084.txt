The sequential steps common to making many engineered
components also apply to MEMS: design, simulation, fabri-
cation, packaging, and testing. Figure 6.3 shows
these
steps. The results of these actions determine both the perform-
ance and the price of devices like integrated circuits and
MEMS as well as their reliability. Hence, they are considered
a necessary prelude to understanding practical applications
of MEMS.
