Heart rate reserve (HRreserve) is the difference between a person's measured or predicted maximum heart rate and resting heart rate. Some methods of measurement of exercise intensity measure percentage of heart rate reserve. Additionally, as a person increases their cardiovascular fitness, their HRrest will drop, and the heart rate reserve will increase. Percentage of HRreserve is equivalent to percentage of VO2 reserve.
HRreserve = HRmax âˆ’ HRrest
This is often used to gauge exercise intensity (first used in 1957 by Karvonen).
Karvonen's study findings have been questioned, due to the following:
The study did not use VO2 data to develop the equation.
Only six subjects were used, and the correlation between the percentages of HRreserve and VO2 max was not statistically significant.
