One application of a counter is frequency divi-
sion. A single flip-flop produces an output pulse for 
every two input pulses. Therefore, it is essentially a 
divide-by-two device with an output one-half the 
frequency of the input. A two-stage binary counter is 
a divide-by-four device with an output equal to one-
fourth the input clock frequency. A four-stage binary
