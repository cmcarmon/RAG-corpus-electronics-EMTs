Scanners: Means for converting hard copy into electrical signals that can be entered into a computer or data
processing system. The usual means for accomplishing such conversion is to move a light beam over the
surface containing the data either by hand or automatically and using arrays of light-sensitive devices to
convert the reï¬‚ected light into electrical pulses.
