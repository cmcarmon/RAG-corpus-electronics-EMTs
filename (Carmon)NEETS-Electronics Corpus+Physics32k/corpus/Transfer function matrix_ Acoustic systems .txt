Acoustic systems are a subset of fluid dynamics, and in both fields the primary input and output variables are pressure, P, and volumetric flow rate, Q, except in the case of sound travelling through solid components. In the latter case, the primary variables of mechanics, force and velocity, are more appropriate. An example of a two-port acoustic component is a filter such as a muffler on an exhaust system. A transfer matrix representation of it may look like,

{\displaystyle {\begin{bmatrix}P_{2}\\Q_{2}\end{bmatrix}}={\begin{bmatrix}T_{11}&T_{12}\\T_{21}&T_{22}\end{bmatrix}}{\begin{bmatrix}P_{1}\\Q_{1}\end{bmatrix}}}

Here, the Tmn are the transmission parameters, also known as ABCD-parameters. The component can be just as easily described by the z-parameters, but transmission parameters have a mathematical advantage when dealing with a system of two-ports that are connected in a cascade of the output of one into the input port of another. In such cases the overall transmission parameters are found simply by the matrix multiplication of the transmission parameter matrices of the constituent components.
