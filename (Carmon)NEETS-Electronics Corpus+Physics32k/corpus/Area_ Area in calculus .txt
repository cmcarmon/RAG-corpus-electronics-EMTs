The area between a positive-valued curve and the horizontal axis, measured between two values a and b (b is defined as the larger of the two values) on the horizontal axis, is given by the integral from a to b of the function that represents the curve:




A
=

∫

a


b


f
(
x
)

d
x
.


{\displaystyle A=\int _{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx.}

The area between the graphs of two functions is equal to the integral of one function, f(x), minus the integral of the other function, g(x):




A

∫

a

{\displaystyle A=\int _{a}^{b}(f(x)-g(x))\,dx,}
where



f

{\displaystyle f(x)}
is the curve with the greater y-value.
An area bounded by a function r = r(θ) expressed in polar coordinates is:
