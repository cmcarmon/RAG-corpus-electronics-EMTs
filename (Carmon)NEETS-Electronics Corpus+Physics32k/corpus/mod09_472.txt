Since Q1 is a pnp transistor, a positive voltage must be used to drive it to cutoff. Figure 3-47, view 
(B), shows a rectangular wave input 500 microseconds long on the positive alternation. At T0, the 
positive gate applied to the base of Q1 cuts off Q1. This effectively removes the transistor from the circuit 
(opens the switch), and C1 charges through R3 toward 20 volts. Starting with a charge of âˆ’2.5 volts at T0, 
C1 charges (T0 to T1) for 500 microseconds to -4.25 volts at T1. Let's determine the percent of charge:
