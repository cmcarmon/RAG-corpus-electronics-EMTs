In a mixture between a dielectric and a metallic component, the conductivity



σ


{\displaystyle \sigma }
and the dielectric constant



ϵ


{\displaystyle \epsilon }
of this mixture show a critical behavior if the fraction of the metallic component reaches the percolation threshold. The behavior of the conductivity near this percolation threshold will show a smooth change over from the conductivity of the dielectric component to the conductivity of the metallic component and can be described using two critical exponents s and t, whereas the dielectric constant will diverge if the threshold is approached from either side. To include the frequency dependent behavior, a resistor-capacitor model (R-C model) is used.
