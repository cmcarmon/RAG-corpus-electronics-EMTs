When noninsulated terminals and splices are used, some form of insulation must be used to cover the 
bare conductor. The two most common forms of insulator used for terminals and splices are transparent 
tubing (commonly called spaghetti) and heat-shrinkable tubing. If spaghetti is used, it must be tied with 
lacing twine, as illustrated in figure 2-13. Heat-shrinkable tubing is shrunk to the desirable size by 
applying dry heat. It is also a good way to insulate terminals and splices, as illustrated in figure 2-14. This 
tubing shrinks to approximately one-half its original diameter when heated with an electrical hot-air gun 
(figure 2-15). Here are the steps for using the hot-air gun:
