conformal coatings are nonconductive materials 
applied in a thin layer on printed circuit boards. They 
provide environmental and mechanical protection to 
significantly extend the life of the components and 
circuitry. Dipping, spraying, or flow coating are tradi-
tional methods for applying conformal coatings.
