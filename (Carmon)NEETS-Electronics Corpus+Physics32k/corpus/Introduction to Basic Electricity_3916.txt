Figure 38-6 shows a simple voltage amplifier. The 
circuit shown is a common-emitter circuit. It is biased 
to operate as a class A amplifier to provide a minimum 
amount of distortion. The amplifier can provide a 
substantial voltage gain over a wide frequency range. 
Because of the coupling capacitors, the circuit cannot 
amplify a DC signal.
