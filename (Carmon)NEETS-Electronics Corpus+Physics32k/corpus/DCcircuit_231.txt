The last line of text in the computer’s analysis report is ”total power dissipation,” which in
this case is given as ”2.00E+01” watts: 2.00 x 101, or 20 watts. SPICE outputs most ﬁgures
in scientiﬁc notation rather than normal (ﬁxed-point) notation. While this may seem to be
more confusing at ﬁrst, it is actually less confusing when very large or very small numbers are
involved. The details of scientiﬁc notation will be covered in the next chapter of this book.
