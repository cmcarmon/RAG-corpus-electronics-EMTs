He then states what he calls the “theorem respecting the equivalence-values of the transformations” or what is now known as the second law of thermodynamics, as such:

Quantitatively, Clausius states the mathematical expression for this theorem is as follows. Let dQ be an element of the heat given up by the body to any reservoir of heat during its own changes, heat which it may absorb from a reservoir being here reckoned as negative, and T the absolute temperature of the body at the moment of giving up this heat, then the equation:




∫



d
Q

T


=
0


{\displaystyle \int {\frac {dQ}{T}}=0}

must be true for every reversible cyclical process, and the relation:




∫

T


≥
0


{\displaystyle \int {\frac {dQ}{T}}\geq 0}

must hold good for every cyclical process which is in any way possible.
