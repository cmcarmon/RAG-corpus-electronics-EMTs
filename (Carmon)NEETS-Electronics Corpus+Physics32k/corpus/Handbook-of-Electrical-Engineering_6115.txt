Often optimal operation conﬂicts with the security requirements of the system. Load ﬂow studies are used
to assess security (security assessment). This can be viewed as two separate functions. First, there is a need to
detect any operating limit violations through continuous monitoring of the branch ﬂows and nodal voltages.
Second, there is a need to determine the effects of branch outages (contingency analysis). To reduce this to a
manageable level, the list of contingencies is reduced by judicial elimination of most of the cases that are not
expected to cause violations. From this the possible overloading of equipment can be forecast. The program
should be designed to accommodate the condition where generation cannot meet the load because of network
islanding.
