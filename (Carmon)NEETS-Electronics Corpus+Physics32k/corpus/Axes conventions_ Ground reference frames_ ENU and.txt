Basically, as lab frame or reference frame, there are two kinds of conventions for the frames (sometimes named LVLH, local vertical, local horizontal):
East, North, Up, referred as ENU
North, East, Down, referred as NED, used specially in aerospace
These frames are location dependent. For movements around the globe, like air or sea navigation, the frames are defined as tangent to the lines of coordinates.
East-West tangent to parallels,
North-South tangent to meridians, and
Up-Down in the direction to the center of the earth (when using a spherical Earth simplification), or in the direction normal to the local tangent plane (using an oblate spheroidal or geodetic ellipsoidal model of the earth) which does not generally pass through the center of the Earth.
