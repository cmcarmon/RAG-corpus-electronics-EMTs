CT Serpentis (also known as Nova Serpentis 1948) was a nova that appeared in the constellation Serpens in 1948. It is thought to have reached magnitude 6.0, but this is an extrapolation of its light curve as it was not observed until 9 April 1948 when it was at magnitude 9.0 and fadingâ€”clearly past its maximum.
