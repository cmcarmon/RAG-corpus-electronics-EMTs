CURRENT MEASUREMENTS are not often taken in the course of testing because the ammeter
(or other current measuring device) must become an actual part of the equipment being tested. The circuit
must be opened for necessary connection of the meter. Usually you can use a voltage measurement to
calculate the circuit current by applying Ohmâ€™s law.
