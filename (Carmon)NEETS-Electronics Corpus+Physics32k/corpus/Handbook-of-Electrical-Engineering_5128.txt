Classically, such intelligent material systems have been conceived in the development of mechanical structures
that contain their own sensors, actuators and self-assessing computational feasibilities in order to modify their
structural (elastic) behavior via feedback control capabilities. The relevant concepts have stemmed from intel-
ligent  forms  of  natural  (material)  systems,  namely,  living  organisms;  hence,  in  modern  concepts  smart  or
