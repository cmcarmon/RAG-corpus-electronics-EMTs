Sensitivity time-control circuits apply a bias voltage that varies with time to the IF amplifiers to
control receiver gain. Figure 2-29 shows a typical stc waveform in relation to the transmitted pulse. When
the transmitter fires, the stc circuit decreases the receiver gain to zero to prevent the amplification of any
leakage energy from the transmitted pulse. At the end of the transmitted pulse, the stc voltage begins to
rise, gradually increasing the receiver gain to maximum. The stc voltage effect on receiver gain is usually
limited to approximately 50 miles. This is because close-in targets are most likely to saturate the receiver;
beyond 50 miles, stc has no affect and the receiver operates normally.
