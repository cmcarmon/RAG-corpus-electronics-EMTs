In  this  section,  attention  will  be  restricted  to  frequency-selective  ﬁlters.  These  ﬁlters  are  intended  to  pass
frequency components of the input sequence in a given band of the spectrum while blocking the rest. Typical
frequency-selective ﬁlter types are low-pass, high-pass, bandpass, and band-reject. Other special-purpose ﬁlters
exist,  but  their  design  is  an  advanced  topic  that  will  not  be  addressed  here.  In  addition,  special  attention  is
given to causal ﬁlters, that is, those for which the impulse response is identically zero for negative n and thus
can  be  realized  in  real  time.  Digital  ﬁlters  are  further  separated  into  two  classes  depending  on  whether  the
impulse response contains a ﬁnite or inﬁnite number of nonzero terms.
