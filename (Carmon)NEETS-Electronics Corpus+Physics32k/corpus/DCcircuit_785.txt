Resistance in ohms, of course, is read by a nonlinear scale at the top of the meter face. It
is ”backward,” just like all battery-operated analog ohmmeters, with zero at the right-hand
side of the face and inﬁnity at the left-hand side. There is only one jack provided on this
particular multimeter for ”ohms,” so different resistance-measuring ranges must be selected
by the rotary switch. Notice on the switch how ﬁve different ”multiplier” settings are provided
for measuring resistance: Rx1, Rx10, Rx100, Rx1000, and Rx10000. Just as you might suspect,
the meter indication is given by multiplying whatever needle position is shown on the meter
face by the power-of-ten multiplying factor set by the rotary switch.
