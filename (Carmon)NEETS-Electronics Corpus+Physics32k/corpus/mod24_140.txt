The TE mode field patterns shown in figure 2-17 indicate the order of each mode. The order of each
mode is indicated by the number of field maxima within the core of the fiber. For example, TE0 has one
field maxima. The electric field is a maximum at the center of the waveguide and decays toward the core-
cladding boundary. TE0 is considered the fundamental mode or the lowest order standing wave. As the
number of field maxima increases, the order of the mode is higher. Generally, modes with more than a
few (5-10) field maxima are referred to as high-order modes.
