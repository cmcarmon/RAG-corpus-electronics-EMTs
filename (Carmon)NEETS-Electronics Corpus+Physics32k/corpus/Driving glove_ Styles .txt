Unlined - The unlined designs allow the fingers senses through, so that drivers do not lose a layer of sensitivity lost with lined gloves.
Lined - Driverâ€™s gloves are frequently used to keep the hands warm, a function that is particularly necessary during top down operation in cold weather. The design of cars is such that the driver's hands remain on the steering wheel while driving, a position that leaves them exposed to the elements. The hands are also relatively inactive, and do not have a great deal of muscle mass, which also contributes to the possibility of chill. Lined gloves therefore contribute to insulating the hands while driving.
Full fingered - Gloves should fit snugly but not be tight. Pay particular attention to the length of the fingers as the fingertips can become very cold if the glove's fingers are not long enough. Ideally the glove should be loose on the fingers and fit comfortably around the palm. A tight glove will tend to restrict blood flow and make the hand cold as it is at an extreme distance from the heart.
Fingerless - Fingerless gloves have the fingers cut off. The exposed fingers interfere less with the sensation of gripping.
