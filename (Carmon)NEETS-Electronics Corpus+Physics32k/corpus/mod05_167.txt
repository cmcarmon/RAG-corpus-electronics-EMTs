A compound motor has two field windings, as shown in figure 2-5. One is a shunt field connected in 
parallel with the armature; the other is a series field that is connected in series with the armature. The 
shunt field gives this type of motor the constant speed advantage of a regular shunt motor. The series field 
gives it the advantage of being able to develop a large torque when the motor is started under a heavy 
load. It should not be a surprise that the compound motor has both shunt- and series-motor characteristics.
