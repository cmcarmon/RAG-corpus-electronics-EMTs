The amount of water (OH�) impurities present in a fiber should be less than a few parts per billion.
Fiber attenuation caused by extrinsic absorption is affected by the level of impurities (OH �) present in the
fiber. If the amount of impurities in a fiber is reduced, then fiber attenuation is reduced.
