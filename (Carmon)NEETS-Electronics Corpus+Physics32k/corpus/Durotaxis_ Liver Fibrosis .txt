Fibrosis of the liver is the accumulation of ECM proteins, such as collagen, that occurs in many chronic liver diseases. Increased liver stiffness (of existing collagen) has actually been shown to precede fibrosis and to be required for the activation of fibrogenic myofibroblasts. Fibroblasts move towards the stiffer tissue via durotaxis, and upon reaching it, will differentiate into fibrogenic myofibroblasts. This vicious positive feedback loop of durotaxis-dependent fibrosis could potentially be a therapeutic target for the prevention of liver fibrosis.
