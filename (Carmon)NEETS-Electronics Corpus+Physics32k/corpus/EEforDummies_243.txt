 current when necessary, and ensure that the correct voltage is supplied to a 
device. For instance, as electrons travel through the filament of an incandes­
cent light bulb, they meet so much resistance that they slow down a lot. As 
they fight their way through the filament, the atoms of the filament bump into 
each other furiously, generating heat — which produces the glow that you 
see from your light bulb.
