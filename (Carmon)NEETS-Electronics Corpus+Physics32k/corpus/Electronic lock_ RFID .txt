Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is the use of an object (typically referred to as an "RFID tag") applied to or incorporated into a product, animal, or person for the purpose of identification and tracking using radio waves. Some tags can be read from several meters away and beyond the line of sight of the reader. This technology is also used in some modern electronic locks.
