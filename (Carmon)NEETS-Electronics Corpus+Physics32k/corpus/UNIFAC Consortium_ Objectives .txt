The normal work of the consortium includes
the creation of new and the improvement of older model parameters
the measurement of experimental data (partly own work, partly given to contractors)
holding annual member meetings
The consortium has e. g. added or modified 404 interaction parameters in the original UNIFAC matrix compared to the 635 parameters from the latest publication.
Interaction parameters of the original UNIFAC model

The major goals are to
improve the quality of the predictions
extend the range of applicability of the models. This include the support for further component types with new functional groups.
supply the parameters to process simulation and DDB software (for consortium members only)
The model parameters are confidential and only accessible to consortium members for at least two and a half year after the first delivery. After this time the university can publish the model parameters.
