The speciÔ¨Åcations of required performance are sometimes
such that it is not possible to build a WD that can fetch all the
required signatures or instructions. For these cases, asynchro-
nous versions have been proposed in past work (Mahmood
and McCluskey, 1988). These solutions make use of a signature
queue allowing an asynchronous checking of the run-time
signatures transferred to the WD.
