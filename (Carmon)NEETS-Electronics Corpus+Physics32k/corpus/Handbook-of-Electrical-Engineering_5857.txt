The input to the machine can be derived from a number of energy sources. For example, in the generation
of large-scale electric power, coal can produce steam that drives the shaft of the machine. Typically, for such a
thermal process, only about 1/3 of the raw energy (i.e., from coal) is converted into mechanical energy. The
ﬁnal step of the energy conversion is quite efﬁcient, with an efﬁciency close to 100%.
