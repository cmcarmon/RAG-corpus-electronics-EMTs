A larger capacitor has a longer RC time constant, 
resulting in a slower discharge of the capacitor and 
thus raising the output voltage. The presence of the  
capacitor allows the diode in the circuit to conduct for 
a shorter period of time. When the diode is not con-
ducting, the capacitor is supplying the current to the 
load. If the current required by the load is large, a very 
large capacitor must be used.
