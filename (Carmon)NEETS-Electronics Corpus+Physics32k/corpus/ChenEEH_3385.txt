Ensuring the power balance is commonly referred to as regula-
tion and can be sensed by changes in the system frequency. If
load (including losses) exceeds the generation input, then
energy must be leaving the system over time. This energy will
be drawn from the kinetic energy stored in the rotating masses of
the generators. Hence, the generators will begin to rotate more
slowly and the system frequency will decrease. Conversely, if
generation input exceeds the load, then frequency will increase.
It is the responsibility of the governor on a generator to sense
these speed deviations and adjust the power input (say through
the opening or closing of valves on a steam unit) as appropriate.
SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the governor will change the power input in
proportion to the speed deviation. This is referred to as the
droop or speed regulation, R, and can be expressed as:
