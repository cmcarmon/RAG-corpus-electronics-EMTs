The carry lookahead approach can be applied at a higher level to eliminate the propagation of carries between
CLA stages or blocks. This approach uses block carry lookahead adders (BCLAs) and block carry lookahead
(BCL) logic as shown in Fig. 81.54. A BCLA is a CLA modiÔ¨Åed to produce block carry propagate (P) and block
carry  generate  (G)  outputs  instead  of  a  carry-out.  BCL  logic  is  a  combinational  logic  circuit  that  generates
block carries (Cj) for each BCLA from the P and G outputs of lower-order BCLAs and c0. Logic equations for
the block carry logic can be derived by repeated application of the following equations for a typical block:
