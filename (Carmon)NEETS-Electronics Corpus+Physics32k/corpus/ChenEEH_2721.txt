1. The sets of (Ez, Hx, Hy) components located in each
lattice-cut plane k, k þ 1, and so on, are identical and
can be completely represented by any one of these sets,
which we designate as the TMz mode.
2. The sets of (Hz , Ex, Ey) components located in each
lattice-cut plane k þ 1=2, k þ 3=2, and so on, are iden-
tical and can be completely represented by any one of
these sets, which we designate as the TEz mode.
