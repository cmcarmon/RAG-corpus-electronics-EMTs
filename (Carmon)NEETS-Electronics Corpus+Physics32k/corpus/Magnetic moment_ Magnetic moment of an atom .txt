For an atom, individual electron spins are added to get a total spin, and individual orbital angular momenta are added to get a total orbital angular momentum. These two then are added using angular momentum coupling to get a total angular momentum. For an atom with no nuclear magnetic moment, the magnitude of the atomic dipole moment is then

{\displaystyle m_{\text{Atom}}=g_{J}\mu _{\mathrm {B} }{\sqrt {j(j+1)}}}

where j is the total angular momentum quantum number, gJ is the Landé g-factor, and μB is the Bohr magneton. The component of this magnetic moment along the direction of the magnetic field is then

where m is called the magnetic quantum number or the equatorial quantum number, which can take on any of 2j + 1 values:

The negative sign occurs because electrons have negative charge.
Due to the angular momentum, the dynamics of a magnetic dipole in a magnetic field differs from that of an electric dipole in an electric field. The field does exert a torque on the magnetic dipole tending to align it with the field. However, torque is proportional to rate of change of angular momentum, so precession occurs: the direction of spin changes. This behavior is described by the Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert equation:

{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{\gamma }}{\frac {{\rm {d}}\mathbf {m} }{{\rm {d}}t}}=\mathbf {m\times H_{\text{eff}}} -{\frac {\lambda }{\gamma m}}\mathbf {m} \times {\frac {{\rm {d}}\mathbf {m} }{{\rm {d}}t}}}

where γ is the gyromagnetic ratio, m is the magnetic moment, λ is the damping coefficient and Heff is the effective magnetic field (the external field plus any self-induced field). The first term describes precession of the moment about the effective field, while the second is a damping term related to dissipation of energy caused by interaction with the surroundings.
