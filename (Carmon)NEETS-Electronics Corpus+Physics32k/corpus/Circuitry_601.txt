Figure 13.8 shows the block schematic of a simple 
AM transmitter.  An  accurate  and  stable  RF 
oscillator  generates  the  radio  frequency  carrier 
signal.  The  output  of  this  stage  is  then  amplified 
and  passed  to  a  modulated  RF  power  amplifier 
stage. The inclusion of an amplifier between the RF 
oscillator  and  the  modulated  stage  also  helps  to 
improve frequency stability.  
  The  low-level  signal  from  the  microphone  is 
amplified using an AF amplifier before it is passed 
to an AF power amplifier. The output of the power 
amplifier is then fed as the supply to the modulated 
RF power amplifier stage. Increasing and reducing 
the supply to this stage is instrumental in increasing 
and reducing the amplitude of its RF output signal.  
  The modulated RF signal is then passed through 
an aerial tuning unit. This matches the aerial to the 
RF  power  amplifier  and  also  reduces  the  level  of 
unwanted  harmonic  components 
that  may  be 
present.
