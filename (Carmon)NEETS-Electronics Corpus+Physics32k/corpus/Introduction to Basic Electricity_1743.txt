Current in an electric circuit flows from the nega-
tive side of the voltage source through the load to the 
positive side of the voltage source (Figure 14-4). As 
long as the path is not broken, it is a closed circuit and 
current flows (Figure 14-5). However, if the path is 
broken, it is an open circuit and no current can flow 
(Figure 14-6).
