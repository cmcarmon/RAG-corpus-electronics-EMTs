We already know how to ﬁnd the steady-state solution xss(t) for dc or ac sources, and the
principle of superposition can be used if we have more than one source. To ﬁnd that part of
the steady-state solution due to a dc source, deactivate or zero all the other sources, and replace
inductors with short circuits, and capacitors with open circuits, and then solve the resulting circuit
for the voltage or current of interest. To ﬁnd that part of the steady-state solution due to an ac
source, deactivate or zero all the other sources and use the phasor method of Section 3.1. The
solution to Equation (3.2.3) or Equation (3.2.4) is then given by Equation (3.2.5) as the sum of
the transient and steady-state solutions,
