Local Network Topologies
Topology is the manner in which network interface devices
and transmission links are interconnected. There are two
reasons to study the topologies for LAN as well as for WAN.
One is that the mesh (complete) topology, which allows for
every two devices to be directly connected via a dedicate link, is
economically infeasible. The other reason is that different
