The third prong on the power cord provides a direct electrical connection from the appliance
case to earth ground, making the two points electrically common with each other. If they’re
electrically common, then there cannot be any voltage dropped between them. At least, that’s
how it is supposed to work. If the hot conductor accidently touches the metal appliance case, it
will create a direct short-circuit back to the voltage source through the ground wire, tripping
any overcurrent protection devices. The user of the appliance will remain safe.
