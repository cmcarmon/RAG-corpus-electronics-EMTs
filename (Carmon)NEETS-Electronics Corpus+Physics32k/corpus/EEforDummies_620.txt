So why are transistors called transistors? Well, 
the  word  transistor  is  a  combination  of  two 
word parts: trans and resistor.
The trans part of the name conveys the fact 
that  by  placing  a  forward‐biased  voltage  on 
the base‐emitter junction, you cause electrons 
to flow in another part of the component, from 
emitter  to  collector.  You  transfer  the  action 
from one part of the component to another. This 
is known as transistor action.
