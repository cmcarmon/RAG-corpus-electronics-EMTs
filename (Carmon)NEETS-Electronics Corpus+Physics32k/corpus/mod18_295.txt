The mixer-amplifier stage receives three signals: the coherent rf pulse, the local oscillator cw rf
signal, and a dc modulating pulse from the low-voltage modulator. The coherent and local oscillator
signals are mixed to produce sum and difference frequency signals. Either of these may be selected as the
output. The modulator pulse serves the same purpose as in the keyed-oscillator transmitter, because it
determines the pulse width and power level. The mixer stage functions only during the modulator pulse
time. Thus the mixer amplifier produces an output of rf pulses in which the frequency may be either the
sum or difference of the coherent and local oscillator signals.
