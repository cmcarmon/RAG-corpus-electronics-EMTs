SMT is a collection of scientiﬁc and engineering methods needed to design, build, and test products made with
electronic components that mount to the surface of the printed circuit board without holes for leads [Higgins,
1991]. This deﬁnition notes the breadth of topics necessary to understand SMT, and also clearly says that the
successful implementation of SMT will require the use of concurrent engineering [Classon, 1993; Shina, 1991].
Concurrent engineering means that a team of design, manufacturing, test, and marketing people will concern
themselves with board layout, parts and parts placement issues, soldering, cleaning, test, rework, and packaging,
before any product is made. The careful control of all these issues improves both yield and reliability of the
ﬁnal  product.  In  fact,  SMT  cannot  be  reasonably  implemented  without  the  use  of  concurrent  engineering,
and/or the principles contained in Design for Manufacturability (DFM) and Design for Testability (DFT), and
therefore any facility that has not embraced these principles should do so if implementation of SMT is its goal.
