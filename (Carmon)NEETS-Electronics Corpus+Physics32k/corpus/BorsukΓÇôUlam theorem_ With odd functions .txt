A function



g


{\displaystyle g}
is called odd (aka antipodal or antipode-preserving) if for every



x


{\displaystyle x}
:



g
(
−
x
)
=
−
g
(
x
)


{\displaystyle g(-x)=-g(x)}
.
The Borsuk-Ulam theorem is equivalent to the following statement: A continuous odd function from an n-sphere into Euclidean n-space has a zero. PROOF:
If the theorem is correct, then it is specifically correct for odd functions, and for an odd function,



g
(
−
x
)
=
g
(
x
)


{\displaystyle g(-x)=g(x)}
iff



g
(
x
)
=
0


{\displaystyle g(x)=0}
. Hence every odd continuous function has a zero.
For every continuous function



f


{\displaystyle f}
, the following function is continuous and odd:



g
(
x
)
=
f
(
x
)
−
f
(
−
x
)


{\displaystyle g(x)=f(x)-f(-x)}
. If every odd continuous function has a zero, then



g


{\displaystyle g}
has a zero, and therefore,



f
(
x
)
=
f
(
−
x
)


{\displaystyle f(x)=f(-x)}
. Hence the theorem is correct.
