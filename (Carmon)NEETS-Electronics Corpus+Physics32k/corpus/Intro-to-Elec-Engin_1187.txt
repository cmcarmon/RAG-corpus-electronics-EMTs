The dc commutator machines are built in a wide range of sizes, from small control devices
with a 1-W power rating up to the enormous motors of 10,000 hp or more used in rolling-mill
applications. The dc machines today are principally applied as industrial drive motors, particularly
when high degrees of ï¬‚exibility in controlling speed and torque are required. Such motors are
used in steel and aluminum rolling mills, traction motors, overhead cranes, forklift trucks, electric
trains, and golf carts. Commutator machines are also used in portable tools supplied from batteries,
in automobiles as starter motors, in blower motors, and in control applications as actuators and
speed-sensing or position-sensing devices.
