Views A, B, and C of figure 4-28 show the output waveforms of a half-wave and a full-wave 
rectifier. Each waveform is shown with an RC filter connected across the output. The following 
explanation of how a filter works will show you that an RC filter of this type does a much better job than 
the single capacitor filter.
