The primary purpose of a keyboard is to enter or input alphanumeric (numbers, letters, and special 
characters) character codes. The major grouping of keyswitches on a keyboard will be in one of the two 
styles of a typewriter keyboard arrangement (QWERTY or DVORAK). The typewriter keyswitches are 
arranged in 4 rows of 10 or more switches. The keyboard arrangement shown in figure 2-27 is QWERTY. 
The rows are usually offset to the row above to make it easier to reach all the keys when typing. The tops 
of the individual keyswitches are sculptured to conform to the shape of the human finger.
