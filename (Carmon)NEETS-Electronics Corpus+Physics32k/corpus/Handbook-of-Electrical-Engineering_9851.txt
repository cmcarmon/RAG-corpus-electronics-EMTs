the crossover frequency and makes the system slower in terms of its transient response. Of course, this would
be  advantageous  if  high-frequency  noise  is  present  and  we  wish  to  reduce  its  effect.  The  lag  network  is  an
entirely passive device and thus is more economical to instrument than the lead network.
