magnitude has even symmetry: The negative frequency portion is a mirror image of the positive frequency
portion: |H (−f )| = |H (f )|. The phase has odd symmetry: ∠H (−f ) = −∠H (f ). These properties of
this speciﬁc example apply for all transfer functions associated with circuits. Consequently, we don’t need
to plot the negative frequency component; we know what it is from the positive frequency part.
