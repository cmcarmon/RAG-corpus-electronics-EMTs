A group is a mathematical structure (usually denoted in the form



(
G
,
∗
)
)


{\displaystyle (G,*))}
consisting of a set G and a binary operation (*) (often called a 'multiplication'), satisfying the following properties:
Closure: For every pair of elements x and y in G, the product



x
∗
y


{\displaystyle x*y}
is also in G ( in symbols, for every two elements



x
,
y
∈
G
,
x
∗
y


{\displaystyle x,y\in G,x*y}
is also in



G
.


{\displaystyle G.}

Associativity: For every x and y and z in G, both



(
x
∗
y
)
∗
z


{\displaystyle (x*y)*z}
and



x
∗
(
y
∗
z
)


{\displaystyle x*(y*z)}
result with the same element in G ( in symbols,



(
x
∗
y
)
∗
z
=
x
∗
(
y
∗
z
)


{\displaystyle (x*y)*z=x*(y*z)}
for every



x
,
y


{\displaystyle x,y}
, and



z
∈
G


{\displaystyle z\in G}
).
Existence of identity: There must be an element ( say e ) in G such that product any element of G with e make no change to the element ( in symbols,



x
∗
e
=
e
∗
x
=
x


{\displaystyle x*e=e*x=x}
for every



x
∈
G


{\displaystyle x\in G}
).
Existence of inverse: For each element (x ) in G, there must be an element y in G such that product of x and y is the identity element e ( in symbols, for each



x
∈
G


{\displaystyle x\in G}
there is a



y
∈
G


{\displaystyle y\in G}
such that



x
∗
y
=
y
∗
x
=
e


{\displaystyle x*y=y*x=e}
for every;



x
∈
G


{\displaystyle x\in G}
).
Commutative: In addition to the above four, if it so happens that



∀
x
,
y
∈
G


{\displaystyle \forall x,y\in G}
,



x
∗
y
=
y
∗
x


{\displaystyle x*y=y*x}
, then the group is called an Abelian group. Otherwise it is called a non-Abelian group.
