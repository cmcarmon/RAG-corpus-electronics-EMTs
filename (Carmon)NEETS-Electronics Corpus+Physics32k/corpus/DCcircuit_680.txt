With no voltmeter connected to the circuit, there should be exactly 12 volts across each 250
MΩ resistor in the series circuit, the two equal-value resistors dividing the total voltage (24
volts) exactly in half. However, if the voltmeter in question has a lead-to-lead resistance of
10 MΩ (a common amount for a modern digital voltmeter), its resistance will create a parallel
subcircuit with the lower resistor of the divider when connected:
