Busek delivered four MPACS (Micro-Propulsion Attitude Control Systems) that launched aboard the Air Force Academyâ€™s FalconSat-3 mission on March 8, 2007 from Cape Canaveral. The MPACS are integrated micro-pulsed plasma thrusters (microPPTs) and the first US-designed and built coaxial microPPTs in orbit. MPACS provides precise attitude control on small (< 100 kg) satellites and are valuable for missions requiring precise pointing (e.g., high-resolution imaging).
