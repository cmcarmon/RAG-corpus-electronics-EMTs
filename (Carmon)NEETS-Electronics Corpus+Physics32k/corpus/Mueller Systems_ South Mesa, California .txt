South Mesa Water Co. (SMWC) provides water service to about 3,000 customers in Calimesa and Yucaipa, California. The desert-based utility has struggled for years to minimize and reduce consumption, implementing higher rates on customers who used more than 3,500 cubic feet of water every two months. However, this system increased the amount of time spent reading meters and processing billsâ€”it took two meter readers six days every month to read every meter in the system. When the state of California mandated that all water systems reduce usage by 20 percent in 2009, SMWC implemented an initiative to replace its existing metering system with Mueller Systems' Hot Rod AMR System. The amount of time spent collecting meter reads was reduced from six days to four hours, and consumption within SMWC's service area dropped by 22 percent, largely due to the AMR system's real-time monitoring that can detect leaks earlier and provide more detailed usage data to both SMWC and its customers.
