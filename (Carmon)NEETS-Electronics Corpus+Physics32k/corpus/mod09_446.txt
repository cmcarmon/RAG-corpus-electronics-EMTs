As stated in the discussion of time-base generators, the waveform produced from any sawtooth 
generator must be linear. A LINEAR SAWTOOTH is one that has an equal change in voltage for an 
equal change in time. Referring to the Universal Time Constant Chart in figure 3-39, you can see that the 
most desirable part of the charge curve is the first one-tenth (0.1) of the first TC.
