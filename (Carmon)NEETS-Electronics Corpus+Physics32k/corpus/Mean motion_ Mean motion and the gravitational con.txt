Two gravitational constants are commonly used in Solar system celestial mechanics: G, the Newtonian gravitational constant and k, the Gaussian gravitational constant. From the above definitions, mean motion is




n
=




G
(
M
+
m
)


a

.


{\displaystyle n={\sqrt {\frac {G(M+m)}{a^{3}}}}\,\!.}

By normalizing parts of this equation and making some assumptions, it can be simplified, revealing the relation between the mean motion and the constants.
Setting the mass of the Sun to unity, M = 1. The masses of the planets are all much smaller, m ≪ M. Therefore, for any particular planet,




n
≈



G

a

,


{\displaystyle n\approx {\sqrt {\frac {G}{a^{3}}}},}

and also taking the semi-major axis as one astronomical unit,





n

U



≈


G


.


{\displaystyle n_{1\;\mathrm {AU} }\approx {\sqrt {G}}.}

The Gaussian gravitational constant k = √G, therefore, under the same conditions as above, for any particular planet




n
≈


k


a

,


{\displaystyle n\approx {\frac {k}{\sqrt {a^{3}}}},}

and again taking the semi-major axis as one astronomical unit,

{\displaystyle n_{1\;\mathrm {AU} }\approx k.}
