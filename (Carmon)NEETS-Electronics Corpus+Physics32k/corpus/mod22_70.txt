The accuracy of an analog computer is restricted to the accuracy with which physical quantities can 
be sensed and displayed. This, in turn, is related to the quality of the components used in constructing the 
computer; for example, the tolerance of electrical resistors or mechanical shafts and the quality of the 
output equipment. In an analog computer, for example, if the constant is represented by a voltage, it 
probably could be read only to the third decimal place.
