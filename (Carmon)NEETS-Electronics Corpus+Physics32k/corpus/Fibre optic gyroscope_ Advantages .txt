A FOG provides extremely precise rotational rate information, in part because of its lack of cross-axis sensitivity to vibration, acceleration, and shock. Unlike the classic spinning-mass gyroscope, the FOG has no moving parts and doesn't rely on inertial resistance to movement. Hence, this is one alternative to the mechanical gyroscope. Because of their intrinsic reliability, FOGs are used for high performance space applications.
The FOG typically shows a higher resolution than a ring laser gyroscope, but suffered from greater drift and worse scale factor performance until the end of the 1990s.
FOGs are implemented in both open-loop and closed-loop configurations.
