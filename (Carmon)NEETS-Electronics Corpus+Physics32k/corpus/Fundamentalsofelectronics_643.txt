in the next generation is some multiple of the previous one. If this multiple is less than one, the
population becomes extinct; if greater than one, the population ﬂourishes. The same diﬀerence
equation also describes the eﬀect of compound interest on deposits. Here, n indexes the times at
which compounding occurs (daily, monthly, etc.), a equals the compound interest rate plus one,
and b = 1 (the bank provides no gain). In signal processing applications, we typically require that
the output remain bounded for any input. For our example, that means that we restrict |a| < 1
and choose values for it and the gain according to the application.
Exercise 5.26
Note that the diﬀerence equation (5.42),
