Multitronic offers performance and economy similar to, and in some cases better than, the equivalent five-speed manual gearboxes, and superior to the traditional automatic transmission. Particular performance advantages are noticed with 'in-gear' seamless acceleration times over equivalent manual transmission cars.
Multitronic was offered on front wheel drive-only versions of the Audi A4, Audi A5, Audi A6, and the SEAT Exeo with the 2.0 TSI gasoline engine. It is not compatible with the quattro four-wheel drive system, nor transverse engine installations such as in the Audi A3. At first, the torque limit was 310 newton metres (229 lbf⋅ft), but the transmission is now modified to withstand 400 newton metres (295 lbf⋅ft) torque. In 2014 Audi announced to discontinue Multitronic and replace it with S tronic, effectively making the Audi A5 8T the last model it was sold with.
