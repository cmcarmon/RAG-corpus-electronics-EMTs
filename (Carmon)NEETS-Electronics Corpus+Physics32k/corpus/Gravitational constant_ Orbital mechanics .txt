In astrophysics, it is convenient to measure distances in parsecs (pc), velocities in kilometers per second (km/s) and masses in solar units M⊙. In these units, the gravitational constant is:

{\displaystyle G\approx 4.302\times 10^{-3}{\rm {\ pc}}\ M_{\odot }^{-1}{\rm {\ (km/s)^{2}}}.\,}

For situations where tides are important, the relevant length scales are solar radii, rather than parsecs. In these units, the gravitational constant is:

In orbital mechanics, the period P of an object in circular orbit around a spherical object obeys

This way of expressing G shows the relationship between the average density of a planet and the period of a satellite orbiting just above its surface.

where distance is measured in astronomical units (AU), time in years, and mass in solar masses (M⊙).
