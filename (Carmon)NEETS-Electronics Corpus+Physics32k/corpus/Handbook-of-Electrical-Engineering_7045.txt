The Huffman Algorithm
ø (called the Shannon code lengths) is close to optimal, but not
The choice of code word lengths li = Ølog 1/pi
necessarily optimal, in terms of average code word length. We will now describe an algorithm (the Huffman
algorithm) that produces an instantaneous code of minimal average length for a random variable with distri-
bution p1, p2, . . ., pm . The algorithm is a greedy algorithm for building a tree from the bottom up.
