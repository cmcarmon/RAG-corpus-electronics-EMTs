{\displaystyle AV={\frac {24.5(PO_{gpm})}{ID^{2}-OD^{2}}}\,}

Where:
AV = annular velocity in Ft/min (feet per minute)
PObpm = pump output in bpm (barrels per minute) 1 barrel = 42 gallons
POgpm = pump output in gpm (gallons per minute) 1 gallon = 0.0238095238 barrels
ID2 = inside diameter of the wellbore or casing, squared
OD2 = outside diameter of the drill pipe or tubing, squared
1029.4 = A conversion factor constant used to calculate the volume between the outside of a tube within the inside of another tube, using barrels.
24.5 = A conversion factor constant used to calculate the volume between the outside of a tube within the inside of another tube, using gallons.
Pump Output = Refers to the measurement of the quantity of a fluid (to put that fluid in motion).
