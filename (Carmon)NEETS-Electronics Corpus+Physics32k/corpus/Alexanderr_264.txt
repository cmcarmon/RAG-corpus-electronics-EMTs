5.10.1 Digital-to-Analog Converter
The  digital-to-analog  converter  (DAC)  transforms  digital  signals  into
analog  form.  A typical  example  of  a  four-bit  DAC  is  illustrated  in
Fig. 5.36(a). The four-bit DAC can be realized in many ways. A sim-
ple  realization  is  the  binary  weighted  ladder,  shown  in  Fig.  5.36(b).
The  bits  are  weights  according  to  the  magnitude  of  their  place  value,
by  descending  value  of  Rf兾Rn so  that  each  lesser  bit  has  half  the
weight of  the  next  higher.  This  is  obviously  an  inverting  summing
ampliﬁer.  The  output  is  related  to  the  inputs  as  shown  in  Eq.  (5.15).
Thus,
