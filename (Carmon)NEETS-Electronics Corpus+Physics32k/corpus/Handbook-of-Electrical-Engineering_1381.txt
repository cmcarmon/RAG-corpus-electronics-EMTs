of the phase can be shown to be the phase of the noisy signal within the HMM statistical framework. Normally,
the spectral subtraction approach is used with b = 2, which corresponds to an artiﬁcially elevated noise level.
The spectral subtraction approach has been very popular since it is relatively easy to implement; it makes
minimal assumptions about the signal and noise; and when carefully implemented, it results in reasonably clear
enhanced signals. A major drawback of the spectral subtraction enhancement approach, however, is that the
residual noise has annoying tonal characteristics referred to as “musical noise.” This noise consists of narrowband
signals  with  time-varying  frequencies  and  amplitudes.  Another  major  drawback  of  the  spectral  subtraction
approach is that its optimality in any given sense has never been proven. Thus, no systematic methodology for
improving  the  performance  of  this  approach  has  been  developed,  and  all  attempts  to  achieve  this  goal  have
been  based  on  purely  heuristic  arguments. As  a  result,  a  family  of  spectral  subtraction  speech  enhancement
approaches have been developed and experimentally optimized.
