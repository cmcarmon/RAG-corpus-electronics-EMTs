Another  circuit  topology  commonly  encountered  is  the  bridge  rectiÔ¨Åer.  Figure  5.6  illustrates  single-  and
three-phase  versions  of  the  circuit.  In  the  single-phase  circuit  diodes  D1  and  D4  conduct  on  the  positive
half-cycle  of  the  input  while  D2  and  D3  conduct  on  the  negative  half-cycle  of  the  input.  Alternate  pairs  of
diodes conduct in the three-phase circuit depending on the relative amplitude of the source signals.
