MEMSCaP is based on CADENCE set of tools, which are the
most popular IC design tools (www.memscap.com). MEMS-
CaP enables the design ï¬‚ow either from the bottom up or the
top down and incorporates the MEMS design environment
into an existing and well-known IC environment. It permits
easy IP or design reuse and the ability to exchange data be-
tween multidisciplinary teams. Because the MEMSCaP simu-
lator is based on CADENCE environment, the designer can
simulate a MEMS device using the IC schematics or hardware
