ﬁelds with respect to z must equal zero. Under these conditions,
the full set of Maxwell’s curl equations given by equations 9.9
and 9.10 reduces to two modes: the transverse-magnetic mode
with respect to z (TMz) and the transverse-electric mode with
respect to z (TEz). The reduced sets of Maxwell’s equations for
these modes are as follows.
