In Figure 14-22, point A is one junction and point 
B is the second junction. Following the current in the 
circuit, IT flows from the voltage source into the junc-
tion at point A. There the current splits among the 
three branches as shown. Each of the three branch cur-
rents (I1, I2, and I3) flows out of junction A. According 
to Kirchhoffâ€™s current law, which states that the total
