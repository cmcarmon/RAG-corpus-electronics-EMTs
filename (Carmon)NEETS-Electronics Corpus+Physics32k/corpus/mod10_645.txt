The positions marked off on the two polar-coordinate graphs in figures 4-10 and 4-12 were selected 
and numbered arbitrarily. However, a standard method allows the positions around a source to be marked 
off so that one radiation pattern can easily be compared with another. This method is based on the fact 
that a circle has a radius of 360 degrees. The radius extending vertically from the center (position 0 in 
figure 4-10) is designated 0 degrees. At position 4 the radius is at a right angle to the 0-degree radius. 
Accordingly, the radius at position 4 is marked 90 degrees, position 8 is 180 degrees, position 12 is 270 
degrees, and position 16 is 360 degrees. The various radii drawn on the graph are all marked according to 
the angle each radius makes with the reference radius at 0 degrees.
