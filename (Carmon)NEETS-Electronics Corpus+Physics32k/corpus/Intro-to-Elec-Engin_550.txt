does not receive the Ô¨Årst change instruction, but it does receive the second one. At the time of the
second change instruction, Q1 is still 1; it changes to 0 shortly afterward, but by that time FF2
has already been triggered. Similarly, FF3 is triggered only when Q1 and Q2 are both equal to 1.
Thus, from the timing diagram, the successive states of Q3 Q2 Q1 can be seen as 000, 001, 010,
011, 100, 101, 110, 111, 000, 001, . . . , as required for a counter.
