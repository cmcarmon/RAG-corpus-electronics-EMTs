Photoconductors
Semiconductors can act as photoconductors, where incident light increases the carrier density, thus increasing
the conductivity. There are two basic types, intrinsic and extrinsic. Figure 31.9 shows a simple energy diagram
containing conduction and valence bands. Also indicated are the levels which occur with the introduction of
donor and acceptor impurities.
