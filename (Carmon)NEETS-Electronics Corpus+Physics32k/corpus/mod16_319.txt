SHUNT RESISTANCE.â€”A single, standardized meter movement is normally used in all
ammeters, no matter what the range is for a particular meter. For example, meters with working ranges of
0 to 10 amperes, 0 to 5 amperes, or 0 to 1 ampere all use the same meter movement. The various ranges
are achieved through the use of different values of shunt resistance with the same meter movement. The
designer of the ammeter simply calculates the correct shunt resistance required to extend the range of the
meter movement to measure any desired value of current. This shunt is then connected across the meter
terminals. Shunts may be located inside the meter case (internal shunts) with the proper switching
arrangements for changing them. They may also be located outside the meter case (external shunts) with
the necessary leads to connect them to the meter.
