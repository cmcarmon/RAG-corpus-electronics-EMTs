In the derivation of the mathematical/circuit model for salient-rotor
machines,  the  stator  ﬁeld  B2  can  be  resolved  into  two  components;
when the rotor is viewed from a cross section, one component aligns
along the rotor and the other is perpendicular to the rotor (Fig. 66.5).
The component Bd, which directly opposes the rotor ﬁeld, is said to
belong  to  the  direct  axis;  the  other  component,  Bq,  is  weaker  and
belongs to the quadrature axis. The model for a salient-rotor machine
consists of two circuits, direct-axis circuit and quadrature-axis circuit,
each similar to Fig. 66.4. Any quantity of interest, such as Ia, the current
in winding aa¢, is made up of two components, one from each circuit.
The round-rotor machine can be viewed as a special case of the salient-
pole  theory  where  the  corresponding  parameters  of  the  d-axis  and
q-axis circuits are equal.
