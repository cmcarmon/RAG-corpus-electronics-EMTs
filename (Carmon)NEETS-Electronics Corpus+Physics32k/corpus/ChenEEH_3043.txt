The technical operation of the power grid, however, has not
changed much. The interconnected transmission network is
still the same. Some of these interconnected transmission
networks are very large, spanning vast geographical areas.
The North American power grid is shown in Figure 1.3 and
divided up into reliability regions that plan and operate the
regional portion of the grid in a coordinated fashion. The
Western region (WSCC) and Texas (ERCOT) are only con-
nected to the rest of the grid with dc ties instead of ac. The
Eastern Interconnection is synchronously connected through
the ac transmission and is the largest synchronously connected
power grid in the world with 687 GW of installed generation
and 128,000 miles of transmission.
