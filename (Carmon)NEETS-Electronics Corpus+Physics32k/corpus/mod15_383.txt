Figure 3-20 is a simplified drawing of a basic accelerometer. It consists of a mass that is free to slide 
along the sensitive axis within the case. The movement of the mass is limited by the springs. When the 
case is accelerated, the mass, because of its inertia, tends to remain stationary. This results in a relative 
movement of the mass with respect to the case. When the stretch of the springs overcomes the inertia of 
the mass, the springs cause the mass to stop moving with respect to the case. The displacement of the 
mass with respect to the case is directly proportional to the acceleration of the case. When the case stops 
accelerating, the springs return the mass to its zero position (the reference position). To keep the springs 
from causing the mass to overshoot and oscillate about the reference position, some form of damping is 
needed. This is usually provided by an oil-filled case with vanes for oil to bypass the mass.
