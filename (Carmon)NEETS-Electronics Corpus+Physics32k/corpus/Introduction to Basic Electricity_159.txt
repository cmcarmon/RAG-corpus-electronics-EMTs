	
On	a	sunny	day,	try	heading	outside	of	your	house,	then,	checking	out	the	electrical
connections	(wires)	from	one	post	to	another.	More	likely,	one,	two,	or	even	a	flock	of
birds	are	calmly	resting	on	power	lines.
Do	you	ever	wonder	why	they	don’t	get	shocked?
No,	birds	are	normal	creatures;	they	do	not	possess	extra-special	powers.	In	their	heads,
they	understand	that	it’s	a	must	not	to	step	on	open	electrical	networks,	which	is	one	of	the
things	that	need	to	be	covered	for	beginners	in	circuit	engineering.
