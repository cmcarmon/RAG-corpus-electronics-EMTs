where d is the sample thickness and where the subscript “sq” denotes a sheet (arreal) quantity (cm–2) rather
than a volume quantity (cm–3). If some of the carriers are holes, rather than electrons, then the sign of e for
those  carriers  must  be  reversed.  The  general  convention  is  that  RH  is  negative  for  electrons  and  positive  for
2  exactly  balance  at  a  given  temperature,
holes.  In  some  cases,  the  hole  and  electron  contributions  to  RHsq
and this quantity vanishes.
