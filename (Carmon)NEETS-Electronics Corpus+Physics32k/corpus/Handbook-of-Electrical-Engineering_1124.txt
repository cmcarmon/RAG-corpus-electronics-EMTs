Equiripple FIR ﬁlters are usually designed using the Parks-McClellan computer program [Parks and Burrus,
1987], which uses the Remez exchange algorithm to determine iteratively the extremal frequencies at which the
maximum deviations in the error function occur. A listing of this program along with a detailed description
of its use is available in several references including Parks and Burrus [1987] and DSP Committee [1979]. The
program is executed by specifying as inputs the desired band edges, gain for each band (usually 0 or 1), band
weighting, and FIR length. If the resulting ﬁlter has too much ripple in some bands, those bands can be weighted
more heavily and the ﬁlter redesigned. Details on this design procedure are discussed in Rabiner [1973], along
with  approximate  design  relationships  which  aid  in  selecting  the  ﬁlter  length  needed  to  meet  a  given  set  of
speciﬁcations.
