Page description languages are desktop publishing formats that produce graphical output on a printer, display,
or other output device. They are used in application programs such as composition systems and illustrators
where text, graphical shapes, and sampled images are to be combined into a single document. The dominant
language  in  this  category  is  PostScript,  which  is  a  simple  interpretive  programming  language  with  powerful
graphics capabilities. It communicates the description of a document to a printing system in a high level, device-
independent manner. PostScript features construction of arbitrary shapes, which may self-intersect, be painted,
transformed, cropped, or rendered. The commands are embedded in a general purpose programming language.
PostScript programs can be created, transmitted, and interpreted in the form of ASCII source text. The resultant
representations will allow for document interchange [Adobe, 1990].
