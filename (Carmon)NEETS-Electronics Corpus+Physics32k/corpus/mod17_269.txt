Figure 2-27 shows another widely used type of afc and its circuitry. This type is commonly referred
to as a BALANCED-PHASE DETECTOR or PHASE-DISCRIMINATOR. This circuit uses fixed
capacitors and the varying conductance of the diodes to achieve a variable reactance. As you have seen in
the block diagram, an afc circuit requires two sections, a frequency detector and a variable reactance. Our
detector output is a dc control voltage proportional to the amount of frequency change. This dc voltage is
applied directly to the oscillator. The phase inverter input signals are discriminated IF outputs fed to the
two diodes 180 degrees out of phase.
