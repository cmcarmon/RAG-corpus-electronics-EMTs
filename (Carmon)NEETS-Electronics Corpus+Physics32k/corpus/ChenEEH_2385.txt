The r-independent parts of the corresponding power density
functions are pd, pdu, and pdf. The r-independent parts of the
corresponding electric ﬁeld functions are f , fu, ff. These power
density and ﬁeld functions may be normalized with respect to
their maximum total values pd max and fmax respectively:
