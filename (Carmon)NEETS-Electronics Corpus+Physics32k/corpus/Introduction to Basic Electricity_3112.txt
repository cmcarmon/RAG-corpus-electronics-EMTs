The ability of a zener diode to dissipate power 
decreases as the temperature increases. Therefore, 
power	 dissipation	 ratings are given for spe-
cific temperatures. Power ratings are also based on 
lead lengths: shorter leads dissipate more power. A 
 derating	 factor is given by the diode manufac-
turer to determine the power rating at different tem-
peratures from the ones specified in their tables. For 
 example, a derating factor of 6 mW per degree Celsius 
means that the diode power rating decreases 6 mW for 
each degree of change in temperature.
