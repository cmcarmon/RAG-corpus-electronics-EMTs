Consider the simplest diatomic molecule, the H2+ ion. The ground state of this molecule is bonding and the first excited state is antibonding. This means that when we plot the potential energy of the molecule (i.e. the average electrostatic energy of the two protons and the electron plus the kinetic energy of the latter) as the function of proton-proton separation, the ground state has a minimum but the excited state is repulsive (see Fig. 1a). Normally, the molecule is in the ground state, in one of the lowest vibrational levels (marked by horizontal lines).
In the presence of light, the molecule may absorb a photon (violet arrow), provided its frequency matches the energy difference between the ground and the excited states. The excited state is unstable and the molecule dissociates within femtoseconds into hydrogen atom and a proton releasing kinetic energy (red arrow). This is the usual description of photon absorption, which works well at low intensity. At high intensity, however, the interaction of the light with the molecule is so strong that the potential energy curves become distorted. To take this distortion into account requires "dressing" the molecule in photons.
