A lumped-parameter model for dynamical studies typically will include the voltage equations of the windings,
derived  using  a  coupled  circuit  approach,  and  an  expression  for  the  developed  electromagnetic  torque.  The
latter is obtained from an expression of the developed electromagnetic power by considering the input power
expression  and  allowing  for  losses  and  magnetic  energy  storage  terms.  The  expression  for  the  developed
electromagnetic torque is obtained by dividing that for developed electromagnetic power by the rotor mechan-
ical  speed.  The  rotor  speed,  in  turn,  is  determined  by  an  equation  of  the  rotor’s  dynamics  that  equates  the
rotor’s inertia torque to its acceleration torque.
