Reversing voltage polarity to an electrolytic capacitor may result in the destruction of that
super-thin dielectric layer, thus ruining the device. However, the thinness of that dielectric
permits extremely high values of capacitance in a relatively small package size. For the same
reason, electrolytic capacitors tend to be low in voltage rating as compared with other types of
capacitor construction.
