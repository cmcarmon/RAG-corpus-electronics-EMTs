When an electron is free to assume higher energy states around an atom’s nucleus (due to
its placement in a particular ”shell”), it may be free to break away from the atom and comprise
part of an electric current through the substance. If the quantum limitations imposed on an
electron deny it this freedom, however, the electron is considered to be ”bound” and cannot
break away (at least not easily) to constitute a current. The former scenario is typical of
conducting materials, while the latter is typical of insulating materials.
