The mode theory, along with the ray theory, is used to describe the propagation of light along an
optical fiber. The mode theory is used to describe the properties of light that ray theory is unable to
explain. The mode theory uses electromagnetic wave behavior to describe the propagation of light along a
fiber. A set of guided electromagnetic waves is called the modes of the fiber.
