*14.3.2 If the signal in Example 14.3.1 has a bandwidth of
600 kHz, determine Pout/Nout assuming a noise-
less ampliﬁer. Then check to see whether it is
possible to obtain Pout/Nout ≥ 105.
14.3.3 A simple RC ﬁlter yields |H (ω)|2 = 1/[1 +
(ω/ωco)2], whereas a more sophisticated and rel-
atively more expensive Butterworth ﬁlter gives
|H (ω)|2 = 1/[1 + (ω/ωco)4]. Either of these
can be used to reduce the hum amplitude. Let
an information signal with signiﬁcant frequency
content for f ≤ 30 Hz be contaminated by ac
hum at 120 Hz. The contaminated signal is then
applied to a low-pass ﬁlter to reduce the hum
amplitude by a factor of α. For (i) α = 0.25,
and (ii) α = 0.1, determine the required cutoff
frequency f co for (a) the RC ﬁlter, and (b) the
Butterworth ﬁlter, and suggest the ﬁlter to be used
in each case.
