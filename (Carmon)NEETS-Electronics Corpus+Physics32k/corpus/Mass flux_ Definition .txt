Mathematically, mass flux is defined as the limit:

{\displaystyle j_{m}=\lim \limits _{A\rightarrow 0}{\frac {I_{m}}{A}}}

where:

{\displaystyle I_{m}=\lim \limits _{\Delta t\rightarrow 0}{\frac {\Delta m}{\Delta t}}={\frac {dm}{dt}}}

is the mass current (flow of mass m per unit time t) and A is the area through which the mass flows through.
For mass flux as a vector jm, the surface integral it over a surface S, followed by an integral over the time duration t1 to t2, gives the total amount of mass flowing through the surface in that time (t2 − t1):

The area required to calculate the flux is real or imaginary, flat or curved, either as a cross-sectional area or a surface.
For example, for substances passing through a filter or a membrane, the real surface is the (generally curved) surface area of the filter, macroscopically - ignoring the area spanned by the holes in the filter/membrane. The spaces would be cross-sectional areas. For liquids passing through a pipe, the area is the cross-section of the pipe, at the section considered.
The vector area is a combination of the magnitude of the area through which the mass passes through, A, and a unit vector normal to the area,

where · is the dot product of the unit vectors. This is, the component of mass flux passing through the surface (i.e. normal to it) is jm cos θ, while the component of mass flux passing tangential to the area is jm sin θ, but there is no mass flux actually passing through the area in the tangential direction. The only component of mass flux passing normal to the area is the cosine component.
