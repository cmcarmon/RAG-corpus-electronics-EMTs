Cockcroft-Walton generator – a similar circuit which has the same "ladder" structure. CW generator produces a constant DC.
Vector inversion generator A transmission line device using a similar charge in parallel discharge in series approach
Explosively pumped flux compression generator – A solution to the dual problem of creating high current pulses
Ignition coil
Induction coil
Tesla coil
Transformer – A circuit component that is analogous to using mechanical gears to increase torque or speed. Can convert AC from one voltage and current, to another. Any increase in voltage will result in a reduction in current. The opposite is also true.
