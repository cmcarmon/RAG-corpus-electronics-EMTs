the MOSFETâ€™s drain negative with respect to the 
source. EGS also makes the gate negative with respect 
to the source. Only when EGS increases from 0 volts 
and  applies  a  negative  voltage  to  the  gate  does 
a  substantial amount of drain current flow. The 
 substrate is  normally connected to the source, but in 
special  applications the substrate and source may be at 
different potentials.
