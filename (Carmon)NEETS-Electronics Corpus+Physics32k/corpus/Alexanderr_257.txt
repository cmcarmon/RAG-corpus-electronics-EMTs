When  op  amp  circuits  are  cascaded,  each  circuit  in  the  string  is
called a stage; the original input signal is increased by the gain of the
individual stage. Op amp circuits have the advantage that they can be
cascaded without changing their input-output relationships. This is due to
the fact that each (ideal) op amp circuit has inÔ¨Ånite input resistance and
zero output resistance. Figure 5.28 displays a block diagram represen-
tation of three op amp circuits in cascade. Since the output of one stage
is the input to the next stage, the overall gain of the cascade connection
is the product of the gains of the individual op amp circuits, or
