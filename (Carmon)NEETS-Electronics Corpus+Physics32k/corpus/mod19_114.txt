The most effective immediate treatment of burns and of pain is to immerse the burned area in cold 
water or to apply cold compresses if immersion is impracticable. Cold water not only minimizes pain, but 
also reduces the burning effect in the deeper layers of the skin. Gently pat dry the area with lint-free cloth 
or gauze. Aspirin is also effective for the relief of pain. Continue treatment until no pain is felt when the 
burned area is exposed to the air.
