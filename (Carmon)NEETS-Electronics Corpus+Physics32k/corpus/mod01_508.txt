Each of the resistors in a series circuit consumes power which is dissipated in the form of heat. Since
this power must come from the source, the total power must be equal to the power consumed by the
circuit resistances. In a series circuit the total power is equal to the SUM of the power dissipated by the
individual resistors. Total power (PT) is equal to:
