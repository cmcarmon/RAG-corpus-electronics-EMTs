Data Analysis
The  primary  quantities  determined  from  Hall  effect  and  conductivity  measurements  are  the  Hall  carrier
concentration (nH or pH) and mobility (µ
H). As already discussed, nH = –1/eRH, where RH is given by Eq. (22.120)
σ = RH/ρ, where ρ is given by Eq. (22.117). Although simple
(for a van der Pauw conﬁguration), and µ
300-K values of ρ, nH, and µ
H are quite important and widely used, it is in temperature-dependent Hall (TDH)
measurements that the real power of the Hall technique is demonstrated, because then the donor and acceptor
concentrations and energies can be determined. The methodology is illustrated with a GaN example.
