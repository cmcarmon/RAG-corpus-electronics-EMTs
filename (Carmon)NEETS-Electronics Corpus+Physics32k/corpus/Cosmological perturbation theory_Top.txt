In physical cosmology, cosmological perturbation theory is the theory by which the evolution of structure is understood in the big bang model. It uses general relativity to compute the gravitational forces causing small perturbations to grow and eventually seed the formation of stars, quasars, galaxies and clusters. It only applies to situations in which the universe is predominantly homogeneous, such as during cosmic inflation and large parts of the big bang. The universe is believed to still be homogeneous enough that the theory is a good approximation on the largest scales, but on smaller scales more involved techniques, such as N-body simulations, must be used.
Because of the gauge invariance of general relativity, the correct formulation of cosmological perturbation theory is subtle. There are currently two distinct approaches to perturbation theory in classical general relativity:
gauge-invariant perturbation theory based on foliating a space-time with hyper-surfaces, and
1+3 covariant gauge-invariant perturbation theory based on threading a space-time with frames.
