In the case of ferromagnetic systems containing air gaps, a useful approximation for making
quick estimates is to consider the ferromagnetic material to have inÔ¨Ånite permeability. The relative
permeability of iron is considered so high that practically all the ampere-turns of the winding are
consumed in the air gaps alone.
