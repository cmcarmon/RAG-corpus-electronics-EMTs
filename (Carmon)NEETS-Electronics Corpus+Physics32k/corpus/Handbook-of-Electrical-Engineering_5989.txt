In practice, the interface module can be of physical or ﬁctitious origin — the latter essentially a convenient
but  acceptable  approximation.  Referring  again  to  Fig.  66.32  of  the  power  supply  connected  to  the  motor,
examples of an interface module of physical origin would be where shunt ﬁltering capacitors or bleeding resistors
are actually present at the terminals of the motor windings. Written with current as input and voltage as output,
the equations for simulating the shunt capacitor and the shunt bleeding resistor are
