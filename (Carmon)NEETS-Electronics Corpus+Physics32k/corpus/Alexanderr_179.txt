In Section 3.6, we saw that node-voltage (or mesh-current) equa-
tions can be obtained by mere inspection of a circuit when the sources
are  all  independent  current  (or  all  independent  voltage)  sources.  It  is
therefore expedient in circuit analysis to be able to substitute a voltage
source  in  series  with  a  resistor  for  a  current  source  in  parallel  with  a
