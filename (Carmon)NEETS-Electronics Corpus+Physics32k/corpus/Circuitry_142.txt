Finally,  itâ€™s  worth  checking  these  results  with  the 
Current Law equation (i): 
 
+I1 + I2 4I3 = 0
Inserting our values for I1, I2 and I3 gives: 
 
+0.068 + 0.136 4204 = 0
Since the left and right hand sides of the equation 
are equal  we can be reasonably confident that our 
results are correct.
