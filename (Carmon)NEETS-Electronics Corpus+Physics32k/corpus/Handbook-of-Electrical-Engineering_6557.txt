Connectors and Splices
Connections between ﬁbers and between the ﬁber and other components occur at numerous points in a long-
distance link. Because there may be many splices in a long system, the loss of each one must be small. Fusion
splices with an average loss of no more than 0.05 dB are often speciﬁed. Mechanical splices are also suitable.
They  often  involve  epoxy  for  ﬁxing  the  connection.  Connectors  are  used  where  remateable  connections  are
required. Good ﬁber connectors introduce losses of just a few tenths of a decibel.
