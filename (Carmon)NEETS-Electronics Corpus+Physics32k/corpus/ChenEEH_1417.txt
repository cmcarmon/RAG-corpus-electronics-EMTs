Burns et al. (1997) have proposed a run-time system for
managing the dynamic reconÔ¨Åguration of FPGAs. The system
incorporates operating-system style services that permit high-
level operations on circuits, such as circuit transformations
and dynamic rerouting of circuits. Shirazi et al. (1998b) have
also incorporated circuit transformations into their run-time
manager.
