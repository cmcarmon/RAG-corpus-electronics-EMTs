Still  another  approach  to  improving  UHF  transmitter  efÔ¨Åciency  involves  entirely  new  classes  of  vacuum
tubes: the Klystrode (also known as the inductive output tube, IOT) and the multistage depressed collector
(MSDC)  klystron.  (The  Klystrode  is  a  registered  trademark  of Varian.)  The  IOT  is  a  device  that  essentially
combines the cathode/grid structure of the tetrode with the drift tube/collector structure of the klystron. The
MSDC klystron incorporates a collector assembly that operates at progressively lower voltage levels. The net
effect for the MSDC is to recover energy from the electron stream rather than dissipating the energy as heat.
