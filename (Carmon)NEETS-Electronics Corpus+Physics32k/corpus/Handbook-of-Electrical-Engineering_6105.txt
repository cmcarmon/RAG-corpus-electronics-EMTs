Where the capability chart is extended to cover more than one power system component, the two-dimensional
capability chart associated with a single busbar can be regarded as being a single slice of an overall 2
n
 dimensional
capability chart for the 
n
 busbars that make up a general power system. If the system is small, a contour plotting
approach can be used to gradually trace out the locus on the complex power plane. A load ï¬‚ow algorithm is
used to iteratively solve the operating equations at each point on the contour, without having to resort to an
explicit closed form solution.
