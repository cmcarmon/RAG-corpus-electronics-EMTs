This patent describes a device that uses very powerful magnetic ﬁelds to resonate the nuclei in cells
in a body. Collapsing the ﬁeld and measuring the relaxation times gave a comparison to healthy cells.
Later advances in digital signal processing have resulted in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) equipment
with color-coded image viewing of living tissue and its chemical composition. (Copyright © 1995, DewRay
