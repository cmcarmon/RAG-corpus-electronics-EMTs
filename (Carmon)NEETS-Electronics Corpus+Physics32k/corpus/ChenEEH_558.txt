The P-i-N diode has a punchthrough structure as described
earlier and has an nþ region at the end of the drift region
opposite from the rectifying junction. The nþ region provides
an ohmic cathode contact and injects electrons into the drift
region under high-level injection. When the diode is forward
biased, the pþ anode injects minority holes into the drift
region, resulting in current ﬂow. The forward bias current
ﬂow is determined by recombination of the minority carriers
injected into the drift region. The device conducts in low-level
injection regime when the injected minority carrier density is
