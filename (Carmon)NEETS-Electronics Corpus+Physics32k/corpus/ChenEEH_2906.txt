The principle of tracking radar is to use the error signal to
adjust the antenna’s pointing direction. The difference between
the target direction and the reference direction, usually the axis
of the antenna, is deﬁned as the angular error. The tracking
radar attempts to position the antenna with zero angular error
(i.e., to locate the target along the reference direction).
