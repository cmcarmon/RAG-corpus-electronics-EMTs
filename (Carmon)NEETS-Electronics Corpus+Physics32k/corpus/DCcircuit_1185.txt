Fuses are primarily rated, as one might expect, in the unit for current: amps. Although
their operation depends on the self-generation of heat under conditions of excessive current
by means of the fuseâ€™s own electrical resistance, they are engineered to contribute a negligible
amount of extra resistance to the circuits they protect. This is largely accomplished by making
