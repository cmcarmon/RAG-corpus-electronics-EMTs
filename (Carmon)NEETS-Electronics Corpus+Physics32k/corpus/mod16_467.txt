To measure ac voltages, you must set the function switch to the AC position. The same procedure
used to measure dc voltages applies, except that in reading the voltage, you use the AC volts scale (the
polarity of the test leads is not important). When measuring very low or high frequencies of ac voltages,
you should be aware that the multimeter has a tendency to be inaccurate. View A of figure 4-6 is a
