Frequency reuse: A way to increase the effective bandwidth of a satellite system when available spectrum is
limited. Dual polarizations and multiple beams pointing to different earth regions may utilize the same
frequencies as long as, for example, the gain of one beam or polarization in the directions of the other
beams or polarization (and vice versa) is low enough. Isolations of 27 to 35 dB are typical for reuse systems.
