After the tire has been cured, there are several additional operations. Tire uniformity measurement is a test where the tire is automatically mounted on wheel halves, inflated, run against a simulated road surface, and measured for force variation. Tire balance measurement is a test where the tire is automatically placed on wheel halves, rotated at a high speed and measured for imbalance.
Large commercial truck/bus tires, as well as some passenger and light truck tires, are inspected by X-ray or magnetic induction based inspection machines, that can penetrate the rubber to analyze the steel cord structure.
In the final step, tires are inspected by human eyes for numerous visual defects such as incomplete mold fill, exposed cords, blisters, blemishes, and others.
