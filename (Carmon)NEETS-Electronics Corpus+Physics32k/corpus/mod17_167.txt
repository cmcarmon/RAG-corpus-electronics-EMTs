You should remember the properties of modulation envelopes from your study of NEETS, Module
12, Modulation Principles. A carrier that has been modulated by voice or music is accompanied by two
identical sidebands, each carrying the same intelligence. In amplitude-modulated (AM) transmitters, the
carrier and both sidebands are transmitted. In a single-sideband transmitter (ssb), only one of the
sidebands, the upper or the lower, is transmitted while the remaining sideband and the carrier are
suppressed. SUPPRESSION is the elimination of the undesired portions of the signal.
