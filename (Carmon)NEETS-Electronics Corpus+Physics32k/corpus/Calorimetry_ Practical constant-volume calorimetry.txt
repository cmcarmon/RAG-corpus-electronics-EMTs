Constant-volume calorimetry is calorimetry performed at a constant volume. This involves the use of a constant-volume calorimeter.
No work is performed in constant-volume calorimetry, so the heat measured equals the change in internal energy of the system. The heat capacity at constant volume is assumed to be independent of temperature.
Heat is measured by the principle of calorimetry.

{\displaystyle q=C_{V}\Delta T=\Delta U\,,}

where
ΔU is change in internal energy,
ΔT is change in temperature and
CV is the heat capacity at constant volume.
In constant-volume calorimetry the pressure is not held constant. If there is a pressure difference between initial and final states, the heat measured needs adjustment to provide the enthalpy change. One then has

{\displaystyle \Delta H=\Delta U+\Delta (PV)=\Delta U+V\Delta P\,,}

where
ΔH is change in enthalpy and
V is the unchanging volume of the sample chamber.
