Simply stated, when there is no total time-varying charge within an element,
the total current into the element is 0. Returning to our filament example, if
there is no current flow across the curved cylindrical surface of the filament, we
can rewrite the total current flowing into the element as the different between
the current flowing into the end surface at x and the current flowing out of the
end surface at y:
