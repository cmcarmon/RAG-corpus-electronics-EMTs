The microstrip antenna produces maximum radiation in the
broadside (perpendicular to the substrate) direction and ideally
no radiation in the end-ﬁre (along the surface of the substrate)
direction. The size of the antenna is usually designed such that
the antenna resonates at the operating frequency, producing
a real input impedance. For a rectangular microstrip antenna,
this requires the length of the antenna, L, to be about half a
wavelength in the dielectric medium. The width of the antenna,
W, on the other hand, determines the level of the input imped-
ance. The microstrip antenna can be thought of as a rectangular
cavity with open sidewalls. The fringing ﬁelds through the open
sidewalls are responsible for the radiation. However, the struc-
ture is principally a resonant cavity, with only limited fringing
radiation. Therefore, the bandwidth of the radiation is poor
compared to the bandwidth of antennas discussed earlier. The
small bandwidth, however, is adequate in a large class of com-
munication applications. Readers may refer to Balanis (1997)
and Carver and Mink (1981) for some analytical modeling of a
microstrip antenna. Simple and approximate expressions for
the radiated electric ﬁeld components of a microstrip antenna
are given by Carver and Mink (1981):
