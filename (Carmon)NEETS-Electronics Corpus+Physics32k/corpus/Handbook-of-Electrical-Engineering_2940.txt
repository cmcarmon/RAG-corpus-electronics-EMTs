The most widely used op amp macromodel that includes dc offset effects is the Boyle model [Boyle et al.,
1974].  Most  op  amp  manufacturers  use  this  model,  usually  with  additions  to  add  more  poles  (and  perhaps
zeroes). The various resistor and capacitor values, as well as transistor, and current and voltage generator, values
are intimately related to the speciÔ¨Åcations of the op amp, as shown earlier in the nonideal model of Fig. 27.3.
The appropriate equations are too involved to list here; instead, the interested reader is referred to the article
by  Boyle  in  the  listed  references.  The  Boyle  model  does  not  accurately  model  noise  effects,  nor  does  it  fully
model PSRR and CMRR effects.
