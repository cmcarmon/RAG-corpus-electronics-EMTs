Many factors affect sustain for a given instrument. For example, sustain in guitars is determined by factors including body construction (hollow versus solid), body woods, neck woods, the placing of strings (through the body or atop the body), string gauges and pickup design. Also, there are dedicated effects pedals for electric and bass guitars capable of prolonging the sustain-phase of a tone.
On acoustic pianos, pressing and holding down the sustain pedal (the rightmost of the two or three pedals at the base) lifts the dampers from the strings, allowing them to ring out even after the keys are lifted. A similar effect can be achieved with electronic musical instruments, such as digital pianos and synthesizers, by latching the envelopes of any currently playing or subsequently played notes at their sustain levels.
