A signal is any kind of physical quantity that conveys information. Audible speech is
certainly a kind of signal, as it conveys the thoughts (information) of one person to another
through the physical medium of sound. Hand gestures are signals, too, conveying information
by means of light. This text is another kind of signal, interpreted by your English-trained mind
as information about electric circuits. In this chapter, the word signal will be used primarily
in reference to an electrical quantity of voltage or current that is used to represent or signify
some other physical quantity.
