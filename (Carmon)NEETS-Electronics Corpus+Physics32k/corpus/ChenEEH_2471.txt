FIGURE 6.18 A Few Practical Antenna Geometries. (A) A waveguide horn antenna is excited from a waveguide input. (B) A Yagi-Uda array is
commonly used in television receivers, having an end Ô¨Åre and high-gain beam. (c) A spiral plate antenna is shown here with broad band
radiation along the broadside (z) direction.
