The purpose of the EXTREMELY LOW-FREQUENCY (elf) communications system is to send 
short "phonetic letter spelled out" (PLSO) messages from operating authorities in the continental United 
States (CONUS) to submarines operating at normal mission speeds and depths. Elf has the ability to 
penetrate ocean depths to several hundred feet with little signal loss. This ability allows submarines to be 
operated well below the immediate surface and enhances submarine survivability by making detection 
more difficult.
