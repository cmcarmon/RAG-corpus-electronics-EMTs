failure to take care in driving or operating a tow truck including losing or damaging a motor vehicle or its contents
leaving a tow truck standing at a road accident site in a manner or for a time which obstructs the road for an unnecessary period

Members of the Victoria Police and VicRoads' authorised officers are given power under the Act to direct a person to leave a restricted road accident site area (an area within a 500-metre radius of an accident damaged vehicle) if the person is causing an unwarranted obstruction to traffic, hindering efforts to attend to any injured persons or damaged property or is otherwise hindering or obstructing the orderly towing of a motor vehicle from a road accident site. A direction may be given to a tow truck driver, the holder of a tow truck licence or a person engaged in vehicle repair work or persons acting on behalf of those persons. It is an offence to fail to comply with a direction.
