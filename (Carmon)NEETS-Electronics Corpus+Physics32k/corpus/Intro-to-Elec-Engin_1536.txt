If the time delays of the signals from the master and a given slave are equal (i.e., no differential
delay), then the line of position is the perpendicular bisector of the line joining the master and
that particular slave. On the other hand, if the time delay from the master is smaller by a certain
amount, the line of position happens to be a hyperbola situated toward and near the master, as
illustrated by LOP for slave 1 in Figure 15.5.1, and LOP for slave 2, where the time delay from
slave 2 is smaller. The intersection of the LOPs for the two slaves determines the location of the
receiver.
