was a requirement across several dimensions. To provide sufﬁcient data security a wireless system should ﬁrst
prevent the effective capture of data by a receiver outside of the wireless system and, second, prevent capture
of  the  data  by  unauthorized  wireless  hardware  within  the  system.  A  wireless  product  must  be  secure  from
eavesdropping, either accidental or intentional.
