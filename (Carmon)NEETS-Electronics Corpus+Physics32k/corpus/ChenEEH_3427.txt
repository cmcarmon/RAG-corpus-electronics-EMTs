criteria for establishing the type and level of the difference that
are typical for a fault event are presented at a later time when
this relaying principle is discussed in more detail. In the case of
a differential protection of transmission lines, the measured
quantities need to be sent over a communication channel to
compute the difference. Since the speed and reliability of
communication channels may play a role in the overall per-
formance of the concept, slightly different philosophy is estab-
lished regarding the type of measurements taken and the
comparison criteria for the transmission lines versus other,
more local, applications.
