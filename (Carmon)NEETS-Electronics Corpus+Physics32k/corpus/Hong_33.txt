Switching  circuits  involving  inductors  have  a  rather  destructive  failure  mode. 
Suppose  that  in  the  circuit  shown  in  Figure  ###,  the  switch  is  opened  again  after  the 
current  flowing  through  the  inductor  has  reached  steady-state.  Since  the  current  is 
terminated abruptly, the derivative term of Eq. ### can be very high. High voltages can 
result  in  electrical  breakdown  which  can  permanently  damage  the  inductor  as  well  as 
other components in the circuit. This problem and appropriate remedies are discussed in 
more detail in section 18.2.
