Conversely, both Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits should generate the same amount
of current through a short circuit across the load terminals. With the Norton equivalent, the
short-circuit current would be exactly equal to the Norton source current, which is 14 amps
in this case. With the Thevenin equivalent, all 11.2 volts would be applied across the 0.8 â„¦
Thevenin resistance, producing the exact same current through the short, 14 amps (I=E/R).
Thus, we can say that the Norton current is equal to the Thevenin voltage divided by the
Thevenin resistance:
EThevenin
