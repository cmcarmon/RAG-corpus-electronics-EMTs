The curves shown in Fig. 22.5 were obtained for uniform semiconductors under steady-state conditions. Strictly
speaking, this is not the case with actual semiconductor devices, where velocity can “overshoot” the value shown
in Fig. 22.5. This effect is important for Si devices shorter than 0.1mm (0.25 mm for GaAs devices) [Shur, 1990;
Ferry, 1991]. In such extreme cases the drift-diffusion equation (22.9) is no longer adequate, and the analysis
is based on the Boltzmann transport equation
