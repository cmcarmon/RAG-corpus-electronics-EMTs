The common-emitter configuration provides a medium input impedance and a medium output 
impedance. The common-base configuration provides a low input impedance and a high output 
impedance. The common-collector configuration provides a high input impedance and a low output 
impedance. The common-collector configuration is often used to provide impedance matching between a 
high output impedance and a low input impedance.
