Consider particles described by f, each experiencing an external force F not due to other particles (see the collision term for the latter treatment).
Suppose at time t some number of particles all have position r within element

r




{\displaystyle d^{3}{\bf {r}}}
and momentum p within

p




{\displaystyle d^{3}{\bf {p}}}
. If a force F instantly acts on each particle, then at time t + Δt their position will be r + Δr = r + pΔt/m and momentum p + Δp = p + FΔt. Then, in the absence of collisions, f must satisfy

is constant, which can be shown using Hamilton's equations (see the discussion under Liouville's theorem). However, since collisions do occur, the particle density in the phase-space volume
