In this chapter, we introduced capacitors and inductors, and derived their
lumped element laws from more fundamental distributed physics. Since
those element laws involved time derivatives, or alternatively time inte-
grals, time became an important variable in this chapter. This was not the
case in previous chapters because the circuits we studied there contained
only sources, resistors, and idealized MOSFETs, all of which have purely
algebraic element laws. Because time was an important variable in this chap-
ter, we also began to consider a richer class of functions for the sources
that would input signals into a circuit. These functions included sinusoids,
steps, and impulses. The circuit responses to these inputs became our first
examples of transients in electronic circuits.
