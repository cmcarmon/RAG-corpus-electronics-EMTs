Fuses have identifications printed on them. The printing on the fuse will identify the physical size,
the type of fuse, and the fuse ratings. There are four different systems used to identify fuses. The systems
are the old military designation, the new military designation, the old commercial designation, and the
new commercial designation. All four systems are presented here, so you will be able to identify a fuse no
matter which designation is printed on the fuse.
