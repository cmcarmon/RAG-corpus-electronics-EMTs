where ns is the average number of photoelectrons generated by the signal during a single bit interval when a
binary 1 is received. An error rate of 10â€“9 or better requires about 21 photoelectrons per bit. Shot noise depends
on the optical signal level. Because the power level is normally low at the end of a long-distance system, the
shot noise is small compared to the thermal noise. Avalanche photodiodes increase the shot noise compared
to the thermal noise. With APD receivers, ideal shot-noise limited operation can be approached but (because
of the APD excess noise and limited gain) not reached.
