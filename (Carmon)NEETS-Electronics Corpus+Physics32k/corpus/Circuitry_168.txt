differentiator,  we  need  to  make  the  time  constant,  
C × R, very much less than the periodic time of the 
input waveform (1 ms). 
  Assuming that we choose a medium value for R
of, say, 10 kF, the maximum value which we could 
allow  C to  have  would  be  that  which  satisfies  the 
equation: 
 
C × R = 0.1 t 
 
where R = l0 kF and t = 1 ms. Thus
