This is the case where surface recombination can be ignored and the device thickness is much greater than the
minority carrier diffusion length. Unfortunately, surface recombination is an important factor in a number of
semiconductor materials, including silicon. Also, the minority carrier diffusion length can be greater than the
solar cell thickness. The equation for J0 then becomes the more formidable (see [Hovel, 1976] or [Fahrenbruch
and Bube, 1983]).
