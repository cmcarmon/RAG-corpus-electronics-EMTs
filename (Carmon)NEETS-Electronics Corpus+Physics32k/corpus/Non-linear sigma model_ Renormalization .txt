This model proved to be relevant in string theory where the two-dimensional manifold is named worldsheet. Appreciation of its generalized renormalizability was provided by Daniel Friedan. He showed that the theory admits a renormalization group equation, at the leading order of perturbation theory, in the form

Rab being the Ricci tensor of the target manifold.
This represents a Ricci flow, obeying Einstein field equations for the target manifold as a fixed point. The existence of such a fixed point is relevant, as it grants, at this order of perturbation theory, that conformal invariance is not lost due to quantum corrections, so that the quantum field theory of this model is sensible (renormalizable).
Further adding nonlinear interactions representing flavor-chiral anomalies results in the Wess–Zumino–Witten model, which augments the geometry of the flow to include torsion, preserving renormalizability and leading to an infrared fixed point as well, on account of teleparallelism ("geometrostasis").
