This chapter is a milestone in your study of electronics. Previous modules have been concerned more 
with individual components of circuits than with the complete circuits as the subject. This chapter and the 
other chapters of this module are concerned with the circuitry of amplifiers. While components are 
discussed, the discussion of the components is not an explanation of the working of the component itself 
(these have been covered in previous modules) but an explanation of the component as it relates to the 
circuit.
