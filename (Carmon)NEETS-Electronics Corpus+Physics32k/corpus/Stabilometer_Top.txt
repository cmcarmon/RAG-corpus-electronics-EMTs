A Stabilometer is a device for studying the mechanical properties of a soil under conditions of three-axis compression (stabilometry). It is the most advanced instrument for laboratory testing of soils, it can recreate the natural stress of the sample, according to the acting stresses and the pressure of the pore fluid.
Eurocode recommends four tests with the stabilometre. Two are field tests and two are laboratory tests. Afterwards calculations can be performed on the worst possible values.
