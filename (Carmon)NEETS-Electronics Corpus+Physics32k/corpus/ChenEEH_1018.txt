The UDSA can be interpreted as the probability that a useful
power consuming transition will occur during a single data
period. The calculation of this term is difÔ¨Åcult because it
depends on the input switching activity, logic function imple-
mented, and the spatial and temporal correlations among the
circuit inputs. Several attempts to estimate this switching ac-
tivity can be found in the literature (Najm, 1994).
