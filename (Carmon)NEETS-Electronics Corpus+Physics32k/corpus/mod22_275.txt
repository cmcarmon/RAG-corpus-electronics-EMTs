Another approach is a compromise between the programmer and computer. The programmer first 
writes instructions in a code that is easier to relate to English. This code is not the computer's language; 
therefore, the computer does not understand the orders. The programmer solves this problem by giving 
the computer another program, one that enables it to translate the instruction codes into its own language. 
This translation program, for example, would be equivalent to an English-to-French dictionary, leaving 
the translating job to be done by the computer.
