The basic structure of a shuttle valve is like a tube with three openings; one on each end, and one in the middle. A ball or other blocking valve element moves freely within the tube. When pressure from a fluid is exerted through an opening on one end it pushes the ball towards the opposite end. This prevents the fluid from traveling through that opening, but allows it to flow through the middle opening. In this way two different sources can provide pressure without the threat of back flow from one source to the other.
In pneumatic logic a shuttle-valve works as an OR gate.
