Laser printers direct a beam of light through a rotating disk containing the full range of print 
characters. The appropriate character image is directed onto photographic paper, which is then put 
through a toner, developed, and used to make additional copies. The print resulting from this process 
consists of sharp, clean images that are easy on the eyes. These printers can print up to 20,000 plus lines 
per minute, or 26,666 cps (characters per second).
