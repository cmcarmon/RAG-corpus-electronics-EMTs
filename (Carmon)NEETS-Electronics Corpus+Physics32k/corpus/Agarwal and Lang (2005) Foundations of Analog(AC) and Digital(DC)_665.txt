The analytical method uses KVL/KCL or the node method to write
the circuit equations and solves them directly. The graphical method uses
a graph of the v i relation of the nonlinear device and the graph capturing
the circuit constraint to solve for the operating point. The piecewise lin-
ear method represents the v i characteristics of a nonlinear element by a
succession of straight-line segments, then makes calculations within each
straight-line segment using linear analysis tools.
