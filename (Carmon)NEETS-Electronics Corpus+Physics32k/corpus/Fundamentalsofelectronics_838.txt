Here Q (·) is the integral Q (x) = 1√
x e−α2/2dα. This integral has no closed form expression, but it
can be accurately computed. As Figure 6.15 illustrates, Q (·) is a decreasing, very nonlinear function.
The term A2T equals the energy expended by the transmitter in sending the bit; we label this term Eb. We
arrive at a concise expression for the probability the matched ﬁlter receiver makes a bit-reception error when
the BPSK signal set is used.
