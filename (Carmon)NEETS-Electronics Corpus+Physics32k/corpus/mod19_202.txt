Rf connectors and coaxial cable assemblies are used to carry radio frequency (rf) power from one 
point to another with a known rate of loss. Rf connectors are available as plugs, jacks, panel jacks, and 
receptacles. Plugs and jacks are attached to the ends of coaxial cables; panel jacks and receptacles are 
mounted to panels and chassis.
