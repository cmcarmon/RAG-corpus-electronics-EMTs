FPGAs, by deﬁnition, are conﬁgurable; most of them are also
reconﬁgurable unless they are based on technologies such as
Antifuse, that are one-time programmable. Several commercial
devices support partial reconﬁguration, including the Virtex
(Xilinx, 2001) and 6200 (Churcher et al., 1995) devices from
Xilinx, the CLAy chip from National Semiconductor (National
Semiconductor, 1993), and the AT 40K devices from Ateml
(Atmel, 1997). Useful reviews of FPGA architectures are avail-
able (Buell et al., 1996; Hauck, 1998; Kean, 2000; Mangione-
Smith, 1997; Trumberger, 1994; Villasenor and Hutchings,
1998). Although some devices such as Xilinx 6200 FPGAs are
no longer supported commercially, the ideas in the relevant
publications may still inspire future advances.
