It is clear that errors due to inaccurate numerical velocities
are cumulative (i.e., they increase linearly with the wave-
propagation distance). These errors represent a fundamental
limitation of all grid-based Maxwell’s equations’ algorithms
and can be troublesome when modeling electrically large struc-
tures. A positive aspect seen in Figure 9.4 is that both D~vvphysical
and D~vvaniso decrease by approximately a 4:1 factor each time
the grid-sampling density doubles, indicative of the second-
order accuracy of the Yee algorithm. Therefore, ﬁner meshing
is one way to control the dispersion error.
