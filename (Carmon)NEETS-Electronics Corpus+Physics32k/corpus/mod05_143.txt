Stated very simply, a dc motor rotates as a result of two magnetic fields interacting with each other. 
The armature of a dc motor acts like an electromagnet when current flows through its coils. Since the 
armature is located within the magnetic field of the field poles, these two magnetic fields interact. Like 
magnetic poles repel each other, and unlike magnetic poles attract each other. As in the dc generator, the 
dc motor has field poles that are stationary and an armature that turns on bearings in the space between 
the field poles. The armature of a dc motor has windings on it just like the armature of a dc generator. 
These windings are also connected to commutator segments. A dc motor consists of the same components 
as a dc generator. In fact, most dc generators can be made to act as motors, and vice versa.
