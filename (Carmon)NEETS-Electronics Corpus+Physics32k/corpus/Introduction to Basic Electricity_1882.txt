To measure current, the selector switch is set for the 
desired current position and the meter is connected in 
series with the circuit. The DC scale on the meter is 
used. For the 1 mA range, use the 0–10 scale and di-
vide by 10. For the 10 mA range, use the 0–10 scale 
directly. For the 100 mA range, use the 0–10 scale and 
multiply by 10. For the 500 mA range, use the 0–50 
scale and multiply by 10.
