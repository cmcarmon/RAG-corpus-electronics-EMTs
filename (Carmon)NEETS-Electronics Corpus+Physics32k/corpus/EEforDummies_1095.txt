Making a custom circuit board
After you become experienced in the ways of designing and building electron-
ics projects, you may want to graduate to the big time and create your own 
custom circuit board, geared for a particular circuit design. You can make 
(yes, make) your very own custom PCB — just like the electronics manufac-
turers do. PCBs are reliable, rugged, allow for higher‐density circuits, and 
enable you to include non‐standard size components that may not fit in other 
types of circuit boards.
