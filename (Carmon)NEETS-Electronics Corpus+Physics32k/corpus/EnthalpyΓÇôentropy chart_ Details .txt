On the diagram, lines of constant pressure, constant temperature and volume are plotted, so in a two-phase region, the lines of constant pressure and temperature coincide. Thus, coordinates on the diagram represent entropy and heat.
The work done in a process on vapor cycles is represented by length of h, so it can be measured directly, whereas in a T–s diagram it has to be computed using thermodynamic relationship between thermodynamic properties.
In an isobaric process, the pressure remains constant, so the heat interaction is the change in enthalpy.
In an isenthalpic process, the enthalpy is constant. A horizontal line in the h–s chart represents an isenthalpic process.
A vertical line in the h–s chart represents an isentropic process. The process 3–4 in a Rankine cycle is isentropic when the steam turbine is said to be an ideal one. So the expansion process in a turbine can be easily calculated using the h–s chart when the process is considered to be ideal (which is the case normally when calculating enthalpies, entropies, etc. Later the deviations from the ideal values can be calculated considering the isentropic efficiency of the steam turbine used.)
Lines of constant dryness fraction (x), sometimes called the quality, are drawn in the wet region and lines of constant temperature are drawn in the superheated region. X gives the fraction (by mass) of gaseous substance in the wet region, the remainder being colloidal liquid droplets. Above the heavy line, the temperature is above the boiling point, and the dry (superheated) substance is gas only.
In general such charts do not show the values of specific volumes, nor do they show the enthalpies of saturated water at pressures which are of the order of those experienced in condensers in a thermal power station. Hence the chart is only useful for enthalpy changes in the expansion process of the steam cycle.
