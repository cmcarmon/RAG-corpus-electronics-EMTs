An instrument called a MEGOHMMETER (MEGGER) is used for these tests. The megger (fig.
1-36) is a portable instrument consisting of two primary elements: (1) a hand-driven dc generator, G,
which supplies the high voltage for making the measurement, and (2) the instrument portion, which
indicates the value of the resistance being measured. The instrument portion is of the opposed-coil type,
as shown in figure 1-36(A). Coils a and b are mounted on the movable member c with a fixed relationship
to each other, and are free to turn as a unit in a magnetic field. Coil b tends to move the pointer
counterclockwise, and coil a tends to move the pointer clockwise.
