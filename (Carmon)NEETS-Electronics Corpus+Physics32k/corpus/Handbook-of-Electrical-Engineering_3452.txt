The  successful  removal  of  these  heat  ﬂuxes,  in  the  presence  of  severe  electrical,  manufacturing  cost,  and
reliability constraints, poses a formidable challenge to the packaging community. Nevertheless, it must be noted
that the heat ﬂuxes encountered in today’s “cutting edge technology” chips already pose a signiﬁcant challenge
 to nearly
to the thermal packaging engineer. Chip heat ﬂuxes in the mid-1980s typically ranged from 5 W/cm
