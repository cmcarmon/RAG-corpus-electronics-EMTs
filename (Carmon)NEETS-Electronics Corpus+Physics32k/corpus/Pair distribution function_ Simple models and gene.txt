The simplest possible pair distribution function assumes that all object locations are mutually independent, giving:




g
(



r
→



)
=
1


{\displaystyle g({\vec {r}})=1}
,
where






r
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {r}}}
is the separation between a pair of objects. However, this is inaccurate in the case of hard objects as discussed above, because it does not account for the minimum separation required between objects. The hole-correction (HC) approximation provides a better model:




g
(
r
)
=


{



0
,


r
<
b
,




1
,


r
≥



b






,


{\displaystyle g(r)={\begin{cases}0,&r<b,\\1,&r\geq {}b\end{cases}},}

where



b


{\displaystyle b}
is the diameter of one of the objects.
Although the HC approximation gives a reasonable description of sparsely packed objects, it breaks down for dense packing. This may be illustrated by considering a box completely filled by identical hard balls so that each ball touches its neighbours. In this case, every pair of balls in the box is separated by a distance of exactly



r
=
n
b


{\displaystyle r=nb}
where



n


{\displaystyle n}
is a positive whole number. The pair distribution for a volume completely filled by hard spheres is therefore a set of Dirac delta functions of the form:




g
(
r
)
=

∑

i


δ
(
r
−
i
b
)


{\displaystyle g(r)=\sum \limits _{i}\delta (r-ib)}
.
Finally, it may be noted that a pair of objects which are separated by a large distance have no influence on each other's position (provided that the container is not completely filled). Therefore,





lim

r
→
∞


g
(
r
)
=
1


{\displaystyle \lim \limits _{r\to \infty }g(r)=1}
.
In general, a pair distribution function will take a form somewhere between the sparsely packed (HC approximation) and the densely packed (delta function) models, depending on the packing density
