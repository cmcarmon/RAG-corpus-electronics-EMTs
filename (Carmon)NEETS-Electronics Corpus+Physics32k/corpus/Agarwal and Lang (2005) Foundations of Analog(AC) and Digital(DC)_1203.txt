shown in
Figure 8.51. The input voltage vI comprises the sum of a DC bias voltage VI = 0.7 V
and a sinusoid of the form vi = A sin(Ï‰t), where A = 0.001 V. For the values shown,
you may assume that A is very small compared to VI. You may further assume that the
BJT always operates in its active region. Figure 8.52 shows a small-signal model for the
BJT operating in its active region. Let the output voltage vo comprise a DC bias term
VO and a small-signal response term vo.
a) Determine the output operating-point voltage VO for the input bias of VI = 0.7 V.
