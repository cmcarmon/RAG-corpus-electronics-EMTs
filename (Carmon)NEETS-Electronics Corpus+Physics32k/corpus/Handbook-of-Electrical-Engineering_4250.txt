As noted in the subsection “Radar Cross Section,” RCS ﬂuctuation effects must be considered in assessing
detection performance. The Swerling models which use chi-square probability density functions (PDFs) of 2
and 4 degrees of freedom (DOF) are commonly used for this purpose [Nathanson, 1991]. The Swerling 1 and
2 models are based on the 2 DOF PDF and can be derived by modeling the target as an ensemble of independent
scatterers of comparable magnitude. This model is considered representative of complex targets such as aircraft.
The Swerling 3 and 4 models use the 4 DOF PDF and correspond to a target with a single dominant scatterer
and  an  ensemble  of  lesser  scatterers.  Missiles  are  sometimes  represented  by  Swerling  2  and  4  models.  The
Swerling 1 and 3 models presuppose slow ﬂuctuation such that the target RCS is constant from pulse to pulse
within a scan. In contrast, the RCS of Swerling 2 and 4 targets is modeled as independent on a pulse to pulse basis.
Single-pulse detection probabilities for nonﬂuctuating, Swerling 1/2, and Swerling 3/4 targets are depicted
in Fig. 41.4. This curve is based on a typical false alarm number corresponding approximately to a false alarm
probability  of  10–6.  The  difference  in  S/N  required  for  a  given  detection  probability  for  a  ﬂuctuating  target
relative to the nonﬂuctuating case is termed the ﬂuctuation loss.
