If the transistor is unlisted or the number of the 
transistor is missing, the following procedure can be 
used to make an accurate replacement selection:
  1.  NPN or PNP? The first source of information 
is the symbol on the schematic diagram. If a 
 schematic is not available, the polarity of the 
 voltage source between the emitter and collector 
must be determined. If the collector voltage is 
positive with respect to the emitter voltage, then 
it is an NPN device. If the collector voltage is 
 negative with respect to the emitter voltage, then 
it is a PNP device. An easy way to remember the 
polarity of the collector voltage for each type of 
transistor is shown in Figure 31-9.
