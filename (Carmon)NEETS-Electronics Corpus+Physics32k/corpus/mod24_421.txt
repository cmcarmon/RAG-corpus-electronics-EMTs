An optical splitter is a passive device that splits the optical power carried by a single input fiber into
two output fibers. Figure 4-25 illustrates the transfer of optical power in an optical splitter. The input
optical power is normally split evenly between the two output fibers. This type of optical splitter is known
as a Y-coupler. However, an optical splitter may distribute the optical power carried by input power in an
uneven manner. An optical splitter may split most of the power from the input fiber to one of the output
fibers. Only a small amount of the power is coupled into the secondary output fiber. This type of optical
splitter is known as a T-coupler, or an optical tap.
