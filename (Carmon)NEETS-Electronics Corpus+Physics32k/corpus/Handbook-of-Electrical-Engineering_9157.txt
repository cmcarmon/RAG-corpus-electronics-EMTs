Contactless smart card readers are perfectly suited for physical access control and smart tracking applications.
The use of Smart Labels (or tags) injected or embedded into a product allows the identiÔ¨Åcation and tracking
of product for either authentication or automated manipulation. Since data can also be written into a contactless
card, payment functions can be implemented for fare collection in public transportation, for instance. When
the distance between communications is a concern, systems using intelligent transponders enable the payment
of tolls from equipped vehicles travelling on motorways at normal speed.
