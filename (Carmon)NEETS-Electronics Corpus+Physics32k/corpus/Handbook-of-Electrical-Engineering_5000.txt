where the left-hand side represents the heat transfer in J  s–1 along a length l (cm) of sectional area A (cm2) of
the dielectric surface in the direction of the temperature gradient due to the temperature difference DT, in (cid:176)C,
such  that  the  units  of  the  thermal  conductivity  constant  K  are  in  J  (cid:176)C  –1  cm–1  s–1.  The  right-hand  side  of
Eq. (55.18) is equal to the dielectric loss dissipated in the dielectric in J s–1, where E is the external ﬁeld, e¢ the
real value of the permittivity, and tand the dissipation factor at the radial frequency v.
