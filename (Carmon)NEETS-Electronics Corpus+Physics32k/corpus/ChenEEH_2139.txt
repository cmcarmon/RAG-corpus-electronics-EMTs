In this linear equation, s0 is the conductivity at temperature
T0, a is the temperature coefÔ¨Åcient of the conductor (see Table
1.1), and s is the conductivity at temperature T . For metals
with a positive a, the conductivity decreases with increasing T
(or resistivity  1=s increases with increasing T ).
