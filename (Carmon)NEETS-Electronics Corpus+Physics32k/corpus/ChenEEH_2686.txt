Surface-Fitted
In this case, the space lattice is globally distorted to Ô¨Åt the
shape of the structure of interest. The lattice can be divided
into multiple zones to accommodate a set of distinct surface
features (Shankar et al., 1990). The major advantage of this
approach is that well-developed mesh-generation software of
this type is available. The major disadvantage, relative to the
Yee algorithm, is the substantial added computer burden due
to:
