The transmembrane potential is stable in inexcitable cells, such as the red blood cell. However, in excitable
cells, a reduction in transmembrane potential (either physiological or induced electrically) results in excitation,
characterized by a transmembrane ion ï¬‚ux, resulting from a membrane permeability change. When the trans-
membrane potential is reduced by about one-third, Na+ ions rush in; K+ ions exit slightly later while the cell
depolarizes, reverse polarizes, then repolarizes. The resulting excursion in transmembrane potential is a prop-
agated action potential that is characteristic for each type of cell. In Fig. 113.10 are shown the action potentials
of (A) a single cardiac ventricular muscle cell, (C) a skeletal muscle cell, and (E) a nerve cell. In (B) and (D),
the  ensuing  muscular  contractions  are  shown.  An  important  property  of  the  action  potential  is  that  it  is
propagated without decrement over the entire surface of the cell, the depolarized region being the stimulus for
adjacent polarized regions. In contractile cells it is the action potential that triggers release of mechanical energy
as shown in Figs. 113.10(B) and (D).
