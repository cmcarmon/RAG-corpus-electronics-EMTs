A lumped element or a discrete circuit part can normally be
realized with a much smaller size than its distributed or trans-
mission-line parameter counterpart. At lower microwave fre-
quencies, a size reduction to l=10 or less is possible. Therefore,
lumped elements are used to miniaturize passive circuit com-
ponents and also reduce losses as well as cost. Almost all of the
low (usually megahertz to lower gigahertz range) radio fre-
quency (RF) electronic components are in lumped-element
form. At higher microwave frequencies and, in particular, at
millimeter wavelengths, the loss of lumped elements becomes
prohibitive for discrete circuit design and is therefore typically
limited to special applications, such as in monolithic micro-
wave integrated circuits (MMICS) (Robertson, 1995). In these
applications, geometrical factors, dispersion, and, of course,
losses must be taken into account. In addition, the variation of
lumped-element values is often limited by structural topology,
material, operating frequency, and manufacturing process.
