Plasmon coupling is a reaction that occurs when two or more plasmonic particles approach each other to a distance below approximately one diameterâ€™s length. Upon the occurrence of plasmon coupling, the resonance of individual particles start to hybridize, and their resonance spectra peak wavelength will redshift. The magnitude of the spectra redshift is dependent on the interparticle gap as well as the agglomeration states. A larger redshift is usually associated with smaller interparticle gap and larger cluster size.
Plasmon coupling can also cause the electric field in the interparticle gap to be boosted by several orders of magnitude, which far-exceeds the field enhancement for a single plasmonic nanoparticle. Many sensing applications such as surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) utilize the plasmon coupling between nanoparticles to achieve ultralow detection limit.
