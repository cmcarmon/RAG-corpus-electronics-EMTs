Music is stored on a phonograph record in a continuous groove that spirals into the center of the 
record. But there are no grooves on a magnetic disk. Instead, data is stored on all disks in a number of 
invisible concentric circles called tracks. Each track has a designated number beginning with track 000 at 
the outer edge of the disk. The numbering continues sequentially toward the center to track 199, 800, or 
whatever the highest track number is. No track ever touches another (fig. 2-7). The number of tracks can 
vary from 35 to 77 on a floppy disk surface and from 200 to over 800 on hard disk surfaces.
