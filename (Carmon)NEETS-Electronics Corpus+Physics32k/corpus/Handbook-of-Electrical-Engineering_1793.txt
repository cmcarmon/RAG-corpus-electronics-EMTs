Subband Coding
Recently,  subband  coding  has  proved  to  be  an  effective  technique  for  image  compression.  Here,  the  original
video signal is Ô¨Åltered into a set of bandpass signals (subbands), each sampled at successively lower rates. This
process is known as the subband analysis stage. Each of the bandpass images is then quantized and encoded
for transmission/storage. At the receiver, the signals must be decoded and then an image reconstructed from
the  subbands.  The  process  at  the  receiver  is  referred  to  as  the  subband  synthesis  stage. A  one-level  subband
