Polyesters are obtained most commonly by reacting a dialcohol with a diester; they may be either thermo-
setting or thermoplastic. The former are usually employed in glass laminates and glass-Ô¨Åber-reinforced mold-
ings, while thermoplastic polyesters are used for injection-molding applications. They are used in small and
large electrical apparatus as well as in electronic applications.
