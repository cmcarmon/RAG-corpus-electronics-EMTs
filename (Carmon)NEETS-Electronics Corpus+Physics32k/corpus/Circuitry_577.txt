Square wave generators 
 
Because  the  high  time  (ton) is  always  greater  than 
the low time (toff), the mark to space ratio produced 
by a 555 timer can never be made equal to (or less 
than) unity. This could be a problem if we need to 
produce  a  precise  square  wave  in  which  ton  =  toff.
However, by making R2 very much larger than R1,
the  timer  can  be  made  to  produce  a  reasonably 
symmetrical  square  wave  output  (note  that  the 
minimum recommended value for R2 is 1 kK â€”see 
earlier).
