The primary harmonic distortion in magnetic tape recorder systems is third-order harmonics. If the
level of third-order harmonics in a recorder increases, the level of distortion will also increase (figures
6-4A and B show this relationship). Two things that determine the level of third-order harmonics in a
recorder are (1) the signal bias level, and (2) the record level. Figure 6-4A shows how third-order
harmonic distortion decreases as the signal bias level increases. Figure 6-4B shows how the third
harmonic increases gradually at first and then abruptly as the record level increases. Thatâ€™s why the third
harmonic is used to determine the normal record level.
