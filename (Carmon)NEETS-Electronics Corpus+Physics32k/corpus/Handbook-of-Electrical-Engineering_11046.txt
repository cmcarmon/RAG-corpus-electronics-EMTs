Instrumentation
The American  EEG  Society  [1986]  published  guidelines  for  the  performance  of  EEG  machines.  The  guidelines
recommended a minimum of eight channels. Chlorided silver disks or gold electrodes, adhered to the scalp with
collodion,  are  recommended;  needle  electrodes  are  not.  A  chart  speed  of  3  cm/s  is  standard,  and  a  recording
sensitivity of 5 to 10 mV/mm is recommended. The frequency response extends from 1 to 70 Hz for the â€“3-dB points.
Evoked Potentials
With the availability of signal averaging using a digital computer, it is possible to investigate the integrity of
the neural pathways from peripheral sense organs to the cortex by using appropriate stimuli (e.g., clicks, light
