Special mechanical arrangements must be provided when making electrical connections to
the rotating member. Such connections are usually made through carbon brushes bearing on either
a slip ring or a commutator, mounted on—but insulated from—the rotor shaft and rotating with
the rotor. A slip ring is a continuous ring, usually made of brass, to which only one electrical
connection is made. For example, two slip rings are used to supply direct current to the ﬁeld
winding on the rotor of a synchronous machine. A commutator, on the other hand, is a mechanical
switch consisting of a cylinder formed of hard-drawn copper segments separated and insulated
from each other by mica.
