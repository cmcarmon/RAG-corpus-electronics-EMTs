Although there are minor variations possible with this terminal strip circuit, the choice of
connections shown in this example sequence is both electrically accurate (electrically identical
to the schematic diagram) and carries the additional beneÔ¨Åt of not burdening any one screw
terminal on the strip with more than two wire ends, a good practice in any terminal strip
circuit.
