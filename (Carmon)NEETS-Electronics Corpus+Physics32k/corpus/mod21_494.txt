An analysis of a complex waveform, prepared in terms of a graphic plot of the amplitude versus 
frequency, is known as SPECTRUM ANALYSIS. Spectrum analysis recognizes the fact that waveforms 
are composed of the summation of a group of sinusoidal waves, each of an exact frequency and all 
existing together simultaneously.
