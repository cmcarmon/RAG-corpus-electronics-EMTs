These two fundamental ways of adding dielectric regions
inside a capacitor can be used to determine the capacitance
of arbitrarily ﬁlled capacitors, as long as the path taken by the
lines of ﬂux can be recognized. Thus, the partially ﬁlled coaxial
cylindrical capacitors of Figure 2.10 have the following capaci-
tances per unit length
