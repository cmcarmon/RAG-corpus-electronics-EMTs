In this article we will lay out the conceptual basis for optical data storage systems; the emphasis will be on
disk technology in general and magneto-optical disk in particular. The ﬁrst section is devoted to a discussion
of some elementary aspects of disk data storage including the concept of track and deﬁnition of the access time.
The second section describes the basic elements of the optical path and its functions; included are the properties
of the semiconductor laser diode, characteristics of the beamshaping optics, and certain features of the focusing
objective lens. Because of the limited depth of focus of the objective and the eccentricity of tracks, optical disk
systems  must  have  a  closed-loop  feedback  mechanism  for  maintaining  the  focused  spot  on  the  right  track.
These mechanisms are described in the third and fourth sections for automatic focusing and automatic track
following,  respectively.  The  physical  process  of  thermomagnetic  recording  in  magneto-optic  (MO)  media  is
described  next,  followed  by  a  discussion  of  the  MO  readout  process  in  the  sixth  section.  The  ﬁnal  section
describes the properties of the MO media.
