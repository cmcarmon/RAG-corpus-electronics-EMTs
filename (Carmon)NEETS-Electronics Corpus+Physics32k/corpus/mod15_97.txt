A torque transmitter (TX) and a torque receiver (TR) make up a simple torque-synchro system. 
Basically, the electrical construction of synchro transmitters and receivers is similar, but their intended 
functions are different. The rotor of a synchro transmitter is usually geared to a manual or mechanical 
input. This gearing may drive a visual indicator showing the value or quantity being transmitted. The 
rotor of the receiver synchronizes itself electrically with the position of the rotor of the transmitter and 
thus responds to the quantity being transmitted.
