rank Sprague was a true entrepreneur in
the  new  ﬁeld  of  electrical  technology.
After  a  brief  stint  on  Thomas  Edison’s
staff,  Sprague  went  out  on  his  own,  founding
Sprague  Electric  Railway  and  Motor  Company
in  1884.  In  1887,  Sprague  equipped  the  ﬁrst
modern  trolley  railway  in  the  United  States.
Sprague’s  successful  construction  of  a  streetcar
system for Richmond, Virginia, in 1888 was the
beginning  of  the  great  electric  railway  boom.
Sprague followed this system with 100 other such
systems, both in America and Europe, during the
next two years. In less than 15 years, more than
20,000 miles (32,000 km) of electric street rail-
way were built.
