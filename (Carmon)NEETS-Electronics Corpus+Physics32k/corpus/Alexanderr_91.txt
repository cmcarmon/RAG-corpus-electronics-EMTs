up with a purely resistive circuit. Since it is composed of deltas
and wyes, we have a more complex process of combining the
elements together. We can use wye-delta transformations as one
approach to Ô¨Ånd a solution. It is useful to locate the wyes (there
are two of them, one at n and the other at c) and the deltas
(there are three: can, abn, cnb).
