A Pitot-tube is a pressure measuring instrument used to measure fluid flow velocity by determining the stagnation pressure and static pressure. While it is not suitable for measuring velocity in a turbulent flow, it determines the velocity profile by measuring the difference between total, static and dynamic pressure. Bernoulli's equation used to calculate the dynamic pressure and hence fluid velocity. Also see Air flow meter.
