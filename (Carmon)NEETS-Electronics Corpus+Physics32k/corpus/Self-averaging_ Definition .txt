Frequently in physics one comes across situations where quenched randomness plays an important role. Any physical property X of such a system, would require an averaging over all disorder realisations. The system can be completely described by the average [X] where [...] denotes averaging over realisations (“averaging over samples”) provided the relative variance RX = VX / [X]2 → 0 as N→∞, where VX = [X2] − [X]2 and N denotes the size of the realisation. In such a scenario a single large system is sufficient to represent the whole ensemble. Such quantities are called self-averaging. Away from criticality, when the larger lattice is built from smaller blocks, then due to the additivity property of an extensive quantity, the central limit theorem guarantees that RX ~ N−1 thereby ensuring self-averaging. On the other hand, at the critical point, the question whether



X


{\displaystyle X}
is self-averaging or not becomes nontrivial, due to long range correlations.
