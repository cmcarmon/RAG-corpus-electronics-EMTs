codewords in the example (7,4) code. The second results when the ﬁrst one experiences three bit errors
(ﬁrst, second, and sixth bits). Such an error pattern cannot be detected by our coding strategy, but such
multiple error patterns are very unlikely to occur. Our receiver uses the principle of maximum probability:
An error-free transmission is much more likely than one with three errors if the bit-error probability pe is
small enough.
