A time scale (or measure chain) is a closed subset of the real line




R



{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }
. The common notation for a general time scale is




T



{\displaystyle \mathbb {T} }
.
The two most commonly encountered examples of time scales are the real numbers




R



{\displaystyle \mathbb {R} }
and the discrete time scale



h

Z



{\displaystyle h\mathbb {Z} }
.
A single point in a time scale is defined as:




t
:

{\displaystyle t:t\in \mathbb {T} }
