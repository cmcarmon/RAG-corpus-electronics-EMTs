B = µH
where µ stands for the permeability of the material expressed in henrys per meter (H/m). The free-
space permeability µ0 is a constant given by 4π × 10
−7H/m in the SI system of units. The same
value holds good for air as well as for any nonmagnetic material. For a linear magnetic material
which exhibits a straight-line relationship between B and H, the permeability is a constant given
by the slope of the linear B–H characteristic, and it is related to the free-space permeability as
