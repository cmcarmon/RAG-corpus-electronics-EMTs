Large  DRAM  integrated  circuit  chips  frequently  provide  other  features  that  users  may  Ô¨Ånd  useful.  Faster
access is provided between certain adjacent addresses, usually along a common word line. Some designs feature
on-chip  buffer  memories,  low  standby  power  modes,  or  error  correction  circuitry.  A  few  DRAM  chips  are
designed to mesh with the constraints of particular applications such as image support for CRT displays. Some
on-chip features are effectively hidden from the user. These may include redundant memory addresses which
the maker activates by laser to improve manufacturing yield.
