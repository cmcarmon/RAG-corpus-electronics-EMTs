While pH can be measured by color changes in certain chemical powders (the ”litmus strip”
being a familiar example from high school chemistry classes), continuous process monitoring
and control of pH requires a more sophisticated approach. The most common approach is the
use of a specially-prepared electrode designed to allow hydrogen ions in the solution to migrate
through a selective barrier, producing a measurable potential (voltage) difference proportional
to the solution’s pH:
