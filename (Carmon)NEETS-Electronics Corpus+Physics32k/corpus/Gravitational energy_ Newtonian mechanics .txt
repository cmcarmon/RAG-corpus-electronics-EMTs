In classical mechanics, two or more masses always have a gravitational potential. Conservation of energy requires that this gravitational field energy is always negative. The gravitational potential energy is the potential energy an object has because it is within a gravitational field.
The force on point mass

is given by Newton's law of gravitation:

{\displaystyle F=G{\frac {mM}{r^{2}}}}

To get the total work done by an external force to bring point mass
