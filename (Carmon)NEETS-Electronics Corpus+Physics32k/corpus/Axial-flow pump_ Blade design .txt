In an axial flow pump, blades have an airfoil section over which the fluid flows and pressure is developed. For a constant flow, we have

{\displaystyle V_{\rm {f1}}=V_{\rm {f2}}=V_{\rm {f}}}

So, the maximum energy transfer to the fluid per unit weight will be

{\displaystyle U{\frac {(U-V_{\rm {f}}\cot \beta _{\rm {2}})}{g}}}

For constant energy transfer over the entire span of the blade, the above equation should be constant for all values of

{\displaystyle r}
. But,

{\displaystyle U^{2}}
will increase with an increase in radius

, therefore to maintain a constant value an equal increase in

{\displaystyle UV_{\rm {f}}\cot \beta _{\rm {2}}}

{\displaystyle \cot \beta _{\rm {2}}}
must increase on increasing



r


{\displaystyle r}
. So, the blade is twisted as the radius changes.
