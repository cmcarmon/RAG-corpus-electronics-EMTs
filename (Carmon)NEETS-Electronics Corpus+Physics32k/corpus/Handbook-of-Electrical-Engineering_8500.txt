Computer architecture can be deﬁned here to mean the functional operation of the individual hardware units
in a computer system and the ﬂow of information and control among them. This is a somewhat more general
deﬁnition than is sometimes used. For example, some articles and books refer to instruction set architecture
or the system bus architecture.
