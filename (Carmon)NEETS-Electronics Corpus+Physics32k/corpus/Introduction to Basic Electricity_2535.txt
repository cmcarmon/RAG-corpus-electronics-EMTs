the signal being measured. The gate control acts as the 
synchronization center of the counter. It controls the 
opening and closing of the main gate and also pro-
vides a signal to latch (lock onto) the count at the end 
of the counting period and reset the circuitry for the 
next count. The decade counter keeps a running tally 
of all the pulses that pass through the main gate. One 
decade counter is required for each digit displayed.  
The display, which provides a visual readout of the 
 frequency being measured, can be of several types. 
The more common displays are gas-discharge tubes; 
 light-emitting diode displays (LEDs), and liquid 
 crystal displays (LCDs).
