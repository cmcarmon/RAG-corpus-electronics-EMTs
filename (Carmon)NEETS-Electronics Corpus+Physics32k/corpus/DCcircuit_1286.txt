Equivalent circuit: Since the plates in a capacitor have some resistance, and since no di-
electric is a perfect insulator, there is no such thing as a ”perfect” capacitor. In real life, a
capacitor has both a series resistance and a parallel (leakage) resistance interacting with its
purely capacitive characteristics:
