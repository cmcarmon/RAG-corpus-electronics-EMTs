Since there is only acceleration in the vertical direction, the velocity in the horizontal direction is constant, being equal to

θ


{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} _{0}\cos \theta }
. The vertical motion of the projectile is the motion of a particle during its free fall. Here the acceleration is constant, being equal to g. The components of the acceleration are-
