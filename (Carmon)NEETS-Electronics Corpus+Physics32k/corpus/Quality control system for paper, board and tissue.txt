Sensors measuring the paper quality (online meters) are attached to a sensor platform that move across the web guided by the scanner beam. A typical crossing time for a sensor platform is 10â€“30 s (an 8 m web, 60 cm/s). The sensor platform scans across the paper web and continuously measures paper characteristics from edge to edge. It can also be directed and stopped to a specific, fixed point on the web to measure the machine-direction (MD) variation at a single point.
