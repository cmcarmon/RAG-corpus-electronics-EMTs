Given their greater distance from Earth, the known irregular satellites of Uranus and Neptune are larger than those of Jupiter and Saturn; smaller ones probably exist but have not yet been observed. However, with this observational bias in mind, the size distribution is similar for all four giant planets.
Typically, the relation expressing the number



N




{\displaystyle N\,\!}
of objects of the diameter smaller or equal to



D




{\displaystyle D\,\!}
is approximated by a power law:

q




{\displaystyle {\frac {dN}{dD}}\sim D^{-q}}
with q defining the slope.
A shallow power law (q~2) is observed for sizes 10 to 100 km† but steeper (q~3.5) for objects smaller than 10 km‡ .
For comparison, the distribution of Kuiper belt objects is much steeper (q~4), i.e. for one object of 1000 km there are a thousand objects with a diameter of 100 km. The size distribution provides insights into the possible origin (capture, collision/break-up or accretion).
†For every object of 100 km, ten objects of 10 km can be found.‡For one object of 10 km, some 140 objects of 1 km can be found.
