The conventional antenna is a conductor, or system of conductors, that radiates or intercepts 
electromagnetic wave energy. An ideal antenna has a definite length and a uniform diameter, and is 
completely isolated in space. However, this ideal antenna is not realistic. Many factors make the design of 
an antenna for a communications system a more complex problem than you would expect. These factors 
include the height of the radiator above the earth, the conductivity of the earth below it, and the shape and 
dimensions of the antenna. All of these factors affect the radiated-field pattern of the antenna in space. 
Another problem in antenna design is that the radiation pattern of the antenna must be directed between 
certain angles in a horizontal or vertical plane, or both.
