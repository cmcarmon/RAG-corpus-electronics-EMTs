The major differences between magnetic tape units are the speed at which the tape is moved past the 
read/write head and the density of the recorded information. You know that density describes the number 
of binary digits, bytes, or frames we can record on an inch of tape. The most common tape densities are 
800 and 1,600 BPI (or FPI). Tape speed (or tape movement) varies to a great extent, from less than 50 
inches per second to more than 100 inches per second. How fast a tape unit reads and writes is specified 
as the character transfer rate which is calculated by multiplying the speed of the magnetic tape unit by the 
character density.
