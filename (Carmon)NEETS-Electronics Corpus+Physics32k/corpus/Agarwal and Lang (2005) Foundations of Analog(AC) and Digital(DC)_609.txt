The behavior of this piecewise linear model can be summarized in two
statements, one for each of the segments:
Diode ON (short circuit): vD = 0
Diode OFF (open circuit): iD = 0
We now use the diode model comprising two straight-line segments to
illustrate the piecewise linear analysis method applied to the circuit in Figure 4.16
(also shown in Figure 4.24a). In particular, we will determine the voltage vR
across the resistor and the current iD through the resistor for two values of the
input voltage, E = 3 V and E = âˆ’5 V, and given that R = 500 .
