Table 5.3.1 lists some representative op-amp parameters for different ampliﬁer types, only
to illustrate their characteristics. One can see from the table that a high-power op amp can deliver
a large output current, but has relatively large offset parameters. On the other hand, a precision
input ampliﬁer has low offset and high gain, but at the price of bandwidth, slew rate, and output
current. The general-purpose ampliﬁer, as the name suggests, strikes a balance between these
extremes.
