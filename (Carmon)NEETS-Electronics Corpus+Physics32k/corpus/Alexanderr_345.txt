â–  METHOD 1 The  equivalent  resistance  is  the  same  as  the
Thevenin resistance at the inductor terminals. Because of the depend-
ent  source,  we  insert  a  voltage  source  with 
at  the  inductor
terminals  a-b,  as  in  Fig.  7.14(a).  (We  could  also  insert  a  1-A current
source at the terminals.) Applying KVL to the two loops results in
