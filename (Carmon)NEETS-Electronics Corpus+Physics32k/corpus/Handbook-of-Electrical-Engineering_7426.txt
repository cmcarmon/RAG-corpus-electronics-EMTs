The industrial telemetry receiving station differs vastly in purpose and principle from the transmitting station.
Its usual environment is no more difÔ¨Åcult to cope with, in terms of ambient temperature, shock, and vibrations,
than an automobile radio. It receives signals over relatively short distances in which the subcarrier frequencies
are so widely spaced that harmonics and drift are no problem.
