For lines longer than 50 miles, up to around 150 miles,
capacitance can no longer be neglected. A reasonable circuit
model is to simply split the total capacitance evenly with each
half represented as a shunt capacitor at each end of the line.
This is depicted as the pâ€“circuit model in Figure 7.7. Again,
the total capacitance is simply the per unit distance capacitance
times the line length:
