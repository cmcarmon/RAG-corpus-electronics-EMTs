Equation  (53.6)  reveals  that  the  superelectrons’  inertia  creates  a  lag  between  their  motion  and  that  of  an
applied electric ﬁeld. As a result, a superconductor will support a time-varying voltage drop. The impedance
 as a kinetic inductance
associated with the supercurrent is therefore inductive and it will be useful to think of 
created by the correlated motion of the Cooper pairs.
