This energy is conducted along a transmission line to the radar antenna. It is radiated by the antenna
into space. When this transmitter energy strikes one or more reflecting objects in its path, some of the
transmitted energy is reflected back to the antenna as echo pulses. Echo pulses from three reflecting
targets at different ranges are illustrated in figure 2-1. These echoes are converted to the corresponding
receiver output signals as shown in the figure. The larger initial and final pulses in the receiver output
signal are caused by the energy that leaks through the duplexer when a pulse is being transmitted.
