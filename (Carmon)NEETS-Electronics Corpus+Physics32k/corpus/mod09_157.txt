It is often necessary to state the band of frequencies that a circuit will pass. The following standard 
has been set up: the limiting frequencies are those at either side of resonance at which the curve falls to a 
point of .707 (approximately 70 percent) of the maximum value. This point is called the HALF-POWER 
point. Note that in figure 1-12, the series-resonant circuit has two half-power points, one above and one
