A second problem with switch-based services has been that a single service sometimes behaves differently
in different switch types. For example, the speed calling access patterns are different in various stored-program
control switches. The public is not particularly sensitive to this fact, because speed calling is not associated with
an individual but rather an individualâ€™s station set. People live in a mobile society, however, and they want to
have their services available from any station set and have them behave the same from any station set.
