When atoms are joined by chemical bonds, they form materials with unique properties
known as molecules. The dual-atom picture shown above is an example of a simple molecule
formed by two atoms of the same type. Most molecules are unions of different types of atoms.
Even molecules formed by atoms of the same type can have radically different physical proper-
ties. Take the element carbon, for instance: in one form, graphite, carbon atoms link together
to form ﬂat ”plates” which slide against one another very easily, giving graphite its natural
lubricating properties. In another form, diamond, the same carbon atoms link together in
a different conﬁguration, this time in the shapes of interlocking pyramids, forming a mate-
rial of exceeding hardness. In yet another form, Fullerene, dozens of carbon atoms form each
molecule, which looks something like a soccer ball. Fullerene molecules are very fragile and
lightweight. The airy soot formed by excessively rich combustion of acetylene gas (as in the
initial ignition of an oxy-acetylene welding/cutting torch) contains many Fullerene molecules.
