Because the most important feature of the parametric amplifier is the low-noise characteristic, the 
nature of ELECTRONIC NOISE and the effect of this type of noise on receiver operation must first be 
discussed. Electronic noise is the primary limitation on receiver sensitivity and is the name given to very 
small randomly fluctuating voltages that are always present in electronic circuits. The sensitivity limit of 
the receiver is reached when the incoming signal falls below the level of the noise generated by the 
receiver circuits. At this point the incoming signal is hidden by the noise, and further amplification has no 
effect because the noise is amplified at the same rate as the signal. The effects of noise can be reduced by 
careful circuit design and control of operating conditions, but it cannot be entirely eliminated. Therefore, 
circuits such as the parametric amplifier are important developments in the fields of communication and 
radar.
