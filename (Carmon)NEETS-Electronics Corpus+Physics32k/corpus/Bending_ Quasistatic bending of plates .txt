The defining feature of beams is that one of the dimensions is much larger than the other two. A structure is called a plate when it is flat and one of its dimensions is much smaller than the other two. There are several theories that attempt to describe the deformation and stress in a plate under applied loads two of which have been used widely. These are
the Kirchhoff–Love theory of plates (also called classical plate theory)
the Mindlin–Reissner plate theory (also called the first-order shear theory of plates)
