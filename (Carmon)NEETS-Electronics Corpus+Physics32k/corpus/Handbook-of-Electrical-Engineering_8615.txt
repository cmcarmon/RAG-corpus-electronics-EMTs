it is all just a list of bytes. You may access them two at a time, four at a time, or one at a time. Any interpretation
of those bytes is entirely up to the program. Unlike the HLL which requires that you tell it what each named
variable  is,  assembly  language  knows  only  bytes  and  groups  of  bytes.  In  assembly  language,  the “T”  can  be
thought of as a letter or the number 54 (HEX). Your choice. Or, more importantly, your program’s choice.
