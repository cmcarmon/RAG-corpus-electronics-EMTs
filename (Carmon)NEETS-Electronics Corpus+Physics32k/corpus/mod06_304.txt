First, no direct path exists between the cathode and the plate. Electrons leaving the cathode must run
an obstacle course around the grid wires to reach the plate. Some of these electrons are deflected by the
grid and scattered and, thus, never reach the plate. Second, some electrons strike the grid wires and are
removed from the electron stream as grid current. Because of these two undesirable effects, the amount of
plate current that can flow through the tube is greatly reduced. Because of this loss of electrons from the
stream, conventional tetrodes and pentodes are not suitable for power amplifiers. Therefore, a special
class of tubes has been developed to overcome this problemâ€”the BEAM POWER TUBES and
POWER PENTODE TUBES.
