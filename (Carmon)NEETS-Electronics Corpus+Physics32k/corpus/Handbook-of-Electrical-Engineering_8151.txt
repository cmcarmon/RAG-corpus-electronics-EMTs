The Electrostatic Deﬂection System
An  electrostatic  deﬂection  system  (Fig. 83.21)  consists  of  two  sets  of  metal  plates  of  length  l  symmetrically
located with respect to the electron beam axis at a distance d of each other. At the anode outlet aperture (at
potential V0),  the  beam  enters  the  deﬂection  plates  whose  potentials  are,  respectively, V0  + VD, V0  – VD.  The
deﬂection angle a at the exit of plates is such that
