The acceleration phase is initiated once the projectile begins its forward motion, which is also about the same time as the stride foot makes contact with the ground. The acceleration phase is the most explosive part of the overhead throwing motion, as the projectileâ€™s velocity increases from zero to its maximum velocity in this short amount of time. The ball is brought forward while the thrower's body rotates towards the target starting from the stride foot, moving up to the pelvis, followed by the trunk and spinal rotation, and then up to the shoulders. Although not visibly obvious, trunk muscular control is an important factor in high velocity throwing  During this phase the thrower's trunk will tilt to the side opposite the throwing arm to allow for greater distance of acceleration, which transfers more energy to the projectile. The acceleration phase ends at the time of the projectile's release from the hand, at which point it has attained its maximum velocity.
