The resistance-ratio bridge, shown in figure 3-1, may be used to measure capacitance, inductance, or 
resistance so long as the electronic part to be measured is compared with a similar standard. The 
measurement of the value of a capacitor must be made in terms of another capacitor of known 
characteristics, termed the STANDARD CAPACITOR. The same requirement is necessary for an 
inductance measurement. The standard of comparison is designated as XX, and the losses of the standard 
are represented as R X. If you experience difficulty in obtaining a balanced bridge condition, insert
