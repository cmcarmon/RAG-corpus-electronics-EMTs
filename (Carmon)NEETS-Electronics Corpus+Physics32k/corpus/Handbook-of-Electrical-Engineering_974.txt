It is an evolving model, so perhaps it is unfair to criticize it at this early stage. Its greatest shortcoming is,
again, the inability to ﬁt well over a wide range of geometries. It is hoped that future modiﬁcations will address
this  problem.  In  all  fairness,  however,  it  is  a  large  order  to  ask  a  model  to  be  physically  based,  have  not  too
many parameters, be well behaved for all default values of the parameters, ﬁt well over temperature, ﬁt Gds, ﬁt
over a wide range of geometries, and still ﬁt individual geometries as well as a model with over 100 parameters,
such as BSIM2. Some of these features were compromised in developing BSIM3.
