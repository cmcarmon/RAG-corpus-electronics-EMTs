node is the heart’s natural pacemaker. It is part of the atrioventricular (AV) conduction system, which serves
to distribute the wavefronts throughout the heart and to connect the otherwise electrically isolated atria and
ventricles. A normal depolarization wave spreads across the atria causing them to contract ﬁrst, and then, after
a brief delay while traversing the AV conduction system, across the ventricles causing them to contract shortly
thereafter. With  such  a  demanding,  complex  organ,  it  is  no  wonder  there  are  multiple  ways  by  which  it  can
fail. Failures in the electrical system, known as arrhythmias, may impair the contraction sequence and com-
promise blood ﬂow. These failures are often the result of some underlying heart disease, but may also have a
genetic  etiology. While  antiarrhythmic  drugs  have  been  available  for  some  time,  contemporary  treatment  of
arrhythmias relies heavily on two types of implantable medical devices: pacemakers and implantable cardio-
verter deﬁbrillators.
