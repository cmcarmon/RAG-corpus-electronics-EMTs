The velocity of point P in reference frame N is defined as the time derivative in N of the position vector from O to P:

)


{\displaystyle {}^{\mathrm {N} }\mathbf {v} ^{\mathrm {P} }={\frac {{}^{\mathrm {N} }\mathrm {d} }{\mathrm {d} t}}(\mathbf {r} ^{\mathrm {OP} })}

where O is any arbitrary point fixed in reference frame N, and the N to the left of the d/dt operator indicates that the derivative is taken in reference frame N. The result is independent of the selection of O so long as O is fixed in N.
