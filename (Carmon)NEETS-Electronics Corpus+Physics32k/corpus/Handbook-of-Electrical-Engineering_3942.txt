It may come as a surprise to the newcomer to practical antenna development, but it must be realized that
many microstrip antenna designs have been successfully completed with little or no CAD support. There are,
however, many situations where antennas and arrays can be designed more effectively, with better performance
and less experimental iteration, when proper CAD software tools are available. And there are situations involving
large arrays of microstrip elements which critically rely on the use of CAD software for successful design. Thus,
CAD software is not absolutely necessary for all facets of microstrip antenna design work, but good software
tools can be very useful for dealing with the more-complicated microstrip geometries. Another point that seems
to be especially true for antenna design in general is that CAD software, no matter how versatile or accurate,
cannot substitute for experience and understanding of the fundamentals of antenna operation. Further discus-
sion of microstrip antenna CAD issues can be found in [Pozar and Schaubert, 1995].
