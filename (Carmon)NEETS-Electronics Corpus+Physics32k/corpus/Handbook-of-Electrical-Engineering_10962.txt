The  internodal  distance  L  is  proportional  to  ﬁber  diameter  D  through  the  relationship  L/D »  100.  Other
ﬁber diameter relationships are expressed in Eqs. (113.5) and (113.6). Because of these relationships, thresholds
of electrical stimulation will vary inversely with ﬁber diameter. The distribution of myelinated nerve diameters
found in human peripheral nerve or skeletal muscle typically ranges from 5 to 20 mm.
