The cutoﬀ frequency for this ﬁlter occurs when the real and imaginary parts of the transfer function’s
denominator equal each other. Thus, 2πfcL = R, which gives fc =
. We want this cutoﬀ
frequency to be much less than 60 Hz. Suppose we place it at, say, 10 Hz. This speciﬁcation would
require the component values to be related by R
= 20π = 62.8. The transfer function at 60 Hz
L
would be
