DC power supplies can be broadly classiﬁed as linear and switching power supplies.
A linear power supply is the oldest and simplest type of power supply. The output voltage is regulated by
dropping the extra input voltage across a series transistor (therefore, also referred to as a series regulator). They
have very small output ripple, theoretically zero noise, large hold-up time (typically 1–2 ms), and fast response.
Linear power supplies have the following disadvantages: very low efﬁciency, electrical isolation can only be on
60-Hz ac side, larger volume and weight, and, in general, only a single output possible. However, they are still
used  in  very  small  regulated  power  supplies  and  in  some  special  applications  (e.g.,  magnet  power  supplies).
Three  terminal  linear  regulator  integrated  circuits  (ICs)  are  readily  available  (e.g.,  mA7815  has  +15-V,  1-A
output), are easy to use, and have built-in load short-circuit protection.
