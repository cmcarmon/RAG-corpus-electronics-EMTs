Conductive Substrates
If a thin ﬁlm is grown on a conductive substrate, the substrate conductance may overwhelm the ﬁlm conduc-
tance. If so, and if µ
sub and nsub are known, then Eq. (22.107) and Eq. (22.108) can be reduced to a two-layer
problem and used to extract µ
bulk and nbulk. If the substrate and ﬁlm are of different types (e.g., a p-type ﬁlm
