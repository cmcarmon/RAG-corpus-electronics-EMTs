Conclusion
The signal restoration algorithm has been shown to provide a useful means for solving a variety of important
signal  processing  problems.  In  addition  to  the  problems  described  in  this  chapter,  it  has  been  successfully
applied to the missing data problem, deconvolution, and high-dimensional Ô¨Ålter synthesis. Very useful results
can be achieved by innovatively introducing signal attributes that characterize the underlying information signals.
