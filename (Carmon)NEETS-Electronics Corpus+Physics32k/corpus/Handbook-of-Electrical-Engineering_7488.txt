Pseudorandom generator: An  algorithm  or  device  that  generates  deterministic  waveforms  which  in  many
ways resemble stochastic or random waveforms. The power spectral density, autocorrelation, and other
time averages of pseudorandom signals can closely match the time and ensemble averages of stochastic
processes. These generators are useful in computer simulation where one may be unable to generate a
truly random process, and they have the added beneÔ¨Åt of providing reproducible signals.
