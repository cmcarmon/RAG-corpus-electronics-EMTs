A second type of ceramic capacitor is manufactured in the shape of a disk. After leads are attached to
each side of the capacitor, the capacitor is completely covered with an insulating moisture-proof coating.
Ceramic capacitors usually range in value from 1 picofarad to 0.01 microfarad and may be used with
voltages as high as 30,000 volts. Some different shapes of ceramic capacitors are shown in figure 3-17.
