The only remaining unevaluated constant is A, and we can solve for this by
applying the initial condition. Equation 10.5 applies for t less than zero, and
our solution, Equation 10.17 is valid for t greater than zero. These two parts of
the solution are patched together by a continuity condition derived from Equa-
tion 9.9: An instantaneous jump in capacitor voltage requires an infinite spike
in current, so for finite current, the capacitor voltage must be continuous. This
circuit cannot support infinite capacitor current (because i(t) is finite, the infinite
current would have to come from the resistor, and this is impossible). Thus we
are justified in assuming continuity of vC, hence can equate the solutions for
negative time and positive time by solving at t = 0
