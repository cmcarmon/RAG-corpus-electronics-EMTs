In My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, the character Twilight Sparkle can teleport herself using her unicorn/alicorn magic. This is accompanied by a flash of light and explosive sound or sound of magic, after which she disappears and reappears on other place. Other characters, such as Nightmare Moon and Discord, can also teleport. Both Twilight and Nightmare Moon can teleport other objects or beings besides themselves. The limits of such magic are not known, but in the season 2 episode "Dragon Quest", Twilight has trouble teleporting all her friends to safety.
