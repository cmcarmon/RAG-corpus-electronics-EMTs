In the 14th-century, the Oxford Calculators of Merton College and French collaborators such as Nicole Oresme proved the mean speed theorem, also known as the Merton rule of uniform acceleration, or the Merton mean speed theorem. It essentially says that: a uniformly accelerated body (starting from rest, i.e., zero initial velocity) travels the same distance as a body with uniform speed whose speed is half the final velocity of the accelerated body.
