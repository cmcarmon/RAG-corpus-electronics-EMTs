We will begin the discussion of synchro operation with a few basic points on electromagnets. Look 
at figure 1-8. In this figure, a simple electromagnet is shown with a bar magnet pivoted in the 
electromagnet's field. In view A, the bar is forced to assume the position shown, since the basic law of 
magnetism states that like poles of magnets repel and unlike poles attract. Also notice that when the bar is 
aligned with the field, the magnetic lines of force are shortest. If the bar magnet is turned from this 
position and held as shown in view B, the flux is distorted and the magnetic lines of force are lengthened. 
In this condition, a force (torque) is exerted on the bar magnet. When the bar magnet is released, it snaps 
back to its original position. When the polarity of the electromagnet is reversed, as shown in view C, the 
field reverses and the bar magnet is rotated 180ยบ from its original position.
