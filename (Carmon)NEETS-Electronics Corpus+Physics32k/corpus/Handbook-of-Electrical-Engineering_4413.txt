Proof Testing of Fibers. Mechanical  failure  is  one  of  the  major  concerns  in  the  reliability  of  optical  ﬁbers.
Fiber drawn in kilometer lengths must be strong enough to survive all of the short- and long-term stresses that
it will encounter during the manufacture, installation, and long service life. Glass is an ideal elastic isotropic
solid and does not contain dislocations. Hence, the strength is determined mainly by inclusions and surface
ﬂaws. Although  extreme  care  is  taken  to  avoid  inhomogeneities  and  surface  ﬂaws  during  ﬁber  manufacture,
they cannot be completely eliminated. Since surface ﬂaws can result from various causes, they are statistical in
nature and it is very difﬁcult to predict the long-length strength of glass ﬁbers. To guarantee a minimum ﬁber
strength, proof testing has been adopted as a manufacturing step. Proof testing can be done in-line immediately
after the drawing and coating or off-line before the ﬁber is stored.
