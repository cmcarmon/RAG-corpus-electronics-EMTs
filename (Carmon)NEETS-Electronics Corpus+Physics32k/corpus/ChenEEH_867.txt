Examination of the constraints, 4.5 and 4.6, reveals a pro-
cedure for preventing clock hazards. Assuming equation 4.5 is
not satisÔ¨Åed, a suitably large value of TCP can be chosen to
satisfy constraint 4.5 and prevent zero clocking. Also note that
unlike equation 4.5, equation 4.6 is independent of the clock
period TCP (or the clock frequency). Therefore, TCP cannot be
changed to correct a double clocking hazard. Rather, a redesign
of the entire clock distribution network may be required
(Neves and Friedman, 1996a).
