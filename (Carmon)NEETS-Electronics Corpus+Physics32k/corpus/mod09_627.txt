Notice that the capacitor voltage at the end of the first 300 microseconds is greater than the capacitor 
voltage at the end of the first 100 microseconds. The voltage at the end of the first 100 microseconds is 
9.5 volts; the capacitor voltage at the end of the first 300 microseconds is 17.3 volts, an increase of 7.8 
volts.
