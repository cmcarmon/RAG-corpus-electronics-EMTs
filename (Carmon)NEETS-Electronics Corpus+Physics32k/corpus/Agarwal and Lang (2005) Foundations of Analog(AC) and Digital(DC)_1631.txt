The pullup device that we have been using thus far (and seen previously in
Section 6.11) in our digital gates is a resistor (for example, see the inverter in
Figure 11.6). In practice, we do not really use resistors as we know them they
would take up too much area. Rather, as displayed in Figure 11.14), we might
use another MOSFET with its gate connected to a second supply voltage VA,
where VA is at least one threshold voltage higher that the supply voltage VS.
This way, the pullup MOSFET remains in its ON state for any voltage between
0 and VS applied at its source.
