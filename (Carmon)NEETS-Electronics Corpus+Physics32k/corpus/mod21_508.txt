The amplitude and frequency of the signal used to modulate the carrier will determine both the 
number of significant sidebands (shown in fig. 5-19) and the amplitude of the sidebands (shown in fig. 5-
20). Both the number of significant sidebands and the bandwidth increase as the frequency of the 
modulating signal increases.
