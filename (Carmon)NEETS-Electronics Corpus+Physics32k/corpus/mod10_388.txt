A HARMONIC FREQUENCY is any frequency that is a whole number multiple of a smaller basic 
frequency. For example, a radio wave transmitted at a fundamental frequency of 3000 hertz can have a 
second harmonic of 6000 hertz, a third harmonic frequency of 9000 hertz, etc., transmitted at the same 
time.
