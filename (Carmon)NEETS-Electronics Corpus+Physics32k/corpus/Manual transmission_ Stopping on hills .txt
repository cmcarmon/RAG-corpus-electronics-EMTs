The clutch experiences most of its wear in first gear because moving the vehicle from a standstill involves a great deal of friction at the clutch. When accelerating from a standstill on an incline, this problem is made worse because the amount of work needed to overcome the acceleration of gravity causes the clutch to heat up considerably more. For this reason, stop-and-go driving and hills tend to have an effect on the clutches to a certain degree. Automatic transmissions are better suited for these applications because they have a hydraulic torque converter which is externally cooled, unlike a clutch. Torque converters also do not have a friction material that rubs off over time like a clutch. Some automatics even lock the output shaft so that the vehicle cannot roll backwards when beginning to accelerate up an incline. To reduce wear in these applications, some manual transmissions will have a very low, "granny" gear which provides the leverage to move the vehicle easily at very low speeds. This reduces wear at the clutch because the transmission requires less input torque. However, the issue of handling stops on hills is easy to learn.
Many drivers use the parking brake to prevent the vehicle from rolling backwards when starting to accelerate up a steep hill. This saves precious clutch life. A device called the hill-holder was introduced on the 1936 Studebaker. Some modern manual vehicles such as the Dodge Challenger and most Subaru models have a "hill-start assist" feature. The vehicle's computer applies just enough brake pressure to prevent the vehicle from rolling backwards. This allows the driver to start normally with no additional effort, even on steep hills.
Starting on a hill with the aid of the parking brake is not always possible since in recent vehicles that feature an electric park brake the parking brake can only be released when the brake pedal is engaged.
