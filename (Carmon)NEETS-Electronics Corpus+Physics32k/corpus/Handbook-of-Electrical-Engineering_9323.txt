Simple Hierarchical Structuring
The relation among modules should be hierarchical, i.e., modules should be the vertices of a directed acyclic
graph whose edges describe how modules refer to other modules. In such a structure, called a top-down design,
each module can be understood in terms of the modules to which it refers directly. Yet, hierarchical structuring
by itself does not yield simple and comprehensible programs. In addition, interfaces between modules must
be kept narrow, that is, (1) the use of nonlocal variables must be avoided and (2) the number of parameters
passed to a subprogram should be held to a minimum.
