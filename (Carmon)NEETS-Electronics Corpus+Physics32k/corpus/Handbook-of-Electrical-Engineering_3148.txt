to the load. In the case of battery-operated systems, there is no intermediate dc link. Inverters can be classiﬁed
as voltage source inverters (VSIs) and current source inverters (CSIs). A voltage source inverter is fed by a stiff
dc voltage, whereas a current source inverter is fed by a stiff current source. A voltage source can be converted
to a current source by connecting a series inductance and then varying the voltage to obtain the desired current.
