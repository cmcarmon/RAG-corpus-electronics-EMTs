The next example (Figure 17-16) is a more  practical 
example of a real-world voltage divider. The voltage 
source is the standard automotive accessory power 
source of 14.8 volts. What is desired is a voltage- 
divider network that will divide this 14.8 volt source 
into a lower-voltage source specified by the manufac-
turer of a tape or CD player. The first voltage desired is 
3 volts, and the load for this voltage will draw 150 mA.  
The second voltage required is 6 volts, and this volt-
ageâ€™s load will draw 400 mA. The final voltage  required 
is 9 volts, and its load draws 600 mA. Reviewing  
Figure 17-16 indicates that both series and parallel 
networks are involved. It is necessary to know the load 
currents for each voltage in advance.
