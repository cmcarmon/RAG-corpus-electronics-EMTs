While this system represents integers well, how about numbers having nonzero digits to the right of the
decimal point? In other words, how are numbers that have fractional parts represented? For such numbers,
the binary representation system is used, but with a little more complexity. The ﬂoating-point system
uses a number of bytes—typically 4 or 8—to represent the number, but with one byte (sometimes two
bytes) reserved to represent the exponent e of a power-of-two multiplier for the number—the mantissa
m—expressed by the remaining bytes.
