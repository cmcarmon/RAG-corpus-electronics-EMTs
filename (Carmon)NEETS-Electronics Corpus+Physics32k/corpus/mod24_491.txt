Figure 5-7 shows an attenuation plot generated using the multimode-reference technique. A straight
line is fitted to the long-wavelength portion of A( l ). This straight line is then displaced upward by 0.1 dB.
The point at which the straight line intersects the A( l ) plot defines the fiber cutoff wavelength ( l cf).
