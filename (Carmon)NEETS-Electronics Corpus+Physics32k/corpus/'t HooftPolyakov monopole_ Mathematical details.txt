Suppose the vacuum is the vacuum manifold Σ. Then, for finite energies, as we move along each direction towards spatial infinity, the state along the path approaches a point on the vacuum manifold Σ. Otherwise, we would not have a finite energy. In topologically trivial 3 + 1 dimensions, this means spatial infinity is homotopically equivalent to the topological sphere S2. So, the superselection sectors are classified by the second homotopy group of Σ, π2(Σ).
In the special case of a Yang–Mills–Higgs theory, the vacuum manifold is isomorphic to the quotient space G/H and the relevant homotopy group is π2(G/H). Note that this doesn't actually require the existence of a scalar Higgs field. Most symmetry breaking mechanisms (e.g. technicolor) would also give rise to a 't Hooft–Polyakov monopole.
It's easy to generalize to the case of d + 1 dimensions. We have πd−1(Σ).
