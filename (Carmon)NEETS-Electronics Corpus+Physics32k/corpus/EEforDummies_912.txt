You commonly use solderless breadboards to test your circuit design ideas 
or explore circuits as you’re learning how things work. If you create and test 
a circuit using a breadboard and you want to use the circuit on a long‐term 
basis, you can re‐create it on a soldered or printed circuit board (PCB). A 
PCB is a kind of breadboard, but instead of contact holes, it has ordinary 
holes with copper pads surrounding each hole and lines of metal connecting 
the holes within each row. You make connections by soldering component 
leads to the copper pads, ensuring that the components you’re connecting 
are located in the same row. In this book, I focus exclusively on circuit con-
struction using solderless breadboards.
