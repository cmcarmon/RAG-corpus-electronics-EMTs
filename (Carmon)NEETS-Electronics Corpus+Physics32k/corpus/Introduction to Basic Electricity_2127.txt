The only way to obtain a resistor such 
as resistor R2 (5.36 V) or R3 (18.75 V) is 
to spend a large amount of money for a 
custom-made resistor. The student should 
realize the goal is almost always to design 
and build practical and economical equip-
ment. The use of precision components of-
ten increases costs with little or no benefit.
