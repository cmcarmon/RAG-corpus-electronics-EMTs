One basic approach to speech recognition is represented by the block diagram shown in Fig. 89.20. This is
a system that is built around a special chip developed by Texas Instruments. This system uses templates and
special  algorithms  for  recognizing  the  input  speech  patterns.  The  system  is  speaker  dependent,  with  the
capability of storing up to 32 word templates and user-deﬁned phrases. The output portion may be superﬂuous
when  the  system  is  used  only  for  inputting  data  and  commands,  but  can  be  a  useful  adjunct  to  the  visual
response. Other techniques such as speaker-independent and phoneme-recognition systems are also available.
Vocabularies range from 50 to 5000 active words, and both isolated and connected words can be recognized,
although the larger numbers tend to be associated with isolated word systems. In general, it seems feasible that
a combination of speech input and pen-based computing may ﬁnd a viable market.
