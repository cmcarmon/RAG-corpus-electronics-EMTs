It is also prone to tactical voting. The result may also depend on the order in which candidates are considered.
In the example above, if supporters of Knoxville pretended to prefer Memphis over Nashville or Chattanooga, they could enable Knoxville to appear in the final motion. The voting would have been:
Motion proposed "Memphis shall be the capital of Tennessee."
Amendment proposed "Delete 'Memphis' and insert 'Nashville'." Rejected 59% to 41% so motion remains "Memphis shall be the capital of Tennessee."
Amendment proposed "Delete 'Memphis' and insert 'Chattanooga'." Rejected 59% to 41% so motion remains "Memphis shall be the capital of Tennessee."
Amendment proposed "Delete 'Memphis' and insert 'Knoxville'." Passed 58% to 42% so motion becomes "Knoxville shall be the capital of Tennessee."
Vote on motion "Knoxville shall be the capital of Tennessee." Outcome uncertain.
This particular tactical voting would not work if Knoxville had been nominated before Memphis or Chattanooga.
