Letâ€™s take a look at the block diagram of a cw transmitter and its power supply in figure 2-1. The
oscillator generates the rf carrier at a preset frequency and maintains it within close tolerances. The
oscillator may be a self-excited type, such as an electron-coupled oscillator, or a quartz crystal type,
which uses a crystal cut to vibrate at a certain frequency when electrically excited. In both types, voltage
and current delivered by the oscillator are weak. The oscillator outputs must be amplified many times to
be radiated any distance.
