This suggests a very simple method for finding the complex amplitude Vc
directly from the circuit: Redraw the circuit, replacing resistors with R
boxes, capacitors with 1/Cs1 boxes, and cosine sources by their ampli-
tudes, in this case Vi, as shown in Figure 13.6. Now Vc can be found in
one line. But what are these boxes? And what is Vc? The next section
will provide the answers.
