Elements of kinematics diagrams include the frame, which is the frame of reference for all the moving components, as well as links (kinematic pairs), and joints. Primary Joints include pins, sliders and other elements that allow pure rotation or pure linear motion. Higher order joints also exist that allow a combination of rotation or linear motion. Kinematic diagrams also include points of interest, and other important components.
