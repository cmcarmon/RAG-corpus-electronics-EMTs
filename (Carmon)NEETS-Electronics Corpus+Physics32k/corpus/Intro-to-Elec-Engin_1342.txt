When we employ ampliﬁers in communication systems to boost the level of a signal, we are
also amplifying the noise corrupting the signal. Because any ampliﬁer has some ﬁnite passband,
we may model an ampliﬁer as a ﬁlter with frequency response characteristic H(f ). Let us evaluate
the effect of the ampliﬁer on an input thermal noise source.
