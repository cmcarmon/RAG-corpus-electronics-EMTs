First letter – semiconductor material:  
 
 
 
 
Second letter – application:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Third letter – in the case of diodes for specialized 
applications, the third letter does not generally have 
any particular significance 
Zener  diodes  –  zener  diodes  have  an  additional 
letter  (which  appears  after  the  numbers)  which 
denotes  the  tolerance  of  the  zener  voltage.  The 
following letters are used: 
 
 
 
 
Zener diodes also have additional characters which 
indicate the zener voltage (e.g. 9V1 denotes 9.1V).
