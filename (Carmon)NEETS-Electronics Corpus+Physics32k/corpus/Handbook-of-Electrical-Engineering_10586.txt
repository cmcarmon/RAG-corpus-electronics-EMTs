Another  important  factor  is  the  lighting  effectiveness  factor  (LEF).
An overall lighting system efﬁciency factor considers both the quality of
light  as  reference  to  equivalent  sphere  illumination  and  the  effects  of
veiling reﬂections. Light patterns such as “batwing” can help solve veiling
reﬂection problems. Figure 107.5 shows the light distribution curve of a
typical batwing luminaire.
