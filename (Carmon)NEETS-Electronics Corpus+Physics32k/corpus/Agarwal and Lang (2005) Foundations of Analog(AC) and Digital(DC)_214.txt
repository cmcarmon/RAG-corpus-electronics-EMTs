This section described how we model physical elements such as batteries
and wires in terms of ideal two-terminal elements such as independent voltage
sources, resistors, and ideal wires. Our ideal circuit elements such as indepen-
dent voltage sources and resistors also serve as models for physical entities such
as water reservoirs and friction in water tubes, respectively. In the circuit model
for a physical system, water pressure is naturally represented using a voltage,
and water flow using a current. Water pressure and water flow, or the corre-
sponding voltage and current, are fundamental quantities. In such systems, we
will also be concerned with the amount of energy stored in the system, and the
rate at which energy is being dissipated.
