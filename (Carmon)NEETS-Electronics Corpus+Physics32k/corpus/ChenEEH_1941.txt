In the static method, reconﬁguration paths are predeter-
mined to conform to a certain pattern, such as from going
left to right along rows (as depicted in Figure 8.7). CSs are then
inserted wherever needed along these paths (also shown in
Figure 8.7) as part of the original routing. This is a static
approach in the sense that the CS insertion is oblivious to
the presence and location of faults. Whenever faults occur that
conform to the predetermined reconﬁgurable pattern (e.g., one
fault per row), the transposition of conﬁguration bits from
dependent to cover cells automatically achieves complete re-
conﬁguration—the interconnect ‘‘hooks’’ needed by the cover
cells to connect to nets routed to their dependent cells are
already in place. Thus, reconﬁguration is extremely fast with
times determined primarily by transposition of cell conﬁgur-
ation bits.
