You should now know how voltage regulators work to provide constant output voltages. In some 
circuits it may be necessary to regulate the current output. The circuitry which provides a constant current 
output is called a constant current regulator or just CURRENT REGULATOR. The schematic shown in 
figure 4-40 is a simplified schematic for a current regulator. The variable resistor shown on the schematic 
is used to illustrate the concept of current regulation. You should know from your study of voltage 
regulators that a variable resistor does not respond quickly enough to compensate for the changes. Notice 
that an ammeter has been included in this circuit to indicate that the circuit shown is that of a current 
regulator. When the circuit functions properly, the current reading of the ammeter remains constant. In 
this case the variable resistor (RV) compensates for changes in the load or dc input voltage. Adequate 
current regulation results in the loss of voltage regulation. Studying the schematic shown, you should 
recall that any increase in load resistance causes a drop in current. To maintain a constant current flow, 
the resistance of RV must be reduced whenever the load resistance increases. This causes the total 
resistance to remain constant. An increase in the input voltage must be compensated for by an increase in 
the resistance of RV, thereby maintaining a constant current flow. The operation of a current regulator is 
similar to that of a voltage regulator. The basic difference is that one regulates current and the other 
regulates voltage.
