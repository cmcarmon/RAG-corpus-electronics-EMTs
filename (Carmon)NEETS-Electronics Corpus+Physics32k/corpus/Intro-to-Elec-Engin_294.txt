The block diagrams of complex feedback control systems usually contain several feedback
loops, and they may have to be simpliÔ¨Åed in order to evaluate an overall transfer function for the
system. A few of the block diagram reduction manipulations are given in Table 3.4.1; no attempt
is made here to cover all the possibilities.
