A salient-pole rotor construction is best suited mechanically for hydroelectric generators
because hydroelectric turbines operate at relatively low speeds, and a relatively large number
of poles is required in order to produce the desired frequency (60 Hz in the United States),
in accordance with Equation (12.2.9). Salient-pole construction is also employed for most
synchronous motors.
