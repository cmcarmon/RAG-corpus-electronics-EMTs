Given this information, the optimization goal is to compute
a feasible clock schedule s (respectively t
cd) so as to minimize
the least square error between the computed clock schedule s
and the objective clock schedule g. Recall that the least square
error et (described by equation 4.20) is deÔ¨Åned as the sum of
the squares of the distances (algebraic differences) between the
actual and objective clock skews over all local data paths in
the circuit. This problem is described in a formal framework
in the following section. Also in the following section, the
mathematical algorithm to solve this revised problem is
explained in greater detail.
