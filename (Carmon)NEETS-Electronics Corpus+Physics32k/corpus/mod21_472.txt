Attaining 100% amplitude modulation of an rf carrier with a sine wave requires a modulating power 
equal to one-half of the rf carrier power. Under this condition, the average power of the modulated carrier 
is equal to 1.5 times the average unmodulated carrier power. The added power is divided equally between 
the upper and lower sidebands. During the peaks of 100% modulation, the amplitude of the carrier is 
doubled. This will cause the instantaneous peak power to be four times the instantaneous unmodulated 
peak power P = E2/R. When voice modulation is employed, only the highest amplitude peaks can be 
allowed to modulate the carrier 100%. Since many speech components do not modulate the carrier 100%, 
the average power required for voice modulation is less than that required for modulation with a sine 
wave. Voice peaks usually modulate a carrier 100% when the modulation increases the average carrier 
output power 25% over its normal value.
