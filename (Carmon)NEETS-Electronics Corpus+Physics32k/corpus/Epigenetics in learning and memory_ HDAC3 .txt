HDAC3 is also a negative regulator of long term potentiation formation. McQuown et al. have shown that:
KOs of HDAC3 in dorsal hippocampus resulted in enhanced memory during object location tests (OLM).
RGFP136, HDAC3 inhibitor, enhances LTP for object recognition and location
RGFP136 enhances LTP through CBP-dependent mechanism
HDAC3 deletions showed increased Nr4a2 and c-Fos expression
HDAC3 interacts with NCoR and HDAC4 to perform its role in memory formation
