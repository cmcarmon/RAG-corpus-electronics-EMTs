The control-grid modulator uses a variation of grid bias (at the frequency of the modulating signal) 
to vary the instantaneous plate voltage and current. These variations cause modulation of the carrier 
frequency. The carrier frequency is introduced through coupling capacitor Cc. The modulating frequency 
is introduced in series with the grid bias through T1. As the modulating signal increases and decreases 
(positive and negative), it will add to or subtract from the bias on rf amplifier V1. This change in bias 
causes a corresponding change in plate voltage and current. These changes in plate voltage and current 
add vectorially to the carrier frequency and provide a modulation envelope in the same fashion as does 
the plate modulator. Since changes in the plate circuit of the rf amplifier are controlled by changes in the 
grid bias, the gain of the tube requires only a low-level modulating signal. Even when the input signals 
are at these low levels, occasional modulation voltage peaks will occur that will cause V1 to saturate. This 
creates distortion in the output. Care must be taken to bias the rf amplifier tube for maximum power out
