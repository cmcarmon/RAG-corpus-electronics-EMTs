collect all the necessary conditions for sensitizing the transitions. For example, in the example given above the
ﬁrst pattern requires input ﬂip-ﬂops A, B, and C all to be set to the logic 1 value in order to sensitize a low-to-
high  transition  at  the  D  input,  whereas  the  second  test  pattern  requires  A,  B,  and  C  all  to  remain  at  logic  1
while D is changed from logic 0 to the logic 1 value. This way the transitions created on input D will travel
through the identiﬁed signal path to reach the destination ﬂip-ﬂop Z.
