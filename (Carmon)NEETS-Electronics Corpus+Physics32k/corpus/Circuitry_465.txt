In the simple circuit shown in Fig. 10.1 a battery is 
connected  to  a  lamp  via  a  switch.  There  are  two 
possible states for the switch, open and closed but 
the  lamp  will  only  operate  when  the  switch  is 
closed.  We can summarize this using Table 10.1.  
  Since  the  switch  can  only  be  in  one  of  the  two 
states  (i.e.  open  or  closed)  at  any  given  time,  the 
open and closed conditions are mutually exclusive. 
Furthermore,  since  the  switch  cannot  exist  in  any 
other  state  than  completely  open  or  completely 
closed  (i.e.  there  is  no  intermediate  or  half-open 
state)  the  circuit  uses  binary  or  ‘two-state’  logic. 
The  logical  state  of  the  switch  can  be  represented 
by  the  binary  digits, 0 and  1.  For  example,  if 
logical  0  is  synonymous  with  open  (or  ‘off’)  and 
logical 1 is equivalent to closed (or ‘on’), then: 
 
Switch open (off) = 0 
Switch closed (on) = 1
