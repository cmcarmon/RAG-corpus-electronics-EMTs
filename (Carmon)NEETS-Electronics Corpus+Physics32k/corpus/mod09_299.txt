With a small value of resistance, however, the phase angle or phase shift is less than 90 degrees. In 
the phase-shift oscillator, therefore, at least three RC sections are needed to give the required 180-degree 
phase shift for regenerative feedback. The values of resistance and capacitance are generally chosen so 
that each section provides about a 60-degree phase shift.
