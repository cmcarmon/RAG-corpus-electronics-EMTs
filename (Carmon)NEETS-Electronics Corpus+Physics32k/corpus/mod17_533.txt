SPATIAL-TIME FACTOR.â€”Very accurate antenna pointing information is available to earth 
terminals from the satellite control facility located in Sunnyvale, California. Because of equipment 
limitations, a small search about the predicted location of the satellite must often be conducted to make 
initial contact. Either a manual or automatic scan is made around a small area close to the point where the 
satellite appearance is predicted.
