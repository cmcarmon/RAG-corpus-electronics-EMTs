Here, we specify:
Virtual forces and stresses as variations of the real forces and stresses.
Virtual forces be zero on the part




S

t




{\displaystyle S_{t}}
of the surface that has prescribed forces, and thus only surface (reaction) forces on




S

u




{\displaystyle S_{u}}
(where displacements are prescribed) would do work.
The virtual work equation becomes the principle of virtual forces:

{\displaystyle \int _{S_{u}}\mathbf {u} ^{T}\delta \ \mathbf {T} dS+\int _{V}\mathbf {u} ^{T}\delta \ \mathbf {f} dV=\int _{V}{\boldsymbol {\epsilon }}^{T}\delta {\boldsymbol {\sigma }}dV\qquad \mathrm {(g)} }

This relation is equivalent to the set of strain-compatibility equations as well as of the displacement boundary conditions on the part




S

u




{\displaystyle S_{u}}
. It has another name: the principle of complementary virtual work.
