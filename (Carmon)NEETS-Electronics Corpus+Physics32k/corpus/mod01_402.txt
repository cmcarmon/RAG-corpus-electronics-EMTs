The CAPACITY of a battery is measured in ampere-hours. The ampere-hour capacity is equal to the 
product of the current in amperes and the time in hours during which the battery will supply this current. 
The ampere-hour capacity varies inversely with the discharge current. For example, a 400 ampere-hour 
battery will deliver 400 amperes for 1 hour or 100 amperes for 4 hours.
