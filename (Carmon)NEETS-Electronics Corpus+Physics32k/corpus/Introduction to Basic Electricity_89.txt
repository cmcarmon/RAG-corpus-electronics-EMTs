Simplification	of	the	Source,	sometimes	referred	to	as	Source	Transformation,	is
the	process	of	converting	electric	current	into	voltage,	or	voltage	into	electric
current.	It	is	a	common	technique	used	by	many	circuit	engineers	for	explaining
their	circuit’s	system	in	simple	terms.
The	process	of	Simplification	of	the	Source	usually	begins	with	an	existing
resistance	source	in	a	circuit;	it	is	then	replaced	with	new	electric	current	source
with	a	similar	level	of	resistance.	Since	it	is	bilateral	procedure,	one	can	be
derived	to	yield	results	from	another.	It	makes	way	for	the	adjustment	of	voltage	as
it	gradually	becomes	the	equivalent	of	a	particular	circuit’s	resistance.
Moreover,	Simplification	of	the	Source	may	begin	with	an	existing	resistance,	but
is	not	limited	to	the	accommodation	of	resistive	circuits.	It	means	that	the	process
can	be	performed	on	circuits	that	involve	inductors	and	capacitors.
