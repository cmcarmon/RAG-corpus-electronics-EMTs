What is a 
? What is digital image processing? Why does the use of computers to process pictures
seem to be everywhere? The space program, robots, and even people with personal computers are using digital
image processing techniques. In this section we shall describe what a digital image is, how one obtains digital
images, what the problems with digital images are (they are not trouble-free), and Ô¨Ånally how these images are
used by computers. A discussion of processing the images is presented later in the section. At the end of this
section is a bibliography of selected references on digital image processing.
