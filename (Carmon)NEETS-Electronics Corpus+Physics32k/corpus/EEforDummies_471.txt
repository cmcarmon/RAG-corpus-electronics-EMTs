With the current on, the lines of force encircle the wire and are spaced 
evenly along the length of the wire, as shown in Figure 8-2. Picture a roll of 
paper towels with a wire running through its exact center. If you pass current 
through the wire, invisible flux lines will wrap around the wire along the sur-
face of the roll, and along similar rings around the wire at various distances 
from the wire. The strength of the magnetic force decreases as the flux lines 
get farther away from the wire. If you wind the current‐carrying wire into 
a uniform coil of wire, the flux lines align and reinforce each other: You’ve 
strengthened the magnetic field.
