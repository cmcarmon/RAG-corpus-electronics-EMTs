The case of




d
=
2



{\displaystyle d=2\,}

is the classic Mandelbrot set from which the name is derived.
The sets for other values of d also show fractal images when they are plotted on the complex plane.
Each of the examples of various powers d shown below is plotted to the same scale. Values of c belonging to the set are black. Values of c that have unbounded value under recursion, and thus do not belong in the set, are plotted in different colours, that show as contours, depending on the number of recursions that caused a value to exceed a fixed magnitude in the Escape Time algorithm.
