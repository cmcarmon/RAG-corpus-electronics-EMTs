(b) Find the permissible kVA rating of the auto-
transformer if the winding currents are not to
exceed those for full-load operation as a two-
winding transformer. How much of that is
transformed by electromagnetic induction?
(c) Based on the data given for the two-winding
transformer in Problem 11.4.1, compute
the efﬁciency of the autotransformer corre-
sponding to full load and 0.8 lagging power
factor. Comment on why the efﬁciency of
the autotransformer is higher than that of the
two-winding transformer.
