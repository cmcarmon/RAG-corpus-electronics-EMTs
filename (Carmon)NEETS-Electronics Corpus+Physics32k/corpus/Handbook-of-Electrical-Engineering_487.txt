The most common function in signal processing is the Butterworth. It is a function that has only poles (i.e.,
maximally
no ﬁnite zeros) and has the ﬂattest magnitude possible in the passband. This function is also called 
ﬂat magnitude (MFM)
. The derivation of this function is illustrated by taking a general all-pole function of
third-order with a dc gain of 1 as follows:
