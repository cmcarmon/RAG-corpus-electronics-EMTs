The Magnetospheric eternally collapsing object (MECO) is an alternative model for black holes proposed in 2003 by Darryl Leiter and Stanley Robertson a generalization of the eternally collapsing object (ECO) proposed by Abhas Mitra in 1998. A proposed observable difference between MECOs and black holes is that a MECO can produce its own intrinsic magnetic field. An uncharged black hole cannot produce its own magnetic field, though its accretion disc can.
