The notion of “object” is central to OODBMS. An object can be seen as being an entity consisting of its own
private memory and external interface (or protocol). The private memory is used to store the state of the object,
and  the  external  interface  consists  of  a  set  of  operations  that  can  be  performed  on  the  object.  An  object
communicates  with  other  objects  through  messages  sent  to  its  external  interface. When  an  object  receives  a
message, it responds by using its own procedures, known as methods. The methods are responsible for processing
the data in the object’s private memory and sending messages to other objects to perform speciﬁc tasks and
possibly send back appropriate results.
