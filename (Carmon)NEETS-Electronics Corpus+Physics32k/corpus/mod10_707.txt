A three-dipole array with negligible spacing between elements gives a gain of 3.3 dB. In other 
words, when two elements are used with wider spacing, the gain obtained is approximately equal to the 
gain obtainable from three elements with close spacing. The spacing of this array permits simpler 
construction, since only two dipoles are used. It also allows the antenna to occupy less space. 
Construction problems usually dictate small-array spacing.
