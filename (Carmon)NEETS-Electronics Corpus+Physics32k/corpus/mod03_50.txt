If you intend to accomplish anything in the field of electricity and electronics, you must be aware of
the forces acting inside the circuits with which you work. Modules 1 and 2 of this training series
introduced you to the physics involved in the study of electricity and to the fundamental concepts of
direct and alternating current. The terms voltage (volts), current (amperes), and resistance (ohms) were
explained, as well as the various circuit elements; e.g., resistors, capacitors, inductors, transformers, and
batteries.
