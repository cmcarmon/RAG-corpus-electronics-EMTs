One of the fundamental laws of electricity is that LIKE CHARGES REPEL EACH OTHER and
UNLIKE CHARGES ATTRACT EACH OTHER. A positive charge and negative charge, being unlike,
tend to move toward each other. In the atom, the negative electrons are drawn toward the positive protons
in the nucleus. This attractive force is balanced by the electronâ€™s centrifugal force caused by its rotation
about the nucleus. As a result, the electrons remain in orbit and are not drawn into the nucleus. Electrons
repel each other because of their like negative charges, and protons repel each other because of their like
positive charges.
