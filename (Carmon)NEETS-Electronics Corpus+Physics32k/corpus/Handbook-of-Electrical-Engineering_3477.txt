Examination of various packaging techniques reveals that the junction-to-coolant thermal resistance is, in
fact, composed of an internal, largely conductive, resistance and an external, primarily convective, resistance.
As shown in Fig. 33.5, the internal resistance, Rjc , is encountered in the ﬂow of dissipated heat from the active
chip surface, through the materials used to support and bond the chip, and on to the case of the integrated
circuit package. The ﬂow of heat from the case directly to the coolant, or indirectly through a ﬁn structure and
then to the coolant, must overcome the external resistance, Rex.
