The purpose of delayed binding is to increase the level of a HLL by introducing abstraction. Abstraction is
the major differentiating feature between HLLs and other computer languages. Without abstraction and delayed
binding, most HLLs would be no more powerful than a macro assembler language. However, with abstraction,
HLLs permit a programmer to express ideas that transcend the boundaries of the physical machine.
