term  is  integrated  and  inverted.  Finally,
To  obtain

term is integrated and inverted. The forcing func-
tion is injected at the proper point. Thus, the analog computer for solv-
ing  Eq.  (6.38)  is  implemented  by  connecting  the  necessary  summers,
inverters, and integrators. A plotter or oscilloscope may be used to view
the output x, or
