A more popular type of series regulator is the 
 feedback regulator. A feedback regulator consists of a 
feedback circuit to monitor the output voltage. If the 
output voltage changes, a control signal is developed 
that controls the transistor’s conductance. Figure  36-26 
shows a block diagram of the feedback regulator. An 
unregulated DC voltage is applied to the input of 
the regulator. A lower, regulated DC output voltage 
 appears at the output terminals of the regulator.
