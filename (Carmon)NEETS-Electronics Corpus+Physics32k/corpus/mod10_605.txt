Fortunately, separate antennas seldom are required for both transmitting and receiving rf energy. 
Any antenna can transfer energy from space to its input receiver with the same efficiency that it transfers 
energy from the transmitter into space. Of course, this is assuming that the same frequency is used in both 
cases. This property of interchangeability of the same antenna for transmitting and receiving is known as 
antenna RECIPROCITY. Antenna reciprocity is possible because antenna characteristics are essentially 
the same for sending and receiving electromagnetic energy.
