With the pan empty, move all the sliders to the leftmost position so they read 0.
Make sure that the pan is clean.
Make sure that the balance reads 0. The 500 adjustment knob can be used to adjust the scale pointer.
Once the balance is calibrated, place the objects on the pan and adjust the riders. The hundred rider should be initially adjusted and follow by the tens rider. Adjust the ones rider until the scale pointer is at zero again.
