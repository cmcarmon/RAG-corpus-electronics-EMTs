The MOSFET is a majority carrier device. In the case of the
n-channel MOSFET shown in Figure 7.11, the electrons travel-
ing from source to drain have to overcome the resistance
offered by the channel, the accumulation region at the surface,
the neck or JFET region between the p-wells, the drift region,
and the substrate, as indicated in Figure 7.12(A). The overall
resistance of the device is determined by the contributions of
the individual components. Thus, the following is true:
