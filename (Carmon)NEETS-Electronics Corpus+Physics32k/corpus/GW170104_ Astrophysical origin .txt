Analysis indicated the signal resulted from the inspiral and merger of a pair of black holes (BBH) with 31.2+8.4
−6.0 and 19.4+5.3
−5.9 times the mass of the Sun, at a distance of 880+450
−390 megaparsecs (2.9+1.5
−1.3 billion light years) from Earth. The resulting black hole had a mass of 48.7+5.7
−4.6 solar masses, two solar masses having been radiated away as gravitational energy. The peak luminosity of GW170104 was 3.1+0.7
−1.3×1049 W.
