Wearless operation, durability. Air bearings operate contact-free and so without abrasion. The only friction results from airflow air in the gap. Thus, the durability of air bearings is unlimited if they are designed and calculated correctly. Especially roller and friction bearings face a high friction when applied at high speed or acceleration or small strokes, causing high abrasion such that the precision decreases which in turn causes a breakdown.
Guiding, repeatability, and position accuracy. In the chip production and when positioning at the back-end, repeatability accuracy of 1-2 µm must be reached with the wire bonder. At the die bonder, even 5 µm must be achieved. With such a precision, roller bearings reach their physical limit without a lower acceleration. At the front end (lithography), air bearings are already established.
Cost advantage and repeatability. When applied in series, gas bearings can have a cost advantage over roller bearings: the production of a roller-guided high-frequency spindle is – according to a manufacturer – about 20% more expensive than air-guided spindles.
Environmental purity. Because they do not require the use of oil for their lubrication and are frictionless, gas bearings are suited for applications requiring a low contamination of the working fluid. This is a critical aspect to the pharmaceutical industry, nuclear fuel processing, semi-conductor manufacturing and energy conversion cycles.
