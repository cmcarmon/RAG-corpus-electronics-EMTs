Some test instruments you will be using are calibrated in decibels and have a 1 milliwatt zero
reference level. Figure 2-1 illustrates such an instrument. Notice that this is an ac voltmeter in which the
upper scale of the meter indicates ac voltage and the lower scale indicates decibels. The zero power-level
indicator on the decibel scale is located at, or near, center scale. If the power in the line being measured is
more than the reference value, the meter will indicate a value to the right of the zero mark (+dB). If the
power is less than the reference value, the meter will indicate a value to the left of the zero mark ( - dB).
Such meters are useful when recording measurements where a direct indication in decibels is desired.
However, you must remember that this meter is still a voltmeter and that power measurements are not
meaningful unless the circuit impedance is known. If you feel the need to review how to calculate power
in ac circuits, refer to NEETS, Module 2.
