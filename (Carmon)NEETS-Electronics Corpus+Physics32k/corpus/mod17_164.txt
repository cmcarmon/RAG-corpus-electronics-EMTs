Designing and building a stable crystal oscillator is difficult. As operating frequencies increase, the
crystal must be ground so thin that it often cracks while vibrating. You will find that you can get around
this problem by operating the oscillators in most transmitters at comparatively low frequencies,
sometimes as low as 1/100 (.01) of the output frequency. You raise the oscillator frequency to the
required output frequency by passing it through one or more frequency multipliers. Frequency multipliers
are special power amplifiers that multiply the input frequency. Stages that multiply the frequency by 2 are
called doublers; those that multiply by 3 are triplers; and those multiplying by 4 are quadruplers.
