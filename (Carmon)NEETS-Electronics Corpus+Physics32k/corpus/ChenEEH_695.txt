considered to put even more bits per square micrometer
(Okuda and Murotani, 1997). This research direction is still
mostly focused on the cell itself. SOI type devices are being
investigated (Kuge et al., 1996) to keep the power reasonable,
but recognized is that low voltage CMOS does much to achieve
this (Horiguchi et al., 1995).
