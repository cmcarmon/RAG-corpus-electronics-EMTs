For an ideal string, the dispersion relation can be written as




ω
=
k



T
μ





{\displaystyle \omega =k{\sqrt {\frac {T}{\mu }}}}

where T is the tension force in the string and μ is the string's mass per unit length. As for the case of electromagnetic waves in a vacuum, ideal strings are thus a non-dispersive medium i.e., the phase and group velocities are equal and independent (to first order) of vibration frequency.
For a nonideal string, where stiffness is taken into account, the dispersion relation is written as

{\displaystyle \omega ^{2}={\frac {T}{\mu }}k^{2}+\alpha k^{4}}

where



α


{\displaystyle \alpha }
is a constant that depends on the string.
