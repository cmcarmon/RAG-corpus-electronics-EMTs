Converting a language-based description into the layout of an FPGA is an application of logic synthesis, a
technology which has evolved independently of programmable logic design tools, but which has now converged
with them. However, programmable devices offer new problems to the designer of general-purpose design tools
due to the great variety of architectures now existing for the complex devices. Programmable logic design tools
are now becoming more integrated into mainstream computer-aided design systems and are starting to adopt
the same standards, for example use of the VHDL language for speciÔ¨Åcation.
