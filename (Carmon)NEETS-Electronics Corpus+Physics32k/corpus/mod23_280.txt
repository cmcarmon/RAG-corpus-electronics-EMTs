Odd-order harmonics are normally caused by the magnetic tape itself. Even-order harmonics are
normally caused by (1) permanently magnetized magnetic heads, (2) faulty circuits, or (3) asymmetrical
or unbalanced bias signals. As you might guess, even-order harmonics can be reduced by doing the right
maintenance and periodic performance tests.
