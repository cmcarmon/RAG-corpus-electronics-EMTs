where Gij(s) is the ijth entry of G(s) and where uj(s) is the
Laplace transform of the jth input. Equation 3.6 shows that in
MIMO systems, the outputs are linear combinations of the
inputs where the weights are rational transfer functions. Only
the poles of the entries in the ith row of G(s) can affect yi(s),
depending on which inputs are nonzero. More insight can be
gained by solving for yi(s) in a state-space representation of the
system. Because the poles correspond only to the controllable
and observable eigenvalues of A, let equation 3.3 be a minimal,
that is, a controllable and observable realization of G(s) with n
states. The Laplace transform of the ith output is given by:
