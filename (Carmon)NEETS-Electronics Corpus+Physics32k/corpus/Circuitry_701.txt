Safety considerations 
 
Before  we outline the basic steps for fault finding 
on some  simple  electronic  circuits,  it  is  vitally 
important  that  you  are  aware  of  the  potential 
hazards associated with equipment which uses high 
voltages or is operated from the a.c. mains supply. 
  Whereas  many  electronic  circuits  operate  from 
low voltage supplies and can thus be handled quite 
safely,  the  high  a.c.  voltages  present  in  mains 
operated  equipment  represent  a  potentially  lethal 
shock  hazard.  The  following  general  rules  should 
always be followed when handling such equipment: 
 
1.  Switch  off  the  mains  supply  and  remove  the 
mains  power  connector  whenever  any  of  the 
following tasks are being performed: 
(a)  Dismantling the equipment. 
(b)  Inspecting fuses. 
(c)  Disconnecting  or 
  modules. 
(d)  Desoldering or soldering components. 
(e)  Carrying  out  continuity  tests  on  switches,
