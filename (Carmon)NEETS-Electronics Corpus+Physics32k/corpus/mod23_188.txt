Tape guides are strategically placed in a tape reeling system to make sure the magnetic tape is kept 
straight with respect to the supply and take-up reels and the magnetic heads. Some magnetic recorders use 
only fixed tape guides, some use rotary tape guides, and some use a combination of the two.
