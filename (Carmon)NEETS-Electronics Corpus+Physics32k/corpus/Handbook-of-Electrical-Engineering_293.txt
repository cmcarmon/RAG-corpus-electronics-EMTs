In 1910, Henry Leland, Cadillac Motors president, commissioned Charles Kettering and his Dayton
Engineering Laboratories Company to develop an electric self-starter to replace the crank. Kettering had
to overcome two large problems: (1) making a motor small enough to ﬁt in a car yet powerful enough
to crank the engine, and (2) ﬁnding a battery more powerful than any yet in existence. Electric Storage
Battery of Philadelphia supplied an experimental 65-lb battery and Delco unveiled a working prototype
electric “self-starter” system installed in a 1912 Cadillac on February 17, 1911. Leland immediately ordered
12,000 units for Cadillac. Within a few years, almost all new cars were equipped with electric starters.
