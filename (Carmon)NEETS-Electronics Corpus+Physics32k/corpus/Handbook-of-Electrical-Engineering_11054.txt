and  it  can  be  used  to  stimulate  the  brain,  peripheral  nerves,  and  the  heart.  The  parameters  associated  with
eddy-current stimulation are kiloamperes, Teslas/sec, milliohms, microhenries, microseconds, and low damp-
ing. Because the forces on the coil conductors are very large, special care is required in fabricating such coils.
