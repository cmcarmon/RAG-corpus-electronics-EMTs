Adjusts the magnitude of the signal attenuator (V/cm) displayed (V/cm) and sets the vertical 
voltage scale. This control is invariably a multi-position rotary switch; however, an additional 
variable gain control is sometimes also provided. Often this control is concentric with the main 
control and the ‘CAL’ position is usually at one, or other, extreme setting of the control. 
Positions the display along the vertical axis of the CRT. 
Normally an oscilloscope employs d.c. coupling throughout the vertical amplifier; hence a shift 
along the vertical axis will occur whenever a direct voltage is present at the input. When 
investigating waveforms in a circuit one often encounters a.c. superimposed on d.c. levels; the 
latter may be removed by inserting a capacitor in series with the signal. With the a.c.-d.c.-ground 
switch in the d.c. position a capacitor is inserted in the input lead, whereas in the DC position the 
capacitor is shorted. If ground is selected, the vertical input is taken to common (0 V) and the 
oscilloscope input is left floating. This last facility is useful in allowing the accurate positioning 
of the vertical position control along the central axis. The switch may then be set to d.c. and the 
magnitude of any d.c. level present at the input may be easily measured by examining the shift 
along the vertical axis. 
This control, which is only used in dual beam oscilloscopes, provides selection of the beam 
splitting mode. In the chopped position, the trace displays a small portion of one vertical channel 
waveform followed by an equally small portion of the other. The traces are, in effect, sampled at 
a relatively fast rate, the result being two apparently continuous displays. In the alternate 
position, a complete horizontal sweep is devoted to each channel alternately.
