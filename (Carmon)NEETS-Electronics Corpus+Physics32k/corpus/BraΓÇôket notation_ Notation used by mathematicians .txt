The object physicists are considering when using bra–ket notation is a Hilbert space (a complete inner product space).
Let H be a Hilbert space and h ∈ H a vector in H. What physicists would denote by |h⟩ is the vector itself. That is,





|

h
⟩
∈


H




{\displaystyle |h\rangle \in {\mathcal {H}}}
.
Let H* be the dual space of H. This is the space of linear functionals on H. The isomorphism Φ : H → H* is defined by Φ(h) = φh, where for every g ∈ H we define





ϕ

h


(
g
)
=


IP


(
h
,
g
)
=
(
h
,
g
)
=
⟨

g
⟩
=
⟨
h

|

g
⟩


{\displaystyle \phi _{h}(g)={\mbox{IP}}(h,g)=(h,g)=\langle h,g\rangle =\langle h|g\rangle }
,
where IP(·,·), (·,·), ⟨·,·⟩ and ⟨·|·⟩ are just different notations for expressing an inner product between two elements in a Hilbert space (or for the first three, in any inner product space). Notational confusion arises when identifying φh and g with ⟨h| and |g⟩ respectively. This is because of literal symbolic substitutions. Let φh = H = ⟨h| and let g = G = |g⟩. This gives

{\displaystyle \phi _{h}(g)=H(g)=H(G)=\langle h|(G)=\langle h|{\bigl (}|g\rangle {\bigr )}\,.}

One ignores the parentheses and removes the double bars. Some properties of this notation are convenient since we are dealing with linear operators and composition acts like a ring multiplication.
Moreover, mathematicians usually write the dual entity not at the first place, as the physicists do, but at the second one, and they usually use not an asterisk but an overline (which the physicists reserve for averages and the Dirac spinor adjoint) to denote complex conjugate numbers; i.e., for scalar products mathematicians usually write

{\displaystyle (\phi ,\psi )=\int \phi (x)\cdot {\overline {\psi (x)}}\,\mathrm {d} x\,,}
