When M > 1 mixture components appear in a state,
then the observation vectors assigned to that state must be
subdivided into M subsets prior to averaging. This is done by
clustering, using, for example, the K-means algorithm with
K ¼ M. If there are Nim vectors assigned to the mth mixture
in state i, then the mixture coefﬁcient cim is reestimated as
cim ¼ Nim=Ni.
