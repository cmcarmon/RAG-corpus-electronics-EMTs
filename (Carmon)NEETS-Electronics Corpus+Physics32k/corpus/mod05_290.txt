hand rule for the polarity of coils. You can see that the instantaneous magnetic polarities of the armature
and field oppose each other, and motor action results. Now, reverse the current by reversing the polarity
of the input. Note that the field magnetic polarity still opposes the armature magnetic polarity. This is
because the reversal effects both the armature and the field. The ac input causes these reversals to take
place continuously.
