The manufacturerâ€™s calibration book is a very important part of the frequency meter package; in fact,
the book is so important that it bears the same serial number as the heterodyne-type frequency meter
itself. Contained in this book is a list of the dial settings and the corresponding frequencies produced by
that meter at those dial settings. Operating instructions for the meter are also included.
