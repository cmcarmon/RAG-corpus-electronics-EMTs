The ﬁrst micromechanical device made by modern manu-
facturing techniques was demonstrated in the mid-1960s. Sig-
niﬁcant commercial production of MEMS started in the 1980s,
with the appearance of pressure sensors for automotive and
medical applications. Then, in the 1990s, microaccelerometers
were mass-produced for air bag triggers in cars. Volume pro-
duction of microﬂuidic devices also began in that decade.
Optical MEMS for displays came to market a few years ago,
and micromirrors for switching signals in ﬁber networks are
poised to enter the volume production stage. MEMS switches
for control of radio-frequency signals and microwave signals is
the next predictable market for MEMS devices. Devices for
dense data storage and many new medical applications are also
in prospect.
