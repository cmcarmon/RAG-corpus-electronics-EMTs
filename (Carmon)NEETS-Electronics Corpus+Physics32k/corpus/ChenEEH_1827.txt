Similar to DiffServ, an MPLS network is divided into
domains with boundary nodes called label edge routers
(LER) and interior nodes called label switching routers
(LSR). Packets entering an MPLS domain are assigned a label
at the ingress LER and are switched inside the domain by a
simple label lookup. The labels determine the quality of service
that the ﬂow receives in the network. The labels are stripped off
the packets at the egress LER, and the packets might be routed
in the conventional fashion before they reach their ﬁnal des-
tination. A sequence of LSRs that is to be followed by a packet
in an MPLS domain is called label switched path (LSP).
Again, similar to DiffServ, to guarantee a certain quality of
service to the packet, both the source and destination have to
be attached to the same MPLS domain, or if they are attached
to different domains, then there should be some service agree-
ment between the two.
