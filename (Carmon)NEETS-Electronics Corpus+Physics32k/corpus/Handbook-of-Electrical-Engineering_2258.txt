Two kinds of superlattices are possible: compositional and doping. Compositional superlattices are made of
alternating layers of semiconductors with different energy gaps. Doping superlattices consist of alternating n-
and p-type layers of the same semiconductor. The potential is modulated by electric ﬁelds arising from the charged
dopants. Compositional superlattices can be grown as lattice matched or as strained layers. The latter are used for
modiﬁcation of the band structure, which depends on the lattice constant to produce desirable properties.
