The signal term power (m) will be proportional to the bandwidth W ; thus, in baseband communication the
signal-to-noise ratio varies only with transmitter gain and channel attenuation and noise level.

Especially for wireless channels, like commercial radio and television, but also for wireline systems like cable
television, an analog message signal must be modulated: The transmitted signalâ€™s spectrum occurs at much
higher frequencies than those occupied by the signal.
