Sublimable transfer dyes have been used for high-quality colored images since the amount of dye transferred
can  be  controlled  somewhat  by  the  energy  supplied  to  the  head  heater  elements. Also,  since  the  sublimable
dyes tend to penetrate into the paper sizing and Ô¨Åbers, a less smooth paper can be used than with waxy materials.
The energy required for dye transfer is similar to that required for waxy ribbons.
