Approximate Approaches
Bojarski’s Identity
Based on the physical optics (PO) approximation, Bojarski
proposed in 1967 the so-called Bojarski’s identity that can be
used to determine the shape function of a conducting object
from the measured back-scattered far-ﬁeld over all frequencies
and all aspect angles. This approach is illustrated in the
following. Consider a conductor of volume V bounded
by the surface S. When this conductor is illuminated by
i Yr , the back-scattered far-
an electromagnetic plane wave
ﬁeld can be expressed as:
