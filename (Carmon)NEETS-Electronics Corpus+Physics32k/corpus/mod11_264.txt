GALLIUM-ARSENIDE FET AMPLIFIERS have been developed which provide low-noise 
amplification up to about 30 dB in the 7- to 18-gigahertz range. The power output of many of these 
amplifiers is relatively low, approximately 20 to 200 milliwatts, but that is satisfactory for many 
microwave applications. Research has extended both the frequency range and the power output of 
gallium-arsenide FET amplifiers to frequencies as high as 26.5 gigahertz and power levels in excess of 1 
watt in multistage amplifiers.
