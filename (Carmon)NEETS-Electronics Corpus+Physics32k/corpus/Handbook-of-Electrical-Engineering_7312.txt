)] can now be written and is shown in Eq. (76.2). This function is
typically used to examine the frequency or time-domain response of a PLL and deÔ¨Ånes the relationship of the
phase of the VCO output signal (
). It also describes the relationship
i
of a change in the output frequency to a change in the input frequency. This function is low-pass in nature.
