A two-state version of the MMSE estimator was ﬁrst applied to speech enhancement by McAulay and Malpass
in 1980 [Ephraim, 1992]. The two states corresponded to speech presence and speech absence (silence) in the
noisy observations. The estimator for the signal given that it is present in the noisy observations was imple-
mented  by  the  spectral  subtraction  approach.  The  estimator  for  the  signal  in  the “silence  state”  is  obviously
equal to zero. This approach signiﬁcantly improved the performance of the spectral subtraction approach.
