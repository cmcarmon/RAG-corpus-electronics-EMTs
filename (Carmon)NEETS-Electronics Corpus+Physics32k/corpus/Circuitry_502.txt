Problems 
 
10.1   Show  how  a  four-input  AND  gate  can  be 
 
10.2   Show  how  a  four-input  OR  gate  can  be 
 
10.3   Construct  the  truth  table  for  the  logic  gate 
 
10.4   Using  only  two-input  NAND  gates,  show 
 
how each of the following logical functions 
can be satisfied: 
 
(a) two-input AND; 
 
(b) two-input OR; 
 
 
(c) four-input AND. 
In  each  case,  use  the  minimum  number  of 
 
gates. (Hint: a two-input NAND gate can be 
 
made into an inverter by connecting its two 
 
 
inputs together) 
10.5   The rocket motor of an air-launched missile 
will  operate  if,  and  only  if,  the  following 
 
conditions are satisfied: 
 
(i) ‘launch’ signal is at logic 1; 
 
 
(ii) ‘unsafe height’ signal is at logic 0; 
(iii) ‘target lock’ signal is at logic 1. 
 
Devise a suitable logic arrangement that will 
 
satisfy 
 
this  requirement.  Simplify  your 
 
answer using the minimum number of logic 
 
gates. 
10.6   An  automatic  sheet  metal  guillotine  will 
operate  if  the  following  conditions  are 
 
satisfied: 
 
 
(i) ‘guard lowered’ signal is at logic 1; 
(ii) ‘feed jam’ signal is at logic 0; 
 
(iii) ‘manual start’ signal is at logic 1. 
 
The sheet  metal  guillotine  will also operate 
 
 
if the following conditions are satisfied: 
(i) ‘manual start’ signal is at logic 1; 
 
(ii) ‘test key’ signal is at logic 1. 
 
Devise a suitable logic arrangement that will 
 
 
satisfy  this  requirement.  Use  the  minimum 
 
number of logic gates. 
10.7   Devise  a  logic  arrangement  using  no  more 
than four two-input gates that will satisfy the 
 
 
truth table shown in Fig. 10.38. 
10.8   Devise a logic arrangement that will produce 
the  output  waveform  from  the  three  input 
 
 
waveforms shown in Fig. 10.39. 
10.9   A logic device is marked ‘74LS90 2798’. To 
 
which family and sub-family of logic does it 
belong 
 
device 
 
manufactured?
