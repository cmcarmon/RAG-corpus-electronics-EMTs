In the standard quark model, Ξ+c comprises a csu quark combination and the Ξ0c comprises a csd quark combination. Both particles decay via the weak interaction. The first observation of the Ξ+c was in 1983 by the WA62 collaboration working at CERN. They found a significant peak in the decay mode ΛK−π+π+ at a mass of 2460±25 MeV/c2. The present value for the mass is taken from an average of 6 experiments, and is 2467.9±0.4 MeV/c2.
The Ξ0c was discovered in 1989 by the CLEO, who measured a peak in the decay mode of Ξ−π+ with a mass of 2471±5 MeV/c2. The accepted value is 2471.0±0.4 MeV/c2.
