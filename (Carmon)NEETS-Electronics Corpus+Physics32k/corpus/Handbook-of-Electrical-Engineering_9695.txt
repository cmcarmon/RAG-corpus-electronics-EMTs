An  individual  component  may  fail  after  a  random  time,  so  it  is  impossible  to  predict  any  pattern  of  failure
from  one  example.  It  is  possible,  however,  to  estimate  the  rate  at  which  members  of  a  group  of  identical
components  will  fail.  This  rate  can  be  determined  by  experimental  means  using  accelerated  life  tests.  In  a
normal operating environment, the time for a statistically signiﬁcant number of failures to have occurred in a
group of modern digital components could be tens or even hundreds of years. Consequently, the manufacturers
must make the environment for the tests extremely unfavorable in order to produce failures in a few hours or
failure
days and then extrapolate back to produce the likely number of failures in a normal environment. The 
rate
 is then deﬁned as the number of failures per unit time, in a given environment, compared with the number
of surviving components. It is usually expressed as a number of failures per million hours.
