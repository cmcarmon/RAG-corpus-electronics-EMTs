This brings us to efficiency. The most efficient device is the one that does the job with the least loss 
of power. One of the largest losses of power is caused by impedance differences between the output of 
one circuit and the input of the next circuit. Perhaps the best way to think of an impedance difference 
(mismatch) between circuits is to think of different-sized water pipes. If you try to connect a one-inch 
water pipe to a two-inch water pipe without an adapter you will lose water. You must use an adapter. A
