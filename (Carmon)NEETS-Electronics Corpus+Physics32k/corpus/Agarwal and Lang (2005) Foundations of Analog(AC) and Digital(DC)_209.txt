It is appropriate at this point to check experimentally the validity of the
models developed here by plotting their v i characteristics. The v i character-
istics can be plotted using the setup shown in Figure 1.33. First, use a 100-
1/10-W resistor as the ‘‘unknown’’ two-terminal device. If the oscillator volt-
age is a few volts, a straight line passing through the origin with slope 1/R
will appear on the screen (see Figure 1.40), showing that Ohm’s law applies.
However, if the voltage is increased so that vD is 5 or 10 V, then the 1/10-W
resistor will heat up, and its value will change. If the oscillator is set to a very
low frequency, say 1 Hz, the resistor heats up and cools down in the source
of each cycle, so the trace is decidedly nonlinear. If the oscillator is in the mid-
audio range, say 500 Hz, thermal inertia prevents the resistor from changing
temperature rapidly, so some average temperature is reached. Thus the line will
remain straight, but its slope will change as a function of the amplitude of the
applied signal.
