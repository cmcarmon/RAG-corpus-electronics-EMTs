One ﬁnal caveat needs to be mentioned with regard to ohmmeters: they only function cor-
rectly when measuring resistance that is not being powered by a voltage or current source. In
other words, you cannot measure resistance with an ohmmeter on a ”live” circuit! The reason
for this is simple: the ohmmeter’s accurate indication depends on the only source of voltage be-
ing its internal battery. The presence of any voltage across the component to be measured will
interfere with the ohmmeter’s operation. If the voltage is large enough, it may even damage
the ohmmeter.
