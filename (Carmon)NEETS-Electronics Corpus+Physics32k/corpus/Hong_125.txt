Feedback systems are analyzed in the frequency domain and provide electronic 
circuit  designers  with  two  important  results:  the  system  response  and  stability.  The 
system  response  is  the  closed-loop  transfer  function  of  the  system  which  in  frequency 
domain  analysis  is  expressed  as  a  ratio  of  output  to  input.  The  stability  of  the  system 
measures  how  likely  spontaneous  oscillations  will  occur,  which  is  most  commonly 
expressed by the metrics of phase margin and gain margin.
