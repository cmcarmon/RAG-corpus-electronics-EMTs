As we discussed voltage and current waves on transmission lines, we pointed out several differences
between open and shorted lines. Basic differences also appear in the standing-wave patterns for open and
shorted lines. You can see these differences by comparing figure 3-29, view E, and figure 3-30. Notice
that the current and voltage standing waves are shifted 90 degrees with respect to the termination. At the
open end of a line, voltage is maximum (zero if there are no losses in the line). At a short circuit, current
is maximum and voltage is minimum.
