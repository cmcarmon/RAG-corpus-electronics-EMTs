From the second intermediate power amplifier, the signal is fed to the KLYSTRON POWER
AMPLIFIER. This stage is a multicavity power klystron. The input rf signal is used as the exciter signal
for the first cavity. High-voltage modulating pulses from the high-voltage modulator are also applied to
the klystron power amplifier. These high-voltage modulating pulses are stepped up across a pulse
transformer before being applied to the klystron. All cavities of the klystron are tunable and are tuned for
maximum output at the desired frequency.
