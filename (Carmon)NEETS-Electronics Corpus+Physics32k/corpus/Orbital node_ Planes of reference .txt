Common planes of reference include the following:
For a geocentric orbit, Earth's equatorial plane. In this case, non-inclined orbits are called equatorial.
For a heliocentric orbit, the ecliptic or invariable plane. In this case, non-inclined orbits are called ecliptic.
For an orbit outside the Solar System, the plane through the primary perpendicular to a line through the observer and the primary (called the plane of the sky).
