Recall, we came across this same damping factor in Equation 12.85 in Chapter 12
from a time-domain point of view. There, in the time domain view, the damping
factor was an indication of how quickly the natural response died out. Notice
the presence of the decaying exponential term containing Î± in Equation 14.21,
the time domain response for our parallel RLC circuit.
