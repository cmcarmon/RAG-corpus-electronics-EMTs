DIELECTRIC LOSSES result from the heating effect on the dielectric material between the
conductors. Power from the source is used in heating the dielectric. The heat produced is dissipated into
the surrounding medium. When there is no potential difference between two conductors, the atoms in the
dielectric material between them are normal and the orbits of the electrons are circular. When there is a
potential difference between two conductors, the orbits of the electrons change. The excessive negative
charge on one conductor repels electrons on the dielectric toward the positive conductor and thus distorts
the orbits of the electrons. A change in the path of electrons requires more energy, introducing a power
loss.
