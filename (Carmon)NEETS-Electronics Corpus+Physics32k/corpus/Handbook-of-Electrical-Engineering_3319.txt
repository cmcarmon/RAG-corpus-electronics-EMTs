Gas-Filled Tubes
The light sensitivity of vacuum phototubes can be increased by adding 0.1 mm pressure of argon. The photo-
electrons under the inﬂuence of the anode voltage accelerate and ionize the gas, creating more electrons. Gains
of  5–10  can  be  realized.  These  devices  are  both  low  frequency,  in  the  10-kHz  range,  and  nonlinear  and  are
suitable  only  for  simple  light  sensors.  Semiconductor  devices  again  are  displacing  these  devices  for  most
applications.
