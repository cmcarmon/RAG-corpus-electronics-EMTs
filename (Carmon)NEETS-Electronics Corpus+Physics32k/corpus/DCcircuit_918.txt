on a nonconducting substrate material called the carrier. The latter form of strain gauge is
represented in the previous illustration. The name ”bonded gauge” is given to strain gauges
that are glued to a larger structure under stress (called the test specimen). The task of bonding
strain gauges to test specimens may appear to be very simple, but it is not. ”Gauging” is a
craft in its own right, absolutely essential for obtaining accurate, stable strain measurements.
It is also possible to use an unmounted gauge wire stretched between two mechanical points
to measure tension, but this technique has its limitations.
