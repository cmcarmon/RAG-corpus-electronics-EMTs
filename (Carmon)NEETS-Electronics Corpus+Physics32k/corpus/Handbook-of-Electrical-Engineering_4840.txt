The equation of state of a crystal subjected to a stress 
 is conveniently formulated in
the isothermal representation. The difference between isothermal and adiabatic changes, however, is negligible
[Keyes, 1960]. Considering only inﬁnitesimal deformations, where the linear theory of elasticity is valid, the
 as [Mason and Thurston,
electric ﬁeld 
1957].
