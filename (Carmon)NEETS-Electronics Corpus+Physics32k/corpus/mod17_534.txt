FREQUENCY CONTROL.â€”The frequency of a radio signal received from a satellite is not 
generally the exact assigned down-link frequency. This variation depends upon the type of orbit of the 
satellite. The greatest frequency variations in signals from satellites occur in medium altitude circular or 
elliptical orbits. The smallest frequency variations occur in signals from satellites in near-synchronous or 
synchronous orbits.
