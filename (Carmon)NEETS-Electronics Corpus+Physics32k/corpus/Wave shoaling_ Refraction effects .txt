Following Phillips (1977) and Mei (1989), denote the phase of a wave ray as




S
=
S
(

x

,
t
)
,
0
≤
S
<
2
π


{\displaystyle S=S(\mathbf {x} ,t),0\leq S<2\pi }
.
The local wave number vector is the gradient of the phase function,





k

=
∇
S


{\displaystyle \mathbf {k} =\nabla S}
,
and the angular frequency is proportional to its local rate of change,




ω
=
−
∂
S

/

∂
t


{\displaystyle \omega =-\partial S/\partial t}
.
Simplifying to one dimension and cross-differentiating it is now easily seen that the above definitions indicate simply that the rate of change of wavenumber is balanced by the convergence of the frequency along a ray;







∂
k


∂
t



+



∂
ω


∂
x



=
0


{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial k}{\partial t}}+{\frac {\partial \omega }{\partial x}}=0}
.
Assuming stationary conditions (



∂

/

∂
t
=
0


{\displaystyle \partial /\partial t=0}
), this implies that wave crests are conserved and the frequency must remain constant along a wave ray as



∂
ω

/

∂
x
=
0


{\displaystyle \partial \omega /\partial x=0}
. As waves enter shallower waters, the decrease in group velocity caused by the reduction in water depth leads to a reduction in wave length



λ
=
2
π

/

k


{\displaystyle \lambda =2\pi /k}
because the nondispersive shallow water limit of the dispersion relation for the wave phase speed,




ω

/

k
≡
c
=


g
h




{\displaystyle \omega /k\equiv c={\sqrt {gh}}}

dictates that




k
=
ω

/



g
h




{\displaystyle k=\omega /{\sqrt {gh}}}
,
i.e., a steady increase in k (decrease in



λ


{\displaystyle \lambda }
) as the phase speed decreases under constant



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }
.
