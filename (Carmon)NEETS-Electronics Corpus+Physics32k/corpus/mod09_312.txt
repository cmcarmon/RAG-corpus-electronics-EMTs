The frequency stability of crystal-controlled oscillators depends on the Q of the crystal. The Q of a 
crystal is very high. It may be more than 100 times greater than that obtained with an equivalent electrical 
circuit. The Q of the crystal is determined by the cut, the type of holder, and the accuracy of grinding. 
Commercially produced crystals range in Q from 5,000 to 30,000 while some laboratory experiment 
crystals range in Q up to 400,000.
