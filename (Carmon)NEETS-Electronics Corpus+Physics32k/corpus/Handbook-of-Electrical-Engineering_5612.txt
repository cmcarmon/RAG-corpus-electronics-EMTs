Field  experience  with  the  computer  relays  has  been  excellent  so  far.  The  manufacturers  of  traditional  relays
have  adopted  this  technology  in  a  big  way.  As  more  experience  is  gained  with  the  special  requirements  of
computer relays, it is likely that other—nontraditional—relay manufacturers will enter the ﬁeld.
