A parallel computer is one that contains more than one CPU. Parallel processing is when
a program is divided into multiple threads of control, each of which is capable of running simultaneously.
On  a  parallel  computer,  multiple  threads  could  be  running  at  the  same  time,  thus  resulting  in  better
performance than on a uniprocessor system.
