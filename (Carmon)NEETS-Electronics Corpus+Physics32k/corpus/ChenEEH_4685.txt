The experimental results (engine speed variations and control
inputs) are plotted in Figure 10.5 The integral term in the
control
law is discretized using the trapezoidal rule with
Dt Â¼ 32 crankshaft degrees, while the control law is calculated
every 120 crankshaft degrees. The electrical load is applied
manually after about 64 engine cycles and removed after
about 183 engine cycles.
