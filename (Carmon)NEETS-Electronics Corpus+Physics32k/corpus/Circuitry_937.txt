Note 
that  a  positive  result  will  be  obtained 
whenever Pout, Vout, or Iout is greater than Pin, Vout,
or  Iout, respectively.  A  negative  result  will  be 
obtained whenever Pout, Vout, or Iout is less than Pin,
Vin  or  Iin. A negative  result  denotes  attenuation 
rather  than  amplification.  A  negative  gain  is  thus 
equivalent to an attenuation (or loss). If desired, the 
formulae  may  be  adapted  to  produce  a  positive
