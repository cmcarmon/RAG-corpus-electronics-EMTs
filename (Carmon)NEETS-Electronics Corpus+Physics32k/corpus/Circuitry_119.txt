The energy stored in an inductor is proportional to 
the product of the inductance and the square of the 
current flowing in it. Thus: 
 
W = Â½ L I 2
where  W is  the  energy  (in  Joules),  L is  the 
capacitance  (in  Henries),  and  I
is  the  current 
flowing in the inductor (in Amps). 
 
Example 2.28 
 
An inductor of 20 mH is required to store 2.5 J of 
energy. Determine the current that must be applied. 
 
Solution 
 
The foregoing formula can be re-arranged to make 
I the subject as follows:
