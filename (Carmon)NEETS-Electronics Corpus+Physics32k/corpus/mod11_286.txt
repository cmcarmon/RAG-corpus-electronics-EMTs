Directional antennas have two characteristics that are important to you in radar and communications 
systems. One is DIRECTIVITY and the other is POWER GAIN. The directivity of an antenna refers to 
the NARROWNESS of the radiated beam. If the beam is NARROW in either the horizontal or vertical 
plane, the antenna has a high degree of directivity in that plane. An antenna may be designed for high 
directivity in one plane only or in both planes, depending on the application. The power gain of an
