The highest development of the long-wire antenna is the RHOMBIC ANTENNA (see figure 4-37). It 
consists of four conductors joined to form a rhombus, or diamond shape. The antenna is placed end to end 
and terminated by a noninductive resistor to produce a uni-directional pattern. A rhombic antenna can be 
made of two obtuse-angle V antennas that are placed side by side, erected in a horizontal plane, and 
terminated so the antenna is nonresonant and unidirectional.
