An Aeolian tone is produced when air passes over an obstacle, resulting in trailing vortices with oscillatory behavior. These eddies can have strong periodic components, resulting in a steady tone. This phenomenon is the main topic of aeroacoustics;
For air moving over a cylinder, empirical data shows that an Aeolian tone will be produced with the frequency

where v is the air velocity, d is the diameter of the cylinder, and α is the Strouhal number, which has a value of about 0.2.
