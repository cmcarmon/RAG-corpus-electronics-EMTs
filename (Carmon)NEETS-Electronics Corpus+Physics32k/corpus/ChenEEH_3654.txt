The basic theoretical unit for describing how speech conveys
linguistic meaning is called a phoneme. For American English,
there are about 42 phonemes which are made up of vowels,
semivowels, diphthongs, and consonants, including nasals,
stops, fricatives, and affricates. Each phoneme can be con-
sidered to be a code that consists of a unique set of articulatory
gestures. These articulatory gestures include the type and loca-
tion of sound excitation as well as the position or movement of
the vocal-tract articulators. We can view a phoneme as an ideal
sound unit with a set of corresponding articulatory gestures. If
speakers could exactly and consistently produce (in the case of
English) these 42 phonemes, then speech would amount to a
stream of discrete codes. Many different factors, including
accents, gender, and coarticulatory effects, ensure that a given
phoneme will have a variety of acoustic manifestations in the
course of ﬂowing speech. From an acoustical point of view,
therefore, the phoneme represents a class of sounds whose
elements convey the same meaning. Accordingly, the phonemes
of a language compose a minimal theoretical set of distinct units
which are sufﬁcient to convey all meaning in the language. This
is to be juxtaposed with the actual sounds that can be produced
which speech scientists call phones. Associated with each
phoneme is a collection of allophones (phone variations) that
represent slight acoustic variations of the basic unit.
