resistor-capacitor circuits, and the L/R time constant associated with first-order
LC, which is the time constant
resistor-inductor circuits. That time constant is
(cid:9)
associated with second-order capacitor-inductor circuits. The third observa-
L/C when associated with second-order
tion is the meaning of the ratio
capacitor-inductor circuits. This ratio is a characteristic of energy storage.
Because wE and wM exchange completely, it follows from Equations 12.21 and
12.22 that
