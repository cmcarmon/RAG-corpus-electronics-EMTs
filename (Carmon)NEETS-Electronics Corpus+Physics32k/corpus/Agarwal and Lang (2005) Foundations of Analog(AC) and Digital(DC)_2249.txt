the diode is OFF, the other when the diode is ON. Analysis of these two
circuits is trivial in this case: For the diode OFF, Figure 16.8a, vra = 0, and
for the diode ON, Figure 16.8b, vrb = vi. Now we must apply the diode
constraints, Equations 4.34 and 4.35, to find which portions of these waveforms
are valid. The ON circuit applies only for iD positive, hence only for vi positive,
as indicated by the darker line segments. The OFF circuit applies only for vD
negative, hence vi negative, so the valid parts of the vr waveform here are again
darkened. The two parts of the solution can now be combined to yield the
complete solution for the output wave, Figure 16.8c.
