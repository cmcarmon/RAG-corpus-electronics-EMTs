Most speakers of the above type receive their input by means of transformer coupling. This is
necessary because of the normal, low impedance of the voice coil. You will find the standard impedance
values for this type speaker are 4, 8, 16, and 32 ohms. Other impedance values may be obtained, but those
listed are the most common.
