some time, MTTR, to repair the system and place it back into operation once again. The system will then be
perfect once again and will operate for a time corresponding to the MTTF before encountering its next failure.
The time between the two failures is the sum of the MTTF and the MTTR and is the MTBF. Thus, the difference
between the MTTF and the MTBF is the MTTR. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the MTBF is given by
