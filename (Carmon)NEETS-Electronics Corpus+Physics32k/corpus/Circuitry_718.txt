Diode ‘go/no-go’ checks 
 
When  the  red  (positive)  side  of  the  ohmmeter  is 
connected  to  the  anode  and  the  black  (negative) 
side  is  connected  to  the  cathode,  the  diode  under 
test  is  forward-biased,  and  the  ohmmeter  will 
indicate  a  low-resistance  reading.  When  the  leads 
are reversed, the diode will be reverse-biased, and 
the  ohmmeter  indicates  a  very  high,  or  infinite 
resistance.  The  ohmmeter  should  be  switched  to 
one of the  middle resistance  ranges (×10, ×100 or 
×1k) for testing diodes.
