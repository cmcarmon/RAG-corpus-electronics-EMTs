Burnout (also burning rubber) is where a vehicle applies sufficient torque to the wheels during acceleration to cause the tire to skid while rotating. The dynamic friction of the spinning tire against the road causes significant amounts of the tire's rubber surface to be deposited onto the road surface, and increased temperature from friction can also create smoke. Unlike accidental skids in steering or braking on slick surfaces, drivers generally cause a burnout on purpose as a showy display of horsepower but it has no practical use.
