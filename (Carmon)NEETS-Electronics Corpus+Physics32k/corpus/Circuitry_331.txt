This  chapter  introduces  the  basic  concepts  of 
amplifiers and amplification.  It describes the  most 
common  types  of  amplifier  and  outlines  the  basic 
classes  of  operation  used  in  both  linear  and  non-
linear  amplifiers.  The  chapter  also  describes 
methods  for  predicting  the  performance  of  an 
amplifier  based  on  equivalent  circuits  and  on  the 
use of semiconductor characteristics and load lines. 
Once  again,  we  conclude  with  a  selection  of 
practical circuits that can be built and tested.
