1. The differential operator is a local rather than global one in contrast to the Green’s function upon which
the integral operator is based. This means that the spatial variation of the ﬁelds must be developed from
sampling  in  as  many  dimensions  as  possessed  by  the  problem,  rather  than  one  less  as  the  IE  model
permits if an appropriate Green’s function is available.
