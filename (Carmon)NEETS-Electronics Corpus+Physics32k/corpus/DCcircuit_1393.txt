Inductor size: Inductors tend to be much larger, physically, than capacitors are for storing
equivalent amounts of energy. This is especially true considering the recent advances in elec-
trolytic capacitor technology, allowing incredibly large capacitance values to be packed into a
small package. If a circuit designer needs to store a large amount of energy in a small vol-
ume and has the freedom to choose either capacitors or inductors for the task, he or she will
most likely choose a capacitor. A notable exception to this rule is in applications requiring
huge amounts of either capacitance or inductance to store electrical energy: inductors made
of superconducting wire (zero resistance) are more practical to build and safely operate than
capacitors of equivalent value, and are probably smaller too.
