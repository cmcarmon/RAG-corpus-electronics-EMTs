Normally one chooses in the GIC band-pass ﬁlter identical
capacitors to save costs: C ¼ C2. Further, it can be shown that
the best choice of resistor values (to make the simulated
inductor optimally insensitive to the ﬁnite gain-bandwidth
product, vt, of the op-amps) is the following:
R1 ¼ R3 ¼ R4 ¼ RL ¼ 1=(v0C2),
