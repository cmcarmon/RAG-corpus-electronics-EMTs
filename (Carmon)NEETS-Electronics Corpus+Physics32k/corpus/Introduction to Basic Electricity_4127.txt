A basic flip-flop circuit produces a square or rect-
angular waveform for use in gating or timing signals 
or for onâ€“off switching operations in binary counter 
circuits. A binary counter circuit is essentially two 
transistor amplifiers, with the output of each transis-
tor coupled to the input of the other transistor. When 
an input signal is applied to the set input, transistor Q1 
turns on, which turns transistor Q2 off. When transis-
tor Q2 turns off, it places a positive potential on the 
base of transistor Q1, holding it on. If a pulse is applied 
to the reset input, it causes transistor Q2 to conduct, 
turning off transistor Q1. Turning off transistor Q1 
holds transistor Q2 on.
