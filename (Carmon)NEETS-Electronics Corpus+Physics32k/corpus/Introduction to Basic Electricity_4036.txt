If the output is taken from an RC network in the 
emitter circuit of the transistor, the output is a saw-
tooth waveshape (Figure 39-15). The RC network 
determines the frequency of oscillation and produces 
the sawtooth output. Transistor Q1 is forward biased 
by resistor R1. As transistor Q1 conducts, capacitor C1 
charges quickly. The positive potential on the top plate 
of capacitor C1 reverse biases the emitter  junction, 
turning off transistor Q1. Capacitor C1 discharges 
through resistor R2, producing the trailing portion of 
the sawtooth output. When capacitor C1 discharges,
