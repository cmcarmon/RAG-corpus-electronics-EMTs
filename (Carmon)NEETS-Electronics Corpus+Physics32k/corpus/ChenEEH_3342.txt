Normally, the power system is operated only at the stable
equilibrium point (us, vs)T . The unstable equilibrium point
(uu, vs)T also plays an important role in determining the large
disturbance response of the system that we study in the next
subsection. Unlike this simple system, assessing the small-
signal stability properties of a realistic large power system is
an extremely challenging task computationally.
