If the move leads to an energetic difference



Δ
U


{\displaystyle \Delta U}
for example due to an electric field or an adsorbing force to the walls. In this case a Metropolis algorithm is applied: The Metropolis rate




p

{\displaystyle p_{M}}
which is defined as





p

T





{\displaystyle p_{M}=e^{-\Delta U/k_{B}T}\,}

is compared to a random number r from the interval [0, 1). If the Metropolis rate is smaller than r the move is rejected, otherwise it is accepted.
The number of Monte Carlo steps of the total system is defined as:

C
S

attempts

monomers






{\displaystyle \#MCS={\frac {\#{\text{ attempts}}}{\#{\text{ monomers}}}}}
