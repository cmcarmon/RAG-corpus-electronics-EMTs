Research  is  occurring  on  all  levels  of  the  memory  hierarchy.  At  the  register  level,  researchers  are  exploring
techniques to provide more registers than are architecturally visible to the compiler. A large volume of work
exists  (and  is  occurring)  for  cache  optimizations  and  alternate  cache  organizations.  For  instance,  modern
processors now commonly split the top level of the cache into separate physical caches, one for instructions
(code) and one for program data. Due to the increasing cost of cache misses (in terms of processor cycles),
some research trades-off increase the complexity of the cache for reducing the miss rate. Two examples of cache
research from opposite ends of the hardware/software spectrum are blocking [Lam, 1901] and skewed-associative
caches  [Seznec,  1993].  Blocking  is  a  software  technique  in  which  the  programmer  or  compiler  reorganizes
algorithms to work on subsets of data that are smaller than the cache, instead of streaming entire large data
structures repeatedly through the cache. This reorganization greatly improves temporal locality. The skewed-
associative cache is one example of a host of hardware techniques that map blocks into the cache differently,
with the goal of reducing misses from conï¬‚icts within a set. In skewed-associative caches, either one of two
