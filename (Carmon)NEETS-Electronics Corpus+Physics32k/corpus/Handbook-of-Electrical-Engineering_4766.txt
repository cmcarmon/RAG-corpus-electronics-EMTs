Figure 49.1(a) represents a hypothetical slab of material in which the dipoles are perfectly arranged. In actual
materials the atoms are not as uniformly arranged, but, nevertheless, from this model there would be a very
strong ﬁeld emanating from the surface of the crystal. The common observation, however, is that the ﬁelds are
either absent or weak. This effective charge neutrality arises from the fact that there are free, mobile charges
available which can be attracted to the surfaces. The polarity of the mobile charges is opposite to the charge
of the free dipole end. The added charges on the two surfaces generate their own ﬁeld, equal and opposite to
the ﬁeld due to the internal dipoles. Thus the effect of the internal ﬁeld is canceled and the external ﬁeld is
zero, as if no charges were present at all [Fig. 49.1(b)].
