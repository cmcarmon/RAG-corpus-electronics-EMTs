Few technological advances can result in as many time-savings for worldwide daily life as advances in modem
information rates. However, modem designers are faced with a fundamental limitation in the maximum trans-
missible information rate. Every communication channel has a number associated with it called channel capacity,
which determines the maximum information rate that can ﬂow through the channel regardless of the complexity
of the transmitting and receiving devices. Thus, the progression of modem rates shown in Fig. 73.12 is sure to
come to a halt. But, at what rate? Answering this question for any communication channel model is one of the
major goals of information theory—a discipline founded in 1948 by Claude E. Shannon [Shannon, 1948].
