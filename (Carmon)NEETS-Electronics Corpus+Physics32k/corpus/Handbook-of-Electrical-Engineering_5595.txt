In  a  three-phase  power  system,  10  types  of  faults  are  possible:  three  single  phase-to-ground  faults,  three
phase-to-phase faults, three double phase-to-ground faults, and one three-phase fault. It turns out that relays
responsive to the ratio of delta voltages and delta currents measure the correct distance to all multiphase faults.
The delta quantities are deﬁned as the difference between any two phase quantities; for example, Ea – Eb is the
delta voltage between a and b phases. Thus for a multiphase fault between phases x and y,
