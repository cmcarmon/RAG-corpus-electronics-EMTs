When an input signal to one amplifier is large enough, the transistor can be driven into cutoff, and its 
collector voltage will be almost V CC. However, when the transistor is driven into saturation, its collector 
voltage will be about 0 volts. A circuit that is designed to go quickly from cutoff to saturation will 
produce a square or rectangular wave at its output. This principle is used in multivibrators.
