and is not permanent, as it is in the ferroelectric materials, electrostrictive materials have essentially no hysteresis.
Unlike PZT, electrostrictive materials are not reversible; PZT will change shape on application of a ﬁeld and
generate a ﬁeld when a strain is induced. Electrostrictive materials only change shape on application of a ﬁeld
and, therefore, cannot be used as receivers. PZT has inherently large hysteresis because of the domain nature
of the polarization.
