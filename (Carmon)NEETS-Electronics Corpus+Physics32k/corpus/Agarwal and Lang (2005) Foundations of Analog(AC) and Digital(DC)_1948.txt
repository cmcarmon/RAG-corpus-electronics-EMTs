We will now discuss another implementation of the amplifier circuit based
on an input coupling capacitor as shown in Figure 13.39a. This circuit makes use
of the fact that most small-signal inputs of interest are time-varying signals with
a reasonably high-frequency content. As illustrated in Figure 13.39b, a small-
signal input can be fed directly to the input port of the amplifier in Figure 13.39a,
even if the small signal is superimposed over some DC bias voltage. As we will
show shortly, the capacitor C and the resistors R1 and R2 filter out any DC
bias voltage over which the small signal is superimposed, and pass through the
time-varying small signal. Furthermore, we will show that the resistive divider
formed by R1 and R2 provides the necessary input bias voltage.
