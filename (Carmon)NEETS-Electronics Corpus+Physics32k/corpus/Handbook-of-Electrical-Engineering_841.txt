The root-locus technique was another popular technique for assessing stability. It furthermore allowed the
engineer to see the effects of small changes in the gain, K, on the stability of the system. The root-locus diagram
shows the location in the s-plane of the poles of the closed-loop transfer function, Y(s)/U(s). All branches of
the root-locus diagram start on poles of the open-loop transfer function, KGH, and end either on zeros of the
open-loop transfer function, KGH, or at inÔ¨Ånity. There are about a dozen rules to help draw these trajectories.
The root-locus technique is discussed in Chapter 93.4.
