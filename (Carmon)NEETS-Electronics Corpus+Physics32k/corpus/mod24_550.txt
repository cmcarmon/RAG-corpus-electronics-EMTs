Figure 5-13 shows an example OTDR trace of an installed cable plant. OTDR traces can have
several common characteristics. An OTDR trace begins with an initial input pulse. This pulse is a result
of Fresnel reflection occurring at the connection to the OTDR. Following this pulse, the OTDR trace is a
gradual downsloping curve interrupted by abrupt shifts. Periods of gradual decline in the OTDR trace
result from Rayleigh scattering as light travels along each fiber section of the cable plant. Periods of
gradual decline are interrupted by abrupt shifts called point defects. A point defect is a temporary or
permanent local deviation of the OTDR signal in the upward or downward direction. Point defects are
caused by connectors, splices, or breaks along the fiber length. Point defects, or faults, can be reflective or
nonreflective. An output pulse at the end of the OTDR trace indicates the end of the fiber cable plant.
This output pulse results from Fresnel reflection occurring at the output fiber-end face.
