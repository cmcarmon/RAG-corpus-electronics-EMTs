Perhaps the fastest method of BER estimation is the semi-analytic (SA) or quasi-analytic technique [Jeruchim,
1984]. This technique is useful for systems that resemble Fig. 78.10. In this case the mean of the decision metric
is a function of the transmitted data pattern and is independent of the noise. All other parameters of the pdf
of the decision metric are a function of the noise and are independent of the data. This means that one can
analytically determine the conditional pdf of the decision metric given the transmitted data pattern. By using
total probability one can then determine the unconditional error rate. The problem with conventional math-
ematical analysis is that when the channel has a signiÔ¨Åcant amount of memory or the nonlinearity is rather
