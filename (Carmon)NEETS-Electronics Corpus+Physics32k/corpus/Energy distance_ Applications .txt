Applications include
Hierarchical clustering (a generalization of Ward's method)
Testing multivariate normality
Testing the multi-sample hypothesis of equal distributions,
Change point detection
Multivariate independence:
distance correlation,
Brownian covariance.

Scoring rules:
Gneiting and Raftery apply energy distance to develop a new and very general type of proper scoring rule for probabilistic predictions, the energy score.
Robust statistics
Gene selection
Microarray data analysis
Material structure analysis
Applications of energy statistics are implemented in the open source energy package for R.
