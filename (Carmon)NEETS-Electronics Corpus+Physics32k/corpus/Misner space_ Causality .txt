Misner space is a standard example for the study of causality since it contains both closed timelike curves and a compactly generated Cauchy horizon, while still being flat (since it is just Minkowski space). With the coordinates



(

t
′

,
φ
)


{\displaystyle (t',\varphi )}
, the loop defined by



t
=
0
,
φ
=
λ


{\displaystyle t=0,\varphi =\lambda }
, with tangent vector



X
=
(
0
,
1
)


{\displaystyle X=(0,1)}
, has the norm



g
(
X
,
X
)
=
0


{\displaystyle g(X,X)=0}
, making it a closed null curve. This is the chronology horizon : there are no closed timelike curves in the region



t
<
0


{\displaystyle t<0}
, while every point admits a closed timelike curve through it in the region



t
>
0


{\displaystyle t>0}
.
This is due to the tipping of the light cones which, for



t
<
0


{\displaystyle t<0}
, remains above lines of constant



t


{\displaystyle t}
but will open beyond that line for



t
>
0


{\displaystyle t>0}
, causing any loop of constant



t


{\displaystyle t}
to be a closed timelike curve.
