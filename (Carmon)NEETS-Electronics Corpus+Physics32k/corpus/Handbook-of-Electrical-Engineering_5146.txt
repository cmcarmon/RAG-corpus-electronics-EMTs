An electrorheological ﬂuid requires particles (1 to 100 mm in diameter) dispersed in a carrier ﬂuid. Sometimes
a surfactant is also added to help the dispersion of particles in the ﬂuid. The surfactant is used to prevent particle
interaction that could otherwise result in a tendency for the particulates to clump together when the ﬂuid is allowed
to stand still over a stretch of time. The tendency of the particles to clump together is referred to as settling.
