when a conductive surface, such as an airplane, appears in the signal path. While the antenna
is continuously rotated in search of a target, the antenna is stopped when the target is located.
It is pointed toward the target by varying its angular direction until a maximum echo is heard.
The position coordinate θ(t) of the antenna is usually controlled through a gear train by a dc
servomotor. The motor torque is varied in both magnitude and direction by means of a control
voltage obtained from the ampliﬁer output. The control problem is then to command the motor
such that the output θ(t) is nearly the same as the reference angular position θ r(t). The closed
loop can be controlled by a digital controller.
