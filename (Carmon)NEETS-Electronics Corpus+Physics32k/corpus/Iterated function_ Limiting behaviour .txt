Upon iteration, one may find that there are sets that shrink and converge towards a single point. In such a case, the point that is converged to is known as an attractive fixed point. Conversely, iteration may give the appearance of points diverging away from a single point; this would be the case for an unstable fixed point. When the points of the orbit converge to one or more limits, the set of accumulation points of the orbit is known as the limit set or the Ï‰-limit set.
The ideas of attraction and repulsion generalize similarly; one may categorize iterates into stable sets and unstable sets, according to the behaviour of small neighborhoods under iteration. (Also see Infinite compositions of analytic functions.)
Other limiting behaviours are possible; for example, wandering points are points that move away, and never come back even close to where they started.
