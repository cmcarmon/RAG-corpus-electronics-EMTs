A pulse-type radar set transmits a short burst of electromagnetic energy. Target range is determined
by measuring elapsed time while the pulse travels to and returns from the target. Because two-way travel
is involved, a total time of 12.36 (6.18 x 2) microseconds per nautical mile will elapse between the start of
the pulse from the antenna and its return to the antenna from a target. This 12.36 microsecond time
interval is sometimes referred to as a RADAR MILE, RADAR NAUTICAL MILE, or NAUTICAL
RADAR MILE. The range in nautical miles to an object can be found by measuring the elapsed time
during a round trip of a radar pulse and dividing this quantity by 12.36. In equation form, this is:
