Optical fibers have small cross sectional areas. Without protection, optical fibers are fragile and can
be broken. The optical cable structure protects optical fibers from environmental damage. Cable structure
includes buffers, strength members, and jackets. Many factors influence the design of fiber optic cables.
The cable design relates to the cable's intended application. Properly designed optical cables perform the
following functions:
