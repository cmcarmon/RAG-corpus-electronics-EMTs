The center hole in a ceramic ferrule is created by forming the ferrule around a precision wire, which
is then removed. This method produces holes accurately centered in the ferrule. Most cylindrical ferrule
connectors now use ceramic ferrules. The Straight Tip (STÃ’ connector is an example of a ceramic ferrule
connector. (ST is a registered trademark of AT&T.)
