Many electrical devices tolerate real currents of either direction with no difference in op-
eration. Incandescent lamps (the type utilizing a thin metal ﬁlament that glows white-hot
with sufﬁcient current), for example, produce light with equal efﬁciency regardless of current
direction. They even function well on alternating current (AC), where the direction changes
rapidly over time. Conductors and switches operate irrespective of current direction, as well.
The technical term for this irrelevance of charge ﬂow is nonpolarization. We could say then,
that incandescent lamps, switches, and wires are nonpolarized components. Conversely, any
device that functions differently on currents of different direction would be called a polarized
device.
