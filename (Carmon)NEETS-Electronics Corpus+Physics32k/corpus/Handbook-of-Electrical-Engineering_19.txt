The  resistor  is  an  electrical  device  whose  primary  function  is  to  introduce  resistance  to  the  ﬂow  of  electric
current.  The  magnitude  of  opposition  to  the  ﬂow  of  current  is  called  the  resistance  of  the  resistor. A  larger
resistance value indicates a greater opposition to current ﬂow.
