Speciﬁc cost of solar cell technology (dollars per kilowatt) is still very high, with little
prospect of signiﬁcant decrease barring some kind of revolutionary advance in technology. Un-
like electronic components made from semiconductor material, which can be made smaller and
smaller with less scrap as a result of better quality control, a single solar cell still takes the
same amount of ultra-pure silicon to make as it did thirty years ago. Superior quality control
fails to yield the same production gain seen in the manufacture of chips and transistors (where
isolated specks of impurity can ruin many microscopic circuits on one wafer of silicon). The
same number of impure inclusions does little to impact the overall efﬁciency of a 3-inch solar
cell.
