The Thévenin equivalent at the fault point is determined by normal sinusoidal steady-state methods, resulting
in  a  ﬁrst-order  circuit  as  shown  in  Fig. 61.38.  While  this  provides  satisfactory  results  for  the  steady-state
component Iac, the X/R value so obtained can be in serious error when compared with the rate of decay of I(t)
as measured by oscillographs on an actual faulted system. The major reasons for the discrepancy are, ﬁrst of
all, that the system, for transient analysis purposes, is actually high-order, and second, the generators do not
hold constant impedance as the transient decays.
