The cathode structure is manufactured in two parts. Point A of figure 2-13 is the metallic shell of the
tube and is used to couple (or connect) unwanted radio frequency signals from the cathode to ground.
This connection is not, however, a direct coupling. The wafer at point C of figure 2-13 is composed of
mica, which serves as a dielectric. The lower extension of the cathode serves as one plate of the capacitor,
while the other plate is formed from the flattened upper portion of the cathode connector ring. The
cathode has a direct connection to the tube pin through the connector labeled point B. You might think
that this is a rather complicated method to connect the cathode to a circuit, but it serves a purpose. At high
frequencies, the wiring of a circuit can pick up radio frequency signals and retransmit them. If the wiring
involved happens to be the wiring used to supply dc voltages to the circuit, all the tubes in the circuit will
receive the signal. The result will be massive distortion throughout the circuit.
