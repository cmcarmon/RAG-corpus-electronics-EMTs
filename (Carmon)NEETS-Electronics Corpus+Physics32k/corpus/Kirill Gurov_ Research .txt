Kirill Gurov and Nikolay Bogolyubov obtained kinetic equations for quantum systems by developing the method of quantum BBGKY hierarchy.
At the IMMS, Kirill Gurov worked on analysis of the diffusion processes and the corresponding phase transitions in alloys. Since the middle of the 1970s, he worked on developing materials for space projects, participated in the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, and studied the effects of zero gravity on material properties.
