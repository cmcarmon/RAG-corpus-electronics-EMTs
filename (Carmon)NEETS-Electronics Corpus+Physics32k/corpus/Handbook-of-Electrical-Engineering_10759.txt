The  a  posteriori  failure  probability  Qc(t)  is  independent  of  the  prior  operating  time  T,  indicating  that  the
component does not degrade no matter how long it operates. Obviously, such a scenario is valid only during
the useful lifetime (horizontal portion of the bathtub curve) of the component.
