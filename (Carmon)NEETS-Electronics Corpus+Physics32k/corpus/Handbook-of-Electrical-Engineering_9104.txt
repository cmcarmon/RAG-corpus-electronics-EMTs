ﬁltered and decoded by the card’s I/O device. Transmission of the data from the card to the terminal is based
on the passive amplitude modulation of the main carrier, which is executed by changing the card’s I/O circuit
impedance differently for “0” and “1.” To read the information, a reader must be able to detect a potential drop
in the impedance in its internal AC generator.
