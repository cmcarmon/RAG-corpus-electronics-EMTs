of some physical quantity. For example, you can determine the number of boards in a picket fence by 
either a digital or an analog system as follows. In the digital method (fig. 1-5, view A), you use an adding 
machine and count the boards one by one. In the analog method (fig. 1-5, view B), you draw a string 
(marked off in inches for the width of each board including the gap) over the length of the fence, then 
measure the length of the string. The number of boards may then be determined by dividing the length of 
string by the number of inches per board.
