You might want to confirm that Equation 10.61 combined with the appropriate
boundary conditions results in the same solutions as obtained by solving the
differential equations in the previous sections. For example, for the RC discharge
transient example of Section 10.1.2, the initial capacitor voltage is given as
vC(0) and the final value is zero. Substituting VO = vC(0) and V = 0 into
Equation 10.61, we obtain
