One additional handling procedure you should be aware of is how to dispose of a CRT properly.
When you replace a CRT, you cannot simply throw the old CRT over the side of the ship, or place it in
the nearest dumpster. When thrown over the side of a ship, a CRT will float; if it washes ashore, it is
dangerous to persons who may come in contact with it. A CRT thrown in a dumpster represents a hidden
booby trap. Therefore, always render the CRT harmless before you dispose of it. This is a fairly simple
procedure, as outlined below.
