To speed up the compilation and validation process, Luk
et al. (1999) have developed a tool kit for automating the
quality assurance of intellectual property cores. Designs can
be validated in various ways, including functional simulation,
timing analysis, automated theorem proving, and execution on
a hardware platform such as the system shown in Figure 3.5.
Their work is being extended to cover reconÔ¨Ågurable designs.
