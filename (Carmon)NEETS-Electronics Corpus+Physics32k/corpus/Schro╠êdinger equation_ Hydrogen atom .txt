This form of the Schrödinger equation can be applied to the hydrogen atom:

{\displaystyle E\psi =-{\frac {\hbar ^{2}}{2\mu }}\nabla ^{2}\psi -{\frac {e^{2}}{4\pi \varepsilon _{0}r}}\psi }

where e is the electron charge, r is the position of the electron (r = |r| is the magnitude of the position), the potential term is due to the Coulomb interaction, wherein ε0 is the electric constant (permittivity of free space) and

{\displaystyle \mu ={\frac {m_{e}m_{p}}{m_{e}+m_{p}}}}

is the 2-body reduced mass of the hydrogen nucleus (just a proton) of mass mp and the electron of mass me. The negative sign arises in the potential term since the proton and electron are oppositely charged. The reduced mass in place of the electron mass is used since the electron and proton together orbit each other about a common centre of mass, and constitute a two-body problem to solve. The motion of the electron is of principle interest here, so the equivalent one-body problem is the motion of the electron using the reduced mass.
The wavefunction for hydrogen is a function of the electron's coordinates, and in fact can be separated into functions of each coordinate. Usually this is done in spherical polar coordinates:

where R are radial functions and Ymℓ(θ, φ) are spherical harmonics of degree ℓ and order m. This is the only atom for which the Schrödinger equation has been solved for exactly. Multi-electron atoms require approximative methods. The family of solutions are:
