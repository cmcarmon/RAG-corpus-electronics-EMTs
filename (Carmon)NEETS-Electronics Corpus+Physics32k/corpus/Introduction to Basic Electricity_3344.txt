A properly biased SCR is shown in Figure 33-6. 
The switch is used to apply and remove gate voltage. 
The resistor RG is used to limit current to the speci-
fied gate current. The anode-to-cathode voltage is pro-
vided by the AC voltage source. The series resistor (RL) 
is used to limit the anode-to-cathode current to the 
specified gate current when the device is turned on. 
Without  resistor RL the SCR would conduct an anode-
to- cathode current high enough to damage the SCR.
