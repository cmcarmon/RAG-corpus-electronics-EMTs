The electrons keep flowing as long as the battery is connected in a circuit 
and the electrochemical reactions continue to take place. As the chemicals 
become depleted, fewer reactions take place, and the batteryâ€™s voltage starts 
to drop. Eventually, the battery can no longer generate electrical energy, and 
we say that the battery is flat or dead.
