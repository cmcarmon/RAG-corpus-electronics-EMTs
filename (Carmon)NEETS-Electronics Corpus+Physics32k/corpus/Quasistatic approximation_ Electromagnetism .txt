In classical electromagnetism, there are at least two consistent quasistatic approximations of Maxwell equations : quasi-electrostatics and quasi-magnetostatics depending on the relative importance of the two dynamic coupling terms. These approximations can be obtained using time constants evaluations or can be shown to be Galilean limits of electromagnetism.
