For example, in the analysis and simulation of a three-phase synchronous machine with a salient pole rotor,
transformation of stator quantities onto a frame of reference attached to the asymmetrical rotor results in a
much simpler model. In this rotor reference model, the inductances are not dependent on rotor position and,
in steady-state operation, the stator voltages and currents are not time varying.
