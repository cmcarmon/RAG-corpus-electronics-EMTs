The second step is to check the energizing voltage with a voltmeter. If the voltage is too low, the
result is less current flowing through the coil and a weak magnetic field. A weak magnetic field can result
in slow or poor operation. Low voltage could also result in chatter or no operation at all. If the energizing
voltage is too high, it could damage the solenoid by causing overheating or arcing. In either case, the
voltage should be reset to the proper value so that further damage or failure of the solenoid will not result.
