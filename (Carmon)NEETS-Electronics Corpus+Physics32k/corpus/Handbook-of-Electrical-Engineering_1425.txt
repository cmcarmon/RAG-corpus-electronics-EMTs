is another function which is often used in estimating the pitch of voiced speech. An example of the AMDF is
shown in Fig. 15.9 for the same 64-ms frame of the /i/ phoneme. However, the minima of the AMDF is used
as an indicator of the pitch period. The AMDF has been shown to be a good pitch period indicator [Ross et al.,
1974] and does not require multiplications.
