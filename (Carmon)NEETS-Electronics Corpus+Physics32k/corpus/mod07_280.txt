Some of the symbols used to represent Zener diodes are illustrated in figure 3-4 (view A, view B, 
view C, view D, and view E). Note that the polarity markings indicate electron flow is with the arrow 
symbol instead of against it as in a normal PN-junction diode. This is because breakdown diodes are 
operated in the reverse-bias mode, which means the current flow is by minority current carriers.
