where the primed coordinates refer to the position of the
differential element of charge being integrated, and the un-
primed coordinates refer to the position of the observation
point, as suggested in Figure 2.3.
When the charge distribution is volumetric, the elementary
differential element of charge is dq ¼ rdv0. For surface charge
distributions, dq ¼ sdS0; for lineal charge distributions, the
element is ldl0. The meaning and usefulness of equation 2.10
can be illustrated with the following two examples.
