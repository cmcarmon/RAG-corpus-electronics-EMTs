The small-signal equivalent circuit also allows us to determine other important
circuit parameters, such as the small-signal input resistance, output resistance,
current gain, and power gain. Since the amplifier behaves as a linear network
for small signals, it can be characterized by a Thévenin equivalent when viewed
from any given port. The input and output resistance come in handy in this
Thévenin characterization. Let us determine these values for the MOSFET
amplifier using its small-signal circuit in Figure 8.16. Since these parameters are
externally observed quantities, they are defined with respect to the external ports
of the amplifier abstraction. Thus, it is important that we define precisely what
constitutes the input and output ports of the small-signal amplifier. Figure 8.19
shows the relationship between the external ports of the amplifier circuit and the
small-signal model. Notice that we have internalized the input bias voltage into
the small-signal amplifier abstraction so the user of the amplifier does not have to
provide the appropriate input bias voltage. Instead, the user can simply provide
a small input signal and observe the resulting signal output superimposed on
the DC output offset.
