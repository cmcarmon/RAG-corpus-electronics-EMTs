and not to the absolute electric potential at either terminal. Fourth, the current is
defined to circulate positively through the port by entering the positive voltage
terminal and exiting the negative voltage terminal. Which terminal is chosen as
the positive voltage terminal is arbitrary, but the relation defined between the
current and voltage is not. Lastly, for brevity, the current that exits the negative
voltage terminal is usually never labeled, but it is always understood to be equal
to the current that enters the positive voltage terminal.
