magine the world without the amazing electronics building block known 
as the transistor. Your cellphone would be the size of a washing machine, 
your laptop wouldn’t fit on your lap (or in a single room), your iPod would be 
just another pie‐in‐the‐sky idea — and your Apple stock would be 
worthless.
