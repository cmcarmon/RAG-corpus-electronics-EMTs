The original theory of MOND by Milgrom was developed in 1983 as an alternative to "dark matter". Departures from Newton's law of gravitation are governed by an acceleration scale, not a distance scale. MOND successfully explains the Tully-Fisher observation that the luminosity of a galaxy should scale as the fourth power of the rotation speed. It also explains why the rotation discrepancy in dwarf galaxies is particularly large.
There were several problems with MOND in the beginning.
It did not include relativistic effects
It violated the conservation of energy, momentum and angular momentum
It was inconsistent in that it gives different galactic orbits for gas and for stars
It did not state how to calculate gravitational lensing from galaxy clusters.
By 1984, problems 2 and 3 had been solved by introducing a Lagrangian (AQUAL). A relativistic version of this based on scalar-tensor theory was rejected because it allowed waves in the scalar field to propagate faster than light. The Lagrangian of the non-relativistic form is:

{\displaystyle L=-{a_{0}^{2} \over 8\pi G}f\left\lbrack {\frac {|\nabla \phi |^{2}}{a_{0}^{2}}}\right\rbrack -\rho \phi }

The relativistic version of this has:

is the MOND length scale.
By 1988, a second scalar field (PCC) fixed problems with the earlier scalar-tensor version but is in conflict with the perihelion precession of Mercury and gravitational lensing by galaxies and clusters.
By 1997, MOND had been successfully incorporated in a stratified relativistic theory [Sanders], but as this is a preferred frame theory it has problems of its own.
Bekenstein (2004) introduced a tensor-vector-scalar model (TeVeS). This has two scalar fields
