A schematic diagram for a cumulatively compounded dc motor is shown in Figure 13.4.8(c).
The operating characteristics of such a machine lie between those of the shunt and series motors,
as shown in Figure 13.4.9. (The differentially compounded motor has little application, since
it is inherently unstable, particularly at high loads.) Figure 13.4.10 compares the speedâ€“torque
characteristics of various types of electric motors; 1.0 per unit represents rated values.
