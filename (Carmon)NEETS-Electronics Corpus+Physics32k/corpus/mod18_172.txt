Relatively low transmitter frequencies are used in 2D search radars to permit long-range
transmissions with minimum attenuation. Wide pulse widths and high peak power are used to aid in
detecting small objects at great distances. Low pulse-repetition rates are selected to permit greater
maximum range. A wide vertical-beam width is used to ensure detection of objects from the surface to
relatively high altitudes and to compensate for pitch and roll of own ship. The output characteristics of
specific air-search radars are classified; therefore, they will not be discussed.
