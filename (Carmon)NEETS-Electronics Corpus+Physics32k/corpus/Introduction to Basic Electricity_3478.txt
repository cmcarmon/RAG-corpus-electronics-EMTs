Inside an integrated circuit, a static discharge could 
destroy oxide layers or junctions. These static dis-
charges can create an ESD latent defect, causing the 
device to appear to operate properly even though it is 
damaged. It has been weakened and failure will result 
at a later time. There is no method for testing for an 
ESD latent defect.
