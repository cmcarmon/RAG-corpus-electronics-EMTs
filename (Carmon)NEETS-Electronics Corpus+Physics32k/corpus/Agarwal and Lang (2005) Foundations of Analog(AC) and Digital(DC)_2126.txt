If we use the Op Amp model in Figure 15.6, hereafter referred to as the
ideal Op Amp model, then the circuit model for the inverting amplifier is as
shown in Figure 15.8b. Following the same analysis method as before, we will
derive three independent equations relating the three unknown node voltages
