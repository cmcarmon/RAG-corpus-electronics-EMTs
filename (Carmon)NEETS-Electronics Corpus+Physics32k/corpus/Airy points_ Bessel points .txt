"Line standards" are measured between lines marked on their surfaces. They are much less convenient to use than end standards but, when the marks are placed on the neutral plane of the beam, allow greater accuracy.
To support a line standard, one wishes to minimise the linear, rather than angular, motion of the ends. The Bessel points (after Friedrich Bessel) are the points at which the length of the beam is maximized. Because this is a maximum, the effect of a small positioning error is proportional to the square of the error, an even smaller amount.
The Bessel points are located 0.5594 of the length of the rod apart, slightly closer than the Airy points.
Because line standards invariably extend beyond the lines marked on them, the optimal support points depend on both the overall length and the length to be measured. The latter is the quantity to be maximized, requiring a more complex calculation. For example, the 1927â€“1960 definition of the metre specified that the International Prototype Metre bar was to be measured while "supported on two cylinders of at least one centimetre diameter, symmetrically placed in the same horizontal plane at a distance of 571 mm from each other." Those would be the Bessel points of a beam 1020 mm long.
