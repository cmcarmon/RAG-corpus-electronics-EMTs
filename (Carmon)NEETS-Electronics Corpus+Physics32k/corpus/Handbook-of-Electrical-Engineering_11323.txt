Capacitor
The function of the capacitor is to store the energy generated from the high-voltage charging circuitry and to
deliver  that  energy  on  demand  to  the  heart  over  a  few  milliseconds.  The  commercially  available  aluminum
electrolytic  photoﬂash  capacitor  is  currently  used  in  the  ICD.  This  is  because  of  its  high  energy  density  of
1.7 J/cm3 made  possible  due  to  special  etching  techniques  that  maximize  surface  area  in  the  aluminum  foil.
Because  the  capacitors  are  commercially  available  and  are  not  custom-designed  for  deﬁbrillators,  there  are
several  shortcomings  that  ICD  manufacturers  must  deal  with.  Since  the  highest  energy  density  aluminum
electrolytic capacitors are designed to operate at around 375 V, two of these capacitors must be used in series
to attain the necessary 750 V used in most designs; therefore, the capacitors play a major role in determining
the  size  of  the  deﬁbrillator.  Their  geometry  is  not  ideal  for  efﬁcient  packaging.  The  round  shape  results  in
wasted space in the ICD. Perhaps the greatest shortcoming is the requirement that the capacitor be reformed
after periods of no use to ensure there is no leakage current during charging. This involves automatic application
of  the  rated  voltage  to  the  capacitor  for  a  few  minutes  every  few  weeks  in  order  to  repair  damage  that  has
occurred due to aging. The latest generation capacitors have minimized the need for reforming. As mentioned
before, because the battery requires reforming as well, the energy is not completely wasted. Current research
in  capacitors  is  centered  on  reducing  the  size  by  increasing  the  energy  density  and  eliminating  the  need  for
reforming.
