Time	availability	(of	the	creator)	–	although	it	can	be	completed	quickly,	a
circuit	project	shouldn’t	be	rushed;	the	project	creator	should	be	available
for	a	set	period	so	he	can	concentrate	properly	on	a	circuit.	Especially	if	he
has	hardly	any	time	to	spare,	it’s	suggested	that	he	either	determines	a	way
to	find	additional	time,	or	takes	on	a	different	project
Difficulty	level	–	the	assessment	of	a	circuit	project	is	important	prior	to
acceptance.	While	there	are	simple	ones,	some	projects	are	rather
complicated.	If	a	creator	is	certain	that	he	can’t	follow	through	the
procedures	of	a	particular	project,	he	may	want	to	consider	other
undertakings
Total	cost	of	the	project	–	one	reason	that	the	creation	of	a	schematic
diagram	and	other	preparations	are	suggested	(prior	to	taking	on	a	circuit
project)	is	due	to	practicality	regarding	the	overall	expenses.	As	much	as
possible,	the	creator	should	consider	his	ability	to	fund	a	project.	Especially
if	he	plans	on	using	expensive	circuit	components,	he	needs	to	think	about
whether	he	can	afford	the	project	until	completion.
The	desired	function	–	identify	the	reason	why	you	took	on	the	project.	Is	it
for	experimentation	and	personal	use?	Or,	was	it	a	request	from	a
company?	Especially	if	the	purpose	is	for	a	commercial	company,	design	a
circuit	to	achieve	first-rate	quality.
