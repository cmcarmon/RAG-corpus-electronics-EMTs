Solution: The ratio B/C is the cosine function. By checking the table of functions, you will find that
the cosine of 33º  is 0.8387. This means that the length of B is 0.8387 the length of side C. If side C is 10
inches long, then side B must be 10 × 0.8387, or 8.387 inches in length.  To determine the length of side
A, use the sine function, the ratio A\C. Again consulting the table of functions, you will find that the sine
of 33º  is 0.5446. Thus, side A must be 10 × 0.5446, or 5.446 inches in length.
