There are three types of operational envelope in the Six degrees of freedom. These types are Direct, Semi-direct (conditional) and Non-direct, all regardless of the time remaining for the execution of the maneuver, the energy remaining to execute the maneuver and finally, if the motion is commanded via a biological entity (e.g. human), a robotical entity (e.g. computer) or both.
1- Direct type : Involved a degree can be commanded directly without particularly conditions and described as a normal operation. (An aileron on a basic airplane)
2- Semi-direct type : Involved a degree can be commanded when some specific conditions are met. (Reverse thrust on an aircraft)
3- Non-direct type : Involved a degree when is achieved via the interaction with its environment and cannot be commanded. (Pitching motion of a vessel at sea)
Transitional type also exists in some vehicles. For example, when the Space Shuttle operates in space, the craft is described as fully-direct-six because its six degrees can be commanded. However, when the Space Shuttle is in the earth's atmosphere for its return, the fully-direct-six degrees are no longer applicable for many technical reasons.
