Dissipated power in a resistance manifests itself in the form of heat, and excessive heat
can be damaging to a wire (not to mention objects near the wire!), especially considering the
fact that most wires are insulated with a plastic or rubber coating, which can melt and burn.
Thin wires will, therefore, tolerate less current than thick wires, all other factors being equal.
A conductorâ€™s current-carrying limit is known as its ampacity.
