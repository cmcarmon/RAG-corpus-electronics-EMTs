Figures 1.1 and 1.3 show possible course sequences that students might
encounter in an EECS (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) or an EE
(Electrical Engineering) curriculum, respectively, to illustrate how each of the
courses introduces several abstraction layers to simplify the building of useful
electronic systems. This sequence of courses also illustrates how a circuits and
electronics course using this book might fit within a general EE or EECS course
framework.
