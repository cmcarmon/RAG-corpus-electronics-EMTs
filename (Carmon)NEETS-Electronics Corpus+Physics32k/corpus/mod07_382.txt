The MOSFET is an FET that has even higher input impedances than the JFET because the gate of 
the MOSFET is completely insulated from the rest of the device. The MOSFET operates in either the 
depletion mode or the forward-bias enhancement mode and can be either N-channel or P-channel. The 
induced-channel and the dual-gate MOSFETs are variations of the basic MOSFET.
