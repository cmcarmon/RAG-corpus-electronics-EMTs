Historically, technology has been the limiting factor in hearing aids. Early on, carbon hearing aids provided a
limited gain and a narrow, peaky frequency response. Nowadays, hearing aids have a broader bandwidth and
a ﬂatter frequency response. Consequently, more people can beneﬁt from the improved technology. With the
advent of digital technology, the promise is that even more people would be able to do so. Unfortunately, as
will be pointed out below, we have not fulﬁlled this promise yet.
