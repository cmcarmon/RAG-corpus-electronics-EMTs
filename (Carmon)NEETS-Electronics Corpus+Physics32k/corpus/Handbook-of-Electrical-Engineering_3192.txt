Resonant Power Supplies
Similar to the PWM converters, there are two types of resonant converters: single-ended and double-ended.
Resonant  converter  conÔ¨Ågurations  are  obtained  from  the  PWM  converters  explained  earlier  by  adding  LC
(inductor-capacitor) resonating elements to obtain sinusoidally varying voltage and/or current waveforms. This
approach reduces the switching losses and the switch stresses during switching instants, enabling the converter to
operate at high switching frequencies, resulting in reduced size, weight, and cost. Some other advantages of resonant
converters are that leakage inductances of HF transformers and the junction capacitances of semiconductors can
