Networks of inductors and resistors (known as L–R 
circuits)  can  also  be  used  for  timing  and  pulse 
shaping.  In  comparison  with  capacitors,  however,

  Figure  3.37  shows  a  simple  L–R  network  in 
which  an  inductor  is  connected  to  a  constant 
voltage supply. When the supply is first connected, 
the current, i, will rise exponentially with time, as 
shown in Fig. 3.38. At the same time, the inductor 
voltage    VL, will  fall,  as  shown  in  Fig.  3.39). The 
rate  of  change  of  current  with  time  will  depend 
upon  the  ratio  of  inductance  to  resistance  and  is 
known as the time constant. Hence: 
 
Time constant, t = L/R 
 
where  L is  the  value  of  inductance  (H),  R is  the 
resistance (F), and t is the time constant (s).  
  The current flowing in the inductor, i, varies with 
time, t, according to the relationship:
