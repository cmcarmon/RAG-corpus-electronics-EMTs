In mathematics, the group of rotations about a fixed point in four-dimensional Euclidean space is denoted SO(4). The name comes from the fact that it is (isomorphic to) the special orthogonal group of order 4.
In this article rotation means rotational displacement. For the sake of uniqueness rotation angles are assumed to be in the segment [0, Ï€] except where mentioned or clearly implied by the context otherwise.
A "fixed plane" is a plane for which every vector in the plane is unchanged after the rotation. An "invariant plane" is a plane for which every vector in the plane, although it may be affected by the rotation, remains in the plane after the rotation.
