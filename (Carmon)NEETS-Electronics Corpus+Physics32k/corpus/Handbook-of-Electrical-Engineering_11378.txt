In general, magnetic resonance imaging has greater intrinsic ability to distinguish between soft tissues than
computerized  tomography.  It  also  has  some  ability  to  visualize  moving  blood.  As  the  preceding  discussion
indicates, magnetic resonance is a richer and more complex modality than CT. Typically MRI has been more
expensive than CT. Both MRI and CT have been used primarily for anatomic imaging, but MRI has the potential
through spectroscopy (visualization of other nuclei than hydrogen) to become a factor in physiologic imaging.
Thus,  it  can  be  anticipated  that  magnetic  resonance  imaging  will  continue  to  increase  and  become  an  even
more important modality in the next decade.
