For  either  wye-delta  or  delta-wye  connections,  phases  shall  be  labeled  in  such  a  way  that  positive  sequence
quantities  on  the  high  voltage  side  lead  their  corresponding  positive  sequence  quantities  on  the  low  voltage
side by 30o. The effect on negative sequence quantities may be the reverse, i.e., HV values lag LV values by 30o.
