Database Abstraction
A DBMS is expected to provide for 
 without any
need  for  the  knowledge  of  how  the  data  is  stored  in  actual  ﬁles.  This  implies  that  the  internal  ﬁle  structure
could be modiﬁed without any change to the user’s perception of the database. To achieve data independence,
the Standards Planning and Requirements Committee (SPARC) of the American National Standards Institute
(ANSI) in its 1977 report recommended three levels of database abstraction (see Fig. 94.1). The lowest level in
the abstraction is the internal level. Here, the database is viewed as a collection of ﬁles organized according to
one of several possible internal data organizations (e.g., B
-tree data organization). In the conceptual level, the

database is viewed at an abstract level. The user at this level is shielded from the internal storage details. At the

external level, each group of users has their own perception or
