Perhaps the best way to expand your knowledge of electronics is to develop 
your own ideas, design some circuits, build and test them, and then go back 
and tweak your design. Sometimes the only way to find out what the limita­
tions of various parts or designs are is to fry a few LEDs, toast a couple of 
ICs, or stay up all night probing the depths of a nonworking circuit until you 
figure out what’s wrong with it. To quote a popular science teacher, Valerie 
Frizzle, “Take chances, make mistakes, get messy!” (But, please, take safety 
precautions no matter what else you do!)
