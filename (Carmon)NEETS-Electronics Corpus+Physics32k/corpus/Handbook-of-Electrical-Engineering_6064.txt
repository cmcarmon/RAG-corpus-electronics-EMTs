The  programs  used  by  the  other  three  groups  have  usually  been  initially  created  in  the  universities.  They
start life as research programs and later are used for teaching and/or consultancy programs. Where the consultant
is also an academic, then the programs may well retain their crude research style IO. However, if they are to
be used by others who are not so familiar with the algorithms, then usually they are modiÔ¨Åed to make them
more  user  friendly.  Once  this  is  achieved,  the  programs  become  commercial  and  are  used  by  consultants,
industry,  and  utilities.  These  are  the  types  of  programs  that  are  now  so  commonly  seen  in  the  engineering
journals quite often bundled together in a generic package.
