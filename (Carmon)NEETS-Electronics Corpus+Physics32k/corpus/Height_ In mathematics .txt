In elementary models of space, height may indicate the third dimension, the other two being length and width. Height is normal to the plane formed by the length and width.
Height is also used as a name for some more abstract definitions. These include:
The altitude of a triangle, which is the length from a vertex of a triangle to the line formed by the opposite side;
A measurement in a circular segment of the distance from the midpoint of the arc of the circular segment to the midpoint of the line joining the endpoints of the arc (see diagram in circular segment);
In a rooted tree, the height of a vertex is the length of the longest downward path to a leaf from that vertex;
In algebraic number theory, a "height function" is a measurement related to the minimal polynomial of an algebraic number;
among other uses in commutative algebra and representation theory.
