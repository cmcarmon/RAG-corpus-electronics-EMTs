DO’s and DON’Ts of using an analogue multimeter 
 
DO ensure that you have selected the correct range 
and  measuring  function  before  attempting 
to 
connect the meter into a circuit. 
 
DO  select  a  higher  range  than  expected  and  then 
progressively  increase  the  sensitivity  as  necessary 
to obtain a meaningful indication. 
 
DO  remember  to  zero  on  the  ohms  range  before 
measuring resistance. 
 
DO switch the meter to the ‘off’ position (if one is 
available) before attempting to transport the meter.
