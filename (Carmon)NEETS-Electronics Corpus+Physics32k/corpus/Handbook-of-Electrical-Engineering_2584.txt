Analogous to these Ô¨Åeld-effect devices is the buried-channel, depletion-mode, or normally on MOSFET, which
contains a surface layer of the same doping type as the source and drain (opposite type to the semiconductor
body of the device). As a result, it has a built-in or normally on channel from source to drain with a conductance
that is reduced when the gate depletes the majority carriers.
