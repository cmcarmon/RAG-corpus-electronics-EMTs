Data Base 800 Service
SCPs have been deployed throughout the United States in support of the Data Base 800 Service mandated by
the  Federal  Communications  Commission.  This  service  provides  its  subscribers  with  number  portability  so
that a single 800 number can be used with different carriers. The Data Base 800 Service architecture is shown
in  Fig.  72.14.  With  this  architecture,  800-number  calls  are  routed  from  an  end  ofﬁce  to  a  service  switching
point  (SSP)  which  launches  queries  through  a  CCS7  signaling  network  to  the  SCP.  The  SCP  identiﬁes  the
appropriate carrier, as speciﬁed by the 800 Service subscriber, and then, if appropriate, translates the 800 number
to a plain old telephone (POTS) number. This information is subsequently returned to the SSP so that the call
can be routed through the network by handing the call off to the appropriate carrier. This technology allows
subscribers to select the carrier and the POTS number as a function of criteria such as time of day, day of week,
percent allocation, and the location of the calling station. Thus the SCP provides two customer-speciﬁed routing
information functions: a carrier identiﬁcation function and an address translation function.
