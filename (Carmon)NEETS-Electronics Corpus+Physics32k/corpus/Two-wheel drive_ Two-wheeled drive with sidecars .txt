For three-wheeled vehicles such as motorcycles with sidecars, the term is used to describe vehicles which can power the sidecar as well as the back wheel. Sidecar-drive vehicles are typically mechanically driven via a shaft and may or may not have a differential. This scheme greatly improves offroad performance, but is more complicated and requires more power to operate, thus most 2WD machines are vehicles created with special uses in mind such as trials or military use. The first use of sidecar drive appears in 1928 with the apparent independent invention of Baughan in the UK, and Mokharov in the USSR.
