While there are virtually countless variations in microprocessor circuit conﬁgurations, the
system architecture of a typical microprocessor is shown in Figure 6.3.2. The arithmetic logic
unit (ALU) accepts data from the data bus, processes the data as per program-storage instructions
and/or external control signals, and feeds the results into temporary storage, from which external
control and actuator control functions can be performed. The accumulators are parallel storage
registers used for processing the work in progress, temporarily storing addresses and data, and
housekeeping functions. The stacks provide temporary data storage in a sequential order and are
of use during the execution of subroutines. A subroutine is a group of instructions that appears
only once in the program code, but can be executed from different points in the program. The
program counter is a register/counter that holds the address of the memory location containing
the next instruction to be executed. The status register contains condition-code bits or ﬂags (set
to logic 1 or logic 0, depending on the result of the previous instruction) that are used to make
decisions and redirect the program ﬂow. The control unit (CU), which consists of the timing
and data-routing circuits, decodes the instruction being processed and properly establishes data
paths among the various elements of the microprocessor. Interconnections may take the form of
