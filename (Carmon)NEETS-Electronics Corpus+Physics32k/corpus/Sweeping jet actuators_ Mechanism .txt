The impetus behind the research into sweeping jet actuators lies in the realization that any vertical tail structure on an aircraft is a parasitic surface in level flight. The design specification that must be met by the vertical stabilizer of any multi-engined aircraft is that it be able to produce enough lift to counteract any thrust asymmetry that would come as a result of engine failure during rotation (takeoff); but in any condition that is not an emergency or where a yaw moment is not desired the vertical stabilizer will only contribute added weight and drag to the aircraft.
The jet nozzles (located directly upstream of the hinge around which the rudder moves) eject a subsonic stream of air that flows over the rudder and act to retain or reattach the boundary layer to the control surface as it is deflected beyond the incidence angle where natural flow would separate, generating as much as a 30-percent increase in the effective lift produced by the rudder.
