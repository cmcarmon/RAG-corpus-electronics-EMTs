N = (I - E) / M X 1,000
N = Net Migration Rate
I = Number of Immigrants Entering the Area
E = Number of Emigrants Leaving the Area
M = Mid Year Population
At the start of the year, country A had a population of 1,000,000. Throughout the year there was a total of 200,000 people that immigrated to (entered) country A, and 100,000 people that emigrated from (left) country A. Throughout the year there was a total of 100,000 births and 100,000 deaths. What is the net migration rate?
First, find the mid year population for country A.
M = [ Population at Start of Year + Population at End of Year ] / 2
M = [ 1,000,000 + (1,000,000 + 200,000 - 100,000) ] / 2
M = [ 1,000,000 + 1,100,000 ] / 2
M = 2,100,000 / 2
M = 1,050,000
The mid year population for country A is 1,050,000.
Second,find the net migration for country A and please keep in mind this is simply the number of immigrants minus the number of emigrants, not the actual rate.
I - E = 200,000 - 100,000
I - E = 100,000
The net migration for country A is 100,000.
Third, plug your findings into the formula to find the net migration rate for country A.
N = (I - E) / M X 1,000
N = 100,000 / 1,050,000 X 1,000
N = 95.23809523809524
N = 95.2
The net migration rate for country A is 95.2 per 1,000 people. This means that for every 1,000 people in country A at the beginning of the year, 95.2 will have immigrated to country A by the end of the year. This number numerically shows the impact of migration on the country's population and allows for the comparison of country A's net migration rate to other country's net migration rate.
