rate,  the  replications  would  overlap  and  the  information  about  X(v)  [and  thus  x(t)]  is  irretrievably  lost.
Undersampling results in aliased data. The minimum sampling rate at which aliasing does not occur is referred
to as the Nyquist rate which, in our example, is 2B. Eq. (73.66) was dubbed the cardinal series by the junior
Whittaker [1929].
