Shunt reactors are used in power systems to counteract the effect of the line parasitic capacitance, thereby stabilizing the system voltage within acceptable limits. For short lines, we can basically ignore the impact of capacitive current from a voltage regulation point of view, but medium and long lines can have voltages at their receiving end much higher than the sending end, thus creating issues such as over-fluxing of power transformers and over stressing of line insulators. Under light-load conditions, the line produces more VARs, resulting in receiving end voltage being higher than sending end voltage. In order to consume the excess VARs when system is lightly loaded, an inductor is added to the system. Since inductors absorbs VARs, a reactor is connected in parallel with shunt capacitance of the line known as Shunt Reactor,
