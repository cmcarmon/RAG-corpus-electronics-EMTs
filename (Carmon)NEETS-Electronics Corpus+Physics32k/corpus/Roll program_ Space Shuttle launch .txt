During the launch of a space shuttle, the roll program was simultaneously accompanied by a pitch maneuver and yaw maneuver.
The roll program occurred during a shuttle launch for the following reasons:
To place the shuttle in a heads down position
Increasing the mass that can be carried into orbit
Increasing the orbital altitude
Simplifying the trajectory of a possible Return to Launch site abort maneuver
Improving radio line-of-sight propagation
Orienting the shuttle more parallel toward the ground with the nose to the east
