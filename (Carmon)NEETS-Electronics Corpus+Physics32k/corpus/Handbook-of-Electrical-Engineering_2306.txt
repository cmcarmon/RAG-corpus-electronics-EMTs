where n = 3 to 6. As VR = BV, M ﬁ ¥ and IRA ﬁ ¥. The above BV is valid for a strictly plane junction without
any  curvature.  However,  in  a  real  planar  diode  as  shown  in  Fig. 22.9,  the p-diffusion  has  a  curvature  with  a
ﬁnite radius xj. If the diode is doped unsymmetrically, thus sp >> sn, then the depletion area penetrates mostly
into the n region. Because of the ﬁnite radius, the breakdown occurs at the radius xj, rather than in a plane
junction [Grove, 1967]. The breakdown voltage is signiﬁcantly reduced due to the curvature. In very shallow
planar diodes, the avalanche breakdown voltage BV can be much smaller than 10 V.
