Capacitance measurements are usually taken with a capacitance meter. Capacitance tolerances vary
even more widely than resistance tolerances. Capacitance tolerances depend on the type of capacitor, the
value of capacitance, and the voltage rating. The actual measurement of capacitance is very simple;
however, you must make the important decision of whether to reject or to continue to use the capacitor
after it has been tested.
