but there is an important difference. In the new topology, the resistor RL we
are trying to drive is now part of the voltage divider feedback network. Thus
in Figure 15.15a we are using the resistor Rs to sample the current through
RL, whereas in Figure 15.15b R1 and R2 sample the voltage across RL. The
distinction seems trivial until we think in terms of RL varying in value, or even
being nonlinear. Then it is clear that there is a fundamental difference in the
two topologies.
