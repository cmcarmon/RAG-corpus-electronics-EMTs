According to Kepler's first law of planetary motion, all planets, comets, and asteroids in the Solar System have approximately elliptical orbits around the Sun. It is only approximate because of perturbations due to the gravity of other bodies. Every ellipse has two focus points, and the Sun is at one of these focus points for the elliptical orbits of its satellites. Hence, an orbiting body has a closest and a farthest point from its parent object, that is, a perihelion and an aphelion. Each extreme is known as an apsis.
Orbital eccentricity measures the flatness (departure from a perfect circle) of the orbit.earth alwalys moves around the sun.
