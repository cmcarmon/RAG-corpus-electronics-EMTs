Differential Chaos Shift Keying (DCSK)
In Differential Chaos Shift Keying (DCSK), every symbol to be transmitted is represented by two chaotic sample
functions. The ﬁrst sample function serves as a reference, while the second one carries the information. symbol
“1” is sent by transmitting a reference signal provided by a chaos generator twice in succession; while for symbol
“0,” the reference chaotic signal is transmitted, followed by an inverted copy of the same integral. Thus,
