This chapter has presented two methods for the design of state
estimators; however, the task is not complete. For example, the
Kalman ﬁlter methodology would require the designer to
develop and use a full stochastic model of the system, process
noise, actuators, and sensors. Because the Kalman ﬁlter ap-
proach assumes a linear model driven by white noise, any
colored noise process will necessitate the augmentation of
additional states to the model so that the colored noise process
is represented as a linear system with white noise inputs.
