Conclusions and Future Directions
DSP processors have been used extensively in a number of applications, even in non-DSP applications such as
graphics. The fourth-generation ﬂoating-point TMS320C40, code compatible with the TMS320C30, features
an  instruction  cycle  time  of  40  ns  and  six  serial  ports.  The  ﬁfth-generation  ﬁxed-point  TMS320C50,  code
compatible with the ﬁrst two generations of ﬁxed-point processors, features an instruction cycle time of 35 ns
and 10 K words (16-bit) of on-chip data and program memory. Currently, both the ﬁxed-point and ﬂoating-
point processors are being supported by TI.
