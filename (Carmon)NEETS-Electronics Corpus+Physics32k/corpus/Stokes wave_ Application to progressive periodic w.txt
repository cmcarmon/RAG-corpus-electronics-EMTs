The waves of permanent form propagate with a constant phase velocity (or celerity), denoted as c. If the steady wave motion is in the horizontal x-direction, the flow quantities η and u are not separately dependent on x and time t, but are functions of x − ct:

.


{\displaystyle \eta (x,t)=\eta (x-ct)\quad {\text{and}}\quad \mathbf {u} (x,z,t)=\mathbf {u} (x-ct,z).}

Further the waves are periodic – and because they are also of permanent form – both in horizontal space x and in time t, with wavelength λ and period τ respectively. Note that Φ(x,z,t) itself is not necessary periodic due to the possibility of a constant (linear) drift in x and/or t:

φ

)
,


{\displaystyle \Phi (x,z,t)=\beta x-\gamma t+\varphi (x-ct,z),}

with φ(x,z,t) – as well as the derivatives ∂Φ/∂t and ∂Φ/∂x – being periodic. Here β is the mean flow velocity below trough level, and γ is related to the hydraulic head as observed in a frame of reference moving with the wave's phase velocity c (so the flow becomes steady in this reference frame).
In order to apply the Stokes expansion to progressive periodic waves, it is advantageous to describe them through Fourier series as a function of the wave phase θ(x,t):




θ

k
x
−
ω
t
=
k

(

x
−
c
t

)

,


{\displaystyle \theta =kx-\omega t=k\left(x-ct\right),}

assuming waves propagating in the x–direction. Here k = 2π / λ is the wavenumber, ω = 2π / τ is the angular frequency and c = ω / k (= λ / τ) is the phase velocity.
Now, the free surface elevation η(x,t) of a periodic wave can be described as the Fourier series:

{\displaystyle \eta =\sum _{n=1}^{\infty }A_{n}\,\cos \,(n\theta ).}

Similarly, the corresponding expression for the velocity potential Φ(x,z,t) is:

satisfying both the Laplace equation ∇2Φ = 0 in the fluid interior, as well as the boundary condition ∂Φ/∂z = 0 at the bed z = −h.
For a given value of the wavenumber k, the parameters: An, Bn (with n = 1, 2, 3, ...), c, β and γ have yet to be determined. They all can be expanded as perturbation series in ε. Fenton (1990) provides these values for fifth-order Stokes' wave theory.
For progressive periodic waves, derivatives with respect to x and t of functions f(θ,z) of θ(x,t) can be expressed as derivatives with respect to θ:

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}=+k\,{\frac {\partial f}{\partial \theta }}\qquad {\text{and}}\qquad {\frac {\partial f}{\partial t}}=-\omega \,{\frac {\partial f}{\partial \theta }}.}

The important point for non-linear waves – in contrast to linear Airy wave theory – is that the phase velocity c also depends on the wave amplitude a, besides its dependence on wavelength λ = 2π / k and mean depth h. Negligence of the dependence of c on wave amplitude results in the appearance of secular terms, in the higher-order contributions to the perturbation-series solution. Stokes (1847) already applied the required non-linear correction to the phase speed c in order to prevent secular behaviour. A general approach to do so is now known as the Lindstedt–Poincaré method. Since the wavenumber k is given and thus fixed, the non-linear behaviour of the phase velocity c = ω / k is brought into account by also expanding the angular frequency ω into a perturbation series:




ω

⋯
.


{\displaystyle \omega =\omega _{0}+\varepsilon \,\omega _{1}+\varepsilon ^{2}\,\omega _{2}+\cdots .}

Here ω0 will turn out to be related to the wavenumber k through the linear dispersion relation. However time derivatives, through ∂f/∂t = −ω ∂f/∂θ, now also give contributions – containing ω1, ω2, etc. – to the governing equations at higher orders in the perturbation series. By tuning ω1, ω2, etc., secular behaviour can be prevented. For surface gravity waves, it is found that ω1 = 0 and the first non-zero contribution to the dispersion relation comes from ω2 (see e.g. the sub-section "Third-order dispersion relation" above).
