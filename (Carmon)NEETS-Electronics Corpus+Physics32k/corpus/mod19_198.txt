General purpose connectors were formerly designated with the prefix "AN." You may find older 
connectors with this prefix. The superseding connector has the same part number except the "AN" has 
been replaced by "MS." Table 1-13 shows the method used to break down a connector for identification. 
This breakdown is for MIL-C-5015 connectors. Identification breakdown for other MIL-C connectors can 
be found in Naval Shore Electronics Criteria, Installation Standards and Practices, NAVELEX 0280-
LP-900-8000.
