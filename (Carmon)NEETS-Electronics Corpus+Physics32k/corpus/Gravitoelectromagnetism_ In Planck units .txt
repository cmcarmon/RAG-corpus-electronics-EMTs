From comparison of GEM equations and Maxwell's equations it is obvious that −1/(4πG) is the gravitational analog of vacuum permittivity ε0. Adopting Planck units normalizes G, c and 1/(4πε0) to 1, thereby eliminating these constants from both sets of equations. The two sets of equations then become identical but for the minus sign preceding 4π in the GEM equations and a factor of four in Ampere's law. These minus signs stem from an essential difference between gravity and electromagnetism: electrostatic charges of the same sign repel each other, whereas masses attract each other. Hence the GEM equations are nearly Maxwell's equations, but with mass (or mass density) substituting for charge (or charge density), and −1/(4πG) replacing the vacuum permittivity ε0. The factor 4π appears in both the GEM and Maxwell equations, because Planck units normalize G and 1/(4πε0) to 1, and not 4πG and ε0.
