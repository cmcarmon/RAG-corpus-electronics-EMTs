The ”symbol” given for each quantity is the standard alphabetical letter used to represent
that quantity in an algebraic equation. Standardized letters like these are common in the
disciplines of physics and engineering, and are internationally recognized. The ”unit abbrevi-
ation” for each quantity represents the alphabetical symbol used as a shorthand notation for
its particular unit of measurement. And, yes, that strange-looking ”horseshoe” symbol is the
capital Greek letter Ω, just a character in a foreign alphabet (apologies to any Greek readers
here).
