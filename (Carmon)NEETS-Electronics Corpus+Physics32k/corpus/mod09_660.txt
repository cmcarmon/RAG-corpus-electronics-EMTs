The STEP-BY-STEP (STEP) COUNTER is used as a voltage multiplier when a stepped voltage 
must be provided to any device which requires such an input. The step counter provides an output which 
increases in one-step increments for each cycle of the input. At some predetermined level, the output 
voltage reaches a point which causes a circuit, such as a blocking oscillator, to be triggered.
