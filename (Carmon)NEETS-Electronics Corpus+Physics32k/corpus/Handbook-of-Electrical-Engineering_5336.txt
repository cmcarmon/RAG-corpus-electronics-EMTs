The  other  determinant  of  current  is  the  spectrum  of  the  light.  The  two  most  commonly  used  spectra  in
modeling are AM1.5 for terrestrial applications and AM0 for space applications. AM1.5 is the spectrum of the
sunlight after it has passed through an equivalent thickness of 1.5 atmospheres. The integrated power of this
spectrum is 970 W m–2. AM0 is the spectrum of the sunlight before it passes through any of the atmosphere
(0 atmospheres) and has an integrated power of 1353 W m–2. AM1.5D is used to describe direct sunlight for
applications that use optics to focus the sunlight onto the solar cell, these solar cells are called concentrators
and the available power to the optical surface is 752 W m–2.
