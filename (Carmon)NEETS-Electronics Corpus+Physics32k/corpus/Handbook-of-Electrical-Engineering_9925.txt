2. Reducing  the  steady-state  errors.  Steady-state  errors  are  decreased  by  increasing  the  open-loop  gain
Gc(jw)Gp(jw)H(jw) in the frequency range of the errors. Low-frequency errors are reduced by increasing
the  low-frequency  open-loop  gain  and  by  increasing  the  type  number  of  the  system  [the  number  of
poles at the origin in the open-loop function Gc(s)Gp(s)H(s)].
