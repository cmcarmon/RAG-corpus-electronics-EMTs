During turn-off, the current is held constant while the
collector voltage rises. This is followed by a sharp decline in
collector current as the MOS channel turns off. The turn-off
transient until this phase is similar to a MOSFET. However, the
IGBT has excess charge in the drift region during on-state
conduction that must be removed to turn the device off. This
high concentration of minority carriers stored in the n-drift
region supports current ï¬‚ow even after the MOS channel is cut
off. As the minority carrier density decays due to recombin-
ation, it leads to a gradual reduction in the collector current
and results in a current tail. For an on-state current of ION , the
magnitude of the current tail and turn-off time are roughly
expressed as:
