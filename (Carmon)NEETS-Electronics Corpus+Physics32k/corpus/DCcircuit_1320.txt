The major caveat here is that the reluctance of a material to magnetic ﬂux actually changes
with the concentration of ﬂux going through it. This makes the ”Ohm’s Law” for magnetic
circuits nonlinear and far more difﬁcult to work with than the electrical version of Ohm’s Law.
It would be analogous to having a resistor that changed resistance as the current through it
varied (a circuit composed of varistors instead of resistors).
