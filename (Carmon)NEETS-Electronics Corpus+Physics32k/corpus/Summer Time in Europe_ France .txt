From 1923 until the Second World War France observed summer time from the last Saturday in March until the first Saturday in October. During the Second World War France also observed summer time. However, after the war the practice was abandoned (since the country changed time zones instituting de facto permanent summer time). In 1975, summer time was reimplemented because of the oil crisis.
Since GMT (now UTC) is France's "natural" time zone its use of UTC+1 in winter can be seen as a form of daylight saving time in winter, while its use of Central European Summer Time (UTC+2) in summer can be seen as a form of "double summer time".
France follows EU rules regarding the start and end times and dates for summer time.
