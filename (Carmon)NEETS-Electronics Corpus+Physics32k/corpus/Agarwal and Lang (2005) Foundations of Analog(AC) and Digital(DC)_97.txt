relation between the terminal current and voltage of that element, for example,
V = IR. More examples of such relations, or element laws, will be presented in
Section 1.6.2. Further, when the restriction of non-interaction is satisfied, the
focus of circuit operation becomes the terminal currents and voltages, and not
the electromagnetic fields within the elements. Thus, these currents and voltages
become the fundamental signals within the circuit. Such signals are discussed
further in Section 1.8.
