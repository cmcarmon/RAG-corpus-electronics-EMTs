Whenever the rate of change fâ€² of a quantity f is proportional to the displacement of an object, the quantity f is a linear function of the object's absement. For example, when the fuel flow rate is proportional to the position of the throttle lever, then the total amount of fuel consumed is proportional to the lever's absement.
Flow-based musical instruments, such as the hydraulophone, exhibit this phenomenon inherently: whereas a piano produces note strength in proportion to the velocity at which the keys are struck, and the organ (a true tracker organ) produces note strength in proportion to how far down a key is pressed (displacement), the hydraulophone produces note strength in proportion to the time-integral of the distance down the water "key" is pressed. Thus pressing on the key (water jet) for a longer period of time will result in a buildup in sound level, as water accumulates in the sounding mechanism (reservoir), up to a certain maximum filling point beyond which the sound level reaches a maximum, or falls off (along with a slow decay when a water jet is unblocked).
As the displacement can be seen as a mechanical analogue of electric charge, the absement can be seen as a mechanical analogue of the time-integrated charge, a quantity useful for modelling some types of memory elements.
