In a manner similar to our invention of the ideal voltage source, we pos-
tulate an ideal conductor to be one in which any amount of current can flow
without loss of voltage or power. The symbol for an ideal conductor is shown
in Figure 1.27a. Notice that the symbol is just a line. The ideal conductor is no
different from the ideal wire we saw earlier. Ideal conductors can be used to
represent a channel for fluid flow in hydrodynamic systems.
