Recall that the inductance of a line delays the charging of the line capacitance. The velocity of
propagation is therefore related to the values of L and C. If the inductance and capacitance of the rf line
are known, the time required for any waveform to travel the length of the line can be determined. To see
how this works, observe the following relationship:
