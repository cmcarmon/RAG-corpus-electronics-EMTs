A diatomic molecular orbital diagram is used to understand the bonding of a diatomic molecule. MO diagrams can be used to deduce magnetic properties of a molecule and how they change with ionization. They also give insight to the bond order of the molecule, how many bonds are shared between the two atoms.
Molecular orbital theory is a model that demonstrates how electron interaction leads to bond formation. The motivation for this model comes from the electrons not being bound to a single bond, but instead influenced by the relative position of its nucleus within the molecule. The energies of the electrons are further understood by applying the Schr√∂dinger equation to a molecule. Quantum Mechanics is able to describe the energies exactly for single electron systems but can be approximated precisely for multiple electron systems using the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation, such that the nuclei are assumed stationary. The LCAO-MO method is used in conjunction to further describe the state of the molecule.
Diatomic molecules consist of a bond between only two atoms. They can be broken into two categories: homonuclear and heteronuclear. A homonuclear diatomic molecule is one composed of two atoms of the same element. Examples are H2, O2, and N2. A heteronuclear diatomic molecule is composed of two atoms of two different elements. Examples include CO, HCl, and NO.
