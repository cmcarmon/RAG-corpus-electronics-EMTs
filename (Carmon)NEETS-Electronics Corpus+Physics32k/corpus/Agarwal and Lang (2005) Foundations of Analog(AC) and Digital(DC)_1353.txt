How must C1P, C2P, and C3P be related to C1T, C2T, and C3T for both networks to
have the same terminal relations?

Figure 9.70 shows two inductive two-port networks. One is a
‘‘’’ network, and one is a ‘‘T’’ network. For the  network, find v1P and v2P as
functions of i1P and i2P. For the T network, find v1T and v2T as functions of i1T and i2T.
