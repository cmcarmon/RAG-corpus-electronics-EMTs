The origin of spatial dispersion is nonlocal response, where response to a force field appears at many locations, and can appear even in locations where the force is zero. This usually arises due to a spreading of effects by the hidden microscopic degrees of freedom.
As an example, consider the current



J
(
x
,
t
)


{\displaystyle J(x,t)}
that is driven in response to an electric field



E
(
x
,
t
)


{\displaystyle E(x,t)}
, which is varying in space (x) and time (t). Simplified laws such as Ohm's law would say that these are directly proportional to each other,



J
=
σ
E


{\displaystyle J=\sigma E}
, but this breaks down if the system has memory (temporal dispersion) or spreading (spatial dispersion). The most general linear response is given by:

t

{\displaystyle J(x,t)=\int _{-\infty }^{-\infty }dx'\int _{-\infty }^{-\infty }dt'\,\sigma (x,x',t,t')E(x',t'),}

{\displaystyle \sigma (x,x',t,t')dx'\,dt'}
is the nonlocal conductivity function.
If the system is invariant in time (time translation symmetry) and invariant in space (space translation symmetry), then we can simplify because

{\displaystyle \sigma (x,x',t,t')=\sigma _{\rm {sym}}(x-x',t-t')}
for some convolution kernel

{\displaystyle \sigma _{\rm {sym}}}
. We can also consider plane wave solutions for

{\displaystyle E}
and

like so:

{\displaystyle E(x,t)=\operatorname {Re} (E_{0}e^{ikx-i\omega t})}

which yields a remarkably simple relationship between the two plane waves' complex amplitudes:
