Several sports governing bodies regulate the bounciness of a ball through various ways, some direct, some indirect.
AFL: Regulates the gauge pressure of the football to be between 62 kPa and 76 kPa.
FIBA: Regulates the gauge pressure so the basketball bounces between 1200 mm and 1400 mm (top of the ball) when it is dropped from a height of 1800 mm (bottom of the ball). This roughly corresponds to a COR of 0.727 to 0.806.
FIFA: Regulates the gauge pressure of the soccer ball to be between of 0.6 atm and 1.1 atm at sea level (61 to 111 kPa).
FIVB: Regulates the gauge pressure of the volleyball to be between 0.30 kgF/cm2 to 0.325 kgF/cm2 (29.4 to 31.9 kPa) for indoor volleyball, and 0.175 kgF/cm2 to 0.225 kgF/cm2 (17.2 to 22.1 kPa) for beach volleyball.
ITF: Regulates the height of the tennis ball bounce when dropped on a "a smooth, rigid and horizontal block of high mass". Different types of ball are allowed for different types of surfaces. When dropped from a height of 100 in (254 cm), the bounce must be 54–60 in (138–151 cm) for Type 1 balls, 53–58 in (135–147 cm) for Type 2 and Type 3 balls, and 48–53 in (122–135 cm) for High Altitude balls. This roughly corresponds to a COR of 0.735–0.775 (Type 1 ball), 0.728–0.762 (Type 2 & 3 balls), and 0.693–0.728 (High Altitude balls) when dropped on the testing surface.
ITTF: Regulates the playing surface so that the table tennis ball bounces approximately 23 cm when dropped from a height of 30 cm. This roughly corresponds to a COR of about 0.876 against the playing surface.
NBA: Regulates the gauge pressure of the basketball to be between 7.5 and 8.5 psi (51.7 to 58.6 kPa).
NFL: Regulates the gauge pressure of the American football to be between 12.5 and 13.5 psi (86 to 93 kPa).
R&A/USGA: Limits the COR of the golf ball directly, which should not exceed 0.83 against a golf club.
The pressure of an American football was at the center of the deflategate controversy. Some sports do not regulate the bouncing properties of balls directly, but instead specify a construction method. In baseball, the introduction of a cork-based ball helped to end the dead-ball era and trigger the live-ball era.
