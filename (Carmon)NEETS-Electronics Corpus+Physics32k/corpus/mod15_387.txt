The outputs of the accelerometers discussed so far are voltages, which are proportional to 
acceleration. These voltages are assigned scale factors (such as units per volt). The voltage represents the 
quantity. In many applications there is need for accelerometer output signals to be in digital form, which 
means that the signal consists of a series of pulses that indicates an actual number. Pulse counting 
accelerometers satisfy this need. Their pulse output can be supplied directly to computer circuits and other 
digital logic equipment. A schematic and a pictorial diagram of a pulse counting accelerometer is shown 
in figure 3-22, view (A) and view (B).
