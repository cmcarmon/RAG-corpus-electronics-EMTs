A depletion MOSFET may also be constructed as 
a P-channel device. P-channel devices operate in the 
same manner as N-channel devices. The difference 
is that the majority carriers are holes. The drain lead 
is made negative with respect to the source, and the 
drain current flows in the opposite direction. The gate 
may be positive or negative with respect to the source.
The schematic symbol for a P-channel	depletion		
MOSFET is shown in Figure 32-11. The only  difference 
between the N-channel and P-channel symbols is the 
direction of the arrow on the substrate lead.
