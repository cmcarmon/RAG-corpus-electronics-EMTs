Most residences and small buildings are supplied with power by means of single-phase,
three-wire service, as illustrated in Figure 10.3.3. A distribution transformer is located on a power
pole or underground, near the residential customer. Inside residences, the 220-V supply, being
available between the two “hot” wires, is used for major appliances such as dryers, ranges, and
ovens. The 110-V loads up to 20 to 40 A are connected between the ground wire and either “hot”
wire, while nearly balancing the loads on the two “hot” wires. Each of these circuits, protected by
its own fuse or circuit breaker, supplies lighting loads and/or convenience outlets. In the wiring
of residential and commercial buildings, safety considerations are of paramount importance, the
principal hazards being ﬁre and electric shock. Residential wiring is also discussed in Section 4.4.
