theory assumptions are both violated for the case when a loadﬂow does solve after discontinuous parameter
change because the parameter variation is not continuous and smooth and the power system model may not
be continuously differentiable at the point (x0, p0). The P-V curve, or Q-V curve, or eigenvalues and eigenvectors
could be computed and used to assess proximity to voltage instability after each equipment outage or discon-
tinuous parameter change when a loadﬂow solution exists to establish whether the solutions is stable or unstable
at values of p above p0. The computation of the P-V curve, Q-V curve, or eigenvalues and eigenvectors requires
signiﬁcant computation and is not practical for screening thousands of contingencies for voltage instability or
for assessing proximity to instability although they are used to assess stability and proximity to instability after
a few selected contingencies. These methods also do not explicitly take into account the many discontinuities
in the model and eigenvalues that occur for continuous parameter and discontinuous parameter changes. In
many cases, the eigenvalue changes due to discontinuities is virtually all the change that occurs in an eigenvalue
that approaches instability [IEEE, 1993] and the above methods have particular difﬁculty in such cases. The
above methods cannot assess the agents that lose voltage instability for a particular event and cannot diagnose
a cure when the loadﬂow has no solution for an equipment outage, wheeling or transaction combination, or
both.  These  methods  can  provide  a  cure  when  a  loadﬂow  solution  exists  but  its  capabilities  have  not  been
compared  to  the  f  Security  Assessment  and  Diagnosis  proposed  cure.  The  Voltage  Stability
Security Assessment and Diagnosis (VSSAD) [Schlueter, 1998d] overcomes the above difﬁculties because:
