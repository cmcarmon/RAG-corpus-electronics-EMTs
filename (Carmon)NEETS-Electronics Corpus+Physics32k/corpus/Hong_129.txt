The circuit for a simple peak detector, shown in Figure 6.6 in section 6.2.1, uses a 
diode, capacitor, and resistor. This circuit has a problem that the output signal is always 
one diode drop, 0.7V, below the input signal. Using an op amp and feedback it is possible 
to  make  a  precise  version  of  this  peak  detector  that  automatically  compensates  for  the 
voltage drop of the diode. The circuit for this peak detector is shown in Figure 10.4 with a 
diode  connected  to  a  resistor  and  capacitor,  as  before.  The  difference  is  that  now  the 
circuit input goes to the input of an op amp and the output signal from the diode is fed 
back into the inverting input of the op amp.
