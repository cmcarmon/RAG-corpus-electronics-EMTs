the motor. The rotor winding is usually short-circuited through external resistances that can be
varied. A squirrel-cage rotor has a winding consisting of conducting bars of copper or aluminum
embedded in slots cut in the rotor iron and short-circuited at each end by conducting end rings.
The squirrel-cage induction machine is the electromagnetic machine most widely used as a motor
because of its extreme simplicity and ruggedness. Although the induction machine in the motor
mode is the most common of all motors, the induction machine has very rarely been used as
a generator because its performance characteristics as a generator are not satisfactory for most
applications; however, it has recently been used as a wind-power generator. The induction machine
with a wound rotor is also used as a frequency changer.
