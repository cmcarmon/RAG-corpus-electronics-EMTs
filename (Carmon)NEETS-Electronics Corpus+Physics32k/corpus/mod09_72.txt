The ideal series-resonant circuit contains no resistance; it consists of only inductance and 
capacitance in series with each other and with the source voltage. In this respect, it has the same 
characteristics of the series circuits you have studied previously. Remember that current is the same in all 
parts of a series circuit because there is only one path for current.
