The purpose of this module is to acquaint you, the trainee, with the basic principles, techniques, and 
procedures associated with digital computers. We will use a desktop (personal) computer for most of the 
examples. Personal computers should be more familiar to you than the large mainframes, and the 
operating principles of personal computers relate directly to the operating principles of mainframe 
computers. You will learn the basic terminology used in the digital-computer world. When you have 
completed these chapters satisfactorily, you will have a better understanding of how computers are able to 
perform the demanding tasks assigned to them.
