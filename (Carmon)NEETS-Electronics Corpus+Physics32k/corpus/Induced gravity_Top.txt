Induced gravity (or emergent gravity) is an idea in quantum gravity that space-time curvature and its dynamics emerge as a mean field approximation of underlying microscopic degrees of freedom, similar to the fluid mechanics approximation of Boseâ€“Einstein condensates. The concept was originally proposed by Andrei Sakharov in 1967.
