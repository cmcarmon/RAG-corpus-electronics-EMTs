A vibrator is a mechanical device to generate vibrations. The vibration is often generated by an electric motor with an unbalanced mass on its driveshaft.
There are many different types of vibrator. Typically, they are components of larger products such as cellphones, pagers, vibrating sex toys, or video game controllers with a "rumble" feature.
