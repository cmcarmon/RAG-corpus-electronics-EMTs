Speed and Torque Control of Polyphase Induction Motors
The induction motor is valuable in so many applications because it combines simplicity and
ruggedness. Although a good number of industrial drives run at substantially constant speed,
quite a few applications need variable speed. Speed-control capability is essential in such
applications as conveyors, hoists, and elevators. Because the induction motor is essentially a
constant-speed machine, designers have sought creative ways to easily and efÔ¨Åciently vary its
speed continuously over a wide range of operating conditions. We only indicate the methods of
speed control here.
