Here, the term B00 is constant while the coefﬁcients Bij and Bi0
summarize the quadratic and linear dependence of line losses
PL on the generations. Equation 8.5 is called the B matrix loss
formula, and the B coefﬁcients in equation 8.5 are called the
loss factors. There exists a rich history in the literature on the
computation of loss factors for a given economic dispatch
problem.
