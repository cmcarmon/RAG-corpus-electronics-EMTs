Draw the conjugate beam for the real beam. This beam has the same length as the real beam and has corresponding supports as listed above.
In general, if the real support allows a slope, the conjugate support must develop shear; and if the real support allows a displacement, the conjugate support must develop a moment.
The conjugate beam is loaded with the real beam's M/EI diagram. This loading is assumed to be distributed over the conjugate beam and is directed upward when M/EI is positive and downward when M/EI is negative. In other words, the loading always acts away from the beam.
