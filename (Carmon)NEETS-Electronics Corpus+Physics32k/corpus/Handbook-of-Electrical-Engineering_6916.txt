Autocorrelation: A function associated with a random signal X(t) that is deﬁned on pairs of time instants t1
and t2 and whose value is the expected value of the product of the random variables X(t1) and X(t2), i.e.,
RXX(t1,t2) = E[X(t1)X(t2)]. For weakly stationary random signals, it depends only on the offset t = t2 – t1,
so we write RXX(t) = E[X(t)X(t + t)].
