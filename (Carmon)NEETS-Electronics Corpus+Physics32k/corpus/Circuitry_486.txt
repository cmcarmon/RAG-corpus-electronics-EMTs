Figure  10.24  shows  the  arrangement  of  a  four- 
stage  shift  register  based    on  J-K  bistables.  The 
timing  diagram  for  this  circuit  is  shown  in  Fig. 
10.25. Note that each stage successively feeds data 
to the next stage. Note that all data transfer occurs 
on the falling edge of the clock pulse.
