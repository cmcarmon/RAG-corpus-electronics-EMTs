One of the uses of this equation is to determine if a phase transition will occur in a given situation. Consider the question of how much pressure is needed to melt ice at a temperature




Δ
T



{\displaystyle {\Delta T}}
below 0 °C. Note that water is unusual in that its change in volume upon melting is negative. We can assume





Δ
P

=


L

T

Δ
v




Δ
T



{\displaystyle {\Delta P}={\frac {L}{T\,\Delta v}}{\Delta T}}

and substituting in




L


{\displaystyle L}
= 3.34×105 J/kg (latent heat of fusion for water),




T


{\displaystyle T}
= 273 K (absolute temperature), and




Δ
v


{\displaystyle \Delta v}
= −9.05×10−5 m³/kg (change in specific volume from solid to liquid),
we obtain

P


Δ
T





{\displaystyle {\frac {\Delta P}{\Delta T}}}
= −13.5 MPa/K.
To provide a rough example of how much pressure this is, to melt ice at −7 °C (the temperature many ice skating rinks are set at) would require balancing a small car (mass = 1000 kg) on a thimble (area = 1 cm²).
