Spaceborne communications increase the effectiveness of military operations. The Department of Defense 
is engaged in the development of new communications techniques and systems, including some that are 
space based. As the use of space continues its march forward, vital new opportunities for national defense 
will continue to materialize. This will improve the survivability of our strategic communications against 
nuclear and electronic attack.
