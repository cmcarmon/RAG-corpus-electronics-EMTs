To derive the necessary formulas, we will denote the scaled
values by the subscript s and leave the values to be used for
realization without subscript. Impedance scaling means that
the impedance of every network element must be scaled by the
same constant, k. This immediately leads to Rs Â¼ R=k. For
frequency normalization, we introduce the formula:
