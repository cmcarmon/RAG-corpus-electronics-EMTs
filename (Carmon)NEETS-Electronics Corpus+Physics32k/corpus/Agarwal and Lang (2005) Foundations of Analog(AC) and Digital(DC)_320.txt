consider a more general voltage divider having N resistors, as shown in Figure 2.33.
It can be analyzed in the same manner as the two-resistor voltage divider. The only
difference is that there are now more unknowns to find, and hence more equations to
work with. To begin, suppose we assign the branch variables as shown in Figure 2.33.
