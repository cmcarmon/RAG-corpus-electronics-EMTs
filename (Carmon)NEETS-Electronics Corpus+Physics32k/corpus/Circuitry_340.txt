Now  letâ€™s  consider  what  will  happen  if  no  bias  at 
all  is  applied  to  the  amplifier  (see  Fig.  7.6).  The 
output signal will only comprise a series of positive 
half-cycles  and  the  active  device(s)  will  only  be 
conducting during half-cycles of the waveform (i.e. 
they will only be operating 50% of the time). 
  This mode of operation is known as Class B and 
is  commonly  used  in  high-efficiency  push-pull 
power  amplifiers  where  the  two  active  devices  in 
the output stage operate on alternate half-cycles of 
the waveform.
