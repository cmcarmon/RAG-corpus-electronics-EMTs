Input/Output Ports
The working registers provided in microprocessors may be thought of as high-speed extensions to the memories
used for storing programs and data. The random access memories (RAM) themselves are also arrays of registers,
though the form of circuit used differs considerably from the more conventional register. The need to transfer
data in and out of the system has led manufacturers to produce special registers which are further extensions
to the internal memory and are known as input and output ports. One of the simplest of input/output ports
is the Intel 8212 (Fig. 81.35). This has two modes of operation selected by the mode input, MD. With MD at
0 the device acts as an input port and a peripheral unit can enter data on the DI lines by sending a high strobe
