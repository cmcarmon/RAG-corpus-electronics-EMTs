At this point, we know the value of each branch current and of the total current in the
circuit. We know that the total current in a parallel circuit must equal the sum of the branch
currents, but thereâ€™s more going on in this circuit than just that. Taking a look at the currents
at each wire junction point (node) in the circuit, we should be able to see something else:
