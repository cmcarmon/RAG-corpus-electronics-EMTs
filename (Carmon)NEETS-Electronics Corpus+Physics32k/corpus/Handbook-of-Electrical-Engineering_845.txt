The  poles  are  jw  and  â€“jw,  which  have  zero  real  parts;  that  is,  they  are  on  the  imaginary  axis  of  the  s-plane.
Since they are single poles, the equilibrium state is stable but not asymptotically stable. A system such as this
would produce constant amplitude sinusoids at frequency w. So it seems natural to assume that such systems
would be used to build sinusoidal signal generators and to model oscillating systems. However, this is not the
case,  because  (1)  zero  resistance  circuits  are  hard  to  make;  therefore,  most  function  generators  use  other
