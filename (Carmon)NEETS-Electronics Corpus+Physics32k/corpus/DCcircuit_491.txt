The ”table” method presented for both series and parallel circuits in this chapter is a good
way to keep the context of Ohm’s Law correct for any kind of circuit conﬁguration. In a table
like the one shown below, you are only allowed to apply an Ohm’s Law equation for the values
of a single vertical column at a time:
