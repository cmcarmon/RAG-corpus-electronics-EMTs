A TORQUE SYNCHRO SYSTEM consists of a torque transmitter (TX) electrically connected to a 
torque receiver (TR). In this system, the mechanical input to the TX is transmitted electrically to the TR. 
The TR reproduces the signal from the TX and positions either a dial or a pointer to indicate the 
transmitted information.
