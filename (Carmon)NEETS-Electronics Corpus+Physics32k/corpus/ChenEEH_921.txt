Observe that either knowing or deliberately choosing sb not
only provides sufﬁcient information to determine the cor-
responding sc (respectively, the entire s) but also permits
computation of the clock delays tcd to implement the desired
clock schedule s. Speciﬁcally, the dependencies among the
clock skews in the branches (the local data paths) and
the clock delays to the vertices (the registers) can be described
in matrix form as follows:
