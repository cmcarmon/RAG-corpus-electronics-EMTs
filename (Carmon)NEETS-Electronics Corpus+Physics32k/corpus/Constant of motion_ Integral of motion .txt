A constant of motion may be defined in a given force field as any function of phase-space coordinates (position and velocity, or position and momentum) and time that is constant throughout a trajectory. A subset of the constants of motion are the integrals of motion, or first integrals, defined as any functions of only the phase-space coordinates that are constant along an orbit. Every integral of motion is a constant of motion, but the converse is not true because a constant of motion may depend on time. Examples of integrals of motion are the angular momentum vector,




L

×

v



{\displaystyle \mathbf {L} =\mathbf {x} \times \mathbf {v} }
, or a Hamiltonian without time dependence, such as



H

Φ

{\displaystyle H(\mathbf {x} ,\mathbf {v} )={\frac {1}{2}}v^{2}+\Phi (\mathbf {x} )}
. An example of a function that is a constant of motion but not an integral of motion would be the function
