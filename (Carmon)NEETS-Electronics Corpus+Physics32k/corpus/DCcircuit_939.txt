To analyze the above circuit, one would ﬁrst ﬁnd the equivalent of R2 and R3 in parallel,
then add R1 in series to arrive at a total resistance. Then, taking the voltage of battery B1 with
that total circuit resistance, the total current could be calculated through the use of Ohm’s
Law (I=E/R), then that current ﬁgure used to calculate voltage drops in the circuit. All in all,
a fairly simple procedure.
