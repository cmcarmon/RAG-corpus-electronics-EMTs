Due to normal molecular activity, there are always ions present in any material. If the number of
positive ions and negative ions is equal, the material is electrically neutral. When the number of positive
ions exceeds the number of negative ions, the material is positively charged. The material is negatively
charged whenever the negative ions outnumber the positive ions.
