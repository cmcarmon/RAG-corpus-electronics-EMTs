Before you insert your multimeter into the circuit, switch your multime-
ter to measure DC current in milliamps (a range of 20 mA is fine). Then, 
move the resistor lead that is connected to the pot to another column 
in your breadboard (or just leave the disconnected lead hanging). Now 
you’ve broken the circuit.
Connect the positive multimeter lead to the open side of the 1 kΩ resis-
tor and the negative multimeter lead to the open side of the pot. Note 
the current reading.
Is this the reading you expect to get by applying Ohm’s Law to your cir-
cuit? Remember that because the pot is dialed all the way down to 0 Ω, 
the total resistance in your circuit — let’s call that Rtotal — is roughly 1 kΩ.
You should expect a current of roughly 9 mA because
