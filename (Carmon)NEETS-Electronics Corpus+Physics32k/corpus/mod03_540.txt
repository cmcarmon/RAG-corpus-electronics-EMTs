During preventive maintenance you should check for charred or burned insulation on the relay and
for darkened or charred terminal leads. Both of these indicate overheating, and the likelihood of relay
breakdown. One possible cause for overheating is that the power terminal connectors are not tight. This
would allow arcing at the connection.
