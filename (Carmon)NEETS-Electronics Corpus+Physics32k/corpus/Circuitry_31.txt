Solution 
 
We will use the formula, R = , l / A.  
  The  value  of  , for  annealed  copper  given  in 
Table  1.5  is  1.724  × 10(cid:1)8 <m.  The  length  of  the 
is  1  mm2 or  
wire 
1 × 10(cid:1)6 m2 (note  that  it  is  important  to  be 
consistent  in  using  units  of  metres  for  length  and 
square metres for area).  
  Hence the resistance of the coil will be given by:
