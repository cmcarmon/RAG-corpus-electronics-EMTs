Exactly  what  the  assembler  or  linker  does  to  replace  the  label  references  with  proper  addresses,  while
interesting, is not particularly germane to our current topic. Note that the range of the branch is somewhat
limited. In the 68000, the maximum branch is –32K and in the VAX a mere +127 to –128. If you need to go
further,  you  must  combine  a  branch  with  a  jump.  For  example,  if  you  were  doing  BEQ  farlabel,  you  would
instead do:
