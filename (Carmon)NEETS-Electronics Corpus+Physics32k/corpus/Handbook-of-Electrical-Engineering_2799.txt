Analog and Mixed-Signal ASICs
One  of  the  exciting  ASIC  areas  undergoing  rapid  development  is  the  addition  of  analog  integrated  circuits
[Geiger  et  al.,  1990;  Ismail  and  Fiez,  1994;  Laker  and  Sansen,  1994]  to  the  standard  digital  VLSI  ASIC,
corresponding to mixed-signal VLSI. Mixed-signal ICs allow the IC to interact directly with the real physical
(and  analog)  world.  Library  cells  representing  various  analog  circuit  functions  supplement  the  usual  digital
circuit cells of the library, allowing the ASIC designer to add needed analog circuits within the same general
framework as the addition of digital circuit cells. Automotive electronics is a representative example, with many
sensors providing analog information which is converted into a digital format and analyzed using microcom-
puters or other digital circuits. Mixed-signal library cells include A/D and D/A converters, comparators, analog
switches, sample-and-hold circuits, etc., while analog library cells include op amps, precision voltage sources,
and phase-locked loops.
