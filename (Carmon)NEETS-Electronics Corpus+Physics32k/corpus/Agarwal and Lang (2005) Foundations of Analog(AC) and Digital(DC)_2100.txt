VT = 1 V K = 1 mA/ V2
For vi(t) a small sinusoidal voltage, choose VI, R, L, and C to give a resonance at
ω = 105 rad/s, Q = 10, and an incremental gain vo/vi at resonance of −2. Use
the incremental model.

The two networks shown in Figure 14.70 are driven in sinu-
soidal steady state by the voltage vI(t) = VI cos(ωt). Their outputs take the form
vO(t) = VO cos(ωt + φ).
