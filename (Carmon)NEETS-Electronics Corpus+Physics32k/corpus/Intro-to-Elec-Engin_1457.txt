An alternative to the FMFB demodulator is the use of a PLL, as shown in Figure 15.2.17,
in which the phase of the VCO’s output signal is forced to follow (or lock to) the phase of
the input FM waveform with small error. Since the VCO acts as an integrator, and phase
is the integral of frequency, the ampliﬁed error voltage appearing at the VCO input will be
proportional to the message signal f (t). The ﬁlter is selected with a closed-loop bandwidth that
is wide enough to yield demodulation with minor distortion of f (t), and narrow enough to reject
noise.
