The compensatory pathways with manual control operations using the visual modality have been extensively
studied. Thousands of experiments have been performed, and most of the adaptive features of human behavior
associated with these kinds of operations are well understood. There are both classical control [e.g., McRuer
and Krendel, 1974; and McRuer et al., 1990] and optimal control [e.g., Baron and Kleinman, 1969; Kleinman
et al., 1970; Curry et al., 1976; and Thompson, 1990] theoretical formulations available to predict steady-state
and dynamic performance.
