As Equation 7.21 demonstrates, the load resistor RL forces an affine rela-
tionship between iDS and vDS. Figure 7.31 plots this affine relationship. The line
representing the affine relationship between the output current and the voltage
forced by the load resistor is called the load line. The slope of the line is inversely
proportional to the load resistance.
