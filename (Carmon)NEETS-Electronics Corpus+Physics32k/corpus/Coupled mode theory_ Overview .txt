The oscillatory systems to which coupled mode theory applies are described by second order partial differential equations (e.g. a mass on a spring, an RLC circuit). CMT allows the second order differential equation to be expressed as one or more uncoupled first order differential equations. The following assumptions are generally made with CMT:
Linearity
Time-reversal symmetry
Time-invariance
Weak mode coupling (small perturbation of uncoupled modes)
Energy conservation
