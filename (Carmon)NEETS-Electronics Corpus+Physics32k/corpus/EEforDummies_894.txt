Avoid using a spray‐on synthetic lubricant (such as WD‐40 and LPS) with 
your electronics projects. Because you can’t control the width of the spray, 
you’re bound to get some on parts that shouldn’t be lubed. Also, some syn-
thetic lubricants are nonconductive, and their fine mist can get in the way, 
interrupting electrical contacts.
