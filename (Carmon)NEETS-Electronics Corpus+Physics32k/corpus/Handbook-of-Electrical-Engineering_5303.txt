Fuel Cells
A  fuel  cell  is  a  simple  static  device  that  converts  the  chemical  energy  in  a  fuel  directly,  isothermally,  and
continuously into electrical energy. Fuel and oxidant (typically oxygen in air) are fed to the device in which an
electrochemical reaction takes place that oxidizes the fuel, reduces the oxidant, and releases energy. The energy
released is in both electrical and thermal forms. The electrical part provides the required output. Since a fuel
cell  completely  bypasses  the  thermal-to-mechanical  conversion  involved  in  a  conventional  power  plant  and
since its operation is isothermal, fuel cells are not Carnot-limited. EfÔ¨Åciencies in the range of 43 to 55% are
forecasted for modular dispersed generators featuring fuel cells.
