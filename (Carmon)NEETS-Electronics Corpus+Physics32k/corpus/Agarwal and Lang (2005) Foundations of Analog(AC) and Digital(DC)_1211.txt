p r o b l e m 8.5
Figure 8.54 depicts a bipolar junction transistor (BJT). Recall that
a BJT has three terminals called the base (B), the collector (C), and the emitter (E).
Figure 8.54 also shows an alternative small-signal model for the BJT operating in its
active region. This model is slightly different from the small-signal BJT model discussed
in this chapter in that it includes a base resistance RB. In the model shown in the figure,
Î² is a constant.
