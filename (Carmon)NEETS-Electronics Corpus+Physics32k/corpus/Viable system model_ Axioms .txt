These axioms are:
The sum of horizontal variety disposed by n operational elements (systems one) equals the sum of the vertical variety disposed by the six vertical components of corporate cohesion. (The six are from Environment, System Three*, the System Ones, System Two, System Three and Algedonic alerts.)
The variety disposed by System Three resulting from the operation of the First Axiom equals the variety disposed by System Four.
The variety disposed by System Five equals the residual variety generated by the operation of the Second Axiom.
