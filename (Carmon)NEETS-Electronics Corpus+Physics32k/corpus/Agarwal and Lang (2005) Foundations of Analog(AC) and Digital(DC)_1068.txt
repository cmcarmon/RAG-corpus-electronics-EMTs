detailed treatment of the SU model for more advanced courses on circuits.
In the rest of this book, we will focus on the S, the SR, and the SCS models.
(cid:1) This chapter also introduced the MOSFET amplifier. The amplifier is an
example of a nonlinear circuit. We chose to operate the amplifier under the
saturation discipline so that it provided a voltage gain for an input signal
and so that the MOSFET operated solely in its saturation region, where
the SCS model applied. We also discussed the application of a DC offset
voltage at the input of the amplifier to boost the signal of interest sufficiently
so that the amplifier operated in saturation for the entire dynamic range
of input signal variation. The application of a DC offset established a DC
operating point for the amplifier.
