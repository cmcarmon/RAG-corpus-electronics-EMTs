The forward blocking operation of the IGBT is identical to
a power MOSFET. The presence of a rectifying junction at the
backside also provides
the device with reverse voltage
blocking capability. A nonpunchthrough (NPT) drift region
design has symmetrical forward and reverse blocking capabil-
ity. The on-state operation of the IGBT can be understood by
an equivalent representation of a MOSFET and a power diode
connected in series. When a positive gate voltage is applied,
an inversion layer is formed under the gate that facilitates the
injection of electrons from the emitter into the drift region.
Positive voltage at the collector simultaneously induces hole
injection into the drift region from the pþ backside layer.
Double injection into the drift region gives the device its
excellent on-state properties. Just like a power diode, the
drift region conductivity is modulated signiﬁcantly during
conduction, which helps reduce the on-state resistance com-
pared to the power MOSFET. The NPT IGBT has a thick drift
region to support the high voltage. The same voltage blocking
capability can be achieved by use of a much thinner drift
region if an nþ buffer layer is introduced between the drift
region and pþ substrate. These punchthrough (PT) IGBTs
exhibit stronger conductivity modulation by virtue of a thin-
ner drift region.
