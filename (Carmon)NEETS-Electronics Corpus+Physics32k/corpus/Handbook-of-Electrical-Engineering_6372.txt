In  recent  tests  and  demonstrations,  the  ISO/MPEG-2  source  encoding/decoding  system  has  been  used.
Originally  developed  by  IRT  (Institut  f√ºr  Rundfunktecknik)  in  Germany  as  MUSICAM  (Masking  pattern-
adapted Universal Subband Integrated Coding And Multiplexing), the system works by dividing the original
digital audio source into 32 subbands. As with the source encoders described earlier, each of the bands is digitally
processed to remove redundant information and sounds that are not perceptible to the human ear. Using this
technique, the original audio, sampled at a rate of 768 kilobits/s per channel, is reduced to as little as 96 kilobits/s
per channel, representing a compression ratio of 8:1.
