On 11 February 2016, the LIGO/EGO collaboration announced the detection of gravitational waves, from a signal detected at 10:51 UTC on 14 September 2015 of two black holes with masses of 29 and 36 solar masses merging around 1.3 billion light years away. The mass of the new black hole obtained from merging the two was 62 solar masses. Energy equivalent to 3 solar masses was emitted as gravitational waves. The signal was seen by both LIGO detectors, in Livingston and Hanford, with a time difference of 7 milliseconds due to the angle between the two detectors and the source. The signal came from the Southern Celestial Hemisphere, in the rough direction of (but much further away than) the Magellanic Clouds. The confidence level of the discovery was 99.99994%. The research made by the Rochester Institute of Technology contributed to the discovery.
