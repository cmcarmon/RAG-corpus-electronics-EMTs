The maximum allowable power dissipation or power rating is typically speciﬁed for com-
mercial resistors. A common power rating for resistors used in electronic circuits is 1Ⲑ4 W; other
ratings such as 1Ⲑ8, 1Ⲑ2, 1, and 2 W are available with composition-type resistors, whereas larger
ratings are also available with other types. Variable resistors, known as potentiometers, with a
movable contact are commonly found in rotary or linear form. Wire-wound potentiometers may
have higher power ratings up to 1000 W.
