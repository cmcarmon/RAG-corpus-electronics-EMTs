The Wheatstone bridge 
 
The Wheatstone bridge forms the basis of a number 
of useful  electronic  circuits  including  several  that 
are used in instrumentation and measurement.  
  The basic form of Wheatstone bridge is shown in 
Fig. 3.13. The voltage developed between A and B 
will be zero when the voltage between A and Y is 
the same as that between B and Y. In effect, R1 and 
R2 constitute a potential divider as do R3 and R4.
