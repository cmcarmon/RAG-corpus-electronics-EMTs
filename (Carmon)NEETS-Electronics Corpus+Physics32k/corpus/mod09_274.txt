To ensure that the amplitude of the signal remains constant, regenerative feedback is supplied to the 
tank once each cycle, as follows: As the voltage across C1 reaches maximum negative, C1 begins 
discharging toward 0 volts. Q1 is still below cutoff. C1 continues to discharge through 0 volts and 
becomes positively charged. The tank circuit voltage is again coupled to the base of Q1, so the base 
voltage becomes positive and allows collector current to flow. The collector current creates a magnetic
