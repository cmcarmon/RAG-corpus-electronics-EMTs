14.11  Figure 14.42 shows the display provided by 
an RF power meter. Explain why the scale is 
 
non-linear  and  illustrate  your  answer  with 
 
 
reference to a formula. 
14.12  Figure  14.43  shows  a  test  set-up  for  radio 
servicing.  Identify  the  test  instruments  and 
 
 
state a typical application for each. 
14.13  Using  a  sine  wave 
 
 
 
 
 
 
14.14  With  the  aid  of  sketches,  show  how  a 
reference square  wave input  can be used to 
 
quickly assess the frequency response of an 
 
 
amplifier. 
14.15  Explain the purpose of each of the following 
facilities/adjustments  provided  on  a  bench 
 
oscilloscope: 
 
(a) timebase selector 
 
 
(b) trigger source 
(c) trigger slope 
 
(d) a.c.-d.c.-ground selector 
 
(e) scale illumination 
 
 
(f) astigmatism 
 
(g) calibrator. 
14.16  Explain, with the aide of a sketch, how you 
would  use  an  oscilloscope    to  measure  the 
 
 
rise  time  and  period  of  a  rectangular  pulse.
