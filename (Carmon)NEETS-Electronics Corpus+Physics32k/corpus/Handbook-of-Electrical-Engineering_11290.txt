if a pacemaker is warranted. Symptoms may include syncope, dizziness, seizures, heart failure, depression, and
dementia. Although bradycardia accounts for the majority of implantations, pacemakers can be used to treat
some  tachycardias.  Antitachycardia  pacing  is  a  special  type  of  pacing  that  may  be  indicated  for  atrial  or
ventricular tachycardias; however, when managing ventricular tachycardias, an ICD is preferable to a pacemaker
so that, if the tachycardia degenerates into ventricular ﬁbrillation, it can be halted with a deﬁbrillation shock.
Pacemaker implants may be permanent or temporary.
