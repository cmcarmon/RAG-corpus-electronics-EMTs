The solution procedure described above is called the
method of moments because equation 8.10 is equivalent to
taking the moments of equation 8.9. It is also known as the
weighted residual method because equation 8.10 can be in-
terpreted as setting the weighted residual of equation 8.9 to
zero. The solution procedure works for both differential and
integral operators. In fact, it is a widely used procedure to
formulate the well-known ﬁnite element method (Jin, 1993).
In the computational electromagnetics community, the name
of the moment method is reserved for the case when L is an
integral operator involving a Green’s function.
