modeled as in Figure 7.13. For the Ô¨Åeld circuit, there is a time
constant associated with the winding inductance and resis-
tance. Together, these describe the basic electromagnetic time
constants for a simple generator model. There is often a sup-
plementary stabilization control on large units referred to as a
power system stabilizer (PSS). The interested reader is referred
to the literature.
