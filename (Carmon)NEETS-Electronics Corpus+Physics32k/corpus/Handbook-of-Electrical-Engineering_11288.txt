Pacemakers
The pacemaker is a medical device capable of controlling the heart rate through a set of implanted electrode
leads  (Fig. 115.11).  The  ﬁrst  devices  in  1958  were  simple,  ﬁxed  rate  oscillators  controlled  by  two  transistors
[Elmquist and Senning, 1960]. Weighing more than 180 grams, they had a lifetime of around 3 years and paced
only  the  ventricles  [Sanders  and  Lee,  1996].  More  sophisticated  dual-chamber  pacemakers,  which  sense  and
pace both the atria and the ventricles independently, were introduced in the late 1970s [Funke, 1982]. Modern
pacemakers have shrunk to less than 15 grams (6 ccs) and evolved into sophisticated, implantable computers
capable of complex pacing algorithms, telemetry, extensive diagnostics, data storage, and a lifetime greater than
5 years [Sanders and Lee, 1996].
