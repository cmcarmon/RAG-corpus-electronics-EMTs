Let (S=N )1 be the value of signal-to-noise ratio of a single
pulse required to produce given probability of detection, and
let (S=N )n be the value of signal-to-noise ratio per pulse
required to produce the same probability of detection when
n pulses are integrated. The integration improvement factor
is deÔ¨Åned as the ratio of (S=N )1 to (S=N )n, which is the
improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio when n pulses are
postdetection integrated.
