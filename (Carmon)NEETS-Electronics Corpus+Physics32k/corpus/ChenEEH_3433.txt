Selectivity
One criterion often used to describe how reliable a relaying
scheme is relates to the relay ability to differentiate between a
variety of operating options it is designed for. This criterion is
called relay selectivity. It may be attributed to the relay accu-
racy, relay settings, or, in some instances, the measuring ca-
pabilities of the relay. In all cases, it designates how well the
relay has recognized the fault conditions that it is designed or
set to operate for. An example of the selectivity problem is an
