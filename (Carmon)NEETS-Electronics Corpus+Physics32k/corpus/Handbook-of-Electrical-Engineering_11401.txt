The use of ultrasound for motion detection and measurement has increased tremendously in recent years.
Most of these systems use the Doppler principle, but some use time domain detection. In Doppler detection,
if the ultrasound is reï¬‚ected from a target moving at some speed vt toward (away from) the source at an angle
q with respect to the beam axis, the frequency of the transmitted signal f is shifted up (down) by an amount
fD, the Doppler shift, according to the following relation:
