As we have mentioned previously, a layer is deﬁned by the types of services it provides to its users. In the
 of the layer in
case of a request or a response, these services are provided via invocation of 
question by the layer that wants the service performed. In the case of an indication or a conﬁrm, these services
are provided via invocation of service primitives of the layer in question by the same layer that wants the service
performed.
