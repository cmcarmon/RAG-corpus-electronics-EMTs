There are two complications to Figure 12.36 that we have not studied so far. The first
complication is that RTH is different for the rising and falling transitions. However,
this complication is inconsequential because RTH is piecewise constant. Thus, we can
separately analyze the rising transient during which RTH = 900 , and the falling
transient during which RTH = 90 . Note too that the circuit remains linear even
though RTH is time varying.
