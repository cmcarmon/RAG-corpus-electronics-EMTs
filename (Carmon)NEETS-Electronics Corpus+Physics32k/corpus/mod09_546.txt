Figure 4-14, view (A), shows a parallel-negative limiter with positive bias. The operation is similar 
to those circuits already explained. Limiting occurs when the diode conducts. No limiting occurs when 
the diode is reverse biased. In this circuit, the bias battery provides forward bias to the diode without an 
input signal. The output is at +4 volts, except where the input goes above +4 volts (T1 to T2), as shown in 
view (B). The parts of the signal more negative than +4 volts are limited.
