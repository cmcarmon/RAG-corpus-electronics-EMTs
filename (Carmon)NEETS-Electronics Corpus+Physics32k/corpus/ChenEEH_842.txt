A synchronous digital system is a network of combinational
logic and storage registers whose input and output terminals are
interconnected by wires. An example of a synchronous system is
shown in Figure 4.1. The sets of registers and logic gates of this
speciﬁc system are outlined in Figure 4.1 and consist of the four
