The problem of monitoring pipelined RISC processors was
addressed in (Delord and Savcier, 1991). The main idea was
that the reference signatures were computed on the basis of the
instruction sequence fetched by the main processor, and the
basic functions of the pipeline were imitated in the WD.
Delayed branching and exceptions events, which make a clas-
sical signature inconsistent, are handled by some new notions.
Delayed branching is resolved by anticipated signatures (i.e.,
always taking into account in the compaction the delayed
instructions following a branch, independent of whether they
are executed). Exceptions and the corresponding ï¬‚ush of the
pipeline are handled by delayed signatures (i.e., an instruction
code is compacted only if a given number of successors are
regularly fetched).
