1. Direct view storage tubes (DVST): These devices were the primary displays used in earlier systems. These
vector drawing devices stored their images on a grid, which was continually bombarded with electrons
in  order  to  transfer  the  image  to  the  screen.  The  advantage  was  that  once  the  image  was  drawn,  the
refresh process took place independently of the complexity of the image, thereby producing a constant
image on the screen. The disadvantage of these systems was that no part of the image could be selectively
erased without erasing the entire grid and resending the modiÔ¨Åed image to the display.
