The ordering of the applicationâ€™s memory accesses in time
determines how much memory bandwidth is needed. This
memory bandwidth comes at a cost. Therefore, an estimation
model of the memory bandwidth cost is required to steer the
ordering of the memory accesses. Scheduling algorithms can
then be used to optimize this cost; for example, the ones
proposed by us (Wuytack et al., 1996; Brockmeyer et al.,
2000; Omne`s et al., 2000), directly support the background
memory cost in a global way. Manually exploring possible
orderings and evaluating the resulting memory bandwidth is
infeasible, so tool support is essential for this step.
