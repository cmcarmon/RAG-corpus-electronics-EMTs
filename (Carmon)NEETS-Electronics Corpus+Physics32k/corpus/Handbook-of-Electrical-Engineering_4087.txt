Speciﬁcations
In  the  United  States,  the  Federal  Communications  Commission  (FCC)  and  the  military  (MIL)  are  the  two
regulating  bodies  governing  the  EMC  standards  for  commercial  and  military-based  electronic  devices  and
systems. In Europe, each country has its own EMC governing body as well as its own standards. The Verband
Deutscher Elektrotechniker (VDE), British Standards Institute (BSI), European Telecommunications Standards
Institute (ETSI), and International Special Committee on Radio Interference (CISPR) standards are very few
examples  of  the  acceptable  standards  in  European  countries  such  as  Germany  and  Great  Britain.  Not  until
January 1, 1996, more than 15 European countries have adopted the IEC 1000 Part 4 Sections 2 to 4 as common
EMI/EMC standards with several additional sections being in the ﬁnal stages of approval.
