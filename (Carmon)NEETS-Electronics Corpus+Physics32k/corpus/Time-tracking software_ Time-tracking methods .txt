There are several ways companies track employee time using time tracking software.
Durational
Employees enter the duration of the task but not the times when it was performed.
Chronological
Employees enter start and end times for the task.
Automatic
The system automatically calculates time spent on tasks or whole projects, using a connected device or a personal computer, and user input using start and stop buttons. Users can retrieve logged tasks and view the duration, or the start and stop times.
Exception-based
The system automatically records standard working hours except for approved time off or LOA.
Clock-in clock-out
Employees manually record arrival and departure times.
Monitoring
The system records active and idle time of employees. It might also record screen captures.
Location-based
The system determines the working status of employees based on their location.
Resource-scheduling: by scheduling resources in advance, employees schedules can be easily converted to timesheets.
