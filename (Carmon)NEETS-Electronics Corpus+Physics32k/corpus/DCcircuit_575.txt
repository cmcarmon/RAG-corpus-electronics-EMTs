From the right and from the bottom, we have two currents entering the wire connection
labeled as node 3. To the left, we have a single current exiting the node equal in magnitude to
the sum of the two currents entering. To refer to the plumbing analogy: so long as there are
no leaks in the piping, what ﬂow enters the ﬁtting must also exit the ﬁtting. This holds true
for any node (”ﬁtting”), no matter how many ﬂows are entering or exiting. Mathematically, we
can express this general relationship as such:
