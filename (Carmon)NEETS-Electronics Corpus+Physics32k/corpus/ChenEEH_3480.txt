Many indices have been developed for the speciÔ¨Åcation of
electric power quality. A few are listed in Table 10.3. The
most widely used index of power quality is the total harmonic
distortion, which is an index that compares the intensity of
harmonic signals in voltages and currents to the fundamental
component. The main indices are as follows:
