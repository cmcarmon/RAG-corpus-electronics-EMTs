A practical full-wave rectifier circuit is shown in view A of figure 4-6. It uses two diodes (D1 and 
D2) and a center-tapped transformer (T1). When the center tap is grounded, the voltages at the opposite 
ends of the secondary windings are 180 degrees out of phase with each other. Thus, when the voltage at 
point A is positive with respect to ground, the voltage at point B is negative with respect to ground. Let's 
examine the operation of the circuit during one complete cycle.
