Given that any frame in the space can be described by a rotation matrix, the displacement among them can also be described by a rotation matrix. Being




A

0




{\displaystyle A_{0}}
and




A

f




{\displaystyle A_{f}}
two matrices, the angular displacement matrix between them can be obtained as



Δ
A
=

A

f


.

A

{\displaystyle \Delta A=A_{f}.A_{0}^{-1}}
. When this product is performed having a very small difference between both frames we will obtain a matrix close to the identity.
In the limit, we will have an infinitesimal rotation matrix.
