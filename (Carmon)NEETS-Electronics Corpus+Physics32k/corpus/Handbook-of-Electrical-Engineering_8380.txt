Computer engineering is not only a very diverse discipline, but as such it is a subject of very rapid changes
reﬂecting high rate of progress in a variety of disciplines encompassed by computer engineering. The perfor-
mance of digital computers has been doubling steadily every two years while the capacity of the semiconductor
memory has been quadrupling every three years. The price-performance ﬁgure has dropped for two orders of
magnitude in the last ten years. This trend has radically changed the way the computer is perceived today. From
exclusive and expensive machines, affordable to only a few, it has become a commodity. For example, an average
automobile today contains in the order of 20 processors controlling various aspects of the machine function,
brake system, navigation, etc.
