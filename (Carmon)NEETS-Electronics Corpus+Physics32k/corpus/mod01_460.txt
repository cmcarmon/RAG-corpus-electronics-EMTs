To construct any graph of electrical quantities, it is standard practice to vary one quantity in a
specified way and note the changes which occur in a second quantity. The quantity which is intentionally
varied is called the independent variable and is plotted on the horizontal axis. The horizontal axis is
known as the X-AXIS. The second quantity, which varies as a result of changes in the first quantity, is
called the dependent variable and is plotted on the vertical, or Y-AXIS. Any other quantities involved are
held constant.
