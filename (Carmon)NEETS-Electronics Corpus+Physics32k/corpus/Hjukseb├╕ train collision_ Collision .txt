The runaway cars had travelled for almost three kilometres before they ploughed into the incoming express, and the speed was probably around 60 km/h. The express train was moving at 70â€“75 km/h, in spite of its emergency brake being pulled in the seconds before the collision.
The leading freight car in the runaway was loaded with wooden logs for setting up telegraph poles, and this added to the damage. The cargo ripped open the front car of the express train where the train driver and 19 passengers were sitting. The driver and 11 passengers were killed instantly, and a further 2 died later from their injuries. The survivors in the front carriage had sustained serious injuries.
