An essential operation in communicating by satellite is the acquisition (locating) of the satellite by 
the earth terminal antenna and the subsequent tracking of the satellite. Initial acquisition depends upon an 
exact knowledge of the position of the satellite. In combination with the geographic location of the earth 
terminal, knowing the position of the satellite enables you to compute accurate antenna pointing 
information. The degree of difficulty in locating and tracking a satellite is determined largely by what 
type orbit the satellite is in.
