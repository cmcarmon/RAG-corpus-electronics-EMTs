Gunshot wounds are classified according to the speed of the projectile, as low, medium, or high velocity; generally, a low-velocity projectile is defined as 1,200 ft/s (370 m/s) or less, medium as 1,200 ft/s (370 m/s) to 2,500 ft/s (760 m/s), and high as greater than 2,500 ft/s (760 m/s). Bullets from handguns are generally less than 1,000 ft/s (300 m/s), while bullets from rifles exceed 2,500 ft/s (760 m/s). The US military commonly uses 5.56-mm bullets, which have a relatively low mass as compared with other bullets; however, the speed of these bullets is relatively fast. As a result, they produce a larger amount of kinetic energy, which is transmitted to the tissues of the target.
