Such redundancies can be reduced to a large extent through the use of logical links. A logical link associates
a  virtual  record  from  a  hierarchical  schema  with  an  actual  record  from  either  the  same  schema  or  another
schema. The redundant copy of the actual record is therefore replaced by a virtual record, which is nothing
more than a pointer to the actual one.
