In this equation DV is another diffusion constant of the form A exp(–B/kT). R and G represent the recom-
bination and generation of vacancies and interstitials. Note that an interstitial and a vacancy may recombine
and in the process destroy each other, or an interstitial and a vacancy pair may be simultaneously generated
by  knocking  a  silicon  atom  off  its  lattice  site.  Recombination  can  occur  anywhere  in  the  device  via  a  bulk
recombination  process  R  =  A(CV C1)exp(–B/kT).  Generation  occurs  where  there  is  damage  to  the  crystal
structure,  in  particular  at  interfaces  where  oxide  is  being  grown  or  in  regions  where  ion  implantation  has
occurred, as the high-energy ions can knock silicon atoms off their lattice sites.
