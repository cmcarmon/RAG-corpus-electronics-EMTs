The principal source of energy comes from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil
to generate steam, which drives steam turbines, which in turn drive electric generators. Other
important energy sources are hydroelectric and nuclear. In the former, electric generators are
driven by waterwheel (hydraulic) turbines near natural or human-made waterfalls; in the latter,
nuclear reactions generate heat to drive the steam-turbineâ€“generator chain. There are also other
less widely used sources of energy such as geothermal sources, wind, sun, and tides.
