A watchdog processor (WD) is a relatively small and simple
coprocessor used to perform concurrent system-level error
detection by monitoring the behavior of the main processor.
Because the WD is much simpler than the processor being
tested, this approach is signiﬁcantly more inexpensive than
if system-level redundancy techniques, like duplication, were
used. A WD can also be added incrementally to an existing
processor system without requiring any signiﬁcant modiﬁca-
tion to it. The general conﬁguration of a system with a WD is
shown in Figure 8.10.
