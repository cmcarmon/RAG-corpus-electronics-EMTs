An AMMETER measures current. It is always connected in series with the circuit being measured.
An ammeter should have a small resistance so the effect of the ammeter on the circuit will be kept to a
minimum. Ammeter sensitivity is the amount of current that causes 0 full scale deflection of the ammeter.
Shunt F resistors are used to provide an ammeterâ€™s ranges.
