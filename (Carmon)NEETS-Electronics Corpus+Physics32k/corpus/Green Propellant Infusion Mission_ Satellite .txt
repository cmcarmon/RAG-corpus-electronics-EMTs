The GPIM system will fly aboard the small Ball Configurable Platform 100 (BCP 100) spacecraft bus. Aerojet Rocketdyne is responsible for the development of the propulsion system payload, and the technology demonstration mission will employ an Aerojet-developed advanced monopropellant payload module as the sole means of on-board propulsion.
