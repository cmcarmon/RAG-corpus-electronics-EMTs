These expressions tell us that the slip at maximum torque is
proportional to the rotor resistance but that the pull-out
torque is independent of the rotor resistance. Figure 4.20
shows the torque slip curves for an induction motor with
different values of rotor resistance. As the rotor resistance
increases, the starting torque increases, but the running speed
decreases and the losses increase. The increase of starting
torque is obtained at the expense of lower running efÔ¨Åciency.
