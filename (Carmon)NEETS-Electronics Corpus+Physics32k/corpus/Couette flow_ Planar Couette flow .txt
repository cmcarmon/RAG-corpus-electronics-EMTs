Couette flow is frequently used in undergraduate physics and engineering courses to illustrate shear-driven fluid motion. The simplest conceptual configuration finds two infinite, parallel plates separated by a distance



h


{\displaystyle h}
. One plate, say the top one, translates with a constant velocity



U


{\displaystyle U}
in its own plane. Neglecting pressure gradients, the Navierâ€“Stokes equations simplify to

,


{\displaystyle {\frac {d^{2}u}{dy^{2}}}=0,}

where



y


{\displaystyle y}
is a spatial coordinate normal to the plates and



u
(
y
)


{\displaystyle u(y)}
is the velocity distribution. This equation reflects the assumption that the flow is uni-directional. That is, only one of the three velocity components



(
u
,
v
,
w
)


{\displaystyle (u,v,w)}
is non-trivial. If y originates at the lower plate, the boundary conditions are



u
(
0
)
=
0


{\displaystyle u(0)=0}
and



u
(
h
)
=
U


{\displaystyle u(h)=U}
. The exact solution




u
(
y
)
=
U


y
h




{\displaystyle u(y)=U{\frac {y}{h}}}

can be found by integrating twice and solving for the constants using the boundary conditions. A notable aspect of the flow is that shear stress is constant throughout the flow domain. In particular, the first derivative of the velocity,



U

/

h


{\displaystyle U/h}
, is constant. (This is implied by the straight-line profile in the figure.) According to Newton's Law of Viscosity (Newtonian fluid), the shear stress is the product of this expression and the (constant) fluid viscosity.
