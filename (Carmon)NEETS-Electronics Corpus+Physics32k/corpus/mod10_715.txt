An end-fire array looks similar to a broadside array. The ladder-like appearance is characteristic of 
both (fig. 4-28, view A). The currents in the elements of the end-fire array, however, are usually 180 
degrees out of phase with each other as indicated by the arrows. The construction of the end-fire array is 
like that of a ladder lying on its side (elements horizontal). The dipoles in an end-fire array are closer 
together (1/8-wavelength to 1/4 -wavelength spacing) than they are for a broadside array.
