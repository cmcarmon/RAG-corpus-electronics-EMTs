The characterization of dielectric materials must be carried out in order to determine their properties for
various applications over different parts of the electromagnetic frequency spectrum. There are many techniques
and methods available for this purpose that are too numerous and detailed to attempt to present here even in
a cursory manner. However, Fig. 55.3 portrays schematically the different test methods that are commonly used
to carry out the characterization over the different frequencies up to and including the optical regime. A direct
relationship exists between the time and frequency domain test methods via the Laplace transforms.
