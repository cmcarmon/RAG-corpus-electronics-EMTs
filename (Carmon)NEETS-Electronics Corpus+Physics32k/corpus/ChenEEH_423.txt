Since v0 is proportional to gm, which in turn depends on a bias
current or voltage, the pole frequency can be tuned by varying
the circuitâ€™s bias. Automatic electronic tuning techniques have
been developed for this purpose. In addition, note that Q, as a
dimensionless parameter, is set by ratios of like components
