An introduction to modeling of multinature systems is
best given by discussing the role of models and of associ-
ated abstraction levels in the design process as presented in
the ﬁrst section. The representation of abstract models should
then allow for an execution and assessment of the captured
speciﬁcation. VHDL–AMS has been introduced as a highly
expressive description language for the representation of
mixed time-continuous and event-discrete operating embed-
ded systems. The advantages for a design engineer, which
result
from the proposed modeling methodology, have
been demonstrated for a practical multinature application
example.
