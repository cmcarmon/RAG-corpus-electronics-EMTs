The loading criteria in Table 61.6 do not include all types of double-contingency outages. For example, the
outage of a double-circuit transmission line or two transmission lines in the same right-of-way is not included.
Also,  the  loss  of  two  transformers  in  the  same  load  area  is  not  included.  Under  these  double-contingency
outages, it may be necessary to shed load at some locations during heavy load periods. Although experience
has shown that these outages are relatively unlikely, their consequences should be evaluated in speciÔ¨Åc situations.
Factors to be evaluated include the size of load served, the degree of risk, and the cost of reinforcement.
