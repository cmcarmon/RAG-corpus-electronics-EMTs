The basic principle is that the hardware programmability of
RC is combined with a general-purpose processing capability
of the RISC microprocessor. The interface between these two
can be either closely or loosely coupled depending on its
applications. How frequently an RC’s functionality should be
reconﬁgured must be determined based on the performance
criteria of particular HW/SW architecture. Unlike the long
conﬁguration latency of the FPGA, RC is attributed by its
low-latency dynamic conﬁgurability.
