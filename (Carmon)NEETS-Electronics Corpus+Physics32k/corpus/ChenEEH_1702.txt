video shot using an iterative algorithm for the computation
of PCA. EfÔ¨Åcient representation of the dc frames is obtained
by their projection onto the eigenspace characterized by the
dominant eigenvectors for the video shot. The eigenvectors
obtained by PCA can also be used for conventional keyframe
representation of the video shot by considering the similarity
of frames in the video shot to the eigenvectors with the largest
eigenvalues.
