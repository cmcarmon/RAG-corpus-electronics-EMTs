The function of a frequency-modulated receiver is the same as that of an AM superheterodyne
receiver. You will find some important differences in component construction and circuit design caused
by differences in the modulating technique. Figure 2-10 is a block diagram showing waveforms of a
typical fm superheterodyne receiver. Comparison of block diagrams in figures 2-9 and 2-10 shows that in
both AM and fm receivers, the amplitude of the incoming signal is increased in the rf stages. The mixer
