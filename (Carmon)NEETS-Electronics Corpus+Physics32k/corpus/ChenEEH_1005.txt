FIGURE 5.9 Dynamic Power Dissipation. (A) This ﬁgure shows a static CMOS inverter, the output charges using the PMOS transistor, and
discharges through the NMOS transistor. (B) The waveform shows the function of the inverter output (out) with respect to the input (in) (C)
Shown here is the circuit equivalent when the input falls and the corresponding output rises. (D) The ﬁgure illustrates the circuit equivalent
when the input rises and the corresponding output falls.
