Attribute Sets: Closed Convex Sets
Although the case in which the signal attribute sets are closed subspaces is of theoretical interest, it is typically
found to be too restrictive for most practical applications. As we will now see, however, it is possible to extend
these concepts to the more general case of closed convex attribute sets. The set C is said to be convex if for any
two vectors x,y ˛  C their convex sum as deﬁned by l  x + (1 – l)y is also contained in C for all 0 £ l £  1. The
ability  to  broaden  the  class  of  attribute  sets  to  include  closed  convex  sets  signiﬁcantly  expands  the  class  of
problems  that  can  be  treated  by  signal  restoration.  The  following  well-known  functional  analysis  theorem
provides the framework for this development.
Theorem 4. Let  C be a nonempty closed convex set of Hilbert space X. Corresponding to any vector x ˛  X,
there is a unique vector xo ˛  C such that **x – xo** £ **x – y** for all y ˛  C. Furthermore, a necessary and sufﬁcient
condition that xo be the unique minimizing vector is that <x – xo, y – xo> £  0 for all y ˛  C.
