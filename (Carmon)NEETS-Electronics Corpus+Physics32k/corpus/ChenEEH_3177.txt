Aging is the term used to describe irreversible permanent
changes. All materials undergo aging at different rates. Because
organic materials are more susceptible to changes from the
environment and applied stress, it is more common to talk of
aging with composite insulators than it is with porcelain and
glass insulators. However, it should be mentioned that even
porcelain and glass insulators are subjected to aging.
