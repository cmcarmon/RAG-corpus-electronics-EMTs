Low-Noise Ampliﬁer
A low-noise ampliﬁer (LNA) is commonly found in all re-
ceivers. Its role is to boost the received signal a sufﬁcient level
above the noise ﬂoor so that it can be used for additional
processing. The noise ﬁgure of the LNA therefore directly
limits the sensitivity of the receiver. Minimum noise perform-
ance, Fmin, occurs with a source termination with reﬂection
coefﬁcient Gopt . The noise ﬁgure of a two-port ampliﬁer is
given as:
