Opens and shorts alike, if occurring in a circuit, result in an overall change in the equivalent
resistance. This can cause undesirable effects in other parts of the circuit due to the corresponding change
in the total current flow. A short usually causes components to fail in a circuit which is not properly fused
or otherwise protected. The failure may take the form of a burned-out resistor, damaged source, or a fire
in the circuit components and wiring.
