Typical fire-control radar characteristics include a very high prf, a very narrow pulse width, and a
very narrow beam width. These characteristics, while providing extreme accuracy, limit the range and
make initial target detection difficult. A typical fire-control radar antenna is shown in figure 1-28. In this
example the antenna used to produce a narrow beam is covered by a protective radome.
