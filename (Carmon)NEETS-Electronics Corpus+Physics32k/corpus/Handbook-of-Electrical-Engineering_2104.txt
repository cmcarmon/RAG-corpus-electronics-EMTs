In active sonar, the ﬁlters are matched to the known transmitted waveforms. If the object (acoustic reﬂector)
has motion, it will induce Doppler on the reﬂected signal, and the receiver will be complicated by the addition
of a bank of Doppler compensators. Returns from a moving object are shifted in frequency by D  f = (2v/c)f,
where v  is the relative velocity (range rate) between the source and object, c is the speed of sound in water, and
f is the operating frequency of the source transmitter.
