MESFET is better suited to materials that do not have a good
dielectric to form a high-quality MOS gate. Today, MESFETs
are commonly fabricated on compound semiconductors,
predominantly GaAs. Because of high mobility of carriers in
GaAs and low capacitance due to the semi-insulating GaAs,
MESFETs have the speed advantage over MOSFETs. They are
used in microwave applications, which require high-speed
devices. Application areas
include communication, high-
speed computer, and military systems.
