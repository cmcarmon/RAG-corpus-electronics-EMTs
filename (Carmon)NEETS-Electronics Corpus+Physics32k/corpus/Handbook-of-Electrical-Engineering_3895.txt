approximations  can  be  introduced  that  allow  solution  to  the  wave  equations. Approximating  spherical  wave
fronts as quadratics has been shown for the synthetic aperture application and is valid when the propagation
distance  is  greater  than  (pL2/4l)1/3,  where  L  is  the  aperture  size.  In  general,  this  is  known  as  the  Fresnel or
near-ﬁeld approximation. When the propagation distance is at least 2L2/l, the angular radiation pattern can
be approximated as independent of distance from the aperture. This pattern is known as the normalized far-
ﬁeld or Fraunhofer distribution,  E(q), and is related to the normalized current distributed across an antenna
aperture,  i(x), by a Fourier transform:
