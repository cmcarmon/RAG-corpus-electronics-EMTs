The  ability  to  connect  multiple  computers  through  a  communications  network  has  existed  for  many  years.
Initially, computer-to-computer communication consisted of a small number of systems performing bulk ﬁle
 or LANs. A LAN allows hundreds
transfers. The 1980s brought the invention of high-speed 
 that allowed
of machines to be connected together. New capabilities began to emerge, such as 
a  user  to  log  on  to  a  computer  without  being  physically  connected  to  that  system.  Networks  were  used  to
provide remote access to printers, disks, and other peripherals. The drawback to these systems was the software;
it was not sophisticated enough to provide a totally integrated environment. Only small, well-deﬁned interac-
tions among machines were permitted.
