The need for regularization terms in any quantum field theory of quantum gravity is a major motivation for Physics beyond the standard model. Infinities of the non-gravitational forces in QFT can be controlled via renormalization only but additional regularization - and hence new physics -- is required uniquely for gravity. The regularizers model, and work around, the break down of QFT at small scales and thus show clearly the need for some other theory to come into play beyond QFT at these scales. A. Zee (Quantum Field Theory in a Nutshell, 2003) considers this to be a benefit of the regularization framework -- theories can work well in their intended domains but also contain information about their own limitations and point clearly to where new physics is needed.
