Kirchhoff’s Current Law in the Complex Domain
Kirchhoff ’s  current  law  is  ordinarily  stated  in  terms  of  the  real  (time-domain)  currents  ﬂowing  in  a  circuit,
because  it  actually  describes  physical  quantities,  at  least  in  a  macroscopic,  statistical  sense.  It  also  applied,
however, to a variety of purely mathematical models that are commonly used to analyze circuits in the so-called
complex domain.
