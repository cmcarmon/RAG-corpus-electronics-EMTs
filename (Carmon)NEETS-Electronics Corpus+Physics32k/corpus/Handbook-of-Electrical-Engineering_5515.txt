Figure 61.24(a)  displays  a  simple  circuit  with  shunt  capacitor  compensation  applied  at  the  load  side.  The
line current IL is the sum of the motor load current IM and the capacitor current Ic. From the current phasor
diagram of Fig. 61.24(b), it is clear that the line current is decreased with the insertion of the shunt capacitor.
Figure 61.24(c) displays the corresponding voltage phasors. The effect of the shunt capacitor is to reduce the
source voltage to Vs1 from Vs 0.
