Before detailing this procedure, let’s clarify why so many new issues arose in trying to develop a frequency-
domain implementation of linear ﬁltering. The frequency-domain relationship between a ﬁlter’s input and
n x (n) e−j2πf n. Unfortunately, using this relationship
to perform ﬁltering is restricted to the situation when we have analytic formulas for the frequency response
and the input signal. The reason why we had to “invent” the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) has the
same origin: The spectrum resulting from the discrete-time Fourier transform depends on the continuous
frequency variable f. That’s ﬁne for analytic calculation, but computationally we would have to make an
uncountably inﬁnite number of computations.
