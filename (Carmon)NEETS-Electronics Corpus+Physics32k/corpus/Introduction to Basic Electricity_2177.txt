Evidence of this “domain theory” is that if a  magnet 
is heated or hit repeatedly with a hammer, it loses 
its magnetism (the domains are jarred back into a 
 random arrangement). Also, if an artificial magnet is 
left by itself, it slowly loses its magnetism. To prevent 
this loss, bar magnets should be stacked on top of each 
other with opposite poles together; keeper bars should 
be placed across horseshoe  magnets (Figure 18-5). 
Both methods maintain the magnetic field.
