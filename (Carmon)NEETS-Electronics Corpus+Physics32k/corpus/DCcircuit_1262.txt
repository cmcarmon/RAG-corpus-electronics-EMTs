In a capacitor, however, time is an essential variable, because current is related to how
rapidly voltage changes over time. To fully understand this, a few illustrations may be neces-
sary. Suppose we were to connect a capacitor to a variable-voltage source, constructed with a
potentiometer and a battery:
