When there is an input signal applied to a digital ﬁlter,
overﬂow might occur. As a result, input signal scaling is re-
quired to reduce the probability of overﬂow to an acceptable
level. Ideally, signal scaling should be applied to ensure that the
probability of overﬂow is the same at each internal node of the
digital ﬁlter. This way, the signal-to-noise ratio is maximized in
ﬁxed-point implementations.
