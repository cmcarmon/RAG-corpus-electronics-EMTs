the neuromuscular actuation system reﬂected to the crossover region. It follows that the effective time delay,
t
,  is  not  a  constant.  Its  two  major  components  are  (1)  the  effective  composite  time  delay  of  the  controlled
element (including manipulator effects)—the sum of the machine’s lags minus leads at frequencies well above
crossover and (2) the high-frequency dynamics of the human operator approximated by a pure delay which
has an equivalent phase shift at frequencies within the crossover region. The latter includes a minimum of 0.1
second  for  the  neuromuscular  system  and  an  additional  increment  which  depends  on  the  amount  of  lead
generation  required  of  the  human  to  offset  the  controlled  element  deﬁciencies  in  order  to  make  good  the
crossover  model  form.  Figure  105.3  [McRuer  and  Krendel,  1974]  shows  this  variation  for  a  wide  range  of
controlled  elements  (the  neuromuscular  delay  component  is  included).  More  reﬁned  estimates  are  available
[e.g., McRuer et al., 1990], but the above description is suitable for ﬁrst-order estimates of behavior and dynamic
performance.
