A new class of systems for optical control is under development using geometrical feature sizes on the order
of the wavelength of the light. Patterning a metal ﬁlm to produce a high-density array of antenna elements can
achieve an inductive resonance that produces a bandpass ﬁlter. In a somewhat similar way, producing a ﬁne
periodic surface structure on the emitter material can produce wavelength-selective behavior.
