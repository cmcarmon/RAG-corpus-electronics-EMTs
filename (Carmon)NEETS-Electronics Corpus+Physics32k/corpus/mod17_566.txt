The frequency generator part of the frequency generator and fsk block is an oscillator. It provides the 
carrier frequencies for the cw mode. The fsk part is a FREQUENCY SYNTHESIZER (a frequency source 
of high accuracy). It makes both the mark and space frequencies from a very stable clock oscillator. The 
keying pulses determine which fsk frequency the keyer chooses to transmit. This signal is then sent to the 
transmitter control console where it is distributed to the first rf amplifier. This amplifier is referred to as 
the preliminary intermediate-power amplifier (pre-ipa). The pre-ipa uses linear, untuned, push-pull, rf 
amplifiers to provide amplified rf to drive other rf amplifiers. The pre-ipa output goes to the intermediate 
power amplifier (ipa).
