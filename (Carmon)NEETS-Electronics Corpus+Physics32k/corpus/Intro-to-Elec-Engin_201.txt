When a car battery is weak, say 11 V in a 12-V system, in order to jump-start that car, we
bring in another car with its engine running and its alternator charging its battery. Let the healthy
and strong battery have a voltage of 13 V. According to the recommended practice, one should
Ô¨Årst connect the positive terminals with the red jumper cable, as shown in Figure 2.8.1, and then
complete the circuit between the negative terminals with the aid of the black jumper cable. Note
that the negative terminal of any car battery is always connected to its auto chasis.
