This is one of the interfaces where most of the electronics is actually on a controller card mounted in 
the host computer. With this interface, the controller card does most of the work (moving the magnetic 
head, spinning the disk, etc.). The controller card also cleans any data coming from the disk drive by 
stripping off the formatting and control signals that were used to store the data onto the hard disk.
