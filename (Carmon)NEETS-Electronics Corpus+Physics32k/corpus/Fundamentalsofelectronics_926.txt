• Eﬃciency: The Source Coding Theorem allows quantiﬁcation of just how complex a given message
source is and allows us to exploit that complexity by source coding (compression). In analog commu-
nication, the only parameters of interest are message bandwidth and amplitude. We cannot exploit
signal structure to achieve a more eﬃcient communication system.
• Performance: Because of the Noisy Channel Coding Theorem, we have a speciﬁc criterion by which
to formulate error-correcting codes that can bring us as close to error-free transmission as we might
want. Even though we may send information by way of a noisy channel, digital schemes are capable
of error-free transmission while analog ones cannot overcome channel disturbances; see this problem
(Problem 6.15) for a comparison.
• Flexibility: Digital communication systems can transmit real-valued discrete-time signals, which
could be analog ones obtained by analog-to-digital conversion, and symbolic-valued ones (computer
data, for example). Any signal that can be transmitted by analog means can be sent by digital means,
with the only issue being the number of bits used in A/D conversion (how accurately do we need
to represent signal amplitude).
Images can be sent by analog means (commercial television), but
better communication performance occurs when we use digital systems (HDTV). In addition to digital
