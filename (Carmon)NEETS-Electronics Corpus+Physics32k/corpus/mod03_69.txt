The meter in figure 1-3 is not very practical for electrical measurement. The amount the compass
needle swings depends upon the closeness of the compass to the conductor carrying the current, the
direction of the conductor in relation to magnetic north, and the influence of other magnetic fields. In
addition, very small amounts of current will not overcome the magnetic field of the Earth and the needle
will not move.
