Hydraulic torque wrenches are used for tightening large torques with high accuracy. They are used for aviation and heavy machinery assembly and are specialized tools.  Their general construction varies depending on manufacturer and torque requirement. Generally, they consist of at least one hydraulic cylinder operating a drive head ratchet. The cylinder extends, pushing the drive head round via the pawls, and then retracts freely over the ratcheting teeth. The process is repeated until the desired torque is met. Smaller hydraulic torque wrenches have a reaction arm built into the tool, which rests against another fastener or part of the assembly to prevent rotation when torque is being applied. Larger models require other fixing arrangements in order to prevent rotation.
