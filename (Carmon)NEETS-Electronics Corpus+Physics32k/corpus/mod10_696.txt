radiates fairly efficiently in the desired direction toward receiving point X. It radiates equally as 
efficiently toward Y, although no radiation is desired in this direction. The antenna in view B radiates 
strongly to point X, but very little in the direction of point Y, which results in more satisfactory operation.
