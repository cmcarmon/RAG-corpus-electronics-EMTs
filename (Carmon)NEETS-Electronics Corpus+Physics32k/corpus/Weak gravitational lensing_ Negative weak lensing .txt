Minimal coupling of general relativity with scalar fields allows solutions like traversable wormholes stabilized by exotic matter of negative energy density. Moreover, Modified Newtonian Dynamics as well as some bimetric theories of gravity consider invisible negative mass in cosmology as an alternative interpretation to dark matter, which classically has a positive mass.
As the presence of exotic matter would bend spacetime and light differently than positive mass, a Japanese team at the Hirosaki University proposed to use "negative" weak gravitational lensing related to such negative mass.
Instead of running statistical analysis on the distortion of galaxies based on the assumption of a positive weak lensing that usually reveals locations of positive mass "dark clusters", these researchers propose to locate "negative mass clumps" using negative weak lensing, i.e. where the deformation of galaxies is interpreted as being due to a diverging lensing effect producing radial distortions (similar to a concave lens instead of the classical azimuthal distortions of convex lenses similar to the image produced by a fisheye). Such negative mass clumps would be located elsewhere than assumed dark clusters, as they would reside at the center of observed cosmic voids located between galaxy filaments within the lacunar, web-like large-scale structure of the universe. Such test based on negative weak lensing could help to falsify cosmological models proposing exotic matter of negative mass as an alternative interpretation to dark matter.
