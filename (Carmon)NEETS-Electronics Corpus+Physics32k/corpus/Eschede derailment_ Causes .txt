Remains of a VW Golf Variant, belonging to the two railway workers killed in the crash, were found beneath the debris of the crashed ICE. Media first speculated that the train had derailed after a collision with the car, a circumstance that caused a train to jackknife in the Ufton Nervet rail crash six years later; however, this theory was quickly dismissed as the front power car did not receive any damage at all, having continued to coast down the track until it passed the next station.
