The  evolving  deﬁnition  of  a  standards  for Applications  Exchange  (APEX)  software  promises  to  provide  a
common software platform whereby the specialized requirements of varying hardware (processor) requirements
are minimized. APEX software is a hardware interface that provides a common link with the functional software
within an avionics system. The ultimate beneﬁt is the development of software independent of the hardware
platform and the ability to reuse software in systems with advanced hardware while maintaining most, if not
all, of the original software design.
