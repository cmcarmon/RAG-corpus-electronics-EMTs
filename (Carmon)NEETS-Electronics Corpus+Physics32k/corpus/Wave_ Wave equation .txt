Consider a traveling transverse wave (which may be a pulse) on a string (the medium). Consider the string to have a single spatial dimension. Consider this wave as traveling

in the



x


{\displaystyle x}
direction in space. E.g., let the positive



x


{\displaystyle x}
direction be to the right, and the negative



x


{\displaystyle x}
direction be to the left.
with constant amplitude



u


{\displaystyle u}

with constant velocity



v


{\displaystyle v}
, where



v


{\displaystyle v}
is
independent of wavelength (no dispersion)
independent of amplitude (linear media, not nonlinear).

with constant waveform, or shape
This wave can then be described by the two-dimensional functions

{\displaystyle u(x,t)=G(x+v\ t)}

{\displaystyle u(x,t)=F(x-vt)+G(x+vt).\,}
