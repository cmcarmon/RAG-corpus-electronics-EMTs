A partial list would include:
Maximum steady state lateral acceleration (in understeer mode)
Roll stiffness (degrees per g of lateral acceleration)
Ride frequencies
Lateral load transfer percentage distribution front to rear
Roll moment distribution front to rear
Ride heights at various states of load
Understeer gradient
Turning circle
Ackermann
Jounce travel
Rebound travel
Once the overall vehicle targets have been identified they can be used to set targets for the two suspensions. For instance, the overall understeer target can be broken down into contributions from each end using a Bundorf analysis.
