An antenna is seen by the input source as an equivalent
impedance Zin (see Figure 6.1) with real and imaginary parts
Rin and Xin, respectively. The imaginary part is produced due
to stored energy in the antenna ﬁeld. The real part Rin consists
of two parts, Rrad and Rloss respectively contributed due to the
radiated power Prad and the power loss Ploss in the antenna:
Zin ¼ Rin þ jXin ¼ Rrad þ Rloss þ jXin, Rin ¼ Rrad þ Rloss:
