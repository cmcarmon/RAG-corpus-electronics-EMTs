where ˜h(t), hI(t), and hQ(t) are all low-pass functions limited to the frequency band –B ≤ f ≤ B.
Representation of Bandpass Gaussian Noise
If  the  channel  noise  n(t)  is  a  bandpass  Gaussian  random  process  and  its  spectrum  is  symmetric  about  the
carrier frequency fc, then n(t) can also be represented by its complex envelope
