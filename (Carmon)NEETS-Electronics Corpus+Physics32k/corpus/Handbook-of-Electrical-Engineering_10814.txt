improvements  in  design  can  be  achieved;  and  developing  software  tools  that  can  inform  environmentally
preferable design decisions [Seifert, 1995]. In Sweden, the government and Volvo have developed a relatively
simple Environment Priority Strategies for Environmental Design, or EPS, system which uses Environmental
Load Units, or ELUs, to inform materials choices during the design process. In Germany, Siemens Nixdorf has
developed an “Eco-balance” system to help it make design choices that reﬂect both environmental and economic
requirements.  Xerox  is  a  world  leader  in  designing  their  products  for  refurbishment  using  a  product  life
extension approach.
