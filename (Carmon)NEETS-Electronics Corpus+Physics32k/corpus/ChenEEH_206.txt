Circuit elements are models of physical components. Every
physical component is nonlinear. The models that capture
behavior of these components over a wide range of values of
voltages and currents are nonlinear. To some degree of simpli-
ﬁcation, circuit elements may be modeled as linear elements
that allow for an easier analysis and prediction of a circuit’s
behavior. These linear models are convenient simpliﬁcations
that are often valid only over a limited range of the element’s
voltages and currents.
