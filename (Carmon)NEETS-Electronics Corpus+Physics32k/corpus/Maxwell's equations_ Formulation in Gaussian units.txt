Gaussian units are a popular system of units that are part of the centimetre–gram–second system of units (cgs). When using Gaussian units it is conventional to use a slightly different definition of electric field Ecgs = c−1 ESI. This implies that the modified electric and magnetic field have the same units (in the SI convention this is not the case making dimensional analysis of the equations different: e.g. for an electromagnetic wave in vacuum

). The Gaussian system uses a unit of charge defined in such a way that the permittivity of the vacuum ε0 = 1/4πc, hence μ0 = 4π/c. These units are sometimes preferred over SI units in the context of special relativity, in which the components of the electromagnetic tensor, the Lorentz covariant object describing the electromagnetic field, have the same unit without constant factors. Using these different conventions, the Maxwell equations become:
