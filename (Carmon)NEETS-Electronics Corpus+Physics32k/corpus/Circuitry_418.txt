base  our  circuit  on  a  single  operational  amplifier 
configured as an inverting amplifier with capacitors 
to  define  the  upper  and  lower  cut-off  frequencies, 
as shown in the previous figure.  
  The nominal input resistance is the same as the 
value for RIN. Thus:  
 
RIN = 10 kG
To determine the value of RF we can make use of 
the formula for mid-band voltage gain:
