FORWARD AND REVERSE AGC.â€”When we use an agc voltage to cause degeneration by
driving the amplifiers toward cutoff, it is referred to as REVERSE agc. Figure 2-18 shows the type of agc
circuitry normally used with this method. A second method that uses agc is an application called
FORWARD agc. In the case of forward agc, you'll find the amplifier is driven toward the saturation
region of its characteristic curve. (Sometimes referred to as an energy diagram.)
