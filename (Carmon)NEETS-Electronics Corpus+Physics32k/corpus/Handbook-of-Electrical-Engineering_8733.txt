In terms of the mental effort required to write the same program
in different languages, Table 87.4 suggests that a HLL is about twice
as high level as assembler language. That is, the level of abstraction
of PL/I is more than double that of assembler. This abstraction is
used to reduce mental effort and solve the problem faster.
