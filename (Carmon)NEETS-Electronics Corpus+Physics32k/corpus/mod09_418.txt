In a blocking oscillator the pulse width (pw), pulse repetition time (prt), and pulse repetition rate 
(prr) are all controlled by the size of certain capacitors and resistors and by the operating characteristics of 
the transformer. The transformer primary determines the duration and shape of the output. Because of 
their importance in the circuit, transformer action and series RL circuits will be discussed briefly. You 
may want to review transformer action in NEETS, Module 2, Introduction to Alternating Current and 
Transformers before going to the next section.
