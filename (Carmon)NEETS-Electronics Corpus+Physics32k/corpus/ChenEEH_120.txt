one element at a time and to develop the matrix equations on
this basis. Assume that the nodes in a circuit are labeled by
consecutive integers from 1 to N such that there are the N
nodal voltages in the circuit. The reference node is usually
labeled zero. This presentation uses the lowercase letters j, k,
l, and m to denote nodes in the circuit. Voltages will be
denoted by V and branch currents by I. Consider a linear
resistor R connected between nodes j and k as in Figure 3.1.
