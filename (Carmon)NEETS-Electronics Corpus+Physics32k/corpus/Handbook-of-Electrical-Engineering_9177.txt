OCF essentially was created for the Java programming environment and the world of network computing.
Because  of  this,  it  claims  all  the  advantages  that  the  Java  language  provides.  Basically,  any  platform  that  is
capable  of  running  JAVA  can  exploit  OCF  right  away.  Moreover,  OCF  offers  mechanisms  to  allow  one  to
download  from  the  network  missing  components  for  a  particular  card  at  hand  and  plug  them  into  the
framework. As it is for Java, OCF targets embedded systems such as automatic teller machines, point-of-sales
terminals, and hand-held devices (phone, electronic agenda).
