The signiﬁcance of Eq. (28.6) is best appreciated by studying the simple circuit diagram of Fig. 28.12(a), which
depicts the grounded emitter conﬁguration of a BJT biased for linear operation at a quiescent base current of
IB Q and a quiescent collector-emitter voltage of VCEQ. Note that the battery supplying VCEQ grounds the collector
for small signal conditions. The small signal model of the circuit at hand is resultantly seen to be the topology
offered in Fig. 28.12(b), where iBS and iCS, respectively, denote the signal components of the net instantaneous
base current, iB, and the net instantaneous collector current, i C.
