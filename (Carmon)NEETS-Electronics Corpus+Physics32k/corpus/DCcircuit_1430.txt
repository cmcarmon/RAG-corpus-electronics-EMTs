Change = - 1.4989 mA
Note that the ﬁgure obtained for change is negative, not positive! This tells us that current
has decreased rather than increased with the passage of time. Since we started at a current
of 1.5 mA, this decrease (-1.4989 mA) means that we have 0.001065 mA (1.065 µA) after 7.25
seconds.
