Folio 4 contains nine diagrams and a page of text on gravity and its effect on different shapes connected together on a balance. The back page of this folio has Leonardo's first reference to birds and his explanation on how they fly.
Leonardo writes a lengthy amount of text about two weights that each weigh three pounds that are connected together on either side of a balance. The slopes that each object rests on are at different angles, however. Leonardo goes on to write that, because of the slopes, one weight may weigh three pounds, but it is only providing two pounds of force. The other weight, also three pounds, is similarly stated to only provide one pound of force because it is resting on a smaller incline. Later on this page, he writes on the forces a balance experiences depending on the location of weights on the balance. The first reference to pressure for this codex is made towards the end of this folio, relating it to the working of a balance.
The first commentary on birds, for this codex, are made on the second page of the fourth folio. Leonardo describes how the tips of a bird's feathers are always the highest part of the bird, when its wings are lowered, and how the bones in the wing are the highest part of a bird when its wings are raised. He writes on the heaviest part of a body being the location that guides movement for that body. He also questions what part of the wing of a bird experiences the greatest amount of air pressure. To end this folio, Leonardo states how an object, "that does not bend under the pressure of objects of different sizes and weights", will distribute its weight to its supporting points that surround the center of the object.
