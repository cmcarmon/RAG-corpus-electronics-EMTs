The TTL family is large and widely used. TTL circuits can switch fairly quickly allowing
data rates on the order of 10 to 40 Mbits/s (mega stands for 220). They also have good output
current capability. However, they consume too much power and space to be used in LSI. Hence,
TTL is used primarily in SSI and MSI, which are the less densely packed ICs. MOS (metal-oxide
semiconductor) technology, which has low power consumption and high packing density, but low
output current capability, is widely used in LSI.
