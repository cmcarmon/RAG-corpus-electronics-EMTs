together,  they  reduce  to  an  expression  containing 
only one variable. 
 
It  is  also  important  to  note  that  the  map  is  a 
continuous surface  which links edge to edge. This 
allows  cells  at  opposite  extremes  of  a  row  or 
column to be linked together. The four corner cells 
of a  four (or  more)  variable  map  may likewise be 
grouped together (provided they all contain 1â€™s). 
  As an example, consider the following Boolean 
function: 
b
g
A B C
+
