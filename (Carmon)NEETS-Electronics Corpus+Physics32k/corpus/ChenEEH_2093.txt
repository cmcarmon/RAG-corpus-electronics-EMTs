. TC is a function that annotates transitions with Boolean
expressions. A super transition is an abstraction of low-
level actions, and its meaning is thus completely deﬁned
by the low-level reﬁnement. Therefore, the constraint of a
super transition is true by default (it is conceivable that a
nontrivial constraint for a super transition might be
useful; however, in general it is very difﬁcult to deﬁne
such a constraint and also very difﬁcult to interpret the
constraint with regard to the operational (dynamic) se-
mantics of the super transition).
. M0 is the initial marking function.
. r: P [ T ! P(P [ T ) is a hierarchical mapping that de-
ﬁnes the hierarchical relationships among the nodes in P
and T; this mapping also satisﬁes the constraint that
the interface nodes 2 IN [ OUT be all predicates if
their parent node is a predicate or all transitions if
their parent node is a transition. For any node n, r(n)
deﬁnes the immediate descendant nodes of n. The ances-
tor and descendants of any node can be easily expressed
by using well-known relations, such as transitive closure
on r. A node in an HPrTN is local to its parent and can
be uniquely identiﬁed by preﬁxing its ancesters’ names
separated with periods to its own name; however, often
its own name is referred whenever a no name clash
occurs.
