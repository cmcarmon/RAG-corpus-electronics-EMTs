Assume the following values for an Earth centred Kepler orbit
r1 = 10000 km
r2 = 16000 km
α = 100°
These are the numerical values that correspond to figures 1, 2, and 3.
Selecting the parameter y as 30000 km one gets a transfer time of 3072 seconds assuming the gravitational constant to be



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }
= 398603 km3/s2. Corresponding orbital elements are
semi-major axis = 23001 km
eccentricity = 0.566613
true anomaly at time t1 = −7.577°
true anomaly at time t2 = 92.423°
This y-value corresponds to Figure 3.
With
r1 = 10000 km
r2 = 16000 km
α = 260°
one gets the same ellipse with the opposite direction of motion, i.e.
true anomaly at time t1 = 7.577°
true anomaly at time t2 = 267.577° = 360° − 92.423°
and a transfer time of 31645 seconds.
The radial and tangential velocity components can then be computed with the formulas (see the Kepler orbit article)
