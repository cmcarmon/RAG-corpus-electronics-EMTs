Since we assume that the interconnections between the elements in a circuit
are perfect (i.e., the wires are ideal), then it is not necessary for a set of elements
to be joined together at a single point in space for their interconnection to be
considered a single node. An example of this is shown in Figure 2.3. While
the four elements in the figure are connected together, their connection does
not occur at a single point in space. Rather,
it is a distributed connection.
