LOW-NOISE AMPLIFIERS, sometimes called PREAMPS, are found in most modern radar
receivers. As previously mentioned, these amplifiers are usually solid-state microwave amplifiers. The
most common types are tunnel diode and parametric amplifiers. These amplifiers are discussed in detail in
NEETS, Module 11, Microwave Principles. Some older systems may still use a traveling-wave tube (twt)
as a low-noise first stage amplifier. However, the solid-state amplifiers produce lower noise levels and
more gain.
