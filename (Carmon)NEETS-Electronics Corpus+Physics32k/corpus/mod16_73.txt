â€¢ All measurement/stimulus circuits are monitored during use by calibrated instruments or are
dependent on external known or calibrated sources for performance within required limits. (When
determining that an instrument falls into the CALIBRATION NOT REQUIRED category, you
should annotate the label as to the authority for the decision, such as METRL, technical manual,
letter or message from higher authority.)
