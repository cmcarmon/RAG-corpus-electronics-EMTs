where θV is the angle associated with ¯V (with respect to any chosen reference), θI is the angle
associated with ¯I (with respect to the same reference chosen), θZ is the impedance angle, ¯V is
the rms voltage phasor, ¯I is the rms current phasor, and ¯Z = R ± j X is the complex impedance
stands for complex conjugate. If the voltage phasor ¯V itself is
with a magnitude of Z. Note that
taken to be the reference, θV = 0 and θI may be replaced by θ without any subscript.
