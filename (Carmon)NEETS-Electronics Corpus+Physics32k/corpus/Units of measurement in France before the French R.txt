According to the law of 19 Frimaire An VIII (December 10, 1799),
The kilogramme is equal to 18,827.15 grains. The kilogramme is, in addition, defined as the weight of 1 dm3 of distilled water at 4 degrees centigrade, i.e. at maximum density.
Traditionally, the French pound (livre) was defined as the mass of exactly ​1⁄70 of a French cubic foot of water. When the kilogram was defined, the knowledge that a pied du Roi cube filled with water masses exactly 70 French pounds was apparently lost. According to the traditional (cubic foot) definition, one livre would have been about 489.675  grams. According to the kilogramme definition, one livre was about 489.506 grammes. The difference is about 0.035%. However, a small difference in salinity (i.e. the difference between distilled water and very good quality drinking water) is enough to explain this difference.
The units in the following table are (except for the talent) calculated based on the kilogram definition of the livre.
