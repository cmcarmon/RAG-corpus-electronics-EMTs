The basic purpose of the SCR is to function as a switch that can turn on or off small or large amounts 
of power. It performs this function with no moving parts that wear out and no points that require 
replacing. There can be a tremendous power gain in the SCR; in some units a very small triggering 
current is able to switch several hundred amperes without exceeding its rated abilities. The SCR can often 
replace much slower and larger mechanical switches. It even has many advantages over its more complex 
and larger electron tube equivalent, the thyratron.
