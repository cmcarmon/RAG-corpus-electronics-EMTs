Figure 2.45 shows the possible resistor combinations that use up to three resistors.
To determine their equivalent resistance, use the parallel combination result from
W W W Equation 2.109 and the series combination result from Equation 2.67. This yields
equivalent resistances of: (A) 1000 , (B) 500 , (C) 2000 , (D) 333 , (E) 667 ,
(F) 1500 , and (G) 3000 .
