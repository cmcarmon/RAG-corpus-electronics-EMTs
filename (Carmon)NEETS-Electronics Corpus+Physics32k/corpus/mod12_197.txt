At T7, the two sideband frequencies are in phase with each other but 180 degrees out of phase with 
the carrier. This causes the combined sideband voltage to cancel the carrier voltage, and the modulation 
envelope becomes 0 at that instant. Note that for the transmitter output to be 0 at T7, both the carrier and 
sideband frequencies must be present. If any one of these three frequencies were missing, complete 
cancellation would not occur and rf energy would be present in the output.
