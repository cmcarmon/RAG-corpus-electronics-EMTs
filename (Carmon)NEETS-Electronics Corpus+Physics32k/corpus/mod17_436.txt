Many complex electronic systems are installed aboard Navy ships. In modern ships, complex 
systems with higher power and greater sensitivity are being crowded into a restricted and corrosive area. 
Figure 3-34 is a Spruance class destroyer with its crowded (compact) communications environment. The 
ability of these systems to perform their individual functions without interference is known as 
ELECTROMAGNETIC COMPATIBILITY (emc). Emc is concerned with the structure of the ship and 
its electrical and electronic system. Compact environment is a major limitation to the effectiveness of a 
total ship system concept.
