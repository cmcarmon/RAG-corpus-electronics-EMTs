Note: While it has become common to find the term moment of inertia used to describe the polar and planar second moments of area, this is primarily a construct of engineering fields. The term moment of inertia, within physics and mathematics fields, is strictly the mass moment of inertia, or second moment of mass, used to describe a massive object's resistance to rotational motion, not its resistance to torsional deformation. While the polar and planar second moments of inertia are integrated over all the infinitesimal elements of a given area in some two-dimensional cross-section, the mass moment of inertia is integrated over all the infinitesimal elements of mass in a three-dimensional space occupied by an object. Simply put, the polar and planar second moments of inertia are an indication of rigidity, and the mass moment of inertia is the rotational motion resistance of a massive object.
The equation describing the polar moment of inertia is a multiple integral over the cross-sectional area,



A


{\displaystyle A}
, of the object.

Where,

Substituting the

It is shown that the polar moment of inertia can be described as the summation of the

This is also shown in the perpendicular axis theorem. For objects that have rotational symmetry, such as a cylinder or hollow tube, the equation can be simplified to:
