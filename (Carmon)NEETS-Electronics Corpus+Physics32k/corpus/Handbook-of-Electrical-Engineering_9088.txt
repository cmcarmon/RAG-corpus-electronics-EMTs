The very important questions are: did such a status quo change? Where? And why?
Depending on the region of the world, smart cards replaced magnetic-stripe cards more or less successfully.
In Europe, you could hardly ﬁnd a single magnetic stripe card in use, while in America, intelligent chip cards
(ICC) still experience their childhood. The reason for such a worldly footprint of ICC technology is due to the
market’s demand for security measures as well as for diverse functionality. Last, but not least, the costs of on-
line  telecommunication  services  should  be  mentioned.  Magnetic  stripe  offers  about  140  bytes  of  available
memory, almost nonexistent security, and in most cases, requires costly on-line service while ICC may be used
in both on- and off-line environments, grants a very high, sophisticated level of secure operation and, ﬁnally,
allows multifunctionality.
