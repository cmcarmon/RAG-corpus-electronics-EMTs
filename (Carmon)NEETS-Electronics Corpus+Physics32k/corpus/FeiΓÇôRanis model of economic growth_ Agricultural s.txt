In (A), land is measured on the vertical axis, and labor on the horizontal axis. Ou and Ov represent two ridge lines, and the production contour lines are depicted by M, M1 and M2. The area enclosed by the ridge lines defines the region of factor substitutability, or the region where factors can easily be substituted. Let us understand the repercussions of this. If te amount of labor is the total labor in the agricultural sector, the intersection of the ridge line Ov with the production curve M1 at point s renders M1 perfectly horizontal below Ov. The horizontal behavior of the production line implies that outside the region of factor substitutability, output stops and labor becomes redundant once land is fixed and labor is increased.
If Ot is the total land in the agricultural sector, ts amount of labor can be employed without it becoming redundant, and es represents the redundant agricultural labor force. This led Fei and Ranis to develop the concept of Labor Utilization Ratio, which they define as the units of labor that can be productively employed (without redundancy) per unit of land. In the left-side figure, labor utilization ratio




R
=



t
s


O
t





{\displaystyle R={\frac {ts}{Ot}}}


which is graphically equal to the inverted slope of the ridge line Ov.
Fei and Ranis also built the concept of endowment ratio, which is a measure of the relative availability of the two factors of production. In the figure, if Ot represents agricultural land and tE represents agricultural labor, then the endowment ratio is given by




S
=



t
E


O
t





{\displaystyle S={\frac {tE}{Ot}}}


which is equal to the inverted slope of OE. The actual point of endowment is given by E.
Finally, Fei and Ranis developed the concept of non-redundancy coefficient T which is measured by




T
=



t
s


t
e





{\displaystyle T={\frac {ts}{te}}}


These three concepts helped them in formulating a relationship between T, R and S. If ::



T
=



t
s


t
e



,


{\displaystyle T={\frac {ts}{te}},}
then




T

or

T

{\displaystyle T={\frac {ts/Ot}{te/Ot}}={\frac {R}{S}},{\text{ or }}T={\frac {R}{S}}\,}


This mathematical relation proves that the non-redundancy coefficient is directly proportional to labor utilization ratio and is inversely proportional to the endowment ratio.
(B) displays the total physical productivity of labor (TPPL) curve. The curve increases at a decreasing rate, as more units of labor are added to a fixed amount of land. At point N, the curve shapes horizontally and this point N conforms to the point G in (C, which shows the marginal productivity of labor (MPPL) curve, and with point s on the ridge line Ov in (A).
