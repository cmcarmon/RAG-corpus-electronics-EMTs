INTERNAL SHUNTS FOR METERS IN THE 0- TO 50-AMPERE RANGE.â€”When
measuring current ranges below 50 amperes, you will most often use internal shunts (Rshunt). In this way,
you can easily change the range of the meter by means of a switching arrangement. A switch will select
the correct internal shunt with the necessary current rating and resistance. Before you can calculate the
required resistance of the shunt for each range, the total resistance of the meter movement must be
known. For example, suppose you desire to use a 100-microampere D'Arsonval meter with an internal
coil resistance of 100 ohms to measure line currents up to 1 ampere. The meter will deflect to its full-scale
position when the current through the deflection coil is 100 microamperes.
