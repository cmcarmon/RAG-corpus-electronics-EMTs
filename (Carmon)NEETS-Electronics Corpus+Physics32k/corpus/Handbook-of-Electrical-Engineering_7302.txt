In addition, another CDMA standard known as Wideband CDMA (W-CDMA) is under development in Europe
and  Japan. Although  this  standard  is  a  CDMA  standard,  it  is  not  backwards-compatible  with  IS-95,  and  is  not
designed in such a way that W-CDMA equipment can be used interchangeably with 3rd generation IS-95 equipment.
The  development  of  3rd  generation  systems  is  ongoing,  with  equipment  deployment  forecast  for  the  ﬁrst
part of the new millennium. Much work remains to be done before these standards can solidify sufﬁciently for
equipment development and deployment to be completed.
