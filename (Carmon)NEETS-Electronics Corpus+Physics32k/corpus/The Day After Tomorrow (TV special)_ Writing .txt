By 1975, Group Three Productions had received no assurance from its distributor, ITC Entertainment, that a second series of Space: 1999 would be commissioned. With the possibility of cancellation looming, Anderson and his scriptwriter, Space: 1999 script editor Johnny Byrne, conceived the special that would become The Day After Tomorrow as the pilot episode of a prospective new series. If successful, the pilot, titled "Into Infinity", would be followed by additional episodes – the series itself to be named The Day After Tomorrow. Ultimately, Anderson was unsuccessful in securing the funding needed to make a full series, and The Day After Tomorrow: "Into Infinity" remains a self-contained science-fiction drama.
In preparation for his work on the special, Anderson researched Einstein's achievements; in his authorised biography, he admitted that he did not understand any of the physicist's theories. Byrne's script directed that E=mc2 – the Einsteinian formula that relates mass to energy – appear on-screen at intervals. Of the ending, it commented that, "it's a universe not only stranger than we imagine, but stranger than we can imagine." Although special relativity provides the main scientific and educational focus of the programme, The Day After Tomorrow also examines time dilation – an effect whereby time decelerates at a rate proportional to that of the acceleration of an object. For the crew of Altares, a ship capable of travelling at the speed of light, the mission to Alpha Centauri is measured in years, while whole decades pass on Earth. To encourage children to explore the topics in their own time (and thereby develop their research skills), Byrne wrote the characters in such a way that they provide only partial explanations of special relativity and related subjects.
