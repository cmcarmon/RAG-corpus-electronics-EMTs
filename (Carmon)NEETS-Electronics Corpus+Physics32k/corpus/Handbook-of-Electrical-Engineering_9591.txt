instruction  is  either  a  local  type  instruction,  where  it  is  executed  entirely  within  the  CU,  or  it  is  a  parallel
instruction  and  is  executed  in  the  processing  array.  The  primary  function  of  the  CU  is  to  examine  each
instruction as it is to be executed and to determine where the execution should take place.
