Figure 1-12 shows a transformer-coupling network between two stages of amplification. The 
transformer action of T1 couples the signal from the first stage to the second stage. In figure 1-12, the 
primary of T1 acts as the load for the first stage (Q1) and the secondary of T1 acts as the developing 
impedance for the second stage (Q2). No capacitor is needed because transformer action couples the 
signal between the primary and secondary of T1.
