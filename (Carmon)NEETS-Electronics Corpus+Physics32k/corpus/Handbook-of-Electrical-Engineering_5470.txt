Principles of Converter Operation
Converter Circuit
Since the generation and most of the transmission and utilization is alternating current, HVDC transmission
requires conversion from ac to dc (called rectiÔ¨Åcation) at the sending end and conversion back from dc to ac
(called inversion) at the receiving end. In HVDC transmission, the basic device used for conversion from ac
to dc and from dc to ac is a three-phase full-wave bridge converter, which is also known as a Graetz circuit.
This is a three-phase six-pulse converter. A three-phase twelve-pulse converter will be composed of two three-
phase  six-pulse  converters,  supplied  with  voltages  differing  in  phase  by  30  degrees  (Fig. 61.13).  The  phase
difference of 30 degrees is obtained by supplying one six-pulse bridge with a Y/Y transformer and the other by
Y/D transformer.
Relationships between AC and DC Quantities
Voltages  and  currents  on  ac  and  dc  sides  of  the  converter  are  related  and  are  functions  of  several  converter
parameters including the converter transformer. The following equations are provided here for easy reference.
Detailed derivations are given in Kimbark [1971].
