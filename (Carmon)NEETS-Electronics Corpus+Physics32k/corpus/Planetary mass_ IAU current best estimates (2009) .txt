A new set of "current best estimates" for various astronomical constants was approved the 27th General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in August 2009. It includes masses for all the planets except the Earth–Moon system, as well as Eris, Pluto, Ceres, Vesta and Pallas: values for the masses of Eris, Pluto, Ceres, Vesta and Pallas are as given in the table above. Except for those of Mercury and Uranus, all the planetary masses have been revised since the DE405 ephemeris (1998).
The ratio of the mass of the Moon to the mass of the Earth is given as 1.23000371(4)×10−2, while the ratio of the mass of the Sun to the mass of the Earth can be calculated as the ratio of the heliocentric and geocentric gravitational constants: 332.9460487(7)×103, giving the mass of the Earth as 3.003486962(6)×10−6 M☉ or 5.9722(6)×1024 kg.
