The basic equation of peridynamics is the following equation of motion:

{\displaystyle \rho (x){\ddot {u}}(x,t)=\int _{R}f(u(x',t)-u(x,t),x'-x,x)dV_{x'}+b(x,t)}

where



x


{\displaystyle x}
is a point in a body



R


{\displaystyle R}
,



t


{\displaystyle t}
is time,



u


{\displaystyle u}
is the displacement vector field, and



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
is the mass density in the undeformed body.




x
′



{\displaystyle x'}
is a dummy variable of integration.
The vector valued function



f


{\displaystyle f}
is the force density that




x
′



{\displaystyle x'}
exerts on



x


{\displaystyle x}
. This force density depends on the relative displacement and relative position vectors between




x
′



{\displaystyle x'}
and



x


{\displaystyle x}
. The dimensions of



f


{\displaystyle f}
are force per volume squared. The function



f


{\displaystyle f}
is called the "pairwise force function" and contains all the constitutive (material-dependent) properties. It describes how the internal forces depend on the deformation.
The interaction between any



x


{\displaystyle x}
and




x
′



{\displaystyle x'}
is called a "bond." The physical mechanism in this interaction need not be specified. It is usually assumed that



f


{\displaystyle f}
vanishes whenever




x
′



{\displaystyle x'}
is outside a neighborhood of



x


{\displaystyle x}
(in the undeformed configuration) called the horizon.

The term "peridynamic," an adjective, was proposed in the year 2000 and comes from the prefix peri, which means all around, near, or surrounding; and the root dyna, which means force or power. The term "peridynamics," a noun, is a shortened form of the phrase peridynamic model of solid mechanics.
