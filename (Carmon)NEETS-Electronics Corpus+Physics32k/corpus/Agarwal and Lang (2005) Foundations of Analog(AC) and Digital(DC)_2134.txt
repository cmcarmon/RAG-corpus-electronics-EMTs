between the input and the output parts of the circuit,
in the sense that the
output resistor RL can be changed by many orders of magnitude, with a corre-
sponding orders-of-magnitude change in output current, but the output voltage
and the input current will be virtually unchanged. This isolation is referred to as
buffering.
