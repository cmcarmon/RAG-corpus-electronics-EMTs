Linear Transversal Equalizers
Among the many structures used for equalization, the simplest is the transversal (tapped delay line or nonre-
cursive) equalizer shown in Fig. 70.6. In such an equalizer the current and past values r(t – nT) of the received
signal are linearly weighted by equalizer coefﬁcients (tap gains) cn and summed to produce the output. In the
commonly used digital implementation, samples of the received signal at the symbol rate are stored in a digital
shift register (or memory), and the equalizer output samples (sums of products) z(t0 + kT) or zk are computed
digitally, once per symbol, according to
