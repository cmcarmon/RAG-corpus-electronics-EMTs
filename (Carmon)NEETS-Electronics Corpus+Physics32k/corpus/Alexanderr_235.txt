We  begin  by  discussing  the  ideal  op  amp  and  later  consider  the
nonideal op amp. Using nodal analysis as a tool, we consider ideal op
amp  circuits  such  as  the  inverter,  voltage  follower,  summer,  and  dif-
ference  ampliﬁer.  We  will  also  analyze  op  amp  circuits  with  PSpice.
Finally, we learn how an op amp is used in digital-to-analog convert-
ers and instrumentation ampliﬁers.
