MEMS pressure sensors cover a wide range of pressures and
have very diverse applications. Commercial parts can measure
pressures from about 1% of one atmosphere to over one
thousand atmospheres. Figure 6.10 shows a variety of devices
from one of several manufacturers. Two major areas of
application are in the automotive and medical
industries.
MEMS pressure sensors are employed for measurement of
the air pressure in engine manifolds, oil and fuel pressures,
and the pressure in tires. Medical uses include the measure-
ment of blood pressure. Medical applications are based on the
fact that MEMS pressure sensors can be made cheaply and
discarded after use to avoid contamination. Such measure-
ments can be done on catheters inserted into the body because
of the small size of the sensors or outside of the body when a
needle and tube permit access to the internal blood pressure.
Because MEMS pressure sensors are catalog items, they are
available for a wide variety of uses, many of them well beyond
the initially envisioned applications. They can be found in
