11.2.4 For the magnetic circuit shown in Figure P11.2.4,
neglecting leakage and fringing, determine the
mmf of the exciting coil required to produce a
ï¬‚ux density of 1.6 T in the air gap. The material is
M-19. The dimensions are lm1 = 60 cm, Am1 =
24 cm2, lm2 = 10 cm, Am2 = 16 cm2, lg = 0.1
cm, and Ag = 16 cm2.
