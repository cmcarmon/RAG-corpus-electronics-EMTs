demultiplexing tasks in ultrahigh-speed photonic integrated
circuits. Figure 9.18 is a scanning electron microscope image
of a portion of a prototype photonic circuit comprised of 5.0-
mm diameter aluminum gallium arsenide (AlGaAs) microcav-
ity disk resonators coupled to 0.3-mm wide optical waveguides
across air gaps spanning 0.1 to 0:3 mm.
