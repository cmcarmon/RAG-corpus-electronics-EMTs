Another extremely useful device for troubleshooting logic circuits is the logic pulser. It is similar in
shape to the logic probe and is designed to inject a logic pulse into the circuit under test. Logic pursers are
generally used in conjunction with a logic clip or a logic probe to help you trace the pulse through the
circuit under test or verify the proper operation of an IC. Some logic pursers have a feature that allows a
single pulse injection or a train of pulses. Logic pursers are usually powered by an external dc power
supply but may, in some cases, be connected directly to the power supply of the device under test. View
A of figure 2-27 shows a typical logic pulser. View B shows a logic pulser (right) used with a logic probe
(left).
