Understanding signal generation and how systems work amounts to understanding signals, the nature
of the information they represent, how information is transformed between analog and digital forms, and
how information can be processed by systems operating on information-bearing signals. This understanding
demands two diﬀerent ﬁelds of knowledge. One is electrical science: How are signals represented and ma-
nipulated electrically? The second is signal science: What is the structure of signals, no matter what their
source, what is their information content, and what capabilities does this structure force upon communication
systems?

The most ubiquitous and important signal in electrical engineering is the sinusoid.
