The IEEE Standard Dictionary of Electrical and Electronics Terms deﬁnes 
 in stable, linear
systems to be “the frequency-dependent relation in both gain and phase difference between steady-state sinu-
soidal inputs and the resultant steady-state sinusoidal outputs” [IEEE, 1988]. In certain specialized applications,
the term 
 may be used with more restrictive meanings. However, all such uses can be related
back to the fundamental deﬁnition. The frequency response characteristics of a system can be found directly
from its transfer function. A single-input/single-output linear time-invariant system is shown in Fig. 11.1.
