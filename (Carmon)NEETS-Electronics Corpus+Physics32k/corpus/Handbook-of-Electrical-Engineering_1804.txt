In general, the optical ﬂow has been found difﬁcult to compute because of the algorithm sensitivity to noise.
Also, the estimates may not be accurate at scene discontinuities. However, because of its importance in assigning
a velocity vector at each pixel, there continues to be research in the ﬁeld.
