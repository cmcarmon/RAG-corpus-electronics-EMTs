The choice of insulating material between the plates, as was mentioned before, has a great
impact upon how much ﬁeld ﬂux (and therefore how much charge) will develop with any given
amount of voltage applied across the plates. Because of the role of this insulating material in
affecting ﬁeld ﬂux, it has a special name: dielectric. Not all dielectric materials are equal: the
extent to which materials inhibit or encourage the formation of electric ﬁeld ﬂux is called the
permittivity of the dielectric.
