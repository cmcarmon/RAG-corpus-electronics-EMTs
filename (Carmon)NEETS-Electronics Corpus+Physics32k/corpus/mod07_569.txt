You already know how to check possible resistor troubles. Just use an ohmmeter after making sure 
no parallel circuit is connected across the resistor you wish to measure. When you know a parallel circuit 
is connected across the resistor or when you are in doubt disconnect one end of the resistor before 
measuring it. The ohmmeter check will usually be adequate. However, never forget that occasionally 
intermittent troubles may develop in resistors as well as in any other electronic parts.
