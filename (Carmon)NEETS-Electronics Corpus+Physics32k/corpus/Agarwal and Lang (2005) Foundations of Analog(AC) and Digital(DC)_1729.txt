In contrast to the circuit behavior studied in Section 12.1, Equations 12.63
and 12.64 are characterized by two important rates, or frequencies. The first
frequency is ωd, which determines the rate at which the states oscillate. The
second frequency is α, which determines the rate at which the states decay. As a
consequence, another important characteristic of the circuit behavior described
by Equations 12.63 and 12.64 is the relative size of α with respect to ω◦. This
is usually expressed in terms of the Quality Factor Q of the circuit defined by
