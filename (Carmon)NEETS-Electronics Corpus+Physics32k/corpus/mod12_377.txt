The pcm demodulator will reproduce the correct standard amplitude represented by the pulse-code
group. However, it will reproduce the correct standard only if it is able to recognize correctly the presence
or absence of pulses in each position. For this reason, noise introduces no error at all if the signal-to-noise
ration is such that the largest peaks of noise are not mistaken for pulses. When the noise is random (circuit
and tube noise), the probability of the appearance of a noise peak comparable in amplitude to the pulses
can be determined. This probability can be determined mathematically for any ration of signal-to-average-
noise power. When this is done for 10 5 pulses per second, the approximate error rate for three values of
signal power to average noise power is:
