The system consists of two primary bodies with the same mass

{\displaystyle \left(m_{1}=m_{2}={\tfrac {m}{2}}\right)}
, which move in circular or elliptical Kepler orbits around their center of mass. The third body, which is substantially smaller than the primary bodies and whose mass can be set to zero

, moves under the influence of the primary bodies in a plane that is perpendicular to the orbital plane of the primary bodies (see Figure 1). The origin of the system is at the focus of the primary bodies. The combined mass of the primary bodies
