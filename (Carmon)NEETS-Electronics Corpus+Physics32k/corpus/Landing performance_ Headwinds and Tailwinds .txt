The headwind reduces the landing distance for an aircraft. Landing into a headwind reduces the Ground Speed (GS) for the same TAS. This is beneficial to pilots as well as Air traffic controllers (ATC). An aircraft landing into a headwind will require less runway and will be able to vacate the runway sooner. If the headwind decreases near the ground, there's a decrease in the performance of the aircraft and it will tend to sink and possibly under shoot the aiming point. Tailwind increases the Ground Speed of an aircraft for the same TAS and thus a longer runway distance will be required for an aircraft to land. Landing in a tailwind situation could lead to the aircraft over shooting the runway and colliding with objects or terrain.
