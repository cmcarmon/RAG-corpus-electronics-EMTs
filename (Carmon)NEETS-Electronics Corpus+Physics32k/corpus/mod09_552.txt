Figure 4-18, view (A), illustrates the circuit of a positive-diode clamper. Resistor R1 provides a 
discharge path for C1. This resistance is large in value so that the discharge time of C1 will be long 
compared to the input pulse width. The diode provides a fast charge path for C1. After C1 becomes 
charged it acts as a voltage source. The input wave shape shown in view (B) is a square wave and varies 
between +25 volts and âˆ’25 volts. Compare each portion of the input wave shape with the corresponding 
output wave shape. Keep Kirchhoff's law in mind: The algebraic sum of the voltage drops around a closed 
loop is 0 at any instant.
