Data is a general term used to describe raw facts. To put it simply, data is nothing more than a 
collection of related elements or items, that when properly coded into some type of input medium, can be 
processed by a computer. Data items might include your service number, your name, your paygrade, or 
any other fact. Until some meaning has been given to the data, nothing can really be determined about it; 
therefore, it remains data. When this data has been processed together with other facts, it then has 
meaning and it becomes information we can understand and properly use.
