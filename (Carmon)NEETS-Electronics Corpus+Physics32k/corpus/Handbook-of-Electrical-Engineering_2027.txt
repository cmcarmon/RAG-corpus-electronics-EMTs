FIGURE  19.3 Peak  third-octave  band  levels  of  normal  to
loud speech (hatched) and typical levels/dominant frequen-
cies of speech sounds (identiﬁers). Both can be compared to
the  third-octave  threshold  of  normal-hearing  people  (solid
line),  thresholds  for  a  mildly  hearing-impaired  person  (A),
for  a  severely  hearing-impaired  person  (B),  and  for  a  pro-
foundly hearing-impaired person (C). For example, for per-
son  (A),  sibilants  and  some  weak  consonants  in  a  normal
conversation cannot be perceived. (Source: H. Levitt, “Speech
