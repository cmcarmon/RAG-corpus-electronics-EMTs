Problem 5.31: Stock Market Data Processing
Because a trading week lasts ﬁve days, stock markets frequently compute running averages each day over the
previous ﬁve trading days to smooth price ﬂuctuations. The technical stock analyst at the Buy-Lo–Sell-Hi
brokerage ﬁrm has heard that FFT ﬁltering techniques work better than any others (in terms of producing
more accurate averages).
(a) What is the diﬀerence equation governing the ﬁve-day averager for daily stock prices?
(b) Design an eﬃcient FFT-based ﬁltering algorithm for the broker. How much data should be processed
