Various combinations of the driving force and moving phase determine various electrokinetic effects. According to J.Lyklema, the complete family of electrokinetic phenomena includes:
electrophoresis, as motion of particles under influence of electric field;
electro-osmosis, as motion of liquid in porous body under influence of electric field;
diffusiophoresis, as motion of particles under influence of a chemical potential gradient;
capillary osmosis, as motion of liquid in porous body under influence of the chemical potential gradient;
sedimentation potential, as electric field generated by sedimenting colloid particles;
streaming potential/current, as either electric potential or current generated by fluid moving through porous body, or relative to flat surface;
colloid vibration current, as electric current generated by particles moving in fluid under influence of ultrasound;
electric sonic amplitude, as ultrasound generated by colloidal particles in oscillating electric field.
