Dual-clutch transmissions use two fundamentally different types of clutches: either two wet multiplate clutches, bathed in oil (for cooling), or two dry single-plate clutches. The wet clutch design is generally used for higher torque engines that can generate 350 newton metres (258 lbf⋅ft) and more (the wet multiplate clutch DCT in the Bugatti Veyron is designed to cope with 1,250 N⋅m (922 lbf⋅ft)), whereas the dry-clutch design is generally suitable for smaller vehicles with lower torque outputs up to 250 N⋅m (184 lbf⋅ft). However, while the dry-clutch variants may be limited in torque compared to their wet-clutch counterparts, the dry-clutch versions offer an increase in fuel efficiency, due to the lack of pumping losses of the transmission fluid in the clutch housing.
