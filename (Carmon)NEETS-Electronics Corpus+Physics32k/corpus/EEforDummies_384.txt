In one position (labeled charge in Figure 7‐3), this changeover switch will 
connect the 9 V battery to the circuit, allowing the capacitor to charge 
up. In the other position (labeled discharge in Figure 7‐3), the switch will 
disconnect the battery and replace it with a wire, so that the capacitor 
can discharge.
