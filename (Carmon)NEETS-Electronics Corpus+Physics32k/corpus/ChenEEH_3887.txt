this case, for each unique combination of regions, the image is
cropped to include only those selected regions, and the
cropped image is then rescaled to ﬁt the device screen size.
Then, the regions are evaluated in terms of the image’s content
value under the rescaling and selection, and the total content
value is computed. Then, the combination of regions with
maximum beneﬁt is selected as the optimal transcoding of
the image. The complexity of this search is not great consider-
ing that each image will typically only have a handful of
annotated regions.
