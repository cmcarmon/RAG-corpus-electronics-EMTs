Coil a is connected in series with R3 and unknown resistance Rx. The combination of coil a, R3, and
Rx forms a direct series path between the + and -  brushes of the dc generator. Coil b is connected in series
with R2, and this combination is also connected across the generator. Notice that the movable member
(pointer) of the instrument portion of the megger has no restoring springs. Therefore, when the generator
is not being operated, the pointer will float freely and may come to rest at any position on the scale.
