The most complex mapping systems observe their surroundings, usually by digitized video, and create their
own map of the surrounding terrain. Guidance software then steers the vehicle. In 1997, such systems were in
development  for  hazardous  sites  such  as  nuclear  plants,  waste-disposal  facilities,  and  battleÔ¨Åelds,  and  for
unmanned planetary exploration.
