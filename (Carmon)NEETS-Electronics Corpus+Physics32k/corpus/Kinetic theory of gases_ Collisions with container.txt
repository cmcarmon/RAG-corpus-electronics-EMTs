One can calculate the number of atomic or molecular collisions with a wall of a container per unit area per unit time.
Assuming an ideal gas, a derivation results in an equation for total number of collisions per unit time per area:

.


{\displaystyle N^{*}={\frac {1}{4}}{\frac {N}{V}}v_{\text{avg}}={\frac {n}{4}}{\sqrt {\frac {8k_{B}T}{\pi m}}}.}

This quantity is also known as the "impingement rate" in vacuum physics.
