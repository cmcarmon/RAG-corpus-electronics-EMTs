For definiteness consider a circular earth orbit (helical world line) of a particle. The particle travels with speed v. An observer on earth sees that length is contracted in the frame of the particle. A measuring stick traveling with the particle appears shorter to the earth observer. Therefore, the circumference of the orbit, which is in the direction of motion appears longer than



π


{\displaystyle \pi }
times the diameter of the orbit.
In special relativity the 4-proper-velocity of the particle in the inertial (non-accelerating) frame of the earth is




u
=

(

)



{\displaystyle u=\left(\gamma ,\gamma {\mathbf {v}  \over c}\right)}

where c is the speed of light,




v



{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} }
is the 3-velocity, and

{\displaystyle \gamma }
is

{\displaystyle \gamma ={1 \over {\sqrt {1-{{\mathbf {v} \cdot \mathbf {v} } \over c^{2}}}}}}
.
The magnitude of the 4-velocity vector is always constant

.
The magnitude of the 4-velocity is therefore a Lorentz scalar.
The 4-acceleration in the earth (non-accelerating) frame is

where



d

{\displaystyle d\tau }

where



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }
is the angular velocity of the rotating particle and




r



{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }
is the 3-position of the particle.
The magnitude of the 4-velocity is constant. This implies that the 4-acceleration must be perpendicular to the 4-velocity. The inner product of the 4-acceleration and the 4-velocity is therefore always zero. The inner product is a Lorentz scalar.
