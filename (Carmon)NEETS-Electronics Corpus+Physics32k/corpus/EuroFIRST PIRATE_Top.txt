The EuroFirst Passive Infrared Airborne Track Equipment (PIRATE) is the Forward looking infrared(FLIR) / Infra-red search and track (IRST) for the Eurofighter Typhoon. It is produced by the EuroFIRST consortium consisting of Selex ES of Italy (lead contractor), THALES Land & Joint Systems of the UK (system technical authority), and TECNOBIT of Spain. The system is mounted on the port side of the fuselage, forward of the windscreen and provides passive and thus undetectable and unjammable means of long range surveillance. In addition the system has been shown to locate stealth aircraft at a "significant distance" with further improvements in detection through software updates. This is due to the fact that the system measures changes in IR radiation against the background radiation. A stealth target that suppresses its heat radiation would thus appear as a "black hole" against the natural background, and would thus be better located. Also, supersonic flight heats up the skin of the aircraft as result of air friction.
