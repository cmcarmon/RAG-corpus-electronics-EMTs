52.3  Relation to the Electronic Structure — (i) vct << 1
General  expressions  for  R  in  terms  of  the  parameters  that  describe  the  electronic  structure  can  be  obtained
using  Eqs.  (52.7)–(52.10)  and  have  been  given  by  Blatt  [Blatt,  1957]  for  the  case  of  crystals  having  cubic
symmetry. An even more general treatment has been given by McClure [McClure, 1956]. Here the discussion
of speciﬁc results will be restricted to the free electron model wherein the material is assumed to have one or
more conducting bands, each of which has a quadratic dispersion relationship connecting  E  and k; that is
