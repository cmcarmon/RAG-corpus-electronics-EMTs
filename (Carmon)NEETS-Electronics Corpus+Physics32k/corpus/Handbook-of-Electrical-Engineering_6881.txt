where R is resistance (ohms), B is the frequency bandwidth of measurement in Hz (all emf ﬂuctuations outside
of B are ignored), PWW (B) is the mean power over B (see Eq. 73.21), and Boltzmann’s constant is k = 1.38 3
10–23  J/K  [see  Ott,  1988;  Gardner,  1990,  p.  288;  or  Peebles,  1987,  p.  227].  Under  external  emf,  the  thermally
induced collisions are the main source of resistance in conductors (electrons pulled into motion by an external
emf at 0K meet no resistance). The rms voltage is Wrms = s
