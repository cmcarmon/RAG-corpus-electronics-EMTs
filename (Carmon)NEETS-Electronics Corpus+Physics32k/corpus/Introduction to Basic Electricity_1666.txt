The more resistors connected in series, the more 
opposition there is to current flow. The more opposiâ€‘
tion there is to current flow, the higher the resistance 
in the circuit. In other words, when a resistor is added 
in series to a circuit, the total resistance in the circuit 
increases. The total resistance in a series circuit is the
