Measurement Models
The Kalman ﬁlter theory assumes Gaussian measurement errors that are statistically independent from sample
to sample, with zero mean and exactly known covariance matrix (Rk). However, in many practical applications,
these are poor approximations of reality. For example, in radar applications, the measurments of range, azimuth,
and  elevations  are  often  biased,  non-Gaussian,  and  correlated  with  time,  owing  to  diverse  physical  effects
including  multipath,  tropospheric  refraction,  ducting,  ionospheric  refraction,  glint,  RV  wake,  rocket  exhaust
plume, RFI, ECM, unresolved measurements, bias errors in time, location and angular orientation for the radar
itself, radar hardware errors, etc. Gauss himself cautioned against naïve least squares ﬁtting of data with bias
and drift; see Gauss [1995].
