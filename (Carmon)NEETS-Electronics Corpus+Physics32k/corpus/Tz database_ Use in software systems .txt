The tz database is used for time zone processing and conversions in many computer software systems, including:
BSD-derived systems, including FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFly BSD, and macOS (they also use the reference TZ database processing code as their TZ POSIX API implementation);
the GNU C Library and systems that use it, including GNU, most Linux distributions, BeOS, Haiku, Nexenta OS, and Cygwin;
System V Release 4-derived systems, such as Solaris and UnixWare;
AIX 6.1 and later (earlier versions of AIX, starting with AIX 5.2, include zoneinfo, for support of third-party applications such as MySQL, but do not use it themselves);
several other Unix systems, including Tru64, and UNICOS/mp (also IRIX, still maintained but no longer shipped);

The Olson timezone IDs are also used by the Unicode Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR) and International Components for Unicode (ICU). For example, the CLDR Windowsâ€“Tzid table maps Microsoft Windows time zone IDs to the standard Olson names.
