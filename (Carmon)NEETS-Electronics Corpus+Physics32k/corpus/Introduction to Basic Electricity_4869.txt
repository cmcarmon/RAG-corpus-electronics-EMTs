Compile the information collected and develop a 
spreadsheet. Remember, in developing a budget, some 
adjustments may have to be made. A budget should be 
a tool to be used, not a document to be created and 
then forgotten. By using a working budget, the budget 
will become more accurate over time, helping to make 
informed decisions.
