Compare part (A) of figure 3-41 with part (B) of the circuit in figure 3-40. Notice that doubling the
value of the second branch resistor (R2) has no effect on the current in the first branch (IR1), but does
reduce the second branch current (IR2) to one-half its original value. The total circuit current drops to a
value equal to the sum of the branch currents. These facts are verified by the following equations.
