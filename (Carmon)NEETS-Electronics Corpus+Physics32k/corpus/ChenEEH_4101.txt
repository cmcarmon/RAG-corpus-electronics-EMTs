In practical systems, the frequency response of the channel is
not known with sufﬁcient accuracy to allow for a receiver
design that will compensate for ISI for all time. The ﬁlter for
handling ISI at the receiver contains various parameters that
are adjusted on the basis of measurements of the channel
