Take the simplest meaningful example of the discrete case: a quantum system that can be in two possible states: for example, the polarization of a photon. When the polarization is measured, it could be the horizontal state | H ⟩, or the vertical state | V ⟩. Until its polarization is measured the photon can be in a superposition of both these states, so its state |ψ⟩ could be written as:





|

ψ
⟩
=
α

|

H
⟩
+
β

|

V
⟩
,



{\displaystyle |\psi \rangle =\alpha |H\rangle +\beta |V\rangle ,\,}

The probability amplitudes of |ψ⟩ for the states | H ⟩ and | V ⟩ are α and β respectively. When the photon's polarization is measured, the resulting state is either horizontal or vertical. But in a random experiment, the probability of being horizontally polarized is α2, and the probability of being vertically polarized is β2.
Therefore, a photon in a state

{\displaystyle |\psi \rangle ={\sqrt {1 \over 3}}|H\rangle -i{\sqrt {2 \over 3}}|V\rangle }
would have a probability of 1/3 to come out horizontally polarized, and a probability of 2/3 to come out vertically polarized when an ensemble of measurements are made. The order of such results, is, however, completely random.
