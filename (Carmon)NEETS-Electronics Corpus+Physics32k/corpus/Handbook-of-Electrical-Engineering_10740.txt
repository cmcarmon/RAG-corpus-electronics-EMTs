The  average “ﬂow” —  the  complete  cycle  of  refurbishing  an  orbiter —  requires  the  integration  of
approximately  10,000  work  events,  takes  65  days,  and  some  40,000  technician  labor  hours.  Under  the
best conditions, scheduling each of the 10,000 work events in a single ﬂow would be a task of monumental
proportions.  But  the  job  is  further  complicated  by  the  fact  that  only  half  the  work  is  standard  and
predictable; the other half is composed of problem-generated tasks and jobs speciﬁc to the next mission,
which creates a highly dynamic processing environment and requires frequent rescheduling.
