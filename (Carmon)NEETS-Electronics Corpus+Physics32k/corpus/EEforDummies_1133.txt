Because  the  nominal  value  of  the  resistor  is  
1 Ω, the current (in amps) through the resistor 
has roughly the same value as the voltage (in 
volts) you measure across the resistor. Note 
that the resistor value will not be exactly 1 Ω 
in practice, so your reading may be off as much 
as  5%–10%,  depending  on  the  tolerance  of 
your resistor and the accuracy of your meter. 
To get a more accurate result for your current 
 measurement, first measure the actual resis-
tance of your 1 Ω resistor, and then use that 
resistance in your calculation for current. (You 
can get a refresher on Ohm’s Law in Chapter 6.)
