Wire spacing can decrease the cross coupling capacitance value
effectively (Mohamed et al., 2003). Figure 8.8 shows that as the
spacing between wires increases, the peak noise decreases. The
noise relatively decreases faster for a small Ra (aggressor driver
resistance). Moreover, it is clear that sizing up the victim driver
(scaling Rv down) reduces peak noise, where Rv is the victim
driver resistance.
