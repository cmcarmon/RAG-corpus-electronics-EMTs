In many electronic devices, such as radio or television receivers or radar systems, a particular
frequency must be selected from a band of frequencies. This could be done by using a separate rf
amplifier for each frequency and then turning on the appropriate rf amplifier. It would be more efficient if
a single rf amplifier could be "tuned" to the particular frequency as that frequency is needed. This is what
