SIP is based on an HTTP-like request/response transaction
model. Each transaction consists of a request that invokes a
particular method, or function, on the server and at least one
response. Just as for HTTP, all requests and responses use
textual encoding for SIP. Some commands and responses of
SIP and their use are illustrated in Table 7.8.
