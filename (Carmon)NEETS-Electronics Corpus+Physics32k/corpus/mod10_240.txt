The PERIOD of a radio wave is simply the amount of time required for the completion of one full 
cycle. If a sine wave has a frequency of 2 hertz, each cycle has a duration, or period, of one-half second. 
If the frequency is 10 hertz, the period of each cycle is one-tenth of a second. Since the frequency of a 
radio wave is the number of cycles that are completed in one second, you should be able to see that as the 
frequency of a radio wave increases, its period decreases.
