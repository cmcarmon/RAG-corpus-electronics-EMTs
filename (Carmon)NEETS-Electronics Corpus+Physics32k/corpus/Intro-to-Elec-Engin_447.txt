Differential Ampliﬁer
Figure 5.4.9 shows a weighted differencing ampliﬁer, where “weighted” refers to the fact that
the output voltage has the form vo = wava + wbvb, in which the weighting coefﬁcients wa and
wb are the voltage gains seen by the inputs. Since the network is linear, superposition can be
applied for analysis. First, by grounding the input terminal of R3, let us make va = 0. Except
for the presence of R3 in parallel with R4, between terminal 2 and ground, the circuit is that of
an inverting ampliﬁer of gain −R2/R1 to the input vb. Since no current ﬂows at terminal 2, it
follows that
