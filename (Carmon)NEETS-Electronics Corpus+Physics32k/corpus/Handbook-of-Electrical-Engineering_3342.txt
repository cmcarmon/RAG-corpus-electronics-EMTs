Light detection: The conversion of light energy into an electrical signal, either current or voltage.
Light emission: The creation or emission of light from a surface or device.
Point  source: A  light  source  which  is  so  small  that  its  size  and  shape  cannot  be  determined  from  the
characteristics of the light emanating from it. The light emitted has a spherical wave front and is spatially
coherent.
