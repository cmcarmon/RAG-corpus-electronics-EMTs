The solution to problem QP-3 was described in Section 4.4.3
in purely mathematical terms and without consideration of
any computational aspects. Naturally, the solution described
by equations 4.63 and 4.64 is determined from a program
running on a digital computer. In this section, the time and
memory requirements of three different computer implemen-
tations are analyzed in greater detail. The run time complexity
N of these algorithms is considered to be dependent on the
number of multiplicative (multiple and divide) ﬂoating point
operations. Similarly, the memory complexity M is considered
to be the largest number of ﬂoating point storage units that
must be stored in memory at any time during the execution of
the speciﬁc algorithm.19
