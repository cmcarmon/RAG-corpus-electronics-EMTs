▶✓ Center gap: The ditch between columns e and f on the breadboard in 
Figure 15-2 provides an electrical gap between the two center sections 
of the board. It’s important to remember that there are no internal connec-
tions across this center gap. Many integrated circuits (ICs) are packaged 
in dual inline packages (DIPs) so that you can straddle them across the 
center gap and instantly set up independent sets of connections for each 
of its pins.
