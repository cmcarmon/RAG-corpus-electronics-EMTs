In cases where the moving piece is ambiguous, the starting square is added after the letter for the piece but before the movement indication.
For example, in diagrams below, Black has three golds which can move to square 78. Thus, simply notating G-78 is not enough to indicate the move. The three possible moves are distinguished via the origin specification as G77-78, G68-78, or G79-78.
