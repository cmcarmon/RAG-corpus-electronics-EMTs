eutectic point (a single melting point). All other 
combinations start melting at one temperature, pass 
through a plastic stage, and then become a liquid at 
a higher temperature. Any physical movement of the 
components being soldered while the solder is in the 
plastic stage results in a fractured solder connec-
tion. Such a connection appears dull and grainy, and 
is mechanically weaker and less reliable. Therefore, 
63/37 or 60/40 solder is commonly used in electron-
ics because it does not remain in the plastic stage 
very long.
