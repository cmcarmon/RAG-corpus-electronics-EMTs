As the angle is increased still more (rays 4 and 5), the rf energy penetrates the central area of 
maximum ionization of the layer. These rays are refracted rather slowly and are eventually returned to 
Earth at great distances. As the angle approaches vertical incidence (ray 6), the ray is not returned at all, 
but passes on through the layer.
