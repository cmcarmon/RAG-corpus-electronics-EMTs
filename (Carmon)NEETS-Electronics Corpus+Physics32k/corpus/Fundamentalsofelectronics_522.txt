Solution to Exercise 4.15 (p. 118)
The result is most easily found in the spectrum’s formula: the power in the signal-related part of x (t) is half
the power of the signal s (t).
Solution to Exercise 4.16 (p. 120)
RC e−t/RC u(t). Multiplying the frequency response
The inverse transform of the frequency response is
by 1 − e−j2πf ∆ means subtract from the original signal its time-delayed version. Delaying the frequency
RC e−(t−∆)/RC u(t − ∆). Subtracting from the undelayed
response’s time-domain version by ∆ results in 1
RC e−(t−∆)/RC u(t − ∆). Now we integrate this sum. Because the integral of
signal yields
a sum equals the sum of the component integrals (integration is linear), we can consider each separately.
Because integration and signal-delay are linear, the integral of a delayed signal equals the delayed version of
the integral. The integral is provided in the example (4.44).
Solution to Exercise 4.17 (p. 122)
If the glottis were linear, a constant input (a zero-frequency sinusoid) should yield a constant output. The
periodic output indicates nonlinear behavior.
