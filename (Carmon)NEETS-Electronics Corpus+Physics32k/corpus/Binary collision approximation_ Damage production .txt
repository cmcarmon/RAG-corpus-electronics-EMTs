The BCA simulations give naturally the ion penetration depth, lateral spread and nuclear and electronic deposition energy distributions in space. They can also be used to estimate the damage produced in materials, by using the assumption that any recoil which receives an energy higher than the threshold displacement energy of the material will produce a stable defect.
However, this approach should be used with great caution for several reasons. For instance, it does not account for any thermally activated recombination of damage, nor the well known fact that in metals the damage production is for high energies only something like 20% of the Kinchin-Pease prediction. Moreover, this approach only predicts the damage production as if all defects were isolated Frenkel pairs, while in reality in many cases collision cascades produce defect clusters or even dislocations as the initial damage state. BCA codes can, however, be extended with damage clustering and recombination models that improve on their reliability in this respect. Finally, the average threshold displacement energy is not very accurately known in most materials.
