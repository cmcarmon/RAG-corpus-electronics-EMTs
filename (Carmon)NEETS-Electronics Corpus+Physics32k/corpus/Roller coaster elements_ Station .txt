The station is the area where lines to rides divide into lanes to board the roller coaster.
The station is also an area for riders to exit. Often, on high impact coasters, guests will be able to place personal items in a safe location in stations to ensure items would not get damaged or destroyed on the roller coaster. After the ride, guests claim items.
