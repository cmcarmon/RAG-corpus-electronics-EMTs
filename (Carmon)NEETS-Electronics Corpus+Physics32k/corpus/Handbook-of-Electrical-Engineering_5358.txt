The complete TPV system includes: (1) a fuel and a burner that is non-direct solar, (2) a radiator using either
selective or broadband emitters, (3) a long-wave photon recovery mechanism, (4) a PV cell or converter, and
(5) a waste-heat recuperation system. TPV represents a growing and intensive research area for photovoltaics.
