Let’s assume that the bias voltage in figure 1-17 is -6 volts. Let’s also assume that the peak-to-peak
signal voltage from the transformer is 6 volts. Each of these voltage waveforms is shown in figure 1-18.
From past experience you know that voltages in series ADD. Figure 1-18 has a table of the instantaneous
values of the two voltages added together. The waveforms are drawn from these values.
