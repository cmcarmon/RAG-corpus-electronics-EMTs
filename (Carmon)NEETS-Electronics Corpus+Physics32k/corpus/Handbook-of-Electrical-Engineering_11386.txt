Fundamentals of Acoustics
Unlike electromagnetic waves, acoustic waves require a medium for propagation. The acoustic wave phenom-
enon causes displacement of particles (consisting of many molecules), which results in pressure and density
changes within the medium. For a traveling sinusoidal wave, the variation in acoustic pressure (the difference
between  the  total  and  ambient  pressure),  excess  density,  particle  displacement,  particle  velocity,  and  particle
acceleration can all be represented by the form
