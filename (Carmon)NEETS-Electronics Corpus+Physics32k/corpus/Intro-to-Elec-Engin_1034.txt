since the average value of the double-frequency sine term is zero. If the machine
is brought up to synchronous speed (ωm = ωs), an average unidirectional torque is
established. Continuous energy conversion takes place at synchronous speed. Note
that the machine is not self-starting, since an average unidirectional torque is not
developed at ωm = 0 with the speciﬁed electrical excitations.
