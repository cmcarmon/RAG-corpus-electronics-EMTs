Directories can contain subdirectories, leading to a hierar-
chical ﬁle system. The root directory is denoted as / and
usually contains several subdirectories. The / character is also
used to separate directory names so that the name /usr/man/
sort 1 denotes the ﬁle sort. 1 located in the directory man,
which itself is in the /usr directory. Some of the major direc-
tories of the average UNIX ﬁle system are shown in Table 4.2.
