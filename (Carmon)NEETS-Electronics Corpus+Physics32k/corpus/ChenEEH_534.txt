Table 6.1. Properties of Important Semiconductors. Note: a: Lattice constant, er : Dielectric constant, r: Density, Eg : Energy band gap, mn: Electron effective
mass (density of states effective mass for Si and Ge and central valley effective mass for GaAs and InP), mp: Hole effective mass (density of states effective mass),
mn: Electron mobility, mp: hole mobility. All are at 300 K. Table adapted from Fjeldy et al. (1998).
