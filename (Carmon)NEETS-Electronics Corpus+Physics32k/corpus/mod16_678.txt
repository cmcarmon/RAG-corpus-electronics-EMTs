To get maximum usefulness from an oscilloscope, you must have a means of connecting the desired
signal to the oscilloscope input. Aside from cable connections between any equipment output and the
oscilloscope input, a variety of probes are available to assist in monitoring signals at almost any point in a
circuit. The more common types include 1-TO-1 PROBES, ATTENUATION PROBES, and CURRENT
PROBES. Each of these probes may be supplied with several different tips to allow measurement of
signals on any type of test point. Figure 6-40 shows some of the more common probe tips.
