By the second step of the Th√©venin method, the resistance RTH is found by measuring
(cid:3)
the resistance of the open-circuit network seen from the aa
port with the independent
current source set to zero; that is, with the current source replaced with an open circuit
as illustrated in Figure 3.64. It is easy to see that
RTH = 2 .
