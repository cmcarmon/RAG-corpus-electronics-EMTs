The frequencies falling between 3000 hertz (3 kHz) and 300,000,000,000 hertz (300 GHz) are called 
RADIO FREQUENCIES (abbreviated rf) since they are commonly used in radio communications. This 
part of the radio frequency spectrum is divided into bands, each band being 10 times higher in frequency 
than the one immediately below it. This arrangement serves as a convenient way to remember the range 
of each band. The rf bands are shown in table 2-1. The usable radio-frequency range is roughly 10 
kilohertz to 100 gigahertz.
