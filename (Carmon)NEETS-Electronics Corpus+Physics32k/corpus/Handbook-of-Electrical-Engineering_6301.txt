The  CRT  remains  the  dominant  type  of  display  for  both  consumer  and  professional  525-/625-line  television
applications. The Eidophor and light-valve systems using a modulated light source have found wide application for
presentations  to  large  audiences  in  theater  environments,  particularly  where  high  screen  brightness  is  required.
Matrix-driven ï¬‚at-panel displays are used in increasing numbers for small-screen personal television receivers and
for portable projector units. Video and data projectors using LCD technology have gained wide acceptance.
