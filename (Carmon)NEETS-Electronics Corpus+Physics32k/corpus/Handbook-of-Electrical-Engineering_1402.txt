The estimation-quantization approach has been most popular in designing encoders for speech signals given
noisy  signals.  Since  such  design  requires  explicit  knowledge  of  the  statistics  of  the  clean  signal  and  the  noise
process, but this knowledge is not available as argued in the second section, a variety of suboptimal encoders
were proposed. Most of the research in this area focused on designing encoders for the AR model of the signal
due to the importance of such encoders in low bit-rate speech coding. The proposed encoders mainly differ in
the estimators they used and the functionals of the speech signal these estimators have been applied to. Important
examples  of  functionals  which  have  commonly  been  estimated  include  the  signal  waveform,  autocorrelation,
and the spectral magnitude. The primarily set of estimators used for this application were obtained from the
spectral subtraction approach and its derivatives. A version of the sample average estimator was also developed
and applied to AR modeling by Juang and Rabiner in 1987 [Ephraim, 1992]. Recently, the HMM-based estimator
of the autocorrelation function of the clean signal was used in AR model vector quantization [Ephraim, 1992].
Designing of AR model-based encoders from noisy signals has been a very successful application of speech
enhancement. In this case both the quality and intelligibility of the encoded signal can be improved compared
to the case where the encoder is designed for the clean signal and the input noise is simply ignored. The reason
is  that  the  input  noise  has  devastating  effects  of  the  performance  of  AR  model-based  speech  coders,  and  any
“reasonable” estimation approach can signiﬁcantly improve the performance of those coders in noisy environments.
