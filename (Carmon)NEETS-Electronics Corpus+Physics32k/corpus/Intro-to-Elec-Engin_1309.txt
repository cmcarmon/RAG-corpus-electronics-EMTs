The preceding observation is of practical interest because many information-bearing wave-
forms are low-pass signals, and transmission cables often behave like low-pass ﬁlters. Also notice
that unwanted components at f > W contained in a low-pass signal can be eliminated by low-pass
ﬁltering without distorting the ﬁltered output waveform.
(cid:2)= K, one of the conditions given by Equation (14.1.19) for distortionless
transmission is not satisﬁed. Then the output suffers from amplitude or frequency distortion,
i.e., the amplitudes of different frequency components are selectively increased or decreased.
If θ (f ) does not satisfy the condition given in Equation (14.1.19), then the output suffers from
phase or delay distortion, i.e., different frequency components are delayed by different amounts
of time. Both types of linear distortion usually occur together.
