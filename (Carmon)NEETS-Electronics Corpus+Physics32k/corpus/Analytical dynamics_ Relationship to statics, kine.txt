Historically, there were three branches of classical mechanics:
"statics" (the study of equilibrium and its relation to forces)
"kinetics" (the study of motion and its relation to forces).
"kinematics" (dealing with the implications of observed motions without regard for circumstances causing them).
These three subjects have been connected to dynamics in several ways. One approach combined statics and kinetics under the name dynamics, which became the branch dealing with determination of the motion of bodies resulting from the action of specified forces; another approach separated statics, and combined kinetics and kinematics under the rubric dynamics. This approach is common in engineering books on mechanics, and is still in widespread use among mechanicians.
