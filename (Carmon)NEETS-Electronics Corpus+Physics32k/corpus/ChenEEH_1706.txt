Temporal Motion Features
Video is a medium that is very rich in dynamic content.
Motion stands out as the most distinguishing feature for
indexing video data. Motion cue is hard to extract since com-
putation of the motion trail often involves generation of
optical ﬂow. The problem of computing optical ﬂow between
successive frames of the image sequence is recognized to be
computationally intensive, so few systems use motion cue
to a full extent. The optical ﬂow represents a 2-D ﬁeld
of instantaneous velocities corresponding to each pixel
in
the image sequence. Instead of computing the ﬂow directly
on image brightness values, it is also possible to ﬁrst process
the raw image sequence for contrast, entropy, or spatial deriva-
tives. The computation of optical ﬂow can then be performed
on these transformed pixel brightness values instead of on the
original images in an effort to reduce the computational over-
head. In either case, a relatively dense ﬂow ﬁeld is obtained at
each pixel in the image sequence. Another approach to esti-
mating object motion in the scene can be performed by using a
feature-matching based method. This approach involves com-
putation of relatively sparse but highly discriminatory features
in a frame. The features can be points, lines, or curves and are
extracted from each frame of the video sequence. Interframe
correspondence is then established between these features to
compute the motion parameters in the video sequence.
