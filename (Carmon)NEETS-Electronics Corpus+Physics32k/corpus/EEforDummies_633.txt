Capacitor C1 allows only AC to pass 
through to the transistor, blocking 
any DC component of the input signal 
(an effect known as a DC offset), as 
shown in Figure 10-8. Without that 
blocking capacitor, any DC offset in 
the input signal would be added to 
the bias voltage, potentially saturat-
ing the transistor or shutting it off 
(cutoff) so it no longer acts like an 
amplifier.
