The elastic collision of two hard spheres is an instructive example that demonstrates the sense of calling this quantity a cross section. R and r are respectively the radii of the scattering center and scattered sphere, b the impact parameter, and θ the polar angle of the exit trajectory as above. The total cross section is

{\displaystyle \sigma _{\text{tot}}=\pi \left(r+R\right)^{2}.}

So in this case the total scattering cross section is equal to the area of the circle (with radius r + R) within which the center of mass of the incoming sphere has to arrive for it to be deflected, and outside which it passes by the stationary scattering center.
