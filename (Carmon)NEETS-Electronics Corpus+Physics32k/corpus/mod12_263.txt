of times per second that the instantaneous frequency is varied from the average (carrier frequency) is
controlled by the frequency of the modulating signal. The amount by which the frequency departs from
the average is controlled by the amplitude of the modulating signal. This variation is referred to as the
FREQUENCY DEVIATION of the frequency-modulated wave. We can now establish two clear-cut rules
for frequency deviation rate and amplitude in frequency modulation:
