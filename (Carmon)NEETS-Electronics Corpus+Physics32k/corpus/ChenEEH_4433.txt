The state of a system is the minimal set of information required
to completely summarize the status of the system at an initial
time t0. Because the state is a complete summary of the status of
the system, it is immaterial how the system managed to get to its
state at t0. In addition, knowledge of the state at t0, of the inputs
to the system for t > t0, and of the dynamics of the system
allows the state to be determined for all t > t0. Therefore, the
concept of state allows time to be divided into past (t < t0),
present (t Â¼ t0), and future (t > t0), with the state at t0 sum-
marizing the information from the past that is necessary (to-
gether with knowledge of the system inputs) to predict the
future evolution of the system.
