Holographic Dark Energy models compared to Cosmological Constant models, imply a high degeneracy. It has been suggested that dark energy might originate from quantum fluctuations of spacetime, and are limited by the event horizon of the universe.
Studies with quintessence dark energy found that it dominates gravitational collapse in a spacetime simulation, based on the holographic thermalization. These results show that the smaller the state parameter of quintessence is, the harder it is for the plasma to thermalize.
