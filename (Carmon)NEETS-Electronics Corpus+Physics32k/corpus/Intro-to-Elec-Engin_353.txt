Another method that is sometimes useful in a laboratory environment for determining
whether the total power is the sum or difference of the two wattmeter readings is described
here. To begin, make sure that both wattmeters have an upscale deﬂection. To perform the
test, remove the lead of the potential coil of the lower reading wattmeter from the common
line that has no current coil, and touch the lead to the line that has the current coil of the
higher reading wattmeter. If the pointer of the lower reading wattmeter deﬂects upward, the
two wattmeter readings should be added; if the pointer deﬂects in the below-zero direction, the
wattage reading of the lower reading wattmeter should be subtracted from that of the higher
reading wattmeter.
