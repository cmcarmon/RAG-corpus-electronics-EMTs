Ofﬁce Friendly
Several  notable  conclusions  were  derived  from  the  marketing  research. Secondary market research  suggests
that  over  70%  of  LAN  node  installations  were  estimated  to  reside  in  an  ofﬁce  environment  (as  opposed  to
factories  and  warehouses).  Therefore,  as  an  ofﬁce-oriented  offering,  a  wireless  system  would  have  to  be,  by
deﬁnition,  ofﬁce  friendly.  A  traditional  ofﬁce  is  composed  of  hard  ofﬁces  with  opening  and  closing  doors,
furniture and personnel movement, cubicles, conference rooms, and walls of varying thickness and substance.
Therefore, a wireless system must continually adapt to different and changing conditions and ofﬁce layouts.
