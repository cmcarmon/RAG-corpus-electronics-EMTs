where 
  is  the  value  of  the  ﬁeld  along  an  element  edge  (see
Fig. 44.3). The functions, Eqs. (44.8) and (44.9), have the property of being divergence free, and most important

they ensure that the tangential component of 
in the normal component. In nonconducting regions where the ﬁeld can be economically modeled by a scalar
potential, standard nodal elements can be used. At the interface the edge elements couple exactly with the nodal
elements.
