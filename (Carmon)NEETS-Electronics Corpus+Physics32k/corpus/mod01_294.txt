THE INTENSITY OF ATTRACTION/REPULSION between magnetic poles may be described
by a law almost identical to Coulombâ€™s Law of Charged Bodies, that is, the force between two poles is
directly proportional to the product of the pole strengths and inversely proportional to the square of the
distance between the poles.
