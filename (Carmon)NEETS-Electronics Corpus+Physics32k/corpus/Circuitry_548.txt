Practical investigation  
 
Objective 
 
To 
a  Z80 
microprocessor  using  a  simulator  to  run  a  simple 
assembly language program. 
 
Simulator 
Oshonsoft  Z80  Simulator  or  similar  Integrated 
Development  Environment  (IDE).  The    Oshonsoft 
IDE can be downloaded from www.oshonsoft.com.   
Alternatively,  a  Z80  development  system  with 
resident assembler and I/O ports can be used (note 
that  port  addresses  used 
the  Practical 
Investigation  may  need to be  modified in order to 
agree with those available).  
 
System configuration and required operation 
 
For  the  purposes  of  this  investigation  we  shall 
assume  that  the  system  has  eight  input  switches 
connected  to  port  address  80H  and  eight  LED
