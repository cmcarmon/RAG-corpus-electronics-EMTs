The term reluctance was coined in May 1888 by Oliver Heaviside. The notion of “magnetic resistance” was first mentioned by James Joule  and the term "magnetomotive force” (MMF) was first named by Bosanquet. The idea for a magnetic flux law, similar to Ohm's law for closed electric circuits, is attributed to H. Rowland.
