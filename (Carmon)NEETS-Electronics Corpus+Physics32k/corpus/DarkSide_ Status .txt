Darkside-50 is operating with 46 kg of argon target mass. A 3 year run is planned and ton-scale expansion has been proposed.
Initial results using a month of running were reported in 2014. Spin-independent limits were set using 1422 kg×days of exposure to atmospheric argon. A cross section limit of 6.1×10−44 cm2 for a 100 Gev WIMP was found.
