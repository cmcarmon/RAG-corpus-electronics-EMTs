where f1 is the lower cut-off frequency in Hz, CIN is 
in Farads and RIN is in ohms.  
  Provided  the  upper  frequency  response  it  not 
limited by the gain Ã— bandwidth product, the upper 
cut-off  frequency  will  be  determined  by 
the 
feedback capacitance, CF, and feedback resistance, 
RF, such that:
