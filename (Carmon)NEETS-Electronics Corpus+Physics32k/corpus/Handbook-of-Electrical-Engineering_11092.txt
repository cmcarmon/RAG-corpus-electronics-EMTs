The so-called capacitively coupled device (E in Table 113.2) generates a continuous sine wave at a frequency
of 60 kHz. The total current through the skin contains a not negligible conduction component since conductive
contact is made between the applicator electrodes and the skin that represents a “leaky” capacitor. Electric ﬁelds
produced at the tissue level by this device are between 1 and 50 V/m [Pollack and Brighton, 1989]. These levels
