To subtract A from 7, you must borrow. To borrow you must first borrow from the 2. The 0 becomes
1016, which can give up a borrow. Reduce the 1016 by 1 to provide a borrow for the 7. Reducing 1016 by 1
equals F. Subtracting A16 from 1716 gives you D16. Bring down the 1 and F for a difference of 1FD16.
