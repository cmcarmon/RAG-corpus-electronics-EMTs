for electrons to ﬂow with controlled amounts of resistance. It is also vitally important that we
be able to prevent electrons from ﬂowing where we don’t want them to, by using insulating
materials. However, not all conductors are the same, and neither are all insulators. We need
to understand some of the characteristics of common conductors and insulators, and be able to
apply these characteristics to speciﬁc applications.
