Video Signal Processors
The term digital signal processor (DSP) is generally reserved for microprocessors optimized for signal processing
algorithms and which run at audio rates. A video signal processor (VSP) is a DSP that is capable of running
at video rates. Using separate names for audio and video rate processors is reasonable because VSPs provide
much greater parallelism and signiÔ¨Åcantly different microarchitectures.
