One of the early approaches in ﬂoorplanning is the hierarchical, where recursive bipartition or partition into
more than two parts is recursively employed and a ﬂoorplan tree is constructed. The tree simply reﬂects the
hierarchical  construction  of  the  ﬂoorplan.  Figure 25.9  shows  a  hierarchical  ﬂoorplan  and  its  associated  tree.
The partitioning problem and related algorithms are discussed extensively later in this section.
