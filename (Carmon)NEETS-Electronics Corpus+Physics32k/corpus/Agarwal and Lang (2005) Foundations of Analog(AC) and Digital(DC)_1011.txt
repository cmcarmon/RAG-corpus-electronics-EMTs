The operating point for our amplifier, along with the valid input and output
voltage ranges, is shown in Figure 7.43. For this choice of the operating point,
the maximum input voltage swing for positive excursions is 1.45 V → 1.9 V,
and the maximum input voltage swing for negative excursions is 1.45 V → 1 V.
The corresponding output voltage swings are 4 V → 0.9 V and 4 V → 5 V.
Although we chose the input operating point to be at the center of the
valid input range, notice the asymmetry of the output voltage range about
the output operating voltage. The asymmetry arises from the nonlinearity of
the gain of the MOSFET amplifier. The next chapter will discuss an approach
by which we can treat MOSFET amplifiers as linear amplifiers. Depending on
our desired input and output voltage swings, and also amplifier gain, we can
also choose other operating points for the amplifier. Other criteria for choosing
the operating point might include concerns of stability and power dissipation,
but these are beyond the scope of our discussion.
