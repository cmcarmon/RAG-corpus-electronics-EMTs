Unfortunately, continuous variations in the percentage of modulation create a number of additional 
problems. For example, damping is necessary so that a meter can provide an average reading despite 
fluctuations. An average reading, on the other hand, will not disclose the presence of transient 
overmodulation. This shortcoming is serious because of the large number of sideband frequencies 
produced in addition to the normal ones whenever overmodulation occurs. Not only do these extra 
frequencies interfere drastically with other transmissions, but they also may significantly distort the 
modulation signal. These considerations account for the importance of using a meter that responds to
