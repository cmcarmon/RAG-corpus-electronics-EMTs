In addition, note that the adjacency matrix as deﬁned in
equation 4.23 is always symmetric. The edges of g C have no
direction, so each edge between vertices vi and vj is shown in
both of the rows corresponding to i and j. In addition, all
diagonal elements of the adjacency matrix are zeros since self-
loop edges are excluded by the required circuit graph proper-
ties described in Section 4.2.2. As a ﬁnal reminder and without
any loss of generality, it is assumed that a circuit has a con-
nected graph (West, 1996). In other words, a circuit does not
have isolated groups of registers. If a speciﬁc circuit has a
disconnected graph, then each connected subgraph (subcir-
cuit) can be considered separately.
