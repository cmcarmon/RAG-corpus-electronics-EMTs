In this expression, YY k
is the mean of feature vectors Y in the
j
current frame interval j to k, and Q0 is the mean of Y in an
initial training set frame interval consisting of M frames. This
approach, which is free from human Ô¨Åne-tuning, has been
reported to perform equally well for both abrupt and gradual
scene changes.
