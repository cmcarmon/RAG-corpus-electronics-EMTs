For computational modeling of electromagnetic wave inter-
action structures using FDTD and related space-grid time-
domain techniques, it is useful to consider the concept of a
predictive dynamic range. Let the power density of the primary
(incident) wave in the space grid be P0W=m2. Further, let the
minimum observable power density of a secondary (scattered)
wave be PSW=m2, where ‘‘minimum observable’’ means that
the accuracy of the ﬁeld computation degrades due to numer-
ical artifacts to poorer than n decibels (some desired ﬁgure of
merit) at lower levels than PS. Then, the predictive dynamic
range can be deﬁned as 10 log10 (P0=PS)dB.
