An enthalpy change occurs during a chemical reaction. For the special case of the formation of a compound from the elements, the change is designated ΔHform and is a weak function of temperature. Values of ΔHform are usually given where the elements and compound are in their normal standard states, and as such are designated standard heats of formation, as designated by a superscript °. The ΔH°form undergoes discontinuities at a phase transition temperatures of the constituent element(s) and the compound. The enthalpy change for any standard reaction is designated ΔH°rx.
