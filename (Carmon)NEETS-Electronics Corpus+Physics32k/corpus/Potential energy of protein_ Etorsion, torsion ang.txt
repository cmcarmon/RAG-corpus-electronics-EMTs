The middle bond of three bonds formed by four atoms maintains a certain angle which is also known as torsion is defined over set Storsion the quartet of atoms that are connected by three chemical bonds, as follows;
Etorsion = Σ (i,j,k,l) E Storsionkijklt[1+cos(nαijkl- αijkl0 )]
where:
kijklt is the force constant
αijkl0 is the equilibrium angle
αijkl is the torsion angle
