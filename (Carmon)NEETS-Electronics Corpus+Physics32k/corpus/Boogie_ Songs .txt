Swing-era boogie hits include the 1940 Glenn Miller song "Boog It" (#7) and The Andrews Sisters' number two hit from that same year, "Beat Me Daddy, Eight to the Bar". In the mid-1940s, bandleader Tommy Dorsey had a number five hit with "Boogie Woogie", jump blues maestro Louis Jordan had a number six hit with "Caldonia Boogie", and Count Basie scored a number 10 hit with "Mad Boogie".
In 1948, Freddie Martin had a number six hit with "Sabre Dance Boogie" and three years later, Ernie Ford hit number four with his "Shot Gun Boogie". After several decades out of the hits catalogue, singer-actress Bette Midler hit number eight in 1973 with her cover of the song Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy; the original track, whose details Midler reproduced closely, was a 1941 national hit for the Andrews Sisters. Other well-known songs using a boogie rhythm or bass pattern include Chuck Berry's "Johnny B. Goode", The intro to Led Zeppelin's "Bring It On Home"; Marvin Gaye's "Can I Get a Witness" and The Shadows's "Shadoogie"; and Jerry Lee Lewis playing "Great Balls of Fire".
