Fuse short-circuit performance characteristics are published in the form of peak let-through (Ip) graphs and
I 2t graphs. Ip (peak current) is simply the peak of the shaded triangular waveform, which increases as the fault
current increases, as shown in Fig. 1.34(b). The electromagnetic forces, which can cause mechanical damage
