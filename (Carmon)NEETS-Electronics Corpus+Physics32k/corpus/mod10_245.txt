As discussed earlier, a radio wave travels 300,000,000 meters a second (speed of light); therefore, a 
radio wave of 1 hertz would have traveled a distance (or wavelength) of 300,000,000 meters. Obviously 
then, if the frequency of the wave is increased to 2 hertz, the wavelength will be cut in half to 
150,000,000 meters. This illustrates the principle that the HIGHER THE FREQUENCY, the SHORTER 
THE WAVELENGTH.
