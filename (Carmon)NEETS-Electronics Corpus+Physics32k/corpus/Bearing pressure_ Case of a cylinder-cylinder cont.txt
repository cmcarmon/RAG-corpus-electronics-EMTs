In the case of a revolute joint or of a hinge joint, there is a contact between a male cylinder and a female cylinder. The complexity depends on the situation, and three cases are distinguished:
the clearance is negligible:
a) the parts are rigid bodies,
b) the parts are elastic bodies;

c) the clearance cannot be ignored and the parts are elastic bodies.
By "negligible clearance", H7/g6 fit is typically meant.
The axes of the cylinders are along the z-axis, and two external forces apply to the male cylinder:
a force






F
â†’





{\displaystyle {\vec {F}}}
along the y-axis, the load;
the action of the bore (contact pressure).
The main concern is the contact pressure with the bore, which is uniformly distributed along the z-axis.
Notation:
D is the nominal diameter of both male and female cylinders;
L the guiding length.
