deﬁnition,  not  at  every  place  of  usage.  Moreover,  global  deﬁnitions  that  replace  numeric  or  alphanumeric
constants by descriptive identiﬁers improve the readability of a program. Nonlocal variables, on the other hand,
are  to  be  avoided.  For  reasons  of  simplicity  and  clarity,  the  task  performed  by  a  subprogram  should  be
determined exclusively by the subprogram itself and the values of its parameters. As a result, all information
needed to understand why a subprogram may behave differently for different invocations is provided at each
point of invocation. This rule, related to the concept of referential transparency, is clearly violated if a subprogram
