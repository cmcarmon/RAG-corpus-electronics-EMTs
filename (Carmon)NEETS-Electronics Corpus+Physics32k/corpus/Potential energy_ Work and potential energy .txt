Potential energy is closely linked with forces. If the work done by a force on a body that moves from A to B does not depend on the path between these points, then the work of this force measured from A assigns a scalar value to every other point in space and defines a scalar potential field. In this case, the force can be defined as the negative of the vector gradient of the potential field.
If the work for an applied force is independent of the path, then the work done by the force is evaluated at the start and end of the trajectory of the point of application. This means that there is a function U (x), called a "potential," that can be evaluated at the two points xA and xB to obtain the work over any trajectory between these two points. It is tradition to define this function with a negative sign so that positive work is a reduction in the potential, that is

{\displaystyle W=\int _{C}{\mathbf {F} }\cdot \mathrm {d} {\mathbf {x} }=U(\mathbf {x} _{A})-U(\mathbf {x} _{B})}

where C is the trajectory taken from A to B. Because the work done is independent of the path taken, then this expression is true for any trajectory, C, from A to B.
The function U(x) is called the potential energy associated with the applied force. Examples of forces that have potential energies are gravity and spring forces.
