To  illustrate  KVL,  consider  the  circuit  in  Fig.  2.19.  The  sign  on
each  voltage  is  the  polarity  of  the  terminal  encountered  ﬁrst  as  we
travel  around  the  loop.  We  can  start  with  any  branch  and  go  around
the  loop  either  clockwise  or  counterclockwise.  Suppose  we  start  with
the  voltage  source  and  go  clockwise  around  the  loop  as  shown;  then
voltages  would  be 
in  that  order.  For
example, as we reach branch 3, the positive terminal is met ﬁrst; hence,
we have 
For branch 4, we reach the negative terminal ﬁrst; hence,
⫺v4.
