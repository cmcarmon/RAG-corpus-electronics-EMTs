Swimming pools are another source of trouble, since people often operate radios and other
powered appliances nearby. The National Electrical Code requires that special shock-detecting
receptacles called Ground-Fault Current Interrupting (GFI or GFCI) be installed in wet and
outdoor areas to help prevent shock incidents. More on these devices in a later section of this
chapter. These special devices have no doubt saved many lives, but they can be no substitute
for common sense and diligent precaution. As with ﬁrearms, the best ”safety” is an informed
and conscientious operator.
