Zener diodes are packaged like P–N junction diodes 
(Figure 30-1). Low-power zener diodes are mounted 
in either glass or epoxy. High-power zener diodes are 
stud mounted with a metal case. The schematic sym-
bol for the zener diode is similar to the P–N junction 
diode except for the diagonal lines on the cathode bar 
(Figure 30-2).
