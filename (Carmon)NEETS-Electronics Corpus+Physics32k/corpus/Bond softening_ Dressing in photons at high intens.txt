At high laser intensity absorptions and stimulated emissions of photons are so frequent that the molecule cannot be regarded as a system separate from the laser field; the molecule is "dressed" in photons forming a single system. However, the number of photons in this system varies when photons are absorbed and emitted. Therefore, to plot the energy diagram of the dressed molecule, we need to repeat the energy curves at each number of photons. The number of photons is very large but only a few curve repetitions need to be considered in this very tall ladder, as shown in Fig. 1b.
In the dressed model, photon absorption (and emission) is no longer represented by vertical transitions. As the energy must be conserved, photon absorption occurs at the curve crossings. For example, if the molecule is in the ground electronic state with 1015 photons present, it can jump to the repulsive state absorbing a photon at the curve crossing (violet circle) and dissociate to the 1015-1 photon limit (red arrow). This "curve jumping" is in fact continuous and can be explained in terms of avoided crossings.
