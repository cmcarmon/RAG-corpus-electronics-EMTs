If both a higher voltage and a higher current are  desired, 
the cells or batteries can be connected in a series-parallel 
configuration. Remember, connecting cells or batteries 
in series increases the voltage, and connecting cells or 
batteries in parallel increases the current. Figure 12-20 
shows four 3-volt batteries connected in a series-parallel
