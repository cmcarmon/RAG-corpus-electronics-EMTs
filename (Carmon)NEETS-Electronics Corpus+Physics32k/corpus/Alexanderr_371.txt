Note that the negative sign on I(L1) is needed because the current
enters through the upper terminal of the inductor, which happens to be
the negative terminal after one counterclockwise rotation. A way to avoid
the negative sign is to ensure that current enters pin 1 of the inductor.
To  obtain  this  desired  direction  of  positive  current  ﬂow,  the  initially
270⬚
horizontal  inductor  symbol  should  be  rotated  counterclockwise 
and placed in the desired location.
