The largest motions, or eddies, of turbulence contain most of the kinetic energy, whereas the smallest eddies are responsible for the viscous dissipation of turbulence kinetic energy. Kolmogorov hypothesized that when these scales are well separated, the intermediate range of length scales would be statistically isotropic and that its characteristics would depend only on the rate at which kinetic energy is dissipated. Dissipation is the frictional conversion of mechanical energy to thermal energy. The dissipation rate, ε, may be written down in terms of the fluctuating rates of strain in the turbulent flow and the fluid's kinematic viscosity, ν. It has dimensions of energy per unit mass per second. The production of turbulence kinetic energy at the large scales of motion is accompanied by the dissipation of this energy at the small scales.
