The UMTS bearer service uses the radio access bearer service
(RAB) and the core network bearer service (CN). Both the
RAB and CN reﬂect the optimized way to realize UMTS bearer
service over the respective cellular network topology, taking
into account aspects such as mobility and mobile subscriber
proﬁles. The RAB provides conﬁdential transport of signaling
and user data between the MT and the CN Iu edge node with
the QoS negotiated by the UMTS bearer service. This service is
based on the characteristics of the radio interface and is main-
tained even for a mobile MT.
