Printed wire antennas are planar adaptations of wire antennas,
such as dipole, loop, or spiral antennas. Due to a number of
reasons, only limited success has been achieved at developing
working versions of truly planar wire antennas. This is in part
due to the popularity of microstrip and coplanar waveguide
transmission lines at these frequencies, which are difﬁcult to
integrate with wire-based antennas. For instance, a printed
microstrip dipole will have very small radiation resistance
due to the shorting effect of the microstrip ground plane and
consequently will have low efﬁciency when realistic estimates
of losses are taken. This can be overcome by using an electric-
ally thick substrate at the cost of increased losses due to
substrate waves and increased weight and cost.
