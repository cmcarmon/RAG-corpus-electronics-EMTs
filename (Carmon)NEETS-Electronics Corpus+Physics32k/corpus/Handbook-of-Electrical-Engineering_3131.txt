Like  the  power  MOSFET,  the  IGBT  does  not  exhibit  the  secondary  breakdown  phenomenon  common  to
bipolar transistors. However, care should be taken not to exceed the maximum power dissipation and speciﬁed
maximum junction temperature of the device under all conditions for guaranteed reliable operation. The on-
state voltage of the IGBT is heavily dependent on the gate voltage. To obtain a low on-state voltage, a sufﬁciently
high gate voltage must be applied.
