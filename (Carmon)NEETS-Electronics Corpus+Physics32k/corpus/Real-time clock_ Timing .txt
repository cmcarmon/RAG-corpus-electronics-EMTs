Most RTCs use a crystal oscillator, but some use the power line frequency. In many cases, the oscillator's frequency is 32.768 kHz. This is the same frequency used in quartz clocks and watches, and for the same reasons, namely that the frequency is exactly 215 cycles per second, is a convenient rate to use with simple binary counter circuits.
Many commercial RTC ICs are accurate to less than 5 parts per million. In practical terms, this is good enough to perform celestial navigation, the classic task of a chronometer. In 2011, Chip-scale atomic clocks were invented. Although more expensive, they keep time within 100 nanoseconds.
