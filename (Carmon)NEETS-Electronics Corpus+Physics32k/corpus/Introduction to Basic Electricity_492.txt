■● Retaliation: When an employer or supervisor de-
motes, terminates, verbally harasses, or singles out 
an employee because this person would not submit 
to sexual advances or because he or she filed a 
discrimination complaint, the  supervisor is retali-
ating against the person. Retaliation can also oc-
cur as a result of an employee acting as witness or 
participating in a discrimination  complaint. Laws 
prohibit employers from creating a hostile work 
environment through retaliation.
