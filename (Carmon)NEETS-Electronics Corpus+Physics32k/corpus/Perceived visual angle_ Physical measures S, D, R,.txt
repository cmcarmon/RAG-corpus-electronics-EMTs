Figure 1 illustrates an observer's eye looking at a frontal extent AB that has a linear size S (also called its "metric size" or "tape-measure size"). The extent's lower endpoint at B lies at a distance D from point O, which for present purposes can represent the center of the eye's entrance pupil.
The line from B through O indicates the chief ray of the bundle of light rays that form the optical image of B on the retina at point b, let's say, on the fovea. Likewise, endpoint A is imaged at point a.
The optical (physical) angle between those chief rays is the visual angle θ which can be calculated:

The retinal images at b and a are separated by the distance R, given by the equation

{\displaystyle R/n=\tan \theta \,}

in which n is the eye's nodal distance that averages about 17 mm. That is, a viewed object's retinal image size is approximately given by R = 17 S/D mm.
The line from point O outward through object point B specifies the optical direction, dB, of the object's base from the eye, let's say toward the horizon. The line from point O through point A specifies that endpoint's optical direction, dA, toward some specific elevation value (say, 18 degrees). The difference between those real directions (dA − dB) is, again, the visual angle θ.
