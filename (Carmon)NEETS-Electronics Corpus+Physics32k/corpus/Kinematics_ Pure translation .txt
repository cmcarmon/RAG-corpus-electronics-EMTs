If a rigid body moves so that its reference frame M does not rotate (∅=0) relative to the fixed frame F, the motion is called pure translation. In this case, the trajectory of every point in the body is an offset of the trajectory d(t) of the origin of M, that is:






P


(
t
)
=
[
T
(
0
,


d


(
t
)
)
]


p


=


d


(
t
)
+


p


.


{\displaystyle {\textbf {P}}(t)=[T(0,{\textbf {d}}(t))]{\textbf {p}}={\textbf {d}}(t)+{\textbf {p}}.}

Thus, for bodies in pure translation, the velocity and acceleration of every point P in the body are given by:







V

{\displaystyle {\textbf {V}}_{P}={\dot {\textbf {P}}}(t)={\dot {\textbf {d}}}(t)={\textbf {V}}_{O},\quad {\textbf {A}}_{P}={\ddot {\textbf {P}}}(t)={\ddot {\textbf {d}}}(t)={\textbf {A}}_{O},}

where the dot denotes the derivative with respect to time and VO and AO are the velocity and acceleration, respectively, of the origin of the moving frame M. Recall the coordinate vector p in M is constant, so its derivative is zero.
