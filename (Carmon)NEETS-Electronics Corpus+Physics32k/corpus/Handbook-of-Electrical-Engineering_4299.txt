Doppler Navigators
These systems are mainly sinusoidally modulated FM/CW radars employing four separate downward looking
beams aimed at about 15 degrees off the vertical. Because commercial airlines have shifted to nonradar forms
of navigation, these units are designed principally for helicopters. Saunders [1990] cites a particular example
of a commercial unit operating at 13.3 GHz, employing a Gunn oscillator as the transmitter, with an output
power of 50 mW, and utilizing a 30-kHz modulation frequency. A single microstrip antenna is used. A low-
altitude equipment (below 15,000 feet), the unit weighs less than 12 pounds. A second unit cited has an output
power of 300 mW, dual antennas, dual modulating frequencies, and an altitude capability of 40,000 feet.
