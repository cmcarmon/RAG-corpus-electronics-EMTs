LEDs carry the same specifications as standard diodes, but they usually have 
fairly low current and PRV ratings. A typical LED has a PRV rating of about 
5 V with a maximum current rating of under 50 mA. If more current passes 
through an LED than its maximum rating specifies, the LED burns up like a 
marshmallow in a campfire. Forward voltages vary, depending on the type of 
LED; they range from 1.5 V for IR LEDs up to 3.4 V for blue LEDs. Red, yellow, 
and green LEDs typically have a forward voltage of about 2.0 V. Be sure to 
check the specifications of any LEDs you use in circuits.
