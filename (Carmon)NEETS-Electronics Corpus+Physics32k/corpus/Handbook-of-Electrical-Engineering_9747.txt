The entertainment side will grow rapidly. Movies on demand, archival information from existing print media
, the student FM radio station at
and traditional radio and TV will be available. In December of 1994, 
the University of Kansas, was the ﬁrst station to provide a real time, live and continuous programming source
to the Internet. The on-air programming of the station can be heard anywhere in the world by attaching to
their Web  site.  There  are  many  radio  stations  now “broadcasting”  over  the  Internet  and  several  commercial
software companies around to facilitate that use. On January 2, 1996, the University of Kansas provided a live
television signal to the Internet that could be viewed by computers connected to the Internet with 28.8 modems
or higher. These real time audio and video services will be used in all kinds of applications in the future. They
not only provide good quality and diverse choice, but can be delivered at very low costs since most long distance
telephone charges are not present.
