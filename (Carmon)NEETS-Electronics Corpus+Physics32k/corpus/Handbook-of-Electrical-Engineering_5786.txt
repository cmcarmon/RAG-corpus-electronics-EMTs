Transformer Windings
The windings of the power transformer may be either copper or aluminum. These conductors are usually made
of  conductors  having  a  circular  cross  section;  however,  larger  cross-sectional  area  conductors  may  require  a
rectangular cross section for efÔ¨Åcient use of winding space.
