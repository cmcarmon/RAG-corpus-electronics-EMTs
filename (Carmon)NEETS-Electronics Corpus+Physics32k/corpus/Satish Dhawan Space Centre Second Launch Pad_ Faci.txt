"As per the "Integrate, Transfer and Launch (ITL)" concept, based on which the launch pad and the associated facilities are designed, the entire vehicle is assembled and checked-out on a mobile pedestal in the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) and then moved in vertical position to the launch pad on a roll track."
"Other facilities include, Solid Stage Assembly Building (SSAB) connected to the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) by a rail track, Technical Complex-2 (TC2), Spacecraft Preparation Facility, Range Instrumentation facilities comprising tracking, telemetry and tele-command systems."
A new assembly building (SVAB - Second Vehicle Assembly Building) being constructed with a budgetary grant of â‚¹630 crore (US$96 million) is nearing completion and is expected to be ready by mid 2018.This upgrade is expected to increase the launch capacity of second launch pad complex to 11 launches per year.
