Let's review the important points of circuit operation. The capacitor is initially charged to −10 volts 
with no input signal. Applying Kirchhoff's law we find that the +25 volt input signal and the 10-volt 
battery are series opposing. This series opposing forward biases D1 and the capacitor charges to −35 
volts. The output voltage is equal to the sum of the capacitor voltage and the input voltage. Thus, the 
output voltage is −10 volts and the wave shape is clamped to −10 volts. With a −25 volt input, the charge 
maintained across C1 and the input are series aiding and provide a −60 volt output. C1 will discharge just 
before the next cycle begins and the input becomes positive. The +25 volt input signal and the 
approximately −23 volt charge remaining on C1 will forward bias D1 and the output will be clamped to 
the battery voltage. C1 will quickly charge to the input signal level. Thus, the output voltage varies 
between −10 and −60 volts and the wave shape is clamped to −10 volts.
