and shunt immittance branches that, as the name implies, are
lossless and contain only inductors and capacitors. A typical
structure of an LC ladder is shown in Figure 4.9. The circuit
consists of ﬁve ladder arms (C1, L2kC2, C3, L4kC4, and C5)
and source and load resistors R1 and R2. It can realize the
ﬁfth-order low-pass function of equation 4.2 with the trans-
fer behavior sketched in Fig. 2.6.1. The two transmission
zeros at 29.2 kHz and 43.2 kHz are realized by the parallel
resonance frequencies of L2kC2 and L4kC4. The question to
be addressed is how to implement such a circuit without the
use of inductors.
