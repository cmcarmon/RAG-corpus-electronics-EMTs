Looked at positively, because they can store energy, capacitors and induc-
tors display the memory property, and offer signal-processing possibilities not
available in circuits containing only resistors. Apply a square-wave voltage to a
multi-resistor linear circuit, and all of the voltages and currents in the network
will have the same square-wave shape. But include one capacitor in the circuit
and very different waveforms will appear
sections of exponentials, spikes,
and sawtooth waves. Figure 10.1 shows an example of such waveforms for
the two-inverter system of Figure 9.1 in Chapter 9. The linear analysis tech-
niques already developed
are adequate
for finding appropriate network equations to analyze these kinds of circuits.
However, the formulations turn out to be differential equations rather than
algebraic equations, so additional skills are needed to complete the analyses.
