Low-pass equivalent (LPE) model: A method of representing bandpass signals and systems by low-pass signals
and  systems.  This  technique  is  extremely  useful  when  developing  discrete  time  models  of  bandpass
continuous-time systems. It can substantially reduce the sampling rate required to prevent aliasing and
does  not  result  in  any  loss  of  information.  This  in  turn  reduces  the  execution  time  required  for  the
simulation.  This  modeling  technique  is  closely  related  to  the  quadrature  representation  of  bandpass
signals.
