The heart may continue to beat and the blood may still be circulated to the body cells for some time 
after breathing has stopped. Since the blood will, for a short time, contain a small supply of oxygen, the 
body cells will not die immediately. Thus, for a few minutes, there is some chance that the person's life 
may be saved. A person who has stopped breathing but who is still alive is said to be in a state of 
respiratory failure. The first aid treatment for respiratory failure is called artificial ventilation.
