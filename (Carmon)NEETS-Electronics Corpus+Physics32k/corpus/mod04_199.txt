Some equipment requires the use of twisted wires. One example is the use of "twisted pairs" for the 
ac filament leads of certain electron tube amplifiers to minimize radiation of their magnetic field. This 
prevents an annoying hum in the amplifier output. You should duplicate the original layout when relacing 
any wiring harness.
