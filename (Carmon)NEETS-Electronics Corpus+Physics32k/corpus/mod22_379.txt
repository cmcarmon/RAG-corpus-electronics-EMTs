A bit is a single binary digit. It represents the smallest unit of data just like the good old American 
penny). However, computers usually do not operate on single bits, rather they store and manipulate a 
fixed number of bits. Most often, the smallest unit or number of bits a computer works with is eight bits. 
These eight bits make up a byte. You just learned that both EBCDIC and ASCII codes use eight bits 
(excluding the parity bit), and that eight bits represent a single character, such as the letter A or the
