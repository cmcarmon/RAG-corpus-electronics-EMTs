For PSK the carrier signal changes phase every bit interval. If
we multiply the received signal by a factor N, an integer, we can
convert all of the phase changes in the multiplied signal to
multiples of 3608. The new signal then has no phase changes,
and we can recover it using a narrow band phase locked loop
(PLL). After the PLL recovers, the multiplied carrier signal it is
divided by N to recover the carrier at the proper frequency. By
the suitable choice of digital dividing circuits, it is possible to
get a precise 908 difference in the output of two dividers and
thus generate both the cos vt and the sin vt signals needed by
the receiver. There are also some down-converter integrated
circuits that contain a precise phase shift network. The carrier
recovery is typically performed at some lower intermediate
frequency rather than directly at the received frequency. For
BPSK, we would need an N or 2, but an N of 4 would be used
to enable the sine and cosine term to be generated. For QPSK
and its derivatives, an N of 4 is necessary, and for p=4-DQPSK,
an N of 8 would be needed.
