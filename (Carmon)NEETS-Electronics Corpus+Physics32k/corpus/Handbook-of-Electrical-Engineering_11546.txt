Floating Point Operations per Second) ratings for computers are 15 for a Pentium PC or low end work station,
60  for  a  fast  work  station,  and  several  hundred  for  a  super  computer.  If  we  use  200  MFLOPS  for  the  super
computer, then the calculation times for the human body are 42 h for the PC or low end work station, 10.5 h
for the fast work station, and 3.1 h for the super computer.
