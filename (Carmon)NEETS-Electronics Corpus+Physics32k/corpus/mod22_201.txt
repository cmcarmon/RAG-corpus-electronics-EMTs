The size of the matrix determines the quality of the printed character. In other words, the more dots 
used to print a character, the better the character is filled in and the higher its print quality. Dot-matrix 
printers are faster than the daisy-wheel printers with speeds ranging from 60 to 350 cps, but their print 
quality is not as good.
