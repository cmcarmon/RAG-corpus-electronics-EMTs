If a circuit develops problems that could damage the equipment or endanger personnel, it should be
possible to remove the power from that circuit. The circuit protection devices discussed in the last chapter
will remove power automatically if current or temperature increase enough to cause the circuit protection
device to act. Even with this protection, a manual means of control is needed to allow you to remove
power from the circuit before the protection device acts.
