10.2.9 A three-phase, 60-Hz substation bus supplies two
wye-connected loads that are connected in par-
allel through a three-phase feeder that has a per-
phase impedance of 0.5 + j2 . Load 1 draws
50 kW at 0.866 lagging PF, and load 2 draws 36
kVA at 0.9 leading PF. If the line-to-line voltage
at the load terminals is 460 V, ﬁnd the following:
(a) Total line current ﬂowing through the feeder.
(b) Per-phase impedance of each load.
(c) Line-to-line voltage at the substation bus.
(d) Total real and reactive power delivered by
