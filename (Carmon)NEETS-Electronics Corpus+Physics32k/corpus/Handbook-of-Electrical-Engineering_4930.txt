The  macroscopic  quantum  nature  of  superconductivity  also  affects  the  general  electromagnetic  properties
previously discussed. This is most clearly illustrated by the interplay of the characteristic lengths j, representing
the  scale  of  quantum  correlations,  and  l,  representing  the  scale  of  electromagnetic  screening.  Consider  the
scenario  where  a  magnetic  ﬁeld,  H,  is  applied  parallel  to  the  surface  of  a  semi-inﬁnite  superconductor.  The
correlations  of  the  electrons  in  the  superconductor  must  lower  the  overall  energy  of  the  system  or  else  the
material would not be superconducting in the ﬁrst place. Because the critical magnetic ﬁeld Hc destroys all the
correlations, it is convenient to deﬁne the energy density gained by the system in the superconducting state as
2. The electrons in a Cooper pair are separated on a length scale of j, however, and so the correlations
(1/2)m
cannot be fully achieved until a distance roughly j from the boundary of the superconductor. There is thus an
2j, that is lost because of the presence of the boundary. Now consider the effects
energy per unit area, (1/2)m
of the applied magnetic ﬁeld on this system. It costs the superconductor energy to maintain the Meissner effect,
B = 0, in its bulk; in fact the energy density required is (1/2)m
oH 2. However, since the ﬁeld can penetrate the
oH2l to
superconductor a distance roughly l, the system need not expend an energy per unit area of (1/2)m
screen over this volume. To summarize, more than a distance j from the boundary, the energy of the material
is lowered (because it is superconducting), and more than a distance l from the boundary the energy of the
material is raised (to shield the applied ﬁeld).
