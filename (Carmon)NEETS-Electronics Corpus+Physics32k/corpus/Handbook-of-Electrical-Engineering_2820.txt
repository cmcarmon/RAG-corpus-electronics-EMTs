Most  companies  that  have  not  converted  to  SMT  are
considering  doing  so.  All  is  of  course  not  golden  in  SMT
 board, either the component leads go through the holes or they
Land. During the assembly of a 
do not, and the component placement machines can typically detect the difference in force involved. During
SMT board assembly, the placement machine does not have such direct feedback, and accuracy of ﬁnal soldered
placement becomes a stochastic (probability-based) process, dependent on such items as component pad design,
accuracy of the PCB artwork and fabrication which affects the accuracy of trace location, accuracy of solder
paste  deposition  location  and  deposition  volume,  accuracy  of  adhesive  deposition  location  and  volume  if
adhesive  is  used,  accuracy  of  placement  machine  vision  system(s),  variations  in  component  sizes  from  the
assumed sizes, and thermal issues in the solder reﬂow process. In THT test, there is a through-hole at every
potential  test  point,  making  it  easy  to  align  a  bed-of-nails  tester.  In  SMT  designs,  there  are  not  holes  corre-
sponding to every device lead. The design team must consider form, ﬁt and function, time-to-market, existing
capabilities, testing, rework capabilities, and the cost and time to characterize a new process when deciding on
a change of technologies.
