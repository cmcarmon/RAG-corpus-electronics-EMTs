The one-shot (also called a monostable multivibrator) is essentially an unstable ﬂip-ﬂop.
When a one-shot is set by an input clock or trigger pulse, it will return to the reset state
on its own accord after a ﬁxed time delay. Hence a one-shot is able to generate a pulse
of a particular width following an input pulse. One-shots are often used in pairs with the
output of the ﬁrst used to trigger the second. Unfortunately the time relationship between
the signals becomes excessively interdependent and it is better to generate signal transitions
synchronized with the circuit clock.
