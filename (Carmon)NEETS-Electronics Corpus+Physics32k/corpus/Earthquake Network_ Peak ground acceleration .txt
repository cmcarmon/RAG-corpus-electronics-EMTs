The accelerations recorded by a dense smartphone network may be used to produce high resolution peak ground acceleration maps for the detected earthquakes. The task is complicated by the fact that smartphones are not secured to the ground and they are not directly measuring the ground acceleration. If properly calibrated, however, data from a large number of smartphones may allow to estimate the ground acceleration. Development stage: analysis.
