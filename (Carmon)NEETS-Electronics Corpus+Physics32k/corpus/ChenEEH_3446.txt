Due to the inherent shortcoming of distance relays not being
able to recognize the effect of the current in-feed from the
other end of the line and because of this possibly leading to a
wrong decision, the concept of a relaying scheme is developed.
The concept assumes that the relays at the two ends of a
transmission line will coordinate their actions by exchanging
the information that they detect for the same fault. To be able
to perform the coordination, the relays have to use a commu-
nication channel to exchange the information. In an earlier
discussion, illustrated in Figure 9.9, one of the principles for
scheme protection of transmission lines was explained. A more
comprehensive summary is given now.
