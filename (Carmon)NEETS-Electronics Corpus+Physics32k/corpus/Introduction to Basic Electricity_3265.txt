Figure 32-7 shows a cross section of a N-channel	
depletion	MOSFET. It is formed by implanting an 
N channel in a P substrate. A thin insulating layer 
of  silicon dioxide is then deposited on the channel, 
 leaving the ends of the channel exposed to be attached 
to wires and act as the source and the drain. A thin 
 metallic layer is attached to the insulating layer over the  
N channel. The metallic layer serves as the gate. 
An additional lead is attached to the substrate. The 
metal  gate  is  insulated  from  the  semiconductor 
 channel so that the gate and the channel do not form 
a Pâ€“N  junction. The metal gate is used to control the 
 conductivity of the channel, as in the JFET.
