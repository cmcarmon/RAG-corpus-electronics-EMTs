The solution methods developed are based on various assumptions. As before, machines are represented by
subtransient reactances, electrical powers can be calculated by Eq. (61.71), and the shaft power does not change
during transients. In addition, the velocity increments are assumed to start at the beginning of time increments,
and acceleration increments start at the middle of time increments; Ô¨Ånally, an average acceleration can be used
where acceleration is discontinuous (e.g., where circuit breakers open or close).
