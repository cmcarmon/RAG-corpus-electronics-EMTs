The first equality in Equation 3.49 expresses the equality of the CCCS in
Figure 3.26 and its surrogate independent current source in Figure 3.10. The
second equality follows from the substitution for i1 using Equation 3.45 from
the node analysis of the circuit in Figure 3.10. Since i1 is determined in terms
of I during that analysis, Equation 3.49 becomes an implicit equation that must
be solved for I. This solution yields
