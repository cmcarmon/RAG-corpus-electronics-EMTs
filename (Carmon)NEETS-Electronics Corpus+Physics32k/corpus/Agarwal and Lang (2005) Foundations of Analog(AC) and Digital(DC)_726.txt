Next, they look at the output voltage level for a logical 0. As depicted in Figure 5.12,
Yehaa’s devices produce a voltage level of 0.5 V for a logical 0, which falls within the
0 V to 1.5 V (VOL) range required for logical 0’s by Disco’s static discipline. Thus,
Yehaa’s devices satisfy the VOL requirement.
