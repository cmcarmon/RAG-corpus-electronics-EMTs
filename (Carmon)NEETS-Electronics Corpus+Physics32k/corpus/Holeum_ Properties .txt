{\displaystyle R=\left({\frac {2mG}{c^{2}}}\right)}
is the Schwarzschild radius of the two identical micro black holes that constitute the holeum.
The holeum is a stable particle. It is the gravitational analogue of the hydrogen atom. It occupies space. Although it is made up of black holes, it itself is not a black hole. As the holeum is a purely gravitational system, it emits only gravitational radiation and no electromagnetic radiation. The holeum can therefore be considered to be a dark matter particle.
