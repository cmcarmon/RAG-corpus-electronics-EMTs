One approach to obtaining a voltage-variable reactance is through a varactor diode, whose
capacitance changes with the applied voltage, such as the junction capacitance of a reverse-
biased diode, which depends on the amount of bias. Figure 15.2.13 illustrates the varactor-diode
implementation of an angle modulator. The frequency of the tuned circuit and the oscillator will
change in accordance with the message signal f (t). Varactor-controlled VCOs can have a nearly
linear frequency–voltage characteristic, but often yield only small frequency deviations, i.e., small
ω. Since any VCO is inherently unstable as its frequency is varied to produce FM, it becomes
necessary in many applications to stabilize the carrier’s frequency.
