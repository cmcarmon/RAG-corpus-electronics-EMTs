The optical coupler is suitable for frequencies in the low megahertz range. The photodiode type 
shown above can handle only small currents; however, other types of couplers, combining 
phototransistors with the SCR, can be used where more output is required. Optical couplers are replacing 
transformers in low-voltage and low-current applications. Sensitive digital circuits can use the coupler to 
control large current and voltages with low-voltage logic levels.
