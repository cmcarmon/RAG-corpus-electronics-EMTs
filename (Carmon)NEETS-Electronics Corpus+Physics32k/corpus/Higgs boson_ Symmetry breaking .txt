By the early 1960s, physicists had realised that a given symmetry law might not always be followed under certain conditions, at least in some areas of physics. Symmetry breaking can also lead to surprising and unexpected results. In 1962 physicist Philip Anderson – an expert in superconductivity – wrote a paper that built upon work by Yoichiro Nambu that considered "broken symmetries" in superconductivity and in particle physics. Anderson suggested that "broken symmetries" might be the missing piece needed to solve the problems of gauge invariance in particle physics. If electroweak symmetry was somehow being broken, it might explain why electromagnetism's boson is massless, yet the weak force bosons have mass, and solve the problems. Shortly afterwards, in 1963, this was shown to be theoretically possible, at least for some limited cases.
