High-intensity discharge or ﬂuorescent luminaires for high-bay lighting may be enclosed, ventilated open,
or  nonventilated  open.  Enclosed  luminaires  are  usually  of  a  heavy-duty  type  with  a  gasketed  glass  cover  to
protect the reﬂector and light source from collection of dirt. The initial luminaire efﬁciency is lower and the
equipment is more costly. Ventilated-open luminaires have largely replaced the nonventilated type.
