generator and detector are required. When inductance is being measured in ac or dc, it should be realized
that iron-core inductors are sensitive to current variations. Quantitative measurements of dc effects can be
made by supplying current to the unknown inductor through the EXT BIAS terminal. Use the following
steps to make inductance measurements:
