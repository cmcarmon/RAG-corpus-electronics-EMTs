Although the information is usually viewed on a display screen (cathode-ray tube), printed (hard) 
copies can be obtained. Today, hard copy output from SNAP can be sent to higher authorities in lieu of 
written reports. In the future, these hard copy transmittals may be replaced by disks or tapes containing 
the same data. In some cases, the shipboard computers will have an extra telephone wire to the pier or 
tender, and information can be exchanged electronically.
