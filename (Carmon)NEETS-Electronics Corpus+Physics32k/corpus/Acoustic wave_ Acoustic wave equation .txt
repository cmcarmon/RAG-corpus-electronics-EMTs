For lossy media, more intricate models need to be applied in order to take into account frequency-dependent attenuation and phase speed. Such models include acoustic wave equations that incorporate fractional derivative terms, see also the acoustic attenuation article.
D'Alembert gave the general solution for the lossless wave equation. For sound pressure, a solution would be
