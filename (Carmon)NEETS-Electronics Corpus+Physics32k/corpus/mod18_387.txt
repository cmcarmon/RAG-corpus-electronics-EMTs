AGC CIRCUITS and FAST-TIME-CONSTANT CIRCUITS. A gated agc circuit permits signals that
occur only in a very short time interval to develop the agc. If large-amplitude pulses from a jamming
transmitter arrive at the radar receiver at any time other than during the gating period, the agc does not
respond to these jamming pulses.
