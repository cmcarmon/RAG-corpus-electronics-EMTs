Poincaré maps can be interpreted as a discrete dynamical system. The stability of a periodic orbit of the original system is closely related to the stability of the fixed point of the corresponding Poincaré map.
Let (R, M, φ) be a differentiable dynamical system with periodic orbit γ through p. Let




P
:
U
→
S


{\displaystyle P:U\to S}

be the corresponding Poincaré map through p. We define





P

:=
i

d

U




{\displaystyle P^{0}:=id_{U}}






P

P

{\displaystyle P^{n+1}:=P\circ P^{n}}

and




P

{\displaystyle P(n,x):=P^{n}(x)}

then (Z, U, P) is a discrete dynamical system with state space U and evolution function

Per definition this system has a fixed point at p.
The periodic orbit γ of the continuous dynamical system is stable if and only if the fixed point p of the discrete dynamical system is stable.
The periodic orbit γ of the continuous dynamical system is asymptotically stable if and only if the fixed point p of the discrete dynamical system is asymptotically stable.
