Noise analysis is performed by including noise sources in the models. Typical noise sources include thermal

noise in resistors 
 is the bandwidth of the circuit. These noise sources
temperature in Kelvins, 
) into the AC model. The resulting current due to the noise
are inserted as independent current sources, In
source is then calculated at a user-speciÔ¨Åed summation node(s) by multiplying by the gain function between
the noise source and the summation node 
). This procedure is repeated for each noise source and then
the contributions at the reference node are root mean squared (RMS) summed to give the total noise at the
reference  node.  The  equivalent  input  noise  is  then  easily  calculated  from  the  transfer  function  between  the
circuit input and the reference node
