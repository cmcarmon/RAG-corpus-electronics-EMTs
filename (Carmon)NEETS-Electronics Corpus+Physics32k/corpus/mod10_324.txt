Because the existence of the ionosphere is directly related to radiations emitted from the sun, the 
movement of the Earth about the sun or changes in the sun's activity will result in variations in the 
ionosphere. These variations are of two general types: (1) those which are more or less regular and occur 
in cycles and, therefore, can be predicted in advance with reasonable accuracy, and (2) those which are 
irregular as a result of abnormal behavior of the sun and, therefore, cannot be predicted in advance. Both 
regular and irregular variations have important effects on radio wave propagation.
