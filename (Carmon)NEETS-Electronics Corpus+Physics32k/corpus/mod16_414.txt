Another consideration in the circuit voltage test is the resistance and current in the circuit. A low
resistance in a high-current circuit could result in considerable voltage drop, whereas the same resistance
in a low-current circuit may be minimal. Abnormal resistance in part of a circuit can be checked with
either an ohmmeter or a voltmeter. Where practical, an ohmmeter should be used because the test is then
carried out with a "dead" circuit.
