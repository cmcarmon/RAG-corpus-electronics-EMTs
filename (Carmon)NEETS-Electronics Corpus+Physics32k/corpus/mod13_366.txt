The simplest form of a clock is the astable or free-running multivibrator. A schematic diagram of a
typical free-running multivibrator is shown in figure 3-20 along with its output waveforms. This
multivibrator circuit is called free running because it alternates between two different output voltages
during the time it is active. Outputs 1 and 2 will be equal and opposite since Q1 and Q2 conduct
alternately. The frequency of the outputs may be altered within certain limits by varying the values of
R2C1 and R3C2. You may want to review the operation of the astable multivibrator in NEETS, Module 9,
Introduction to Wave-Generation and Wave-Shaping Circuits. Although the astable multivibrator circuit
seems to produce a good, balanced square wave, it lacks the frequency stability necessary for some types
of equipment.
