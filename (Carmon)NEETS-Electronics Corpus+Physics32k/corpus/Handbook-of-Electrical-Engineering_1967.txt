Computer-Aided Design
With progress in the theory of architectures, the computer-aided design (CAD) systems for DSP application
also become more powerful. In early 1980, the Ô¨Årst silicon compiler system for signal processing was developed
at the University of Edinburgh and was referred to as the FIRST design system. This system only addressed the
computer-aided  design  of  bit-serial  signal  processing  systems.  Since  then  more  powerful  systems  have  been
developed. The Cathedral I system from Katholieke Universiteit Leuven and the BSSC (bit-serial silicon com-
piler) from GE Research Center in Schenectady, New York, also addressed synthesis of bit-serial circuits. The
Cathedral system has now gone through many revisions, and the new versions can systhesize parallel multi-
processor data paths and can perform more powerful scheduling and allocation. The Lager design tool at the
University of California at Berkeley was developed to synthesize the DSP algorithms using parametrizable macro
building  blocks  (such  as ALU,  RAM,  ROM).  This  system  has  also  gone  through  many  revisions.  The  Hyper
system also developed at the University of California at Berkeley and the MARS design system developed at
the University of Minnesota at Minneapolis perform higher level transformations and perform scheduling and
allocation. These CAD tools are crucial to rapid prototyping of high-performance DSP integrated circuits.
