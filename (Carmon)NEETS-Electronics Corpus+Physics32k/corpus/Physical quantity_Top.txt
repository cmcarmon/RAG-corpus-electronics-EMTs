A physical quantity is a physical property of a phenomenon, body, or substance, that can be quantified by measurement. A physical quantity can be expressed as the combination of a magnitude expressed by a number – usually a real number – and a unit:



n
u


{\textstyle nu}
where



n


{\textstyle n}
is the magnitude and



u


{\textstyle u}
is the unit. For example, 1.6749275×10−27 kg (the mass of the neutron), or 299792458 metres per second (the speed of light). The same physical quantity



x


{\textstyle x}
can be represented equivalently in many unit systems, i.e.



x
=

n

1



u

=

n

2



u

{\textstyle x=n_{1}u_{1}=n_{2}u_{2}}
