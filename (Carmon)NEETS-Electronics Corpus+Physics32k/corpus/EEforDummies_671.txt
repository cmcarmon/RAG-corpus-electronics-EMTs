▶✓ Digital ICs: These ICs contain circuits that process digital signals, which 
are patterns consisting of just two voltage (or current) levels represent-
ing binary digital data, for instance, on/off, high/low, or 1/0. (I discuss 
digital data a bit more in the next section.) Such circuits are known 
as digital circuits. Some digital ICs, such as microprocessors, contain 
 millions — or billions — of tiny circuits in just a few square millimeters.
