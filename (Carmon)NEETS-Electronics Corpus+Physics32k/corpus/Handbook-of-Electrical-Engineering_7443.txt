Simulation,  useful  as  it  is,  does  have  limitations.  It  must  be  remembered  that  a  system  simulation  is  an
approximation to the actual system under study. The nature of the approximations must be understood if one
is  to  have  conﬁdence  in  the  simulation  results.  The  accuracy  of  the  simulation  is  limited  by  the  accuracy  to
which the various components and subsystems within the system are modeled. It is often necessary to collect
extensive  experimental  data  on  system  components  to  ensure  that  simulation  models  accurately  reﬂect  the
behavior of the components. Even if this step is done with care, one can only trust the simulation model over
the  range  of  values  consistent  with  the  previously  collected  experimental  data.  A  main  source  of  error  in  a
simulation results because models are used at operating points beyond which the models are valid.
