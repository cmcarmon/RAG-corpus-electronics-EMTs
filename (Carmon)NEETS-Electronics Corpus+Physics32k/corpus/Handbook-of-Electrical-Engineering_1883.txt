Many  early  video  processors  were  vector  machines  because  vector  units  provide  high  throughput  with
relatively small amounts of hardware. Today, most VSPs today make use of very-long instruction word (VLIW)
processor technology, as shown in Fig. 17.28. The architecture has several function units connected to a single
register ﬁle. The operations on all the function units are controlled by the instruction decoder based on the
current instruction. A VLIW machine differs from a SIMD machine in two important ways. First, the VLIW
machine connects all function units to the same register ﬁle, while the SIMD machine uses separate registers
for the function units. The common register ﬁle gives the VLIW machine much more ﬂexibility; for example,
a data value can be used on one function unit on one cycle and on another function unit on the next cycle
without having to copy the value. Second, the function units in the VLIW machine need not perform the same
operation. The instruction is divided into ﬁelds, one for each unit. Under control of its instruction ﬁeld, each
instruction unit can request data from the register ﬁle and perform operations as required.
