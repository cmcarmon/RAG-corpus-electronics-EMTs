The Navy uses switches in a number of ways. A typical aircraft could have over 250 switches to
control lights, electronic systems, and to indicate whether the landing gear is up or down. Ships, fire
control systems, and missile launchers are also controlled by electrical switches. In fact, almost all
electrical or electronic devices will have at least one switch.
