An electron can be accelerated or decelerated by an electrostatic field. Figure 2-2 shows an electron 
moving in an electrostatic field. The direction of travel (shown by the heavy arrow) is against the 
electrostatic lines of force which are from positive to negative. The negatively charged electron will be 
attracted to the positively charged body and will increase in velocity. As its velocity increases, the energy 
level of the electron will also increase. Where does the electron acquire its additional energy? The only 
logical source is from the electrostatic field. Thus, the conclusion is clear. An electron traveling in a 
direction opposite to electrostatic lines of force will absorb energy and increase in velocity (accelerate).
