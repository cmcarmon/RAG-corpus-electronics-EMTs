Token Ring: FDDI, FFOL
Figure  71.8  illustrates  a  ring  network.  The  real  topology  may  be  a  good  deal  more  irregular  than  a  circle,
depending on the accessibility of stations. In its usual application, which uses a token-ring protocol for media
access, an electronic repeater that operates at the aggregate network rate is required at each station.
