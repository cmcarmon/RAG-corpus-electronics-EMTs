In the limit as v ≪ c, the de Sitter group contracts to the Newton–Hooke group. This has the effect that in the nonrelativistic limit, objects in de Sitter space have an extra "repulsion" from the origin: objects have a tendency to move away from the center with an outward pointing fictitious force proportional to their distance from the origin.
While it looks as though this might pick out a preferred point in space—the center of repulsion, it is more subtly isotropic. Moving to the uniformly accelerated frame of reference of an observer at another point, all accelerations appear to have a repulsion center at the new point.
What this means is that in a spacetime with non-vanishing curvature, gravity is modified from Newtonian gravity. At distances comparable to the radius of the space, objects feel an additional linear repulsion from the center of coordinates.
