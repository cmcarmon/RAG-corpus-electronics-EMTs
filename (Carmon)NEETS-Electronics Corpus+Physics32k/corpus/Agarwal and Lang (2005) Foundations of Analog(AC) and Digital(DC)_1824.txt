12.12 SUMMARY
(cid:1) The primary goal of this chapter was to examine the behavior of second-
order circuits, primarily circuits containing at least one capacitor and one
inductor. To analyze these and other second-order circuits we again relied
on the node method of analysis. The mechanics of this analysis were essen-
tially unchanged from Chapter 10, except for the details of the solution of
second-order, as opposed to first-order, differential equations.
