Next, let us consider an arbitrary low-pass signal x(t) with the typical amplitude spectrum
of Figure 14.2.3(a). The amplitude spectrum of the modulated wave xc(t) will now have two
sidebands (lower and upper sidebands), each of width W on either side of fc, as illustrated in
Figure 14.2.3(b). Thus, we have a signal that can be transmitted over a bandpass system with a
minimum bandwidth of
