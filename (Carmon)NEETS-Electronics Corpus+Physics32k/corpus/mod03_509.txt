The number of poles and throws of a switch can be determined from markings on the switch itself.
The switch case will be marked with a schematic diagram of the switch or letters such as SPST for
single-pole, single-throw. The voltage and current ratings will also be marked on the switch. The number
of breaks can be determined from the schematic marked on the switch or by counting the terminals after
you have determined the number of poles and throws. The type of actuator, number of positions, the
momentary and locked positions of the switch can all be determined by looking at the switch and
switching it to all the positions.
