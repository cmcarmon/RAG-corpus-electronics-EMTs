Electromagnetics is the scientiﬁc discipline that deals with electric and magnetic sources and the ﬁelds these
sources  produce  in  speciﬁed  environments.  Maxwell’s  equations  provide  the  starting  point  for  the  study  of
electromagnetic  problems,  together  with  certain  principles  and  theorems  such  as  superposition,  reciprocity,
equivalence, induction, duality, linearity, and uniqueness, derived therefrom [Stratton, 1941; Harrington, 1961].
While a variety of specialized problems can be identiﬁed, a common ingredient of essentially all of them is that
of establishing a quantitative relationship between a cause (forcing function or input) and its effect (the response
, the computational characteristics of which
or output), a relationship which we refer to as a 
are determined by the mathematical form used to describe it.
