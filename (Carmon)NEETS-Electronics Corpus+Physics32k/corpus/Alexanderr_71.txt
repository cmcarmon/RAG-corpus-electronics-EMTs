Solution:
Since  there  are  four  elements  in  the  circuit,  the  circuit  has  four
,  and  2  A.  The  circuit  has  three  nodes  as
branches:  10  V, 
resistor  is  in  series  with  the  10-V
identiﬁed  in  Fig.  2.13.  The  5-
⍀
voltage source because the same current would ﬂow in both. The 6-
resistor  is  in  parallel  with  the  2-A current  source  because  both  are
connected to the same nodes 2 and 3.
