To figure out the range of time periods that the 555 timer generates, first use 
47,000 for R2 (47 kΩ) and 0.0000047 for C1 (4.7 μF) in the equation for T. Then 
calculate the low end of the timing interval by using 0 for R1 in the equation, 
and calculate the high end of the timing interval by using 1,000,000 for R1 in 
the equation. You should expect the timing interval to range from roughly 
0.3 seconds to 3.6 seconds as you dial the pot from 0 Ω to 1 MΩ.
