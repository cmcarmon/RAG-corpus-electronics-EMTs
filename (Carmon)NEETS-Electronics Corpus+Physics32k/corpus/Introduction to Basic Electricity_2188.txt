A single piece of wire produces a magnetic field 
with no north or south pole and little strength or 
practical value. If the wire is twisted into a loop, three 
things occur: (1) The flux lines are brought together. 
(2) The flux lines are concentrated at the center of the 
loop. (3) North and south poles are established. This is 
the principle of the electromagnet.
