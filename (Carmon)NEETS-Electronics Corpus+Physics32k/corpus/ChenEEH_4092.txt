We now focus on the transmission of digital data over a base-
band channel. Digital data have a broad spectrum with a
signiﬁcant low-frequency content. Baseband transmission of
digital data requires the use of a low-pass channel with a
bandwidth large enough to include the essential frequency
content of the data stream. The channel is dispersive in that
its frequency response deviates from that of an ideal low-pass
ﬁlter. The result of data transmission over such a channel is
that each received pulse is affected somewhat by adjacent
pulses, thereby giving rise to intersymbol interference (ISI).
ISI is a major source of bit errors in the reconstructed data
stream at the receiver output. Another source of bit errors in a
baseband data transmission system is the ubiquitous channel
noise. Noise and ISI arise in the system simultaneously.
