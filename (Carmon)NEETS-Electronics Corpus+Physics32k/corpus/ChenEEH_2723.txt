We begin our discussion of numerical dispersion with an
analysis of the two-dimensional TMz; mode, assuming for
simplicity no electric or magnetic loss. (It can easily be
shown that the same results are obtained for the TEz mode.)
The analysis procedure involves substitution of a plane, mono-
chromatic, and sinusoidal traveling-wave mode into equations
9.21a through 9.21c. After algebraic manipulation, an equation
is derived that relates the numerical wavevector components,
the wave frequency, the time step, and the grid space incre-
ments. This equation, the numerical dispersion relation, can be
solved for a variety of grid discretizations, wavevectors, and
wave frequencies to illustrate the principal nonphysical results
associated with numerical dispersion.
