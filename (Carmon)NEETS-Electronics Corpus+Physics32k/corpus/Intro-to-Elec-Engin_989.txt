Figure 12.2.1 shows an elementary single-phase, two-pole synchronous machine. In al-
most all cases, the armature winding of a synchronous machine is on the stator and the ﬁeld
winding is on the rotor, because it is constructionally advantageous to have the low-power
ﬁeld winding on the rotating member. The ﬁeld winding is excited by direct current, which
is supplied by a dc source connected to carbon brushes bearing on slip rings (or collector
rings). The armature windings, though distributed in the slots around the inner periphery of
the stator in an actual machine, are shown in Figure 12.2.1(a) for simplicity as consisting
of a single coil of N turns, indicated in cross section by the two sides a and −a placed in
diametrically opposite narrow slots. The conductors forming these coil sides are placed in
slots parallel to the machine shaft and connected in series by means of the end connections.
The coil in Figure 12.2.1(a) spans 180° (or a complete pole pitch, which is the peripheral
distance from the centerline of a north pole to the centerline of an adjacent south pole) and
is hence known as a full-pitch coil. For simplicity and convenience, Figure 12.2.1(a) shows
only a two-pole synchronous machine with salient-pole construction; the ﬂux paths are shown
by dashed lines. Figure 12.2.1(b) illustrates a nonsalient-pole or cylindrical-rotor construc-
tion. The stator winding details are not shown and the ﬂux paths are indicated by dashed
lines.
