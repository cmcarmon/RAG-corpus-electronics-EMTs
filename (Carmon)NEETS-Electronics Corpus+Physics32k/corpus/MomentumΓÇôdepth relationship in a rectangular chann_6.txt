Figure 2 depicts a hydraulic jump. A hydraulic jump is a region of rapidly varied flow and is formed in a channel when a supercritical flow transitions into a subcritical flow. This change in flow type is manifested as an abrupt change in the flow depth from the shallower, faster-moving supercritical flow to the deeper, slower-moving subcritical flow. Assuming no additional drag forces, momentum is conserved.
A jump causes the water surface to rise abruptly, and as a result, surface rollers are formed, intense mixing occurs, air is entrained, and usually a large amount of energy is dissipated. For these reasons, in engineered systems a hydraulic jump is sometimes forced in an attempt to dissipate flow energy, to mix chemicals, or to act as an aeration device.
The law of conservation of momentum states that the total momentum of a closed system of objects (which has no interactions with external agents) is constant. Despite the fact that there is an energy loss, momentum across a hydraulic jump is still conserved. This means that the flow depth on either side of the jump will have the same momentum, and in this way, if the momentum and flow depth on either side of the jump is known, it is possible to determine the depth on the other side of the jump. These paired depths are known as sequent depths, or conjugate depths. The latter is valid unless the jump is caused by an external force or outside influence.

The green box in Figure 2 represents the control volume enclosing the jump system and shows the major pressure forces on the system (FP1 and FP2). As this system is considered to be horizontal (or nearly horizontal) and frictionless, the horizontal components of force that normally exist due to friction (Ff) and the weight of water from a sloping channel (Fw) are neglected. It is worth to noting that the slope of the triangular hydrostatic pressure distributions on each location corresponds to the specific weight of water (Î³), which has units of (m/L2t2)
