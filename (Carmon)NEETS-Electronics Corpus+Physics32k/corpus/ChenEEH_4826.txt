these concepts, consider an object-
oriented model of a typical ﬂight control system. The ﬂight
control consists of a low-level stability augmentation control as
well as a high-level control, such as guidance, and each one
may have a dedicated processor. There are many sensors on
board such as a GPS, altimeter, and an IMU. The actuators
are the servomechanisms that drive the control surfaces (the
ailerons, the rudder, and the elevator). The object-oriented
modeling method subdivides the ﬂight controls into compo-
nents as shown in Figure 14.2. Each bubble represents an
object (or more generally, a component). Some of the com-
ponents consist of only software (such as the controllers), one
component consists of physical features (the vehicle dynam-
