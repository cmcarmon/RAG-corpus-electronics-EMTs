ampliﬁer is so designed that it provides an output signal containing a term proportional to the
derivative of the input, as well as one proportional to the input itself, error-rate damping will be
introduced. For the system that includes error rate, the only modiﬁcation needed is in the transfer
function of the servoampliﬁer. Instead of the gain Ka, the new transfer function will be Ka + sKe,
where Ke denotes the error-rate gain factor of the ampliﬁer. The complete block diagram is shown
in Figure 16.2.11. In this case the direct transmission function becomes
