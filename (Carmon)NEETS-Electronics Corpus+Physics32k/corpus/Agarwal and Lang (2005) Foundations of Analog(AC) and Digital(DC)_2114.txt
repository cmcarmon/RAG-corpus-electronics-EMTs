To gain some insight about how the circuit in Figure 15.4 is working, we first
need a circuit model that approximates the Op Amp behavior illustrated in the
data in Figure 15.3. On the basis of the preceding chapters, we are led to assign
node voltages as in Figure 15.3a, and apply KCL to the circuit. The current
law equation turns out to be not very helpful, but it is important to understand
why, so we proceed. From Figure 15.3a,
