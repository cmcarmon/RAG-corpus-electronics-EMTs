FIGURE  113.32 A  typical  PEMF
signal (signal A of Table 113.2). (A)
Magnetic ﬁeld versus time. (B) Elec-
tric ﬁeld ((cid:181) ¶B/¶t) versus time. Sig-
nal  consists  of  15  pulse  bursts  per
second.  Each  burst  is  4.5  ms  long
and contains 20 pulses. In each pulse
the magnetic ﬁeld increases from 0
to  approx.  2  mT  during  200  ms,
decreases  to  0  again  during  23  ms,
and is equal to 0 for 2 ms before the
next 225-ms sequence begins.
