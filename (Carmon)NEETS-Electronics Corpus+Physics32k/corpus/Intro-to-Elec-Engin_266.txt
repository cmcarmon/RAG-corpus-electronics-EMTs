(3.3.4)
By recalling that vL = L diL/dt and iC = C dvC /dt and the principle of continuity of the inductor
) in Equation (3.3.4) is that the
current and the capacitor voltage, the signiÔ¨Åcance of the term f (0
initial condition is automatically included in the Laplace transform of the derivative, and hence
