As seen from the i–v characteristic, a zener diode approximates an ideal diode in the forward
region. However, when the reverse bias exceeds the zener voltage VZ, the diode starts to conduct
in the reverse direction and acts like a small reverse resistance RZ in series with a battery VZ. Zener
diodes are available with values of VZ in the range of 2 to 200 V. The circuit model of Figure
7.2.7(c) incorporates two ideal diodes, Df and Dr, to reﬂect the forward and reverse characteristics
of the zener diode. The i–v curve thus has two breakpoints, one for each ideal diode, and three
straight-line segments.
