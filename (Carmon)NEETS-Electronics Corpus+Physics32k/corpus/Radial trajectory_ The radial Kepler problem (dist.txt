The problem of finding the separation of two bodies at a given time, given their separation and velocity at another time, is known as the Kepler problem. This section solves the Kepler problem for radial orbits.
The first step is to determine the constant w. Use the sign of w to determine the orbit type.

Where

{\displaystyle \textstyle x_{0}}
and





v

{\displaystyle \textstyle v_{0}}
are the separation and velocity at any time.
