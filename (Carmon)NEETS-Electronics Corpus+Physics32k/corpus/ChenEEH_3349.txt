The steps involved in the numerical integration procedure for
a realistic large system are similar to the outline above for the
simple system. The models are of very large dimensions for real-
size power systems. Hence, the formulation of the prefault,
fault-on, and postfault models becomes a nontrivial task, and
the numerical integration becomes highly time-consuming.
