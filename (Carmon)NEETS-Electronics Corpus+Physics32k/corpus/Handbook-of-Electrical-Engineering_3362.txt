Y-junction. An electrically controlled differential phase shift is then introduced by the phase modulator, and
the two optical signals are recombined in the second Y-junction. If the two signals are exactly in phase, then
they recombine to excite the lowest-order mode of the output waveguide and the intensity modulator is turned
fully on. If instead there exists a p-phase shift between the two signals, then they recombine to form the second
mode, which is radiated into the substrate and the modulator is turned fully off. Contrast ratios greater than
25  dB  (300:1)  are  routinely  achieved  in  commercial  devices.  The  transfer  function  for  the  Machâ€“Zehnder
modulator can be expressed as
