In 1971, magnetic tape became popular again when the 3M Company introduced the first 1/4-inch
magnetic tape cartridge and tape drive. In that same year, IBM invented the 8-inch floppy disk and disk
drive. It used a flexible 8-inch platter of the same material as magnetic tape. Its main goal was to replace
punched cards as a program-loading device.
