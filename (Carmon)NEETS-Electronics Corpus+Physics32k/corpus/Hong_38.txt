From the above equation, it is possible to see that the impedance of a capacitor is 
a frequency-dependent resistance that is inversely proportional to frequency; ZC is small 
at high frequency and large at low frequency. At DC, the impedance of a capacitor is 
infinite. The impedance expression also indicates that for a sinusoidal input, the current 
in a capacitor lags its voltage by a phase of 90o.
