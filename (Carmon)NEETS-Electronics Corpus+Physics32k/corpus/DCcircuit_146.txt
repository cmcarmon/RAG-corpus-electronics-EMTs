Just as in the case of the diesel tractor engine and the motorcycle engine, a circuit with
high voltage and low current may be dissipating the same amount of power as a circuit with
low voltage and high current. Neither the amount of voltage alone nor the amount of current
alone indicates the amount of power in an electric circuit.
