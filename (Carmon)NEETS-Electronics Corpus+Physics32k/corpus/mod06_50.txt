Remember, Edison's bulb had a vacuum so the filament would glow without burning. Also, the space
between the filament and plate was relatively small. The electrons emitted from the filament did not have
far to go to reach the plate. Thus, the positive charge on the plate was able to attract the negative
electrons.
