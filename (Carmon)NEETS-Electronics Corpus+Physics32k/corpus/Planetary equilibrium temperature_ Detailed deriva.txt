The power absorbed by the planet from the star is equal to the power emitted by the planet:

{\displaystyle {P}_{in}={P}_{out}}

The power input to the planet is equal to the solar irradiance (i.e. power received per unit area) of the star at the distance of the planet, Io, times the fraction absorbed by the planet (1 minus the albedo), times the area of the planet illuminated by the star:

{\displaystyle {P}_{in}={I_{o}}\left(1-a\right)\pi {{R}_{p}}^{2}}

Io, the solar intensity at the distance of the planet from the sun, is equal to the luminosity (i.e. total power emitted) of the star divided by the area of the sphere that all of the star's radiation is cast on at the distance of the planet. This yields:

Any incoming power to a black body is radiated as heat according to the Stefan–Boltzmann law

(The emissivity



ϵ


{\displaystyle \epsilon }
is usually expected to be very close to 1, and thus is often left out). Multiplying by the area, the power emitted by the planet is:

{\displaystyle {T}_{eq}={\left({\frac {{L}_{\bigodot }\left(1-a\right)}{16\epsilon \sigma \pi {D}^{2}}}\right)}^{1/4}}

The luminosity of the star is equal to the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, times the area of the star, times the fourth power of the temperature of the star:

By assuming that the emissivity



ϵ


{\displaystyle \epsilon }
is equal to 1, this reproduces the equation in the previous section. It is interesting to note that the equilibrium temperature does not depend on the size of the planet, because both the incoming radiation and outgoing radiation depend on the area of the planet.
