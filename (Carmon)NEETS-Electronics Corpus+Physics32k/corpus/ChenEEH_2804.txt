The system of 9.117 equations can be discretized on the
standard Yee lattice. It is suitable to use normal leapfrogging
in time wherein the loss terms are time-averaged according to
the semi-implicit scheme. This leads to explicit time-stepping
expressions for Dx, Dy, and Dz. For example, the Dx update is
given by:
