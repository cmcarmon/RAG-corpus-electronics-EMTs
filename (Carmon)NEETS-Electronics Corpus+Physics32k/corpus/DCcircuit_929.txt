Even though there are now two strain gauges in the bridge circuit, only one is responsive
to mechanical strain, and thus we would still refer to this arrangement as a quarter-bridge.
However, if we were to take the upper strain gauge and position it so that it is exposed to the
opposite force as the lower gauge (i.e. when the upper gauge is compressed, the lower gauge
will be stretched, and vice versa), we will have both gauges responding to strain, and the bridge
will be more responsive to applied force. This utilization is known as a half-bridge. Since both
strain gauges will either increase or decrease resistance by the same proportion in response
to changes in temperature, the effects of temperature change remain canceled and the circuit
will suffer minimal temperature-induced measurement error:
