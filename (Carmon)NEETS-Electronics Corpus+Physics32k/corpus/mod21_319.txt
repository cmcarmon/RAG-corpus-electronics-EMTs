One of the most elementary precautions concerning the use of a bridge, when measuring low 
resistance, is to tighten the binding posts securely so that the contact resistance between the binding posts 
and the resistance to be measured is minimum. Leakage paths between the resistor leads along the outside 
surface of the resistor body must be avoided when resistances greater than 0.1 megohm are measured. 
Search for defective solder joints or broken strands in stranded wire leads; these defects can cause erratic 
galvanometer indications. In those cases where wire leads must be used to reach from the resistance under 
test to the bridge terminals, measure the ohmic value of those leads prior to further measurements.
