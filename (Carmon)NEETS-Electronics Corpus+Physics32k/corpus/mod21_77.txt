An ohmmeter consists of a galvanometer, batteries, and resistors of known value that are connected
in such a way that unknown resistors to be measured are compared with standard values. Figure 1-10
illustrates three basic ohmmeter circuits: (A) single range type, (B) series multirange type, and (C) shunt
type.
