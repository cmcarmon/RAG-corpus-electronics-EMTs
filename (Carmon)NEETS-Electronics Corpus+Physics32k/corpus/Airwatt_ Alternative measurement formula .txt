{\displaystyle P={\frac {1}{8.5}}\cdot {\text{airflow}}[CFM]\cdot {\text{suction}}[{\text{inches of water}}]}

CFM is always given statistically at its maximum which is at a 2-inch (51 mm) opening. Waterlift, on the other hand, is always given at its maximum – a 0-inch opening. When waterlift is at a 0-inch opening, then the flow rate is zero – no air is moving, thus the power is also 0 airwatts. So one then needs to analyse the curve created by both flow rate and waterlift as the opening changes from 0 to 2 inches (0 to 51 mm); somewhere along this line the power will attain its maximum.
If the flow rate were given in litres per second (L/s) instead of cubic metres per second (m3/s), then the pressure would be in kilopascals (kPa). Thus one watt equals one kilopascal times one litre per second:
