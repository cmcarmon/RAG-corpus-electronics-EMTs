One simple way to realize conjugation is to apply the iterations. The idea of this approach is that each solution for the body or for the fluid produces a boundary condition for other components of the system. The process starts by assuming that one of conjugate conditions exists on the interface. Then, one solves the problem for body or for fluid applying the guessing boundary condition and uses the result as a boundary condition for solving a set of equations for another component, and so on. If this process converges, the desired accuracy may be achieved. However, the rate of convergence highly depends on the first guessing condition, and there is no way to find a proper one, except through trial and error.
Another numerical conjugate procedure is grounded on the simultaneous solution of a large set of governing equations for both subdomains and conjugate conditions. Patankar [10] proposed a method and software for such solutions using one generalized expression for continuously computing the velocities and temperature fields through the whole problem domain while satisfying the conjugate boundary conditions.
