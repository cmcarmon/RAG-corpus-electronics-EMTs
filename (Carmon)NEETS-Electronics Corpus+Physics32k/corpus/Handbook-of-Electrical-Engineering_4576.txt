Modeling  uncertainties  can  be  assigned  to  two  basic  error  categories,  a  physical modeling error eP  and  a
numerical modeling error eN as outlined in Table 45.12. The former is due to the fact that for most problems
of practical interest varying degrees of approximation are needed in developing a simpliﬁed or idealized problem
representation that will be compatible with the computer code to be used for the modeling computations. The
latter is due to the fact that the numerical results obtained are almost invariably only approximate solutions to
that  idealized  representation.  We  note  that  although  an  analytical  expression  may  in  principle  represent  a
formally exact solution, the process of obtaining numerical results in that case is still one that inevitably involves
ﬁnite-precision evaluation of the formal solution.
