. Encapsulation refers to objects being self-contained
modules with well-deﬁned interfaces
for interaction
with other objects. The variables used in an object are
generally limited in scope so that they are not accessible
outside of the object (unless they are speciﬁcally declared
as ‘‘public’’ variables). An object’s interface that allows it
to interact with the outside world is kept constant even as
the internal workings may be modiﬁed and updated, so
modiﬁcation to one object does not require correspond-
ing modiﬁcations to other objects. This encapsulation
property enables software updates to be accomplished
more efﬁciently and with less risk of error.
