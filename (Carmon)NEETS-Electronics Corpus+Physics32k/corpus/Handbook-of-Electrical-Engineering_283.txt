The network shown in Fig. 3.7 has two independent meshes. They
are labeled I1 and I2, as shown. If the mesh currents are known to be
I1  =  7  A  and  I2  =  5/2  A,  then  all  voltages  in  the  network  can  be
calculated. For example, the voltage V1, i.e., the voltage across the 1-W
resistor, is V1 = –I1R = –(7)(1) = –7 V. Likewise V = (I1 – I2)R = (7 –5/2)(2) = 9 V. Furthermore, we can check
our analysis by showing that KVL is satisﬁed around every mesh. Starting at the lower left-hand corner and
applying KVL to the left-hand mesh we obtain
