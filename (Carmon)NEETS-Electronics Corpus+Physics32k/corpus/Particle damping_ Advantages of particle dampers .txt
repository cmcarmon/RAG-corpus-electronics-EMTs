They can perform through a large range of temperatures
They can survive for a long life
They can perform in a very wide range of frequencies, unlike viscoelastic dampers, which are highly frequency dependent
The particles placed inside a cavity in a structure can be less in weight than the mass they replace.
Through analyses, one can find the right kind, size and consistency of particles for the given application.
Therefore, they are suited for applications where there is a need for long service in harsh environments.
