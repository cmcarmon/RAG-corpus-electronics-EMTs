{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\mu }}_{\text{L}}=-g_{\text{L}}{\mu _{\mathrm {B} } \over \hbar }{\boldsymbol {L}},}

where μL is the magnetic moment resulting from the orbital angular momentum of an electron, L is its orbital angular momentum, and μB is the Bohr magneton. For an infinite mass nucleus, the value of gL is exactly equal to one, by a quantum-mechanical argument analogous to the derivation of the classical magnetogyric ratio. For an electron in an orbital with a magnetic quantum number ml, the z-component of the orbital angular momentum is
