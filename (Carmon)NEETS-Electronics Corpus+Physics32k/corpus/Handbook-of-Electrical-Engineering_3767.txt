Effect of the Earth
The phenomenon of multipath propagation causes signiﬁcant departures from free-space conditions. The term
multipath  denotes  the  possibility  of  EM  wave  propagation  along  various  paths  from  the  transmitter  to  the
receiver. In multipath propagation of an EM wave over the earth’s surface, two such paths exist: a direct path
and a path via reﬂection and diffractions from the interface between the atmosphere and the earth. A simpliﬁed
geometry of the multipath situation is shown in Fig. 37.4. The reﬂected and diffracted component is commonly
separated into two parts, one specular (or coherent) and the other diffuse (or incoherent), that can be separately
analyzed. The specular component is well deﬁned in terms of its amplitude, phase, and incident direction. Its
main characteristic is its conformance to Snell’s law for reﬂection, which requires that the angles of incidence
and reﬂection be equal and coplanar. It is a plane wave and, as such, is uniquely speciﬁed by its direction. The
diffuse component, however, arises out of the random nature of the scattering surface and, as such, is nonde-
terministic. It is not a plane wave and does not obey Snell’s law for reﬂection. It does not come from a given
direction but from a continuum.
