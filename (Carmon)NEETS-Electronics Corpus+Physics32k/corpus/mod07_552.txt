There are two widely used checks in testing electronic equipment, VISUAL and SIGNAL 
TRACING. The importance of the visual check should not be underestimated because many technicians 
find defects right away simply by looking for them. A visual check does not take long. In fact, you should 
be able to see the problem readily if it is the type of problem that can be seen. You should learn the 
following procedure. You could find yourself using it quite often. This procedure is not only for power 
supplies but also for any type of electronic equipment you may be troubleshooting. (Because diode and 
transistor testing was covered in chapter 1 and 2 of this module, it will not be discussed at this time. If 
you have problems in this area, refer to chapter 1 for diodes or chapter 2 for transistors.)
