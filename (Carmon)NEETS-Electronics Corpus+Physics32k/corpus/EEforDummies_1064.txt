Wet the sponge, squeezing out excess water. Turn on the soldering iron, 
wait a minute or so for it to heat up (to about 700Â°F), and then wet the tip of 
the soldering iron by briefly touching it to the sponge. If the tip is new, tin it 
before soldering to help prevent solder from sticking to the tip. (Sticky solder 
can form an ugly globule, which can wreak havoc if it falls off into your cir-
cuit.) You tin the tip by applying a small amount of molten solder to it. Then 
you wipe off any excess solder on the sponge.
