▶✓ Pink pencil eraser: Great for rubbing electrical contacts clean, espe-
cially contacts that have been contaminated by the acid from a leaky 
battery. Must be pink; other erasers can leave a hard‐to‐remove residue. 
Avoid rubbing the eraser against a circuit board because it may create 
static electricity.
