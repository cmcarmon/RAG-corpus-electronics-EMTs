When a beam of white light (sunlight) is passed through a PRISM, as shown in figure 1-18, it is
refracted and dispersed (the phenomenon is known as DISPERSION) into its component wavelengths.
Each of these wavelengths causes a different reaction of the eye, which sees the various colors that
compose the visible spectrum. The visible spectrum is recorded as a mixture of red, orange, yellow,
green, blue, indigo, and violet. White light results when the PRIMARIES (red, green, and blue) are mixed
