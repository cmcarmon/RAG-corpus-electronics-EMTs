For a processor or computer designed to simulate a neural network SUPS is measured as the product of simulated neurons



N


{\displaystyle N}
and average connectivity



c


{\displaystyle c}
(synapses) per neuron per second:




S
U
P
S
=
c
×
N


{\displaystyle SUPS=c\times N}

Depending on the type of simulation it is usual equal to the total number of synapses simulated.
In an "asynchronous" dynamic simulation if a neuron spikes at



υ


{\displaystyle \upsilon }
Hz, the average rate of synaptic updates provoked by the activity of that neuron is



υ
c
N


{\displaystyle \upsilon cN}
. In a synchronous simulation with step



Δ
t


{\displaystyle \Delta t}
the number of synaptic updates per second would be






c
N


Δ
t





{\displaystyle {\frac {cN}{\Delta t}}}
. As



Δ
t


{\displaystyle \Delta t}
has to be chosen much smaller than the average interval between two successive afferent spikes, which implies



Δ
t

υ
N





{\displaystyle \Delta t<{\frac {1}{\upsilon N}}}
, giving an average of synaptic updates equal to

{\displaystyle \upsilon cN^{2}}
. Therefore, spike-driven synaptic dynamics leads to a linear scaling of computational complexity O(N) per neuron, compared with the O(N2) in the "synchronous" case.
