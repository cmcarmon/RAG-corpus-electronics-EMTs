A compass will react to the magnetic field around a conducting wire. As the current increases, the
compass movement increases. If the current decreases, the compass movement is less. If the current
direction changes, the compass movement changes direction. PERMANENT-MAGNET
MOVING-COIL meter movement (dâ€™Arsonval movement) uses the interaction of magnetic fields to
produce movement.
