The PANDA experiment is a planned particle physics experiment at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research in Darmstadt.
PANDA will use protonâ€“antiproton annihilation to study strong interaction physics including charmonium spectroscopy and exotic states such as charmed hybrids and glueballs.
A description of the experiment is available at the scholarpedia.
