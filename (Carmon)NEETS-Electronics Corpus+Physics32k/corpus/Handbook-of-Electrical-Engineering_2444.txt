So far we have looked at the  IDS vs. VDS curve only for the case of
VGS = 0. In Fig. 24.6 a family of curves of IDS vs. VDS for various constant
values of  VGS is presented. This is called the drain characteristics, also
known as the output characteristics, since the output side of the JFET
is  usually  the  drain  side.  In  the  active  region  where  IDS  is  relatively
independent of VDS , a simple approximate equation relating IDS to VGS
is the square-law transfer equation as given by IDS = IDSS[1 – (VGS /VP)]2.
When VGS = 0, IDS = IDSS as expected, and as VGS ﬁ  V P, IDS ﬁ  0. The
lower boundary of the active region is controlled by the condition that
the channel be pinched off at  the  drain  end.  To  meet  this  condition
