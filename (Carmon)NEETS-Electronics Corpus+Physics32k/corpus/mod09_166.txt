Assume any given value of L and C. If we increase the applied frequency, XC decreases and XL 
increases. If we increase the frequency enough, the capacitor acts as a short and the inductor acts as an 
open. Of course, the opposite is also true. Decreasing frequency causes XC to increase and XL to decrease. 
Here again, if we make a large enough change, XC acts as an open and XL acts as a short. Figure 1-13 
gives a pictorial representation of these two basic components and how they respond to low and high 
frequencies.
