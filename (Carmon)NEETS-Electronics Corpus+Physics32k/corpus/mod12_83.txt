View (A) of figure 1-11 illustrates a circuit that contains a combination of linear and nonlinear 
impedances with a sine wave of voltage applied. Impedances Z2, Z3, and Z4 are linear; and Z1 is 
nonlinear. The result of a linear and nonlinear combination of impedances is a nonlinear waveform. The 
curve Z, shown in view (B), is the nonlinear curve for the circuit of view (A). Because of the nonlinear 
impedance, current can flow in the circuit only during the positive alternation of the sine-wave generator. 
If an oscilloscope is connected, as shown in view (A), the waveform across Z3 will not be a sine wave. 
Figure 1-12, view (A), illustrates the sine wave from the generator and view (B) shows the waveform 
across the linear impedance Z3. Notice that the nonlinear impedance Z1 has eliminated the negative half 
cycles.
