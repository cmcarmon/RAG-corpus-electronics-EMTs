In the remainder of this chapter, we will study the behavior of a variety of
second-order circuits similar to the one shown in Figure 12.5. We begin with the
simplest circuit involving only one capacitor and one inductor. Following that,
we study more complex circuits by including resistors and then sources. As we
shall see, there are many such second-order circuits. Fortunately, their behavior
is much the same, and so we need examine only several of them in detail. We
will also study the behavior of two-capacitor and two-inductor second-order
circuits. Finally, we close by addressing several issues of general importance to
the analysis of second-order and higher-order circuits.
