Three power sources are required for reflex klystron operation: (1) filament power, (2) positive 
resonator voltage (often referred to as beam voltage) used to accelerate the electrons through the grid gap 
of the resonant cavity, and (3) negative repeller voltage used to turn the electron beam around. The 
electrons are focused into a beam by the electrostatic fields set up by the resonator potential (B+) in the 
body of the tube. Note in figure 2-9 that the resonator potential is common to the resonator cavity, the 
accelerating grid, and the entire body of the tube.
