motors. A single-phase winding produces a standing wave,
which may be resolved into a forward and a backward rotating
wave. These waves each produce a torque versus slip curve as
shown in Figure 4.27. The net torque is the sum of the forward
and backward components. As indicated by the Ô¨Ågure, there is
no starting torque. If we can manage, however, to start the
motor (in either direction), it will continue to accelerate in
that direction. In single-phase induction motors, a starting
torque can be produced by using two stator windings situated
908 electrical distance apart. The power factor of these wind-
ings is different, producing a phase shift between the two
currents and therefore a traveling wave. Once the motor begins
to turn, one of the windings may be disconnected.
