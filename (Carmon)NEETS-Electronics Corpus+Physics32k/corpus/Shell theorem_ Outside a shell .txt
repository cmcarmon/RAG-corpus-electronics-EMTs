A solid, spherically symmetric body can be modelled as an infinite number of concentric, infinitesimally thin spherical shells. If one of these shells can be treated as a point mass, then a system of shells (i.e. the sphere) can also be treated as a point mass. Consider one such shell:

Note: dθ appearing in the diagram refers to the small angle, not the arclength. The arclength is R dθ.
Applying Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation, the sum of the forces due to mass elements in the shaded band is




d
F
=



G
m

d

.


{\displaystyle dF={\frac {Gm\;dM}{s^{2}}}.}

However, since there is partial cancellation due to the vector nature of the force, the leftover component (in the direction pointing toward m) is given by

{\displaystyle dF_{r}={\frac {Gm\;dM}{s^{2}}}\cos \phi .}

The total force on m, then, is simply the sum of the force exerted by all the bands. By shrinking the width of each band, and increasing the number of bands, the sum becomes an integral expression:





F

r


=
∫
d

F

{\displaystyle F_{r}=\int dF_{r}}

Since G and m are constants, they may be taken out of the integral:

{\displaystyle F_{r}=Gm\int {\frac {dM\cos \phi }{s^{2}}}.}

To evaluate this integral, one must first express dM as a function of dθ
The total surface of a spherical shell is

These two relations link the three parameters θ, ϕ and s that appear in the integral together. When θ increases from 0 to π radians, ϕ varies from the initial value 0 to a maximal value to finally return to zero for θ = π. s on the other hand increases from the initial value r − R to the final value r + R when θ increases from 0 to π radians. This is illustrated in the following animation:

Note: As viewed from m, the shaded blue band appears as a thin annulus whose inner and outer diameters converge to R sin θ as dθ vanishes.
To find a primitive function to the integrand, one has to make s the independent integration variable instead of θ
Performing an implicit differentiation of the second of the "cosine law" expressions above yields

{\displaystyle F_{r}={\frac {GMm}{2rR}}\int {\frac {\cos \phi }{s}}\,ds}

where the new integration variable s increases from r − R to r + R.
Inserting the expression for cos(φ) using the first of the "cosine law" expressions above, one finally gets that

A primitive function to the integrand is

{\displaystyle F_{r}={\frac {GMm}{r^{2}}},}

saying that the gravitational force is the same as that of a point mass in the centre of the shell with the same mass.
Finally, integrate all infinitesimally thin spherical shell with mass of dM, and we can obtain the total gravity contribution of a solid ball to the object outside the ball

which suggests that the gravity of a solid spherical ball to an exterior object can be simplified as that of a point mass in the centre of the ball with the same mass.
