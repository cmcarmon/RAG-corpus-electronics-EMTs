Transmitted signals next pass through the next stage, the evil channel. Nothing good happens to a
signal in a channel: It can become corrupted by noise, distorted, and attenuated among many possibilities.
The channel cannot be escaped (the real world is cruel), and transmitter design and receiver design focus
on how best to jointly fend oﬀ the channel’s eﬀects on signals. The channel is another system in our block
diagram, and produces r (t), the signal received by the receiver. If the channel were benign (good luck
ﬁnding such a channel in the real world), the receiver would serve as the inverse system to the transmitter,
and yield the message with no distortion. However, because of the channel, the receiver must do its best to
produce a received message ˆs (t) that resembles s (t) as much as possible. Shannon7 showed in his 1948 paper
that reliable—for the moment, take this word to mean error-free—digital communication was possible over
arbitrarily noisy channels. It is this result that modern communications systems exploit, and why many
communications systems are going “digital.” The module on Chapter 6, titled Information Communication,
details Shannon’s theory of information, and there we learn of Shannon’s result and how to use it.
