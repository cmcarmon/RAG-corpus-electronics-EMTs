The design space constraints of SSTO vehicles were described by rocket design engineer Robert Truax:

The Tsiolkovsky rocket equation expresses the maximum change in velocity any single rocket stage can achieve:




Δ

I

(

)


{\displaystyle \Delta v=I_{\text{sp}}\cdot g_{0}\ln(MR)}

where:




Δ
v


{\displaystyle \Delta v}
(delta-v) is the maximum change of velocity of the vehicle,





I

sp




{\displaystyle I_{\text{sp}}}
is the propellant specific impulse,





g

0




{\displaystyle g_{0}}
is the Standard Gravity,




M
R


{\displaystyle MR}
is the vehicle mass ratio,




ln


{\displaystyle \ln }
refers to the natural logarithm function.
The mass ratio of a vehicle is defined as a ratio the initial vehicle mass when fully loaded with propellants




(

{\displaystyle \left(m_{i}\right)}
to the final vehicle mass




(

m

{\displaystyle \left(m_{f}\right)}

{\displaystyle MR={\frac {m_{i}}{m_{f}}}={\frac {m_{p}+m_{s}+m_{\text{pl}}}{m_{s}+m_{\text{pl}}}}}

where:

{\displaystyle m_{i}}
is the initial vehicle mass or the gross liftoff weight

{\displaystyle \left(GLOW\right)}
,





m

{\displaystyle m_{f}}
is the final vehicle mass after the burn,





m

s




{\displaystyle m_{s}}
is the structural mass of vehicle,





m

p




{\displaystyle m_{p}}
is the propellant mass,





m

pl




{\displaystyle m_{\text{pl}}}
is the payload mass.
The propellant mass fraction (



ζ


{\displaystyle \zeta }
) of a vehicle can be expressed solely as a function of the mass ratio:

The structural coefficient (



λ


{\displaystyle \lambda }
) is a critical parameter in SSTO vehicle design. Structural efficiency of a vehicle is maximized as the structural coefficient approaches zero. The structural coefficient is defined as:




λ
=



m

{\displaystyle \lambda ={\frac {m_{s}}{m_{p}+m_{s}}}={\frac {m_{s}}{m_{i}-m_{\text{pl}}}}={\frac {\frac {m_{s}}{m_{i}}}{1-{\frac {m_{\text{pl}}}{m_{i}}}}}}

The overall structural mass fraction




(



m

s



m

i




)



{\displaystyle \left({\frac {m_{s}}{m_{i}}}\right)}
can be expressed in terms of the structural coefficient:







m

)



{\displaystyle {\frac {m_{s}}{m_{i}}}=\lambda \left(1-{\frac {m_{\text{pl}}}{m_{i}}}\right)}

An additional expression for the overall structural mass fraction can be found by noting that the payload mass fraction




(



m

pl



m

i




)



{\displaystyle \left({\frac {m_{\text{pl}}}{m_{i}}}\right)}
, propellant mass fraction and structural mass fraction sum to one:

{\displaystyle {\frac {m_{s}}{m_{i}}}=1-\zeta -{\frac {m_{\text{pl}}}{m_{i}}}}

Equating the expressions for structural mass fraction and solving for the initial vehicle mass yields:

{\displaystyle m_{i}=GLOW={\frac {m_{\text{pl}}}{1-\left({\frac {\zeta }{1-\lambda }}\right)}}}

This expression shows how the size of a SSTO vehicle is dependent on its structural efficiency. Given a mission profile




(

Δ
v
,

m

pl



)



{\displaystyle \left(\Delta v,m_{\text{pl}}\right)}
and propellant type




(

I

sp


)



{\displaystyle \left(I_{\text{sp}}\right)}
,the size of a vehicle increases with an increasing structural coefficient. This growth factor sensitivity is shown parametrically for both SSTO and two-stage-to-orbit (TSTO) vehicles for a standard LEO mission. The curves vertically asymptote at the maximum structural coefficient limit where mission criteria can no longer be met:

{\displaystyle \lambda _{\text{max}}=1-\zeta ={\frac {1}{MR}}}

In comparison to a non-optimized TSTO vehicle using restricted staging, a SSTO rocket launching an identical payload mass and using the same propellants will always require a substantially smaller structural coefficient to achieve the same delta-v. Given that current materials technology places a lower limit of approximately 0.1 on the smallest structural coefficients attainable, reusable SSTO vehicles are typically an impractical choice even when using the highest performance propellants available.
