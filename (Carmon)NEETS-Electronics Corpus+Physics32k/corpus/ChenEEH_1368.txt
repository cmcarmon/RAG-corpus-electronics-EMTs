Performance tools are an essential part of the software tool kit
for the development of parallel algorithms. These tools allow
software developers to capture empirical data on the execution
of their algorithms. These data may then be used to calibrate
and validate preconceived mathematical performance models,
to compare different algorithms, to investigate the scalability
of algorithms with a number of processors, and to identify
actual or potential bottlenecks in execution.
