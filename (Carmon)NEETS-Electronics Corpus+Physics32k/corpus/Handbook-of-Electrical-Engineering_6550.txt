Figure 71.7 includes relative unrepeatered, unampliﬁed values of rate-length products in the three transmis-
sion windows. Because of high loss, the ﬁrst window can be used only for moderate lengths (around 10 km).
Because  of  high  dispersion,  the  data  rates  are  also  limited  in  this  region.  In  the  second  window,  nearly  zero
dispersion allows high-rate transmission, but the losses limit the distance that can be covered (typically around
50 km). In the third window, the loss is about half the 1300-nm attenuation so that twice as much distance
can be covered. Dispersion-shifted ﬁber allows the same high rates as does 1300-nm operation. Repeaters and
ampliﬁers extend the useful distance of ﬁber links well beyond the distances listed here.
