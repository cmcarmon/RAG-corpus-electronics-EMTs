12.4.14 Let us consider an elementary salient-pole, two-
phase, synchronous machine with nonuniform air
gap. The schematic representation is the same
as for Problem 12.4.12. Structurally the stator
is similar to that of Figure E12.4.1 except that
this machine has two identical stator windings
in quadrature instead of one. The salient-pole
rotor with two poles carries the Ô¨Åeld winding con-
nected to slip rings. The inductances are given as
