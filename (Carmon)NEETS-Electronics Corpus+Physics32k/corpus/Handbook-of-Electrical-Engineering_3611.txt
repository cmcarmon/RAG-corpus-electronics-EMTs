Diamagnetism is caused by induced magnetic moments that tend to oppose the externally applied magnetic
ﬁeld. Paramagnetism is due to alignment of magnetic moments. When placed in an inhomogeneous magnetic
ﬁeld, a diamagnetic material tends to move toward regions of weaker magnetic ﬁeld and a paramagnetic material
toward regions of stronger magnetic ﬁeld. Ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism are highly nonlinear effects.
Ferromagnetic substances are characterized by spontaneous magnetization below the Curie temperature. The
medium also depends on the history of applied ﬁelds, and in many instances the magnetization curve forms
a  hysteresis  loop.  In  an  antiferromagnetic  material,  the  spins  form  sublattices  that  become  spontaneously
magnetized in an antiparallel arrangement below the Néel temperature.
