Electronic wattmeters are used for direct, small power measurements or for power measurements at 
frequencies beyond the range of electrodynamometer-type instruments. A simplified electronic wattmeter 
circuit is shown in figure 3-13. The matched triodes are operated in the nonlinear portion of their 
characteristic grid-voltage, plate-current curves. The symmetrical resistive T network between the 
generator and load will provide V1 and V2 voltages proportional to, and in phase with, the load current 
and voltage, respectively. A source of ac power is connected to the load through the series resistors R1 
and R2. These two resistors are of equal value and are made small to prevent the voltage drop across them 
from reducing the load voltage appreciably. R3 is made large enough to have negligible power 
consumption. Therefore, the R3 voltage is equal to the load voltage, and the voltage across either series 
resistor is proportional to the difference in the output currents of the tubes. The average value of the 
difference could be measured by a dc meter connected to read the voltage potential between the grids of 
V1 and V2. This method is adequate only at low frequencies. As the frequency increases, the stray 
capacitances and inductances also increase. The frequency range of the electronic wattmeter can be 
extended up to 20 megahertz by using pentodes instead of triode tubes. The operating conditions in a 
pentode are adjusted so that plate current is proportional to the product of a linear function of plate 
voltage and an exponential function of grid voltage.
