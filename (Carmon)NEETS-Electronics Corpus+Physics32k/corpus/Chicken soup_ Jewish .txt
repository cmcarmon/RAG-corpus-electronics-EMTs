Chicken soup is a traditional dish of the Jewish kitchen. The soup is prepared with herbs like parsley and fresh dill or thyme, was often served with knaidlach (matzah balls), kreplach (dumplings), lokshen (flat egg noodles), or mandlen (Shkedei Marak in Israel) (soup "almonds"). A traditional garnish was eyerlekh (little eggs). These unlaid chicken eggs were taken from a hen and boiled in the soup.  Modern health standards make these difficult to obtain now.
