3. Deenergize the circuit and connect the circuit as shown in view A of figure 1-40. To obtain the 78 
volts required to zero the CT, leave the S1 lead on, disconnect the S3 lead on the CT, and put the 
S2 lead (from the CX) on S3. This is necessary since 78 volts exists only between S1 and S2 or 
S2 and S3 on a properly zeroed CX. Now energize the circuit and turn the stator of the CT to 
obtain a minimum reading on the 250-volt scale. This is the coarse or approximate zero setting of 
the CT.
