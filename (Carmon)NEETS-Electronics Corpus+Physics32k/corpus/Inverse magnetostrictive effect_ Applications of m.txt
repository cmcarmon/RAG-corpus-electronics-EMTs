Magnetoelastic effect can be used in development of force sensors. This effect was used for sensors:
in civil engineering.
for monitoring of large diesel engines in locomotives.
for monitoring of ball valves.
for biomedical monitoring.
Magnetoelastic effect have to be also considered as a side effect of accidental application of mechanical stresses to the magnetic core of inductive component, e.g. fluxgates.
