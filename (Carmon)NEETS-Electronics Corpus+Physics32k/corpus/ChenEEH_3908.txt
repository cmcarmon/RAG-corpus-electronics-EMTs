Statistical signal processing is an important subject in signal
processing that enjoys a wide range of applications, including
communications, control systems, medical signal processing,
and seismology. It plays an important role in the design,
analysis, and implementation of adaptive Ô¨Ålters, such as adap-
tive equalizers in digital communication systems. It is also the
foundation of multiuser detection that is considered an effect-
ive means for mitigating multiple access interferences in
spread-spectrum based wireless communications.
