Each desktop computer has a built-in program called "bootstrap loader." When you turn the 
computer on, this program tries to load, or "boot," an external operating system from disk, usually from 
drive A, into the computer's internal memory. Disk drive B is usually used for data file disks. The term 
boot comes from the idea of pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. The computer loads a little program 
from the disk that tells it how to load a second, bigger program (the operating system). The operating 
system then tells it how to load another program (an applications program or utility program) to perform a 
specific job or function. The first thing you need to learn about using a computer is that computers and 
their programs are very particular. They require complete accuracy and attention to detail on your part. 
They are not good at guessing what you meant. You'll quickly learn there are a few things that can go 
wrong at this point, in which case the computer will give you an error message on the display screen
