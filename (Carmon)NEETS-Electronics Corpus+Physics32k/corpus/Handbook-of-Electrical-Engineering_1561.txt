State-of-the-Art Systems
In the 1998 DARPA Hub-4E English Broadcast News Benchmark Test, an overall recognition error rate of 13.5%
was achieved. This test includes recognition of baseline broadcast speech, spontaneous broadcast speech, speech
over telephone channels, speech in the presence of background music, speech under degraded acoustic conditions,
speech from non-native speakers, and all other kinds of speech. Details can be obtained from the NIST Web site.
Another benchmark test is the Switchboard Task, which is the transcription of conversations between two people
over the telephone. Error rates for this task are approximately 37%. In the Airline Travel Information System (ATIS)
speech recognition evaluation conducted by DARPA, error rates close to 2% have been obtained. High recognition
accuracies have been obtained for digit recognition, with error rates under 1% (TIMIT database [31]).
