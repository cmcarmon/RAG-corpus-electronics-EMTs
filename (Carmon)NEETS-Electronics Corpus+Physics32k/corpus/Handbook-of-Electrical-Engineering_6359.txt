The source decoder converts the reduced bit-rate audio stream back to pseudolinear at the original sampling
rate.  The  decoder  computationally  expands  the  mathematically  reduced  data  and  Ô¨Ålls  the  gaps  left  from  the
extraction of irrelevant audio information with averaged code or other masking data. The output of the source
