This  system  is  shown  in  Fig.  18.6(b). Arbitrary  speed  increase  is  possible.  However,  for  power-of-two  speed
increase  the  hardware  complexity  grows  logarithmically  with  speed-up  factor.  The  same  technique  can  be
applied to any higher-order system. For example, a second-order recursive Ô¨Ålter with transfer function
