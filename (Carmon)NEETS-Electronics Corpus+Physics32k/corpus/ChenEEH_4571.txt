of the proper control actions, however, are still
left un-
answered. For unanticipated failures under general format,
the online identiﬁcation and accommodation are even more
difﬁcult and rarely touched. When a dynamic system encoun-
ters failures possibly caused by unexpected interferences, it is
not a reasonable approach to assume certain types of dynamic
change caused by those unexpected failures. Of course, the
faulty system is possibly uncontrollable if the failure is very
serious and fatal. It is absolutely crucial to take early actions to
properly control the system behavior in time to prevent the
failure from causing more serious loss if the system under
failures is controllable at that time.
