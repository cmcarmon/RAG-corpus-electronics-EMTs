Regional Planning Criteria
The North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) deÔ¨Ånes nine geographical regions in North America,
as shown in Fig. 61.59 [NERC, 1988]. Transmission planning studies are performed at two levels: (1) individual
electric  utility  companies  separately  perform  planning  studies  of  their  internal  systems  and  (2) companies
jointly  participate  in  NERC  committees  or  working  groups  to  perform  regional  and  interregional  planning
studies. The purpose of regional planning studies is to evaluate the transfer capabilities between interconnected
utilities and the impact of severe disturbances.
