The blotting paper (paste-coated pulpboard separator) serves two purposesâ€”(1) it keeps the paste 
from making actual contact with the zinc container and (2) it permits the electrolyte from the paste to 
filter through to the zinc slowly. The cell is sealed at the top to keep air from entering and drying the 
electrolyte. Care should be taken to prevent breaking this seal.
