Example 1.6. For the circuit in Figure 1.18(A), deter-
mine the voltage across the 3-V resistor. The circuit has
two independent sources, one voltage source and one
current source. Figure 1.18(B) shows the circuit when
voltage source is activated and current source is deacti-
vated (replaced by an open circuit). Let V31 be the
voltage across the 3-V resistor in this circuit. Figure
1.18(C) shows the circuit when current source is acti-
vated and voltage source is deactivated (replaced by a
short circuit). Let V32 be the voltage across the 3-V
resistor in this circuit. Then you determine that the
voltage across the 3-V resistor in the given complete
circuit is V3 ¼ V31 þ V32.
