Computing the Direct Matrix
We observe that obtaining the coefﬁcients of the direct matrix in IE modeling is generally a two-step process.
The ﬁrst step is that of evaluating the deﬁning integral operator in which the unknown is replaced by the basis
functions selected. The second step involves integration of this result multiplied by the weight function selected.
When using delta-function weights, this second step is numerically trivial, but when using nondelta weights,
such as the case in a Galerkin approach, this second step can be analytically and numerically challenging.
