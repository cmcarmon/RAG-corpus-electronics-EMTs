To verify its zero state linearity set the voltage around the capacitor at time 0 equal to 0, or



v
(

t

0


)
=
0



{\displaystyle v(t_{0})=0\,}
, meaning that there is no initial voltage. This eliminates the first term forming the equation




v
(
t
)
=

∫

.



{\displaystyle v(t)=\int _{t_{0}}^{t}i(\tau )d\tau .\,}
.
In accordance with the methods of linear time-invariant systems, by putting two different inputs into the integrator circuit,




i

(
t
)



{\displaystyle i_{1}(t)\,}
and




i

(
t
)



{\displaystyle i_{2}(t)\,}
, the two different outputs

By using the superposition principle the inputs

{\displaystyle i_{1}(t)\,}
and

By integrating the right side of

is found, which implies the system is linear at zero state,

=

{\displaystyle v(t_{0})=0\,}
.
This entire verification example could also have been done with a voltage source in place of the current source and an inductor in place of the capacitor. We would have then been solving for a current instead of a voltage.
