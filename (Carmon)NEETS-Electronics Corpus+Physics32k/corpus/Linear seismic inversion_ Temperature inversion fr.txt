We start with an example to invert for earth parameter values from temperature depth distribution in a given earth region. Although this example does not directly relate to seismic inversion since no traveling acoustic waves are involved, it nonetheless introduces practical application of the inversion technique in a manner easy to comprehend, before moving on to seismic applications. In this example, the temperature of the earth is measured at discrete locations in a well bore by placing temperature sensors in the target depths. By assuming a forward model of linear distribution of temperature with depth, two parameters are inverted for from the temperature depth measurements.
The forward model is given by







F

(



q

=



T

z


{\displaystyle {\vec {F}}({\vec {q}})={\vec {T}}=a+bz}

where






q
→



=
[
a
,
b
]


{\displaystyle {\vec {q}}=[a,b]}
. Thus, the dimension of






q
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {q}}}
is 2 i.e. the number of parameters inverted for is 2.
The objective of this inversion algorithm is to find






p
→





{\displaystyle {\vec {p}}}
, which is the value of



[
a
,
b
]


{\displaystyle [a,b]}
that minimizes the difference between the observed temperature distribution and those obtained using the forward model of Eqn. 15. Considering the dimension of the forward model or the number of temperature observations to be

We present results from Marescot (2010) for the case of

{\displaystyle n=2}
for which the observed temperature values at depths were
