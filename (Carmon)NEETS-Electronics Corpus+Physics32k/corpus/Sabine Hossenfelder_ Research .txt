Hossenfelder remained in Germany until 2004 as a postdoctoral researcher at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany. She moved to North America and completed research fellowships at the University of Arizona, Tuscon, University of California, Santa Barbara and Perimeter Institute, Canada. She joined Nordita Institute for Theoretical Physics, Sweden in 2009 as an Assistant Professor. Today she is a Research Fellow at the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies.
Hossenfelder's research interest is in the phenomenology of quantum gravity. She focuses on the role of Lorentz invariance and locality, which would be altered in the discovery of quantum gravity. Hossenfelder is trying to find experimental evidence of quantum gravity. Since 2007 she has been involved with the annual conference series "Experimental Search for Quantum Gravity". Hossenfelder has created a number of YouTube videos exploring the topic.
