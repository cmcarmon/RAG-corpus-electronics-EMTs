A lag network used for series compensation will result in a reduction in the ﬁxed plant gain *GMu(w)* at all
high frequencies. This can only be achieved if the minor-loop transfer gain Gm(s) is constant for high frequencies.
In some cases this may be achievable but often will not be. It is possible to realize the equivalent of lag network
series  equalization  by  means  of  a  minor-loop  equalization  for  systems  where  the  low-  and  high-frequency
behavior of GMu(s), or Gf(s), and GMc(s) are the same and where the gain magnitude of the compensated system
*GMc(s)* is at no frequency any greater than is the gain magnitude of the fixed plant *Gf(s)* or the minor-loop–open
major-loop transfer function *GMu(s)*. Thus we see that lag-lead network series equalization is an ideal type of
equalization  to  realize  by  means  of  equivalent  minor-loop  equalization.  Figures  100.9  and  100.19  represent
ﬂowcharts of a suggested general design procedure for minor-loop compensator design as well as for the series
equalization approaches we examined previously.
