The poles of both functions are the same, z12 has only a
constant in the numerator, and three powers of s are in the
denominator. If we insert inﬁnity for any s in the denominator,
the function will become zero, and we say that z12 has three
zeros at inﬁnity. As was shown in the previous section, we
cannot remove zeros as elements, but we can remove them as
poles of inverted functions. Subtracting the admittance sC
from Y1 ¼ 1=Z1 leads to:
