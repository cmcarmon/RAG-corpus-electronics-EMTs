Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) is a
software standard developed by a consortium called the Object
Management Group (OMG). OMG has approximately 800
member companies who develop and adopt products that
abide by the standards set forth by OMG. A basic feature of
CORBA is the Object Request Broker (ORB) that handles
remote procedure calls. When an object calls a method of
another object distributed elsewhere on the network, the
ORB intercepts the call and directs it. In this manner, the
calling object does not need to know the location of the remote
object. The middleware itself is available in different languages
that all abide by the CORBA standard; for example, the Java 2
Platform Standard Edition, v1.3, includes a CORBA ORB. The
use of CORBA in control engineering is rather new; see Wills et
al. (2000) for details on the development of a product that is
based on a CORBA substrate. Some high-level features of
CORBA, however, make it very attractive for future control
engineering products used to integrate systems. Its main bene-
ﬁts are that it has a well-accepted standard for the interface, it
allows for interoperability of software components written in
different languages (including Java and Cþþ) and/or running
on different platforms, it handles all network communication
protocols, and it provides for run-time reconﬁguration of
software components. Components can also be integrated
that are not object-oriented (such as legacy code) by wrapping
the code in a layer that provides an object-oriented interface.
Services are continually being added to the ORB structure that
extend the capabilities of CORBA. For example, while CORBA
is implemented as a client/server communication model, a
layer (called an event service) has been added that emulates
the publish/subscribe behavior.
