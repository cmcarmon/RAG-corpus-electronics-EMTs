DC Generator Characteristics
Figure 13.1.8 shows schematic diagrams of ﬁeld-circuit connections for dc machines with-
out including commutating pole or compensating windings. Shunt generators can be either
separately excited or self-excited, as shown in Figures 13.1.8 (a) and (b), respectively. Com-
pound machines can be connected either long shunt, as in Figure 13.1.8(d), or short shunt, in
which the shunt-ﬁeld circuit is connected directly across the armature, without including the
series ﬁeld.
