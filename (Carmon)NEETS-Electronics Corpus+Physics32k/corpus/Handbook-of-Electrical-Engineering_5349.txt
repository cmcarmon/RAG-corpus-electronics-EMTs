The status of the technologies — including an examination of the problems, opportunities, and issues with
the various technical approaches — is summarized in this chapter. Bulk crystalline (Si, GaAs) and thin-ﬁlm
Cu-ternaries and multinaries, CdTe, hydrogenated amorphous silicon and dye-sensitized, CuInSe2, CdTe tech-
nologies  are  reviewed. Applications  for  ﬂat-plate  and  concentrator  modes  of  operation  are  considered.  This
chapter can only present a brief overview, and the reader is directed to several other sources for more detailed
evaluations and technical discussions [Kazmerski, 1997]. It can also only provide a “snapshot” of technologies
that are changing with advancing R&D and manufacturing.
