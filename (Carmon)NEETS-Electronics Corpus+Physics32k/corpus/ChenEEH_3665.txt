Similarly to glides, liquids, and diphthongs, affricates are
formed by transitions from a stop to a fricative. The two
affricates found in American English are the unvoiced affricate
=C= (stop =t=, followed by unvoiced fricative =S=) as in change
and the voiced affricate =J = (stop =d=, followed by the voiced
fricative =Z=) as in jam.
