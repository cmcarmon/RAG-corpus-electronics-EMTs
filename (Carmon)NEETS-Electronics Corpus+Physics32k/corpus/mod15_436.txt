E-TRANSFORMERâ€”A special form of differential transformer using an E-shaped core. The
secondaries of the transformer are wound on the outer legs of the E, and the primary is on
the center leg. An output voltage is developed across the secondary coils when its armature
is displaced from its neutral position. This device is used as an error detector in servo
systems that have limited load movements.
