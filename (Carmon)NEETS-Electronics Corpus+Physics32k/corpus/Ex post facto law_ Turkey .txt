Ex post facto punishment is prohibited by Article 38 of the Constitution of Turkey. It states:
c1. No one shall be punished for any act which does not constitute a criminal offence under the law in force at the time committed; no one shall be given a heavier penalty for an offence other than the penalty applicable at the time when the offence was committed.
c2. The provisions of the above paragraph shall also apply to the statute of limitations on offences and penalties and on the results of conviction.
Thus, the article does not prohibit in mitius laws, i.e. cases wherein the retroactive application benefits the accused person.
