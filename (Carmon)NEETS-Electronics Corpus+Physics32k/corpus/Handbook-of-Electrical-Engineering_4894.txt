Metals can have geometrically complicated Fermi surfaces wherein the Fermi surface contacts the Brillouin
zone boundary as well as encloses the center of the zone. This leads to the possibility of open electron orbits
in place of the closed cyclotron orbits for certain orientations of B. In these circumstances R can have a variety
of dependencies on the magnitude of B and in single crystals will generally be dependent on the exact orientation
of  B relative  to  the  crystalline  axes  [Hurd,  1972,  p.  51;  Fawcett,  1964].  R  will  not,  however,  have  any  simple
relationship to the number of current carriers in the material.
