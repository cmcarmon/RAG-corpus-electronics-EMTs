If  you  find  the  exponent  notation  shown  in  Table 
1.2  a  little  confusing,  just  remember  that  V(cid:1)1 is 
simply 1/V, s(cid:1)1 is 1/s,  m(cid:1)2 is 1/m(cid:1)2, and so on. 
 
Example 1.1 
 
The unit of flux density (the Tesla) is defined as the 
magnetic flux per unit area. Express this in terms of 
the fundamental units. 
 
Solution 
 
The  SI  unit  of  flux  is  the  Weber  (Wb).  Area  is 
directly  proportional 
length  squared  and, 
expressed in terms of the fundamental SI units, this 
is  square  metres  (m2).  Dividing  the  flux  (Wb)  by 
the  area  (m2) gives  Wb/m2 or  Wb  m(cid:1)2. Hence,  in 
terms  of  the  fundamental  SI  units,  the  Tesla  is 
expressed in Wb m(cid:1)2.
