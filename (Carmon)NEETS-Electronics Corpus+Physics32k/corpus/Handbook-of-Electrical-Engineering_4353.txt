For parabolic (a = 2) index proﬁle Eq. (40.29) give Ng = 
, which is half the corresponding number of modes

for step index ﬁber, and Eq. (40.30) gives V £ 2.405

. Thus, compared with step index ﬁber, graded index
ﬁber will have larger core radios for single mode operation, and for the same core radius, will support a fewer
number of modes.
