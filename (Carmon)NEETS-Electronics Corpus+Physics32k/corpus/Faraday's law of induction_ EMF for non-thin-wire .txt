It is tempting to generalize Faraday's law to state that If ∂Σ is any arbitrary closed loop in space whatsoever, then the total time derivative of magnetic flux through Σ equals the EMF around ∂Σ. This statement, however, is not always true—and not just for the obvious reason that EMF is undefined in empty space when no conductor is present. As noted in the previous section, Faraday's law is not guaranteed to work unless the velocity of the abstract curve ∂Σ matches the actual velocity of the material conducting the electricity. The two examples illustrated below show that one often obtains incorrect results when the motion of ∂Σ is divorced from the motion of the material.

One can analyze examples like these by taking care that the path ∂Σ moves with the same velocity as the material. Alternatively, one can always correctly calculate the EMF by combining the Lorentz force law with the Maxwell–Faraday equation:

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {E}}=\int _{\partial \Sigma }(\mathbf {E} +\mathbf {v} _{m}\times \mathbf {B} )\cdot d\mathbf {l} =\int _{\Sigma }{\frac {\partial \mathbf {B} }{\partial t}}\cdot d\mathbf {\Sigma } +\oint _{\partial \Sigma }(\mathbf {v} _{m}\times \mathbf {B} )\cdot d\mathbf {l} }

where "it is very important to notice that (1) [vm] is the velocity of the conductor ... not the velocity of the path element dl and (2) in general, the partial derivative with respect to time cannot be moved outside the integral since the area is a function of time".
