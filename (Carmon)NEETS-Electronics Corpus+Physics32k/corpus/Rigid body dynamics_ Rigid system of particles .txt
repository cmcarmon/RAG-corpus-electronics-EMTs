If a system of N particles, Pi, i=1,...,N, are assembled into a rigid body, then Newton's second law can be applied to each of the particles in the body. If Fi is the external force applied to particle Pi with mass mi, then

{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} _{i}+\sum _{j=1}^{N}\mathbf {F} _{ij}=m_{i}\mathbf {a} _{i},\quad i=1,\ldots ,N,}

where Fij is the internal force of particle Pj acting on particle Pi that maintains the constant distance between these particles.

An important simplification to these force equations is obtained by introducing the resultant force and torque that acts on the rigid system. This resultant force and torque is obtained by choosing one of the particles in the system as a reference point, R, where each of the external forces are applied with the addition of an associated torque. The resultant force F and torque T are given by the formulas,

where Ri is the vector that defines the position of particle Pi.
Newton's second law for a particle combines with these formulas for the resultant force and torque to yield,

where the internal forces Fij cancel in pairs. The kinematics of a rigid body yields the formula for the acceleration of the particle Pi in terms of the position R and acceleration a of the reference particle as well as the angular velocity vector ω and angular acceleration vector α of the rigid system of particles as,
