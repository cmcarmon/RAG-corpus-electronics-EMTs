HORIZONTAL-DEFLECTION PLATES.â€”Now let's look at horizontal-deflection action.
Assume that the resistance of the potentiometer shown in figure 6-11 is spread evenly along its length.
When the arm of the potentiometer is at the middle position, the same potential exists on each plate. Since
there is zero potential difference between the plates, an electrostatic field is not moved downward at a
uniform rate; the right plate will become more positive than the left (you are looking down through the
top of the CRT). The electron beam will move to the right from screen point 0 through points 1, 2, 3, and
4 in equal time intervals.
