Stranded or solid?
Cut open the cord of any old household lamp (only after unplugging the lamp, 
of course), and you see two or three small bundles of very fine wires, each 
wrapped in insulation. This is called stranded wire. Another type of wire, 
known as solid wire, consists of a single (thicker) wire wrapped in insulation. 
You can see examples of stranded and solid wires in Figure 12-1.
