Atrial ﬁbrillation is an electrical dysrhythmia in which all the atrial muscle ﬁbers are contracting and relaxing
asynchronously and there is no atrial pumping. This dysrhythmia [Fig. 113.14(5)] causes the ventricles to be
excited  at  a  very  rapid  and  irregular  rate.  Cardiac  output  is  reduced,  and  the  pulse  is  rapid  and  irregular  in
force and rate.
