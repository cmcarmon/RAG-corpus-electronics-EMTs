Ensuring rock‐solid resonance with crystals
If you slice a quartz crystal in just the right way, mount two 
leads to it, and enclose it in a hermetically sealed pack-
age, you’ve created a single component that acts like an 
RLC combo in an RLC circuit, resonating at a particular 
frequency. Quartz crystals, or simply crystals, are used in 
circuits to generate an electrical signal at a very precise 
frequency. Figure 8-9 shows the circuit symbol for a crystal, 
which is labeled XTAL in schematics.
