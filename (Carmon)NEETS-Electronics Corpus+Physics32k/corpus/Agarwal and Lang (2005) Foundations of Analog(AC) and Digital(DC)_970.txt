the amplifierâ€™s small signal behavior to Chapter 8. Accordingly, for now, and
in the rest of this chapter, we will not assume that the input is a small signal.
Rather, we will assume that the input vIN that is fed into the amplifier comprises
both the signal component of interest to this user (which may be a large valued
signal), and a DC offset (or DC bias). For simplicity, all calculations will be
performed on this boosted signal.
