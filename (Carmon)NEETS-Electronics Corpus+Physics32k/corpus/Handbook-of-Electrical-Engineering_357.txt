Maximum Power Transfer
The  diagram  in  Fig.  3.24  illustrates  a  two-terminal  linear  circuit  at  whose  terminals  an  impedance  ZL  is
connected. The circuit is assumed to be operating in the ac steady state. The problem to be addressed is this:
given  the  two-terminal  circuit,  how  can  the  impedance  connected  to  it  be  adjusted  so  that  the  maximum
possible average power is transferred from the circuit to the impedance?
