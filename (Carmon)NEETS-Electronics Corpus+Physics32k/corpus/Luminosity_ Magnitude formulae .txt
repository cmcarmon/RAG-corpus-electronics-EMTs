The magnitude of a star, a unitless measure, is a logarithmic scale of observed visible brightness. The apparent magnitude is the observed visible brightness from Earth which depends on the distance of the object. The absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude at a distance of 10 parsecs, therefore the bolometric absolute magnitude is a logarithmic measure of the bolometric luminosity.
The difference in bolometric magnitude between two objects is related to their luminosity ratio according to:

{\displaystyle M_{\text{bol1}}-M_{\text{bol2}}=-2.5\log _{10}{\frac {L_{\text{1}}}{L_{\text{2}}}}}

where:





M

{\displaystyle M_{\text{bol1}}}
is the bolometric magnitude of the first object





M

{\displaystyle M_{\text{bol2}}}
is the bolometric magnitude of the second object.





L

{\displaystyle L_{\text{1}}}
is the first object's bolometric luminosity





L

{\displaystyle L_{\text{2}}}
is the second object's bolometric luminosity
This can be used to derive a luminosity in solar units:

{\displaystyle M_{\odot }}
is the bolometric magnitude of the Sun (approximately 4.7554).
Although the absolute bolometric magnitude of the sun is approximately 4.7554, the zero point of the absolute magnitude scale is actually defined as a fixed luminosity of 3.0128×1028 W. Therefore, the absolute magnitude can be calculated from a luminosity in watts:
