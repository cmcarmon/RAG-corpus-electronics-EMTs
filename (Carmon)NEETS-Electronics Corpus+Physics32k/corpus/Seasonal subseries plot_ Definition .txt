Seasonal sub-series plots are formed by
Vertical axis: response variable
Horizontal axis: seasons in chronological order. For example, with monthly data, all the January values are plotted (in chronological order), then all the February values, and so on.
The horizontal line displays the mean value for each month over the time series.
The analyst must specify the length of the seasonal pattern before generating this plot. In most cases, the analyst will know this from the context of the problem and data collection.
