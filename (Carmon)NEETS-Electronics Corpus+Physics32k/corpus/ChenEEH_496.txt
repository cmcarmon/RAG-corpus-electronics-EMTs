In 1821, the German physicist Tomas Seebeck Ô¨Årst noticed
unusual properties of semiconductor materials, such as lead
sulfur (PbS). In 1833, the English physicist Michael Faraday
reported that resistance of semiconductors decreased as tem-
perature increased (opposite to what happens in metals, in
which resistance increases with temperature).
