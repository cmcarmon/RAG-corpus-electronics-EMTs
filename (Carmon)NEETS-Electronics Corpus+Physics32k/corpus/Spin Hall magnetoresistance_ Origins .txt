Spin Hall magnetoresistance is one of many ways in which the electrical resistance of a material is influenced by the spin Hall effect. An electron moving through a conductor is scattered by the spin Hall effect in a direction determined by its spin orientation which induces a net accumulation of spin at the conductors edge. The spin polarized electrons at the conductors surface are able to interact with the magnetization of a magnetic material in close proximity through a spin-transfer torque. When the conduction electrons spin is aligned parallel to the magnetization direction the electron reflects from the conductor surface with no change in its spin, however, when there is a component of the magnetization that is normal to the spin orientation, the spin can be flipped to its opposite state transferring angular momentum into the magnetic material. This results in a spin current that travels at a normal to the direction of the charge current that can be altered by changing the direction of magnetization. This spin current is deflected through the inverse spin Hall effect which adds or subtracts from the electrons momentum in the direction of the charge current depending on the size and sign of the conductors spin Hall angle. This deflection provides an addition to the conductors resistivity allowing the spin current to be estimated by the change in the electrical resistivity
