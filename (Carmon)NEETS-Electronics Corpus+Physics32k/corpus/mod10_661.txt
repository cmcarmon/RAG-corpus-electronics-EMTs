As you have studied in the previous sections, a 1/2 wavelength antenna is the shortest antenna that 
can be used in free space. If we cut a half-wave antenna in half and then ground one end, we will have a 
grounded quarter-wave antenna. This antenna will resonate at the same frequency as the ungrounded half-
wave antenna. Such an antenna is referred to as a QUARTER-WAVE or Marconi antenna. Quarter-wave 
antennas are widely used in the military. Most mobile transmitting and receiving antennas (fig. 4-17) are 
quarter-wave antennas.
