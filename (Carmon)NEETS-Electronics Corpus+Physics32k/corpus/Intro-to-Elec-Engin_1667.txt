Since dc motors of various types are used extensively in control systems, it is essential for
analytical purposes that we establish a mathematical model for the dc motor. Let us consider the
case of a separately excited dc motor with constant ﬁeld excitation. The schematic representation
of the model of a dc motor is shown in Figure E16.2.1(a). We will investigate how the speed
of the motor responds to changes in the voltage applied to the armature terminals. The linear
analysis involves electrical transients in the armature circuit and the dynamics of the mechanical
load driven by the motor. At a constant motor ﬁeld current If, the electromagnetic torque and the
generated emf are given by
