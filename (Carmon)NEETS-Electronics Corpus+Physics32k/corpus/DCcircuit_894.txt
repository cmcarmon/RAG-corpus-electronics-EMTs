The logarithmic pH scale works like this: a solution with 10−12 moles of H+ ions per liter
has a pH of 12; a solution with 10−3 moles of H+ ions per liter has a pH of 3. While very
uncommon, there is such a thing as an acid with a pH measurement below 0 and a caustic
with a pH above 14. Such solutions, understandably, are quite concentrated and extremely
reactive.
