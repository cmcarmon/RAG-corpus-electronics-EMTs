Universal Multimedia Access (UMA) is one of the important
emerging applications for multimedia systems and signal pro-
cessing. The basic idea of UMA is to adapt media-rich content
according to usage environment. The emerging MPEG-7 and
MPEG-21 standards address different aspects of UMA by
standardizing metadata descriptions for adapting this content.
In this chapter, we described how UMA is supported in multi-
media systems through media resource transcoding and multi-
media content selection.
