Only waves with raypaths for which the total phase change for a complete (up and down) zigzag path is an
integral multiple of 2p undergo constructive interference, resulting in guided modes. Waves with raypaths not
satisfying this mode condition interfere destructively and die out rapidly. In terms of a raypath with an angle
of incidence qi = q in Fig. 42.3, the mode conditions [Haus, 1984] for Ô¨Åelds transverse to the z axis and with
even and odd symmetry about the x axis are given, respectively, by
