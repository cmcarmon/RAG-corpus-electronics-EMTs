Suppose it is desired to estimate the failure rate of a certain component. A test can be performed to estimate its failure rate. Ten identical components are each tested until they either fail or reach 1000 hours, at which time the test is terminated for that component. (The level of statistical confidence is not considered in this example.) The results are as follows:
Estimated failure rate is







6

failures



7502

hours




=
0.0007998

{\displaystyle {\frac {6{\text{ failures}}}{7502{\text{ hours}}}}=0.0007998\,{\frac {\text{failures}}{\text{hour}}}=799.8\times 10^{-6}\,{\frac {\text{failures}}{\text{hour}}},}

or 799.8 failures for every million hours of operation.
