Additional cost for the cable itself.
Insulation degrades due to sun exposure, though the critical insulation between the wires is somewhat shielded from the sun.
Shorter spans and more poles due to increased weight.
Can lead to much longer repair times for installations in hilly areas due to much higher line weights requiring bigger and more specialized equipment to repair.
Older installations are known to cause fires in areas where falling large trees or branches regularly cause breaks in lines and or in insulation leading to short circuits which can then lead to burning insulation dripping to ground and starting ground fires.
Failure modes through punctures, electrical tracking, and erosion.
