Suppose you apply an AC voltage source across a capacitor. Remember that 
an AC voltage source varies up and down, rising from 0 volts to its peak volt-
age, then falling back through 0 volts and down to its negative peak voltage, 
then rising back through 0 volts to its peak voltage, and so on. Imagine being 
an atom on one of the capacitor plates and looking at the AC source terminal 
nearest you. Sometimes you feel a force pulling your electrons in one direc-
tion, and other times you feel a force pulling your electrons in the other 
direction. In each case, the strength of the force will vary over time as the
