In the ﬂuted designs, ﬁbers are laid in the grooves of plastic central members and are relatively free to move.
The shape and size of the grooves vary with the design. The grooved core may also contain a central strength
member. A sheath is formed over the grooved core, and this essentially forms a unit. Several units may then
be stranded around a central strength member to form a cable core of desired size, over which different types
of sheaths are formed. Fluted designs have been pioneered in France and Canada.
