phase angle, a device that is proportional to both the power factor and the apparent power must be used. 
Because power-level measurements are concerned with decibel units, a working knowledge of decibels is 
required for proper interpretation of power tests. The decibel is used to determine the ratio of power 
changes or to indicate the power level in a circuit with respect to either 0 or a standard reference level.
