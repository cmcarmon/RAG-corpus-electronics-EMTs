The torque acting on a point-like particle is defined as the derivative of the angular momentum tensor given above with respect to proper time:





Γ

=



d

M



d
τ



=

X

∧

F



{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\Gamma }}={\frac {d\mathbf {M} }{d\tau }}=\mathbf {X} \wedge \mathbf {F} }

or in tensor components:





Γ

α
β


=

X

α



F

β


−

X

β



F

α




{\displaystyle \Gamma _{\alpha \beta }=X_{\alpha }F_{\beta }-X_{\beta }F_{\alpha }}

where F is the 4d force acting on the particle at the event X. As with angular momentum, torque is additive, so for an extended object one sums or integrates over the distribution of mass.
