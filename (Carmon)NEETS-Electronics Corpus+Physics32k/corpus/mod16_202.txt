Power measurements for af circuits are usually indicated in terms of decibels (dB) or decibels
referenced to 1 milliwatt (dBm). Because the actual calculation of decibel measurements is seldom
required, the following explanation is somewhat simplified. Most test equipment is designed to measure
and indicate decibels directly. This eliminates the need for you to perform complicated calculations.
Nevertheless, a basic explanation of the decibel measurement system is necessary for you to understand
the significance of dB readings and amplifier-gain ratings that are expressed in decibels.
