The demagnetizing effect of the armature mmf under pole faces can be compensated for, or
neutralized, by providing a compensating (pole-face) winding, arranged in slots in the pole face
in series with the armature, having a polarity opposite to that of the adjoining armature winding
and having the same axis as that of the armature. Because they are costly, pole-face windings
