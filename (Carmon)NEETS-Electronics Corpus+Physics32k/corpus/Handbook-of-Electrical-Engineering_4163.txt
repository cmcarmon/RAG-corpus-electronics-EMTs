For positive return strokes, there are more very large peak currents at the channel base, in the 100-kA range,
than for return strokes lowering negative charge to ground, although the median value for both positives and
negatives  is  not  much  different  [Berger  et al.,  1975].  This  observation  is  supported  by  measurements  of  the
initial  peak  magnetic  ﬁeld  from  positive  and  negative  return  strokes  made  with  magnetic  direction-ﬁnding
networks worldwide, where various investigations have found the mean peak positive ﬁeld to be about twice
the mean peak negative.
