Very recently, low-speed polymer-on-Si switches have been commercially introduced. These also operate via
the  thermooptic  effect.  However,  since  polymers  can  be  engineered  with  electrooptic  properties,  high-speed
devices may also be available in the future. The primary impediment to market penetration of polymer-based
devices has been their relatively poor stability, especially at temperatures above 100(cid:176)C. However, if polymers
can be produced with both strong electrooptic properties and enhanced stability with temperature, they could
be the material system of choice for many applications because of their low-cost potential.
