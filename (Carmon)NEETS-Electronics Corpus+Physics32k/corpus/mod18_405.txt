The LOGARITHMIC RECEIVER uses a linear logarithmic amplifier, commonly called a LIN-LOG
AMPLIFIER, instead of a normal IF amplifier. The lin-log amplifier is a nonsaturating amplifier that does
not ordinarily use any special gain-control circuits. The output voltage of the lin-log amplifier is a linear
function of the input voltage for low-amplitude signals. It is a logarithmic function for high-amplitude
signals. In other words, the range of linear amplification does not end at a definite saturation point, as is
the case in normal IF amplifiers. The comparison of the response curves for normal IF and lin-log
amplifiers is shown in figure 2-32. The curves show that a continued increase in the input to the lin-log
amplifier causes a continued increase in the output, but at a reduced rate. Therefore, a large signal does
not saturate the lin-log amplifier; rather, it merely reduces the amplification of a simultaneously applied
small signal. A small echo signal can often be detected by the lin-log receiver when a normal receiver
would be saturated.
