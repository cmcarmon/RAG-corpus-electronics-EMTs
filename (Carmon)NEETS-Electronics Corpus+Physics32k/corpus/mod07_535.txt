Voltage multipliers may also be used as primary power supplies where a 177 volt-ac input is 
rectified to pulsating dc. This dc output voltage may be increased (through use of a voltage multiplier) to 
as much as 1000 volts dc. This voltage is generally used as the plate or screen grid voltage for electron 
tubes.
