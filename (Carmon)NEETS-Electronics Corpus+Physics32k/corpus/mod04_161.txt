A transformer in the soldering gun supplies approximately 1 volt at high current to a loop of copper, 
which acts as the soldering tip. It heats to soldering temperature in 3 to 5 seconds. However, it may 
overheat to the point of incandescence if left on over 30 seconds. This should be avoided because excess 
heat will burn the insulation off the wiring. The gun is operated by a finger switch. The gun heats only 
while the switch is pressed.
