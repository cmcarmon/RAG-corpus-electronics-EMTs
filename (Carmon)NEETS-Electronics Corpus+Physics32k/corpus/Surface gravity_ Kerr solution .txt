The surface gravity for the uncharged, rotating black hole is, simply




κ
=
g
−
k
,


{\displaystyle \kappa =g-k,}

where



g
=


1

4
M





{\displaystyle g={\frac {1}{4M}}}
is the Schwarzschild surface gravity, and



k
:=
M

Ω

2




{\displaystyle k:=M\Omega _{+}^{2}}
is the spring constant of the rotating black hole.




Ω

+




{\displaystyle \Omega _{+}}
is the angular velocity at the event horizon. This expression gives a simple Hawking temperature of

π
T
=
g

{\displaystyle 2\pi T=g-k}
.
