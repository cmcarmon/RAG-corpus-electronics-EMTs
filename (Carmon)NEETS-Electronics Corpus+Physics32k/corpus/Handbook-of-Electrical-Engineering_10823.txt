Environmental issues that also require attention include the constituent materials for encapsulants, the metals
used for connection and attachment, the energy consumed in high-temperature processes, and the chemicals
and  solvents  used  in  the  packaging  process.  Here,  emerging  packaging  technologies  will  have  the  effect  of
reducing  the  quantity  of  materials  used  in  the  packaging  process  by  shrinking  IC  package  sizes.  Increasing
predominance of plastic packaging will reduce energy consumption associated with hermetic ceramic packaging.
