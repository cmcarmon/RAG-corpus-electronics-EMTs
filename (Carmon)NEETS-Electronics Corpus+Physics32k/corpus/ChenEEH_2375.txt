For this type of waveguide, it is important to evaluate the
capacitance and the inductance per unit length, respectively.
These two parameters enable the computation of the charac-
teristic impedance of the line. To characterize the propagation,
the propagation constant can be identiﬁed for the line, whereas
the loss is divided in dielectric loss (ad) and conductor loss
(ac). Table 5.4 illustrates the fundamental parameters of four
different types of transmission line that are used in practice.
The ﬁrst type of line is the coaxial transmission line. This line
is made out of a central conductor surrounded by a grounded
one. The separation between the two conductors can be simple
air or dielectric. Air-ﬁlled coaxial
lines are very attractive
because of very low dielectric loss. They are, however, difﬁcult
to manufacture since the central conductor must be suspended
in air.
