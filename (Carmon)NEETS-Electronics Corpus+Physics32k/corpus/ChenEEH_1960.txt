. One example considered a limited number of faults; this
case occurs mostly in fabrication defects and short-life
missions. The track overheads for all cases are very small:
1.75% for one fault to 4.49% for four faults. Except for
one circuit, all other circuits require an absolute of one
extra track to tolerate four faults; a few do not require any
extra tracks.
