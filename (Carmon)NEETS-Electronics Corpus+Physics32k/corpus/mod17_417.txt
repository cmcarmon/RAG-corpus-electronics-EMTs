In figure 3-30, the output of channel one is the voice frequency range of 100 to 3,500 hertz. The 
output of channel two is the combination of a different voice frequency with a subcarrier frequency of 
4,000 hertz. The output of channel three is another voice frequency. This voice frequency combined with 
a subcarrier frequency of 8,000 hertz gives you an output frequency range of 8,100 to 11,500 hertz. The 
overall bw for the composite modulation package shown is 100 to 15,500 hertz. Each separate channel 
occupies its own band of frequencies. The composite signal is used to modulate the carrier frequency of 
the transmitter.
