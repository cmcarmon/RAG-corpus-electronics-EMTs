Lets consider the example of the Wheatstone bridge circuit shown in ﬁgure 1.6. We
wish to calculate the currents around the loops. The three currents are identiﬁed as: Ia the
clockwise current around the large interior loop which includes the EMF, Ib the clockwise
current around the top equilateral triangle, and Ic the clockwise current around the bottom
equilateral triangle. The voltage loop expressions for the three current loops are
