Graham's law states that the rate at which gas molecules diffuse is inversely proportional to the square root of its density at constant temperature.Combined with Avogadro's law (i.e. since equal volumes have equal number of molecules) this is the same as being inversely proportional to the root of the molecular weight.
Dalton's law of partial pressures states that the pressure of a mixture of gases simply is the sum of the partial pressures of the individual components. Dalton's law is as follows:

where PTotal is the total pressure of the atmosphere,
PGas is the pressure of the gas mixture in the atmosphere,
and PH2O is the water pressure at that temperature.
Amagat's law of partial volume states that the volume of a mixture of gases (or the volume of the container) simply is the sum of the partial volumes of the individual components. Amagat's law is as follows:

Vi is the partial volume of the gas in the gas mixture at that pressure and that temperature.
Henry's law states that:
At constant temperature, the amount of a given gas dissolved in a given type and volume of liquid is directly proportional to the partial pressure of that gas in equilibrium with that liquid.
