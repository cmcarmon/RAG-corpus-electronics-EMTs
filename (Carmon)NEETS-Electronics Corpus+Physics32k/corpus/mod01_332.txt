The current flow through the load is the movement of electrons from the negative electrode of the 
cell (zinc) and to the positive electrode (carbon). This causes fewer electrons in the zinc and an excess of 
electrons in the carbon. Figure 2-1 shows the hydrogen ions (H2) from the sulfuric acid being attracted to 
the carbon electrode. Since the hydrogen ions are positively charged, they are attracted to the negative 
charge on the carbon electrode. This negative charge is caused by the excess of electrons. The zinc 
electrode has a positive charge because it has lost electrons to the carbon electrode. This positive charge 
attracts the negative ions (S04) from the sulfuric acid. The negative ions combine with the zinc to form 
zinc sulfate. This action causes the zinc electrode to be eaten away. Zinc sulfate is a grayish-white 
substance that is sometimes seen on the battery post of an automobile battery.
