c) Suppose we wish to amplify an AC input signal vi. Assume that vi has a zero DC
offset. Draw a circuit showing how a separate DC input voltage VI can be used to
bias the amplifier in a region where saturation region operation is achieved for both
positive and negative excursions of vi. Assuming the vi has symmetric positive and
negative swings, how would you choose the input operating point for the amplifier
that allows a maximum peak-to-peak voltage range for vi? What is the corresponding
output operating point (vO and iDS)?
