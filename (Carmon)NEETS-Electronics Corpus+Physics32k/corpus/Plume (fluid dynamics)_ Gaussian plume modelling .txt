Gaussian plume models can be used in several fluid dynamics scenarios to calculate concentration distribution of solutes such as a smoke stack release or contaminant released in a river. Gaussian distributions are established by Fickian diffusion, and follow a gaussian (bell-shaped) distribution. For calculating the expected concentration of a one dimensional instantaneous point source we consider a mass M released at an instantaneous point in time, in a one dimensional domain along x. This will give the following equation:

{\displaystyle C(x,t)=M/\surd (4\pi *D*t)*exp((x-x0)^{2}/(4D(t-t0))}

where M is the mass released at time t=t0 and location x=x0, and D is the diffusivity [m^2/s]. This equation makes the following four assumptions:
The mass M is released instantaneously.
The mass M is released in an infinite domain.
The mass spreads only through diffusion.
Diffusion does not vary in space.
