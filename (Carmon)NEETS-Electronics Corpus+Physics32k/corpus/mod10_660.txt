Energy may also be fed to the half-wave antenna by dividing the antenna at its center and connecting 
the transmission line from the final transmitter output stage to the two center ends of the halved antenna. 
Since the antenna is now being fed at the center (a point of low voltage and high current), this type of feed 
is known as the CENTER-FEED or CURRENT-FEED method. The point of feed is important in 
determining the type of transmission line to be used.
