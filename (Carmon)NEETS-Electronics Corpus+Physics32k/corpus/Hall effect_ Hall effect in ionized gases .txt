The Hall effect in an ionized gas (plasma) is significantly different from the Hall effect in solids (where the Hall parameter is always much less than unity). In a plasma, the Hall parameter can take any value. The Hall parameter, β, in a plasma is the ratio between the electron gyrofrequency, Ωe, and the electron-heavy particle collision frequency, ν:

{\displaystyle \beta ={\frac {\Omega _{\mathrm {e} }}{\nu }}={\frac {eB}{m_{\mathrm {e} }\nu }}}

where
e is the elementary charge (approximately 1.6×10−19 C)
B is the magnetic field (in teslas)
me is the electron mass (approximately 9.1×10−31 kg).
The Hall parameter value increases with the magnetic field strength.
Physically, the trajectories of electrons are curved by the Lorentz force. Nevertheless, when the Hall parameter is low, their motion between two encounters with heavy particles (neutral or ion) is almost linear. But if the Hall parameter is high, the electron movements are highly curved. The current density vector, J, is no longer collinear with the electric field vector, E. The two vectors J and E make the Hall angle, θ, which also gives the Hall parameter:
