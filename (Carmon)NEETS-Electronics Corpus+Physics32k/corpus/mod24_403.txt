Fiber optic connectors can also reduce system performance by introducing modal and reflection
noise. The cause of modal noise in fiber optic connectors is the interfering of the different wavefronts of
different modes within the fiber at the connector interface. Modal noise is eliminated by using only single
mode fiber with laser sources and only low-coherence sources such as light-emitting diodes with
multimode fiber. Fiber optic connectors can introduce reflection noise by reflecting light back into the
optical source. Reflection noise is reduced by index matching gels, physical contact polishes, or
antireflection coatings. Generally, reflection noise is only a problem in high data rate single mode systems
using lasers.
