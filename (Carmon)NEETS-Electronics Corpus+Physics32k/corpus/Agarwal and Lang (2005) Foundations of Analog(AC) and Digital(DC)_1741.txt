Through a comparison with the results of Section 12.1, we also see that
for large Q, that is, for a relatively short-circuited R and hence light damping,
the introduction of a resistor into the circuit causes an exponential decay of the
states and the stored energy. A sketch of the energy versus time is shown in
Figure 12.23 for the case
