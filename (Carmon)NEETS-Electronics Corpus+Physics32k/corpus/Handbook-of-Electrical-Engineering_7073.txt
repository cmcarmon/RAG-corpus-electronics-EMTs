Quantization and Vector Quantization
The rate distortion function represents the lower bound on the rate that is needed to represent a source with
a particular distortion. We now consider simple algorithms that represent a continuous random variable with
a few bits. Suppose we want to represent a single sample from a continuous source. Let the random variable
to be represented be X and let the representation of X be denoted as ˆX (X). If we are given R bits to represent
X, then the function ˆX can take on 2R values. The problem of optimum quantization is to ﬁnd the optimum
set of values for ˆX (called the reproduction points or code points) and the regions that are associated with each
value ˆX in order to minimize the expected distortion.
