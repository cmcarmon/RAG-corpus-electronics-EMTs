It is likely that the mechanism involved when direct currents are directly applied to injured bone (or other
tissue) differs from the transduction sequence which must be acting when low-intensity alternating ﬁelds are
employed. Even the 5-mA continuous current of the implantable devices (F, G in Table 113.2) when distributed
over  an  (estimated)  5-cm2 area  corresponds  to  a  steady  electric  ﬁeld  of  1  V/m  in  bone  tissue  of  0.01-S/m
conductivity. This value is large compared with the average (but not the peak) ﬁelds induced by some PEMF
devices and very large compared with the average ﬁelds induced in tissue by other PEMF devices [Rubin et al.,
1989]  or  the  mV/m  ELF  sinusoidal  ﬁelds  that  affect  cartilage  and  bone  development  [Ciomber  et al.,  1991;
McLeod and Rubin, 1990]. For example, if one assumes a mean radius of 4 cm for a particular human bone
fracture, one obtains from Eq. (113.17) the electric ﬁeld values between 0.18 and 1.74 V/m shown on Table 113.3.
When electrodes are implanted, as for the dc signals, chemical reactions at the electrodes may play a role in
bone and cartilage formation. For example, the reaction at a stainless steel cathode involves consumption of
dissolved oxygen and increase in local pH [Lavine and Grodzinsky, 1987].
