Because the unfolding algorithm is based on graph theoretic approach, it can also be applied at the bit level.

simple example of this unfolding is illustrated in Fig. 18.4, where the bit-serial adder in Fig. 18.4(a) is unfolded
by a factor of 2 to obtain the digit-serial adder in Fig. 18.4(b) for digit size 2 for a word length of 4. In obvious
ways, the unfolding transformation can be applied to both word level and bit level simultaneously to generate
word-parallel digit-serial architectures. Such architectures process multiple words per clock cycle and process
a digit of each word (not the entire word).
