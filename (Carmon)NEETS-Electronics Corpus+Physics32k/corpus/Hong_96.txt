Operational  amplifiers  (op  amps)  are  pre-packaged  transistor  amplifier  building 
blocks designed for analog signal processing. Its name is a legacy of its original purpose 
to  perform  arithmetic  operations  in  analog  computing.  First  sold  as  a  monolithic 
component in the 1960â€™s, op amps have proven to be the most versatile building block in 
analog  circuit  design.  Today,  the  availability  of  low-cost  and  high  performance  of  op 
amps makes them ubiquitous in almost all analog circuits.
