Now that you have solved for the unknown quantities in this circuit, you can apply what you have
learned to any series, parallel, or combination circuit. It is important to remember to first look at the
circuit and from observation make your determination of the type of circuit, what is known, and what you
are looking for. A minute spent in this manner may save you many unnecessary calculations.
