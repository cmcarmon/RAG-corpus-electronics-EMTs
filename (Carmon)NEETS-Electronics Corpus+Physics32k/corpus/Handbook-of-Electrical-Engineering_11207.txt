In some facilities, special electrically shielded rooms minimize environmental electrical noise, particularly
60-Hz  alternating  current  (ac)  line  noise.  Since  much  of  the  information  of  interest  in  the  EEG  lies  in  the
frequency bands less than 40 Hz, low-pass ﬁlters in the ampliﬁer can be switched into attenuate 60-Hz noise
sharply.
