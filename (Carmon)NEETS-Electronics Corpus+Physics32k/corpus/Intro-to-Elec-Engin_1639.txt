Transfer Functions and Block Diagrams
The transfer function is a means by which the dynamic characteristics of devices or systems are
described. The transfer function is a mathematical formulation that relates the output variable of
a device to the input variable. For linear devices, the transfer function is independent of the input
quantity and solely dependent on the parameters of the device together with any operations of time,
such as differentiation and integration, that it may possess. To obtain the transfer function, one
usually goes through three steps: (i) determining the governing equation for the device, expressed
in terms of the output and input variables, (ii) Laplace transforming the governing equation,
assuming all initial conditions to be zero, and (iii) rearranging the equation to yield the ratio of
the output to input variable. The properties of transfer functions are summarized as follows.
