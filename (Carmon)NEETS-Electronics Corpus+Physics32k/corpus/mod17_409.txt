Figure 3-29, view A, illustrates, the fundamental principle of tdm. Let's look at an example. Assume 
that a 3,000-hertz tone is applied to each of the six channels in the transmitter. Assume also that the 
rotating switch turns fast enough to sample, in turn, each of the six channels 2.4 times during each cycle 
of the 3,000-hertz tone. The speed of rotation of the switch must then be 2.4 Ã— 3,000 or 7,200 rotations 
per second. This is the optimum sampling for a practical system.
