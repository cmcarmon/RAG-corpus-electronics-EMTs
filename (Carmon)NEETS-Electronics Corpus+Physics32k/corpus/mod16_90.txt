Each activity submits an initial inventory, using the form shown in figure 1-2, to its Metrology
Calibration Representative (METCALREP) for approval. The METCALREP then forwards the inventory
to the Measure Operational Control Center (MOCC). The MOCC, based on the information contained on
these inventory report forms, provides the necessary preprinted Metrology Equipment Recall and
Reporting (METER) card. Figure 1-3 illustrates a MEASURE METER card.
