Experts say déjà vu (i.e. already seen) might be explained by the Multiverse. This is because the corresponding event has already happened on a parallel earth and because of that we have already experienced the current situation. Alternative explanations associate deja vu with past life memories, but if the glimpse of the current situation in a past life having surroundings of the current time and things is impossible, then it can be the vision of the same thing in another Earth (parallel Earth) in a different time.
