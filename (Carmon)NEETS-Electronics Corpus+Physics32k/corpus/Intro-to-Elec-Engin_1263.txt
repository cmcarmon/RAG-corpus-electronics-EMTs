*13.4.3 A 10-hp, 250-V shunt motor has an armature-
circuit resistance of 0.5  and a ﬁeld resistance
of 200 . At no load, rated voltage, and 1200
r/min, the armature current is 3 A. At full load
and rated voltage, the line current is 40 A, and the
ﬂux is 5% less than its no-load value because of
armature reaction. Compute the full-load speed.
