Refer to Fig. 2.55 and assume there are 10 light bulbs that can be con-
nected  in  parallel  and  10  light  bulbs  that  can  be  connected  in  series,
each with a power rating of 40 W. If the voltage at the plug is 110 V
for  the  parallel  and  series  connections,  calculate  the  current  through
each bulb for both cases.
