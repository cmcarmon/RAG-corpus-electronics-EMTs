Because cp is usually just the input capacitance of a logic gate,
it is very small. Any value of Cc can cause signiﬁcant charge-
sharing to occur. Active nodes are much less susceptible to
disruption by noise coupling since the equivalent output re-
sistance, ra, of the driving gate may be large (> 10 kV). The
noise coupled to the victim node is written as:
