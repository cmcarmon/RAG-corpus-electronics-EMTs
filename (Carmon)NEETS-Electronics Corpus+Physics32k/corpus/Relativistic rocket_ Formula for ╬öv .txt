In order to make the calculations simpler, we assume that the acceleration is constant (in the rocket's reference frame) during the acceleration phase; however, the result is nonetheless valid if the acceleration varies, as long as




I

s
p




{\displaystyle I_{sp}}
is constant.
In the nonrelativistic case, one knows from the (classical) Tsiolkovsky rocket equation that

{\displaystyle \Delta v=I_{sp}\ln {\frac {m_{0}}{m_{1}}}.}

Assuming constant acceleration

{\displaystyle t={\frac {I_{sp}}{a}}\ln {\frac {m_{0}}{m_{1}}}.}

In the relativistic case, the equation still valid if



a


{\displaystyle a}
is the acceleration in the rocket's reference frame and



t


{\displaystyle t}
is the rocket's proper time because at velocity 0 the relationship between force and acceleration is the same as in the classical case. Solving this equation for the ratio of initial mass to final mass gives

{\displaystyle {\frac {m_{0}}{m_{1}}}=\exp \left[{\frac {at}{I_{sp}}}\right].}

where "exp" is the exponential function. Another related equation gives the mass ratio in terms of the end velocity

{\displaystyle {\frac {\Delta v}{c}}=\tanh \left[{\frac {at}{c}}\right]}

By applying the Lorentz transformation, one can calculate the end velocity

{\displaystyle t'={\frac {c}{a}}\sinh \left({\frac {at}{c}}\right).}

Substituting the proper time from the Tsiolkovsky equation and substituting the resulting rest frame time in the expression for

{\displaystyle \Delta v}

{\displaystyle \Delta v=c\tanh \left({\frac {I_{sp}}{c}}\ln {\frac {m_{0}}{m_{1}}}\right).}

The formula for the corresponding rapidity (the inverse hyperbolic tangent of the velocity divided by the speed of light) is simpler:

Since rapidities, contrary to velocities, are additive, they are useful for computing the total
