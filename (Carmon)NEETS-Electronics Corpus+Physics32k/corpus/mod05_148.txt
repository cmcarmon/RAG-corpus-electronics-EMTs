In this simple motor, the momentum of the rotating armature carries the armature past the position 
where the unlike poles are exactly lined up. However, if these fields are exactly lined up when the 
armature current is turned on, there is no momentum to start the armature moving. In this case, the motor 
would not rotate. It would be necessary to give a motor like this a spin to start it. This disadvantage does 
not exist when there are more turns on the armature, because there is more than one armature field. No 
two armature fields could be exactly aligned with the field from the field poles at the same time.
