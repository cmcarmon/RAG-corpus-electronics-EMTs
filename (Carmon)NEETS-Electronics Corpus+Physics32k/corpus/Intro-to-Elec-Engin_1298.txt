where a0, a1, b1, . . . are the Fourier coefﬁcients, and ω is the fundamental angular frequency
related to the period T by ω = 2π/T = 2πf . The integer multiples of ω are known as harmonics:
2ω being the second harmonic that is even, 3ω being the third harmonic that is odd, and so forth.
The dc component is given by
