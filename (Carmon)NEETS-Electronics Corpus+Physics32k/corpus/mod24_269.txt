A matched-clad single mode step-index fiber has a core of radius (a) and a constant refractive index
n1. A cladding of slightly lower refractive index surrounds the core. The cladding has a refractive index
n2. Figure 3-6 shows the refractive index profile n(r) for the matched-clad single mode fiber.
