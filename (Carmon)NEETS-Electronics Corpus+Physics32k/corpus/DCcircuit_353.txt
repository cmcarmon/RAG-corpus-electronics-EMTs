As we saw earlier, a power system with no secure connection to earth ground is unpredictable
from a safety perspective: there’s no way to guarantee how much or how little voltage will exist
between any point in the circuit and earth ground. By grounding one side of the power system’s
voltage source, at least one point in the circuit can be assured to be electrically common with
the earth and therefore present no shock hazard. In a simple two-wire electrical power system,
the conductor connected to ground is called the neutral, and the other conductor is called the
hot, also known as the live or the active:
