Digital signal processing (DSP) is used in numerous applications. These applications include telephony, mobile
radio, satellite communications, speech processing, video and image processing, biomedical applications, radar,
and sonar. Real-time implementations of DSP systems require design of hardware that can match the application
sample rate to the hardware processing rate (which is related to the clock rate and the implementation style).
Thus, real-time does not always mean high speed. Real-time architectures are capable of processing samples as
they are received from the signal source, as opposed to storing them in buffers for later processing as done in
batch processing. Furthermore, real-time architectures operate on an inﬁnite time series (since the number of
the samples of the signal source is so large that it can be considered inﬁnite). While speech and sonar applications
require lower sample rates, radar and video image processing applications require much higher sample rates.
The sample rate information alone cannot be used to choose the architecture. The algorithm complexity is also
an important consideration. For example, a very complex and computationally intensive algorithm for a low-
sample-rate application and a computationally simple algorithm for a high-sample-rate application may require
similar  hardware  speed  and  complexity.  These  ranges  of  algorithms  and  applications  motivate  us  to  study  a
wide variety of architecture styles.
