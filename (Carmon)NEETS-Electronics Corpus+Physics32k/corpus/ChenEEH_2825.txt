Computational electromagnetics has played an important role
in helping to assess and mitigate the effects of high-level
electromagnetic wave coupling into sensitive electrical and
electronic equipment. The primary sources of such waves
include lightning, nuclear electromagnetic pulse (NEMP),
and high-power microwaves (HPM).
