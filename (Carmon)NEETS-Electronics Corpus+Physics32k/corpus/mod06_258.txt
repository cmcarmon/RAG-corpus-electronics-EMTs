Interelectrode capacitance cannot be eliminated from vacuum tubes, but it can be reduced. The
easiest method found to reduce interelectrode capacitance is to split the capacitance between the grid and
plate (Cpg) into two capacitors connected in series. This is done by placing an extra grid, called the
SCREEN GRID, between the control grid and the plate. This is shown in figure 1-30.
