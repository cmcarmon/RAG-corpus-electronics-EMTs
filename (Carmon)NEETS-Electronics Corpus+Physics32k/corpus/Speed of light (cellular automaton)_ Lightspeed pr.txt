While



c


{\displaystyle c}
is an absolute upper bound to propagation speed, the maximum speed of a spaceship in Conway's Game of Life is in fact



c

/

2


{\displaystyle c/2}
. This is because it is impossible to build a spaceship that can move every generation. (This is not true, though, for cellular automata in general; for instance many light-speed spaceships exist in Seeds.) It is, however, possible for objects to travel at the speed of light if they move through a medium other than empty space. Such media include trails of hives, and alternating stripes of live and dead cells.
