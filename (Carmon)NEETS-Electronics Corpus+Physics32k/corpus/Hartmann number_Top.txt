Hartmann number (Ha) is the ratio of electromagnetic force to the viscous force first introduced by Hartmann. It is defined by:





H
a

=
B
L



σ
μ





{\displaystyle \mathrm {Ha} =BL{\sqrt {\frac {\sigma }{\mu }}}}

where
B is the magnetic field
L is the characteristic length scale
σ is the electrical conductivity
μ is the dynamic viscosity
