Let M be a manifold with symplectic form ω. Suppose that a Lie group G acts on M via symplectomorphisms (that is, the action of each g in G preserves ω). Let





g




{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}}
be the Lie algebra of G,






g



∗




{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}^{*}}
its dual, and




⟨
,
⟩
:



g

g


→

R



{\displaystyle \langle ,\rangle :{\mathfrak {g}}^{*}\times {\mathfrak {g}}\to \mathbf {R} }

the pairing between the two. Any ξ in





g




{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}}
induces a vector field ρ(ξ) on M describing the infinitesimal action of ξ. To be precise, at a point x in M the vector



ρ
(
ξ

)

{\displaystyle \rho (\xi )_{x}}
is

{\displaystyle \left.{\frac {d}{dt}}\right|_{t=0}\exp(t\xi )\cdot x,}

where



exp

G


{\displaystyle \exp :{\mathfrak {g}}\to G}
is the exponential map and



⋅


{\displaystyle \cdot }
denotes the G-action on M. Let




ι

ξ
)


ω



{\displaystyle \iota _{\rho (\xi )}\omega \,}
denote the contraction of this vector field with ω. Because G acts by symplectomorphisms, it follows that

)


ω



{\displaystyle \iota _{\rho (\xi )}\omega \,}
is closed for all ξ in

{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}}
.
A moment map for the G-action on (M, ω) is a map



μ
:
M
→



g

{\displaystyle \mu :M\to {\mathfrak {g}}^{*}}
such that

ω


{\displaystyle d(\langle \mu ,\xi \rangle )=\iota _{\rho (\xi )}\omega }

for all ξ in





g




{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}}
. Here



⟨
μ
,
ξ
⟩


{\displaystyle \langle \mu ,\xi \rangle }
is the function from M to R defined by



⟨

⟨

ξ

{\displaystyle \langle \mu ,\xi \rangle (x)=\langle \mu (x),\xi \rangle }
. The moment map is uniquely defined up to an additive constant of integration.
A moment map is often also required to be G-equivariant, where G acts on






g



∗




{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}^{*}}
via the coadjoint action. If the group is compact or semisimple, then the constant of integration can always be chosen to make the moment map coadjoint equivariant; however in general the coadjoint action must be modified to make the map equivariant (this is the case for example for the Euclidean group). The modification is by a 1-cocycle on the group with values in

{\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}^{*}}
, as first described by Souriau (1970).
