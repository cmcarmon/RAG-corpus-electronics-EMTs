At the beginning of 2009, 2 concepts and a backup have been selected for a phase A study focusing on the choice of technologies, with a more detailed definition of the associated concept and the launch of preliminary technological experimentations.
At the end of the phase A, one single concept will finally be retained for the development phases (B/C/D) starting in late 2010. The first technological flight is foreseen around 2015. Following three concepts were initially considered:
MLA, for Airborne Micro Launcher, used a fighter aircraft and a high subsonic flight path releasing a rocket-propelled launcher. It is the smallest system identified as able to reach orbit thanks to the help of the aircraft (human scale).
CATS, for Cheap Access to Space, was a conventional expendable launch system launched from a classical launch pad, probably in Guiana Space Centre. The definition of this second concept is already in discussion and will be fixed during the first part of the phase A.
HORVS, for High Operational Responsive and Versatile System, was another airborne launch system retained as a backup of the first one. It was a rocket dropped from inside of an Airbus A400M Atlas cargo bay with a drogue parachute to slow it down and align vertically before ignition. The concept presents higher risk and complexity due to the method of extraction and safety rules but will have a better performance potential compared to the fighter option.
