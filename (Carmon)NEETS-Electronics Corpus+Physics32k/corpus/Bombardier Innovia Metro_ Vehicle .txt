The Innovia Metro vehicle was built using a lightweight aluminium frame riding on two sets of articulated trucks using small steel wheels. The original Innovia ART 100 cars are 12.7 m (41.7 ft) long. The second generation Innovia ART 200 cars are 16.7 m (54.8 ft) long each and come in articulated pairs.
By 2011, the Innovia ART 200 design has been updated and Bombardier is currently marketing the third generation Innovia Metro 300 (retiring the ART branding). While three vehicle orders have been placed, new vehicles are still in the production stage. Vehicle dimensions are similar to the Innovia ART 200 vehicle, but passenger capacity has been increased through redesigned car layout. The vehicles appear sleeker, with larger windows on the sides of the train, and redesigned windows and headlights on the ends of the cars.
