To find the input impedance of a transmission line, determine the impedance of a single section of
line. The impedance between points K and L, in view B of figure 3-16, can be calculated by the use of
series-parallel impedance formulas, provided the impedance across points M and N is known. But since
this section is merely one small part of a longer line, another similar section is connected to points M and
N. Again, the impedance across points K and L of the two sections can be calculated, provided the
impedance of the third section is known. This process of adding one section to another can be repeated
endlessly. The addition of each section produces an impedance across points K and L of a new and lower
value. However, after many sections have been added, each successive added section has less and less
effect on the impedance across points K and L. If sections are added to the line endlessly, the line is
infinitely long, and a certain finite value of impedance across points K and L is finally reached.
