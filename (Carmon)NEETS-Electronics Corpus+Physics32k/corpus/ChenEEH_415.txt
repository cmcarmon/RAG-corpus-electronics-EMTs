The ﬁrst step in the realization is a Norton source transform
to convert the voltage source into a current source, so that the
source resistor is placed in parallel to C1. This transformation
removes one mesh from the circuit and simpliﬁes the design as
in Figure 4.15(B). Let us write the describing equations to
understand how the components in the active circuit are
derived from the ladder. Choosing as the scaling resistor RS,
we obtain
