Figure 5.17: The original speech segment and the sequence of overlapping Hanning windows applied
to it are shown in the upper portion. Frames were 256 samples long and a Hanning window was applied
with a half-frame overlap. A length-512 FFT of each frame was computed, with the magnitude of the
Ô¨Årst 257 FFT values displayed vertically, with spectral amplitude values color-coded.
