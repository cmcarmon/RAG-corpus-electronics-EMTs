Figure 1.36 shows the inductance and capacitance needed in the
interleaved QSW VRM when it operates at a high switching
frequency. At 10 MHz, the inductance needed is only 9.25 nH
and the capacitance needed is only 5:26 mF. With such a small
inductance and capacitance, very high-power-density VRMs
can be created, and energy storage costs can be dramatically
reduced. Because of today’s device technology, however, most
VRMs’ operating frequencies are lower than 300 kHz. Even at
this frequency, the VRM cannot meet efﬁciency requirements.
When the frequency is increased, the resulting VRM efﬁciency
levels are shown in Figure 1.37. At 10 MHz, the VRM will only
