bases,  etc.,  and  each  joint  might  involve  several 
wires or component leads of substantial diameter. 
 
Electronic solder  
 
A low melting point temperature (typically 185Â°C) 
used for making joints on printed circuit boards. A 
joint  would  normally  involve  a  single  component 
lead  and  its  associated  copper  pad  and  excessive 
temperature  would  have  to  be  avoided  in  order  to 
prevent  damage  both  to  the  component  (whose 
connecting  lead  might  be  of  a  very  short  length)
