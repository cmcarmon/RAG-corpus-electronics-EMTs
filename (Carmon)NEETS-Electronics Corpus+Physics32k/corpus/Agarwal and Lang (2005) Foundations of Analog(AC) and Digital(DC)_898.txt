Let us now briefly examine a transfer curve for the hypothetical, but valid,
inverter shown in Figure 6.51. Referring to Figure 6.51, provided the input volt-
age is lower than VIL, an inverter satisfies the static discipline if it guarantees to
provide an output voltage level greater than VOH. Similarly, for an input voltage
higher than VIH, the inverter guarantees to provide an output that is below VOL.
As discussed for the non-inverting buffer, the magnitude of the slope of
the transfer curve in the forbidden region is greater than unity. Similarly, the
magnitude of the slope of each of the curve segments in the valid regions is less
than unity.
