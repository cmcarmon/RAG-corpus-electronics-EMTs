The first requirement in obtaining velocity modulation is to produce a stream of electrons which are 
all traveling at the same speed. The electron stream is produced by an electron gun. A simplified version 
of an electron gun is shown in figure 2-4A. Electrons emitted from the cathode are attracted toward the 
positive accelerator grid and all but a few of the electrons pass through the grid and form a beam. The 
electron beam then passes through a pair of closely spaced grids, called BUNCHER GRIDS. Each grid is 
connected to one side of a tuned circuit. The parallel-resonant tuned circuit (figure 2-4A) in the 
illustration represents the doughnut-shaped resonant cavity surrounding the electron stream (figure 2-4B). 
The buncher grids are the dashed lines at the center of the cavity and are at the same dc potential as the 
accelerator grid. The alternating voltage which exists across the resonant circuit causes the velocity of the 
electrons leaving the buncher grids to differ from the velocity of the electrons arriving at the buncher 
grids. The amount of difference depends on the strength and direction of the electrostatic field within the 
resonant cavity as the electrons pass through the grids.
