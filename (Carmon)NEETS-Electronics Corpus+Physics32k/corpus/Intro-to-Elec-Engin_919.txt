The windings of either core-type or shell-type three-phase transformers may be connected
in either wye or delta. Four possible combinations of connections for the three-phase, two-
winding transformers are Y–,–Y, –, and Y–Y. These are shown in Figure 11.5.1 with
the transformers assumed to be ideal. The windings on the left are the primaries, those on the
right are the secondaries, and a primary winding of the transformer is linked magnetically with
the secondary winding drawn parallel to it. With the per-phase primary-to-secondary turns ratio
(N1/N2 = a), the resultant voltages and currents for balanced applied line-to-line voltages V and
line currents I are marked in the ﬁgure.
