SPORADIC E.â€”Irregular cloud-like patches of unusually high ionization, called sporadic E, often 
form at heights near the normal E layer. Exactly what causes this phenomenon is not known, nor can its 
occurrence be predicted. It is known to vary significantly with latitude, and in the northern latitudes, it 
appears to be closely related to the aurora borealis or northern lights.
