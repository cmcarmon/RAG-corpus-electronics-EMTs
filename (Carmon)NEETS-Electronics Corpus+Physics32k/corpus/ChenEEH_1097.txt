Many MEMS can be made with the same set of materials
and processes that are used for microelectronics. One of the
hallmarks of the emerging MEMS industry, however, is the use
of numerous other materials and processes. Substrates other
than silicon are being employed for MEMS. Silicon carbide has
been demonstrated to be a good basis for many mechanisms
that can stand higher temperature service than silicon. In
addition there is early and strong interest in the use of syn-
thetic diamond substrates. MEMS are also being made out of
plastic, glass, and ceramics. Processes for taking MEMS made
out of various materials and putting them on plastic or steel
tapes have also been developed.
