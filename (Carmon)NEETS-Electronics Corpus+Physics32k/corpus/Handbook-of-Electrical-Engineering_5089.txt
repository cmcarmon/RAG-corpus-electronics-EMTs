Cotton-Mouton Effect or Magnetic Linear Birefringence
When transmitted light is propagating perpendicular to the magnetization direction, the Ô¨Årst-order isotropic
FR effect will vanish and the second-order anisotropic Cotton-Mouton (CM) effect will dominate. For example,
if  the  direction  of  magnetization  is  along  the  Z  axis  and  the  light  wave  is  propagating  along  the  X  axis,  the
permittivity tensor becomes
