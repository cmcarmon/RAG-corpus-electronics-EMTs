The f (m,n) variable represents the current block of N 2 pixels at
coordinates (m, n), and g(m þ i, n þ j) represents the corres-
ponding block in the previous frame at new coordinates
(m þ i, n þ j). Motion estimation is one of the most compu-
tationally intensive parts of video compression standards, and
some fast algorithms for this have been reported. One such
algorithm is three-step Search, which is the recommended
method for H.261 codecs (to be explained subsequently). It
computes motion displacements up to 6 pixels per frame. In
