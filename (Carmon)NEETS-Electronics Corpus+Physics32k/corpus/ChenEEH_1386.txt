Although incorporating partial reconﬁguration into designs
is becoming popular, their development is still largely an art
involving tedious and error-prone crafting of the circuits at a
very low level. Relatively few studies have been reported that
concern methods for describing reconﬁguration, compilation
tools for conﬁgurable designs, and the automatic detection of
reconﬁgurable regions. In the next section, we shall outline an
approach to exploit run-time reconﬁgurability. An overview of
conﬁgurable computing technology, particularly run-time re-
conﬁguration, will be given in Section 3.3, and current and
future trends will be covered in Section 3.4. Finally, concluding
remarks will be presented in Section 3.5.
