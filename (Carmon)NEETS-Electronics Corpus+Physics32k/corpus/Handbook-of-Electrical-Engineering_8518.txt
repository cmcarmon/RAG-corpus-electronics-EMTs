Normal  execution  of  programs  may  sometimes  be  preempted  if  some  I/O  device  requires  urgent  control
action or servicing. For example, a monitoring device in a computer-controlled industrial process may detect
a dangerous condition that requires the execution of a special service program dedicated to the device. To cause
this  service  program  to  be  executed,  the  device  sends  an  interrupt  signal  to  the  processor.  The  processor
temporarily suspends the program that is being executed and executes the special interrupt service routine. After
providing  the  required  service,  the  processor  switches  back  to  the  interrupted  program.  To  appreciate  the
complexity of the computer system software programs needed to control such switching from one program
task to another and to manage the general movement of programs and data between primary and secondary
storage, consult Tanenbaum [1990].
