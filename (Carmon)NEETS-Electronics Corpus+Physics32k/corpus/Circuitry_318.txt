Power  supplies  can  be  divided  into  two  principal 
categories,  linear  and  non-linear  types.  Linear 
power supplies make use of conventional analogue 
control techniques—the regulating device operates 
through a continuous range of current and  voltage 
according 
load  conditions 
prevailing at the time. Non-linear power supplies,
on the other hand, use digital techniques where the 
regulating device is switched rapidly ‘on’ and ‘off’ 
in  order  to  control  the  mean  current  and    voltage 
delivered  to  the  load.  These  non-linear  power 
supplies  are  commonly  referred  to  as  switched 
mode  power  supplies  or  just  SMPS. Note  that 
SMPS can be used to step-up (boost) or step-down 
(buck) the input voltage. 
  Compared  with 
conventional 
counterparts, the advantages of SMPS are:
