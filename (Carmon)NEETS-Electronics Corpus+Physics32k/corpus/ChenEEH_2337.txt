There are two major types of waveguides, namely of the metal-
lic or dielectric type. Metallic waveguides are closed structures
surrounded by metal and conﬁne the electric ﬁeld inside the
guide. Dielectric waveguides are open structures where the
ﬁeld conﬁnement is obtained from the dielectric constant
discontinuities between the dielectric waveguiding structure
and free space. In addition, a third category of waveguide can
be identiﬁed under the name of planar waveguide, whose
structure is a combination of metal and dielectric assembled
in a planar geometry. Figure 5.1 gives a schematic diagram of
the most common type of waveguide.
