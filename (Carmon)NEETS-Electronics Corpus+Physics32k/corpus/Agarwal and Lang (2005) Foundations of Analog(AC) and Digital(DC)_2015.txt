Let us study the frequency response of our parallel RLC resonant circuit.
Its impedance model is shown in Figure 14.5. Its system function can be written
by inspection using the impedance method as illustrated in Section 14.1.2.
Referring to Figure 14.5, we can write the following expression relating the
output Vp to the input Io:
