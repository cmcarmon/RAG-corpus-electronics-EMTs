KEY CLICKS.â€”Ideally, cw keying a transmitter should instantly start and stop radiation of the 
carrier completely. However, the sudden application and removal of power causes rapid surges of current 
which may cause interference in nearby receivers. Even though such receivers are tuned to frequencies far 
removed from that of the transmitter, interference may be present in the form of "clicks" or "thumps." 
KEY-CLICK FILTERS are used in the keying systems of radio transmitters to prevent such interference. 
Two types of key-click filters are shown in figure 1-26.
