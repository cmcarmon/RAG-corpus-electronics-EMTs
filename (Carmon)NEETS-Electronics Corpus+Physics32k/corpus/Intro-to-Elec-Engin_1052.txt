In almost all engineering applications there arises a need to measure some physical quantities, such
as positions, displacements, speeds, forces, torques, temperatures, pressures, or ï¬‚ows. Devices
known as sensors or transducers convert a physical quantity to a more readily manipulated
electrical quantity (such as voltage or current), such that changes in physical quantity usually
produce proportional changes in electrical quantity. The direct output of the sensor may often
need additional manipulation, known as signal conditioning, for the output to be in a useful
form free from noise and intereference. The conditioned sensor signal may then be sampled and
converted to digital form and stored in a computer for additional manipulation or display. A
typical computer-based measurement system using a sensor is represented in block diagram form
in Figure 12.7.1. Table 12.7.1 lists various sensors and their uses.
