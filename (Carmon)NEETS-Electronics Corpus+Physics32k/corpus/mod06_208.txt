The only difference between the illustrated circuit and the one used to demonstrate triode operation
is the elimination of the battery, Ecc, and the addition of circuit components Rk, the cathode-biasing
resistor; Ck, the cathode ac-bypass capacitor; and a grid resistor (whose purpose will be explained later).
