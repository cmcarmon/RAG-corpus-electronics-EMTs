For all ferromagnetic materials there exists a temperature (the Curie temperature) above which the thermal
disordering  forces  are  stronger  than  the  exchange  forces  that  cause  the  atomic  spins  to  be  parallel.  From
Table 36.3  we  see  that  in  order  of  descending  Curie  temperature  we  have  Co,  Fe,  Ni,  Gd.  From  Fig. 36.4  we
Ô¨Ånd that this is also the order of descending values of the exchange integral, suggesting that high positive values
of  the  exchange  integral  are  indicative  of  high  Curie  temperatures  rather  than  high  magnetic  intensity  in
ferromagnetic materials.
