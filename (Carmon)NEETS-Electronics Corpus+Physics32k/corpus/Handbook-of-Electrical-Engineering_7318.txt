A typical design procedure for these loop ﬁlters would be, ﬁrst, to select the loop damping factor and natural
frequency based on the system requirements. Next, all the loop gain parameters are determined. A convenient
capacitor value may then be selected. The remaining resistors can now be computed from the synthesis equations
presented above.
