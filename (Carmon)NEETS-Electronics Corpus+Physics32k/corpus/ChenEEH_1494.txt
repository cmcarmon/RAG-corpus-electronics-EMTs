Level 6 handles the access to the secondary storage devices.
The programs at this level are responsible for operations such
as positioning the head of a disk drive and transferring blocks
of data. Software at a higher level determines the address of the
data on the disk and places requests for data; the requesting
process then waits at a semaphore until the transfer has been
completed.
