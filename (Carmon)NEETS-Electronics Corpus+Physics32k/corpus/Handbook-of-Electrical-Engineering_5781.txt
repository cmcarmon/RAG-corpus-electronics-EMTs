There are several good books that discuss voltage stability. Kundur [1994] is the most complete in describing
the modeling required to perform voltage stability as well as some of the algebraic model-based methods for
assessing proximity to voltage instability. Van Cutsem and Vournasâ€™ book [1998] provides the only dynamical
systems  discussion  of  voltage  instability  and  provides  a  picture  of  the  various  dynamics  that  play  a  role  in
producing  voltage  instability.  Methods  for  analysis  and  simulation  of  the  voltage  instability  dynamics  are
presented. This analysis and simulation is motivated by a thorough discussion of the network, generator, and
load  dynamics  models  and  their  impacts  on  voltage  instability.  Taylor  [1994]  provides  a  tutorial  review  of
voltage stability, the modeling needed, and simulation tools required and how they can be used to perform a
planning study on a particular utility or system.
