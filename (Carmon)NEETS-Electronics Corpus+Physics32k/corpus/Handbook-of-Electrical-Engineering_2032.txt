Figure 19.4 illustrates the technique for ﬁltering a single-channel source using measured headrelated transfer
functions, in effect, creating a virtual sound source in a given direction of the listener’s auditory space (assuming
plane waves, i.e., inﬁnite source distance). On the left in this ﬁgure, the measurement of head-related transfer
 ear for a moment (subscript l), we need to estimate the so-called free-
functions is shown. Focusing on the
