A  single  crystal  of  iron  has  the  body-centered  structure  at  room  temperature.  If  the  magnetization  as  a
function of applied magnetic ﬁeld is measured, the shape of the curve is found to depend on the direction of
the ﬁeld. This phenomenon is magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Iron has body-centered structure at room temper-
ature, and the “easy” directions of magnetization are those directions parallel to the cube edges [100], [010],
and [001] or, collectively, <100>. The hard direction of magnetization for iron is the body diagonal [111]. At
higher temperatures, the anisotropy becomes smaller and disappears above 300(cid:176)C.
