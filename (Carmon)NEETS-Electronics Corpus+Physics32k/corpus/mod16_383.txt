coil b and deflect the pointer to infinity. This reading indicates a resistance too large to measure. When a
resistance, such as Rx, is connected between the test leads, current also flows in coil a; the pointer tends to
move clockwise. At the same time, coil b still tends to move the pointer counterclockwise. Therefore, the
moving element, composed of both coils and the pointer, comes to rest at a position in which the two
forces are balanced. This position depends upon the value of Rx, which controls the amount of the current
in coil a. Because changes in voltage affect both coils in the same proportion, the position of the moving
element is independent of the voltage. If you short the test leads together, the pointer will come to rest at
zero because the current in coil a is relatively large. Since R3 limits the current, the instrument will not be
damaged under these circumstances. The external appearance of one type of megger is shown in view B
of figure 3-15.
