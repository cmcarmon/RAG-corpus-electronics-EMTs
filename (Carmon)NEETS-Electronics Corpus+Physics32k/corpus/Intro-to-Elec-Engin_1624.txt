Solid-State Control of Synchronous Motors
The speed of a synchronous motor can be controlled by changing its supply frequency. With
variable-frequency control, two modes of operation are possible: true synchronous mode, em-
ployed with voltage source inverters, in which the supply frequency is controlled from an
independent oscillator; and self-controlled mode, in which the armature supply frequency is
changed proportionally so that the armature ﬁeld always rotates at the same speed as the rotor. The
true synchronous mode is used only in multiple synchronous-reluctance and permanent-magnet
motor drives, in applications such as paper mills, textile mills, and ﬁber-spinning mills, because
of the problems associated with hunting and stability. Variable-speed synchronous-motor drives,
commonly operated in the self-controlled mode, are superior to or competitive with induction-
motor or dc-motor variable-speed drives.
