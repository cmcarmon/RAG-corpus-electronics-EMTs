Transmission lines also exhibit capacitive effects. That is,
whenever a voltage is applied to a pair of conductors separated
by a nonconducting medium, charge accumulates, which leads
to capacitance. Similar to the previous development for in-
ductance, the capacitance can be determined based on Gaussâ€™s
