Overview of Pulsed Radars
Basic Concept of Pulse Radar Operation
The basic operation of a pulse radar is depicted in Fig. 41.1. The radar transmits a pulse of RF energy and then
receives returns (reﬂections) from desired and undesired targets. Desired targets may include space, airborne,
and sea- and/or surface-based vehicles. They can also include the earth’s surface and the atmosphere, depending
 Clutter sources include the ground, natural and man-
on the application. Undesired targets are termed 
made objects, sea, atmospheric phenomena, and birds. Short-range/low-altitude radar operation is often con-
strained by clutter since the multitude of undesired returns masks returns from targets of interest such as aircraft.
The range, azimuth angle, elevation angle, and range rate can be directly measured from a return to estimate
target position and velocity. Signature data can be extracted by measuring the amplitude, phase, and polarization
of the return.
