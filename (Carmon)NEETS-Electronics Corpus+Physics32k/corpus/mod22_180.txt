Magnetic tape, as a storage media, offers several useful features. We can store large amounts of data 
in a variety of convenient package sizes (open reels, cartridges, or cassettes). Magnetic tapes are easily 
interchangeable between similar tape units of different computer systems, and tapes are less prone to 
damage than other types of storage media.
