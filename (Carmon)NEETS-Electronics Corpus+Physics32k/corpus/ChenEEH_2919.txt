The cross-range resolution of a conventional radar is propor-
tional to the product of the 3-dB antenna beamwidth and
range. Consider a conventional
imaging radar having an
antenna with 2 m in length and transmitting linear FM pulses
with a bandwidth of 10 MHz. Assume the radar is operated at
2 GHz; then, the 3-dB beamwidth is Du  l=2L ﬃ 0:0375 rad.
If the range from the radar to the ground surface is 20 km,
the cross-range resolution will be Dx ¼ R  Du ¼ 20000
0:0375 ¼ 750 m, much greater than the range resolution,
which is equal to DR ﬃ c=2B ¼ 15 m. The cross-range reso-
lution can be greatly improved by using the synthetic aperture
technique.
