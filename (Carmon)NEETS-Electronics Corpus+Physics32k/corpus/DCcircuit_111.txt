In conventional ﬂow notation, we show the motion of charge according to the (technically
incorrect) labels of + and -. This way the labels make sense, but the direction of charge ﬂow
is incorrect. In electron ﬂow notation, we follow the actual motion of electrons in the circuit,
but the + and - labels seem backward. Does it matter, really, how we designate charge ﬂow
in a circuit? Not really, so long as we’re consistent in the use of our symbols. You may follow
an imagined direction of current (conventional ﬂow) or the actual (electron ﬂow) with equal
success insofar as circuit analysis is concerned. Concepts of voltage, current, resistance, conti-
nuity, and even mathematical treatments such as Ohm’s Law (chapter 2) and Kirchhoff’s Laws
(chapter 6) remain just as valid with either style of notation.
