Norton’s Theorem 
 
Norton’s  Theorem  provides  an  alternative  method 
of
reducing  a  complex  network  to  a  simple 
equivalent  circuit.  Unlike  Thévenin’s  Theorem, 
Norton’s  Theorem  makes  use  of  a  current  source 
rather than a voltage source. The Norton equivalent 
circuit allows us to replace a complicated network 
of  resistances  and  voltage  sources  with  a  simple 
equivalent  circuit  comprising  a  single  constant 
current  source  connected  in  parallel  with  a  single 
resistance (see Fig. 3.20). 
  The  constant  current  source  in  the  Norton 
equivalent  circuit,  Isc, is  simply  the  short-circuit 
current  that  would  flow  if  A  and  B  were  to  be 
linked directly together. The resistance that appears 
in the Norton equivalent circuit, R, is the resistance 
that  would  be  seen  looking  into  the  network 
between  A  and  B  when  all  of  the  voltage  sources 
are  replaced  by  short-circuit  connections.  Once 
again, it is worth noting that, if the voltage sources 
have  any  appreciable 
the 
equivalent circuit must be constructed on the basis 
that  each  voltage  source  is  replaced  by  its  own 
internal resistance.  
  As  with 
the  Thévenin  equivalent,  we  can 
determine how a network will behave by obtaining 
values for Isc and R.
