Kirchhoff’s current law and Kirchhoff’s voltage law describe how lumped-
parameter circuit elements couple at their terminals when they are assembled
into a circuit. KCL and KVL are themselves lumped-parameter simplifications
of Maxwell’s Equations. This section defines KCL and KVL and justifies that
they are reasonable using intuitive arguments.1 These laws are employed in
circuit analysis throughout this book.
