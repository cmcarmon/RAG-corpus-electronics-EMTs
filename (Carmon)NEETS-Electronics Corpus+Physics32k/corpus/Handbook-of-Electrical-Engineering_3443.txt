laminates. To prevent catastrophic thermal failure, the designer must know the maximum allowable tempera-
tures,  acceptable  internal  temperature  differences,  and  the  power  consumption/dissipation  of  the  various
components.  This  information  can  be  used  to  select  the  appropriate  ï¬‚uid,  heat  transfer  mode,  and  inlet
temperature for the coolant and to thus establish the thermal control strategy early in the design process.
