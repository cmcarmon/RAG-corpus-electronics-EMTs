Word processing can accomplish text manipulation 
functions that extend beyond the basic ability to enter 
and change text. Using the default options available in 
most word processing programs allows the creation of 
professional-looking documents. However, a poorly 
designed document can result when the user changes 
the default options and applies special formats, mak-
ing it less appealing to a reader.
