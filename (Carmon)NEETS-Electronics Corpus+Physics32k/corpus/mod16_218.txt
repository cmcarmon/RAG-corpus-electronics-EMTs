To measure the output of microwave radio or radar transmitters, you can use test instruments that
convert rf power to another form of energy, such as light or heat. These instruments can be used to
indirectly measure the power. A method used to measure the effect of a resistor load on a stream of
passing air can also be used to indirectly measure power. Accurate measurement of large-magnitude
power also can be achieved by measuring the temperature change of a water load. The most common type
of power meter for use in this frequency range employs a BOLOMETER.
