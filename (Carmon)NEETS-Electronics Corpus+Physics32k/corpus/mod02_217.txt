A dry electrolytic capacitor consists essentially of two metal plates separated by the electrolyte. In most
cases the capacitor is housed in a cylindrical aluminum container which acts as the negative terminal of the
capacitor (see fig. 3-18). The positive terminal (or terminals if the capacitor is of the multisection type) is a
lug (or lugs) on the bottom end of the container. The capacitance value(s) and the voltage rating of the
capacitor are generally printed on the side of the aluminum case.
