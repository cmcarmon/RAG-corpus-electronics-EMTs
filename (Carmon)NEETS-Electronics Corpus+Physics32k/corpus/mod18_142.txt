The Doppler method is the best means of detecting fast-moving objects that do not require range
resolution. As a moving object approaches the transmitter, it encounters and reflects more waves per unit
of time. The amount of frequency shift produced is very small in relation to the carrier frequency. This is
because the velocity of propagation of the signal is very high compared to the speed of the target.
However, because the carrier frequencies used in radar are high, larger frequency shifts (in the audio-
frequency range) are produced. The amount of shift is proportional to the speed of the reflecting object.
One-quarter cycle shift at 10,000 megahertz will provide speed measurements accurate to a fraction of a
percent.
