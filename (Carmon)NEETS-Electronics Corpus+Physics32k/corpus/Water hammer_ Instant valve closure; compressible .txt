The pressure profile of the water hammer pulse can be calculated from the Joukowsky equation







∂
P


∂
t



=
ρ
a



∂
v


∂
t





{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial P}{\partial t}}=\rho a{\frac {\partial v}{\partial t}}}


So for a valve closing instantaneously, the maximum magnitude of the water hammer pulse is:




Δ
P
=
ρ

a

0


Δ
v


{\displaystyle \Delta P=\rho a_{0}\Delta v}


where ΔP is the magnitude of the pressure wave (Pa), ρ is the density of the fluid (kg m−3), a0 is the speed of sound in the fluid (ms−1), and Δv is the change in the fluid's velocity (ms−1). The pulse comes about due to Newton's laws of motion and the continuity equation applied to the deceleration of a fluid element.
