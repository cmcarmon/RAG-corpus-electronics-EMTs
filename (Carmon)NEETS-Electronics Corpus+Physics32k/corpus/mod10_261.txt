This discussion of electromagnetic wave propagation is concerned mainly with the properties and 
effects of the medium located between the transmitting antenna and the receiving antenna. While radio 
waves traveling in free space have little outside influence affecting them, radio waves traveling within the 
Earth's atmosphere are affected by varying conditions. The influence exerted on radio waves by the 
Earth's atmosphere adds many new factors to complicate what at first seems to be a relatively simple 
problem. These complications are because of a lack of uniformity within the Earth's atmosphere. 
Atmospheric conditions vary with changes in height, geographical location, and even with changes in 
time (day, night, season, year). A knowledge of the composition of the Earth's atmosphere is extremely 
important for understanding wave propagation.
