Planck's law for the spectrum of black body radiation predicts the Wien displacement law and may be used to numerically evaluate the constant relating temperature and peak wavelength (or frequency). According to one form of that law, the black body spectral radiance (power per emitting area per solid angle per unit wavelength) is given by:

{\displaystyle u_{\lambda }(\lambda ,T)={2hc^{2} \over \lambda ^{5}}{1 \over e^{hc/\lambda kT}-1}.}

Differentiating u(λ,T) with respect to λ and setting the derivative equal to zero gives

which can be simplified to give

The form of Wien's displacement law in terms of maximum radiance per unit frequency is derived using similar methods, but starting with the form of Planck's law expressed in those terms rather than wavelength. The effective result is to substitute 3 for 5 in the equation for the peak wavelength. This is solved with x = 2.821439372.
Using the value 4 in this equation solves for the wavelength of the peak in the spectral radiance expressed in radiance per proportional bandwidth, perhaps a fairer way of presenting "wavelength of peak emission". That is solved as x = 3.920690395. The important point of Wiens law, however, is that any such wavelength marker, including the median wavelength (or the wavelength below which a specified percentage of the emission occurs) is proportional to the reciprocal of temperature.
