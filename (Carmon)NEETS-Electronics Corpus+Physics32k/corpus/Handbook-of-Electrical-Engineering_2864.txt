Regardless of the type of assembly, the type of adhesive used, or the curing technique used, adhesive volume
and height must be carefully controlled. Slump of adhesive after application is undesirable because the adhesive
must stay high enough to solidly contact the bottom of the component, and must not spread and contaminate
any pad associated with the component.
