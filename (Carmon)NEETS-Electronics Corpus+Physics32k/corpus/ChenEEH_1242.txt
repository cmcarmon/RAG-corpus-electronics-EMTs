In the past half century, the world of microelectronic and
information techonlogies has experienced a breathtaking and
revolutionary evolution—50s semi-conductor, 60s integrated
circuits, 70s microprocessor, 80s DSP/FPGA/ASIC processors,
90s multimedia multi-processors, to SoC for ubiquitous com-
puting necessary for the ever-more-connected information
world in the 21st century. Subsequently, the ﬁeld of digital
systems and computer engineering has also experienced a fast
change driven by the devices’ technological advances. The
performance of digital systems requires integration of system
architecture, programming systems, and application. While it
is not unusual to have as many as 100 ALU’s per chip today, the
Moore’s law is not directly applicable to performance improve-
ment, which needs also parallelism-friendly software in order
to match the hardware speed-up. To this end, chapters related
to both computer architecture and sotware programming
systems are collected in this section to achieve comprehensive
and balanced coverage.
