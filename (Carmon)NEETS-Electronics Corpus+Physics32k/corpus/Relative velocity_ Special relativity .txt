As in classical mechanics, in Special Relativity the relative velocity







v

B

A





{\displaystyle {\vec {v}}_{\mathrm {B|A} }}
is the velocity of an object or observer B in the rest frame of another object or observer A. However, unlike the case of classical mechanics, in Special Relativity, it is generally not the case that

A

v

B





{\displaystyle {\vec {v}}_{\mathrm {B|A} }=-{\vec {v}}_{\mathrm {A|B} }}

This peculiar lack of symmetry is related to Thomas precession and the fact that two successive Lorentz transformations rotate the coordinate system. This rotation has no effect on the magnitude of a vector, and hence relative speed is symmetrical.
