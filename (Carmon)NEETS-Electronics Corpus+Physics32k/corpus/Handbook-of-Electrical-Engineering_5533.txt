Thyristor-Switched Capacitor, Thyristor-
Controlled Reactor (TSC-TCR) Scheme
This  hybrid  compensator  was  developed  speciﬁ-
cally for utility applications to overcome the disad-
vantages  of  the  FC-TCR  compensators  (behavior
under  large  disturbances  and  loss  characteristic).
Figure 61.29 shows a basic circuit of this compen-
sator. It consists in general of a thyristor-controlled
reactor bank (or banks) and a number of capacitor
banks, each in series with a solid-state switch, which
is composed of either a reverse-parallel-connected
thyristor  pair  or  a  thyristor  in  reverse  parallel  with  a  diode.  The  reactor’s  switch  is  composed  of  a  reverse-
parallel-connected  thyristor  pair  that  is  capable  of  continuously  controlling  the  current  in  the  reactor  from
zero to maximum rated current.
