Mesh Analysis
In a mesh analysis the mesh currents in the network are the variables
and KVL is the mechanism used to determine them. Once all the mesh
currents  have  been  determined,  Ohmâ€™s  law  will  yield  the  voltages
anywhere in e circuit. If the network contains N independent meshes,
then  graph  theory  can  be  used  to  prove  that  N  independent  linear
simultaneous  equations  will  be  required  to  determine  the  N  mesh
currents.
