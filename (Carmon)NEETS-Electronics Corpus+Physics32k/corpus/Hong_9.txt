When multiple components are connected in series, each component must carry 
the same current.  When multiple components are connected in parallel, the total current 
is the sum of the currents flowing through each individual component.  These statements 
are generalized as Kirchoffâ€™s Current Law (KCL), which states that the sum of currents 
entering and exiting a node must be zero, as shown in Figure 1.4.
