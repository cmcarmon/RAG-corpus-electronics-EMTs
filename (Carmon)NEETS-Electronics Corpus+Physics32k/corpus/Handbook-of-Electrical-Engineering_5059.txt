Temperature Sensors
Temperature  is  an  important  parameter  in  many  control  systems,  most  familiarly  in  environmental  control
systems. Several distinctly different transduction mechanisms have been employed. The mercury thermometer
was mentioned in the Introduction as a nonelectrical sensor. The most commonly used electrical temperature
sensors  are  thermocouples,  thermistors,  and  resistance  thermometers.  Thermocouples  employ  the  Seebeck
effect, which occurs at the junction of two dissimilar metal wires. A voltage difference is generated at the hot
junction due to the difference in the energy distribution of thermally energized electrons in each metal. This
voltage is measured across the cool ends of the two wires and changes linearly with temperature over a given
range, depending on the choice of metals. To minimize measurement error the cool end of the couple must be
kept at a constant temperature, and the voltmeter must have a high input impedance.
