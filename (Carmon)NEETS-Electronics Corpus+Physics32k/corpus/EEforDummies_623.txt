resistance RCE is zero and the maximum possible collector current, IC, 
flows. The voltage from collector to emitter, VCE, is nearly zero, so the 
output of the transistor (collector‐to‐emitter) is like a closed switch: All 
current that can flow through it is flowing; the transistor is saturated. In 
this mode, the collector current, IC, is much larger than the base current, 
IB, and since I
