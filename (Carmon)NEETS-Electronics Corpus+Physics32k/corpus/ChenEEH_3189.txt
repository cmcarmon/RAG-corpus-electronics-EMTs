grease coatings. These coatings consist of a polydimethylsilox-
ane (PDMS) polymer, an alumina trihydrate (ATH) or alter-
nate ﬁller for increased tracking and erosion resistance, a
catalyst, and a cross-linking agent. Coating formulations may
also contain a condensation catalyst, adhesion promoter, re-
inforcing ﬁller, and pigments (for color). The coating systems
are dispersed in an organic solvent. Naphtha and 1-1-1 tri-
chloroethane are the solvents commonly used. The solvent
merely acts as a carrier medium to transfer the RTV coating
to the ceramic insulator surface and serves the same purpose as
a thinner for paints. As the solvent evaporates from the surface,
moisture from the air triggers vulcanization, forming a solid
rubber coating. The speed at which this takes place depends on
the type of solvent, cure system chemistry, and relative humid-
ity. Recommended coating thickness is about 0.5 mm (20 ml).
RTV coatings can be applied online (energized application)
or off-line (after de-energizing the circuit). Coatings that use a
combustible solvent like naphtha, however, are not suitable for
energized applications.
