The principle of the feedforward control method in ANC is outlined in the lower half of Fig. 19.6(c) and
(d). The obvious difference to the feedback control method is that the separate reference signal x(t) is used.
Here, cancellation is achieved for the ﬁlter transfer function W = H(s)/C(s) which is most often implemented
by an adaptive ﬁlter. The fact that x(t) reaches the ANC system earlier than e(t) allows for a causal ﬁlter, needed
in  broadband  systems.  However,  a  potential  problem  with  this  method  is  the  possibility  of  feedback  of  the
secondary source signal $y(t) into the path of the reference signal x(t). This is obviously the case when x(t) is
picked up by a microphone in a duct just upstream of the secondary source C. An elegant solution for ANC
in a duct without explicit feedback cancellation is to use a recursive ﬁlter W.
