The friction velocity is often used as a scaling parameter for the fluctuating component of velocity in turbulent flows. One method of obtaining the shear velocity is through non-dimensionalization of the turbulent equations of motion. For example, in a fully developed turbulent channel flow or turbulent boundary layer, the streamwise momentum equation in the very near wall region reduces to:




0

{\displaystyle 0={\nu }{\partial ^{2}{\overline {u}} \over \partial y^{2}}-{\frac {\partial }{\partial y}}({\overline {u'v'}})}
.
By integrating in the y-direction once, then non-dimensionalizing with an unknown velocity scale u∗ and viscous length scale ν/u∗, the equation reduces down to:

{\displaystyle {\frac {\tau _{w}}{\rho u_{\star }^{2}}}={\frac {\partial u^{+}}{\partial y^{+}}}+{\overline {\tau _{T}^{+}}}}
.
Since the right hand side is in non-dimensional variables, they must be of order 1. This results in the left hand side also being of order one, which in turn give us a velocity scale for the turbulent fluctuations (as seen above):

Here, τw refers to the local shear stress at the wall.
