Light waves obey the law of reflection in the same manner as other types of waves. Consider the
straight path of a light ray admitted through a narrow slit into a darkened room. The straight path of the
beam is made visible by illuminated dust particles suspended in the air. If the light beam is made to fall
onto the surface of a mirror or other reflecting surface, however, the direction of the beam changes
sharply. The light can be reflected in almost any direction depending on the angle at which the mirror is
held.
