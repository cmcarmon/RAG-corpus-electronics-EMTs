Schiller layer, also known as iridescent layer, is one of a series of layers formed by sedimenting particles form layers separated by approximately equal distances of the order of the wavelength of light. This gives rise to strong colors when observed in reflected light and the system is said to form iridescent layers or "schiller layers".
