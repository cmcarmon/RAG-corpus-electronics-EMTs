becomes more likely that some latent fabrication defect on a
chip shows up during operation (e.g., a transistor goes into
permanent conduction mode, two wires placed too close to
each other in violation of spacing requirements may get
shorted during operation due to electromigration) (perman-
ent faults)or some external disturbance such as alpha-particle
or electromagnetic radiation can change voltage values in
memory cells or interconnects (soft errors/transient faults).
Reduction of voltage levels also means that digital circuits are
more susceptible to external or internal noise, such as cross talk
causing logic or delay faults. The study and development of
techniques to detect faults in the operation of modern com-
puter and digital systems and to reconÔ¨Ågure around them or
correct them in some manner so that either the system per-
forms correctly in the presence of such faults (fault-tolerant
operation) or shuts down safely in the presence of irrecoverable
errors (fail-safe operation) are thus exceedingly important.
Furthermore, it is also wise to now have a somewhat different
mind-set in designing these complex systems, namely, to invest
some design time and chip real-estate to improving reliability
of these systems, thereby increasing the dependability of a
variety of applications that run on these systems.
