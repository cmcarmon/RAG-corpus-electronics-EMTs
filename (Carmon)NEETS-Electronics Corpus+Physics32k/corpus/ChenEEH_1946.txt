The shift from a static method to a dynamic one, however,
introduces several interesting algorithmic problems. One of
these is the fundamental
issue of minimally changing the
circuit routing to accommodate the needed CSs for reconﬁgu-
ration in a fast and (near-)optimal manner with minimal effect
on the circuit’s electrical properties.
