Newton's Second Law can be written as follows if only the pressure gradient, gravity, and friction act on an air parcel, where the bold symbolizes a vector:

{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {D} {\boldsymbol {U}}}{\mathrm {D} t}}=-2{\boldsymbol {\Omega }}\times {\boldsymbol {U}}-{\frac {1}{\rho }}\nabla p+\mathbf {g} +\mathbf {F} _{\mathrm {r} }}

Here U is the velocity field of the air, Ω is the angular velocity vector of the planet, ρ is the density of the air, p is the air pressure, Fr is the friction, g is the acceleration vector due to gravity and D/Dt is the material derivative.
Locally this can be expanded in Cartesian coordinates, with a positive u representing an eastward direction and a positive v representing a northward direction. Neglecting friction and vertical motion, as justified by the Taylor–Proudman theorem, we have:

With f = 2Ω sin φ the Coriolis parameter (approximately 10−4 s−1, varying with latitude).

with Z the height of the constant pressure surface, satisfying

The validity of this approximation depends on the local Rossby number. It is invalid at the equator, because f is equal to zero there, and therefore generally not used in the tropics.
Other variants of the equation are possible; for example, the geostrophic wind vector can be expressed in terms of the gradient of the geopotential height Φ on a surface of constant pressure:
