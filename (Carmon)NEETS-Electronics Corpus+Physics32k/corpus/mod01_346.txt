Local action may be prevented by using pure zinc (which is not practical), by coating the zinc with 
mercury, or by adding a small percentage of mercury to the zinc during the manufacturing process. The 
treatment of the zinc with mercury is called amalgamating (mixing) the zinc. Since mercury is many 
times heavier than an equal volume of water, small particles of impurities weighing less than mercury will 
float to the surface of the mercury. The removal of these impurities from the zinc prevents local action. 
The mercury is not readily acted upon by the acid. When the cell is delivering current to a load, the 
mercury continues to act on the impurities in the zinc. This causes the impurities to leave the surface of 
the zinc electrode and float to the surface of the mercury. This process greatly increases the storage life of 
the cell.
