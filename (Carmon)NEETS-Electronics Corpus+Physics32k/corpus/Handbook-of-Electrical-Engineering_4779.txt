This design is inconvenient to implement and modern Sawyer Tower circuits have the capability to shift the
reference phase either electronically or digitally to compensate for the loss and static components. A contem-
porary  version,  which  has  compensation  and  no  voltage  loss  across  the  integrating  capacitor,  is  shown  in
Fig. 49.5. The op-amp integrator provides a virtual ground at the input, reducing the voltage loss to negligible
values.  The  output  from  this  circuit  is  the  sum  of  the  polarization  and  the  capacitive  and  loss  components.
These  contributions  can  be  canceled  using  a  purely  real  (resistive)  and  a  purely  imaginary  (capacitive,  90(cid:176)
phaseshift)  compensation  component  proportional  to  the  drive  across  the  sample.  Both  need  to  be  scaled
(magnitude adjustments) to match them to the device being measured and then have to be subtracted (adding
negatively)  from  the  output  of  the  op  amp.  The  remainder  is  the  polarization.  The  hysteresis  for  typical
ferroelectrics is frequency dependent and traditionally the reported values of the polarization are measured at
50 or 60 Hz.
