Filters provide an effective means for the reduction and suppression of electromagnetic interference as they
control  the  spectral  content  of  signal  paths.  The  application  of  ﬁltering  requires  careful  consideration  of  an
extensive list of factors including insertion loss, impedance, power handling capability, signal distortion, tun-
ability,  cost,  weight,  size,  and  rejection  of  undesired  signals.  Often  they  are  used  as  stopgap  measures,  but  if
suppression techniques are used early in the design process, then the complexity and cost of interference ﬁxes
can be minimized. There are many textbooks on ﬁltering, which should be used for speciﬁc applications.
