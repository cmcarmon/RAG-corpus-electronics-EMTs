Friedman (1989) ﬁrst presented the concept of negative non-
zero clock skew as a technique to increase the clock frequency
and circuit performance across sequentially adjacent pairs of
registers. Soon afterward, Fishburn (1990) ﬁrst suggested an
algorithm for computing a consistent clock schedule that is
nontrivial. It is shown in both Friedman’s and Fishburn’s studies
that by exploiting negative and positive clock skew in a local
data path Ri?Rf , a circuit can operate with a clock period TCP
smaller than the clock period achievable by a zero clock skew
schedule while satisfying the conditions speciﬁed by equations
4.5 and 4.6. In fact, Fishburn (1990) determined an optimal
clock schedule by applying linear programming techniques to
solve for TCD to satisfy these equations while minimizing the
objective function Fobjective ¼ TCP.
