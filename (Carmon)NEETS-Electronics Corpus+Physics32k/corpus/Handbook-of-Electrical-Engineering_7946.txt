PLDs are manufactured today in most digital integrated circuit technologies—principally CMOS and bipolar
silicon,  and  gallium  arsenide.  The  programmable  switches  themselves  can  be  fuses,  antifuses,  ﬂoating-gate
MOSFETs, and RAM cells. The ﬂoating-gate devices can usually be erased and reprogrammed, while the RAM-
based devices can be reconﬁgured dynamically. Most PLDs have to be programmed with the aid of a program-
mer, a unit which is able to deliver the appropriate sequences of programming pulses which conﬁgure the PLD’s
arrays of switches in the pattern speciﬁed by the user. Some PLDs can be programmed by sending a data stream
to the device in its application environment. This is in-system programming.
