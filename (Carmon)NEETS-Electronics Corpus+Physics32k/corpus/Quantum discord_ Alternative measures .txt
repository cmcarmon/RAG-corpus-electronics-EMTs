An operational measure, in terms of distillation of local pure states, is the ‘quantum deficit’. The one-way and zero-way versions were shown to be equal to the relative entropy of quantumness.
Other measures of nonclassical correlations include the measurement induced disturbance (MID) measure and the localized noneffective unitary (LNU) distance and various entropy-based measures.
There exists a geometric indicator of discord based on Hilbert-Schmidt distance, which obeys a factorization law, can be put in relation to von Neumann measurements, but is not in general a faithful measure.
Faithful, computable and operational measures of discord-type correlations are the local quantum uncertainty and the interferometric power.
