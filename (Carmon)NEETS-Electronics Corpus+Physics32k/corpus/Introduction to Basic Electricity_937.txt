If the power source cannot be secured, use a 
nonconducting  material  to  remove  the  victim 
from the circuit. Once the victim is free, check 
for signs of breathing and pulse. If trained, begin 
 cardiopulmonary	resuscitation	(cPr)	if neces-
sary. CPR is an emergency procedure performed by 
trained personnel to manually pump blood to the 
brain until further action can be taken by a quali-
fied medically trained team to restore blood circula-
tion and breathing for a person in cardiac arrest and 
 respiratory failure.
