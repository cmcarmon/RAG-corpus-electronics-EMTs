An empirical equation for the anomalous flyby velocity change was proposed by J. D. Anderson et al.:

{\displaystyle {\frac {dV}{V}}={\frac {2\omega _{\text{E}}R_{\text{E}}(\cos \varphi _{\text{i}}-\cos \varphi _{\text{o}})}{c}},}

where ωE is the angular frequency of the Earth, RE is the Earth radius, and φi and φo are the inbound and outbound equatorial angles of the spacecraft. This formula was derived later by Jean Paul Mbelek from the special relativity, leading to one of the possible explanations of the effect. This does not, however, consider the SSN residuals – see "Possible explanations" below.
