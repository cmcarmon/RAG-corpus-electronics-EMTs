Polybutenes are synthetic oils that are derived from the polymerization of oleﬁns. Their long chains, with
isobutene  as  the  base  unit,  have  methyl  group  side  chains  with  molecular  weights  in  the  range  from  300  to
1350. Their electrical properties are comparable to those of mineral oils; due to their low cost, they have been
used as pipe cable ﬁlling oils. Higher viscosity polybutenes have been used as capacitor impregnants. Mixtures
of polybutenes and alkyl benzenes have been used to obtain higher ac breakdown strength with impregnated
paper systems. They are also compatible and miscible with mineral oils.
