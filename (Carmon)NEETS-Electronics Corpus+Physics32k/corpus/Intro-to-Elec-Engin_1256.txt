chronous reactance of 2  per phase and neg-
ligible armature resistance.
(a) If the motor takes a line current of 350 A op-
erating at 0.8 power factor leading, calculate
the excitation voltage and the power angle.
(b) If the motor is operating on load with a power
angle of −20°, and the excitation is adjusted
so that the excitation voltage is equal in mag-
nitude to the terminal voltage, determine the
armature current and the power factor of the
motor.
