As the electric current produces a concentrated magnetic ﬁeld around the coil, this ﬁeld ﬂux
equates to a storage of energy representing the kinetic motion of the electrons through the coil.
The more current in the coil, the stronger the magnetic ﬁeld will be, and the more energy the
inductor will store.
