Although telemetry is usually deﬁned as measurement at a distance, it has also gradually begun to embody
the  concept  of  control  from  a  distance.  In  a  telemeter—the  transmission  of  the  value  of  a  quantity  from  a
remote point—it may only be necessary to observe the reading of an instrument to determine the temperature,
pressure, or vibration of a distant or inaccessible object. One can also feed the output of the instrument into
a control mechanism, however, such as a relay or an alarm device, so that the telemetered signal may activate
or stop a controllable process. Measurement may be performed at one location, indication provided at a second
location, and the remote control function initiated at one of the ﬁrst two locations or even at a third point.
