Some of these other parts — such as wires, connectors, and 
batteries — are essential ingredients in any electronic 
circuit. After all, you’d be hard‐pressed to build an elec-
tronic circuit without wires to connect things or a 
source of power to make things run. As for the other 
parts I discuss in this chapter, you may use them 
only now and then for certain circuits. For example, 
when you need to make some noise, a buzzer sure 
comes in handy — but you may not want to use 
one in every circuit you build.
