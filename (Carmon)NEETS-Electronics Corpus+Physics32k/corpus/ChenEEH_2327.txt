The Smith chart can be used to calculate admittances, a
feature very useful
impedance matching
circuits. The normalized admittance occurs on the reﬂection
coefﬁcient circle, diametrically opposite to the normalized
impedance. Corresponding to the r and x circles, respectively,
the admittance coordinates are the constant conductance
and constant susceptance circles. The upper half of the plane
yields positive susceptances, and the lower half of
the
plane yields negative susceptances. The normalized input
admittance for the example in Figure 4.13 is observed (at
point C) as (1:1 þ j1:08). The net admittance follows from:
