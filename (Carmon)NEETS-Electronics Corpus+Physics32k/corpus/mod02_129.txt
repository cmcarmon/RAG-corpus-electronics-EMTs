 
 INDUCTANCE OF A COILâ€”The property of inductance can be further increased if the conductor 
is formed into a coil. Because a coil contains more loops, more of the conductor can be affected by the 
magnetic field. Inductors (coils) are classified according to core type. The core material is normally either 
air or soft iron.
