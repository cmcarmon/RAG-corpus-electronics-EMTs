Multiple measurements may also be transmitted over the carrier by sampling the output of each transducer
in  rapid  sequence,  a  technique  called  time-division  multiplexing.  The  technique  has  been  used  to  handle  as
many as a million samples per second. It provides for very simple data displays, easier separation of channels
for recording or analysis, and is free of cross talk. If possible, though, it is advantageous to use no multiplexing
at all for concurrent data talking but to use separate radio carriers for each measurement being transmitted.
The  multiplex  telemeter  requires  careful  adjustment  of  subcarrier  frequencies  and  precisely  tuned  Ô¨Ålters  to
separate them at the receiver. This adds to the cost of the equipment and requires considerable experience of
an operator.
