Examination of this theorem indicates that the left and right singular vectors of a Hermitian matrix corre-
sponding to its positive eigenvalues are each equal to the associated eigenvector while those corresponding to
its  negative  eigenvalues  are  equal  to  the  associated  eigenvector  and  its  negative  image.  Furthermore,  any
Hermitian matrix may be uniquely decomposed into the sum of a positive- and negative-semideﬁnite Hermitian
matrix as speciﬁed by (14.106).
