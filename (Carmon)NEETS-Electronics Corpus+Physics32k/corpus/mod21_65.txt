Unless an ammeter is already an integral part of the circuit under test, current measurements are
rarely taken. In the case of a high-resistance circuit, it will contain such a small amount of current that it
cannot be measured accurately with ordinary field test equipment. In lower resistance circuits, current
measurements can be taken only if the ammeter is placed in series with the circuit under test. These
measurements require that a circuit connection be unsoldered or otherwise opened to insert the meter in
series with the circuit. An easier method you may use to obtain a current measurement is to take a voltage
measurement across a known resistance and calculate the current with Ohmâ€™s law. The accuracy of
current measurements depends on the internal resistance of the meter as compared with the resistance of
the external circuit. If the total circuit current is decreased by increasing the load, then the percentage of
error will decrease. Therefore, greater accuracy is obtained if the meter resistance is considerably less
than the load resistance. A method of obtaining greater accuracy of current measurement is to decrease
the total internal meter resistance with respect to load resistance. This is accomplished by connecting two
ammeters in parallel with each other and in series with the circuit in which the current is being measured.
Additional ammeters may be connected in parallel in the same manner for increased accuracy. This
method also increases the range of measurements that can be taken. The arithmetical sum of the
indications of all the parallel meters represents the total current flow in the circuit. You should note that
this is not a common test method and that your test equipment may be damaged if connected incorrectly.
