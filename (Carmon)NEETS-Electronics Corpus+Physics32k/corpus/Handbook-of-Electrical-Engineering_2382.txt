This formulation is called the relaxation-time approximation (RTA) to the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE).
Here, f0 is the Fermi-Dirac distribution function and the second equality in Eq. (22.98) holds for non-degenerate
c = e〈τ〉/m∗ is known as the conductivity
electrons (i.e., those describable by Boltzmann statistics). The quantity µ
mobility, since the quantity neµ
c, and
the Hall concentration as nH = n/r = –1/eRH. Thus, a combined Hall effect and conductivity measurement gives
nH and µ
H, although one would prefer to know n, not nH; fortunately, however, r is usually within 20% of unity,
and is almost never as large as 2. In any case, r can often be calculated or measured so that an accurate value
of  n  can  usually  be  determined.  It  should  also  be  mentioned  that  one  way  to  evaluate  the  expressions  in
Eq. (22.98) is to deﬁne a new variable, u = E/kT, and set u = 10 as the upper limit in the integrals.
