As  the  marketplace  searched  for  lower-cost  systems,  the  FM2 (or  FM/FM)  modulation  technique  evolved,
allowing the use of low-cost FM receivers. Through a high-powered FM modulated carrier on the satellite, a
low-cost audio and data broadcast receiver can be built. This FM/FM modulation technique is widely used to
distribute audio and data on a low-cost basis.
