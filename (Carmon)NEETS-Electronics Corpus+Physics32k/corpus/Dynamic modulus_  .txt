{\displaystyle \tan \delta }

The ratio between the loss and storage modulus in a viscoelastic material is defined as the



tan
⁡
δ


{\displaystyle \tan \delta }
, which provides a measure of dampening in the material.

δ


{\displaystyle \tan \delta }
can also be visualized in vector space as the tangent of the phase angle (



δ


{\displaystyle \delta }
) between the storage and loss modulus.

For example, a material with a tan(delta) greater than one will exhibit more dampening than a material with a



tan

δ


{\displaystyle \tan \delta }
less than one. The reason that a material with a



tan
⁡
δ


{\displaystyle \tan \delta }
greater than one shows more dampening is because the loss modulus of the material is greater than the storage modulus, which means the energy dissipating, viscous component of the complex modulus dominates the material behavior.
