The mopa is both an oscillator and a power amplifier. Power-amplifying stages and frequency-
multiplying stages must be used to increase power and raise the frequency from those achievable in a 
mopa. The main difference between many low- and high-power transmitters is in the number of power-
amplifying stages that are used. Similarly, the main difference between many high- and very-high 
frequency transmitters is in the number of frequency-multiplying stages used.
