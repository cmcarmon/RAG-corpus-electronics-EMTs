While  the  transient  stability  program  assumed  a  fast  transient  response  was  equivalent  to  an  instantaneous
response and only concentrated on the slower response of the synchronous machines, the requirement to model
the fast transient response of traveling waves on transmission lines brought about the development of programs
that treated variables with large time constants as if they were constants and modeled the variables with very
small time constants by differential equations.
