As for the physics of the trick, it is centered around the manipulation of centripetal force. This is the force that acts on an object as it moves around in a circular path. All forces have a direction in which they push, and centripetal force is directed towards the center of the circular path. It can be calculated using the following formula:





F

c


=
(
m
∗

v

2


)


{\displaystyle F_{c}=(m*v^{2})}

Where:





F

c




{\displaystyle F_{c}}
is the centripetal force




m


{\displaystyle m}
is the mass of the object




v


{\displaystyle v}
is the velocity at which the object is moving




r


{\displaystyle r}
is the radius of the circular path. The radius of a circle is the distance from the center of the circle to the outer edge. It is half the length of the diameter.
The velocity of the rider is:




v
=
(
g
∗
r

)


1
2





{\displaystyle v=(g*r)^{\frac {1}{2}}}

Where



r


{\displaystyle r}
is the radius of the sphere.
