In standard cosmology, there are three components of the universe: matter, radiation and dark energy. Matter is anything whose energy density scales with the inverse cube of the scale factor, i.e. ρ ∝ a−3, while radiation is anything which scales to the inverse fourth power of the scale factor ρ ∝ a−4. This can be understood intuitively: for an ordinary particle in a square box, doubling the length of a side of the box decreases the density (and hence energy density) by a factor of eight (23). For radiation, the decrease in energy density is greater, because an increase in spatial distance also causes a redshift.
The final component, dark energy, is an intrinsic property of space, and so has a constant energy density regardless of the volume under consideration (ρ ∝ a0). Thus, unlike ordinary matter, it does not get diluted with the expansion of space, leading to an accelerated expansion, instead of the deceleration expected from a universe containing only ordinary matter.
