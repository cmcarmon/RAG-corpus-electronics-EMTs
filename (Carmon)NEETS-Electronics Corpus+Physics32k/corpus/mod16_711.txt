The signal identify feature can become functional only when the FREQ SPAN/DIV
is set to 500 kHz. When activated (button lit), true signals will change in amplitude
on every sweep. Images and spurious response signals will shift horizontally or go
completely off the CRT display. To ensure that the signal is changing amplitude
every sweep, you should decrease the sweep rate so that each sweep can be
analyzed.
