Memory and emotion, or "affect", are closely related and impact each other simultaneously. One's mood determines the thoughts he or she experiences as well as the memories that are recalled. A common example is that sufferers of depression find it difficult to recall happy memories because they are overwhelmed with negative thoughts. We recall from memory the information that reflects our current state. Memory has been shown to influence decision-making behavior and, considering the reciprocal connection between the two, affect can as well.
