The axis used for the polar coordinates in this analysis is chosen arbitrarily. The quantum number m refers to the projection of the angular momentum in this arbitrarily-chosen direction, conventionally called the z direction or quantization axis. Lz, the magnitude of the angular momentum in the z direction, is given by the formula:





L

{\displaystyle L_{z}=m\hbar .}

This is a component of the atomic electron's total angular momentum,




L



{\displaystyle \mathbf {L} }
, whose magnitude is related to the azimuthal quantum number of its subshell



ℓ


{\displaystyle \ell }
by the equation:




L

ℓ
(
ℓ

)




{\displaystyle L=\hbar {\sqrt {\ell (\ell +1)}}}

where



ℏ


{\displaystyle \hbar }
is the reduced Planck constant. Note this



L
=
0


{\displaystyle L=0}
for



ℓ
=
0


{\displaystyle \ell =0}
and approximates



L

)
ℏ


{\displaystyle L=(\ell +0.5)\hbar }
for high

. It is not possible to measure the angular momentum of the electron in all three axes simultaneously. These properties were first demonstrated in the Stern-Gerlach experiment, by Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach.
The energy of any wave is its frequency multiplied by Planck's constant. The wave displays particle-like packets of energy called quanta. The formula for the quantum number of each quantum state uses Planck's reduced constant, which only allows particular or discrete or quantized energy levels.
