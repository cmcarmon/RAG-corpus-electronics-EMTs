reduce the gains of the RF and IF ampliﬁer stages. A heavily ﬁltered output from the demodulator
is often used to provide an automatic frequency control (AFC) loop through the local oscillator
that can be implemented to have electronic tuning by using a varactor. After manual tuning, the
AFC loop locks the receiver to the selected station. Finally, the response of the demodulator is
fed into the stereo demodulator, which is implemented as shown in Figure 15.2.19(b).
