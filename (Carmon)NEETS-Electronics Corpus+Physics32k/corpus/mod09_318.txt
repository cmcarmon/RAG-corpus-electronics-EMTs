Figure 2-23 shows the common-base configuration of the Pierce oscillator. Feedback is supplied 
from the collector to the emitter through capacitor C1. Resistors RB, RC, and RF provide the proper bias 
conditions for the circuit and resistor RE is the emitter resistor. Capacitors C1 and CE form a voltage 
divider connected across the output. Since no phase shift occurs in the common-base circuit, capacitor C1 
feeds back a portion of the output signal to the emitter without a phase shift. The oscillating frequency is 
determined not only by the crystal but also by the parallel capacitance caused by capacitors C1 and CE. 
This parallel capacitance affects the oscillator frequency by lowering it. Any change in capacitance of 
either C1 or CE changes the frequency of the oscillator.
