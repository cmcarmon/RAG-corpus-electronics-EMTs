 You do not have to look far to find a physical analogy of inductance. Anyone who has ever had to 
push a heavy load (wheelbarrow, car, etc.) is aware that it takes more work to start the load moving than it 
does to keep it moving. Once the load is moving, it is easier to keep the load moving than to stop it again. 
This is because the load possesses the property of INERTIA. Inertia is the characteristic of mass which 
opposes a CHANGE in velocity. Inductance has the same effect on current in an electrical circuit as 
inertia has on the movement of a mechanical object. It requires more energy to start or stop current than it 
does to keep it flowing.
