FDMA  implies  that  several  individual  carriers  co-exist  in  the  transmit  ampliﬁers.  In  order  to  limit  inter-
modulation products caused by non-linearities, the ampliﬁers must be operated in a backed off condition relative
to their saturated output power. For example, to limit third-order intermodulation power for two carriers in
a conventional traveling wave tube (TWT) ampliﬁer to Å –20 dB relative to the carrier, its input power must
be reduced (input backoff) by about 10 dB relative to the power that would drive it to saturation. The output
power  of  the  carriers  is  reduced  by  about  4  to  5  dB  (output  backoff).  Ampliﬁers  with  ﬁxed  bias  levels  will
consume power even if no carrier is present. Therefore, DC-to-RF efﬁciency degrades as the operating point
is backed off. For ampliﬁers with many carriers, the intermodulation products have a noise-like spectrum and
the noise power ratio is a good measure of multi-carrier performance.
