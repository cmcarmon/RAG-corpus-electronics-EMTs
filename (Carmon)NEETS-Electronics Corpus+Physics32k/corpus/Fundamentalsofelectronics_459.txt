It
is interesting that one system that does not support this 5 kHz bandwidth is the telephone: Telephone
systems act like a bandpass ﬁlter passing energy between about 200 Hz and 3.2 kHz. The most important
consequence of this ﬁltering is the removal of high frequency energy. In our sample utterance, the “ce” sound
in “Rice” contains most of its energy above 3.2 kHz; this ﬁltering eﬀect is why it is extremely diﬃcult to
distinguish the sounds “s” and “f” over the telephone. Try this yourself: Call a friend and determine if they
can distinguish between the words “six” and “ﬁx.”
If you say these words in isolation so that no context
