The astute observer will notice that the ohms-per-volt rating of any meter is determined by
a single factor: the full-scale current of the movement, in this case 1 mA. ”Ohms per volt” is the
mathematical reciprocal of ”volts per ohm,” which is deﬁned by Ohm’s Law as current (I=E/R).
Consequently, the full-scale current of the movement dictates the Ω/volt sensitivity of the meter,
