With Q1 saturated, a large current flows through R5. The meter would measure approximately 0 
volts (ground potential) at point (C). Notice that point (B) is located between point (C) (at 0 volts) and  
+V BB (at +6 volts). The meter would measure a positive voltage (between 0 volts and +6 volts) at the base 
of Q2 (point (B)).
