COULOMB'S LAWÂ—Also called the LAW OF ELECTRIC CHARGES or the LAW OF 
ELECTROSTATIC ATTRACTION. Coulomb's Law states that charged bodies attract or repel each 
other with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their individual charges and inversely 
proportional to the square of the distance between them [1].
