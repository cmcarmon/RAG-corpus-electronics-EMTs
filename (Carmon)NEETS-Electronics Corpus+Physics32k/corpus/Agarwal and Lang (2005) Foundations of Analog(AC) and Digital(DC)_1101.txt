When the total variable comprises a DC operating value plus a small pertur-
bation around the operating point, our models for the response of circuits to the
perturbations will be linear and hence very simple. However, our incremental
or small-signal models will apply only over a small range around the operating
point. In contrast, our models of the previous chapter captured the behavior
of the amplifier over a wide range of operation, but the models were complex.
Separate models over different regions had to be spliced together to obtain the
overall characteristics. Furthermore, the models were nonlinear. Such a tradeoff
between complexity of the model and the range over which it is valid is not
uncommon in modeling systems. In engineering practice, both extremes of
models are useful: complex accurate models and simple approximate models.
This chapter discusses small-signal models, which are simple models whose
range of applicability is limited. Despite their limitations, the simple models
are surprisingly useful engineering tools even when applied outside their strict
range of validity.
