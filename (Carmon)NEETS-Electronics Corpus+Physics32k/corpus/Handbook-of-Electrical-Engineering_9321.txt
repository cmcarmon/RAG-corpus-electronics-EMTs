First, a procedure (function) should address a single problem. If more than one problem is addressed by the
same  procedure,  a  reader  of  the  program  text  experiences  a  distracting  shift  in  subject,  which  makes  the
comprehension  of  the  text  unnecessarily  difÔ¨Åcult.  For  example,  a  program  involved  in  interest  calculations
should not also solve calendar problems (such as how many days are between March 15 and June 27) but use
a calendar module that provides the abstract data type Date to obtain the desired results. Similarly, a sorting
procedure should not be burdened with the details of comparing records. Instead, a different function should
be written that contains the details of the comparison, and this function should then be invoked by the sorting
program. The program fragments in Example 1, written in the programming language C, illustrate the sepa-
ration of these levels of concern.
