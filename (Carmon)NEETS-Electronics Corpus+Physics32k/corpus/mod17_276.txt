While permanent magnet speakers perform reasonably well in the audio range, they have limitations.
Most Navy speakers reproduce low audio frequencies quite well, mid-band frequencies fairly well, and
high frequencies quite poorly. Letâ€™s see why. When the speaker is constructed, only a limited number of
turns may be built into the voice coil. This gives us a fixed inductance. At low frequencies, the inductive
reactance of the voice coil is relatively low, and large audio currents flow. This provides a strong
magnetic field around the voice coil and a strong interaction with the field of the permanent magnet. Low
frequency response is excellent. At midband frequencies, inductive reactance increases and less current
flows in the voice coil. This produces less magnetic field and less interaction. Midband response is still
acceptable in a properly designed speaker. At high audio frequencies inductive reactance is quite high,
and little current flows in the voice coil. This results in a greatly reduced voice coil field and little
interaction with the permanent magnetic field. Also at high frequencies the interwinding capacitance of
the voice coil tends to shunt some of the high audio frequencies, which further reduces the high frequency
response.
