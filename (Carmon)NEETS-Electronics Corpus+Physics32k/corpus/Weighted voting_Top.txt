Weighted voting is an electoral system in which not all voters have the same amount of influence over the outcome of an election. Instead votes of different voters are given different weight.
This type of electoral system is used in shareholder meetings, where votes are weighted by the number of shares that each shareholder owns, and the United States Electoral College. Another example is the European council, where the number of votes of each member state is proportional to the size of that state's population.
