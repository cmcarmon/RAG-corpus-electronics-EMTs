In a real springâ€“mass system, the spring has a non-negligible mass



m


{\displaystyle m}
. Since not all of the spring's length moves at the same velocity



v


{\displaystyle v}
as the suspended mass



M


{\displaystyle M}
, its kinetic energy is not equal to





1
2


m

v

2




{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}mv^{2}}
. As such,



m


{\displaystyle m}
cannot be simply added to



M


{\displaystyle M}
to determine the frequency of oscillation, and the effective mass of the spring is defined as the mass that needs to be added to



M


{\displaystyle M}
to correctly predict the behavior of the system.
