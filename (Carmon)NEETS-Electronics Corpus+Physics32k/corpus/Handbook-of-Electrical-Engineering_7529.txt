on  switching  a  ﬁxed  amount  of  bias  current  that  is  less  than  the  saturation  amount  between  two  different
transistors. The basic circuit found in the ECL family is the differential ampliﬁer. One side of the differential
ampliﬁer is controlled by a bias circuit and the other is controlled by the logic inputs to the gate. This logic
family is also referred to as current-mode logic (CML) because of its current switching operation.
