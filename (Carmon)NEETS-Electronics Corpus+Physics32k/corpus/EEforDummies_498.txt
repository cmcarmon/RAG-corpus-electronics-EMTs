▶✓ Blocking AC: A choke is an inductor used to prevent a signal from pass-
ing through it to another part of a circuit. Chokes are often used in radio 
transmission systems to prevent the transmitted signal (an AC wave-
form) from shorting out through the power supply. By blocking the signal 
from traveling through a path to ground, a choke enables the signal to 
follow its intended path to the antenna, where it can be transmitted.
