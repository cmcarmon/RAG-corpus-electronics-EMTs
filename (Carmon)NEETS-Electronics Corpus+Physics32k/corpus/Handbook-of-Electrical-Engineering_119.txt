The  oscillator  voltage  is  driven  across  a  low  value  of  resistance,  R,
about  1/100  of  the  anticipated  rf  resistance  of  the  LC  combination,  to
assure that the measurement will not be in error by more than 1%. For
most measurements, R will be about 0.10 W and should have a voltage
of  0.1 V.  Most  oscillators  cannot  be  operated  into  this  low  impedance,
so a step-down matching transformer must be employed. Make C as large as convenient to minimize the ratio
of the impedance looking from the voltmeter to the impedance of the test circuit. The LC circuit is then tuned
to resonate and the resultant voltage measured. The value of Q may then be equated
