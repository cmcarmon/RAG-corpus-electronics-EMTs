Project	#	4	â€“	The	Remote	Tester
The	Remote	Tester,	as	its	name	suggests,	is	a	circuit	that	checks	whether	or
not	a	remote	control	is	working.	Behind	it,	the	idea	is	focused	on	the
sufficient	amount	of	signals	that	the	IR	receiver	is	getting.	If	it	receives
enough	signals,	the	LED	lights	up,	which	means	that	a	particular	remote
control	is	functioning;	conversely,	if	the	LED	remains	as	is,	it	is	an
indication	of	a	faulty	component	in	the	device.
