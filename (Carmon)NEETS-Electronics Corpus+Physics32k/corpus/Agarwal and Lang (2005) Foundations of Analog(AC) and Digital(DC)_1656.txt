where C is the total driven downstream capacitance, V is the power sup-
ply voltage, and f is the switching frequency. As digital circuits become
ever faster,
in order to
reduce dynamic losses, and hence reduce the associated thermal man-
agement problems, CMOS logic circuits are built from MOSFETs having
ever decreasing gate-to-source capacitances, and are built to operate from
ever decreasing power supply voltages.6 Also, circuits that are not in use are
now commonly shut down to avoid dynamic losses.
