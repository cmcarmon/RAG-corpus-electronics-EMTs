reach the plate. Thus, the tube has the advantage of high power output and high efficiency. An added
advantage to this type of grid arrangement is high-power sensitivity. This means that the tube can respond
to much smaller input signals than the conventional electron tube. The reason for this is obvious; many
more electrons reach the plate from the cathode. Therefore, large plate currents can be obtained from
relatively weak input signals.
