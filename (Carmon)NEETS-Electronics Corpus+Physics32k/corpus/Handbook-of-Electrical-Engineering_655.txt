Representation of Bandpass Signals
A signal x(t) is referred to as a bandpass signal if its energy is nonnegligible only in a frequency band of total
extent 2BW centered about a carrier frequency fc. Every bandpass signal can be expressed in terms of a slowly
varying signal Ëœx(t) and a complex exponential
