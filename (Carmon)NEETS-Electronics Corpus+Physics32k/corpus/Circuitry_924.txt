32. A zener diode rated at 5.6 V is connected to a 
12 V d.c. supply via a fixed series resistor of 56 
G. Determine the current flowing in the resistor, 
the  power  dissipated  in  the  resistor  and  the 
power dissipated in the zener diode. [Page 122] 
33. An  amplifier  has  identical  input  and  output 
resistances  and  provides  a  voltage  gain  of  26 
dB. Determine the output voltage produced if an 
input of 50 mV is applied. [Page 388]
