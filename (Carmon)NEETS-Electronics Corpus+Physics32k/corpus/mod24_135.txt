Wavefronts are required to remain in phase for light to be transmitted along the fiber. Consider the
wavefront incident on the core of an optical fiber as shown in figure 2-15. Only those wavefronts incident
on the fiber at angles less than or equal to the critical angle may propagate along the fiber. The wavefront
undergoes a gradual phase change as it travels down the fiber. Phase changes also occur when the
wavefront is reflected. The wavefront must remain in phase after the wavefront transverses the fiber twice
and is reflected twice. The distance transversed is shown between point A and point B on figure 2-15. The
reflected waves at point A and point B are in phase if the total amount of phase collected is an integer
multiple of 2p radian. If propagating wavefronts are not in phase, they eventually disappear. Wavefronts
disappear because of destructive interference. The wavefronts that are in phase interfere with the
wavefronts that are out of phase. This interference is the reason why only a finite number of modes can
propagate along the fiber.
