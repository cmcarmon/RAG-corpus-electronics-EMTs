Current measurement using a shunt resistor and voltmeter is particularly well-suited for
applications involving particularly large magnitudes of current.
In such applications, the
shunt resistorâ€™s resistance will likely be in the order of milliohms or microohms, so that only a
modest amount of voltage will be dropped at full current. Resistance this low is comparable to
wire connection resistance, which means voltage measured across such a shunt must be done
so in such a way as to avoid detecting voltage dropped across the current-carrying wire con-
nections, lest huge measurement errors be induced. In order that the voltmeter measure only
the voltage dropped by the shunt resistance itself, without any stray voltages originating from
wire or connection resistance, shunts are usually equipped with four connection terminals:
