In this way, we express how the components used to build the system aﬀect the input-output relationship.
Because this analysis was made with ideal circuit elements, we might expect this relation to break down if
the input amplitude is too high (Will the circuit survive if the input changes from 1 volt to one million volts?)
or if the source’s frequency becomes too high. In any case, this important way of expressing input-output
relationships—as a ratio of output to input—pervades circuit and system theory.
