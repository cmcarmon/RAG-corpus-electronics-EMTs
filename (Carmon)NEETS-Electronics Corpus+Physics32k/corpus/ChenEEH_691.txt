An important aspect of RAMs are the access times, both for
read and write. In principle, these should be balanced as much
as possible as the worst case determines the maximum clock
rate from the point of view of the periphery. It should be noted
that the RAM access itself can be either ‘‘asynchronous’’ or
‘‘clocked.’’ Most individual RAM chips are of the asynchronous
type. The evolution of putting more and more RAM on chip
has led to a state deﬁned by stand-alone memories that are
