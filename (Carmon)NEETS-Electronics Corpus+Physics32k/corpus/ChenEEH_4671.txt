j ¼ 1, 2, . . ., r) are the weights; ^vvj and ^vv are the bias terms;
and H is the squashing function that should be continuous,
nonconstant, bounded, monotonically increasing (Funahashi,
1989), and differentiable (Chin and Coats, 1986). A hyperbolic
tangent function is used for H in this work.
Denote the network output by y ¼ F (x, A), where A repre-
sents the network structure and contains all the network
weights and bias terms (i.e., A ¼ [^vv, v1, . . ., vp, ^vv1, . . .,
^vvr , v11, . . ., v1r , v21, . . ., v2r , . . ., vp1, . . ., vpr ]T ). Deﬁne
the change of the network output with respect to A as:
