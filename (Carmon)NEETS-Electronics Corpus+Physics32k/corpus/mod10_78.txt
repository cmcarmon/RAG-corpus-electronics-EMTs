The amount of incident wave energy reflected from a given surface depends on the nature of the
surface and the angle at which the wave strikes the surface. As the angle of incidence increases, the
amount of wave energy reflected increases. The reflected energy is the greatest when the wave is nearly
parallel to the reflecting surface. When the incident wave is perpendicular to the surface, more of the
energy is transmitted into the substance and less is reflected. At any incident angle, a mirror reflects
almost all of the wave energy, while a dull, black surface reflects very little.
