Example: A parallel circuit consists of five resistors. The value of each resistor is known and the
current through R1 is known. You are asked to calculate the value for total resistance, total power, total
current, source voltage, the power used by each resistor, and the current through resistors R2,  R 3, R4, and
R5.
