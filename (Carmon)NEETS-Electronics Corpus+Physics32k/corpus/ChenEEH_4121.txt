In QPSK, the carrier phase can change only once every 2T
seconds. If from one 2T interval to the next, neither bit stream
changes sign, the carrier phase remains the same. If one com-
ponent aI (t ) or aQ(t) changes sign, a phase shift of p=2 occurs.
If both components, I and Q change sign, however then a phase
shift of p or 1808 occurs. When this 1808 phase shift is ﬁltered by
the transmitter and receiver ﬁlters, it generates a change in
amplitude of the detected signal and causes additional errors.
Notice the 1808 shift at the end of bit interval 4 in Figure 4.4.
