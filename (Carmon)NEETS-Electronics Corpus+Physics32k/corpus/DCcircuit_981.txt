In this equation, we represent the common directions of currents by their sums through
common resistors. For example, resistor R3, with a value of 100 â„¦, has its voltage drop rep-
resented in the above KVL equation by the expression 100(I1 + I2), since both currents I1 and
I2 go through R3 from right to left. The same may be said for resistor R1, with its voltage
drop expression shown as 150(I1 + I3), since both I1 and I3 go from bottom to top through that
resistor, and thus work together to generate its voltage drop.
