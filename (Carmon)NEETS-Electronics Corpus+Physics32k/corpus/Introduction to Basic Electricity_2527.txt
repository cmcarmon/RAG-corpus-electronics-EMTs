The level control sets the amplitude that the trig-
gering signal must exceed before the sweep genera-
tor starts. If the level control is in the AUTO position, 
the oscilloscope is free running. Turning the level con-
trol results in a blank screen when no signal is present.  
The level control is turned to a point where the trace on 
the  oscilloscope goes out, and then it is turned back to 
where the trace reappears. At this point, a stable presen-
tation is on the screen. By using the triggering and level 
controls together to synchronize the sweep generator with 
the input signal, a stable trace can be obtained on the CRT.
Before use, the oscilloscope should be checked to 
determine that it is not faulty. Misadjusted controls can 
give false readings. Most oscilloscopes have a built-in 
test signal for setup. Initially the controls should be set 
in the following positions:
Intensity, Focus, Astigmatism, and Position  controls 
(set to the center of their range):
