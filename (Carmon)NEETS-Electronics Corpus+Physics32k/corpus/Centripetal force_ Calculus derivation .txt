In two dimensions, the position vector

Assume uniform circular motion, which requires three things.
The object moves only on a circle.
The radius of the circle



r


{\displaystyle r}
does not change in time.
The object moves with constant angular velocity



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }
around the circle. Therefore,



θ

t


{\displaystyle \theta =\omega t}
where



t


{\displaystyle t}
is time.
Now find the velocity





v




{\displaystyle {\textbf {v}}}
and acceleration





a




{\displaystyle {\textbf {a}}}
of the motion by taking derivatives of position with respect to time.

negative shows that the acceleration is pointed towards the center of the circle (opposite the radius), hence it is called "centripetal" (i.e. "center-seeking"). While objects naturally follow a straight path (due to inertia), this centripetal acceleration describes the circular motion path caused by a centripetal force.
