If a bar magnet is suspended freely on a string, as shown in figure 1-9, it will align itself in a north
and south direction. When this experiment is repeated, it is found that the same pole of the magnet will
always swing toward the north magnetic pole of the earth. Therefore, it is called the north-seeking pole or
simply the NORTH POLE. The other pole of the magnet is the south-seeking pole or the SOUTH POLE.
