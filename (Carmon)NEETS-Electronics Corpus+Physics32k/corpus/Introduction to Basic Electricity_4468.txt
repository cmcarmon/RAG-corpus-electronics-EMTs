As long as the clock input is low, the S and R in-
puts can be changed without affecting the state of the 
flip-flop. The only time that the effects of the S and 
R inputs are felt is when a clock pulse occurs. This is 
 referred to as synchronous operation. The flip-flop 
operates in step with the clock. Synchronous operation
