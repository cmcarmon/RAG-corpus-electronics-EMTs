If the dielectric material is not altered during service, elec-
trical characteristics like power frequency wet withstand or
ﬂashover, lightning and switching surges are deﬁned by dry
arcing distance. The shape or proﬁle of the dielectric, which
determines the leakage distance, is important for the contam-
ination performance.
