Simpliﬁed block diagrams for CW Doppler radars are shown in Fig. 41.8. The transmitter is a single-frequency
source, and leakage (or coupling) of a small amount of transmitter power serves as a local oscillator signal in
the mixer. The transmitted signal will produce a Doppler-shifted return from a moving target. In the case of
scatterometer measurements, where, for example, terrain reﬂectivity is to be measured, the relative motion may
be  produced  by  moving  the  radar  (perhaps  on  a  vehicle)  with  respect  to  the  stationary  target  [Wiltse  et al.,
1957].  The  return  signal  is  collected  by  the  antenna  and  then  also  fed  to  the  mixer.  After  mixing  with  the
transmitter  leakage,  a  difference  frequency  will  be  produced  which  is  the  Doppler  shift.  As  indicated  in
Table 41.8, this difference is apt to range from low audio to over 100 kHz, depending on relative speeds and
choice of microwave frequency. The Doppler ampliﬁer and ﬁlters are chosen based on the information to be
obtained, and this determines the ampliﬁer bandwidth and gain, as well as the ﬁlter bandwidth and spacing.
The transmitter leakage may include reﬂections from the antenna and/or nearby clutter in front of the antenna,
as well as mutual coupling between antennas in the two-antenna case.
