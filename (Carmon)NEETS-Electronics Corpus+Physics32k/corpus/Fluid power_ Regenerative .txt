In a regenerative circuit, a double acting cylinder is used. This cylinder has a pump that has a fixed output. The use of a regenerative circuit permits use of a smaller size pump for any given application. This works by re-routing the fluid to the cap instead of back to the tank . For example, in a drilling process a regenerative circuit will allow drilling at a consistent speed, and retraction at a much faster speed. This gives the operator a faster and more precise production.
