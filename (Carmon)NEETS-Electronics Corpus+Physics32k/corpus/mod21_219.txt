Triac is General Electricâ€™s trade name for a silicon, gate-controlled, full-wave, ac switch, as shown in
figure 2-13. The device is designed to switch from a blocking state to a conducting state for either polarity
of applied voltages and with either positive or negative gate triggering. Like a conventional SCR, the
Triac is an excellent solid-state device for controlling current flow. You can make the Triac conduct by
using the same method used for an SCR, but the Triac has the advantage of being able to conduct equally
well in either the forward or reverse direction.
