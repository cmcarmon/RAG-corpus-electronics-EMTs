Figure 25-2 shows the relationship of the current 
to the applied voltage. In a purely inductive circuit, 
the current lags behind the applied voltage by 90°. 
Another way of stating this is that the applied voltage 
leads the current by 90° in a pure inductive current. 
This can be represented by the acronym ELI. Voltage 
(E) leads current (I) in an inductive (L) circuit.
