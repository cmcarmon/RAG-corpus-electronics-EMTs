The fact is, there is a very real, effective RESISTANCE between cathode and plate. It is not lumped
in a resistor, but the circuit may be analyzed as if it is. The plate resistance of a given tube, Rp, can be
calculated by applying Ohmâ€™s law to the values of Ep and Ip. Figure 1-14 is a typical diode Ep - Ip curve.
The plate resistance has been figured for Rp under three different conditions, as follows:
