Neural Observer
The nonlinear functional mapping properties of neural networks are central to their use in identiﬁcation and
control [Chow and Teeter, 1995; Hunt et al., 1992; Poggio and Girosi, 1990; Teeter and Chow, 1998; Teeter et al.
1994]. Although a number of key theoretical problems remain, results pertaining to the approximation capa-
bilities of neural networks demonstrate that they have great promise in the modeling of nonlinear systems. An
important  question  in  system  identiﬁcation  is  whether  a  system  under  study  can  be  adequately  represented
within a given model structure [Hunt et al., 1992]. In the absence of such concrete theoretical results for neural
networks,  it  is  usually  assumed  that  the  system  under  consideration  belongs  to  the  class  of  systems  that  the
chosen network is able to represent. Two system identiﬁcation techniques are now introduced: forward modeling
and inverse modeling.
