We will now discuss the dual-trace components of the scope. You will use these components to
determine the amplitude of a signal. Notice in figure 6-19 that the highlighted section at the upper left of
the scope looks just the same as the section at the lower left of the scope. This reveals the dual-trace
capability section of the scope. The upper left section is the CH (channel) 1 input and is the same as the
CH 2 input at the lower left. An input to both inputs at the same time will produce two independent traces
on the CRT and use the dual-trace capability of the scope.
