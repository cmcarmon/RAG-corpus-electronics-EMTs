Road surface conditions such as moisture on the road, snow, ice (particularly black ice), debris or sand, oil or other fluids, can cause skidding at much lower force levels or velocities than under normal conditions. Moisture can cause aquaplaning, also known as hydroplaning, where water builds up in front of and under tires and causes loss of tire grip.
