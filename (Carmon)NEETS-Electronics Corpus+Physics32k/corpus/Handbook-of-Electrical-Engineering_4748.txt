Examples of the classes of materials that are technologically important are given in Table 49.1. It is apparent
that  many  materials  exhibit  electric  phenomena  which  can  be  attributed  to  ferroelectric,  piezoelectric,  and
electret
 materials. It is also clear that vastly different materials (organic and inorganic) can exhibit ferroelec-
tricity or piezoelectricity, and many have actually been commercially exploited for these properties.
