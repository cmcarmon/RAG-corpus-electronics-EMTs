The Principle of Moments, also known as Varignon's theorem (not to be confused with the geometrical theorem of the same name) states that the sum of torques due to several forces applied to a single point is equal to the torque due to the sum (resultant) of the forces. Mathematically, this follows from:

{\displaystyle (\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {F} _{1})+(\mathbf {r} \times \mathbf {F} _{2})+\cdots =\mathbf {r} \times (\mathbf {F} _{1}+\mathbf {F} _{2}+\cdots ).}
