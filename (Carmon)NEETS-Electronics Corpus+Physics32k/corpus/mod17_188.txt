The ability of a receiver to reproduce weak signals is a function of the sensitivity of a receiver. The
weaker a signal that can be applied to a receiver and still produce a certain value of signal output, the
better the sensitivity rating. Sensitivity of a receiver is measured under standardized conditions. It is
expressed in terms of the signal voltage, usually in the microvolts that must be applied to the antenna
input terminals to give an established level of the output. The output may be an ac or dc voltage measured
at the detector output or a power measurement (measured in decibels or watts) at the loudspeaker or
headphone terminals.
