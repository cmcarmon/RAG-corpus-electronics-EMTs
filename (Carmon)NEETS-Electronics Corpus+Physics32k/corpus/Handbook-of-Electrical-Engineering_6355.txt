The  channel  encoder  uses  sophisticated  modulating  techniques  to  accomplish  the  goals  of  interference
cancellation and high spectral efÔ¨Åciency. Methods of interference cancellation include expansion of time and
frequency diversity of the transmitted information, as well as the inclusion of error correction codes in the data
stream.  Time  diversity  involves  transmitting  the  same  information  multiple  times  by  using  a  predetermined
time interval. Frequency diversity, such as that produced by spread-spectrum, multiple-carrier, or frequency-
hopping  systems,  provides  the  means  to  transmit  identical  data  on  several  different  frequencies  within  the
bandwidth of the system. At the receiver, real-time mathematical processes are used to locate the required data
on a known frequency at a known time. If the initial information is found to be unusable because of signal
interference,  the  receiver  simply  uses  the  same  data  found  on  another  frequency  and/or  at  another  time,
producing seamless demodulation.
