Electrostriction  is  the  origin  of  piezoelectricity  in  ferroelectric  materials,  in  both  conventional  ceramic
 as well as in organic polymer ferroelectrics such as PVDF copolymers [Furukawa
ferroelectrics such as BaTiO
 and
and Seo, 1990]. In a ferroelectric material, that exhibits both spontaneous and induced polarizations,
