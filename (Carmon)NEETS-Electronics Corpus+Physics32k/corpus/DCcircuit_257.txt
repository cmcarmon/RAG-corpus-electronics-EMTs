How AC affects the body depends largely on frequency. Low-frequency (50- to
60-Hz) AC is used in US (60 Hz) and European (50 Hz) households; it can be more
dangerous than high-frequency AC and is 3 to 5 times more dangerous than DC
of the same voltage and amperage. Low-frequency AC produces extended muscle
contraction (tetany), which may freeze the hand to the current’s source, prolonging
exposure. DC is most likely to cause a single convulsive contraction, which often
forces the victim away from the current’s source. [1]
