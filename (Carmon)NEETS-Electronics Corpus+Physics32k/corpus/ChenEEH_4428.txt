The four passiﬁcation methods in Figure 3.5 series, feedback,
feed-forward, and hybrid passiﬁcation are given in Kelkar
and Joshi (1997) for ﬁnite-dimensional linear time-invariant
nonpassive systems as shown. Once passiﬁed, the system can
be controlled by any MSPR or weakly SPR (WSPR) controller
(Isidori et al., 1999). In Figure 3.5, the system with input u(t)
and output ym(t) (G(s)) represents the passiﬁed system. The
type of passiﬁcation to be used depends on the dynamic
characteristics of the unpassiﬁed plant. For example, the
system having unstable poles will require feedback passiﬁca-
tion, whereas the system having nonminimum phase zeros
(i.e., having unstable zero dynamics) will require feed-forward
passiﬁcation. Some systems may require a combination of the
basic passiﬁcation methods. For SISO systems, the passiﬁca-
tion process is easier than for MIMO systems. The reason is
that for SISO systems, only the phase plot needs to be checked
to determine passivity, whereas in the case of MIMO systems,
the KYP lemma conditions have to be checked. One numerical
technique that can be used to check the KYP lemma is linear
matrix inequality (LMI)-based PR conditions. The solution of
the LMI can be done using the LMI tool box in MATLAB or
another semideﬁnite programming package.
