Consider a signal sampled at equally spaced instants. The
time separation between two adjacent samples is called sam-
pling period (T), and its inverse is the sampling rate or
sampling frequency (fs). Because signal values are retained
only at sampling instants, the signal information can be cap-
tured in the product of the continuous-time signal with a
train, s(t ), of impulses spaced apart by T :
