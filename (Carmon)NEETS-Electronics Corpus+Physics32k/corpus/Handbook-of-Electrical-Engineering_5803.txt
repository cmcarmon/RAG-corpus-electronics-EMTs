Phase Shift in Y–D Connections
The positive and negative sequence networks presented in Fig. 64.7 are misleading in one important detail. For
Y–Y  or D–D  connections,  it  is  always  possible  to  label  the  phases  in  such  a  way  that  there  is  no  phase  shift
between corresponding primary and secondary quantities. However, for Y–D or D–Y connections, it is impos-
sible to label the phases in such a way that no phase shift between corresponding quantities is introduced. ANSI
standard C57.12.10.17.3.2 is as follows:
