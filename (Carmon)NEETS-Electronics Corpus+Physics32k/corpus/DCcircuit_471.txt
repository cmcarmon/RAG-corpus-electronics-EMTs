Please note something very important here. The total circuit resistance is only 625 Ω:
less than any one of the individual resistors. In the series circuit, where the total resistance
was the sum of the individual resistances, the total was bound to be greater than any one of the
resistors individually. Here in the parallel circuit, however, the opposite is true: we say that the
individual resistances diminish rather than add to make the total. This principle completes
our triad of ”rules” for parallel circuits, just as series circuits were found to have three rules
for voltage, current, and resistance. Mathematically, the relationship between total resistance
and individual resistances in a parallel circuit looks like this:
