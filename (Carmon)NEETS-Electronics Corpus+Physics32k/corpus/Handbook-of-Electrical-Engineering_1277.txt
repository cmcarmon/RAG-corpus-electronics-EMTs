Sinusoidal Signal Identiﬁcation
In  a  surprisingly  large  number  of  important  signal  processing  applications,  the  primary  objective  is  that  of
identifying sinusoidal components in noise-corrupted data. For example, multiple plane waves incident on an
equispaced linear array produce complex sinusoidal steering vectors. To identify sinusoidal signals in data, a
widely employed procedure is to ﬁrst form the data matrix whose upper and lower halves correspond to the
forward and backward prediction equations associated with the data, respectively. If the data under analysis is
speciﬁed by x(1), x(2), . . ., x(N), the associated forward-backward data matrix then takes the form
