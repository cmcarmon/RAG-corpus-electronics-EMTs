In 1851, George Gabriel Stokes derived an expression, now known as Stokes's law, for the frictional force – also called drag force – exerted on spherical objects with very small Reynolds numbers in a viscous fluid. Stokes's law is derived by solving the Stokes flow limit for small Reynolds numbers of the Navier–Stokes equations.
