e(t)  are  the  respective  angles  of  the  qr  and  qe  axes  of  the  rotor  and  synchronously
rotating reference frames measured with respect to the stationary axis of the a-phase stator winding. Note that
Î´ is the angle between the qr axis of the rotor and the qe axis of the reference synchronously rotating frame.
For multi-machine systems, the rotor angles of the machines could all be referred to a common synchronously
rotating reference frame at some bus or to the qr axis of the rotor of a chosen reference machine.
