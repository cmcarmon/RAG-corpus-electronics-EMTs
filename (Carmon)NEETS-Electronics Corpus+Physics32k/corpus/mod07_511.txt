Again refer to the schematic shown in figure 4-33 and consider how the voltage regulator operates to 
compensate for changes in input voltages. You know, of course, that the input voltage may vary and that 
any variation must be compensated for by the regulating device. If an increase in input voltage occurs, the 
resistance of R V automatically decreases to maintain the correct voltage division between RV and RS. You 
should see, therefore, that the regulator operates in the opposite way to compensate for a decrease in input 
voltage.
