We have noticed  that  series-parallel combination and  wye-delta trans-
formation help simplify circuits. Source transformation is another tool
for  simplifying  circuits.  Basic  to  these  tools  is  the  concept  of  equiva-
lence. We  recall that an equivalent circuit is one  whose v-i character-
istics are identical with the original circuit.
