Among the many types of seismic waves, one can make a broad distinction between body waves, which travel through the Earth, and surface waves, which travel at the Earth's surface.
Other modes of wave propagation exist than those described in this article; though of comparatively minor importance for earth-borne waves, they are important in the case of asteroseismology.
Body waves travel through the interior of the Earth.
Surface waves travel across the surface. Surface waves decay more slowly with distance than body waves, which travel in three dimensions.
Particle motion of surface waves is larger than that of body waves, so surface waves tend to cause more damage.
