This process is known as Reynolds decomposition. Temperature can be expressed as:




T
=


T
¯


+

T
′



{\displaystyle T={\overline {T}}+T'}
,
where






T
¯




{\displaystyle \ {\overline {T}}}
, is the slowly varying component and





T
′



{\displaystyle \ T'}
is the fluctuating component.
In the above picture,





T
′



{\displaystyle \ T'}
can be expressed in terms of the mixing length:






T

=

.


{\displaystyle \ T'=-\xi '{\frac {\partial {\overline {T}}}{\partial z}}.}

The fluctuating components of velocity,





u
′



{\displaystyle \ u'}
,





v
′



{\displaystyle \ v'}
, and





w
′



{\displaystyle \ w'}
, can also be expressed in a similar fashion:






u

=

ξ

u

v

w

.


{\displaystyle \ u'=-\xi '{\frac {\partial {\overline {u}}}{\partial z}},\qquad \ v'=-\xi '{\frac {\partial {\overline {v}}}{\partial z}},\qquad \ w'=-\xi '{\frac {\partial {\overline {w}}}{\partial z}}.}

although the theoretical justification for doing so is weaker, as the pressure gradient force can significantly alter the fluctuating components. Moreover, for the case of vertical velocity,





w
′



{\displaystyle \ w'}
must be in a neutrally stratified fluid.
Taking the product of horizontal and vertical fluctuations gives us:

{\displaystyle \ {\overline {u'w'}}={\overline {\xi '^{2}}}\left|{\frac {\partial {\overline {w}}}{\partial z}}\right|{\frac {\partial {\overline {u}}}{\partial z}}}
.
The eddy viscosity is defined from the equation above as:

{\displaystyle \ K_{m}={\overline {\xi '^{2}}}\left|{\frac {\partial {\overline {w}}}{\partial z}}\right|}
