In addition to representing numbers and letters, bits can be used also to 
carry information. As information carriers, data bits are versatile. They can 
represent many two‐state (binary) things: a screen’s pixel is either on or off; 
a CTRL key is either up or down; a laser pit is either present or absent on a 
DVD surface; an ATM transaction is either authorized or not; and much more. 
By assigning logical values of 1 and 0 to a particular on/off choice, you can 
use bits to carry information about physical events — and allow that informa-
tion to control other things by processing the bits in a digital circuit.
