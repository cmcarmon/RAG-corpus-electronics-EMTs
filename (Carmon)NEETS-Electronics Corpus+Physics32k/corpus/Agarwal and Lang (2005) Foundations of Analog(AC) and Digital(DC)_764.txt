It turns out
that certain types of gates take up less room or are easier to build in certain technologies
than other types of gates. We can make use of the equivalence rules to convert a circuit
from one form to another. Let us derive an implementation of the AND function based
on two-input NOR gates. In other words, we wish to transform the expression Z =
A Â· B into one that uses only NOR operators. The following steps show how we can
transform the AND expression into one that uses three NOR operations:
