For a machine using field coils, which is most large generators, the field current must be supplied, otherwise the generator will be useless. Thus it is important to have a reliable supply. Although the output of a generator can be used once it starts up, it is also critical to be able to start the generators reliably. In any case, it is important to be able to control the field since this will maintain the system voltage.
