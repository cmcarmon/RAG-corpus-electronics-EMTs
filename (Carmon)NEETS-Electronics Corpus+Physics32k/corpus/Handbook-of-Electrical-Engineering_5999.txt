where ω
b = 2πfrated electrical radian per second, frated being the rated frequency in Hertz of the machine. When
dealing with complex waveforms, it is logical to use peak rather than the rms value as the base value. The base
quantities with peak rather rms value of a P-pole, three-phase induction machines with rated line-to-line rms
voltage, Vrated, and rated volt-ampere, Srated, area as follows:
