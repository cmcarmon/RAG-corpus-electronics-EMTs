Capacitors  and  batteries  both  store  electri-
cal  energy,  but  in  different  ways.  A  battery 
uses  electrochemical  reactions  to  produce 
charged  particles,  which  build  up  on  its  two 
metal terminals, creating a voltage. A capaci-
tor  doesnâ€™t  produce  charged  particles,  but  it 
does  allow  charged  particles  to  build  up  on
