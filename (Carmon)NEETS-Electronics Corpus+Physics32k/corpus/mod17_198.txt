HETERODYNING.â€”As you know the intermediate frequency is developed by a process called
heterodyning. This action takes place in the mixer stage (sometimes called a converter or first detector).
Heterodyning is the combining of the incoming signal with the local oscillator signal. When heterodyning
the incoming signal and the local oscillator signal in the mixer stage, four frequencies are produced. They
are the two basic input frequencies and the sum and the difference of those two frequencies. The amplifier
that follows (IF amplifier) will be tuned to the difference frequency. This difference frequency is known
as the intermediate frequency (IF). A typical value of IF for an AM communications receiver is 455
kilohertz. The difference frequency is a lower frequency than either the rf input or oscillator frequencies.
This lower frequency gives slightly better gain but does increase the chances of image frequency
interference. Image frequencies will be discussed later in this chapter.
