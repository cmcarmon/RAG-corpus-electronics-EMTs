A microcontroller is a single-chip computer. It con-
tains limited memory, I/O interfacing, and a central 
processing unit (CPU) on the chip (Figure 46-7). This 
makes it ideal for monitoring and controlling func-
tions. Because it is on a chip, the microcontroller and 
its support circuits are often built into the device they 
control.
