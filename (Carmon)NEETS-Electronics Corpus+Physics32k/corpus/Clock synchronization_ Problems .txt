As a result of the difficulties managing time at smaller scale, there are problems associated with clock skew that take on more complexity in a distributed system in which several computers will need to realize the same global time.
For instance, in Unix systems the make command is used to compile new or modified code without the need to recompile unchanged code. The make command uses the clock of the machine it runs on to determine which source files need to be recompiled. If the sources reside on a separate file server and the two machines have unsynchronized clocks, the make program might not produce the correct results.
