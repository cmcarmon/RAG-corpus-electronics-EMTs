If x is the variable being plotted using a log scale, x is multiplied by a fixed
factor for each fixed length increment along the axis. In contrast, on a
linear scale, x is incremented by a fixed amount for each fixed length
increment along the axis. For example, equal length increments along the
frequency axis on a linear scale might correspond to the values 0, 2 × 106,
4 × 106, 6 × 106, 8 × 106, and so on. On the other hand, equal length
