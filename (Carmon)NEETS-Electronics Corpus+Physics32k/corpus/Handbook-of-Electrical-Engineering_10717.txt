A worldwide network of SARSAT-COSPAS stations monitors signals from satellite-based transponders lis-
tening on 121.5, 243, and 406 MHz, the three international distress frequencies. Software at the listening stations
calculates  the  position  of  Emergency  Location  Transmitters  within  20  kilometers,  based  on  the  observed
Doppler-shift  history,  so  that  rescue  vehicles  can  be  dispatched.  Thousands  of  lives  have  been  saved  world-
wide, from arctic bush-pilots to tropical Ô¨Åshermen.
