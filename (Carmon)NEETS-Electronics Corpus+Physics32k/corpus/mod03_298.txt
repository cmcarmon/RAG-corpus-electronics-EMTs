A fuse is the simplest circuit protection device. It derives its name from the Latin word "fusus,"
meaning "to melt." Fuses have been used almost from the beginning of the use of electricity. The earliest
type of fuse was simply a bare wire between two connections. The wire was smaller than the conductor it
was protecting and, therefore, would melt before the conductor it was protecting was harmed. Some
"copper fuse link" types are still in use, but most fuses no longer use copper as the fuse element (the part
of the fuse that melts). After changing from copper to other metals, tubes or enclosures were developed to
hold the melting metal. The enclosed fuse made possible the addition of filler material, which helps to
contain the arc that occurs when the element melts.
