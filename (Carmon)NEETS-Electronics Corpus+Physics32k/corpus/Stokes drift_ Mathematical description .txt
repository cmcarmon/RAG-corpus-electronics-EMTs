The Lagrangian motion of a fluid parcel with position vector x = ξ(α,t) in the Eulerian coordinates is given by:

)
,


{\displaystyle {\dot {\boldsymbol {\xi }}}\,=\,{\frac {\partial {\boldsymbol {\xi }}}{\partial t}}\,=\,{\boldsymbol {u}}({\boldsymbol {\xi }},t),}

where ∂ξ / ∂t is the partial derivative of ξ(α,t) with respect to t, and
ξ(α,t) is the Lagrangian position vector of a fluid parcel, in meters,
u(x,t) is the Eulerian velocity, in meters per second,
x is the position vector in the Eulerian coordinate system, in meters,
α is the position vector in the Lagrangian coordinate system, in meters,
t is the time, in seconds.
Often, the Lagrangian coordinates α are chosen to coincide with the Eulerian coordinates x at the initial time t = t0 :

{\displaystyle {\boldsymbol {\xi }}({\boldsymbol {\alpha }},t_{0})\,=\,{\boldsymbol {\alpha }}.}

But also other ways of labeling the fluid parcels are possible.
If the average value of a quantity is denoted by an overbar, then the average Eulerian velocity vector ūE and average Lagrangian velocity vector ūL are:

Different definitions of the average may be used, depending on the subject of study, see ergodic theory:
time average,
space average,
ensemble average and
phase average.

In many situations, the mapping of average quantities from some Eulerian position x to a corresponding Lagrangian position α forms a problem. Since a fluid parcel with label α traverses along a path of many different Eulerian positions x, it is not possible to assign α to a unique x. A mathematically sound basis for an unambiguous mapping between average Lagrangian and Eulerian quantities is provided by the theory of the Generalized Lagrangian Mean (GLM) by Andrews and McIntyre (1978).
