Two-Terminal Devices
While microwave and millimeter-wave transistor technology
has matured considerably in last decade, many applications
still rely on two-terminal devices for a number of reasons,
including frequency limitations of transistors and noise or
niche applications, such as P-i-N diodes in switching circuitry.
Microwave and millimeter-wave diodes are still commonly
used in oscillators and mixer circuitry. Two of the most com-
monly used two-terminal devices at these frequencies are the
transferred electron device (TED), which relies on the Gunn
effect, and the impact ionization transit-time (IMPATT)
diode. Both of these devices may be used in reﬂection-type
oscillators and ampliﬁers. Schottky diodes are used well into
the millimeter-wave region and beyond.
