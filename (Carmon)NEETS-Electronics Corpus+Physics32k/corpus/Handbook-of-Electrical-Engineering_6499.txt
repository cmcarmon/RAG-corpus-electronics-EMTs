Intensity Modulation
As mentioned in the introduction, the light output from the laser should be linearly proportional to the injected
. Many video channels are combined electron-
current. The laser is prebiased to an average output intensity

ically, and the total RF signal is added directly to the laser current. The optical modulation depth (
 is
as the ratio of the peak modulation 
typically near 4%.
