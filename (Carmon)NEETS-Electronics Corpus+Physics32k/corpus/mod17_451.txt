An rf burn hazard is a hazardous condition caused by the existence of radio frequency (rf) voltages in 
places where they are not intended to be. Any ship with high-power hf transmitters is susceptible. 
Potentially hazardous voltages have been found in many areas. Some of these areas are lifelines, vertical 
ladders, ASROC launchers, gun mounts, rigging for underway replenishment, and boat davits. Another of 
these areas is on aircraft tied down on carrier and helicopter flight decks.
