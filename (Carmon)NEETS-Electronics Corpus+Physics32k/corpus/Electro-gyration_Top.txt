The electrogyration effect is the spatial dispersion phenomenon, that consists in the change of optical activity (gyration) of crystals by a constant or time-varying electric field. Being a spatial dispersion effect, the induced optical activity exhibit different behavior under the operation of wave vector reversal, when compared with the Faraday effect: the optical activity increment associated with the electrogyration effect changes its sign under that operation, contrary to the Faraday effect. Formally, it is a special case of gyroelectromagnetism obtained when the magnetic permeability tensor is diagonal.
The electrogyration effect linear in the electric field occurs in crystals of all point groups of symmetry except for the three cubic – m3m, 432 and

. The effect proportional to the square of the electric field can exist only in crystals belonging to acentric point groups of symmetry.
