Three central paradigms in the construction of signature schemes are the “refreshing” of the “effective” signing-
key, the usage of an “authentication tree,” and the “hashing paradigm.” The ﬁrst paradigm is aimed at limiting
the potential dangers of a chosen message attack by signing the given message using a newly generated (random)
instance of the signature scheme, and authenticating this random instance relative to the ﬁxed public key. A
natural way of carrying on the authentication of the many newly generated keys is by using an authentication
tree [Merkle, 1980]. Finally, the hashing paradigm refers to the common practice of signing real documents
