The above results can be derived perhaps more simply in polar coordinates, and at the same time extended to general motion within a plane, as shown next. Polar coordinates in the plane employ a radial unit vector uρ and an angular unit vector uθ, as shown above. A particle at position r is described by:





r

=
ρ


u


ρ



,


{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} =\rho \mathbf {u} _{\rho }\ ,}

where the notation ρ is used to describe the distance of the path from the origin instead of R to emphasize that this distance is not fixed, but varies with time. The unit vector uρ travels with the particle and always points in the same direction as r(t). Unit vector uθ also travels with the particle and stays orthogonal to uρ. Thus, uρ and uθ form a local Cartesian coordinate system attached to the particle, and tied to the path traveled by the particle. By moving the unit vectors so their tails coincide, as seen in the circle at the left of the image above, it is seen that uρ and uθ form a right-angled pair with tips on the unit circle that trace back and forth on the perimeter of this circle with the same angle θ(t) as r(t).
When the particle moves, its velocity is

{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} ={\frac {\mathrm {d} \rho }{\mathrm {d} t}}\mathbf {u} _{\rho }+\rho {\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {u} _{\rho }}{\mathrm {d} t}}\ .}

To evaluate the velocity, the derivative of the unit vector uρ is needed. Because uρ is a unit vector, its magnitude is fixed, and it can change only in direction, that is, its change duρ has a component only perpendicular to uρ. When the trajectory r(t) rotates an amount dθ, uρ, which points in the same direction as r(t), also rotates by dθ. See image above. Therefore, the change in uρ is

.


{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {u} _{\rho }}{\mathrm {d} t}}=\mathbf {u} _{\theta }{\frac {\mathrm {d} \theta }{\mathrm {d} t}}\ .}

In a similar fashion, the rate of change of uθ is found. As with uρ, uθ is a unit vector and can only rotate without changing size. To remain orthogonal to uρ while the trajectory r(t) rotates an amount dθ, uθ, which is orthogonal to r(t), also rotates by dθ. See image above. Therefore, the change duθ is orthogonal to uθ and proportional to dθ (see image above):

.


{\displaystyle {\frac {\mathrm {d} \mathbf {u} _{\theta }}{\mathrm {d} t}}=-{\frac {\mathrm {d} \theta }{\mathrm {d} t}}\mathbf {u} _{\rho }\ .}

The image above shows the sign to be negative: to maintain orthogonality, if duρ is positive with dθ, then duθ must decrease.

These results agree with those above for nonuniform circular motion. See also the article on non-uniform circular motion. If this acceleration is multiplied by the particle mass, the leading term is the centripetal force and the negative of the second term related to angular acceleration is sometimes called the Euler force.
For trajectories other than circular motion, for example, the more general trajectory envisioned in the image above, the instantaneous center of rotation and radius of curvature of the trajectory are related only indirectly to the coordinate system defined by uρ and uθ and to the length |r(t)| = ρ. Consequently, in the general case, it is not straightforward to disentangle the centripetal and Euler terms from the above general acceleration equation.  To deal directly with this issue, local coordinates are preferable, as discussed next.
