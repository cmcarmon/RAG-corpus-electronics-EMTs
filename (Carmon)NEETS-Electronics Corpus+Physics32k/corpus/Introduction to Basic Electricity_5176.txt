With axial lead components, the leads have to be 
bent at a right angle. Grasp the ends of the compo-
nent between the thumb and index finger, and pull the 
body outward while maintaining a grip on the ends of 
the leads (Figure 49-14). The component should now 
fit between the pad mounting holes. Position compo-
nents so the values can be easily read. Arrange resis-
tors so the value can be read top to bottom or left to 
right. Observe polarity of all polarized components, 
and orientate them properly on the printed circuit
