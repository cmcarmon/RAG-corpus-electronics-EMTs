A  VLSI  chip  can  today  contain  millions  of  transistors  and  is  expected  to  contain  more  than  100  million
transistors  in  the  year  2000.  One  of  the  main  factors  contributing  to  this  increase  is  the  effort  that  has  been
invested in the development of computer-aided design (CAD) systems for VLSI design. The VLSI CAD systems
are able to simplify the design process by hiding the low-level circuit theory and device physics details from the
designer, and allowing him or her to concentrate on the functionality of the design and on ways of optimizing it.
A  VLSI  CAD  system  supports  descriptions  of  hardware  at  many  levels  of  abstraction,  such  as  system,
subsystem, register, gate, circuit, and layout levels. It allows designers to design a hardware device at an abstract
level and progressively work down to the layout level. A layout is a complete geometric representation (a set
of rectangles) from which the latest fabrication technologies directly produce reliable, working chips. A VLSI
