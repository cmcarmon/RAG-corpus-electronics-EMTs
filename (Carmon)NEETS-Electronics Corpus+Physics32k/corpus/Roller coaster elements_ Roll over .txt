This element, known as a roll over on roller coaster built by Vekoma and known as a sea serpent roll on coasters built by B&M, is a roller coaster inversion featuring two vertical loop halves that are connected by two opposite-facing half corkscrews. The element is similar to a cobra roll, except the trains exit the track element facing the same direction as when they entered; the trains on a cobra roll exit in the opposite direction. The element is found on most Vekoma SLC roller coasters (suspended looping coasters) and on Medusa at Six Flags Discovery Kingdom.
