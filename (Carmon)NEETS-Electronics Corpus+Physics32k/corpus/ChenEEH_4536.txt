Another classical system problem encountered in design
analysis is that of determining the sensitivity of the input/
output relation S to variations in certain component values.
In this case, differentiation of the connection function f with
respect to the component parameters of interest is the major
constituent of the sensitivity analysis. SpeciÔ¨Åc applications of
the component connection model to sensitivity analysis are
contained in Ransom (1973, 1972), Ransom and Saeks (1975),
and DeCarlo (1983).
