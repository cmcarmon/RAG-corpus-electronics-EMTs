Practical Systems Using Parallel Sub-Systems
A  computer  system  that  uses  parallel  sub-systems  to  improve  reliability  must  incorporate  some  kind  of
arbitrator  to  determine  which  output  to  use  at  any  given  time.  A  common  method  of  arbitration  involves
adding a voter to a system with N parallel modules, where N is an odd number. For example, if N = 3, a single
incorrect  output  can  be  masked  by  the  two  correct  outputs  outvoting  it.  Hence,  the  system  output  will  be
correct, even though an error has occurred in one of the sub-systems. This system would be known as Triple-
Modular-Redundant (TMR) (Fig. 98.6).
