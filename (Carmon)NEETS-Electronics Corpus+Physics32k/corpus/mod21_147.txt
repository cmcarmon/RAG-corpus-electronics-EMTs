AUXILIARY TEST.â€”As mentioned previously, two special tests (cathode activity and sensitive
grid shorts) may be made by use of controls located in the auxiliary compartment (fig. 2-2). The cathode
activity test (CATH ACT) is used to indicate the amount of useful life remaining in the tube. By reducing
the filament voltage by 10 percent and allowing the cathode to cool off slightly, the ability of the cathode
as an emitter of electrons can be estimated. This test is made in conjunction with the normal quality test.
