The transportation industry has beneﬁted most from the
availability of MEMS to date. The impact of MEMS on
the analytical and medical industries has already been signiﬁ-
cant, and major growth in these arenas can be expected.
The promises of optical MEMS in the ﬁber communication
industry, and of RF MEMS in the wireless industry, have
yet to be realized. Their impact on these communication
modes, however, is only a matter of time and timing. Defense
industries will similarly see ever increasing utilization of MEMS.
The entire ﬁeld of MEMS has ‘‘turned the corner’’ in the
past decade from gradual growth to rapid exponential growth.
MEMS are not likely ever to be so important as integrated
circuits. However, they will be a part of the fabric of life in the
new century, embedded in many products owned by most
people in technological societies.
