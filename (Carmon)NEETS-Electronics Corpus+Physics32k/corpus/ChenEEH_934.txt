A natural way to solve the linear system described by equation
4.61 is by back substitution,15 such that l is initially computed,
followed by the computation of s. The Lagrange multipliers l
are determined from the equation (BBt )l ¼ 2Bg in the second
row of equation 4.61, where the right-hand side 2Bg is a
nonzero vector; that is, Bg 6¼ {0}. The opposite situation,
Bg ¼ {0}, is highly unlikely to occur since Bg ¼ {0} means
that g 2 ker(B), which in turn means (recall equation 4.35
through 4.38) that the objective clock schedule g is feasible
and no optimization needs to be performed.16
Therefore, the equation (BBt )l ¼ 2Bg in equation 4.61 can
have either no solutions or exactly one solution depending on
whether the matrix BBt is singular or not. In other words, the
nonsingularity of BBt is a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for
the existence of a unique solution ^sst ^llt
of equation 4.60. If
the product BBt
is denoted by M, note that the symmetric
