The frequency for which a crystal is ground is referred to as the NATURAL RESONANT 
FREQUENCY of the crystal. Voltage applied to the crystal produces mechanical vibrations which, in 
turn, produce an output voltage at the natural resonant frequency of the crystal. A vibrating crystal can be 
represented by an equivalent electrical circuit composed of capacitance, inductance, and resistance.
