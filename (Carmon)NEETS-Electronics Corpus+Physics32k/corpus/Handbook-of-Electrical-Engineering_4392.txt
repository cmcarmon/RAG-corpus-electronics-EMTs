Preform Fabrication
The ﬁrst step in the fabrication of optical ﬁber is the creation of a glass preform. A preform is a large blank of
glass several millimeters in diameter and several centimeters in length. The preform has all the desired properties
(e.g.,  geometrical  ratios  and  chemical  composition)  necessary  to  yield  a  high-quality  ﬁber.  The  preform  is
subsequently drawn into a multi-kilometer-long hair-thin ﬁber. Four different preform manufacturing processes
are currently in commercial use.
