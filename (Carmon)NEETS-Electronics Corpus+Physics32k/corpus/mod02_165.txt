In order to better understand the action of a capacitor in conjunction with other components, the charge
and discharge actions of a purely capacitive circuit are analyzed first. For ease of explanation the capacitor
and voltage source shown in figure 3-6 are assumed to be perfect (no internal resistance), although this is
impossible in practice.
