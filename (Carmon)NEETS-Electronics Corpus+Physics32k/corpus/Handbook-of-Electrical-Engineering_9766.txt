The rover control system features operator designation of targets and autonomous control to reach targets and
perform tasks. The instructions will be sent to the rover from a controller on earth. The onboard control system
is built around an Intel 80C85 processor, which is an 8-bit processor and runs at about 100,000 instructions per
second.
