The control unit decodes each instruction that 
enters the computer. It then generates the  necessary 
pulses to carry out the functions specified. If, for ex-
ample, an instruction requires two numbers to be 
added together, the control unit sends pulses to the 
ALU to perform the addition. If the  instruction re-
quires a word to be stored in memory, control sends 
the necessary pulses to memory to store the data.
