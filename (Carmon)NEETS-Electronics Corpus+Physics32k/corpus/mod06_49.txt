Let's analyze the circuit in figure 1-2. You probably already have a good idea of how the circuit
works. The heated filament causes electrons to boil from its surface. The battery in the filament-plate
circuit places a POSITIVE charge on the plate (because the plate is connected to the positive side of the
battery). The electrons (negative charge) that boil from the filament are attracted to the positively charged
plate. They continue through the ammeter, the battery, and back to the filament. You can see that electron
flow across the space between filament and plate is actually an application of a basic law you already
knowâ€”UNLIKE CHARGES ATTRACT.
