Ideally the ratio of partial pressures equals the ratio of the number of molecules. That is, the mole fraction of an individual gas component in an ideal gas mixture can be expressed in terms of the component's partial pressure or the moles of the component:





x


i



=



p


i



p


=



n


i



n




{\displaystyle x_{\mathrm {i} }={\frac {p_{\mathrm {i} }}{p}}={\frac {n_{\mathrm {i} }}{n}}}

and the partial pressure of an individual gas component in an ideal gas can be obtained using this expression:





p


i



=

x


i



â‹…
p


{\displaystyle p_{\mathrm {i} }=x_{\mathrm {i} }\cdot p}

The mole fraction of a gas component in a gas mixture is equal to the volumetric fraction of that component in a gas mixture.
