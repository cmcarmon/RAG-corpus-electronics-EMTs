An RHCP plane wave at a frequency of 1.0 GHz is incident on
the surface of the ocean at an angle of u ¼ 308. Determine the
percentage of power that is reﬂected from the ocean, and
characterize the polarization of the reﬂected wave (axial ratio,
tilt angle, and handedness). In addition, determine the ﬁeld of
the inhomogeneous transmitted plane wave. The parameters of
the ocean water are assumed to be e0 ¼ 78 (ignoring polariza-
tion loss) and s ¼ 4 S/m.
