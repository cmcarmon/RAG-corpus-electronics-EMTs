The system response is determined by the principle of superposition, and the phasor technique
yields the steady-state response. Each frequency component of the response is produced by
the corresponding harmonic of the excitation. The sum of these responses becomes the Fourier
series of the system response. Note that while the phasor method is employed to determine each
frequency component, the individual time functions must be used in forming the series for the
system response. Such a method of analysis is applicable to all linear systems.
