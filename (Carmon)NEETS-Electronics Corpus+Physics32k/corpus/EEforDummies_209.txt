▶✓ LED2 current (I2 ): Remove the multimeter and reconnect LED1. Then 
disconnect the positive lead of LED2 from the resistor. Insert the multi-
meter into the circuit in series with LED2, as shown in the photo on the 
right in Figure 4-6. (Note that I removed the lower orange jumper to dis-
connect LED2 from the resistor, and then inserted my multimeter at that 
opening in the circuit.) You’re measuring the current that flows through 
the LED2, or I2 (refer to Figure 4-3).
