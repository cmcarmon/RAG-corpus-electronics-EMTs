5. The percentage of reserves unexhausted in the reactive reserve basin is theoretically justiﬁed as a proximity
measure for clogging instability in any clogging voltage instability agent. The percentage of voltage control
areas in a reactive reserve basin with unexhausted reactive reserve is theoretically justiﬁed as a proximity
measure for each loss of control voltage instability agent [Schlueter, 1998b; f].
