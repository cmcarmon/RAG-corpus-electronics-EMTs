The switching speed of these devices is limited by the time it takes the photogenerated carriers to diffuse
into  the  light-emitting  region.  Optical  turn-off  times  are  also  limited  by  the  RC  time  constant.  For  devices
made  so  far,  the  RC  time  constants  are  in  the  range  of  1â€“10  ns,  and  optical  switch-on  times  were  ~10  ns.
Performance of the devices is expected to improve as the areas are reduced; switching times comparable to the
best electronic devices (~10 ps) are possible, although the optical turn-on times of at least the surface-emitting
LED  devices  will  continue  to  be  slower  since  this  time  is  determined  by  diffusion  effects  and  not  device
capacitance and resistance. Lasing devices should offer improved optical turn-on times.
