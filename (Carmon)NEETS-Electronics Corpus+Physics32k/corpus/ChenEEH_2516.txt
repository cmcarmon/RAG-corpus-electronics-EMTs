The purpose of an impedance transformer is to transform a
given impedance to a speciﬁc value. An impedance matching
network may consist of more than one impedance transformer.
Its main goal is to match a given impedance to a prescribed value
over a frequency range of interest to ensure maximum power
transfer from a source to a load. Typical applications include
returning loss optimization between an antenna and low-noise
ampliﬁer, achieving low-noise characteristics in active circuits,
and providing conjugate complex matching in ampliﬁer design.
Electrical and/or mechanical impedance tuners are widely used
in RF and microwave measurement setups, such as load-pull
nonlinear characterization systems. Impedance transformers
and matching networks are perhaps the most important and
most widely used passive microwave circuit component.
