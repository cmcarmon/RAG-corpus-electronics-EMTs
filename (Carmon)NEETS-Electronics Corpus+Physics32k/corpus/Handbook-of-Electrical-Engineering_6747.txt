A time-slotted bus maintains on the bus a continuous stream of short, ﬁxed-length frames that are initially
empty but can be ﬁlled with data as they pass stations with waiting packets. The distributed queue, dual bus
(DQDB) local- and metropolitan-area network uses two-directional buses so that a station can reserve on its
downstream bus a frame for its upstream-destined packets.
