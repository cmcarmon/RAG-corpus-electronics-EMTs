YAGI ANTENNAS.â€”An example of a multielement parasitic array is the YAGI ANTENNA 
(figure 4-32, views A and B). The spacings between the elements are not uniform. The radiation from the 
different elements arrives in phase in the forward direction, but out of phase by various amounts in the 
other directions.
