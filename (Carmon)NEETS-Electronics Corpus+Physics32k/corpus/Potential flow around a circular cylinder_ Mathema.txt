A cylinder (or disk) of radius R is placed in a two-dimensional, incompressible, inviscid flow. The goal is to find the steady velocity vector V and pressure p in a plane, subject to the condition that far from the cylinder the velocity vector (relative to unit vectors i and j) is





V

=
U

i

+
0

j


,


{\displaystyle \mathbf {V} =U\mathbf {i} +0\mathbf {j} \,,}

where U is a constant, and at the boundary of the cylinder





V

,


{\displaystyle \mathbf {V} \cdot \mathbf {\hat {n}} =0\,,}

where n̂ is the vector normal to the cylinder surface. The upstream flow is uniform and has no vorticity. The flow is inviscid, incompressible and has constant mass density ρ. The flow therefore remains without vorticity, or is said to be irrotational, with ∇ × V = 0 everywhere. Being irrotational, there must exist a velocity potential φ:





V

=
∇
ϕ

.


{\displaystyle \mathbf {V} =\nabla \phi \,.}

Being incompressible, ∇ · V = 0, so φ must satisfy Laplace's equation:

ϕ

.


{\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}\phi =0\,.}

The solution for φ is obtained most easily in polar coordinates r and θ, related to conventional Cartesian coordinates by x = r cos θ and y = r sin θ. In polar coordinates, Laplace's equation is (see Del in cylindrical and spherical coordinates):

Being invisicid and irrotational, Bernoulli's equation allows the solution for pressure field to be obtained directly from the velocity field:

{\displaystyle p={\tfrac {1}{2}}\rho \left(U^{2}-V^{2}\right)+p_{\infty },}

where the constants U and p∞ appear so that p → p∞ far from the cylinder, where V = U. Using V2 = V2r + V2θ,

On the surface of the cylinder, or r = R, pressure varies from a maximum of 1 (shown in the diagram in red) at the stagnation points at θ = 0 and θ = π to a minimum of −3 (shown in blue) on the sides of the cylinder, at θ = π/2 and θ = 3π/2. Likewise, V varies from V = 0 at the stagnation points to V = 2U on the sides, in the low pressure.
