Another  very 
significant  difference  between 
analogue  and  digital  instruments  is  the  input 
resistance  that  they  present  to  the  circuit  under 
investigation  when  taking  voltage  measurements. 
The  resistance  of  a  reasonable  quality  analogue 
multi-range  meter  can  be  as  low  as  50  kG
on  the 
2.5 V. With a digital instrument, on the other hand, 
the input resistance is typically 10 MG
on the 2 V 
range. The digital instrument is thus to be preferred 
when  accurate  readings  are  to  be  taken.  This  is 
particularly  important  when  measurements  are  to 
be made on high impedance circuits, as illustrated 
by the following: 
  Two multi-range meters are used to measure the 
voltage  produced  by  the  two  potential  dividers
