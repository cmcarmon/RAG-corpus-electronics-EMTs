Contrast: For a cathode ray tube, contrast is the evaluation of the visibility of the picture presented on the
phosphor screen in a given ambient lighting. Contrast is usually measured by the contrast ratio, which
is the ratio of the luminance of the picture element under evaluation to the background luminance.
