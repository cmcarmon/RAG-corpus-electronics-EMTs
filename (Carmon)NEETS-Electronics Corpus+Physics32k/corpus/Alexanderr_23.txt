Current and voltage are the two basic variables in electric circuits.
The common term signal is used for an electric quantity such as a cur-
rent  or  a  voltage  (or  even  electromagnetic  wave)  when  it  is  used  for
conveying information. Engineers prefer to call such variables signals
rather than mathematical functions of time because of their importance
in  communications  and  other  disciplines.  Like  electric  current,  a  con-
stant voltage is called a dc voltage and is represented by V, whereas a
sinusoidally time-varying voltage is called an ac voltage and is repre-
sented by v. A dc voltage is commonly produced by a battery; ac volt-
age is produced by an electric generator.
