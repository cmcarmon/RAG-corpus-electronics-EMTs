FIELDâ€”One or more related characters that are treated as a unit of information. A field (also 
referred to as a data item) may be alphabetic, numeric, or alphanumeric, and may be either fixed or 
variable in length. For example, your social security number (SSN) is of a fixed length; that is, it's always 
9 positions in length. Whereas, names are variable length because they may be from 2 to 25 positions in 
length.
