Since the plates of the capacitor are changing polarity at the same rate as the ac voltage, the capacitor 
seems to pass an alternating current. Actually, the electrons do not pass through the dielectric, but their 
rushing back and forth from plate to plate causes a current flow in the circuit. It is convenient, however, to 
say that the alternating current flows "through" the capacitor. You know this is not true, but the 
expression avoids a lot of trouble when speaking of current flow in a circuit containing a capacitor. By the 
same short cut, you may say that the capacitor does not pass a direct current (if both plates are connected 
to a dc source, current will flow only long enough to charge the capacitor). With a capacitor type of 
hookup in a circuit containing both ac and dc, only the ac will be "passed" on to another circuit.
