An intermediate energy projectile transfers energy or picks up or loses nucleons to the nucleus in a single quick (10âˆ’21 second) event. Energy and momentum transfer are relatively small. These are particularly useful in experimental nuclear physics, because the reaction mechanisms are often simple enough to calculate with sufficient accuracy to probe the structure of the target nucleus.
