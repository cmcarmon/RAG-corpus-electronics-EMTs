Basic Operational Concepts
To perform a given computational task, an appropriate program consisting of a set of machine instructions is
stored  in  the  main  memory.  Individual  instructions  are  brought  from  the  memory  into  the  processor  for
execution. Data used as operands are also stored in the memory. A typical instruction may be
