Processing for the X-37 is done inside Bays 1 and 2 of the Orbiter Processing Facility at Kennedy Space Center in Florida where the vehicle is loaded with its top secret payload. The X-37 is then placed inside a fairing along with its stage adapter and loaded on a KAMAG transporter for delivery to the launch site, be it Cape Canaveral SLC-37, SLC-41, or Kennedy Space Center LC-39A.
Landing is done at one of three sites across the country: the Shuttle Landing Facility at Kennedy Space Center, Vandenberg Air Force Base, or Edwards Air Force Base. To return to Kennedy Space Center, the X-37 is placed into a payload canister and loaded into a Boeing C-17 cargo plane. Once at Kennedy the X-37 is unloaded and towed to the OPF where it is prepared for its next flight, similar to the Space Shuttle.
