Generally speaking, there are two schools of thoughts in statis-
tics: Bayes and Fisher. Bayesian statistics and estimation were
presented in the previous section, where the emphasis was on
estimation of random signals and parameters. This section is
focused on estimation of a deterministic parameter (or signal).
A natural question that one may ask is if the Bayesian approach
presented in the previous section is applicable here or if the
estimation of deterministic signals can be treated as a special
case of estimating random signals. A closer examination shows
that an alternative approach needs to be taken (van Trees,
1968) because the essential issues that govern the performance
of estimators differ signiÔ¨Åcantly.
