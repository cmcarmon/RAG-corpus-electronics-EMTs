HN series connectors have a 50-ohm impedance and threaded coupling connectors designed for 
high-voltage applications. These connectors are weatherproof. The frequency range is 0-4 gigahertz. The 
HN series is used with medium size coaxial cable such as RG-8/U, RG-9/U, RG-87/U, RG-213/U, RG-
214/U, and RG-225/U. Figure 1-27 shows three typical HN connectors. Figure 1-28 shows how HN 
connectors are attached to coaxial cable. Table 1-15 indicates which HN connector to use with what 
coaxial cable type.
