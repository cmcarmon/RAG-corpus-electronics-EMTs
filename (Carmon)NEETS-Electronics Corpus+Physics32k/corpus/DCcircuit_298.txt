The conditions necessary to produce 1,000 Ω of body resistance don’t have to be as extreme
as what was presented, either (sweaty skin with contact made on a gold ring). Body resis-
tance may decrease with the application of voltage (especially if tetanus causes the victim to
maintain a tighter grip on a conductor) so that with constant voltage a shock may increase in
severity after initial contact. What begins as a mild shock – just enough to ”freeze” a victim
so they can’t let go – may escalate into something severe enough to kill them as their body
resistance decreases and current correspondingly increases.
