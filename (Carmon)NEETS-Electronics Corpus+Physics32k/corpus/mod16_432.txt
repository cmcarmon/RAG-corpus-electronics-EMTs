During troubleshooting, you will often be required to measure voltage, current, and resistance.
Rather than using three or more separate meters for these measurements, you can use the
MULTIMETER. The multimeter contains circuitry that allows it to be used as a voltmeter, an ammeter,
or an ohmmeter. A multimeter is often called a VOLT-OHM-MILLIAMMETER (VOM).
