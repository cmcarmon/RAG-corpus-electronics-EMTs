A SYSTEM is a combination of sets, units, assemblies, subassemblies, and parts joined together to 
perform a specific operational function or several functions. Examples are communications systems, radar 
systems, or navigation systems. You will find the majority of troubleshooting done in the Navy is system 
oriented. Figure 1-2 is a pictorial view of a typical communications system containing the components 
necessary for transmission and reception of voice, telegraphy, and teletypewriter signals. Figure 1-3 is a 
block diagram of the same communications system with the arrows showing the direction of signal flow.
