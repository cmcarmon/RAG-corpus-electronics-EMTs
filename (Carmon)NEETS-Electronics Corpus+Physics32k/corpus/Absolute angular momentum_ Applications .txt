In the shallow troposphere of the earth, one can approximate r≈a, the distance between the fluid parcel and the center of the earth approximately equal to the mean Earth radius:

{\displaystyle M\approx ua\cos(\varphi )+\Omega a^{2}\cos ^{2}(\varphi )}

where
a represents Earth radius (in m, usually 6.371009 Mm)
M represents absolute angular momentum per unit mass of the fluid parcel (in m2/s),
u represents earth-relative eastward component of velocity of the fluid parcel (in m/s),
φ represents latitude (in rad), and
Ω represents angular rate of Earth's rotation (in rad/s , usually 2 π rad/1 sidereal day ≈ 72.921150 × 10−6 rad/s ).
At the North Pole and South Pole (latitude φ=±90°=π/2rad), no absolute angular momentum can exist (M=0 m2/s because cos(±90°)=0). If a fluid parcel with no eastward wind speed (u0=0m/s) originating at the equator (φ=0 rad so cos(φ)= cos(0 rad) = 1) conserves its angular momentum (M0 =M) as it moves poleward, then its eastward wind speed increases dramatically: u0 a cos(φ0) + Ω a2 cos2(φ0) = u a cos(φ) + Ω a2 cos2(φ). After those substitutions, Ω a2 = u a cos(φ) + Ω a2 cos2(φ), or after further simplification, Ω a(1-cos2(φ)) = u cos(φ). Solution for u gives Ω a(1/cos(φ) - cos(φ)) = u. If φ = 15° (cos(φ)=1+√3/2√2), then 72.921150 × 10−6 rad/s × 6.371009 Mm ×(2√2/1+√3 - 1+√3/2√2) ≈ 32.2m/s ≈ u.
The zonal pressure gradient and eddy stresses cause torque that changes the absolute angular momentum of fluid parcels.
