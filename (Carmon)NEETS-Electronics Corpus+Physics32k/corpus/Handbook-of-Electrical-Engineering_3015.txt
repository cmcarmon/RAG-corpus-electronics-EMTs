As in the cases of the common emitter and the common base ampliÔ¨Åers, the high frequency voltage gain,
driving point input resistance, and driving point output resistance can be approximated by functions having
analytical forms that are similar to those of Eqs. (28.15), (28.23), and (28.24). Let TpCC and TzCC designate the
time  constants  of  the  effective  dominant  pole  and  the  effective  dominant  zero,  respectively,  of  the  emitter
follower. Since the output port capacitance, Co, appears across a short circuit, TpCC is expressible as
