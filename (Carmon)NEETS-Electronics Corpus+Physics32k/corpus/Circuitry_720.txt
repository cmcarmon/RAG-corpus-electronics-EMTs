Typical  meter 
silicon  NPN 
transistors  are  shown  in  Fig.  15.8  (reverse  bias  is 
applied in Fig. 15.8(a) and forward bias is applied 
in  Fig.  15.8(b)).  Corresponding  indications  for 
germanium  NPN  transistors  will  be  somewhat 
lower.  Note  also  that  the  ×100  resistance  range 
should be used for measurements below 20 kH, and 
the  ×1k  resistance  range  should  be  used  for 
measurements above 20 kH.
