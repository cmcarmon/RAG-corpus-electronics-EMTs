Transmitting antennas may be either conformal or protruding. The protruding antennas are usually cheaper
and  simpler.  The  radiation  pattern  must  include  downward  directivity  if  an  aircraft  or  space  vehicle  will  ﬂy
directly overhead. A vertical whip antenna does not provide this coverage. A simple choice to provide smooth
coverage from the nadir to the horizon is circular polarization at the nadir and elliptic polarization in between.
A  circular  polarized  receiving  antenna  is  used  to  receive  the  signals  over  the  complete  pattern.  It  must  be
polarized in the same circular direction as the transmitting antenna. A spiral or helix antenna is usually used
on the ground. Two complete radio frequency systems are generally used to receive signals of any polarization.
One  system  uses  a  circular  polarized  right-hand  antenna  and  the  other  uses  a  circular  polarized  left-hand
antenna. In this manner, as the vehicle tilts or spins, signals are received continuously unless the transmitting
antenna is occluded. To receive occluded signals, diversity reception is required. Each receiving station is located
such that one ﬁlls in the occluded pattern of the other.
