The  operation  of  a  DC  motor  (Figure  18-18) 
 depends on the principle that a current-carrying con-
ductor, placed in and at right angles to a magnetic field, 
tends to move at right angles to the direction of the 
field. Figure 18-18A shows a magnetic field extending 
between a north pole and a south pole. Figure 18-18B 
shows the magnetic field that exists around a current-
carrying conductor. The plus sign implies that the cur-
rent flows inward. The direction of the flux lines can 
be determined using the left-hand rule. Figure 18-18C 
shows the conductor placed in the magnetic field. Note 
that both fields become distorted. Above the wire, the 
field is weakened, and the conductor tries to move up-
ward. The amount of force exerted upward depends 
on the strength of the field between the poles and the 
amount of current flowing through the conductor. If 
the current through the conductor is reversed (Figure 
18-18D), the direction of the magnetic flux around the 
conductor is reversed. If this occurs, the field below 
the conductor is weakened and the conductor tends to 
move downward.
