When using the general-purpose safety shorting probe, always be sure first to connect the grounding
clip to a good ground connection (if necessary, scrape the paint off the grounding metal to make a good
contact â€” paint can be replaced, lives can't). Then, while holding the safety shorting probe by the handle
behind the protective shield, touch the end of the metal rod to the points to be discharged. Touch each
point several times to ensure that the circuit is completely discharged. Be extremely careful that you do
not touch any of the metal parts of the safety shorting probe while touching the probe to the exposed "hot"
terminal. Don't develop a nonchalant or routine attitude about these procedures. It pays to be safe; use the
safety shorting probe with care.
