11.5.3 A three-phase transformer bank consisting of
three 10-kVA, 2300:230-V, 60-Hz, single-phase
transformers connected in Yâ€“ is used to step
down the voltage. The loads are connected to the
transformers by means of a common three-phase
low-voltage feeder whose series impedance is
0.005 + j0.01  per phase. The transform-
ers themselves are supplied by means of a
three-phase high-voltage feeder whose series
impedance is 0.5 + j5.0  per phase. The
equivalent series impedance of the single-phase
transformer referred to the low-voltage side is
0.12+j0.24 . The star point on the primary side
of the transformer bank is grounded. The load
consists of a heating load of 2 kW per phase and
a three-phase induction-motor load of 20 kVA
with a lagging power factor of 0.8, supplied at
230 V line-to-line.
