This chapter will include detailed design information for passive RLC ﬁlters; including Butterworth, Thomson,
and Chebyshev, both singly and doubly terminated. As the ﬁlter slope is increased in order to obtain greater
rejection of frequencies beyond cut-off, the complexity and cost are increased and the response to a step input
is worsened. In particular, the overshoot and the settling time are increased. The element values given are for
normalized low pass conﬁgurations to 5th order. All higher order doubly-terminated Butterworth ﬁlter element
values can be obtained using Takahasi’s equation, and an example is included. In order to use this information
in a practical ﬁlter these element values must be scaled. Scaling rules to denormalize in frequency and impedance
are given with examples. Since all data is for low-pass ﬁlters the transformation rules to change from low-pass
to high-pass and to band-pass ﬁlters are included with examples.
