BSIM3. Realizing the shortcomings of BSIM2, UC Berkeley recently introduced the BSIM3 model. This is an
unfortunate choice of name because it implies BSIM3 is related to BSIM and BSIM2. In reality, BSIM3 is an
entirely new model that in some sense is related more to level 2 and 3 than BSIM or BSIM2. The BSIM3 model
abandons the length and width dependence approach of BSIM and BSIM2, preferring to go back to incorpo-
rating the geometry dependence directly into the model equations, as do level 2 and 3. In addition, BSIM3 is
a more physically based model, with about 30 Ô¨Åtting parameters (the model has many more parameters, but
