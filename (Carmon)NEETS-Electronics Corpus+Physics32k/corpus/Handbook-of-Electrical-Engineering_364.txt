AC  steady-state  power: Consider  an  ac  source  connected  at  a  pair  of  terminals  to  an  otherwise  isolated
network. Let 
 denote the peak values, respectively, of the ac steady-state voltage and
current at the terminals. Furthermore, let q denote the phase angle by which the voltage leads the current.
Then the average power delivered by the source to the network would be expressed as P = *V* Â· *I* cos(q).
