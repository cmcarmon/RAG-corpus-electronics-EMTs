Each electron advancing clockwise in this circuit pushes on the one in front of it, which
pushes on the one in front of it, and so on, and so on, just like a hula-hoop ﬁlled with marbles.
Now, we have the capability of supporting a continuous ﬂow of electrons indeﬁnitely without
the need for inﬁnite electron supplies and dumps. All we need to maintain this ﬂow is a
continuous means of motivation for those electrons, which we’ll address in the next section of
this chapter.
