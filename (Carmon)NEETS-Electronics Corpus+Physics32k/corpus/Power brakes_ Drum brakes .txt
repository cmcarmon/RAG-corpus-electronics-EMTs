Another type of power brake installed in automobiles is called the drum brake. This type of brake, in general, will create some friction that will slow down the wheel. How this works is there is a brake cylinder that connects master cylinder to the drum brake via brake lines that transfer pressure from the master cylinder. When the driver pushes the brake pedal with his/her foot, the pistons inside the cylinder will activate. The activation of this piston will allow two brake shoes located within the drum of the brake to expand, thus generating friction to slow down and stop the wheel. Usually, this brake is located in the rear wheels of the vehicle, while the disk brake is located at the front of the vehicle. A car may also have only drum brakes or disc brakes both front and rear.
