Microprocessors  offer  advantages  in  trafﬁc  control  situations  in  addition  to  optimized  trafﬁc  ﬂow. When
properly designed, the system can provide a certain degree of fault tolerance. When a loop detector is giving a
faulty value, the system can be programmed to ignore its value and use values from adjoining lanes. An error
report can be forwarded to a central trafﬁc facility and after repairs are made, the loop brought automatically
on-line. The system can also monitor feedback information from the trafﬁc light to ensure that the lights are
actually lit. When a problem is detected, the system can enter an emergency mode and report the problem.
