Assume that we have a set of points in





R


d




{\textstyle \mathbb {R} ^{d}}
(dimension



d


{\textstyle d}
). Instead of assigning one distribution to the set of points, we can cluster them and represent the point set in terms of the clusters. Thus, each cluster is a single point in





R


d




{\textstyle \mathbb {R} ^{d}}
and the weight of the cluster is decided by the fraction of the distribution present in that cluster. This representation of a distribution by a set of clusters is called the signature. Two signatures can have different sizes, for example, a bimodal distribution has shorter signature (2 clusters) than complex ones. One cluster representation (mean or mode in





R


d




{\textstyle \mathbb {R} ^{d}}
) can be thought of as a single feature in a signature. The distance between each of the features is called as ground distance.
The EMD problem can be solved as a transportation problem. Suppose that several suppliers, each with a given amount of goods, are required to supply several consumers, each with a given limited capacity. For each supplier-consumer pair, the cost of transporting a single unit of goods is given. The transportation problem is then to find a least-expensive flow of goods from the suppliers to the consumers that satisfies the consumers' demand. Similarly, here the problem is transforming one signature(

Q


{\textstyle Q}
) with minimum work done.
Assume that signature

{\textstyle P}
