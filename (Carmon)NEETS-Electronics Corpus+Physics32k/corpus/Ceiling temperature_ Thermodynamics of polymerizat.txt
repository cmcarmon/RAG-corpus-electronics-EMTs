At constant temperature, the reversibility of polymerization can be determined using the Gibbs free energy equation:

denote the activation energies for polymerization and depolymerization, respectively.
Entropy is the measure of randomness or chaos. A system has a lower entropy when there are few objects in the system and has a higher entropy when there are many objects in the system. Because the process of depolymerization involves a polymer being broken down into its monomers, depolymerization increases entropy. In the Gibbs free energy equation, the entropy term is negative. Enthalpy drives polymerizations. At low temperatures, the enthalpy term is greater than the

{\displaystyle T\Delta S_{p}}
term, which allows polymerization to occur. At the ceiling temperature, the enthalpy term and the entropy term are equal, so that the overall rate of polymerization is zero. Above the ceiling temperature, the rate of depolymerization is greater than the rate of polymerization, which inhibits the formation of the given polymer. The ceiling temperature can be defined by
