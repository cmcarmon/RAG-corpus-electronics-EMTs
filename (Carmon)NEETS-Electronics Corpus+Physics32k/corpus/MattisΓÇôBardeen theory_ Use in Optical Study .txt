The calculated optical conductivity breaks the sum rule that the spectral weight should be conserved through the transition. This result implies that the missing area of the spectral weight is concentrated in the zero frequency limit, corresponding to the dirac delta function (which covers the conduction of the superconducting condensate, i.e. the Cooper pairs). Many experimental data supports the prediction. This story on electrodynamics of superconductivity is the starting point of optical study. Because any superconducting Tc never exceeds 200K and the superconducting gap value is about the 3.5 kBT, microwave or far-infrared spectroscopy is suitable technique applying this theory. With the Mattisâ€“Bardeen theory, we can derive fruitful properties of superconducting gap, like gap symmetry.
