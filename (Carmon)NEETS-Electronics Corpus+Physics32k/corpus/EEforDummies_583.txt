Keep the same two pot leads together so that the pot is providing 0 ohms 
of resistance to the circuit. Make sure you orient the LED properly, with 
the cathode (negative side) connected to the negative battery  terminal. 
(Remember that the cathode has a shorter lead and a larger plate inside 
the plastic housing.)
