In the gas plasma and electroluminescent displays, the picture element light is generated by ionizing 
a gas (neon or neon argon) between the charged electrodes (gas plasma display) or by stimulating a 
luminescent material in the same manner (electroluminescent display). In either case, the picture element 
only emits light when the electrodes have voltage applied to them.
