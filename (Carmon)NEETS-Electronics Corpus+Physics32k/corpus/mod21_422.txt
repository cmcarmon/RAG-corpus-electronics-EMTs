System testing and monitoring are frequently accomplished by using an external piece of electronic
equipment, which is designed specifically for testing a particular system. Some computers and computer
systems build in their own monitoring and testing devices and will inform the operator when and where
failure has occurred. You must realize that any equipment designed to test, monitor, or repair another
system is itself subject to malfunction and will require periodic checks and preventive maintenance. This
chapter will cover some of the basic test methods and practices associated with system-level
troubleshooting.
