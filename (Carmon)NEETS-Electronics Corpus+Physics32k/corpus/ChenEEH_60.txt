As was mentioned earlier, only capacitors and inductors are
capable of storing energy in a circuit, and so only the variables
associated with them are able to inï¬‚uence the future condition
of the circuit. The voltages across the capacitors and the
currents through the inductors may serve as state variables. If
loops are not solely made up of capacitors and voltage sources,
then the voltages across all the capacitors are independent
