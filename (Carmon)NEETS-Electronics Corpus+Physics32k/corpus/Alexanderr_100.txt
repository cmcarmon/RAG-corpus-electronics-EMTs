Another application where resistors are used to control current ﬂow
is  in  the  analog  dc  meters—the  ammeter,  voltmeter,  and  ohmmeter,
which  measure  current,  voltage,  and  resistance,  respectively.  Each  of
these  meters  employs  the  d’Arsonval  meter  movement,  shown  in
Fig. 2.58. The movement consists essentially of a movable iron-core coil
mounted  on  a  pivot  between  the  poles  of  a  permanent  magnet.  When
current ﬂows through the coil, it creates a torque which causes the pointer
to deﬂect. The amount of current through the coil determines the deﬂec-
tion of the pointer, which is registered on a scale attached to the meter
movement. For example, if the meter movement is rated 1 mA, 50 
it
would take 1 mA to cause a full-scale deﬂection of the meter movement.
By  introducing  additional  circuitry  to  the  d’Arsonval  meter  movement,
an ammeter, voltmeter, or ohmmeter can be constructed.
