(cid:1) Most useful Op Amp circuits are built using the negative feedback connec-
tion, in which a portion of the output signal of the Op Amp is fed back to
the v
input of the Op Amp. Examples of Op Amp circuits built this way
include inverting and non-inverting amplifiers, buffers, adders, integrators,
and differentiators.
