 The direction of this induced voltage may be determined by applying the LEFT-HAND RULE FOR 
GENERATORS. This rule is applied to a portion of conductor 2 that is "lifted" and enlarged for this 
purpose in figure 2-2(A). This rule states that if you point the thumb of your left hand in the direction of 
relative motion of the conductor and your index finger in the direction of the magnetic field, your middle 
finger, extended as shown, will now indicate the direction of the induced current which will generate the 
induced voltage (cemf) as shown.
