. Parallelism: Higher device density and larger chip area
promise to pack millions of transistors on a single chip.
This makes it feasible to exploit parallel processing to
achieve an even higher throughput rate by processing
multiple data streams concurrently. To fully exploit the
beneÔ¨Åt of parallel processing, however, the formulation of
signal processing algorithms must be reexamined. Algo-
rithm transformation techniques are also developed to
exploit maximum parallelism from a given DSP algo-
rithm formulation.
