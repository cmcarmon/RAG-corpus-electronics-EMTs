Thus far we have shown how to ﬁnd the truth table for a given combination of logic blocks.
The inverse process, that of ﬁnding an interconnection of blocks to produce a given truth table,
is known as logic synthesis. Even though the resulting circuit is not necessarily minimal (thereby
assuming a minimum number of components), the truth table can be realized by the two standard
forms: sum of products (SOP) and product of sums (POS). SOP can be implemented by using
two-level (AND–OR) networks, where each product term requires an AND gate (except for a
term with a single variable) and the logic sum of these terms is obtained by using an OR gate with
inputs from the AND gates or the single variables. POS can be implemented by using two-level
(OR–AND) networks, where each term requires an OR gate (except for a term with a single
variable) and the product of these terms is obtained by using an AND gate with inputs from the
OR gates or the single variables.
