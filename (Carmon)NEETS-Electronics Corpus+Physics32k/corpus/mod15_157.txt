Some synchro systems contain a differential and a control transformer, as illustrated in figure 1-32. 
In this figure, there are large stator currents flowing in the CX, since it supplies all the losses as well as 
the magnetizing current for both synchros. Two meters are placed in the circuit to show the value of stator 
current for the CDX and CT. Another meter is placed in series with the ac excitation voltage to show the 
amount of current being drawn from the ac line is 0.9 ampere.
