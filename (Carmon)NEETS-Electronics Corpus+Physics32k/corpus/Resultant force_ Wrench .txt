The forces and torques acting on a rigid body can be assembled into the pair of vectors called a wrench.If a system of forces and torques has a net resultant force F and a net resultant torque T, then the entire system can be replaced by a force F and an arbitrarily located couple that yields a torque of T. In general, if F and T are orthogonal, it is possible to derive a radial vector R such that




R

F

T



{\displaystyle \mathbf {R} \times \mathbf {F} =\mathbf {T} }
, meaning that the single force F, acting at displacement R, can replace the system. If the system is zero-force (torque only), it is termed a screw and is mathematically formulated as screw theory.
The resultant force and torque on a rigid body obtained from a system of forces Fi i=1,...,n, is simply the sum of the individual wrenches Wi, that is

{\displaystyle {\mathsf {W}}=\sum _{i=1}^{n}{\mathsf {W}}_{i}=\sum _{i=1}^{n}(\mathbf {F} _{i},\mathbf {R} _{i}\times \mathbf {F} _{i}).}

Notice that the case of two equal but opposite forces F and -F acting at points A and B respectively, yields the resultant W=(F-F, A×F - B× F) = (0, (A-B)×F). This shows that wrenches of the form W=(0, T) can be interpreted as pure torques.
