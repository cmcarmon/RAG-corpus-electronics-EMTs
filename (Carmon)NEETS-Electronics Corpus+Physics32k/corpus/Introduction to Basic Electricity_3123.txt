Figure 30-3 shows a typical zener diode regulator 
circuit. The zener diode is connected in series with 
 resistor RS. The resistor allows enough current to flow 
for the zener diode to operate in the zener breakdown  
region. The DC input voltage must be higher than 
the zener diode breakdown voltage. The voltage drop 
across the zener diode is equal to the zener  diodeâ€™s 
voltage rating. Zener diodes are manufactured to
