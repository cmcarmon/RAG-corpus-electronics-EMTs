Los Angeles Detective Brett Hopper is stuck repeating the same day, in which he is framed for the murder of the Assistant District Attorney, Alberto Garza. Each day, he attempts to uncover clues to the homicide that has him on the run for his freedom. Hopper must clear his name, but those close to him get caught in the web of conspiracy that will put their lives in danger.
The days can get complicated with each decision he makes as he tries various tactics to fight or flee the murder allegations. At least one other individual seems to be repeating the same day as Hopper, but his actions rarely affect Hopper's case unless they happen to be working together on that iteration of the day.
While episodes may start at any time of the day and may contain multiple days or parts of days, Hopper begins each day by waking up at 6:17 a.m. and viewing his clock turn to 6:18 a.m. Hopper only carries his memories and his body, with any injuries, over into the next repetition of the day. However, injuries to other individuals do not carry over to the next day.
If Hopper makes enough of a difference in one situation, related events are sometimes altered. He also sometimes has flashbacks from before the repeating day.
This generally involves an individual waking up with a sense of apprehension or a newfound perspective concerning the object or relationship that Hopper affected in a previous iteration of the day. These changes can be reversed, as in the cases of Andrea deciding to check her boyfriend into a drug rehabilitation center and Rita's feelings towards Hopper in episodes 11, 12 and 13.
