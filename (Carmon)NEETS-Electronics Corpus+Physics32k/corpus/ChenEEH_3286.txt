If a load is applied to the armature windings, then current will
ﬂow and the armature ﬂux will link with the ﬁeld. This effec-
tively puts a mechanical load on the rotor, and power input
must be matched to this load to maintain the desired constant
frequency. Some of the armature ﬂux ‘‘leaks’’ and does not link
with the ﬁeld. In addition, there are winding resistive losses,
but those are commonly neglected. The circuit model shown in
Figure 7.8 is a good representation for the synchronous gener-
ator in the steady-state. Note that most generators are operated
at some ﬁxed terminal voltage with a constant power output.
Thus, for steady-state studies, the generator is often referred to
as a PV bus since the terminal node has ﬁxed power P and
voltage V.
