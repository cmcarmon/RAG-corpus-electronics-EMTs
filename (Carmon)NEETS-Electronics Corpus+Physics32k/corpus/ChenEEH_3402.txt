The most basic power system components are generators,
transformers,
transmission lines, busses, and loads. They
allow for power to be generated (generators), transformed
from one voltage level to another (transformers), transmit-
ted from one location to another (transmission lines), distrib-
uted among a number of
transmission lines and power
transformers (busses), and used by consumers (loads). In the
course of doing this, the power system components are being
switched or connected in a variety of different conﬁgurations
using circuit breakers and associated switches (Horowitz and
Phadke, 1992; Blackburn, 1998; Ungrad et al., 1995). The
circuit breakers are capable of interrupting the ﬂow of power
at a high energy level and, hence, may also be used to discon-
nect the system components on an emergency basis, such as in
the case when the component experiences a fault (Flurscheim,
1985). Because the power systems are built to cover a large
geographical area, the power system components are scattered
across the area and interconnected with transmission lines.
The grouping of the components associated with generation,
switching, transformation, or consumption are called power
plants (generation and transformation), substations (trans-
formation and switching), and load centers (switching, trans-
formation, and consumption). In turn, the related monitoring,
control, protection, and communication gear is also located at
the mentioned facilities.
