Passivity is an important property of dynamic systems. A large
class of physical systems, such as ﬂexible space structures with
collocated and compatible actuators and sensors, can be clas-
siﬁed as being naturally passive. A passive system can be
robustly stabilized by any strictly passive controller despite
unmodeled dynamics and parametric uncertainties. This im-
portant stability characteristic has attracted much attention of
researchers in the control of passive systems. This section
presents selected deﬁnitions and stability theorems for passive
linear systems.
