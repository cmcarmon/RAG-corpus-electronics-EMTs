When the tap delay implements the short-term memory, straight back-propagation can be utilized since the
only adaptive parameters are the MLP weights. When the gamma memory is utilized (or the context PE), the
recursive  parameter  is  adapted  in  a  total  adaptive  framework  (or  the  parameter  is  preset  by  some  external
consideration). The equations to adapt the context PE and the gamma memory are shown in Figs. 20.11 and
20.12, respectively. For the context PE d(n) refers to the total error that is back-propagated from the MLP and
that reaches the dual context PE.
