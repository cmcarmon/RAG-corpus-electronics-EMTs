The left-hand side of the equation contains radar design parameters, while the right-hand side is determined
by  target  characteristics  and  operational  requirements.  The  right-hand  side  of  the  equation  is  evaluated  to
determine radar requirements. The left-hand side of the equation is evaluated to determine if the radar design
meets the requirements.
