Another tube based on velocity modulation, and used to generate microwave energy, is the REFLEX 
KLYSTRON (figure 2-9). The reflex klystron contains a REFLECTOR PLATE, referred to as the 
REPELLER, instead of the output cavity used in other types of klystrons. The electron beam is modulated 
as it was in the other types of klystrons by passing it through an oscillating resonant cavity, but here the 
similarity ends. The feedback required to maintain oscillations within the cavity is obtained by reversing 
the beam and sending it back through the cavity. The electrons in the beam are velocity-modulated before 
the beam passes through the cavity the second time and will give up the energy required to maintain
