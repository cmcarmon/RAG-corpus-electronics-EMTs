In review, holes constantly drift toward the negative 
terminal of the voltage source. Electrons always flow 
toward the positive terminal. Current flow in a semi-
conductor consists of the movement of both electrons 
and holes. The amount of current flow is determined 
by the number of electron-hole pairs in the material. 
The ability to support current flow increases with the 
temperature of the material.
