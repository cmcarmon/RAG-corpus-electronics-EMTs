which are shown in Figure 5.7(A). The ﬁrst component repre-
sents the back injection into the (neutral) emitter, with an
ideality factor mBEi that is usually slightly larger than one.
This component dominates at low- to high-current densities
and remains unaffected by high-current effects for many pro-
cesses; that is, it keeps increasing almost ideally with VB0E0 . The
second component represents the recombination loss in the BE
SCR, with an ideality factor mREi that is close to two. This
component dominates for Si BJTs only at very low-current
densities. The component ijBCi across the BC junction can be
described similarly. The total internal dc base current is then
IBi ¼ IjBEi þ IjBCi.
