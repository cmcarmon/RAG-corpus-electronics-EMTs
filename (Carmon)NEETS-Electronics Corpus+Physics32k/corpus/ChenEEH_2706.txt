of Faraday’s
law contours.
For example, it is possible to identify Yee ~EE compo-
nents associated with displacement current ﬂux linking
~HH loops as well as ~HH components associated with
magnetic ﬂux linking ~EE loops. In effect, the Yee algo-
rithm simultaneously simulates the pointwise differen-
tial
form of
Maxwell’s equations. The latter possibility is extremely
useful in specifying ﬁeld boundary conditions and sin-
gularities.
