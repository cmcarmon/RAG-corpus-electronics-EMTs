With forward bias, the resistance of the point-contact diode is higher than that of the junction diode. 
With reverse bias, the current flow through a point-contact diode is not as independent of the voltage 
applied to the crystal as it is in the junction diode. The point-contact diode has an advantage over the 
junction diode because the capacitance between the catwhisker and the crystal is less than the capacitance 
between the two sides of the junction diode. As such, the capacitive reactance existing across the point-
contact diode is higher and the capacitive current that will flow in the circuit at high frequencies is 
smaller. A cutaway view of the entire point-contact diode is shown in figure 2-51C. The schematic 
symbol of a point-contact diode is shown in figure 2-51D.
