Noise signals have little structure and arise from both human and natural sources. Satellite channels are
subject to deep space noise arising from electromagnetic radiation pervasive in the galaxy. Thermal noise
plagues all electronic circuits that contain resistors. Thus, in receiving small amplitude signals, receiver
ampliﬁers will most certainly add noise as they boost the signal’s amplitude. All channels are subject to
noise, and we need a way of describing such signals despite the fact we can’t write a formula for the noise
signal like we can for interference. The most widely used noise model is white noise. It is deﬁned entirely
by its frequency-domain characteristics.
