If the sampling theorem is not satisﬁed, aliasing will occur. Aliasing occurs when the signal is undersampled
and therefore no longer recoverable by low-pass ﬁltering. Figure 17.11(a) shows the frequency spectrum of a
sampled bandlimited signal with no aliasing. Figure 17.11(b) shows the frequency response of the same signal
with aliasing. The aliasing occurs at the points where there is overlap in the diamond-shaped regions. For video
signals  aliasing  in  the  temporal  direction  will  give  rise  to  ﬂicker  on  the  display.  For  television  systems,  the
standard  temporal  sampling  rate  is  30  frames  per  second  in  the  United  States  and  Japan  and  25  frames  per
second in Europe. However, these rates would be insufﬁcient without the use of interlacing.
