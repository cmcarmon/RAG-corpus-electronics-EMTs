Log-Periodic Dipole Arrays
Another variation of wire antenna arrays is the log-peri-
odic dipole array. The log-periodic is popular in applica-
tions  that  require  a  broadband,  frequency-independent
antenna. An antenna will be independent of frequency if
its  dimensions,  when  measured  in  wavelengths,  remain
constant for all frequencies. If, however, an antenna is designed so that its characteristic dimensions are periodic
with the logarithm of the frequency, and if the characteristic dimensions do not vary too much over a period
of time, then the antenna will be essentially frequency independent. This is the basis for the log-periodic dipole
array, shown in Fig. 38.6.
