Luke's Lagrangian formulation is for non-linear surface gravity waves on an—incompressible, irrotational and inviscid—potential flow.
The relevant ingredients, needed in order to describe this flow, are:
Φ(x,z,t) is the velocity potential,
ρ is the fluid density,
g is the acceleration by the Earth's gravity,
x is the horizontal coordinate vector with components x and y,
x and y are the horizontal coordinates,
z is the vertical coordinate,
t is time, and
∇ is the horizontal gradient operator, so ∇Φ is the horizontal flow velocity consisting of ∂Φ/∂x and ∂Φ/∂y,
V(t) is the time-dependent fluid domain with free surface.
The Lagrangian

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}=-\int _{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}\left\{\iiint _{V(t)}\rho \left[{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial t}}+{\frac {1}{2}}\left|{\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\Phi \right|^{2}+{\frac {1}{2}}\left({\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial z}}\right)^{2}+g\,z\right]\;{\text{d}}x\;{\text{d}}y\;{\text{d}}z\;\right\}\;{\text{d}}t.}

From Bernoulli's principle, this Lagrangian can be seen to be the integral of the fluid pressure over the whole time-dependent fluid domain V(t). This is in agreement with the variational principles for inviscid flow without a free surface, found by Harry Bateman.
Variation with respect to the velocity potential Φ(x,z,t) and free-moving surfaces like z=η(x,t) results in the Laplace equation for the potential in the fluid interior and all required boundary conditions: kinematic boundary conditions on all fluid boundaries and dynamic boundary conditions on free surfaces. This may also include moving wavemaker walls and ship motion.
For the case of a horizontally unbounded domain with the free fluid surface at z=η(x,t) and a fixed bed at z=−h(x), Luke's variational principle results in the Lagrangian:

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {L}}=-\,\int _{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}\iint \left\{\int _{-h({\boldsymbol {x}})}^{\eta ({\boldsymbol {x}},t)}\rho \,\left[{\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial t}}+\,{\frac {1}{2}}\left|{\boldsymbol {\nabla }}\Phi \right|^{2}+\,{\frac {1}{2}}\left({\frac {\partial \Phi }{\partial z}}\right)^{2}\right]\;{\text{d}}z\;+\,{\frac {1}{2}}\,\rho \,g\,\eta ^{2}\right\}\;{\text{d}}{\boldsymbol {x}}\;{\text{d}}t.}

The bed-level term proportional to h2 in the potential energy has been neglected, since it is a constant and does not contribute in the variations. Below, Luke's variational principle is used to arrive at the flow equations for non-linear surface gravity waves on a potential flow.
