. Scanner is an electronic device that uses light-sensing
equipment to scan paper images (e.g., text, photos, and
illustrations) and translate the images into data that the
computer can then store, modify, or distribute. Some
common data formats are PDF, GIF IPG, TIF and BMP.
The most common software interface is called TWAIN.
Although TWAIN stands for nothing, some prefer to call
it ‘‘toolkit without an interesting name’’. Any software can
access the scanner through a TWAIN interface. Software
