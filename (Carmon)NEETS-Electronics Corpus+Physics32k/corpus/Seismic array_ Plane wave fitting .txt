Another way of estimating slowness is to pick carefully times of the first onset or any other common distinguishable part of the same phase (same cycle) for all instruments in an array. Let ti be the arrival time picked at site i, and tref be the arrival time at the reference site, then τi = ti − tref is the observed time delay at site i. We observe the plane wave at M sites. With M ≥ 3. The horizontal components (sx, sy) of the slowness vector s can be estimated by

Plane wave fitting requires interactive analyst's work. However, to obtain automatic time picks and thereby provide a slowness estimate automatically, techniques like cross-correlation or just picking of peak amplitude within a time window may be used. Because of the amount of required computations, plane wave fitting is most effective for arrays with a smaller number of sites or for subarray configurations.
