All bounded orbits where the gravity of a central body dominates are elliptical in nature. A special case of this is the circular orbit, which is an ellipse of zero eccentricity. The formula for the velocity of a body in a circular orbit at distance r from the center of gravity of mass M can be derived as follows -
Centrifugal acceleration matches the acceleration due to gravity.
So,

{\displaystyle v^{2}/r=GM/r^{2}}

Therefore,





v

{\displaystyle \ v={\sqrt {{\frac {GM}{r}}\ }}}

where



G


{\displaystyle G}
is the gravitational constant, equal to
6.673 84 × 10−11 m3/(kg·s2)
To properly use this formula, the units must be consistent; for example,



M


{\displaystyle M}
must be in kilograms, and



r


{\displaystyle r}
must be in meters. The answer will be in meters per second.
The quantity



G
M


{\displaystyle GM}
is often termed the standard gravitational parameter, which has a different value for every planet or moon in the Solar System.
Once the circular orbital velocity is known, the escape velocity is easily found by multiplying by the square root of 2:

{\displaystyle \ v={\sqrt {2}}{\sqrt {{\frac {GM}{r}}\ }}={\sqrt {{\frac {2GM}{r}}\ }}.}

To escape from gravity, the kinetic energy must at least match the negative potential energy. So,
