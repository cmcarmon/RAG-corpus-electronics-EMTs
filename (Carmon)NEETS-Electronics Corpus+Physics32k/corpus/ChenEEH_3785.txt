Inasmuch as LMs ultimately imply structure that assists in
pattern-matching and search, some of the techniques and
algorithms discussed in earlier sections are directly applicable
to the LM’ing problem. The ﬁeld of LM’ing, however, has
developed largely outside of the SP discipline—principally in
certain areas of computer science,
linguistics, and related
ﬁelds—so the vocabulary and concepts of LM’ing can seem
unfamiliar to the traditional SP engineer, even when the tech-
niques are similar to SP methods. Further, the abstraction
of some of the problems encountered in LM’ing (e.g., the
meaning of an utterance) defy the construction of rigorously
quantiﬁed models, which is another break from the SP engi-
neer’s typical approach to problem solving.
