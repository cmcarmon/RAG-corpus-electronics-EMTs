An intuitive way to understand the behavior of voltage and current in electronic 
circuits  is  to  use  hydrodynamic  systems  as  an  analogue.  In  this  system,  voltage  is 
represented  by  gravitational  potential  or  height  of  the  fluid  column,  and  current  is 
represented  by  the  fluid  flow  rate.  Diagrams  of  these  concepts  are  show  in  Figure  1.5 
through  1.7.  As  the  following  sections  will  explain,  electrical  components  such  as 
resistors,  capacitors,  inductors,  and  transistors  can  all  be  represented  by  equivalent 
mechanical devices that support this analogy.
