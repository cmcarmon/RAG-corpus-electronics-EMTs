When two solid surfaces are brought into close proximity, they experience attractive van der Waals forces. Bradley's van der Waals model provides a means of calculating the tensile force between two rigid spheres with perfectly smooth surfaces. The Hertzian model of contact does not consider adhesion possible. However, in the late 1960s, several contradictions were observed when the Hertz theory was compared with experiments involving contact between rubber and glass spheres.
It was observed that, though Hertz theory applied at large loads, at low loads
the area of contact was larger than that predicted by Hertz theory,
the area of contact had a non-zero value even when the load was removed, and
there was strong adhesion if the contacting surfaces were clean and dry.
This indicated that adhesive forces were at work. The Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) model and the Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov (DMT) models were the first to incorporate adhesion into Hertzian contact.
