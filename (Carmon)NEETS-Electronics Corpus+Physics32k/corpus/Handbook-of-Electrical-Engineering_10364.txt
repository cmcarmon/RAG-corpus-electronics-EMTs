Phase II of the space station program begins in November 1997 with the launch of the FGB functional
cargo block on a Russian Proton vehicle. The FGB is a 21-ton element that will provide altitude control
and propulsion during the early assembly operations, plus solar power and berthing ports for additional
modules. In May of 1998, the embryo space station will grow with the addition of the  Proton-boosted
Russian service module, which provides life support and habitation facilities, utilities, and thrusters. Then
the crew transfer vehicle, a Russian Soyuz TM capsule, will be joined to the station. By June 1998, the
Ô¨Årst three-person crew will begin its orbital stay. Phase II will be completed in Spring of 1999.
