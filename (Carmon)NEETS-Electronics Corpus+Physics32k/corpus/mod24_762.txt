remove some of the high frequency noise before the signal is further processed. The digital receiver
generally contains a comparator, which reshapes the amplified electrical signal to remove any distortions
introduced in the transmission process. In some cases the receiver may also contain clock recovery
circuitry, which retimes the output electrical signal as well.
