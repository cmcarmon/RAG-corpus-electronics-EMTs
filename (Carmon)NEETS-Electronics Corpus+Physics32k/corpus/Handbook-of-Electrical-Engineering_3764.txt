Figure  37.3  depicts  the  electromagnetic  energy  transmission  between  two  antennas  in  space. As  the  wave
radiates from the transmitting antenna and propagates in space, its power density decreases, as expressed ideally
in  Eq.  (37.19). Assuming  that  the  antennas  are  in  free  space,  the  power  received  by  the  receiving  antenna  is
given by the Friis transmission equation [Liu and Fang, 1988]:
