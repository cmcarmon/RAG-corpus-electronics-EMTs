Testing of electronic circuits, which has long been pursued as an activity that follows the design and manufacture
of (at least) the prototype product, has currently become a topic of up-front investigation and commitment.
Today,  it  is  not  uncommon  to  list  the design  for  testability  (DFT)  features  of  a  product  among  the  so-called
functional requirements in the deÔ¨Ånition of a new product to be developed. Just how such a major transfor-
mation has occurred can be understood by examining the testability problems faced by manufacturing orga-
nizations and considering their impact on time to market (TTM).
