where  AV(OL)  is  the  open-loop  voltage  gain,  VOUT 
and  VIN  are 
input  voltages 
respectively under open-loop conditions.  
 
In linear voltage amplifying applications, a large 
amount  of  negative  feedback  will  normally  be 
applied  and  the  open-loop  voltage  gain  can  be 
thought of as the internal voltage gain provided by 
the device.  
  The open-loop voltage gain is often expressed in 
decibels (dB) rather than as a ratio. In this case:
