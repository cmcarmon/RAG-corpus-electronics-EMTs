With the two techniques to be developed in this chapter, we can ana-
lyze any linear circuit by obtaining a set of simultaneous equations that
are then solved to obtain the required values of current or voltage. One
method of solving simultaneous equations involves Cramer’s rule, which
allows us to calculate circuit variables as a quotient of determinants. The
examples  in  the  chapter  will  illustrate  this  method;  Appendix  A also
brieﬂy summarizes the essentials the reader needs to know for applying
Cramer’s  rule. Another  method  of  solving  simultaneous  equations  is  to
use MATLAB, a computer software discussed in Appendix E.
