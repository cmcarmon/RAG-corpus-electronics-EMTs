Have you ever walked up to someone’s dark 
doorway when suddenly the outdoor lights turn 
on? Or witnessed a garage door stop descend­
ing  when  a  child  or  wheeled  object  crosses 
below it? If so, you’ve seen motion detectors at 
work. Motion‐detection devices commonly use 
light sensors to detect either the presence of 
infrared light emitted from a warm object (such 
as a person or animal) or the absence of infra­
red light when an object interrupts a beam emit­
ted by another part of the device.
Many  homes,  schools,  and  stores  use  pas-
sive infrared (PIR) motion detectors to turn on 
lights or detect intruders. PIR motion detec­
tors contain a sensor (which usually consists 
of two crystals), a lens, and a small electronic 
circuit.  When  infrared  light  hits  a  crystal,  it 
generates an electric charge. Because warm 
bodies (such as those of most humans) emit 
infrared  light  at  different  wavelengths  than 
cooler  objects  (such  as  a  wall),  differences 
in the output of the PIR sensor can be used 
to detect the presence of a warm body. The 
electronic circuit interprets differences in the 
PIR sensor output to determine whether or not
