Example 1.6 
 
An  indicator  lamp  requires  a  current  of  0.075  A. 
Express this in mA. 
 
Solution 
 
You can express the current in mA (rather than in 
A) by simply moving the decimal point three places 
to the right. Hence 0.075 A is the same as 75 mA. 
 
Example 1.7 
 
A medium-wave  radio  transmitter  operates  on  a 
frequency  of  1,495  kHz.  Express  its  frequency  in 
MHz. 
 
Solution 
 
To express the frequency in MHz rather than kHz 
we need to move the decimal point three places to 
the  left.  Hence  1,495  kHz  is  equivalent  to  1.495 
MHz. 
 
Example 1.8 
 
A the value of a 27,000 pF in µF. 
 
Solution 
 
To express the value in µF rather than pF we need 
to  move  the  decimal  point  six  places  to  the  left. 
Hence  27,000  pF  is  equivalent  to  0.027  µF  (note 
that we have had to introduce an extra zero before 
the 2 and after the decimal point).
