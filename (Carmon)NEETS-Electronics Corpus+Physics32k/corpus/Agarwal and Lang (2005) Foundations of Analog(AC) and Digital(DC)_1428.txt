Let us first analyze the circuit qualitatively. Consider the case where vIN1 has
been high for a long period of time and focus on the part of the circuit bounded
by the dashed box in the Figure 10.19, which includes the load resistor and
RON of inverter A and the gate-to-source capacitor of inverter B. Since the
circuit is in its steady state, the capacitor behaves as an open circuit, and so the
voltage across the capacitor will be established by the voltage-divider subcircuit
comprising the supply VS, and the resistors RL and RON. Assuming RL (cid:5) RON,
the capacitor voltage will have a low value (close to 0 volts).
