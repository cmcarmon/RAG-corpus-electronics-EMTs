It is possible for the circuit current to increase without a direct short. If a resistor, capacitor, or
inductor changes value, the total circuit impedance will also change in value. If a resistor decreases in
ohmic value, the total circuit resistance decreases. If a capacitor has a dielectric leakage, the capacitive
reactance decreases. If an inductor has a partial short of its winding, inductive reactance decreases. Any
of these conditions will cause an increase in circuit current. Since the circuit wiring and components are
designed to withstand normal circuit current, an increase in current would cause overheating (just as in
the case of a direct short). Therefore, excessive current without a direct short will cause the same
problems as a direct short.
