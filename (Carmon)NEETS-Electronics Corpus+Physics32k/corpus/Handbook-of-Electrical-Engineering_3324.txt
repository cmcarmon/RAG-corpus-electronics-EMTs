Semiconductor Detector Arrays
Detector arrays have been made using either photodiodes or photoconductors. The applications are for visible
and  infrared  imaging  devices.  For  small-sized  arrays  each  detector  is  individually  connected  to  an  electrical
lead on the package. This becomes impossible for large arrays, however, and these contain additional electronic
switching circuits to provide sequential access to each diode.
