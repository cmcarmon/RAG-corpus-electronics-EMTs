The problem of ﬁnding the best source code then reduces to ﬁnding the optimal set of lengths that satisﬁes
the Kraft inequality and minimizes the average length of the code. Simple calculus can then be used to show
[Cover and Thomas, 1991] that the average length of any instantaneous code is larger than the entropy of the
random variable, i.e., the minimum of (pili over all li satisfying ( 2–li £ 1 is –(pi log pi . Also, if we take li =
Ølog 1/pi ø (where Øtø denotes the smallest integer greater than or equal to t), we can verify that this choice of
lengths satisﬁes the Kraft inequality and that
