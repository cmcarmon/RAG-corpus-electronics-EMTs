Vehicular systems have evolved and incorporated advances from many other ﬁelds of technology over the past
decade. Instrumentation and controls for the various modes (aircraft, marine vessels, cars, trucks, buses, and
rail vehicles) resemble each other more every year. Technology from one mode of transportation used to be of
little interest to practitioners of any other mode. A technology historian might notice similarities among the
functions of airport beacons, lighthouses, trafﬁc lights, and railroad signals, but the specialists in each ﬁeld had
little  to  say  to  each  other.  This  is  no  longer  the  case.  Computers,  microprocessor  controls,  electronics,  GPS,
and  advanced  networking  and  radio  technologies  are  being  applied  in  all  forms  of  passenger  and  freight
transportation, from aviation to marine, highway, and rail transport. The vehicles are now considered in context
with an entire system within a particular mode, which is increasingly viewed as part of an overall transportation
environment encompassing more than one mode.
