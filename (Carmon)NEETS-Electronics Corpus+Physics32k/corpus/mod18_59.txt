Radar systems radiate each pulse at the carrier frequency during transmit time, wait for returning
echoes during listening or rest time, and then radiate a second pulse, as shown in figure 1-3. The number
of pulses radiated in one second is called the pulse-repetition frequency (prf), or the pulse-repetition rate
(prr). The time between the beginning of one pulse and the start of the next pulse is called PULSE-
REPETITION TIME (prt) and is equal to the reciprocal of prf as follows:
