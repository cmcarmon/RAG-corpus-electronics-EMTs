Lowson worked on the development of Personal Rapid Transport (PRT) systems, on the basis that it would provide people living in urban areas the freedom of movement that makes personal car ownership attractive, without many of the associated problems such as congestion, and finding parking space. In 1995, he set up Advanced Transport Systems and was its Chief Executive Officer. The company won a government grant in 2000 to create a PRT test track in Cardiff which opened in 2001, and in 2005 won a contract to build the transport system from the car parks at Heathrow Airport to the new Terminal 5. As at April 2015, the system has carried 700,000 passengers, and has twice the operating hours of Google's automated car. At the time of his death, Lowson was investigating the feasibility of a PRT system around Bristol Temple Meads railway station.
