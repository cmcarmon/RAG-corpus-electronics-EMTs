Example 1.5
Conductors are intrinsically charge neutral even if a current
exists in the conductor. If an excess charge is somehow intro-
duced into the conductor, it will redistribute itself until the
electric ﬁeld due to the excess charge is zero. For example,
suppose an excess charge is introduced into an isolated con-
ductor. Beginning with equation 1.21, substituting equation
1.8, and using Gauss’s law r  (eE) ¼ r, we can determine that
the free volume charge r must satisfy the equation (Cheng,
1989):
