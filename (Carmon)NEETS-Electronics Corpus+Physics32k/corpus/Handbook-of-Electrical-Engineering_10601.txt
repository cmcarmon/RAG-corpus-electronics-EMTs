High-Pressure Sodium. Proper luminaire design is the key to lighting efﬁciency. Newly developed luminaires
use prismatic glass reﬂectors that are especially made for high-pressure sodium lamps. In addition to achieving
maximum  light  utilization,  they  redirect  the  intense  light  source  with  excellent  light  cutoff  and  high-angle
brightness control. Luminaire manufacturers recommend aluminum reﬂectors for all general-purpose indus-
trial applications and glass-coated reﬂectors where maintenance practice is compatible with servicing glass.
