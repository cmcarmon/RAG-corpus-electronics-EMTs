A variation of scan DFT, called boundary scan, has been deﬁned for testing integrated circuits on printed
circuit  boards  (PCBs).  Advancements  in  PCB  manufacturing,  such  as  ﬁne-lead  components,  surface  mount
assembly, and multichip modules, have yielded high-density boards with fewer access points to probe individual
pins. These PCBs are difﬁcult to test. As the name implies, boundary scan imposes a design discipline for PCB
components to enable the input/output pins of the components to be connected into scan chains. As an example,
Fig. 34.20 shows a simple PCB containing two integrated circuits conﬁgured for boundary scan. Each integrated
circuit contains scan registers between its input/output pins and its core logic to enable the PCB test bus to
control and observe the behavior of individual integrated circuits [Parker, 1989].
