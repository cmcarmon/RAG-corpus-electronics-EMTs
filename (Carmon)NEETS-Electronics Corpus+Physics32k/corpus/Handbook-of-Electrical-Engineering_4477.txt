 (RHS) denotes the sources of Eqs. (44.2) or (44.3). The integrals can be readily evaluated and assembled
for the whole problem by superposition, taking account of the boundary conditions and removing the redun-
dancy at shared nodes. At interelement boundaries in a region of particular potential [reduced Eq. (44.2) or

continuous in a weak sense, that is to say the discontinuity will depend upon the mesh reﬁnement.
