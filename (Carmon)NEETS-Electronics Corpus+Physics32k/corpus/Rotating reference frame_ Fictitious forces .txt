All non-inertial reference frames exhibit fictitious forces; rotating reference frames are characterized by three:
the centrifugal force,
the Coriolis force,
and, for non-uniformly rotating reference frames,
the Euler force.
Scientists living in a rotating box can measure the speed and direction of their rotation by measuring these fictitious forces. For example, LÃ©on Foucault was able to show the Coriolis force that results from Earth's rotation using the Foucault pendulum. If Earth were to rotate many times faster, these fictitious forces could be felt by humans, as they are when on a spinning carousel.
