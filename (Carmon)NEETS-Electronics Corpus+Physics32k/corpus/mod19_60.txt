NOTE: Sometimes during artificial ventilation, air enters the stomach instead of the lungs. This 
condition is called GASTRIC DISTENTION. It can be relieved by moderate pressure exerted with a flat 
hand between the navel and rib cage. Before applying pressure, turn the victim's head to the side to 
prevent choking on stomach contents that are often brought up during the process.
