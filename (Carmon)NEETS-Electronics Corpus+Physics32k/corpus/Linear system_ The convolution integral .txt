The output of any general continuous-time linear system is related to the input by an integral which may be written over a doubly infinite range because of the causality condition:




y
(
t
)
=

∫

−
∞


t


h

t

)
x

t

)
d

t
′



{\displaystyle y(t)=\int _{-\infty }^{t}h(t,t')x(t')dt'=\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }h(t,t')x(t')dt'}

If the properties of the system do not depend on the time at which it is operated then it is said to be time-invariant and h() is a function only of the time difference τ = t-t' which is zero for τ<0 (namely t<t'). By redefinition of h() it is then possible to write the input-output relation equivalently in any of the ways,




y

t

{\displaystyle y(t)=\int _{-\infty }^{t}h(t-t')x(t')dt'=\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }h(t-t')x(t')dt'=\int _{-\infty }^{\infty }h(\tau )x(t-\tau )d\tau =\int _{0}^{\infty }h(\tau )x(t-\tau )d\tau }

Linear time-invariant systems are most commonly characterized by the Laplace transform of the impulse response function called the transfer function which is:




H
(
s
)
=

∫

0

h

t
)

d

.


{\displaystyle H(s)=\int _{0}^{\infty }h(t)e^{-st}\,dt.}

In applications this is usually a rational algebraic function of s. Because h(t) is zero for negative t, the integral may equally be written over the doubly infinite range and putting s = iω follows the formula for the frequency response function:




H
(
i
