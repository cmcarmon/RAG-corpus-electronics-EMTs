This chapter presents a very brief overview of the characteris-
tics of a transformer. The basic theory and principles of appli-
cation are introduced. A simple lumped-parameter equivalent
circuit is presented. Magnetizing current and leakage reactance
are introduced, and cooling methods are presented and com-
pared. In addition, transformer applications are presented and
discussed. The basic core and winding arrangements are also
presented. Finally, transformer sound, overcurrent, and losses/
efﬁciency are presented, and acceptance tests are outlined.
