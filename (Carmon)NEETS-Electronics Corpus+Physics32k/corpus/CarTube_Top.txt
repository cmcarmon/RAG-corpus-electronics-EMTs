Cartube is a mobility concept which combines two existing modes of transport, automated electric cars and mass transit, into a single, seamless underground road system. Cartube was unveiled on December 2, 2016 at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers by Lars Hesselgren and his research team at London-based practice PLP Architecture. According to Lars Hesselgren, Director of Research at PLP, “CarTube is a direct response to mass transit and traffic congestion in the world’s largest cities. Moving high-speed car traffic below ground will revolutionise our concept of the city, allowing our urban spaces to be designed not for cars, but for people. CarTube has the potential to be the next best thing to teleportation and will revolutionise existing cities and allow for unprecedented urban forms."
