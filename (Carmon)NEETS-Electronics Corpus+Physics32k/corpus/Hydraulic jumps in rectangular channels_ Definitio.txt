Momentum is defined as the product of mass times velocity, and like velocity, it is a vector. French Scientist and Philosopher of the early 1600s Ren√© Descartes first discovered the concept of momentum but got stuck on the amount of motion (speed) which was not being conserved. Christian Huygens, a Dutch Scientist, pointed out that the "quantity of motion" did not need to be a positive value; a negative value meant that it was moving in the opposite direction.
