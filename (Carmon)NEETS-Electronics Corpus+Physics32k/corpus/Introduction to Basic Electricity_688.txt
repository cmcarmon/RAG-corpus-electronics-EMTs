Digital	schematic	diagrams appear quite  different 
from analog schematic diagrams because of differing in-
terconnection patterns. Digital circuits tend to have many 
common	signals that occur throughout the schematic. 
This results in many long signal lines that transverse 
the length and width of the drawing. To avoid confu-
sion, it is better to label the common signals, as shown in 
 FigureÂ 5-6, rather than draw every connection as a line.
