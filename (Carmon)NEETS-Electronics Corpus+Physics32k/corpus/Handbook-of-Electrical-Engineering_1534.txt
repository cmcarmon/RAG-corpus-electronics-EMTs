1. Starting at the root node, try splitting each node into two subnodes.
2. For  each  variable  Xi,  evaluate  questions Qi1,  Qi2,  etc.  Let  Qb  denote  the  best  question  estimated  using
any one of the criteria described earlier. The best question at a node is the question that maximizes the
likelihood of the training data at that node after applying the question.
