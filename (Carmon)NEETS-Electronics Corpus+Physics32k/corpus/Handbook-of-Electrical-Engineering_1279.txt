If the data is noise-free and composed of q complex sinusoids, then the block Toeplitz-Hankel data matrix
Xfb has rank q. Various procedures for identifying the q (with q < p) complex sinusoidal signal components
when noise is present have been proposed. Two related SVD-based methods that appeared at the same time
have proven effective for this purpose and are now brieﬂy described. In each method, the forward-backward
data matrix (14.134) is ﬁrst decomposed as
