In early attempts to correlate the EEG with behavior, analog frequency analyzers were used to examine single
channels of EEG data. Although disappointing, these initial efforts did introduce the utilization of frequency
,  i.e.,  the  magnitude  square  of
analysis  to  study  gross  brain  wave  activity. Although, 
Fourier  transform,  provides  a  quantitative  measure  of  the  frequency  distribution  of  the  EEG,  it  does  so  as
mentioned above, at the expense of other details in the EEG such as the amplitude distribution, as well as the
presence of speciÔ¨Åc patterns in the EEG.
