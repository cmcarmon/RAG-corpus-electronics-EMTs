THE CYLINDER METHOD.â€”This method uses a cylinder as the basic reference for placing data 
on a hard disk. Look at figure 8-5 view A. This is a picture of a disk pack containing six hard disk 
platters. Notice that this particular disk drive uses only 10 out of the 12 available recording surfaces. If 
you imagine that you're looking down through the disk pack from above, the tracks with the same number 
on each of the 10 recording surfaces will line up. Put together, these tracks make up a cylinder. Each of 
these 10 tracks with the same number, one on each recording surface, can be read from and written to by 
one of the disk drive's 10 read/write magnetic heads that are positioned by the five access arms.
