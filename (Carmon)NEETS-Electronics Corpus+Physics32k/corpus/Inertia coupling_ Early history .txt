Inertia coupling was essentially unknown before the introduction of high-speed jet aircraft. Prior to this time, aircraft tended to be wider than long, and their mass was generally distributed closer to the center of mass. This was especially true for propeller aircraft, but equally true for early jet fighters as well. It was only when the aircraft began to sacrifice aerodynamic surface area in order to lower drag, and use longer fineness ratios that lowered supersonic drag, that the effect became obvious. In these cases the aircraft was generally much more tail-heavy, allowing its gyroscopic effect to overwhelm the small control surfaces.
Inertia coupling at Mach 3.2 killed pilot Captain Mel Apt in his first flight in the rocket-powered Bell X-2 on 27 September 1956, and had nearly killed Chuck Yeager in the X-1A three years earlier. It was also extremely obvious in the X-3 Stiletto (first flown in 1952), and flight test data on this aircraft were used to examine the problem. The first two production aircraft to overtly experience this phenomenon, the F-100 Super Sabre and F-102 Delta Dagger (both first flown in 1953), were modified to increase wing and tail areas and were fitted with augmented control systems. To enable pilot control during dynamic motion maneuvers, for instance, the tail area of the F-102A was increased 40%. In the case of the F-101 Voodoo (first flown in 1954), a stability augmentation system was retrofitted to the A models to help combat this problem. The Lockheed F-104 Starfighter (first flown in 1956) had its stabilator (horizontal tail surface) mounted atop its vertical rudder fin to reduce inertia coupling.
