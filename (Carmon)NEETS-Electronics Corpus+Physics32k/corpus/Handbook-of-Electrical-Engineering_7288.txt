GSM  is  the  European-originated  digital  TDMA  standard.  It  also  appears  in  the  sub-1-GHz  part  of  the
spectrum, with the uplink band in the 890 to 915 MHz range and the downlink band in the 935 to 960 MHz
range. However, GSM differs from IS-136 in several respects, including modulation (GSM uses GMSK), data
rate (270.83 Kbps), and channel spacing (200 kHz). GSM systems exist in many parts of the world outside of
Europe, including North America.
