Reﬂectionless Matching Condition
Now, assume e1 ¼ e2, m1 ¼ m2, and sx ¼ s
x . This is equivalent
, and sx=e1 ¼ s
x=m1
to
(i.e., sx and s
x satisfying equation 9.94 in a pairwise manner).
With b2y ¼ b1y , equation 9.101 now yields b2x ¼ b1x . Substi-
tuting into 9.104a gives the reﬂectionless condition G ¼ 0 for
all incident angles regardless of frequency v. For this case,
equations 9.100, 9.102, 9.103, and 9.104b specify the following
