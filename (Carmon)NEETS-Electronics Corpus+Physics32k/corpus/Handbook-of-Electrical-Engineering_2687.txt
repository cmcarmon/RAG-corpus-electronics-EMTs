From  the  circuit  layout,  the  actual  chip  is  fabricated.  Based  on  the  layers  in  the  layout,  various  layers  of
materials, one on top of the others, are laid down on a silicon wafer. Typically, the processing of laying down
each of these materials involves several steps, such as masking, oxide coating, lithography and etching [Mead
and Conway, 1980]. For example, as shown in Fig. 25.6(a), for fabricating an nMOS transistor, ﬁrst two masks,
n
-diffusion mask is used
one for poly and one for 
to create a layer of silicon oxide on the wafer [see Fig. 25.6(b)]. The wafer will be covered with a thin layer of
oxide in places where the transistors are supposed to be placed as opposed to a thick layer in other places. The
poly mask is used to place a layer of polysilicon on top of the oxide layer to deﬁne the gate terminals of the
n
-diffusion regions are made to form the source and drain terminals
transistor [see Fig. 25.6(c)]. Finally, the 
of the transistor [see Fig. 25.6(d)].
