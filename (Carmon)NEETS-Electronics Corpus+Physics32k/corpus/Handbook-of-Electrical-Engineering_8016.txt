m
P receives instructions, from its internal or external memory, and data, as a combination of zeros and
ones; it is this machine code instruction that controls the operation of the system. The writing of such machine
code is far too tedious. An English-like language, machine mnemonics, is used to describe each machine operation
and this is then translated to the 0’s and 1’s which are stored in the memory. For example ADD 123 may stand
for the machine code necessary to perform the addition of the number contained in memory location 123 to
the content of the computer’s arithmetic register, leaving the result in the arithmetic register. The manufacturers
