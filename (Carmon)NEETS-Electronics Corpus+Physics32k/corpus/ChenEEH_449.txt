Figure 5.6(A) contains the typical doping proﬁle under the
emitter for the transistor in Figure 5.5. Two versions are pos-
sible: constant collector doping NC , which yields a high-voltage
device, and a selectively implanted collector (SIC), which yields
a high-speed device. The transistor speed can be further in-
creased by (a) employing an epitaxial base and (b) adding a
graded Ge proﬁle. Both measures signiﬁcantly reduce the base
transit time. A further improvement is achieved by forming a
Ge step at the BE junction in Figure 5.6(B) that prevents holes
from being back-injected into the emitter and results in a ‘‘real’’
HBT. Here, the BE proﬁle can be inverted without affecting the
current gain despite a much higher base doping. The latter
allows a signiﬁcant reduction in base resistance.
