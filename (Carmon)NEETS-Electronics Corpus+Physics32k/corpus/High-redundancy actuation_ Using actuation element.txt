An important feature of the high-redundancy actuation is that the actuator elements are connected both in parallel and in series. While the parallel arrangement is commonly used, the configuration in series is rarely employed, because it is perceived to be less efficient.
However, there is one fault that is difficult to deal with in a parallel arrangement: the locking up of one actuator element. Because parallel actuator elements always have the same extension, one locked-up element can render the whole assembly useless. It is possible to mitigate this by guarding the elements against locking or by limiting the force exerted by a single element. But these measures reduce both the effectiveness of the system and introduce new points of failure.
The analysis of the serial configuration shows that it remains operational when one element is locked-up. This fact is important for the High Redundancy Actuator, as fault tolerance is required for different fault types. The goal of the HRA project is to use parallel and serial actuator elements to accommodate both the blocking and the inactivity (loss of force) of an element.
