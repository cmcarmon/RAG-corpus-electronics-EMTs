Computers are also classified by function, the most 
common function being data processing. Industry, 
business, and government use computers to maintain 
records, perform accounting tasks, keep inventory, 
and provide a wide variety of other data processing 
functions. Computers can be general purpose or spe-
cial purpose. General-purpose computers are flexible 
and can be programmed for any task. Special-purpose, 
or dedicated, computers are designed to perform a 
single task.
