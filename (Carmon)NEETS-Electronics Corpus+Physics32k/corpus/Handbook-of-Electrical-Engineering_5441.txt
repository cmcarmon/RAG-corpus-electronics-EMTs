Surge impedance loading (SIL):  The surge impedance of a transmission line is the characteristic impedance
with resistance set to zero (resistance is assumed small compared to reactance). The power that ﬂows in
a lossless transmission line terminated in a resistive load equal to the line’s surge impedance is denoted
as the surge impedance loading of the line.
