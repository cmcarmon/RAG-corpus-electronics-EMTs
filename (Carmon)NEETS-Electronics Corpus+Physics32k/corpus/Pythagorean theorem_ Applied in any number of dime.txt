This generalization holds regardless of the number of dimensions involved. The volume squared for a three-dimensional object or set can be calculated by summing the squares of the volumes of the associated three-dimensional projections onto three-dimensional subspaces. Any number of dimensions is valid for the set as long as one uses the same number of dimensions for the coordinate subspaces and projections.
It is the built-in symmetry of the Cartesian coordinate system where coordinates are orthogonal vectors of unit length in flat Euclidean space that allows this generalization to apply so broadly.
