The atr tube is usually a simpler device than a tr tube. An atr tube might use a pure inert gas, such as
argon, because recovery time generally is not a vital factor. Furthermore, a priming agent, such as keep-
alive voltage, is not needed. The absence of either a chemically active gas or a keep-alive voltage results
in atr tubes having longer useful lives than tr tubes.
