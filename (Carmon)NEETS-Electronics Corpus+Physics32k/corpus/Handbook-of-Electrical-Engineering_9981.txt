Although Eqs. (100.102) and (100.103) are an obvious approach to evaluating the fundamental output of a
nonlinearity, they are indirect, because one must ﬁrst determine the output wave form y(q) from the known
nonlinear  characteristic  and  sinusoidal  input  wave  form.  This  is  avoided  if  the  substitution q =cos–1(x/a)  is
made. After some simple manipulations,
