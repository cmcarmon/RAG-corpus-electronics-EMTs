If a liquid is contained in a cylindrical vessel and is rotating around a vertical axis coinciding with the axis of the cylinder, the free surface will assume a parabolic surface of revolution known as a paraboloid. The free surface at each point is at a right angle to the force acting at it, which is the resultant of the force of gravity and the centrifugal force from the motion of each point in a circle. Since the main mirror in a telescope must be parabolic, this principle is used to create liquid mirror telescopes.
Consider a cylindrical container filled with liquid rotating in the z direction in cylindrical coordinates, the equations of motion are:

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial P}{\partial r}}=\rho r\omega ^{2},\;\;\;{\frac {\partial P}{\partial \theta }}=0,\;\;\;{\frac {\partial P}{\partial z}}=-\rho g}

Where



ρ


{\displaystyle \rho }
is the density of the fluid,



r


{\displaystyle r}
is the radius of the cylinder,



ω


{\displaystyle \omega }
is the angular frequency and



g


{\displaystyle g}
is the gravitational acceleration. Taking a surface of constant pressure

If one integrates the volume of the paraboloid formed by the free surface and then solves for the original height, one can find the height of the fluid along the centerline of the cylindrical container:

If a free liquid is rotating about an axis, the free surface will take the shape of an oblate spheroid: the approximate shape of the Earth due to its equatorial bulge.
