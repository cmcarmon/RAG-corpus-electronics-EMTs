Figure 5.30 shows a typical output  characteristic
(ID plotted against VDS) for a small-signal general- 
purpose  N-channel  JFET  operating  in  common- 
source  mode  (see  Chapter  7).  This  characteristic 
comprises  a  family  of  curves,  each  relating  to  a 
different  value  of  gate-source  voltage  (VGS).  It  is 
worth  taking  a  little  time  to  get  familiar  with  this 
characteristic  as  we  shall  be  using  it  again  in 
Chapter  7  (you  might  also  like  to  compare  this 
characteristic  with  the  output  characteristic  for  a 
transistor  operating  in  common-emitter  mode  (see 
Fig. 5.22). 
  Once  again,  the  characteristic  curves  have  a 
‘knee’ that occurs at low values of VDS. Also, note 
how  the  curves  become  flattened  above  this  value 
with  the  drain  current  (ID) not  changing  very 
greatly  for  a  comparatively  large  change  in  drain-
source  voltage  (VDS).  These  characteristics  are,  in 
fact, even flatter than those for a bipolar transistor. 
Because  of  their  flatness,  they  are  often  said  to 
represent a constant current characteristic.
