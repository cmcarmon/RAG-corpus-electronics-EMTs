Slater’s result suggested that, of these metals, iron, cobalt, nickel, and gadolinium should be ferromagnetic
at room temperature, while chromium and manganese should not be ferromagnetic. This is in accordance with
experiment. Gadolinium, one of the rare earth elements, is only weakly ferromagnetic in a cool room. Chro-
mium and manganese in the elemental form narrowly miss being ferromagnetic. However, when manganese
is alloyed with copper and aluminum (Cu61Mn24Al15) to form what is known as a Heusler alloy [Crangle, 1962],
it  becomes  ferromagnetic.  The  radius  of  the  3d  electrons  has  not  been  changed  by  alloying,  but  the  atomic
spacing  has  been  increased  by  a  factor  of  1.53/1.47.  This  small  change  is  sufﬁcient  to  make  the  difference
between positive exchange, parallel spins, and ferromagnetism and negative exchange, antiparallel spins, and
antiferromagnetism.
