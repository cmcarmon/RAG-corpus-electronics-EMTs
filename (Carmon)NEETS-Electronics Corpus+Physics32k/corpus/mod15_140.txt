A control synchro system consisting of a control transmitter and a control transformer is illustrated in 
figure 1-25. The stator windings of the CX are connected to the stator windings of the CT and both 
synchros are shown on 0ยบ. Notice, that at 0ยบ, the CT rotor is perpendicular to its S2 winding. This is 
contrary to what we have learned so far about synchros, but it is just another peculiarity of the CT. When 
the rotor of the CX is on 0ยบ, the rotor's magnetic field points straight up as shown (the black arrow). The 
voltages induced in the CX stator windings, as a result of this field, are impressed on the CT stator 
windings through the three leads connecting the S1, S2, and S3 terminals. Exciting currents proportional 
to these voltages flow in the CT stator windings and establish a magnetic field in the CT in the same 
direction (white arrow) as the magnetic field (black arrow) in the CX. Observe that the rotor of the CT is 
perpendicular to the stator magnetic field and, therefore, the induced voltage in the rotor is zero, as 
indicated by the straight line on the oscilloscope presentation.
