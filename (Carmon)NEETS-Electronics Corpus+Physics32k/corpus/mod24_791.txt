A ring topology consists of equipments attached to one another in a closed loop or ring (see figure
8-3). The connection between each equipment is a simple point-to-point link. In some systems each
equipment may have an associated optical switch. In normal operation, the switch routes signals from the
fiber connected to the previous equipment to the receiver. It also routes signals from the transmitter to the
fiber connected to the next equipment. In bypass operation, the switch routes signals from the fiber
connected to the previous equipment to the fiber connected to the next equipment. In each case, the
connection between adjacent equipments on the ring is a simple point-to-point link through fiber,
connectors, and switches.
