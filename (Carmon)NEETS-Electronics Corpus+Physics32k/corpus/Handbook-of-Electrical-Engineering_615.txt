Elements of Chaotic Digital Communications Systems
In a digital communications system, the symbol to be transmitted is mapped by the modulator to an analog
sample function and this analog signal passes through an analog channel. The analog signal in the channel is
subject to a number of disturbing inﬂuences, including attenuation, bandpass ﬁltering, and additive noise. The
role  of  the  demodulator  is  to  decide,  on  the  basis  of  the  received  corrupted  sample  function,  which  symbol
was transmitted.
