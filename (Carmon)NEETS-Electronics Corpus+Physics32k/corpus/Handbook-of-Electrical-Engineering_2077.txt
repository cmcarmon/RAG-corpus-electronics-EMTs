Received active sonar signals can be viewed as consisting of the results of a deterministic component (known
transmit waveform) convolved with the medium and reﬂector transfer functions and a random (noise) component.
Moreover, the Doppler imparted (frequency shift) to the reﬂected signal makes the total system effect nonlinear,
thereby complicating analysis and processing of these signals.
