Obviously, the circle of a given diameter has less cross-sectional area than a square of
width and height equal to the circle’s diameter: both units of area measurement reﬂect that.
However, it should be clear that the unit of ”square mil” is really tailored for the convenient
determination of a square’s area, while ”circular mil” is tailored for the convenient determi-
nation of a circle’s area: the respective formula for each is simpler to work with. It must be
understood that both units are valid for measuring the area of a shape, no matter what shape
that may be. The conversion between circular mils and square mils is a simple ratio: there are
π (3.1415927 . . .) square mils to every 4 circular mils.
