As with tunnel-diode amplifiers, the circulator improves stability by preventing reflection of the 
signal back into the amplifier. Reflections would be amplified and cause uncontrollable oscillations. The 
ferrite circulator also serves as an isolator to prevent source and load impedance changes from affecting 
gain.
