Cut-Set and Retiming
The primary methods of SFG optimization employed are cut-
set and retiming (Kung, 1988). The objective is to convert an
SFG into a fully pipelined form so that all the edges between
modular sections have at least one delay element. A cut-set is a
minimal set of edges including the target edge, non-zero-delay
edges going in either direction, and zero-delay edges going in
the same direction as the target edge. The procedure consists of
these three steps:
