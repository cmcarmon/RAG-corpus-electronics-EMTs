In string theory, it indicates a phase transition: the transition at which very long strings are copiously produced. It is controlled by the size of the string tension, which is smaller than the Planck scale by the some power of the coupling constant. By adjusting the tension to be small compared to the Planck scale, the Hagedorn transition can be much less than the Planck temperature. Traditional grand-unified string models place this in the magnitude of 1030 kelvin, two orders of magnitude smaller than the Planck temperature. Such temperatures have not been reached in any experiment and are beyond the reach of current, or even foreseeable technology.
