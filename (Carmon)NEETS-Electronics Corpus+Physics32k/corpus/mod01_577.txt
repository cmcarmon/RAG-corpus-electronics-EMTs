Notice that the sum of the ohmic values in each circuit shown in figure 3-41 is equal (30 ohms), and
that the applied voltage is the same (50 volts). However, the total current in 3-41(B) (15 amps) is twice
the amount in 3-41(A) (7.5 amps). It is apparent, therefore, that the manner in which resistors are
connected in a circuit, as well as their actual ohmic values, affect the total current.
