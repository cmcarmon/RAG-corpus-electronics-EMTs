Electromagnetics-Based Sensors
Smart electromagnetic sensors are simple deviations of classic electric/magnetic probes, more properly known
as antennas or pickups. Depending on changes in the surroundings vis-à-vis the electromagnetic characteristics,
these  sensors  respond  and  yield  a  corresponding  signal.  Again,  the  environmental  changes  refer  to  possible
alterations caused by elastic, thermal, optical, magnetic, electric, and/or chemical inﬂuences.
