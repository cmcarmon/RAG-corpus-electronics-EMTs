Thermal imaging cameras, such as the Raytheon AN/AAQ-26, are used in a variety of applications, including naval vessels, fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and armored fighting vehicles.
In warfare, they have three distinct advantages over other imaging technologies.
First, the imager itself is nearly impossible for the enemy to detect, as it detects energy emitted from the target rather than sending out energy that is reflected from the target, as with radar or sonar.
Second, it sees radiation in the infrared light spectrum, which is difficult to camouflage.
Third, these camera systems can see through smoke, fog, haze, and other atmospheric obscurants better than a visible light camera can.
