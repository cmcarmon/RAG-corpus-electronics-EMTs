The accident site was located on the main line of the Erie Division at a point 2.4 miles east of Conneaut and 1861 feet from the Ohio - Pennsylvania state line. This was on the famous "Water Level Route," a four track mainline where fast passenger trains from the Midwest ran on an almost grade less route to New York. The main tracks here, from south to north, were designated as No. 4, eastward freight; No. 2, eastward passenger; No. 1, westward passenger; and No. 3, westward freight. The grade is practically level and it was raining at the time of the accident. The distance between the center-lines of adjacent tracks was 13 feet.
