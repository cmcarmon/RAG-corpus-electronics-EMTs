50 V, at which the drain current abruptly increases and may damage the MOSFET due to heat if
operation is continued. The gate breakdown voltage, at about 50 V, may also cause a sudden and
permanent rupture of the oxide layer.
ohmic region where vGS > VT and vDS < vGS âˆ’ VT , the drain current is given by
