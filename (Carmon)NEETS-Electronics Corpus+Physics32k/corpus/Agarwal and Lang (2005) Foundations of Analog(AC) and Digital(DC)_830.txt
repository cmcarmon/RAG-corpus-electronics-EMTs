11. Notice that if both switches are off, the voltage at the node connecting M1 and M2 appears to
be undefined. Therefore vGS for M1 also appears to be undefined. In practice, however, MOSFET
switches are not perfect open circuits, rather they have a very high resistance between their drain
and source in the off state. Thus, the voltage between M1 and M2 will be given by a voltage divider
relationship. In any case, vGS for M1 will not impact the output voltage of the gate.
