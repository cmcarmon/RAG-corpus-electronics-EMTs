This equation is plotted in Fig. 2.9(b) and approximates that of the actual battery. The equation gives a straight
line with slope –RS that intersects the v axis (i = 0) at v = V S. The resistance RS is said to be the internal resistance
of this nonideal source model. It is a ﬁctitious resistance but the model nevertheless gives an equivalent terminal
behavior.
