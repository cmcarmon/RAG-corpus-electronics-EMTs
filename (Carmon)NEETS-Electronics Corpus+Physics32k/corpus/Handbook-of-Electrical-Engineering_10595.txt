Ballasts
Fluorescent.  Electronic ballasts are now available for the F40T12, the slimline, the new T8 lamps, and other
energy-saving ﬂuorescent lamps on both 120- and 277-V circuits. Using high-frequency ballasts, the efﬁcacy
can  be  raised  by  nearly  12%.  Although  electronic  ballasts  cost  more  than  the  standard  core-coil  ballasts,
operating factors should reﬂect an appreciable reduction in life-cycle cost for a lighting system. There are two
types of dimming ballasts: core and electronic. High-frequency ballasts can readily be used to dim ﬂuorescent
lamps over a wide range of light level. All external control wiring is low voltage or ﬁber-optic wiring.
