The cathode to anode potential and the magnetic field strength determine the amount of time for 
electron Q2 to travel from a position in front of cavity B to a position in front of cavity C. Cavity C is 
equal to approximately 1/2 cycle of the rf oscillations of the cavities. When electron Q2 reaches a position 
in front of cavity C, the ac field of cavity C is reversed from that shown. Therefore, electron Q2 gives up 
energy to the ac field of cavity C and slows down even more. Electron Q2 actually gives up energy to 
each cavity as it passes and eventually reaches the anode when its energy is expended. Thus, electron Q2 
has helped sustain oscillations because it has taken energy from the dc field and given it to the ac field. 
Electron Q1, which took energy from the ac field around cavity A, did little harm because it immediately 
returned to the cathode.
