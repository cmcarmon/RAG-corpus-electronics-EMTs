Single-stage astable oscillator 
 
A simple form of astable oscillator that produces a 
square  wave  output  can  be  built  using  just  one 
operational  amplifier,  as  shown  in  Fig.  9.10.  The 
circuit  employs  positive  feedback  with  the  output 
fed back to the non-inverting input via the potential 
divider  formed  by  R1 and  R2.  This  circuit  can 
make  a  very  simple  square  wave  source  with  a
