It is therefore important to ensure that the interleaving of the execution of transactions leaves the database
in  a  consistent  state.  One  way  of  preserving  data  consistency  is  to  ensure  that  the  interleaved  execution  of
transactions  is  equivalent  to  their  serial  execution.  This  is  referred  to  as serializable  execution.  Therefore,  an
interleaved execution of transactions is said to be serializable if it is equivalent to a serial execution.
