(2.173)
where g is a constant coefficient. When the dependent source is a voltage-
controlled current source, the coefficient g is called the transconductance with
units of conductance. Notice that Equation 2.173 is the element law for our
dependent source expressed as usual in terms of the branch variables. We also
need to summarize the behavior of the input port to completely characterize
the dependent source. Since our idealized VCCS does not require any power
to be supplied at its input, the element law for the input port is simply
