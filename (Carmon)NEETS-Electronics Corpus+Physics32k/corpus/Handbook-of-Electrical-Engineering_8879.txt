Figure 88.5 shows the structure of a simple interleaved memory system. m address bits are simultaneously
supplied to every memory bank. All banks are also connected to the same read/write control line (not shown
in Fig. 88.5). For a read operation, the banks start the read operation and deposit the data in their latches. Data
can then be read from the latches, one by one, by setting the switch appropriately. Meanwhile, the banks could
be accessed again, to carry out another read or write operation. For a write operation, the latches are loaded,
one by one. When all the latches have been written, their contents can be written into the memory banks by
supplying m bits of address (they will be written into the same word in each of the different banks). In a simple
interleaved  memory,  all  banks  are  cycled  at  the  same  time;  each  bank  starts  and  completes  its  individual
operations at the same time as every other bank; a new memory cycle can start (for all banks) once the previous
cycle is complete. Timing details of the accesses can be found in The Architecture of Pipelined Computers, [Kogge,
1981].
