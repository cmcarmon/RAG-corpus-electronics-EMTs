Both the rigid gravity well and the rubber-sheet model are frequently misidentified as models of general relativity due to an accidental resemblance to general relativistic embedding diagrams, and perhaps Einstein's employment of gravitational "curvature" bending the path of light he described as a prediction of general relativity. The embedding diagram most commonly found in textbooks, an isometric embedding of a constant-time equatorial slice of the Schwarzschild metric in Euclidean 3-dimensional space, superficially resembles a gravity well. However, embedding diagrams fundamentally differ from gravity wells.
Embedding takes merely a shape, but a potential plot has a distinguished "downward" direction. Turning a gravity well "upside down" by negating the potential of the attractive force, turns it into a repulsive force. However, turning a Schwarzschild embedding upside down, by rotating it, has no effect, since it leaves its intrinsic geometry unchanged. Also, geodesics following across the Schwarzschild surface would bend toward the central mass like a ball rolling in a gravity well, but for entirely different reasons. There is no analogy of the Schwarzschild embedding for a repulsive field though such a field is modeled in general relativity, the spatial geometry cannot be embedded in three dimensions.
The Schwarzschild embedding is commonly drawn with a hyperbolic cross section like the potential well, but in fact it has a parabolic cross section which, unlike the gravity well, does not approach a planar asymptote. See Flamm's paraboloid.
