If the load on the motor is increased, the motor tends to slow down. When this happens, the counter 
emf generated in the armature decreases. This causes a corresponding decrease in the opposition to 
battery current flow through the armature. Armature current increases, causing the motor to speed up. The 
conditions that established the original speed are reestablished, and the original speed is maintained.
