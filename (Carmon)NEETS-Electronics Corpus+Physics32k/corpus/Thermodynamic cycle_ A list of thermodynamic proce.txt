Adiabatic : No energy transfer as heat (Q) during that part of the cycle would amount to δQ=0. This does not exclude energy transfer as work.
Isothermal : The process is at a constant temperature during that part of the cycle (T=constant, δT=0). This does not exclude energy transfer as heat or work.
Isobaric : Pressure in that part of the cycle will remain constant. (P=constant, δP=0). This does not exclude energy transfer as heat or work.
Isochoric : The process is constant volume (V=constant, δV=0). This does not exclude energy transfer as heat or work.
Isentropic : The process is one of constant entropy (S=constant, δS=0). This excludes the transfer of heat but not work.
Isenthalpic: process that proceeds without any change in enthalpy or specific enthalpy
Polytropic: process that obeys the relation:
