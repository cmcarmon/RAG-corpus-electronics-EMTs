In addition to the dc term and the second harmonics of the two frequencies, there are additional terms at
the sum and difference frequencies, f1 + f2, f1 – f2, which are the beat frequencies. The second-order intermod-
ulation  distortion  (IM2)  is  deﬁned  as  the  ratio  of  the  amplitude  at  a  beat  frequency  to  the  amplitude  of  the
fundamental component.
