17 Perhaps more accurately, assuming that states represent acoustic phenom-
ena seems to provide a good rule of thumb for creating HMMs with successful
performance. However, the relationship of the number of states to the per-
formance of the HMM is very imprecise, and in practice, it is often necessary to
experiment with different model sizes.
