Applying Back-Propagation in Practice
Now  that  we  know  an  algorithm  to  train  MLPs,  let  us  see  what  are  the  practical  issues  to  apply  it.  We  will
address the following aspects: size of training set vs. weights, search procedures, how to stop training, and how
to set the topology for maximum generalization.
