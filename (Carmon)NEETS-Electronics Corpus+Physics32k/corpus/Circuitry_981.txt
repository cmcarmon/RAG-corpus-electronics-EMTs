Boolean algebra 
 
Boolean  algebra  is  the  algebra  that  we  use  to 
describe  and  simplify 
logic  expressions.  An 
understanding of Boolean algebra can be extremely 
useful  when 
that 
employs digital logic. It is, for example, very useful 
to  be  able  to  predict  the  output  of  a  logic  circuit 
when a particular input condition is present. 
 
Boolean notation 
 
Just as with conventional algebra, we use letters to 
represent  the  variables  in  these  expressions.  The
