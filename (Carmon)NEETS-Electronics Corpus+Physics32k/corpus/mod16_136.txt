Normally, on steel-hull vessels, such grounds are inherently provided because the metal cases or
frames of the equipment are in contact with one another and with the metal structure of the vessel. In
some instances where such inherent grounding is not provided by the mounting arrangements, such as
equipment supported on shock mounts, suitable ground connections must be provided.
