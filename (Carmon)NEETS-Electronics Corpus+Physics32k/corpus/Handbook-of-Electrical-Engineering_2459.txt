At VGS = 0, IDS = IDSS. This equation and the corresponding transfer curve can actually
be extended up to the point where VGS @ +0.5 V. In the region where 0 < VGS < +0.5 V,
the  gate-to-channel  pn  junction  is  forward-biased  and  the  depletion  region  width  is
reduced below the width under zero bias conditions. This reduction in the depletion
region width leads to a corresponding expansion of the conducting channel and thus
an increase in IDS above IDSS. As long as the gate-to-channel forward bias voltage is less
than about 0.5 V, the pn junction will be essentially “off ” and very little gate current
will  ﬂow.  If  VGS  is  increased  much  above  +0.5  V,  however,  the  gate-to-channel  pn
junction will turn “on” and there will be a substantial ﬂow of gate voltage IG . This gate
current will load down the signal source and produce a voltage drop across the signal
source resistance, as shown in Fig. 24.12. This voltage drop can cause VGS to be much
smaller than the signal source voltage Vin. As Vin increases, VGS will ultimately level off at a forward bias voltage
of about +0.7 V, and the signal source will lose control over VGS , and hence over IDS. This can result in severe
distortion of the input signal in the form of clipping, and thus this situation should be avoided. Thus, although
it is possible to increase IDS above IDSS by allowing the gate-to-channel junction to become forward-biased by
a  small  amount  (£0.5 V),  the  possible  beneﬁts  are  generally  far  outweighed  by  the  risk  of  signal  distortion.
Therefore, JFETs are almost always operated with the gate-to-channel pn junction reverse-biased.
