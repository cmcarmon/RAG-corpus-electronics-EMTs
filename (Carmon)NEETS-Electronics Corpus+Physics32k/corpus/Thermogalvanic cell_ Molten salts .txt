In this type of thermocell the electrolyte is some kind of salt with a relatively low melting point. Their use solve two problems. On one hand the temperature range of the cell is much larger. This is an advantage as these cells produce more power the larger the difference between the hot and cold sides. On the other hand, the liquid salt directly provides the anions and cations necessary for sustainment of a current through the cell. Therefore, no additional current-carrying compounds are necessary as the melted salt is the electrolyte itself. Typical hot source temperatures are between 600-900 K, but can get as high as 1730 K. Cold sink temperatures are in the 400-500 K range.
