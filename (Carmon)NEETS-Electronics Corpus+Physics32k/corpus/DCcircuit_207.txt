We can trace the direction that electrons will ï¬‚ow in the same circuit by starting at the negative
(-) terminal and following through to the positive (+) terminal of the battery, the only source of
voltage in the circuit. From this we can see that the electrons are moving counter-clockwise,
from point 6 to 5 to 4 to 3 to 2 to 1 and back to 6 again.
