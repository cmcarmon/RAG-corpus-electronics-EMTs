Fiber optic connector coupling loss results from the same loss mechanisms described earlier in this
chapter. Coupling loss results from poor fiber alignment and end preparation (extrinsic losses), fiber
mismatches (intrinsic loss), and Fresnel reflection. The total amount of insertion loss for fiber optic
connectors should remain below 1 dB. Fiber alignment is the critical parameter in maintaining the total
insertion loss below the required level. There is only a small amount of control over coupling loss
resulting from fiber mismatches, because the loss results from inherent fiber properties. Index matching
gels cannot be used to reduce Fresnel losses, since the index matching gels attract dust and dirt to the
connection.
