Another important issue in this ultrahigh frequency (UHF) environment is that radio frequency (RF) energy
at  these  frequencies  tends  to  propagate  through  and  around  obstacles,  reaching  beyond  the  conﬁnes  of  the
network it is serving. That property makes this RF band suitable for receiving commercial broadcast signals
from  distant  stations  through  the  walls  of  buildings  to  receivers  inside.  It  also  makes  it  suitable  for  mobile
cellular telephones, but it cannot be well contained within the conﬁnes of the microcell described earlier, which
limits  spectrum  reuse  and  overall  network  capacity  requirements  absolutely  essential  in  a  viable  wireless
network communications system. Current UHF spread spectrum wireless in-building communications systems,
then, suffer from critical bandwidth and spectrum reuse shortcomings that seem likely to prevent them from
expanding beyond limited applications.
