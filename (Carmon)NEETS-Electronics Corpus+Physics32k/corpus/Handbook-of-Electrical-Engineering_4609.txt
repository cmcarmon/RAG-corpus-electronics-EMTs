If certain materials get cold enough, their resistivity goes to zeroâ€”not to some very small value but, as nearly
  has  been  known  as  an  interesting  phenomenon  for  many  years,  but
as  we  can  tell,  zero. 
applications have been limited because the phenomenon only occurred at temperatures within a few degrees
of absolute zero. Recent advances, however, have produced materials which exhibit superconductive behavior
at substantially higher temperatures, and there is renewed interest in developing applications. This is certainly
an area to watch in the next few years.
