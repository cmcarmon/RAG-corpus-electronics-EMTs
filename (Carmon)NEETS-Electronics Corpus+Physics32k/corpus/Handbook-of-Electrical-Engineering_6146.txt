Many good “front end” programs are now available which allow the user to quickly write an analysis program
and utilize the built in IO features of the package. There are also several good general mathematical packages
available.  Much  research  work  can  now  be  done  using  tools  such  as  these.  The  researcher  is  freed  from  the
chore of developing algorithms and IO routines by using these standard packages. Not only that, extra software
is being developed which can turn these general packages into specialist packages. It may well be that before
long all software will be made to run on sophisticated developments of these types of package and the stand
alone program will fall into oblivion.
