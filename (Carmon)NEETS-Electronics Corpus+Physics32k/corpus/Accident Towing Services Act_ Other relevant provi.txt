VicRoads is empowered under the Act to attach conditions to the tow truck licences it issues. Breach of a condition is an offence. A tow truck licence is specified to be the property of the holder of the licence. Despite this, licence holders are prohibited from assigning or renting the licence to another person. Licences are, however, able to be transferred to other persons whereupon special procedural requirements apply.
The Act provides capacity for VicRoads to cancel or suspend tow truck licences if operators fail to comply with licence conditions or do not comply with a provision of the Act or other relevant Acts such as the Road Safety Act 1986.
