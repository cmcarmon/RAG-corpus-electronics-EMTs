One of the most important results in the analysis of signals is the sampling theorem, which
is formally presented later. Many modern signal-processing techniques and the whole family
of digital communication methods are based on the validity of this theorem and the insight it
provides. The idea leading to the sampling theorem is rather simple and quite intuitive. Let us
consider a relatively smooth signal x1(t), which varies slowly and has its main frequency content
at low frequencies, as well as a rapidly changing signal x2(t) due to the presence of high-frequency
components. Suppose we are to approximate these signals with samples taken at regular intervals,
so that linear interpolation of the sampled values can be used to obtain an approximation of the
original signals. It is obvious that the sampling interval for the signal x1(t) can be much larger
than the sampling interval necessary to reconstruct signal x2(t) with comparable distortion. This
is simply a direct consequence of the smoothness of the signal x1(t) compared to x2(t). Therefore,
the sampling interval for the signals of smaller bandwidths can be made larger, or the sampling
frequency can be made smaller. The sampling theorem is, in fact, a statement of this intuitive
reasoning.
