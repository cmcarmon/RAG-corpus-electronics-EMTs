The first restriction on the geometry of a moduli space was found in 1979 by Bruno Zumino and published in the article Supersymmetry and K채hler Manifolds. He considered an N=1 theory in 4-dimensions with global supersymmetry. N=1 means that the fermionic components of the supersymmetry algebra can be assembled into a single Majorana supercharge. The only scalars in such a theory are the complex scalars of the chiral superfields. He found that the vacuum manifold of allowed vacuum expectation values for these scalars is not only complex but also a K채hler manifold.
If gravity is included in the theory, so that there is local supersymmetry, then the resulting theory is called a supergravity theory and the restriction on the geometry of the moduli space becomes stronger. The moduli space must not only be K채hler, but also the K채hler form must lift to integral cohomology. Such manifolds are called Hodge manifolds. The first example appeared in the 1979 article Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and Higgs Effect in Supergravity Without Cosmological Constant and the general statement appeared 3 years later in Quantization of Newton's Constant in Certain Supergravity Theories.
