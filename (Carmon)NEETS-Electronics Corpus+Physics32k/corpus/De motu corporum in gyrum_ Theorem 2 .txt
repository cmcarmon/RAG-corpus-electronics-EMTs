Theorem 2 considers a body moving uniformly in a circular orbit, and shows that for any given time-segment, the centripetal force (directed towards the center of the circle, treated here as a center of attraction) is proportional to the square of the arc-length traversed, and inversely proportional to the radius. (This subject reappears as Proposition 4, Theorem 4 in the Principia, and the corollaries here reappear also.)
Corollary 1 then points out that the centripetal force is proportional to V2/R, where V is the orbital speed and R the circular radius.
Corollary 2 shows that, putting this in another way, the centripetal force is proportional to (1/P2) * R where P is the orbital period.
Corollary 3 shows that if P2 is proportional to R, then the centripetal force would be independent of R.
Corollary 4 shows that if P2 is proportional to R2, then the centripetal force would be proportional to 1/R.
Corollary 5 shows that if P2 is proportional to R3, then the centripetal force would be proportional to 1/(R2).
A scholium then points out that the Corollary 5 relation (square of orbital period proportional to cube of orbital size) is observed to apply to the planets in their orbits around the Sun, and to the Galilean satellites orbiting Jupiter.
