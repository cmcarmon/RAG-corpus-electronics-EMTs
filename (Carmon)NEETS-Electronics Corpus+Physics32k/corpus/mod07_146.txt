In addition to their use as simple rectifiers, diodes are also used in circuits that mix signals together
(mixers), detect the presence of a signal (detector), and act as a switch "to open or close a circuit." Diodes
used in these applications are commonly referred to as "signal diodes." The simplest application of a
signal diode is the basic diode switch shown in figure 1-24.
