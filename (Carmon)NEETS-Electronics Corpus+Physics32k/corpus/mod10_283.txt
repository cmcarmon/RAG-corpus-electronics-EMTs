The ionosphere is composed of three layers designated D, E, and F, from lowest level to highest 
level as shown in figure 2-14. The F layer is further divided into two layers designated F1 (the lower 
layer) and F2 (the higher layer). The presence or absence of these layers in the ionosphere and their height 
above the Earth varies with the position of the sun. At high noon, radiation in the ionosphere directly 
above a given point is greatest. At night it is minimum. When the radiation is removed, many of the 
particles that were ionized recombine. The time interval between these conditions finds the position and 
number of the ionized layers within the ionosphere changing. Since the position of the sun varies daily, 
monthly, and yearly, with respect to a specified point on Earth, the exact position and number of layers 
present are extremely difficult to determine. However, the following general statements can be made:
