Another very useful analysis is the time response of nonlinear
circuits. This requires the solution of the differential equation
3.6, and once again numerical methods are used. Usually the
solution of the network at time t ¼ 0 is known, and the
response is calculated after a time step of h at t þ h. All
numerical solution methods replace the time derivative in
equation 3.6 with a suitable approximation, and then the
resulting equations are solved. Expanding the solution in a
Taylor series, the following is obtained:
