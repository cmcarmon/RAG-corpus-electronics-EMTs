Though many problems can be located using just 
a multimeter, an oscilloscope (Figure 50-4) is es-
sential for advanced troubleshooting. The basic os-
cilloscope requirement is a dual trace, 10â€“20 MHz 
minimum vertical; a delayed sweep is desirable but not 
essential. A good set of proper 10X/1X probes is also 
necessary. A storage scope or digital scope might be 
desirable for certain tasks but is not essential for basic 
troubleshooting.
