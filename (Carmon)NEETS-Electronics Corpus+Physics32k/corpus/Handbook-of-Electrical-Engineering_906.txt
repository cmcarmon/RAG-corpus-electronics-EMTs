Numerical Method
In a transient analysis time is discretized into intervals called time steps. Typically the time steps are of unequal
length, with the smallest steps being taken during portions of the analysis when the circuit voltages and currents
are changing most rapidly. The capacitors and inductors in the circuit are then replaced by voltage and current
sources based on the following procedure.
