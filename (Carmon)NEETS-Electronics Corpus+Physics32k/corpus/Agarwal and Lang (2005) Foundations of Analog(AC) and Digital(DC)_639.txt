The values of ID and iD immediately confirm that iD is the sum of a DC
term and a small time-varying sinusoidal term. Observe further the ease with
which we obtained the form of iD, and contrast with the uninsightful expression
in Equation 4.53 that resulted from the brute-force analytical approach.
