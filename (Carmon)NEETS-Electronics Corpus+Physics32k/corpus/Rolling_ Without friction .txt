Suppose that a rolling body is moving uphill, i.e., instead of moving down, a body strikes the base of the inclined plane, naturally, the energy carried by the body shall make it rise up to a certain height. Consider the height as h. Let the body have velocity v, accelerating at a and be of mass m. Acceleration due to gravity is g. The angle of inclination is θ.
So, the hypotenuse (see figure) becomes



h
⋅
cosec
⁡
θ


{\displaystyle h\cdot \operatorname {cosec} \theta }
.
Now, to rise up to height h, the body must carry sufficient kinetic energy in order to work against gravity and work to move uphill. Therefore, we have:






energy



body



=



work



against gravity


+


work


moving uphill




{\displaystyle {\text{energy}}_{\textrm {body}}={\textrm {work}}_{\text{against gravity}}+{\text{work}}_{\text{moving uphill}}}
