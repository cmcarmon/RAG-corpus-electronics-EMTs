Coordinates are usually right-handed.
For right-handed coordinates your right thumb points along the Z axis in a positive Z-direction and the curl of your fingers represents a motion from the first or X axis to the second or Y axis. When viewed from the top or Z axis the system is counter-clockwise.
For left-handed coordinates your left thumb points along the Z axis in a positive Z-direction and the curled fingers of your left hand represent a motion from the first or X axis to the second or Y axis. When viewed from the top or Z axis the system is clockwise.
Interchanging the labels of any two axes reverses the handedness. Reversing the direction of one axis (or of all three axes) also reverses the handedness. (If the axes do not have a positive or negative direction then handedness has no meaning.) Reversing two axes amounts to a 180Â° rotation around the remaining axis.
Note that the convention of assigning the index finger to the first axis (rather than the thumb) corresponds with the convention of finger-counting of the United Kingdom and United States, whereas for Continental Europeans, the thumb represents the first digit to be counted; the "natural" assignment of fingers to axes that leads to a "right"-handed rule would likewise differ in many other cultures.
