Objectives 3 and 4 may be analyzed by frequency domain methods (Section 100.3). Time-domain measures
classically  analyze  the  dynamic  response  by  partitioning  the  total  response  into  its  steady-state  (objective  2)
and transient (objective 1) components. The steady-state response is that part of the response which remains
as  time  approaches  inﬁnity;  the  transient  response  is  that  part  of  the  response  which  vanishes  as  time
approaches inﬁnity.
