4.2.2 A signal’s spectrum
The Fourier series expression of (4.2) has a very deep interpretation. The time-domain signal s(t) is there
expressed as a weighted sum of complex exponentials that diﬀer only in their frequency k/T . In this way,
we have a frequency-domain representation of the signal. The “deep” part is that either representation can
be used to characterize a signal: we can specify a signal in the time-domain or in the frequency domain.
Because of the Fourier series, we can ﬁnd how to represent the signal in the “other” domain. How the Fourier
