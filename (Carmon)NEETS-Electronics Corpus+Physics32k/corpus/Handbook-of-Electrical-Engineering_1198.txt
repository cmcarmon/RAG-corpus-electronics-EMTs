A solution to the general signal restoration problem for the case in which the individual attribute sets are
closed subspaces formally entails determining the orthogonal projection operator PC on the closed composite
attribute subspace (14.81). Unfortunately, an analytical expression for PC is typically intractable even when the
orthogonal projection operators Pk deÔ¨Åned on each of the individual attribute subspaces Ck are readily con-
structed. The natural question arises as to whether it is possible to use these individual orthogonal projection
operators  to  generate  PC .  In  recognition  of  this  need,  J.  von  Neumann  developed  a  method  for  iteratively
constructing the required projection operator [von Neumann, 1950] for the case of two (m = 2) closed subspaces
(p.  55,  theorem  14.7).  This  result  was  later  extended  by  Halperin  [1962]  for  the  multiple  attribute  closed
subspace case as described in the following theorem.
