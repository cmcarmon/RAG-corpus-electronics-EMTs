To track an object with cw Doppler, you must determine the radar range. Since the Doppler
frequency is not directly related to range, another method is needed to determine object range. By using
two separate transmitters that operate at two different frequencies (f1 and f 2), you can determine range by
measuring the relative phase difference between the two Doppler frequencies. In such a system, a mixer is
used to combine the two transmitted frequencies and to separate the two received frequencies. This
permits the use of one transmitting and receiving antenna.
