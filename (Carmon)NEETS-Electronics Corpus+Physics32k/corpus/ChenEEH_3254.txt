load studies on feeders or distribution substations, the system’s
lagging reactive loads (i.e., power demands) can be determined
and the results can be plotted on a curve. This curve is called
the reactive load duration curve and is the cumulative sum of
the consumer’s reactive loads and the system’s reactive power
requirements. Once the daily reactive load curve is obtained,
then, by visual inspection of the curve, the size of the ﬁxed
capacitors can be found to meet the minimum reactive load.
All capacitor banks require protection. The entire bank will be
protected with a fuse or circuit breaker, and each capacitor will
be fused. The capacitors can be connected via either delta or
wye. The ungrounded wye is a preferred conﬁguration because
if a capacitor should short out in one leg of the wye, the other
two legs will limit the fault current.
