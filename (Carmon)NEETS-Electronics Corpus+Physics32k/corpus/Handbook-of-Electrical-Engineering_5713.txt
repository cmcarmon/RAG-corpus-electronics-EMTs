Flicker  is  mainly  associated  with  the  arc  furnaces  because  they  draw
different amounts of current each power cycle. The upshot is a modulation
of the system voltage magnitude in the vicinity of the furnace. The mod-
ulation frequency is in the band 0 to 30 Hz, which is in the range that can
cause noticeable ï¬‚icker of light bulbs.
