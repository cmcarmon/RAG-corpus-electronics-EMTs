(b) From the sketches of Figure E14.1.1(b), for θ = 0, x(t ) = Aej2πf0t , the real part and
the magnitude are even; the imaginary part and the phase are odd. Noting that a complex
signal x(t) is called hermitian if its real part is even and its imaginary part is odd, the
signal and symmetry are then said to be hermitian.
