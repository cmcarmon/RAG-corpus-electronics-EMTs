SPACE WAVE.—The space wave follows two distinct paths from the transmitting antenna to the 
receiving antenna—one through the air directly to the receiving antenna, the other reflected from the 
ground to the receiving antenna. This is illustrated in figure 2-13. The primary path of the space wave is 
directly from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna. So, the receiving antenna must be located 
within the radio horizon of the transmitting antenna. Because space waves are refracted slightly, even 
when propagated through the troposphere, the radio horizon is actually about one-third farther than the 
line-of-sight or natural horizon.
