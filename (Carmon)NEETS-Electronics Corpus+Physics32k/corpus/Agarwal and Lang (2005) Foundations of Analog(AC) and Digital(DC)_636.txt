Figure 4.38 provides further insight into the result in Equations 4.62 and
4.63 (or its simplified form in Equation 4.65). Equation 4.62 establishes the
VD, ID operating point or the bias point of the diode. ID/VTH is the slope of
the v i curve at the point VD, ID. The product of the slope of the v i curve at
VD, ID (given by ID/VTH) and the small perturbation in applied diode voltage
