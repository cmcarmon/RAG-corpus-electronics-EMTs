The most general maneuver described by the steady flight equations above is a steady climbing or descending coordinated turn. The trajectory the aircraft flies during this maneuver is a helix with zE as its axis and a circular projection on the xE-yE plane. Other steady flight maneuvers are special cases of this helical trajectory.
Steady longitudinal climbs or descents (without turning): bank angle μ=0
Steady level turns: flight-path angle γ=0
Steady level longitudinal flight, also known as "flying straight and level": bank angle μ=0 and flight-path angle γ=0
Steady gliding descents, whether turning or longitudinal: thrust T=0
The definition of steady flight also allows for other maneuvers that are steady only instantaneously if the control inputs are held constant. These include the steady roll, where there is a constant and non-zero roll rate, and the steady pull up, where there is a constant but non-zero pitch rate.
