signal xs(t). Multiplication in the time domain yields convolu-
tion in the frequency domain. This is another way of express-
ing the Fourier transform of the sampled signal xs(t) as a
convolution integral of the Fourier transforms Xc(ejV) and
S(ejV).
transform is a train of impulses with spacing f Â¼ 1=T
