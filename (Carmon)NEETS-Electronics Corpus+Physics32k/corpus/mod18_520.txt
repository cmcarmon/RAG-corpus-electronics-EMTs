Radars that use blowers for cooling will usually have an airflow sensing switch. If the blower fails, 
the switch will open and remove power from appropriate power supplies. Radars employing liquid 
cooling normally distribute the liquid into a large number of separate paths, because the flow 
requirements are quite dissimilar. Each of the various paths will have a low flow interlock. If one of the 
liquid cooling paths becomes restricted, the low flow interlock switch will open and remove power from 
the radar.
