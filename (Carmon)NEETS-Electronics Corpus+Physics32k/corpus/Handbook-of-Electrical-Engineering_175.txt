comparing the I 2t characteristics for feeder and branch circuit fuses. The branch fuse should have a total clearing
I 2t value that is less than the melting  I 2t value of the feeder or upstream fuse. This ensures that the branch
fuse will melt, arc, and clear the fault before the feeder fuse begins to melt.
