Another method for increasing voltages is known as voltage multiplication. VOLTAGE 
MULTIPLIERS are used primarily to develop high voltages where low current is required. The most 
common application of the high voltage outputs of voltage multipliers is the anode of cathode-ray tubes 
(CRT), which are used for radar scope presentations, oscilloscope presentations, or TV picture tubes. The 
dc output of the voltage multiplier ranges from 1000 volts to 30,000 volts. The actual voltage depends 
upon the size of the CRT and its equipment application.
