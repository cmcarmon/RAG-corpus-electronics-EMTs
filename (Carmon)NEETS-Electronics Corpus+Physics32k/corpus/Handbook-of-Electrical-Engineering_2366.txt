This carrier concentration is again used in Poisson’s equation, and new values of jn, En, and n are calculated.
This process is repeated until a self-consistent solution is obtained. The ﬁnal wave vector is invoked to determine
the scattering matrix, after which MCT is used to yield the carrier distribution and current densities.
