The various FBI mnemonics (for electric motors) show the direction of the force on a conductor carrying a current in a magnetic field as predicted by Fleming's left hand rule for motors and Faraday's law of induction.
Other mnemonics exist that use a right hand rule for predicting resulting motion from a preexisting current and field.
