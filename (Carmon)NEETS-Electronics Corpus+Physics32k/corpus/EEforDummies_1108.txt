Voltmeters are so important in electronics, they have their own circuit 
symbol, which is shown in Figure 16-3, left. You may see this symbol with 
leads touching points in a circuit you read about on a website or in an elec-
tronics book. It tells you to take a voltage measurement across the two indi-
cated points.
