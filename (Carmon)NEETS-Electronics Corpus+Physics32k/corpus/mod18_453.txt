An extremely irregular spectrum, as in the curve in view D, is an indication of severe frequency 
modulation. This condition usually causes trouble with the receiver automatic frequency control (afc) as 
well as a general loss of signal strength. You can often improve a faulty spectrum by adjusting the 
transmission line stubs or by replacing the transmitter tube. When the spectrum has two large peaks that 
are quite far apart, it indicates that the transmitter tube is DOUBLE MODING (shifting from one 
frequency to another). This could be caused by standing waves in the transmission line or a faulty 
transmitter tube. Standing waves may be caused by a faulty line connection, a bad antenna rotating joint, 
or obstructions in the line. (Standing waves are described in NEETS, Module 10, Introduction to Wave 
Propagation, Transmission Lines, and Antennas.)
