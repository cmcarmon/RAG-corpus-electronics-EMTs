Note that the reset pin (pin 4) of the 555 timer is not tied to the positive 
power supply, as it has been in 555 oscillator circuits described previously in 
this chapter. This fact is significant because if the reset pin is tied high, the 
555 timer will just keep on oscillating (and the speaker will keep producing a 
tone) as long as power is applied. If a low voltage is applied to the reset pin, 
however, the 555 timerâ€™s internal timing circuit is reset, the output (pin 3) 
goes low, and the speaker is quiet.
