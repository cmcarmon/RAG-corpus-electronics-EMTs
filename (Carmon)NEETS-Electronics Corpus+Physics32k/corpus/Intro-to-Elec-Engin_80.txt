(1.2.14)
where vint is the internal voltage drop within the source, which depends on the amount of current
drawn by the load. As seen from Equation (1.2.14), the voltage actually seen by the load vL
is somewhat lower than the open-circuit voltage of the source. When the load resistance RL is
inÔ¨Ånitely large, the load current iL goes to zero, and the load voltage vL is then equal to the
open-circuit voltage of the source v. Hence, it is desirable to have as small an internal resistance
as possible in a practical voltage source.
From Figure 1.2.4(b) it follows that
