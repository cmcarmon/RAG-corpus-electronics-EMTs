available power to the load. When a TRIAC is used 
to vary the amount of AC power applied to the load, 
a special triggering device is needed to ensure that 
the TRIAC functions at the proper time. The trig-
gering device is necessary because the TRIAC is not 
equally sensitive to the gate current flowing in oppo-
site directions.
