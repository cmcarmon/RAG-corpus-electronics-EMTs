Many vehicles are only narrowly suborbital, so practically anything that gives a relatively small delta-v increase can be helpful, and outside assistance for a vehicle is therefore desirable.
Proposed launch assists include:
sled launch (rail, maglev including Bantam, MagLifter, and StarTram, etc.)
aircraft tow
in-flight fueling
Lofstrom launch loop/space fountains
And on-orbit resources such as:
Space tether
tugs
