The resistor protects the LEDs by limiting the current that flows through 
them (refer to Chapter 5 for details). The resistor also slows down the capaci-
tor’s charging/discharging process so that you can observe the LEDs lighting. 
By carefully selecting the resistor and capacitor values, you can control the 
charge/discharge timing, as you see in the section titled “Teaming Up with 
Resistors,” later in this chapter.
