We realize L ¼ 12=5 as an inductor in series. This has taken
care of the second transfer zero of z12. The remaining function
is Z4 ¼ 18=5 s. By inverting it, we have Y4 ¼ 5 s=18 and
remove the last transfer zero as a pole at inﬁnity by connecting
a capacitor C ¼ 5=18 in parallel. The whole network is in
Figure 4.30. Let us now check our result logically. Inductors
in series obstruct transfer of high frequencies and capacitors in
parallel represent short circuits at high frequencies. Hence,
each of the capacitors in parallel and the middle inductor in
series will indeed help in suppressing high frequencies and
create together three zeros at inﬁnity.
