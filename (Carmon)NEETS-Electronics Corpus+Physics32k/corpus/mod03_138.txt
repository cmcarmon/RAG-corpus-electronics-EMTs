In figure 1-26(A), a series circuit is shown with R1 equaling 15 ohms and R2 equaling 10 ohms. The
voltage across R2 (ER2) equals 10 volts. If a meter (represented by R3) with a resistance of 10 ohms is
connected in parallel with R2, as in figure 1-26(B), the combined resistance of R2 and R3 (Rn) is equal to 5
ohms. The voltage across R2 and R3 is now 6.25 volts, and that is what the meter will indicate. Notice that
the voltage across R1 and the circuit current have both increased. The addition of the meter (R3) has
loaded the circuit.
