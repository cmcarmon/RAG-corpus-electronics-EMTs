We will begin our discussion with a brief statement of how computer networking came about and a capsule
wide-area
description of the networks that resulted from the early efforts. Networks of this generic class, called 
networks
are broadly deployed today, and there are still a large number of unanswered questions with
respect  to  their  design.  The  issues  involved  in  the  design  of  those  networks  are  basic  to  the  design  of  most
networks, whether wide area or otherwise. In the process of introducing these early systems, we will describe
and contrast three basic types of communication switching: circuit, message, and packet.
