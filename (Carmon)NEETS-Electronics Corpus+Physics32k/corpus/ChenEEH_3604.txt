Figure 2.17 shows different responses obtained by using the
rectangular and Sara¨maki windows on a low-pass ﬁlter. It can
be seen that the Sara¨maki window showed improvements with
respect to the rectangular window response. In fact, the rec-
tangular window has a high order of 248; to satisfy the speciﬁ-
cations, the transition band had to be reduced due to the high
ripples close to the band edges. The Sara¨maki window required
order 48 to meet the speciﬁcations.
