When measuring a known dc voltage, position the range switch to a setting that will cause
approximately midscale deflection. Readings taken near the center of the scale are the most accurate.
When measuring an unknown dc voltage, always begin on the highest voltage range. Using the range
switch, work down to an appropriate range. If the meter pointer moves to the left, you should reverse the
polarity of the function switch.
