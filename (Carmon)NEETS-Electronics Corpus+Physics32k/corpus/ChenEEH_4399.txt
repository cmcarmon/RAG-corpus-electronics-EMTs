The complex matrix G(jv) 2 C pp is called the frequency
response matrix, and it can be used to determine the size of
G(s) at a particular frequency v.
In general, the size of G(s) is deﬁned as the gain from an
input to its corresponding output. If the input is u(t) ¼ uejvt ,
the gain of G(s) at v can be deﬁned at steady-state to be the
ratio of the Euclidean vector norms kyk=kuk. This concept of
gain is bounded as follows:
