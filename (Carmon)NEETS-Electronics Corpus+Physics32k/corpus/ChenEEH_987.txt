Appendix B: Algorithm LMCS-2
To illustrate algorithm LMCS-2 (introduced in Section 4.5),
consider again the circuit example C1 introduced in Section 4.3;
the corresponding circuit graph and spanning tree are shown
in Figures 4.7 and 4.8(A), respectively. The matrices N ¼ I þ
Ct C, L2, and X, respectively, in equation 4.83 are as follows:
