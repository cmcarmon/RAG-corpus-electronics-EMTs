The TEM mode on a transmission line can be represented by the
equivalent circuit, shown in Figure 4.7, for a length Dz. Phys-
ically, this is a distributed circuit because the circuit elements
are not lumped at discrete locations as in a conventional low-
frequency circuit but distributed uniformly along the length of
the line. Thus, the elements are deﬁned on per-unit-length
basis. The series resistance per unit length, R, is the combined
resistance of all the conductors in the line, and it accounts for
power dissipation in the conductors. As exempliﬁed in Figure
4.3 for a coaxial line, current ﬂow along the conductor’s surface
is accompanied by a circumferential magnetic ﬁeld. The linkage
of this magnetic ﬂux with the current produces a combined
inductance per unit length, L, which accounts for ﬂux linkages
both internal and external to the conductors. Positive and
negative charges of equal magnitude are deposited on the two
conductors (Figure 4.3). This charge separation creates a poten-
tial difference between the conductors, which accounts for the
capacitance per unit length, C. The shunt conductance per unit
length, G, accounts for the power dissipation in the non-ideal
dielectric medium between the conductors.
