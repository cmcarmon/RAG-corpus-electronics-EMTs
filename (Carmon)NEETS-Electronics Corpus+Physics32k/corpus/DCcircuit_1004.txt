The coefﬁcients of the last pair of equations above have been rearranged to show a pattern.
The sum of conductances connected to the ﬁrst node is the positive coefﬁcient of the ﬁrst voltage
in equation (1). The sum of conductances connected to the second node is the positive coefﬁ-
cient of the second voltage in equation (2). The other coefﬁcients are negative, representing
conductances between nodes. For both equations, the right hand side is equal to the respective
current source connected to the node. This pattern allows us to quickly write the equations by
inspection. This leads to a set of rules for the node voltage method of analysis.
