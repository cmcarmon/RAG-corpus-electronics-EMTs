To account for realistic variances in component timing due to manufacturing tolerances, aging, or environ-
mental  effects,  timing  analysis  often  provides  stochastic  or  statistical  checking  capabilities.  Statistical  timing
analysis uses random-number generators based on empirically observed probabilistic distributions to determine
component timing behavior. Thus, statistical timing analysis describes design performance and the likelihood
of the design performance.
