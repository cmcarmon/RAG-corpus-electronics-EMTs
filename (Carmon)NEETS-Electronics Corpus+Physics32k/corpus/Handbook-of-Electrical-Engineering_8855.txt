Technology does not permit memories that are cheap, large, and fast. By recognizing the nonrandom nature
 rather than worst case latency, it is possible to implement a
of memory requests, and emphasizing the 
hierarchical memory system that performs well. A small amount of very fast memory, placed in front of a large,
slow memory, can be designed to satisfy most requests at the speed of the small memory. This, in fact, is the
primary motivation for the use of registers in the CPU: in this case, the programmer or compiler makes sure
that the most commonly accessed variables are allocated to registers.
