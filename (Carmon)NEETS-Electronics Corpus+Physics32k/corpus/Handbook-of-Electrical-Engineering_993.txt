Step 9 uses NFS to ﬁt the slope of the log(Ids) vs. Vg s  curve. Often the value of VT0 obtained from step 1 will
prevent  one  from  obtaining  a  good  ﬁt  in  the  subthreshold  region.  If  this  happens,  try  ﬁtting  with VT0  and
NFS, but replacing the ﬁnal value of VT0 with that from step 1 at the end, keeping only NFS from this ﬁnal step.
The above steps illustrate the concepts of ﬁtting relevant subsets of parameters to relevant subsets of data to
obtain physical values of the parameters, as well as ﬁtting parameters in the proper order so that those obtained
in the later steps will affect those obtained in earlier steps minimally. Please refer to Figs. 13.13 and 13.14 for
how  the  resulting  ﬁts  typically  appear  (all  graphs  showing  model  ﬁts  are  provided  by  the  device  modeling
software package Aurora, from Technology Modeling Associates, Inc., Palo Alto, CA).
