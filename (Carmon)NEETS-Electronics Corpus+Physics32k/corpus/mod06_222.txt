 L. The potential difference between the plate and the cathode is now
280 volts. In view C, Rk has now been placed in the same circuit. Rk drops 20 volts. Therefore, the effect
of cathode biasing is to reduce the maximum positive signal that the circuit can produce. In this case, the
maximum positive signal has been reduced by 20 volts. Despite these disadvantages, cathode biasing has
two main advantages. It is simple and economical.
