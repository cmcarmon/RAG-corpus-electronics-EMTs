From the 1980s onward, the emergent approach to organizational change has dominated. The emergent approach argues that change is continuous and unpredictable. Rather than happening through big events, change is happening all of the time through many small steps, and organizations do not have the luxury of dealing with one change at a time. This approach also takes into account the importance of power to organizational culture.
Many followers of this approach argue that organizations must be able to change themselves continuously, especially in fast moving sectors of the economy.
