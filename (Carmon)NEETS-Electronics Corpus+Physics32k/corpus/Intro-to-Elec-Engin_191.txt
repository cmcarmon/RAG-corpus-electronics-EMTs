Sometimes, for clarity, additional letters following a numerical value may be used; but these are
ignored by SPICE. For example, 4.4 KOHMS is recognized as the value 4400, and “ohms” is
ignored by the program. Comment statements are identiﬁed by an asterisk (*) in the ﬁrst column,
and these are helpful for making the program meaningful to users. PSpice also allows inserting
comments on any line by starting the comment with a semicolon. Figure 2.5.2 shows the four
types of controlled sources and their corresponding PSpice statements.
