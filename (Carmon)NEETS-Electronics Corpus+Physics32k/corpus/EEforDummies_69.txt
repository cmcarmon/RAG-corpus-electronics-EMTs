Ben Franklin was one of the first people to observe and experiment with elec-
tricity, and he came up with many of the terms and concepts (for instance, 
current) we know and love today. Contrary to popular belief, Franklin didn’t 
actually hold the key at the end of his kite string during that storm in 1752.  
(If he had, he wouldn’t have been around for the American Revolution.) He 
may have performed that experiment, but not by holding the key.
