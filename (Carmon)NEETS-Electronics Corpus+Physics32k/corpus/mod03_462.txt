A manual switch is a switch that is controlled by a person. In other words, a manual switch is a
switch that you turn on or off. Examples of common manual switches are a light switch, the ignition
switch on a motor vehicle, or the channel selector on a television. You may not think of the channel
selector as a switch that you use to turn something on or off, but that is what it does. The channel selector
is used to turn on the proper circuit and allows the television to receive the channel you have selected.
