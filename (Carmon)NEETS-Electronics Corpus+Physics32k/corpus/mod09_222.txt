If the oscillator stage must develop high power, efficiency becomes important. Many oscillators use 
class C bias to increase efficiency. Other types of oscillators may use class A bias when a high efficiency 
is not required but distortion must be kept at a minimum. Other classes of bias may also be used with 
certain oscillators.
