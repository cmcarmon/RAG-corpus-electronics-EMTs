Speech recognition is the process of converting an acoustic signal to a textual message. High recognition accuracy
is of prime importance in order for a speech interface to be of any practical use in a dictation task, or any kind
of intelligent human–machine interaction. Speech recognition is made extremely difﬁcult by co-articulation,
variations  in  speaking  styles,  rates,  vocal-tract  size  across  speakers,  and  communication  channels.  Speech
research has been underway for over 4 decades, and many problems have been addressed and solved fully or
partially.  High  performance  can  be  achieved  on  tasks  such  as  isolated  word  recognition,  small  and  middle
vocabulary  recognition,  and  recognition  of  speech  in  nonadverse  conditions.  Large  vocabulary  (over  30K
words),  speaker-independent,  continuous  speech  recognition  has  been  one  of  the  major  research  targets  for
years. Although for some large vocabulary tasks, high recognition accuracies have been achieved [7], signiﬁcant
challenges emerge as more and more applications make themselves viable for speech input.
