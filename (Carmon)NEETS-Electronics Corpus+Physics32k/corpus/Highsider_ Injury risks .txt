The term highside derives from the side of the motorcycle that the rider will separate from. If forcibly thrown over the bike, the rider is said to have dismounted on the high side.
The violent motion of the motorbike usually throws the rider several feet into the air which can result in broken bones on impact with the road surface
As the highside catches the rider unexpectedly, the rider's limbs can be thrown into protrusions on the bike (usually the handlebars) and suffer contusions
The rider is thrown ahead of the bike and is at risk of being hit and seriously injured by the bike, particularly if the rider stops quickly
Because highsider accidents are so much more deadly than lowside accidents, the Motorcycle Safety Foundation recommends that if a rider locks the rear brake at higher speeds and the traction is good the brake should not be released.
