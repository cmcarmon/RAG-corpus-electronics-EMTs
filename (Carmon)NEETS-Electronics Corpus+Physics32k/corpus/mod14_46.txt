Blaise Pascal (French) invented the first adding machine in 1642. Twenty years later, an Englishman,
Sir Samuel Moreland, developed a more compact device that could multiply, add, and subtract. About
1672, Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz (German) perfected a machine that could perform all the basic
operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide), as well as extract the square root. Modern electronic digital
computers still use von Liebniz's principles.
