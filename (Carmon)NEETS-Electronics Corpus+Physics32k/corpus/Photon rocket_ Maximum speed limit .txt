Standard theory says that the speed limit of a photon rocket is below the speed of light. Haug has recently, in Acta Astronautica, suggested a maximum speed limit for an ideal photon rockets that is just below the speed of light. This speed he has suggested is a function of the heaviest subatomic particle in the rocket. The maximum velocity can based on this be calculated to be

where

{\displaystyle {\bar {\lambda }}}
is the reduced Compton wavelength of the subatomic fundamental particle. This velocity is for known subatomic particles above what currently can be achieved at the Large Hadron Collider, but below the speed of light. Based on the relativistic rocket equation this also means two Planck masses of fuel is needed for every subatomic particle in payload in the ideal photon rocket to reach maximum velocity.
