With the invention of the transistor in 1947, the 
focus of electronic design shifted away from 
bulky vacuum tubes to this newer, smaller, more 
reliable device. Because size was no longer an 
obstacle, engineers worked to build more and 
more advanced circuits. Their success in cre-
ating advanced designs, however, led to some 
practical problems: Interconnecting hundreds 
of components inevitably resulted in errors that 
were extremely difficult to isolate. Additionally, 
complex  circuits  often  failed  to  meet  speed 
requirements  (because  it  does  take  some 
time for electrons to travel through a maze of 
wires and components). Throughout the 1950s, 
a major focus in the electronics industry was 
figuring out how to make circuits smaller and 
more reliable.
In  1952,  a  British  engineer  named  Geoffrey 
Dummer publicly presented his idea for com-
bining multiple circuit elements onto a single 
piece of semiconductor material with no con-
necting wires. He reasoned this would eliminate 
the faulty wiring and the cumbersome manual 
assembly  of  discrete  components.  Although 
Dummer never actually built an IC, he is widely 
regarded  as  the  “Prophet  of  the  Integrated 
Circuit.”
Then, in the summer of 1958, Jack Kilby, a newly 
employed engineer at Texas Instruments work-
ing alone in a lab (while his colleagues were
