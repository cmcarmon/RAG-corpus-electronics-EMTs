The previous bulleted list explains the reasons that compres-
sion technologies have helped the development of compressed
domain-based modern communication systems and compact
and rugged consumer products. Although compression in gen-
eral is a useful technology, and, in the case of multimedia data,
an essential one, it should be used with caution because it comes
with some drawbacks as well. By deÔ¨Ånition, compression re-
moves redundancy from signals. Redundancy is, however, es-
sential in making data resistant to errors. As a result, compressed
data is more sensitive to errors than uncompressed data. Thus,
transmission systems using compressed data must incorporate
more powerful error-correction strategies. Most of the text-
compression techniques, such as the Lampel-Ziv-Welch codes,
are very sensitive to bit errors: an error in the transmission of the
code table value results in bit errors every time the table location
is accessed. This phenomenon is known as error propagation.
Other variable-length coding techniques, such as Huffman
coding, are also sensitive to bit errors. In real-time multimedia
applications, such as audio and video communications, some
error concealment must be used in case of errors.
