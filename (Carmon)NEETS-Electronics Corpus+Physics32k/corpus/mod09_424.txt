A basic principle of inductance is that if the increase of current through a coil is linear; that is, the 
rate of current increase is constant with respect to time, then the induced voltage will be constant. This is 
true in both the primary and secondary of a transformer. Figure 3-32, view (B), shows the voltage 
waveform across the coil when the current through it increases at a constant rate. Notice that this 
waveform is similar in shape to the trigger pulse shown earlier in figure 3-1, view (E). By definition, a 
blocking oscillator is a special type of oscillator which uses inductive regenerative feedback. The output
