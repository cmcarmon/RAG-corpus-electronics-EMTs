{\displaystyle \ln \gamma _{i}=\ln \gamma _{i}^{C}+\ln \gamma _{i}^{R}}

The first is an entropic term quantifying the deviation from ideal solubility as a result of differences in molecule shape. The latter is an enthalpic  correction caused by the change in interacting forces between different molecules upon mixing.
