▶✓ Full‐wave rectification: By arranging four diodes in a circuit known as  
a bridge rectifier, you can convert both the ups and the downs (relative 
to 0 V) of an AC voltage into just ups (see Figure 9­7). This full‐wave 
 rectifier is the first stage of circuitry in a linear power supply, which 
 converts AC power into a steady DC power supply.
Bridge rectifiers are so popular, you can purchase them as a single four‐
terminal part, with two leads for the AC input and two leads for the DC 
output.
