Our receiver has five basic stages excluding the power supply. With the exception of a video 
amplifier in place of an rf amplifier, the circuits perform the functions normally associated with a typical 
receiver. Figure 5-6 is a block diagram showing the signal paths of the receiver. The input stage consists 
of a low-pass filter, an attenuator, a calibration oscillator, and a video amplifier. The low-pass filter passes 
input frequencies below 900 kilohertz. These frequencies are passed to the attenuator, which sets the 
signal to the proper level to drive the mixer. This minimizes noise and distortion. The calibration 
oscillator produces a 250-kilohertz output. It is used to calibrate the receiver level and to check for tuning 
dial accuracy. The input signal is direct-coupled from the attenuator to the video amplifier. This amplifier 
is a broadband, constant-impedance driver for the mixer. The oscillator-mixer stage consists of a mixer, 
phase splitter, local oscillator, and frequency control circuits.
