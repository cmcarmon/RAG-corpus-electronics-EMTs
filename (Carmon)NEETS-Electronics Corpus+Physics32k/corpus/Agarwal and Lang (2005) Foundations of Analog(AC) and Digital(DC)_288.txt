Once the two sets of equations are assembled, which is a relatively easy
task, the analysis of a circuit essentially becomes a problem of mathematics, as
indicated by Step 4. That is, the equations assembled earlier must be combined
and used to solve for the branch currents and voltages of interest. However,
because there is more than one way to approach this problem, our study of
circuit analysis does not end with the direct approach outlined here. Consider-
able time can be saved, and considerable insight can be gained, by approaching
circuit analyses in different ways. These gains are important subjects of this
and future chapters.
