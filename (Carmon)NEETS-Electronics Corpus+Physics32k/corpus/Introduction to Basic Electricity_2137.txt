In other words, if the values of RA, RB, and RC are 
known, it is easy to calculate RX. RC would have to be 
measured with a meter to determine its value after 
adjusting for a zero reading. In an actual Wheatstone 
bridge test instrument, RA and RB are fixed, RC is ad-
justed, and RX can be easily read off a sliding scale con-
nected to RC. The circuit for a Wheatstone bridge as 
designed by Wheatstone is shown in Figure 17-20. This 
is how the circuit is drawn for applications using it.
