Power, Amplitude, and Phase Spectra
If f(t) represents voltage or current waveform supplying a load of 1 W, the left-hand side of Parseval’s theorem
(14.39) represents the power dissipated in the 1-W resistor. Therefore, the right-hand side represents the power
contributed by each harmonic of the spectrum. Thus the DFT power spectrum is deﬁned as
