The goal of the control system designer is to specify the
inputs to a dynamic system to force the system to perform
some useful purpose. This task can be interpreted as forcing
the system from its state at t0 to a desired state at a future time
t1 > t0. Obtaining accurate knowledge of the state at t0 and
for all t between t0 and t1 is often critical to the completion
of this control objective. This process is referred to as state
estimation.
