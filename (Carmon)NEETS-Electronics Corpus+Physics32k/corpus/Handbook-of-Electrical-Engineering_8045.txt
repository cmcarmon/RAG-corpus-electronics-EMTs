For  groceries,  the  ﬁrst  ﬁve  decimal  digits  identify  the  manufacturer  and  the  second  group  of  ﬁve  digits
identify  the  speciﬁc  product.  There  are  additional  codes  in  use  as  well,  such  as  the  National  Drug  Code.  By
using a microprocessor-based system, a POS terminal can be quickly reconﬁgured to recognize a different code
(or multiple codes) through a simple software change.
