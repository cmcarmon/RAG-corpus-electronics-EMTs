Taking an electronic circuit and creating a PCB 
prototype can be satisfying and provides an opportu-
nity to tap into an individualâ€™s creativity. A challenge 
faced when engaging in electronic circuit PCB pro-
totyping is underestimating the time it will take to 
complete a layout. It should be noted that the phase of 
redesign and correction often take as long as the initial 
design process.
