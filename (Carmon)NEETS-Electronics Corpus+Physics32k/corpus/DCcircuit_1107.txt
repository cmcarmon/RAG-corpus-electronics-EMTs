The ideal battery, in a short circuit with 0 Ω resistance, would be able to supply an inﬁnite
amount of current. The real battery, on the other hand, can only supply 50 amps (10 volts /
0.2 Ω) to a short circuit of 0 Ω resistance, due to its internal resistance. The chemical reaction
inside the cell may still be providing exactly 10 volts, but voltage is dropped across that internal
resistance as electrons ﬂow through the battery, which reduces the amount of voltage available
at the battery terminals to the load.
