11.9  Give examples of (a) two input devices, and 
 
(b)  two  output  devices  commonly  used  in 
 
microprocessor systems. 
11.10  Explain the purpose of the circuit shown in 
Fig.  11.19  and  state  the  function  of  the 
 
 
components marked A, B and C. 
11.11  Sketch  two  cycles  of  the  typical  output 
waveform produced by the circuit shown in 
 
Fig. 11.19. Include labelled axes of time and 
 
 
voltage.
