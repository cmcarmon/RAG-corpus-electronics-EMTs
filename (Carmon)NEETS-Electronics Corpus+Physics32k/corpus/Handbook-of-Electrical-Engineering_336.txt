Nevertheless,  some  conclusions  about  power  can  be  derived  from  Tellegenâ€™s  theorem.  Since  a  network  is
topologically equivalent to itself, the b network can be the same as the a network. In that case each vi product
in Eq. (3.3) represents the power delivered to the corresponding branch, including the sources. The equation
then says that if we add the power delivered to all the branches of a network, the result will be zero.
