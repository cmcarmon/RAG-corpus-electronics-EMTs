We now assume that the unconstrained system S is subjected to a set of m consistent equality constraints given by

{\displaystyle \mathbf {A} (q,{\dot {q}},t){\ddot {\mathbf {q} }}=\mathbf {b} (q,{\dot {q}},t),}

where A is a known m-by-n matrix of rank r and b is a known m-vector. We note that this set of constraint equations encompass a very general variety of holonomic and non-holonomic equality constraints. For example, holonomic constraints of the form




φ
(
q
,
t
)
=
0


{\displaystyle \varphi (q,t)=0}

can be differentiated twice with respect to time while non-holonomic constraints of the form




ψ
(
q
,



q
˙



,
t
)
=
0


{\displaystyle \psi (q,{\dot {q}},t)=0}

can be differentiated once with respect to time to obtain the m-by-n matrix A and the m-vector b. In short, constraints may be specified that are
nonlinear functions of displacement and velocity,
explicitly dependent on time, and
functionally dependent.
As a consequence of subjecting these constraints to the unconstrained system S, an additional force is conceptualized to arise, namely, the force of constraint. Therefore, the constrained system Sc becomes

where Qc—the constraint force—is the additional force needed to satisfy the imposed constraints. The central problem of constrained motion is now stated as follows:
given the unconstrained equations of motion of the system S,
given the generalized displacement q(t) and the generalized velocity

as stated above,
find the equations of motion for the constrained system—the acceleration—at time t, which is in accordance with the agreed upon principles of analytical dynamics.
