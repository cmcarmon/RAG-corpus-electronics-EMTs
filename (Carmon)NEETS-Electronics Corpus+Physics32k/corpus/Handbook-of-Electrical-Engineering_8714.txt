In  this  example,  we  assume  the  presence  of  a
pushdown stack (see  Fig.  87.10).  The  PUSH  and
POP operations are machine-level instructions for
loading/storing  the  top  element  of  the  stack.  The
POWER,  MULT,  and  SUB  instructions  take  their
arguments from the top of the stack and return the
results of exponentiation, multiplication, and sub-
traction  to  the  top  of  the  stack.  The  symbolic
expression  of  calculation  in  fortran  becomes  a
sequence of low-level machine instructions which
often bear little resemblance to the HLL program.
The foregoing example illustrates the mechani-
cal advantage provided by FORTRAN because one
FORTRAN  statement  is  implemented  by  many
