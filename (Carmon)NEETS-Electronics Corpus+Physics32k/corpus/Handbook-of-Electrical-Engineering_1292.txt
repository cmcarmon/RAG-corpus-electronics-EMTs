with the ak parameters selected to ensure that the ﬁrst component of ap is one as required. The upper limit in
this sum is given by s = 1 + min( p –  ˜p, q –  ˜q) while the vectors vk correspond to the s eigenvectors associated
with zero eigenvalue of multiplicity s of matrix D*p,qDp,q where Dp,q is the (N + 1) ·  (p + q + 2) composite data
