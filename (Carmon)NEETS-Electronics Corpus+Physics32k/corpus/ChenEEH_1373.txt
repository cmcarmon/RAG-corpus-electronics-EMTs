With the introduction of the single-chip multiprocessor
(Olukotun et al., 1996), the dividing line between research
into high-performance system architectures and high-per-
formance processors is becoming blurred. Very coarse-grained
programmable logic devices such as Chess (Marshall et al.,
1999) or the RAW machines proposed by Waingold et al.
(1997) can be considered radically different forms of multi-
processor architecture. These approaches eliminate traditional
instruction-set interfaces and instead rely heavily on compi-
lation to directly customize the hardware to a particular ap-
plication. Relying on compilation is possible because the
hardware consists of a simple regular array of interchangable
processing units. Clearly, this blurs the boundary between
compiler research and traditional high-level synthesis, another
area under intense investigation (Detton and Wawrzynek,
1999) Extending this approach of exposing the inner archi-
tecture of a processor to the compiler even further results
