Propagation Delay
Propagation delay is deﬁned as the ﬂight time of packets over
the transmission link and is limited by the speed of light. For
example, if the source and destination are in the same building
at the distance of 200 m, the propagation delay will be  1
msec. If they are located in different countries at a distance of
20,000 km, however, the delay is in order of 0.1 sec. The above
values represent the physical limits and cannot be reduced.
This has major
interactive multimedia
applications that require the response time to be less than
200 msec. Thus if the one-way propagation delay is greater
than this value, then no enhancements can improve the quality
of the interactive sessions, and the user will have to settle for a
less responsive system.
