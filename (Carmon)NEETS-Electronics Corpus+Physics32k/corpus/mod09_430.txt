From T1 to T2 (figure 3-34), transistor Q1 is held at cutoff by C1 discharging through R1 (figure 
3-33). The transistor is now said to be "blocked." As C1 gradually loses its charge, the voltage on the base 
of Q1 returns to a forward-bias condition. At T2, the voltage on the base has become sufficiently positive 
to forward bias Q1, and the cycle is repeated.
