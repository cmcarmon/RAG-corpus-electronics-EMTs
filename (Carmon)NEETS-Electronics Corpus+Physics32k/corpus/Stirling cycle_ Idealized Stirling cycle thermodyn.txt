The idealized Stirling cycle consists of four thermodynamic processes acting on the working fluid (See diagram to right):
Isothermal expansion. The expansion space is heated externally, and the gas undergoes near-isothermal expansion.
Constant-volume (known as isovolumetric or isochoric) heat removal. The gas is passed through the regenerator, thus cooling the gas, and transferring heat to the regenerator for use in the next cycle.
Isothermal compression. The compression space is intercooled, so the gas undergoes near-isothermal compression.
Constant-volume heat addition. The compressed air flows back through the regenerator and picks up heat on the way to the heated expansion space.
