This section introduces and analyzes the electronic circuit realizations of the basic gates of the three technologies:
transistor-transistor logic (TTL), emitter-coupled logic (ECL), and complementary metal-oxide semiconductor
(CMOS)  logic.  These  circuits  are  commercially  available  on  small-scale  integration  chips  and  are  also  the
building blocks for more elaborate logic systems. The three technologies are compared with regard to speed,
power consumption, and noise immunity, and parameters are deÔ¨Åned which facilitate these comparisons. Also
included are recommendations which are useful in choosing and using these technologies.
