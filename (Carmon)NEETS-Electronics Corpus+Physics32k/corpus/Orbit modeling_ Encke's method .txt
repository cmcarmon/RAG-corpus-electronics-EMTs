Encke's method begins with the osculating orbit as a reference and integrates numerically to solve for the variation from the reference as a function of time. Its advantages are that perturbations are generally small in magnitude, so the integration can proceed in larger steps (with resulting lesser errors), and the method is much less affected by extreme perturbations than Cowell's method. Its disadvantage is complexity; it cannot be used indefinitely without occasionally updating the osculating orbit and continuing from there, a process known as rectification.
Letting

{\displaystyle \mathbf {r} }
the radius vector of the perturbed orbit, and



δ

{\displaystyle \delta \mathbf {r} }
the variation from the osculating orbit,

{\displaystyle \mathbf {\ddot {r}} }
and
