Suppose we rank a group of five people by height and by weight:
Here person A is tallest and third-heaviest, and so on.
In order to calculate the Kendall tau distance, pair each person with every other person and count the number of times the values in list 1 are in the opposite order of the values in list 2.
Since there are 4 pairs whose values are in opposite order, the Kendall tau distance is 4. The normalized Kendall tau distance is

0.4.


{\displaystyle {\frac {4}{5(5-1)/2}}=0.4.}

A value of 0.4 indicates that 40% of pairs differ in ordering between the two lists.
