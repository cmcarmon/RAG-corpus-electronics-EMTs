The energy band diagram at the onset of threshold is shown
in Figure 3.24. The threshold is typically taken as the gate bias
at which the conduction band of the GaAs layer coincides with
the Fermi level. The 2-D electron gas forms at the heterointer-
face immediately under the undoped AlGaAs buffer layer and
resembles the inversion layer that forms under the gate dielec-
tric of a MOSFET.
