The major characteristics of an optical isolator include isolation level, insertion loss, temperature dependence,
and size of the device. These characteristics are mainly determined by the material used in the rotator. Rotating
materials generally fall into three categories: the paramagnetics (such as terbium-doped borosilicate glass), the
diamagnetic  (such  as  zinc  selenide),  and  the  ferromagnetic  (such  as  rare-earth  garnets).  The  ﬁrst  two  kinds
have small Verdet constants and mostly work in the visible or shorter optical wavelength range. Isolators for
use with the InGaAsP semiconductor diode lasers (l0 = 1100–1600 nm), which serve as the essential light source
in  optical  communication,  utilize  the  third  kind,  especially  the  yttrium-iron-garnet  (YIG)  crystal.  A  newly
available ferromagnetic crystal, epitaxially grown bismuth-substituted yttrium-iron-garnet (BIG), has an order-
of-magnitude stronger Faraday rotation than pure YIG, and its magnetic saturation occurs at a smaller ﬁeld
[Matsuda et al., 1987]. The typical parameters with YIG and BIG are shown in Table 57.1. As the major user
of optical isolators, ﬁber optic communication systems require different input-output packaging for the isola-
tors. Table 57.2 lists the characteristics of the isolators according to speciﬁc applications [Wilson, 1991].
