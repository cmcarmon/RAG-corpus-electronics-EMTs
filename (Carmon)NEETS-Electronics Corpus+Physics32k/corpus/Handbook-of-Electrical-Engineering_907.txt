. Note
that the second two terms on the right hand side of the above equation are dependent only on the capacitor
voltage and current from the previous time step, and are therefore ﬁxed constants as far as the present step is

) multiplied by the capacitor voltage, and the

concerned. The ﬁrst term is effectively a conductance (
second two terms could be represented by an independent current source. The entire transient model for the
capacitor therefore consists of a conductance in parallel with two current sources (the numerical values of these
are, of course, different at each time step). Once the capacitors and inductors have been replaced as indicated,
the normal method of DC analysis is used. One complete DC analysis must be performed for each time point.
This is the reason that transient analysis is so CPU intensive. The method outlined here is the trapezoidal time
integration method and is used as the default in SPICE.
