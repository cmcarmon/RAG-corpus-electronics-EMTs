The wavelength at which a mode ceases to propagate is called the cutoff wavelength for that mode.
However, an optical fiber is always able to propagate at least one mode, the fundamental mode. The
fundamental mode can never be cut off. The cutoff wavelength of a single mode fiber is the wavelength
above which the fiber propagates only the fundamental mode.
