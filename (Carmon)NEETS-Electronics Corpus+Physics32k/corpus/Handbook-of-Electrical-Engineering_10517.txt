Today, electric motors are used more widely for rail vehicles than for cars, vans, or buses, although this is
slowly  changing  (see  above).  Electric  motors  as  a  back-up  mode  for  buses  are  becoming  more  common  in
certain  areas  where  air  pollution  is  considered  a  serious  problem  and  in  portions  of  systems,  such  as  North
American tunnels, where fumes from internal combustion can be hazardous.
