p r o b l e m 11.4 Consider the digital memory element illustrated in Figure 11.30.
Assume that the inverters are implemented using a pulldown NMOS transistor with on
resistance RON, and a pullup resistor RL. The power supply voltage is VS. What is the
instantaneous power dissipated by the memory element when it stores a logical 1? What
is the instantaneous power dissipated by the memory element when it stores a logical 0?
