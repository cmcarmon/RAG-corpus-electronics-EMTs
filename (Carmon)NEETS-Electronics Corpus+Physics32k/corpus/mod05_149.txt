While a dc motor is running, it acts somewhat like a dc generator. There is a magnetic field from the 
field poles, and a loop of wire is turning and cutting this magnetic field. For the moment, disregard the 
fact that there is current flowing through the loop of wire from the battery. As the loop sides cut the 
magnetic field, a voltage is induced in them, the same as it was in the loop sides of the dc generator. This 
induced voltage causes current to flow in the loop.
