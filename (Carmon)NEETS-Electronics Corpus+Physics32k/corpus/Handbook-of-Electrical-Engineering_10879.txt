that are used in CACSD, and none of them takes a standard approach to packing data structures. Thus, the
data structures used in the Multivariable Control Systems Toolbox are completely incompatible with those used
in the Systems IdentiÔ¨Åcation Toolbox, which itself is incompatible with the standard Control Systems Toolbox.
The consequence is that each toolbox must supply conversion tools and the situation is similar to the problems
faced with integrating data from two different packages.
