The language model or grammar of a recognition system deﬁnes the sequences of vocabulary items which
are  allowed.  For  simple  tasks,  deterministic  ﬁnite-state  grammars  can  be  used  to  deﬁne  all  allowable  word
sequences. Typically, however, recognizers make use of stochastic grammars based on n-gram statistics [Jelinek,
1985]. A  bigram  language  model,  for  example,  speciﬁes  the  probability  of  a  vocabulary  item  given  the  item
which precedes it.
