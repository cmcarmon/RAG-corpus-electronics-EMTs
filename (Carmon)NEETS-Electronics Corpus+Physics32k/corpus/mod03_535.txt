Figure 3-24 (E), (G) and (H) are open relays. The mechanical motion of the contacts can be observed
and the relays are easily available for maintenance. Figure 3-24 (A), (B) and (C) are semisealed relays.
The covers provide protection from dust, moisture, and other foreign material but can be removed for
maintenance.
