Radio was mysterious not only to the layman, but also to many engineers and technically informed
individuals.  The  mystery  lay  largely  in  radio’s  application  of  principles  and  phenomena  only  recently
identiﬁed  by  physicists  and  engineers  working  at  the  frontiers  of  their  specialties.  The  existence  of
electromagnetic waves that traveled like light had been predicted by the brilliant physicist James Clerk
Maxwell in the 1860s and proven by the young German Heinrich Hertz in the 1880s. The possible use
of  these  waves  for  communicating  through  space  without  wires  occurred  to  many;  however,  the  ﬁrst
practical  steps  to  making  radio  useful  are  generally  attributed  to  Oliver  Lodge  in  England,  Guglielmo
Marconi in Italy, and Aleksandr Popov in Russia. Marconi’s broadcast of Morse code across the Atlantic
in 1901 ﬁrst showed the world just what enormous potential radio had for changing the whole concept
of  long-distance  communication.  The  next  few  years  saw  feverish  activity  everywhere  as  men  tried  to
translate the achievements of the pioneers into the foundations of a practical technology.
