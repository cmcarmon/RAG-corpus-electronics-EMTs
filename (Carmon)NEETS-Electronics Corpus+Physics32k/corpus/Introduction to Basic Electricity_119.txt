The	direction	of	a	magnetic	field	dictates	the	direction	of	the	current	in	a
circuit
The	electric	current	of	a	conductor	creates	a		magnetic	field;	the	formation
is	dependent	on	the	direction	of	the	conductor,	but	is	always	shaped	in	a
corresponding	circle
The	magnetic	poles	of	charged	elements	always	come	in	pairs;	one	pole	in
a	pair	needs	to	be	inversely	proportional	to	the	other
Charged	elements	can	either	attract	or	repel;	elements	with	different
charges	are	attractive	to	each	other,	while	those	with	similar	charges	avoid
contact
Electric	current	can	be	induced	when	it	is	moved	away	or	toward	a
magnetic	field
