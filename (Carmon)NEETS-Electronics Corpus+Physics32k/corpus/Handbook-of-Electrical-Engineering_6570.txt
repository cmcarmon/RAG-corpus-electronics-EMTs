Total  cable  capacity  is  also  increased  by  placing  numerous  ﬁbers  inside  the  cable.  This  is  a  cost-effective
strategy when installing long ﬁber cables. The added cost of the extra ﬁbers is small compared to the costs of
actually deploying the cable itself. Fiber counts above 100 are practical. Multiﬁber cables can have enormous
total data capacities.
