Common applications of rare-earth magnets include:
computer hard disk drives
wind turbine generators
audio speakers / headphones
bicycle dynamos
Magnetic resonance imaging devices
fishing reel brakes
permanent magnet motors in cordless tools
high-performance AC servo motors
traction motors and integrated starter-generators in hybrid and electric vehicles
mechanically powered flashlights, employing rare earth magnets for generating electricity in a shaking motion or rotating (hand-crank-powered) motion
industrial uses such as maintaining product purity, equipment protection, and quality control
capture of fine metallic particles in lubricating oils (crankcases of internal combustion engines, also gearboxes and differentials), so as to keep said particles out of circulation, thereby rendering them unable to cause abrasive wear of moving machine parts
