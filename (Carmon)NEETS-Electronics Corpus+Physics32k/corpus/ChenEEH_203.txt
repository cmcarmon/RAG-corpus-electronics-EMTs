As in the case of a linear circuit, Kirchhoff ’s voltage and
current laws and Telegen’s theorem are valid for nonlinear
circuits. They deal only with a circuit’s topology (the manner
in which the circuit elements are connected together). Kirch-
hoff ’s voltage and current laws express linear relationships
