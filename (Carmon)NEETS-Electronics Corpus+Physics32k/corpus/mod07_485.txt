Figure 4-29 shows an LC capacitor-input filter and associated waveforms. Both half-wave and 
full-wave rectifier circuits are used to provide the input. The waveforms shown in view A of the figure 
represent the unfiltered output from a typical rectifier circuit. Note that the average value of output 
voltage (Eavg), indicated by the dashed lines, for the half-wave rectifier is less than half the amplitude of 
the voltage peaks. The average value of output voltage (Eavg) for the full-wave rectifier is greater than 
half, but is still much less than the peak amplitude of the rectifier-output waveform. With no filter 
connected across the output of the rectifier circuit (which results in unfiltered output voltage), the 
waveform has a large value of pulsating component (ripple) as compared to the average (or dc) 
component.
