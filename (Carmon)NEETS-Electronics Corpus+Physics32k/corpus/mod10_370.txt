distances are possible because of the different densities and refractive qualities of warm and cool air. The 
sudden change in density when a radio wave enters the warm air above a duct causes the wave to be 
refracted back toward Earth. When the wave strikes the Earth or a warm layer below the duct, it is again 
reflected or refracted upward and proceeds on through the duct with a multiple-hop type of action. An 
example of the propagation of radio waves by ducting is shown in figure 2-25.
