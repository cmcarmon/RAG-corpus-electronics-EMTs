Series RC circuits are widely used for coupling signals from one stage to another. If the time 
constant of the coupling circuit is comparatively long, the shape of the output waveform will be almost 
identical to that of the input. However, the output dc reference level may be different from that of the 
input. Figure 4-17, view (A), shows a typical RC coupling circuit in which the output reference level has 
been changed to 0 volts. In this circuit, the values of R1 and C1 are chosen so that the capacitor will 
charge (during T0 to T1) to 20 percent of the applied voltage, as shown in view (B). With this in mind, 
let's consider the operation of the circuit.
