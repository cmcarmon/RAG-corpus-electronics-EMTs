The input to the circuit is a voltage source (VIN), applied differentially to the ampliﬁer. The output will be
taken differentially across the collectors of the two upper transistors at nodes 2 and 3. The input impedance
of the ampliﬁer can be calculated as VIN/I(VIN) or because VIN = 1.0 just as 1/I(VIN). These quantities are
shown plotted using PROBE in Fig. 13.6. It can be seen that the gain of the ampliﬁer falls off at high frequency
