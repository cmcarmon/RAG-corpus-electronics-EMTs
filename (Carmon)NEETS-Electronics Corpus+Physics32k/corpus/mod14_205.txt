To reach a logical conclusion, you must assume the qualifying statement is a condition of truth. For
each statement there is also a corresponding false condition. The statement "USS Lincoln is a Navy ship"
is true; therefore, the statement "USS Lincoln is not a Navy ship" is false. There are no in-between
conditions.
