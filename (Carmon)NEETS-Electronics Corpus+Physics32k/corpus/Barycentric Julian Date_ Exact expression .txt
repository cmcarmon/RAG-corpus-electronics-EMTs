{\displaystyle BJD_{TT}=JD_{TT}+{\frac {|{\vec {r}}+d\,{\hat {n}}|-d}{c}}}

where






r

{\displaystyle {\vec {r}}}
is the vector from the barycentre to the observer,






n
^





{\displaystyle {\hat {n}}}
is the unit vector from the observer to the object or event,



d


{\displaystyle d}
is the distance from the observer to the observed object or event, and



c


{\displaystyle c}
is the speed of light.
This expression should be used for objects within the Solar System.
