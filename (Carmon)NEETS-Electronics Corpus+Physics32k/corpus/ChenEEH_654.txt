RNS Signal Activity for Gaussian Input
The bit activity in an RNS architecture with positionally en-
coded residues has been experimentally studied for the encod-
ing of 8-bit data using the base {2, 151}, which provides
a linear ﬁxed-point dynamic range of approximately 8.24 bits.
Assuming data sampled from a Gaussian process,
the
bit assertion activities of the particular RNS, an 8-bit sign-
magnitude, and an 8-bit two’s-complement system are meas-
ured and compared. The results are depicted in Figure 1.8 for 100
