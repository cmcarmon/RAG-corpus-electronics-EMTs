This equation is identical in form to that of an RLC resonator (see Equation
12.119), but this circuit contains no inductors. The effect of an inductor is
created by an active element,
in this case the Op Amp, and the capacitors,
hence the name RC active filter. The advantages of an RC active filter (this is
only one realization; there are many others) are that it can provide a power
gain unlike an RLC network and that it does not require inductors. Because
inductors are difficult to fabricate in VLSI technology, this is an important design
advantage for integrated circuits. Furthermore,
inductors are not very ideal
elements, especially for low-frequency applications (for example, for frequencies
below perhaps 100 kHz). Thus in this frequency range, resonant circuits are
often built out of Op Amps, resistors, and capacitors.
