5.8 DFT: Computational Complexity19
We now have a way of computing the spectrum for an arbitrary signal: The Discrete Fourier Transform
(DFT) (5.33) computes the spectrum at N equally spaced frequencies from a length- N sequence. An issue
that never arises in analog “computation,” like that performed by a circuit, is how much work it takes to
perform the signal processing operation such as ﬁltering. In computation, this consideration translates to
the number of basic computational steps required to perform the needed processing. The number of steps,
known as the complexity, becomes equivalent to how long the computation takes (how long must we wait
for an answer). Complexity is not so much tied to speciﬁc computers or programming languages but to how
many steps are required on any computer. Thus, a procedure’s stated complexity says that the time taken
will be proportional to some function of the amount of data used in the computation and the amount
demanded.
