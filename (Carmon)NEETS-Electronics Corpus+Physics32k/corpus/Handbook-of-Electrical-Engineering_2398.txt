It is of course required that –1/2 < α < 1/2, but this range of α covers Q = 0 to ∞. For example, a ratio Q =
4.8 gives a value α ≈ 0.25, and then f ≈ 0.83. Thus, the ratio must be fairly large before ρ is appreciably reduced.
It  is  useful  to  further  average ρ  by  including  the  remaining  two  contact  permutations,  and  also  reversing
