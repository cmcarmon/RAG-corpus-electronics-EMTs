p r o b l e m 10.29 Consider the digital memory element shown in Figure 10.131.
The voltage at the storage node with respect to ground is denoted vM. The figure also
shows a parasitic resistance RP from the storage node to ground. This resistance will
cause a leakage of the charge stored in the memory.
