For 30 years the evolution of the ECG proceeded when F. N. Wilson [1934] added concepts of a “unipolar”
recording. He created a reference point by tying the three limbs together and averaging their potentials so that
individual recording sites on the limbs or chest surface would be differentially recorded with the same reference
point. Wilson extended the biophysical models to include the concept of the cardiac source enclosed within
the volume conductor of the body. He erroneously thought that the central terminal was a true zero potential.
However, from the mid-1930s until today the 12 leads composed of the three limb leads, three leads in which
the limb potentials are referenced to a modiﬁed Wilson terminal (the augmented leads [Goldberger, 1942]),
and six leads placed across the front of the chest and referenced to the Wilson terminal form the basis of the
standard 12-lead ECG. Figure 115.5 summarizes the 12-lead set. These sites are historically based, have a built
in redundancy, and are not optimal for all cardiac events. The voltage difference from any two sites will record
an ECG, but it is these standardized sites with the massive 90-year collection of empirical observations that has
ﬁrmly established their role as the standard. Figure 115.6 is a typical or stylized ECG recording from lead II.
Einthoven  chose  the  letters  of  the  alphabet  from  P  to  U  to  label  the  waves  and  to  avoid  conﬂict  with  other
physiologic waves being studied at the turn of the century. The ECG signals are typically in the range of –2
mV and require a recording bandwidth of 0.05–150 Hz. Full technical speciﬁcation for ECG equipment has
been proposed by both the American Heart Association [1984] and the Association for the Advancement of
Medical Instrumentation [Bailey et al., 1990].
