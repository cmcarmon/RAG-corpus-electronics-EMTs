The database content can be viewed in self-contained, pre-defined pathways. The database can also dynamically generate interaction networks to visualize the results of database searches. Pathways and dynamically generated networks are displayed in GIF and SVG images and can be downloaded as XML (including the standard pathway interchange format, BioPAX). The entire database is also available for download.
