These conditions are used when we donâ€™t know the exact details of flow distribution but boundary values of pressure are known
For example: external flows around objects, internal flows with multiple outlets, buoyancy-driven flows, free surface flows, etc.
The pressure corrections are taken zero at the nodes.
