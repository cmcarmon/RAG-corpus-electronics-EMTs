A subset Gi of the edges of a given graph G is called a subgraph of G. If Gi does not contain all of the edges
of  G,  it  is  a  proper subgraph  of  G. A  path  is  a  subgraph  having  all  vertices  of  degree  2  except  for  the  two
endpoints, which are of degree 1 and are called the terminals of the path. The set of all edges in a path constitutes
a path-set. If the two terminals of a path coincide, the path is a closed path and is called a circuit (or loop).
The set of all edges contained in a circuit is called a circuit-set (or loop-set).
