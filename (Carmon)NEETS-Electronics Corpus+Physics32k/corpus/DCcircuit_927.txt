Resistors R1 and R3 are of equal resistance value, and the strain gauges are identical to
one another. With no applied force, the bridge should be in a perfectly balanced condition
and the voltmeter should register 0 volts. Both gauges are bonded to the same test specimen,
but only one is placed in a position and orientation so as to be exposed to physical strain
(the active gauge). The other gauge is isolated from all mechanical stress, and acts merely as
a temperature compensation device (the ”dummy” gauge). If the temperature changes, both
gauge resistances will change by the same percentage, and the bridge’s state of balance will
remain unaffected. Only a differential resistance (difference of resistance between the two
strain gauges) produced by physical force on the test specimen can alter the balance of the
bridge.
