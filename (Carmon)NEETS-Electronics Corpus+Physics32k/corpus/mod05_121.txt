Assume that a very large turning force is required to rotate a heavy object, such as an antenna, to a 
very precise position. A low-power, relatively weak voltage representing the amount of antenna rotation 
required can be used to control the field winding of an amplidyne. Because of the amplidyne's ability to 
amplify, its output can be used to drive a powerful motor, which turns the heavy object (antenna). When 
the source of the input voltage senses the correct movement of the object, it drops the voltage to zero. The 
field is no longer strong enough to allow an output voltage to be developed, so the motor ceases to drive 
the object (antenna).
