One of the most useful ﬁgures for an ampliﬁer is the trans-
ducer gain, which is the ratio of the power delivered to the
load to the power delivered by the source and depends on
the input and output match. In terms of the gain coefﬁcients,
the transducer gain is GT ¼ GSG0GL. In terms of reﬂection
coefﬁcients, the transducer gain is given as:
