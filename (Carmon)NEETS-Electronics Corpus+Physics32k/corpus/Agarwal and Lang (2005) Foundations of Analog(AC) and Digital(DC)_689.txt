Value discretization forms the basis of the digital abstraction. The idea is to lump
signal values that fall within some interval into a single value. We saw an example
of value discretization earlier in Figure 1.45 (repeated here for convenience
as Figure 5.1) where a voltage signal was discretized into two levels. In this
example, an observed voltage value between 0 volts and 2.5 volts is treated as
a ‘‘0,’’ and a value between 2.5 volts and 5 volts as a ‘‘1.’’ Correspondingly, to
transmit the logical value ‘‘0’’ over a wire, we place the nominal voltage level
of 1.25 on the wire. Similarly, to transmit the logical ‘‘1,’’ we place the nominal
voltage level of 3.75 volts on the wire.1 The discrete signal shown in Figure 5.1
comprises the sequence of values ‘‘0,’’ ‘‘1,’’ ‘‘0,’’ ‘‘1,’’ ‘‘0.’’
