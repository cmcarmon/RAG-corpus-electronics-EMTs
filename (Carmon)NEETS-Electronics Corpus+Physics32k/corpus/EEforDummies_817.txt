Even after you remove your AC adapter from your wall power, you’ll still 
find a DC voltage across the output leads for quite a while because there is 
a large capacitor inside the housing that is holding its charge. The capacitor 
will eventually discharge, but it could take hours. To discharge the capacitor 
quickly, use your insulated needle-nose pliers to grip a 680 Ω resistor, care-
fully maneuver the pliers to place the resistor’s leads across the AC adapter’s 
output leads, and wait about 30 seconds.
