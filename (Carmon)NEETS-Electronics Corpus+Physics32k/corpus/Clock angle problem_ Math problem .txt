Clock angle problems relate two different measurements: angles and time. The angle is typically measured in degrees from the mark of number 12 clockwise. The time is usually based on 12-hour clock.
A method to solve such problems is to consider the rate of change of the angle in degrees per minute. The hour hand of a normal 12-hour analogue clock turns 360째 in 12 hours (720 minutes) or 0.5째 per minute. The minute hand rotates through 360째 in 60 minutes or 6째 per minute.
