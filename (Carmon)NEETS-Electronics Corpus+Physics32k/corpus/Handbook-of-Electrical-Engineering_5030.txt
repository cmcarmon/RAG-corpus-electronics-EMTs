Most  of  the  mica  used  in  electrical  applications  is  of  the  muscovite  [KAl2(OH)2Si3AlO10]  type.  Mica  is  a
layer-type  dielectric,  and  mica  Ô¨Ålms  are  obtained  by  the  splitting  of  mica  blocks.  The  extended  two-dimen-
sionally  layered  strata  of  mica  prevent  the  formation  of  conductive  pathways  across  the  mica,  resulting  in  a
high dielectric strength. It has excellent thermal stability and due to its inorganic nature is highly resistant to
partial  discharges.  It  is  used  in  sheet,  plate,  and  tape  form  in  rotating  machines  and  transformer  coils.  For
example, a mica-epoxy composite is employed in stator bar insulation of rotating machines.
