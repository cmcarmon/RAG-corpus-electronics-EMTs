Simply, quiescent describes circuit conditions when the tube is not amplifying. The tube has no
output signal and is in a kind of standby, waiting condition. Now letâ€™s go on to figure 1-19. With no input
signal, under quiescent conditions, assume that 1 milliampere of current flows through the tube, cathode
to plate. This current (Ip) will flow through RL (load resistor) to the positive terminal of the battery. The
current flowing through RL  causes a voltage drop (IR) across RL equal to:
