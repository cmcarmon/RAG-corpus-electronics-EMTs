shown in figure 1-24(C). The range of the meter is now 10 milliamperes and it is possible to read the
meter indication of 5 milliamperes with the greatest degree of accuracy. Since the current indicated is
equal to (or greater than) the next range of the ammeter (5 milliamperes), the meter should NOT be
switched to the next range.
