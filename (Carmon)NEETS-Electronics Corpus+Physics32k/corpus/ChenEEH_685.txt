The results show that the option of embedding logic on a
DRAM process leads to a reduced power cost and an increased
bandwidth between the central DRAM and the rest of the
system. This is indeed true for applications where the increased
processing cost is allowed (Wehn et al., 1998). It is a one-time
drop, however after which the widening energy-delay gap
between the storage and the logic will keep on progressing
due to the unavoidable evolution of the relative interconnect
contributions (see previous discussion).
