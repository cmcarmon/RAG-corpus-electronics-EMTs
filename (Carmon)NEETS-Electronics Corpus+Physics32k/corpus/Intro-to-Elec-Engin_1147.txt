An induction motor has a starting current that is 6 times the full-load current and a per-unit full-
load slip of 0.04. The machine is to be provided with an autotransformer starter. If the minimum
starting torque must be 0.3 times the full-load torque, determine the required tapping on the
transformer and the per-unit supply-source line current at starting.
