The Hodgkinâ€“Huxley model can be thought of as a differential equation with four state variables, v(t), m(t), n(t), and h(t), that change with respect to time t. The system is difficult to study because it is a nonlinear system and cannot be solved analytically. However, there are many numeric methods available to analyze the system. Certain properties and general behaviors, such as limit cycles, can be proven to exist.
