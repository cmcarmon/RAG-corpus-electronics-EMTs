Some noise also exhibits a frequency dependence. If the
noise mean-square value of spectral components in a narrow
bandwidth (Df ) is determined, then the ratio of that value to
Df
is deﬁned as the noise power spectral density (the noise
mean-square per bandwidth). Mathematically, the deﬁnition
is expressed in terms of noise current as:
