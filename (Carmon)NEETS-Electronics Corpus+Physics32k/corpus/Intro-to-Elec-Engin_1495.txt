Figure 15.3.2 shows the output quantum levels versus input voltage characteristic (stairstep in
shape) of an L-level quantizer, when the message signal has both positive and negative amplitudes
of the same maximum magnitude. Case (a) corresponds to L being an even integer, when the
midriser can be observed; and case (b) corresponds to L being an odd integer, when the midtread
can be seen.
