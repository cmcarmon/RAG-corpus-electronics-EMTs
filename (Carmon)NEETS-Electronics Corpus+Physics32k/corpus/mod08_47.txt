Another example of the use of an amplifier is shown in figure 1-2. In a radio receiver, the signal 
picked up by the antenna is too weak (small) to be used as it is. This signal must be amplified before it is 
sent to the detector. (The detector separates the audio signal from the frequency that was sent by the 
transmitter. The way in which this is done will be discussed later in this training series.)
