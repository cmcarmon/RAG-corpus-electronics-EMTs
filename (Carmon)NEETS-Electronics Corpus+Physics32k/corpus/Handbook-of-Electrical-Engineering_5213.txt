The transmission of electrical energy over long distances and at increasingly higher voltages has become an
ever more important component as “open access” of these facilities becomes a reality. Chapter 63 will present
the theory of transmission, including alternating current and direct current transmission, both overhead and
underground. In addition, the discussion will include the protection of these facilities, transient operation, and
planning.
