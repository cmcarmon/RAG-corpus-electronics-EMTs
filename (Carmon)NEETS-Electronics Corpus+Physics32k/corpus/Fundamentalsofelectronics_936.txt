During the 1960s, it was becoming clear that not only was digital communication technically superior,
but also that the wide variety of communication modes—computer login, ﬁle transfer, and electronic mail—
needed a diﬀerent approach than point-to-point. The notion of computer networks was born then, and what
was then called the ARPANET, now called the Internet, was born. Computer networks elaborate the basic
network model by subdividing messages into smaller chunks called packets(Figure 6.26). The rationale for
the network enforcing smaller transmissions was that large ﬁle transfers would consume network resources
all along the route, and, because of the long transmission time, a communication failure might require
retransmission of the entire ﬁle. By creating packets, each of which has its own address and is routed
independently of others, the network can better manage congestion. The analogy is that the postal service,
rather than sending a long letter in the envelope you provide, opens the envelope, places each page in a
separate envelope, and using the address on your envelope, addresses each page’s envelope accordingly, and
