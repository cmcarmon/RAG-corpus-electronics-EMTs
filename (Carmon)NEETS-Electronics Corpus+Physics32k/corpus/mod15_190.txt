jumper between these terminals at the TR should not affect the circuit. If, however, the TR rotor moves 
when you connect a jumper, there is a slight voltage difference between S1 and S3. This voltage 
difference indicates that the transmitter is not on electrical zero. If this is the case, recheck the transmitter 
for electrical zero.
