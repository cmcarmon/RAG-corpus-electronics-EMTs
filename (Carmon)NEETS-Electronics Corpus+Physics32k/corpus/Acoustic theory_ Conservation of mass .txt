The equation for the conservation of mass in a fluid volume (without any mass sources or sinks) is given by







∂
ρ


∂
t



+
∇
⋅
(
ρ

u

)
=
0


{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial \rho }{\partial t}}+\nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf {u} )=0}

where



ρ
(

x

,
t
)


{\displaystyle \rho (\mathbf {x} ,t)}
is the mass density of the fluid and




u

(

x

,
t
)


{\displaystyle \mathbf {u} (\mathbf {x} ,t)}
is the flow velocity.
The equation for the conservation of mass for an acoustic medium can also be derived in a manner similar to that used for the conservation of momentum.
