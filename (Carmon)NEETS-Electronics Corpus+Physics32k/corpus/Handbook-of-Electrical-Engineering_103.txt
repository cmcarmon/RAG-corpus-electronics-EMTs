Foil  Tantalum  Capacitors.  Foil  tantalum  capacitors  can  be  designed  to
voltage  values  up  to  300  V  dc.  Of  the  three  types  of  tantalum  electrolytic
capacitors, the foil design has the lowest capacitance per unit volume and is
best suited for the higher voltages primarily found in older designs of equip-
ment. It is expensive and used only where neither a solid-electrolyte (Fig. 1.18)
nor a wet-slug (Fig. 1.19) tantalum capacitor can be employed.
