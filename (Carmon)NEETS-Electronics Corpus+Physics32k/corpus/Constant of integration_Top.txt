In calculus, the indefinite integral of a given function (i.e., the set of all antiderivatives of the function) on a connected domain is only defined up to an additive constant, the constant of integration. This constant expresses an ambiguity inherent in the construction of antiderivatives. If a function



f
(
x
)


{\displaystyle f(x)}
is defined on an interval and



F
(
x
)


{\displaystyle F(x)}
is an antiderivative of



f
(
x
)


{\displaystyle f(x)}
, then the set of all antiderivatives of



f
(
x
)


{\displaystyle f(x)}
is given by the functions



F
(
x
)
+
C


{\displaystyle F(x)+C}
, where C is an arbitrary constant (meaning that any value for C makes



F
(
x
)
+
C


{\displaystyle F(x)+C}
a valid antiderivative). The constant of integration is sometimes omitted in lists of integrals for simplicity.
