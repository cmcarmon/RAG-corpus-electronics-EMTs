The circuit shown in ﬁgure 5.8a is the basic common emitter ampliﬁer using the simplest
biasing method. Because it is constant, the power supply voltage VCC is an AC ground
indistinguishable from the normal ground of the circuit. We can therefore relocate the
upper end of RB and RC to the common ground line as shown in ﬁgure 5.8b. The transistor
symbol is ideal and hie is shown explicitly as the input impedance and hence iS (cid:13)= iB.
