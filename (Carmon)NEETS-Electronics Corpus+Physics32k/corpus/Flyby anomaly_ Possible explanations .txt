There have been a number of proposed explanations of the flyby anomaly, including:
Unaccounted transverse Doppler effect—i.e. the redshift of light source with zero radial and non-zero tangential velocity. However, this cannot explain the similar anomaly in the ranging data.
A dark-matter halo around Earth.
A modification of inertia resulting from a Hubble-scale Casimir effect, related to the Unruh effect (MiHsC),
The impact of general relativity, in its weak-field and linearized form yielding gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic phenomena like frame-dragging, has been investigated as well: it turns out to be unable to account for the flyby anomaly.
The classical time-retarded gravity explanation proposed by Joseph C. Hafele.
Range-proportional excess delay of the telemetry signal revealed by the United States Space Surveillance Network range data in the NEAR flyby. This delay, accounting for the anomaly in both Doppler and range data, as well as the trailing Doppler oscillations, to within 10–20%, points to chirp modes in the reception due to the Doppler rate, predicting a positive anomaly only when the tracking by DSN is interrupted around perigee, and zero or negative anomaly if tracked continuously. No anomaly should occur in Doppler tracked by non-DSN stations.

The action of a topological torsion current predicting flyby anomalies in retrograde direction, but null-effect when spacecrafts approach the planet in posigrade direction with respect to the planetary sense of rotation.
The analysis of the Juno flyby looked at analysis errors that could potentially mimic the flyby anomaly. They found that a high precision gravity field (at least 50x50 degree/order) was needed for accurate flyby predictions. Use of a lower precision gravity field (10x10 degree/order, sufficient for launch analysis), would yield a 4.5 mm/sec velocity error.
