In an a.c. circuit, a capacitor produces a reactance which causes the current to lead the voltage by 90 
degrees. Because the capacitor "reacts" to a changing voltage, it is known as a reactive component. The 
opposition a capacitor presents to a.c. is called capacitive reactance (XC). The opposition is caused by the 
capacitor "reacting" to the changing voltage of the a.c. source. The formula for capacitive reactance is:
