This means that both Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits should produce the same
voltage across the load terminals with no load resistor attached. With the Thevenin equivalent,
the open-circuited voltage would be equal to the Thevenin source voltage (no circuit current
present to drop voltage across the series resistor), which is 11.2 volts in this case. With the
Norton equivalent circuit, all 14 amps from the Norton current source would have to ﬂow
through the 0.8 Ω Norton resistance, producing the exact same voltage, 11.2 volts (E=IR).
Thus, we can say that the Thevenin voltage is equal to the Norton current times the Norton
resistance:
