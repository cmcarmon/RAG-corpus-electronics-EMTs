At T2, PS goes HIGH, CLR goes LOW, Q goes LOW, and Q  goes HIGH. At this point the FF is
CLEARED (line 3 of the Truth Table). The condition of the CLK, J, and K inputs have no effect on the
PS and CLR actions since these inputs override the other inputs. Starting at T3, PS and CLR will be held
at HIGHs so as not to override the other actions of the FF. Using the PS and CLR inputs only, the circuit
will function as an R-S FF.
