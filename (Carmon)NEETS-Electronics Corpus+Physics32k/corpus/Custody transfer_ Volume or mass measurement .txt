Liquid flow measurements are usually in volumetric or mass unit. Volume is normally used for stand-alone field tanker loading operations, while mass is used for multi-field pipeline or offshore pipeline with an allocation requirement.
Mass measurement and reporting are achieved by
Measurement of volume flow rate (for example, by turbine or ultrasonic meter) and fluid density
Direct mass measurement by Coriolis meter
