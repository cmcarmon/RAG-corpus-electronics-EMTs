The  ribbon  design  was  invented  at  AT&T  Bell  Laboratories  and  consists  of  a  linear  array  of  12  ﬁbers
sandwiched between two polyester tapes with pressure-sensitive adhesive on the ﬁber side. The spacing and the
back tension on the ﬁbers is accurately maintained. The ribbons are typically 2.5 mm in width. Up to 12 ribbons
can be stacked to give a cable core consisting of 144 ﬁbers. The core is twisted to some lay length and enclosed
in  a  polyethylene  tube.  Several  combinations  of  protective  plastic  and  metallic  layers  along  with  metallic  or
nonmetallic strength members are then applied around the core to give the ﬁnal cable its required mechanical
and environmental characteristics needed for use in speciﬁed conditions. The ribbon design offers the most
efﬁcient and economic packaging of ﬁbers for high-ﬁber-count cables. It also lends the cable to preconnector-
ization and makes it extremely convenient for installation and splicing.
