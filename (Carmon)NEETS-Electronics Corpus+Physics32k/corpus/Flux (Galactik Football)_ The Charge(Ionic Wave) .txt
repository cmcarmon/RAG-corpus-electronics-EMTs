Used by The Lightnings, from the planet Light.
Their Flux manifests as sparks of electricity, or streaks of white light tinted slightly blue. The players look like tall, well-built men, blue and slightly robotic in nature. The most common feature of their Flux is the ability to move at incredible speeds, literally streaking from one point to the other across the field.
In a match shown with them against the Shadows, the Charge seemed to be on par with the Smog's teleport ability, allowing the Lightnings to easily match them move for moves.
