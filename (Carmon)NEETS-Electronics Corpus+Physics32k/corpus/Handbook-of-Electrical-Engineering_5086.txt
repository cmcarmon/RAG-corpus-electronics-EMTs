Faraday Rotation or Magnetic Circular Birefringence
The  classic  Faraday  rotation  takes  place  in  a  cubic  or  isotropic  transparent  medium  where  the  propagation
direction  of  transmitted  light  is  parallel  to  the  direction  of  applied  magnetization  within  the  medium.  For
, the permittivity tensor
example, if the direction of magnetization and the propagation of light is taken as 
becomes (assuming second-order effect is insigniÔ¨Åcantly small):
