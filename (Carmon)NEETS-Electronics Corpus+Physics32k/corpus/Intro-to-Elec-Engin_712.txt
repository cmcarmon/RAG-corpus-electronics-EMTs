Assuming small vDS, ﬁnd the channel resistance
rDS for vGS = −2 V if the JFET’s parameters are
IDSS = 25 mA and VP = 3 V.
7.4.16 An n-channel enhancement MOSFET operates in
the active region with very large VA, vGS = 6 V,
VT = 4 V, and iD = 1 mA. Calculate K.
7.4.17 Consider the MOSFET circuit with variable volt-
age shown in Example 7.4.2, with RD = 2 k
and VDD = 12 V. The static characteristics of
the n-channel enhancement MOSFET are given
in Figure P7.4.17.
(a) Draw the load line and ﬁnd the operating point
if vGS = 4 V.
