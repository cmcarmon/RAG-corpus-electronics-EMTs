Classiﬁcation of Model Types
It is convenient to classify solution techniques for electromagnetic modeling in terms of the ﬁeld propagator
that might be used, the anticipated application, and the problem type for which the model is intended to be
used, as is outlined in Table 45.1. Selection of a ﬁeld propagator in the form, for example, of the Maxwell curl
equations, a Green’s function, modal or spectral expansions, or an optical description is a necessary ﬁrst step
in developing a solution to any electromagnetic problem.
