Modulation measurements are sometimes required during tuning procedures to adjust transmitting 
equipment for the proper amount of modulation. During maintenance tests of modulated transmitter 
equipment, you should determine the amount of distortion in the output signal and the modulation level or 
index. The modulation level in multiplexing equipment is usually set at the factory or during corrective 
maintenance procedures. Proper adjustment of the input signal level and automatic signal-level regulation 
circuits provides the correct amount of modulation. Defects in modulation circuits of a transmitter can be 
detected by measurements of the quality of the received signals at the receiver. Corrective maintenance 
analysis of multiplex equipment modulation circuits can usually be made by signal-level measurements.
