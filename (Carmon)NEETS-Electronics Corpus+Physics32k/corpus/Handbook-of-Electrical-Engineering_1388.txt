sequences  from  the  signal  and  noise  must  be  available  at  the  speech  enhancement  unit.  Furthermore,  these
training  sequences  must  be  applied  for  each  newly  observed  vector  of  the  noisy  signal.  Since  the  training
sequences are normally very long, the speech enhancement unit must have extensive memory and computational
resources. These problems are addressed in the model-based approach described next.
