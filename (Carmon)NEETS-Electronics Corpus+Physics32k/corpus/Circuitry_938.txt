where Ap, Av or Ai is the power, voltage or current 
gain (or loss) expressed in decibels, Pin and Pout are 
the  input  and  output  powers,  Vin  and  Vout  are  the 
input  and  output  voltages,  and  Iin  and  Iout  are  the 
input  and  output  currents.  Note,  again,  that  the 
powers, voltages or currents should be expressed in 
the  same  units/multiples  (e.g.  Pin  and  Pout  should 
both be expressed in W, mW, ÂµW or nW). 
 
It  is  worth  noting  that,  for  identical  decibel 
values,  the  values  of  voltage  and  current  gain  can 
be  found  by 
the 
corresponding value of power gain. As an example, 
a voltage gain of 20 dB results from a voltage ratio 
of 10 while a power gain of 20 dB corresponds to a 
power ratio of 100. 
  Finally,  it  is  essential  to  note  that  the  formulae 
for  voltage  and  current  gain  are  only  meaningful 
when 
impedances  (or 
resistances) are identical. Voltage and current gains 
expressed  in  decibels  are  thus  only  valid  for 
matched (constant impedance) systems. Table A7.1  
gives some useful decibel values.
