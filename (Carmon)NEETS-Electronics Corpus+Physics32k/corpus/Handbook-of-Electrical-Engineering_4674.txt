In SAW devices there are a number of effects which can distort the desired response from the ideal response.
The  most  signiﬁcant  distortion  in  SAW  transducers  is  called  the  triple  transit  echo  (TTE)  which  causes  a
delayed signal in time and an inband ripple in the amplitude and delay of the ﬁlter. The TTE is primarily due
to an electrically regenerated SAW at the output transducer which travels back to the input transducer, where
it  induces  a  voltage  across  the  electrodes  which  in  turn  regenerates  another  SAW  which  arrives  back  at  the
output transducer. This is illustrated schematically in Fig. 47.2. Properly designed and matched unidirectional
transducers have acceptably low levels of TTE due to their design. Bidirectional transducers, however, must
be  mismatched  in  order  to  achieve  acceptable  TTE  levels.  To  ﬁrst  order,  the  TTE  for  a  bidirectional  two-
transducer ﬁlter is given as
