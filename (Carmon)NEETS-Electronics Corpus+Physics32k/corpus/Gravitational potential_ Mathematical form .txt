The potential V of a unit mass m at a distance x from a point mass of mass M can be defined as the work W that needs to be done by an external agent to bring the unit mass in from infinity to that point:

where G is the gravitational constant, and F is the gravitational force. The potential has units of energy per unit mass, e.g., J/kg in the MKS system. By convention, it is always negative where it is defined, and as x tends to infinity, it approaches zero.
The gravitational field, and thus the acceleration of a small body in the space around the massive object, is the negative gradient of the gravitational potential. Thus the negative of a negative gradient yields positive acceleration toward a massive object. Because the potential has no angular components, its gradient is

The potential associated with a mass distribution is the superposition of the potentials of point masses. If the mass distribution is a finite collection of point masses, and if the point masses are located at the points x1, ..., xn and have masses m1, ..., mn, then the potential of the distribution at the point x is

{\displaystyle V(\mathbf {x} )=\sum _{i=1}^{n}-{\frac {Gm_{i}}{|\mathbf {x} -\mathbf {x_{i}} |}}.}


If the mass distribution is given as a mass measure dm on three-dimensional Euclidean space R3, then the potential is the convolution of ‚àíG/|r| with dm. In good cases this equals the integral

{\displaystyle V(\mathbf {x} )=-\int _{\mathbf {R} ^{3}}{\frac {G}{|\mathbf {x} -\mathbf {r} |}}\,dm(\mathbf {r} ),}

where |x ‚àí r| is the distance between the points x and r. If there is a function œÅ(r) representing the density of the distribution at r, so that dm(r)= œÅ(r)dv(r), where dv(r) is the Euclidean volume element, then the gravitational potential is the volume integral

If V is a potential function coming from a continuous mass distribution œÅ(r), then œÅ can be recovered using the Laplace operator, Œî:

{\displaystyle \rho (\mathbf {x} )={\frac {1}{4\pi G}}\Delta V(\mathbf {x} ).}

This holds pointwise whenever œÅ is continuous and is zero outside of a bounded set. In general, the mass measure dm can be recovered in the same way if the Laplace operator is taken in the sense of distributions. As a consequence, the gravitational potential satisfies Poisson's equation. See also Green's function for the three-variable Laplace equation and Newtonian potential.
The integral may be expressed in terms of known transcendental functions for all ellipsoidal shapes, including the symmetrical and degenerate ones. These include the sphere, where the three semiaxes are equal; the oblate (see reference ellipsoid) and prolate spheroids, where two semiaxes are equal; the degenerate ones where one semiaxis is infinite (the elliptical and circular cylinder) and the unbounded sheet where two semiaxes are infinite. All these shapes are widely used in the applications of the gravitational potential integral (apart from the constant G, with ùúå being a constant charge density) to electromagnetism.
