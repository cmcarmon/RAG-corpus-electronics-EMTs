Varactor  multipliers  offer  the  best  frequency  multiplier  performance.  Varactor  multipliers  (pulsed)  have
achieved  power  output  in  excess  of  100  and  10  W  at  4  and  10  GHz,  respectively  [Bahl  and  Bhartia,  1988].
Table 43.4 shows the best performance measured in the millimeter wave range and above.
