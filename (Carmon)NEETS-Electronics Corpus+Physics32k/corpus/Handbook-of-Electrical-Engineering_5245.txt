Coal-ﬁred power plants generate a signiﬁcant amount of ash. The disposition of the ash causes environmental
problems. Several systems have been developed in past decades. Large ash particles are collected by a water-
ﬁlled ash hopper, located at the bottom of the furnace. Fly ash is removed by ﬁlters, then mixed with water.
Both  systems  produce  sludge  that  is  pumped  to  a  clay-lined  pond  where  water  evaporates  and  the  ash  ﬁlls
disposal sites. The clay lining prevents intrusion of groundwater into the pond.
