In the second stage, the (time-varying) masking threshold as determined by the psychoacoustic model usually
controls an iterative analysis-by-synthesis quantization and coding loop. It can incorporate rules for masking
of tones by noise and of noise by tones, though little is known in the psychoacoustic literature for more general
signals. Quantizer step sizes can be set and bits can be allocated according to the known spectral estimate, by
block companding with transmission of the scale factors as side information or iteratively in a variable-length
coding loop (Huffman coding). In the latter case, one can low-pass Ô¨Ålter the signal if the total required bit rate
is too high.
