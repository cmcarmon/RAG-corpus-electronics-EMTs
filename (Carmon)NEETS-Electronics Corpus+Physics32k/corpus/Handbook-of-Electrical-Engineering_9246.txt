Several  categories  of  specialized  tools  have  recently  become  available  for  software  projects.  Many  CASE
(computer-aided  software  engineering)  tool  suites  have  integral  support  for  both  producing  and  verifying
structural descriptions of software applications. There are also tools that can automatically generate test cases
from speciÔ¨Åcations and tools that can trace test cases back to the original requirements. While such tools do
not fully eliminate errors of commission, they do provide welcome assistance.
