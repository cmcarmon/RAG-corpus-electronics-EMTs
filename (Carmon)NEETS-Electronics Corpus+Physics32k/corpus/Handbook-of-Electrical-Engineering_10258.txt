Because of the intrinsic ï¬‚exibility of electronic displays, a major issue is the design of display formats. Care
must  be  taken  not  to  place  too  much  information  in  the  display  and  to  ensure  that  the  information  is
comprehendible in high workload (aircraft emergency or combat) situations.
