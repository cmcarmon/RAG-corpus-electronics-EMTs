In his next attempt, De Forest decided to change the element between the cathode and the plate.
Instead of a solid metal plate, he used a wire mesh. This would allow electrons to flow from the cathode,
THROUGH THE WIRE MESH, to the plate. This tube circuit is shown in figure 1-15. In view (A) you
see De Forestâ€™s circuit with 0 volts applied to the third element, (today called a control grid or
occasionally just the grid). Under these conditions, assume that the ammeter reads 5 milliamperes. With
no voltage applied to the grid, the grid has little effect on the electron stream. For all practical purposes,
the control grid is not there. Most electrons flow through the open mesh. The tube functions as a diode.
