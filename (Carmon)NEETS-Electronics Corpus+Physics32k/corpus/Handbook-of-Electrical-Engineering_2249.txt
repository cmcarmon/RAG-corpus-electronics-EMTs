For \w  < Eg [i.e., for l  > lc = 1.24 mm/Eg (eV) – cutoff wavelength] band-to-band transitions do not occur,
but light can be absorbed by a variety of the so-called subgap processes. These processes include the absorption
by free carriers, formation of excitons (bound electron–hole pairs whose formation requires less energy than
the creation of a free electron and a free hole), transitions involving localized states (e.g., from an acceptor state
to the conduction band), and phonon absorption. Both band-to-band and subgap processes may be responsible
for the increase of the free charge carriers concentration. The resulting reduction of the resistivity of illuminated
semiconductors is called photoconductivity and is used in photodetectors.
