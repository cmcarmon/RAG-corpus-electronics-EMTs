A corona is the phenomenon of air breakdown when the
electric stress at the surface of a conductor exceeds a certain
value. At higher values, the stress results in luminous dis-
charge. Corona produces undesirable effects like radio and
television interference, ozone, audible noise, and power loss.
The use of grading rings on dead-end towers is a common
practice to reduce corona. When nonceramic insulators
are used, the use of corona rings at the terminals of the
insulators is a common practice for voltages above 230 kV.
These along with ceramic or glass insulators are normally
not used.
