Samoa uses UTC+13:00 as standard time and UTC+14:00 as daylight saving time, which it observes during summer in the Southern Hemisphere. In 2011, daylight saving time ended on Saturday 2 April 2011, 04:00 local daylight time and started on Sunday 24 September 2011, 03:00 local standard time. Due to its location in the South Pacific Ocean, Samoa traditionally did not observe daylight saving time. Initially planned for 2009, the introduction of daylight saving time in Samoa was postponed for one year due to the aftermath of the 2009 Samoa tsunami.
Being located just west of the International Date Line, Samoa is among the first places on earth to see each new day, along with Tonga, Tokelau (during Standard Time) and parts of Kiribati.
