Next, by grounding the left terminal of R1, let us make vb = 0. With respect to the voltage on
terminal 2, note that the circuit is that of a noninverting ampliÔ¨Åer with gain 1 + R2/R1. The
voltage divider, consisting of R3 and R4, corresponds to a gain of R4/(R3 + R4) from the input to
terminal 2. Thus the overall gain becomes
wa =
