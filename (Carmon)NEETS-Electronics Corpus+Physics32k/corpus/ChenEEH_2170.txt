. Diamagnetic materials have a small negative wm so that
mr91 as shown in Table 1.3. All materials are diamagnetic
to some extent although this behavior may be superceded
by a more dominant effect, such as ferromagnetism. Dia-
magnetism is a classical (versus quantum mechanical)
effect produced by moving charges. The induced magnet-
ization M is opposed to the applied B, thus reducing the
