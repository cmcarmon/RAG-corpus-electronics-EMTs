A satellite in a circular orbit from approximately 2,000 miles to 12,000 miles above the earth is 
considered to be in a MEDIUM ALTITUDE ORBIT. The period of a medium altitude satellite is 
considerably less than that of the earth. When you look at this altitude satellite, it appears to move rather 
quickly across the sky from west to east.
