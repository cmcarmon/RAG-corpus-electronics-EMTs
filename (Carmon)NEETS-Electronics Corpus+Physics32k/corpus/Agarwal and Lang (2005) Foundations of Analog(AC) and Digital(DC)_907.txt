a) Draw the input versus output voltage transfer curve for the inverter.
b) Does the inverter satisfy the static discipline for the voltage thresholds VOL = 1
V, VIL = 1.5 V, VOH = 4 V and VIH = 3 V? Explain. (Hint: To satisfy the
static discipline, the inverter must interpret correctly input values that are valid logic
signals. Furthermore, given valid logic inputs, the inverter must also output valid
logic signals. Valid logic 0 input signals are represented by voltages less than VIL,
valid logic 1 input signals are represented by voltages greater than VIH, valid logic 0
output signals are represented by voltages less than VOL, and valid logic 1 output
signals are represented by voltages greater than VOH.)
