Velocity Filtering
Combination of individual sensor outputs in a more sophisticated way than the delay-and-sum technique leads
to  the  design  of  multichannel  velocity  ﬁlters  for  linear  and  planar  as  well  as  spatial  arrays.  Consider,  ﬁrst,  a
linear (1-D) array of sensors, which will be used to implement velocity discrimination. The pass and rejection
zones are deﬁned by straight lines in the (k1,w)-plane, where
