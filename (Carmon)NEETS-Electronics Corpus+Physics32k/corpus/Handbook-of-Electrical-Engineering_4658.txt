multiphase ﬁlter synthesis which do not have inband, interelectrode reﬂections. As is the case for most tech-
nologies, many models may be used in conjunction with each other for predicting device performance based
on ease of synthesis, conﬁdence in predicted parameters, and correlation with experimental device data.
