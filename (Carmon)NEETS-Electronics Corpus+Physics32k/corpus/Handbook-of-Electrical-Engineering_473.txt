g Parameters:
h Parameters:
Hybrid (inverse hybrid) parameters: That set of two-port parameters, such as h(g) parameters, where input
current (voltage) and output voltage (current) are the independent variables. The parenthetical expres-
sions refer to the inverse hybrid parameters. See Table 3.2 for speciﬁc deﬁnitions.
