The horizontal width of the curve is a measure of how well the circuit will pick out (discriminate) the 
one desired frequency. The width is called BANDWIDTH, and the ability to discriminate between 
frequencies is known as SELECTIVITY. Both of these characteristics are affected by resistance. Lower 
resistance allows narrower bandwidth, which is the same as saying the circuit has better selectivity. 
Resistance, then, is an unwanted quantity that cannot be eliminated but can be kept to a minimum by the 
circuit designers.
