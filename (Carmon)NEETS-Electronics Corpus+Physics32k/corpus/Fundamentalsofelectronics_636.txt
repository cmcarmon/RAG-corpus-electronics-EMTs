aside: There is an asymmetry in the coeﬃcients: where is a0? This coeﬃcient would multiply the
y (n) term in (5.42). We have essentially divided the equation by it, which does not change the
input-output relationship. We have thus created the convention that a0 is always one.
As opposed to diﬀerential equations, which only provide an implicit description of a system (we must
somehow solve the diﬀerential equation), diﬀerence equations provide an explicit way of computing the
output for any input. We simply express the diﬀerence equation by a program that calculates each output
from the previous output values, and the current and previous inputs.
