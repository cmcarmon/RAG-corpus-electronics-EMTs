When the coil is energized by a current with a frequency between 55 and 65 hertz, all the reeds are
vibrated slightly; but, the reed having a natural frequency closest to that of the energizing current vibrates
through a larger amplitude. The frequency is read from the scale value opposite the reed having the
greatest amplitude of vibration.
