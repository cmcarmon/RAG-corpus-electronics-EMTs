The differential cross section can be derived from the equations of motion for a particle interacting with a central potential. In general, the equations of motion describing two particles interacting under a central force can be decoupled into the center of mass and the motion of the particles relative to one another. For the case of light alpha particles scattering off heavy nuclei, as in the experiment performed by Rutherford, the reduced mass is essentially the mass of the alpha particle and the nucleus off of which it scatters is essentially stationary in the lab frame.
Substituting into the Binet equation yields the equation of trajectory

incident intensity





{\displaystyle {\frac {d\sigma }{d\Omega }}(\Omega )d\Omega ={\frac {{\hbox{number of particles scattered into solid angle }}d\Omega {\hbox{ per unit time}}}{\hbox{incident intensity}}}}

Since the scattering angle is uniquely determined for a given E and b, the number of particles scattered into an angle between Θ and Θ + dΘ must be the same as the number of particles with associated impact parameters between b and b + db. For an incident intensity I, this implies the following equality
