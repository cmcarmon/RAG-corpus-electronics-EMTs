In a minor branch of the above reaction, occurring in the Sun's core 0.04% of the time, the final reaction involving 157N shown above does not produce carbon-12 and an alpha particle, but instead produces oxygen-16 and a photon and continues 157N→168O→179F→178O→147N→158O→157N:

Like the carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen involved in the main branch, the fluorine produced in the minor branch is merely an intermediate product and at steady state, does not accumulate in the star.
