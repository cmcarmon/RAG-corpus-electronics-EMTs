The basic idea behind lag network design is to reduce the gain at “middle” frequencies such as to reduce the
crossover frequency to a lower value than for the uncompensated system. If the phase lag is less at this lower
frequency, then the PM will be increased by use of the lag network. We have seen that is not possible to use a
lag network in situations in which there is not a frequency where an acceptable PM would exist if this frequency
were  the  crossover  frequency.  Even  if  use  of  a  lag  network  is  possible,  the  signiﬁcantly  reduced  crossover
frequency resulting from its use may make the system so slow and sluggish in response to an input that system
performance is unacceptable even though the relative stability of the system is acceptable.
