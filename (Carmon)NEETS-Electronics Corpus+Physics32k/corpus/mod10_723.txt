bi-directional system is illustrated in figure 4-29. View A shows radiation along the array axis in a plane 
perpendicular to the dipoles, and view B shows radiation along the array axis in the plane of the elements. 
These patterns were developed with a 180-degree phase difference between the elements. Additional 
elements introduce small, minor lobes.
