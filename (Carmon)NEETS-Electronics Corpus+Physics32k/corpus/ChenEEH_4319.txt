1970s and written in Fortran. The name originated from the
term matrix laboratory. The examples are generated using
Version 5.3 (release 11), and the same vectors and matrices
are carried throughout this chapter. MATLAB is a powerful
problem-solving environment with many built-in debugging
tools. It can generate world-class graphics that can be imported
to almost any Ô¨Åle format for inclusion in reports and presen-
tations. As the reader will no doubt observe, MATLAB is
quickly assimilable; with a little knowledge of history and
intuition, actual MATLAB commands are easy to identify.
