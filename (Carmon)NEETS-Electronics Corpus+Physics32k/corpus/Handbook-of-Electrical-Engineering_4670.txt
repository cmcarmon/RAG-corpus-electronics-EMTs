The frequency response is the summation of the individual frequency responses in each track, which may be
widely varying depending on the required impulse response. This spatial weighting complicates the calculations
of the equivalent circuit for the transducer. Each track must be evaluated separately for its acoustic conductance,
acoustic  capacitance,  and  acoustic  susceptance.  The  transducer  elements  are  then  obtained  by  summing  the
individual  track  values  yielding  the  Ô¨Ånal  transducer  equivalent  circuit  parameters.  These  parameters  can  be
solved analytically for simple impulse response shapes (such as the rect, triangle, cosine, etc.) but are usually
solved numerically on a computer [Richie et al., 1988].
