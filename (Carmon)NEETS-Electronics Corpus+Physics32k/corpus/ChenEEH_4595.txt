analysis and theorem, the successful control mission can still
be achieved provided sufﬁcient online computational power
and the satisfaction of the necessary and sufﬁcient conditions.
In other words, a substantial amount of computational cost
may be paid for maintaining the control mission. In many real
systems,
the failures could be well-known or anticipated
according to the history of system behavior and/or the aging
degree of the system components. For those known and/or
expected faults, it is apparently not necessary to waste the
computational source for failure accommodation. Those fault
patterns or signatures and the corresponding control actions
can be developed off-line and prestored in a database for an
online control purpose. The appropriate online failure accom-
modation actions are then suggested by a fault detection and
diagnosis scheme that detects and identiﬁes the failure patterns
online. This idea has been adopted in many (interactive)
multiple model-based FTC research works (Maybeck and
Stevens, 1991; Zhang and Li, 1998; Zhang and Jiang, 1999;
Laparo et al., 1991).
