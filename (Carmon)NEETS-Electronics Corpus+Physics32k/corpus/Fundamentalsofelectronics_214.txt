• For frequencies below this frequency, the circuit does not much alter the amplitude of the complex
• For frequencies greater than fc, the circuit strongly attenuates the amplitude. Thus, when the source
frequency is in this range, the circuit’s output has a much smaller amplitude than that of the source.
For these reasons, this frequency is known as the cutoﬀ frequency. In this circuit the cutoﬀ frequency
