professional rate) requires a data stream of 1.536 megabits/s to transmit a stereo program in a serial format.
This output represents a bandwidth of approximately 1.5 MHz, much greater than that used by an equivalent
analog audio modulating signal [Smyth, 1992]. Source encoders can reduce the data rate by factors of 8:1 or
more, yielding a much more efÔ¨Åcient modulating signal.
