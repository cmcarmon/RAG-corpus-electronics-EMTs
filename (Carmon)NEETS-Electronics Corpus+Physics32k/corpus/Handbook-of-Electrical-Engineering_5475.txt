AC Current Harmonics
The HVDC converter is a harmonic current source on the ac side. Fourier analysis of an ac current waveform,
shown in Fig. 61.14, shows that it contains the fundamental and harmonics of the order 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19,
etc. The current for zero degree overlap angle can be expressed as
