At ﬁrst it appears that we have lost any advantage of measuring resistance this way, be-
cause the voltmeter now has to measure voltage through a long pair of (resistive) wires, intro-
ducing stray resistance back into the measuring circuit again. However, upon closer inspection
it is seen that nothing is lost at all, because the voltmeter’s wires carry miniscule current.
