13. To ‘assert’ is to set the value to a logical 1, while to ‘de-assert’ is to set the value to a logical 0.
14. Our circuit shown in Figure 10.51 has one other problem. How do the lights turn off? It
should be apparent from the circuit that L will go back to 0 when motion is detected during the
daytime. However, relying on the appearance of signal M during the daytime to turn off the lights is
unappealing. One solution is to modify our memory abstraction to include a reset signal as follows:
The value in memory is set to 0 when the reset input is high. (Our memory abstraction can include
the additional property that the reset signal overrides the store signal if both are on at the same
time.) Our motion detector circuit output L can now be turned off by asserting the reset signal of
the memory. The reset terminal of memory can be connected to the signal D so that the memory
contents and therefore the lights go off whenever it is day.
