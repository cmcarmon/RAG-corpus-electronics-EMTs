Several countries in ITU Region 1 have access to frequencies in the 70 MHz region, called the 4 meters band. The band shares many propagation characteristics with 6 meters. The preferred location for beacons is 70,000  to 70,090 kHz; however, in countries where this segment is not allocated to Amateur Radio, beacons may operate elsewhere in the band.
