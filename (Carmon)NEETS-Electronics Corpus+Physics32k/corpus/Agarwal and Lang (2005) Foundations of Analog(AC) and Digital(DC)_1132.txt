Notice that because 1/K(VGS − VT) is a constant, vds is directly proportional to ids,
which is a resistor relationship. Remarkably, a MOSFET with its gate and drain terminals
connected behaves like a resistor with resistance 1/K(VGS − VT) to small signals.
The small-signal equivalent circuit for the preceding element is shown in Figure 8.13.
Because of its resistive behavior for small signals, and because MOSFETs with a high
resistance are easier to fabricate than resistors, MOSFETs are commonly used as the
load resistor in amplifiers.
