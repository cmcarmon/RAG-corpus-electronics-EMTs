Whether or not a current flows depends on which way you apply the volt­
age. If you connect the positive terminal of a battery to the P‐type material 
and the negative terminal to the N‐type material, current will flow (as long as 
the applied voltage exceeds a certain minimum and doesn’t exceed a certain 
maximum). But if you reverse the battery, current will not flow (unless you 
apply a very large voltage).
