Transformation of power from one voltage level to another is a vital operation in any transmission, distri-
bution,  and  utilization  network.  Normally,  power  is  generated  at  a  voltage  that  takes  into  consideration  the
cost of generators in relation to their operating voltage. Generated power is transmitted by overhead lines many
miles and undergoes several voltage transformations before it is made available to the actual user. Figure 1.22
shows a typical power ï¬‚ow line diagram.
