identify ESD-sensitive (ESDS) devices by the symbols shown in figure 2-5. Static electricity is created
whenever two substances (solid or fluid) are rubbed together or separated. The rubbing or separating of
substances causes the transfer of electrons from one substance to the other; one substance then becomes
positively charged, and the other becomes negatively charged. When either of these charged substances
comes in contact with a grounded conductor, an electrical current flows until that substance is at the same
electrical potential as ground.
