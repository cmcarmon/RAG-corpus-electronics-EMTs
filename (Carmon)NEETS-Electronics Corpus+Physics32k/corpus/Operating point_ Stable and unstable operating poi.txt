Also in case of an unstable operating point the law of the balance of the torques is always valid. But when the operating point is unstable then the characteristics of drive and machine are nearly parallel. In such a case a small change in torque will result in a big change of speed. In practice no device has a characteristics which is so thin that the intersection point can be clearly expected. Because of parallel characteristics, inner and outer friction as well as mechanical imperfections the unstable operating point is rather a band of possible operating states instead of a point. Running at an unstable operating point is therefore undesirable.
The middle point on the curve in the third picture on the right is an unstable point, too. However the above-mentioned assumptions are not valid here. Torque and speed are the same but in case the speed will be increased only little then the torque of the drive will be much higher than the counter-torque of the machine. The same but vice versa applies when reducing the speed. For this reason this operating point does not have a stabilizing effect on the speed. The speed will run away to the left or the right side of the point and the drive will run stable there.
