Follow figure 3-33 as we study the shorted line. At the odd quarter-wavelength points, the voltage is
high, the current is low, and the impedance is high. Since these conditions are similar to those found in a
parallel-resonant circuit, the shorted transmission line acts as a parallel-resonant circuit at these lengths.
