This relation tells us that in one Dt , a numerical value can
propagate at most one D. This is intuitively correct given the
local nature of the spatial differences used in the Yee algorithm.
That is, a ﬁeld point more than one D away from a source
point that undergoes a sudden change cannot possibly ‘‘feel’’
the effect of that change during the next Dt. Note that ~vvp, max is
independent of material parameters and is an inherent prop-
erty of the grid and its method of obtaining space derivatives.
