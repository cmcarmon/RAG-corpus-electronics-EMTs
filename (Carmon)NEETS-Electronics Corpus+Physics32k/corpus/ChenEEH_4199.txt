This section describes the local area network (LAN) and
metropolitan area network (MAN) technologies. The dra-
matic and continuing decrease in computer hardware cost
and an increase in computer capability have increased the
usage of single-function systems or workstations. One has
the desire to interconnect these single function systems and
workstations together for variety reasons. The major reasons
are to exchange data between systems, to share expensive
resources, to improve the performance for real-time applica-
tions, and to improve the productivity of the employees.
