The equilibrium xe ¼ 0 of equation 2.5 is stable if all eigen-
values of A have nonpositive real parts and if every eigenvalue
of A that has a zero real part is a simple zero of the character-
istic polynomial of A.
The equilibrium xe ¼ 0 of equation 2.5 is asymptotically
stable if and only if all eigenvalues of A have negative real parts.
A real n  n matrix A is called stable or a Hurwitz matrix if
all of its eigenvalues have negative real parts. If at least one of
the eigenvalues has a positive real part, then A is called un-
stable.
Thus, the equilibrium xe ¼ 0 of equation 2.5 is asymptotic-
ally stable if and only if A is stable. If A is unstable, then xe ¼ 0
is unstable.
