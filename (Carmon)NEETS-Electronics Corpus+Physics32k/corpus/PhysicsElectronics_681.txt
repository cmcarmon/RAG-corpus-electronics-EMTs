The op-amp performance can be demonstrated by applying a step function to the input
and observing the output response, as shown in ﬁgure 6.33b. The actual output will have
a ﬁnite slope (slew rate) and overshoot the ﬁnal voltage value. It then approaches the ﬁnal
voltage either exponentially or with some damped ringing. The slew rate and overshoot are
nonlinear eﬀects. The settling time after ampliﬁer saturation is deﬁned as the time between
the edge of the applied step function and the point where the ampliﬁer output settles to
within some stated percentage of the target voltage value.
