Passively powered telemeters offer some interesting advantages. When a number of telemeters are used, they
can be powered in sequence or only when measurements are required, thus preventing radio frequency con-
gestion. In medical applications of telemetry, passive devices eliminate the danger involved in swallowing or
implanting batteries.
