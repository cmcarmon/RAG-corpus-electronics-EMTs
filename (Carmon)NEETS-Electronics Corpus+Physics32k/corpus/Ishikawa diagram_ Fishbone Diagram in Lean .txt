A recurring theme in a lean or six-sigma transformation is removing the clutter to allow you to see waste or opportunities for improvement. A fishbone diagram aims to break down and organise the Causes of an issue to reveal what elements have the greatest impact. Grouping the “causes” means you can think about the different elements of the problem as separate from the overall process. One or two of these “causes” will have a greater effect than the others and will guide you to the root of the problem. This structure also allows you to tackle smaller chunks which have a large impact on the problem. Looking at elements of the problem and not the whole process will likely make finding your solution less daunting and problem solving more manageable.
After you have determined your root cause, prioritise or screen the causes to determine which are having the largest effect. Once identified focus on these. An easy Cause screening method involves looking at each one and asking two questions
How likely is this cause to be the major source of the issue or variation?
V- Very Likely
S- Somewhat Likely
N- Not Likely
How easy would it be to fix or control?
V- Very Easy
S- Somewhat Easy
N- Not Easy
Put the answers of the two questions together. Work on the Cause which have a result of VV, VS and SV.
