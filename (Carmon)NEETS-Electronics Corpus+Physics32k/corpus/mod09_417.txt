The BLOCKING OSCILLATOR is a special type of wave generator used to produce a narrow pulse, 
or trigger. Blocking oscillators have many uses, most of which are concerned with the timing of some 
other circuit. They can be used as frequency dividers or counter circuits and for switching other circuits 
on and off at specific times.
