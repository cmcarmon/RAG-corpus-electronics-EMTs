v
s=
L
where  Vs
resistance of the inductor, and L is the inductance. 
  The  inductor  voltage  will  fall  to  approximately 
37%  of  the  initial  voltage  in  a  time  equal  to  the 
time constant.  
  At  the  end  of  the  next  interval  of  time  equal  to 
the time constant (i.e. after a total time of 2L/R has 
elapsed)  the  voltage  will  have  fallen  by  a  further 
37% of the remainder, and so on. 
 
Example 3.15 
 
A coil having inductance 6 H and resistance 24 F is 
connected  to  a  12  V  d.c.  supply.  Determine  the 
current in the inductor 0.1 s after the supply is first 
connected. 
 
Solution 
 
The  formula  for  exponential  growth  of  current  in 
the coil is:
