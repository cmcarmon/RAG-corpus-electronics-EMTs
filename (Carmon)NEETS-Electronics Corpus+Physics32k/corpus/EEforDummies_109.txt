Computing
In much the same way that the ancients used the abacus to perform arithme-
tic operations, so you use electronic calculators and computers to perform 
computations. With the abacus, beads were used to represent numbers, and 
calculations were performed by manipulating those beads. In computing 
systems, patterns of stored electrical energy are used to represent numbers, 
letters, and other information, and computations are performed by manipu-
lating those patterns using electronic components. (Of course, the worker‚Äê
bee electrons inside have no idea that they are crunching numbers!) The 
result of a computation is stored as a new pattern of electrical energy and 
often directed to special circuits designed to display the result on a monitor 
or other screen.
