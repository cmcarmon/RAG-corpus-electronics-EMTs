Pulsar planets are planets orbiting pulsars, and several have been discovered using pulsar timing. The radial velocity variations of the pulsar follow from the varying intervals between the arrival times of the pulses. The first exoplanets were discovered this way in 1992 around the millisecond pulsar PSR 1257+12. Another example is PSR J1719-1438, a millisecond pulsar whose companion, PSR J1719-1438 b, has a minimum mass approximate equal to the mass of Jupiter, according to the mass function.
