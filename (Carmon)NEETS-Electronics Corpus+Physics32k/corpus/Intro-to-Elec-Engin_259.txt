The student is encouraged to justify this statement by drawing graphically. For determining the
response of a circuit to a pulse excitation, using the principle of superposition, the response to each
component can be found and the circuit response obtained by summing the component responses.
The decomposition of pulse-type waveforms into a number of step functions is commonly used.
In order to represent the effects of pulses of short duration and the responses they produce,
