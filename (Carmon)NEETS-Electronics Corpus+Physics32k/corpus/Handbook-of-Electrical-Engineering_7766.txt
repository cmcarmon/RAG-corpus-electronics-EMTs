A cheap storage medium is the magnetic cassette. Based on the audio cassette, this uses the normal audio
cassette recorder for reading and writing data via the standard Kansas City interface through a serial computer
I/O  line.  A  logic  data “1”  is  recorded  by  a  high  frequency  and  a  logic  data “0”  by  a  lower  frequency.  High-
density  cassettes  can  store  up  to  60  Mbytes  of  data  on  each  tape  and  are  popular  with  the  computer  games
market as a cheap storage medium for program distribution.
