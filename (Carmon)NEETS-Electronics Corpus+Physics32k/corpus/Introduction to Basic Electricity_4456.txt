The flip-flop belongs to a category of digital circuits 
called multivibrators. A multivibrator is a regenerative 
circuit with two active devices. It is designed so that 
one device conducts while the other device is cut off. 
Multivibrators can store binary numbers, count pulses, 
synchronize arithmetic operations, and perform other 
essential functions in digital systems.
