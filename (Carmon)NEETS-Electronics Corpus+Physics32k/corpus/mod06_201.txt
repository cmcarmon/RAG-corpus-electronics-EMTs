Remember that every cathode is able to emit just so many electrons. When that maximum number is
being emitted, the tube is said to be at SATURATION or PLATE SATURATION. Saturation is reached
in a triode when the voltages on the grid and plate combine to draw all the electrons from the space
charge.
