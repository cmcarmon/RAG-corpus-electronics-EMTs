A zener  diode  may  usually  be  tested  in  the  same 
manner as is a general-purpose diode. If it tests the 
same  as  does  a  general-purpose  diode,  it  is 
probably good. However, the most rapid method of 
checking  a  zener  diode  is  to  apply  power  to  the 
circuit it is used in and measure the voltage across 
it.  If  this  voltage  reading  is  the  correct  zener 
voltage (as rated by the manufacturer), the zener is 
good.  If  the  voltage  across  the  zener  is  incorrect, 
either the supply to the zener is low, or not present, 
or the zener itself has failed. 
  Typical  meter  indications  for  silicon  diodes  are 
shown in Fig. 15.7 (forward bias is applied in Fig. 
15.7(a) and reverse bias is applied in Fig. 15.7(b)) . 
Corresponding  indications  for  germanium  diodes  
will  be  somewhat  lower  than  those  shown  for 
silicon diodes. 
  Encapsulated  bridge  rectifiers  are  supplied  with 
all  four  diode  connections  accessible.  It  is  thus 
possible  to  check  each  individual  diode  for  both 
forward and reverse resistance.  It is also possible 
to check that the bridge as a whole is neither short-
circuited nor open-circuited.
