The input offset voltage is also called the input bias voltage or the input
operating voltage. The corresponding output voltage and the output current
define the output operating point of the amplifier. Together, the input bias
voltage, and the corresponding output voltage and the output current, define
the operating point of the amplifier. We denote the operating point values of
vIN, vO, and iD as VIN, VO, and ID, respectively. As illustrated in Figure 7.41,
