Problem 4.24: AM Stereo
A stereophonic signal consists of a “left” signal l (t) and a “right” signal r (t) that conveys sounds coming from
an orchestra’s left and right sides, respectively. To transmit these two signals simultaneously, the transmitter
ﬁrst forms the sum signal s+ (t) = l (t) + r (t) and the diﬀerence signal s− (t) = l (t) − r (t). Then, the
transmitter amplitude-modulates the diﬀerence signal with a sinusoid having frequency 2W , where W is the
bandwidth of the left and right signals. The sum signal and the modulated diﬀerence signal are added, the
sum amplitude-modulated to the radio station’s carrier frequency fc, and transmitted. Assume the spectra
of the left and right signals are as shown in Figure 4.32.
