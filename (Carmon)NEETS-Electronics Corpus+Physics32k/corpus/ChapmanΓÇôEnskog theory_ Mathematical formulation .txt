{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial f}{\partial t}}+\mathbf {v} \cdot {\frac {\partial f}{\partial \mathbf {x} }}+\mathbf {F} \cdot {\frac {\partial f}{\partial \mathbf {p} }}=B(f\otimes f),}

where f is the probability density function, t is the time, x is the position, v the velocity, p the momentum, F the force and B represents the binary collision term. The collision term is usually some correlation function of f, so it involves an integral where f appears twice in the integrand, albeit at different positions or momenta. The collision term is nonlinear, which makes it difficult to solve this equation. The Chapman–Enskog theory is a way to linearize the Boltzmann equation using a perturbation expansion for f for some small parameter
