f) Write an expression for the fall time of the buffer for the circuit configuration shown
in Figure 10.94c. (Hint: Refer to the sketch of vC from part (e.) The fall time of the
buffer is the time vC requires to transition from VS to VL from the time the input
vA makes a step transition from VS to 0 V. Note that the fall time of the buffer is
the sum of two components: (1) the internal buffer rise delay, or the time vB takes
to transition from its lowest voltage to VT and (2) the additional time vC takes to
transition from VS to VL.)
