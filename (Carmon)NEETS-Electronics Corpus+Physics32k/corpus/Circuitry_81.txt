BS 1852 coding 
 
Some  types  of  resistor  have  markings  based  on  a 
system of coding defined in BS 1852. This system 
involves marking the position of the decimal point 
with a letter to indicate the multiplier concerned as 
shown  in  Table  2.2.  A  further  letter  is  then 
appended  to  indicate  the  tolerance  as  shown  in 
Table 2.3.
