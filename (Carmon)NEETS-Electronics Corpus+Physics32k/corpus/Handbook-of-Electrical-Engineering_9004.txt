Figure  89.23 Light  is  used  to  selectively  discharge  the  photoconductor.  Electron-hole  pairs  are  photogenerated  in  the
charge-generation layer, followed by charge transport under a dc bias Ô¨Åeld and then selective neutralization of the surface
charges, thereby creating an electrostatic image.
