Since the cfa operates in a manner so similar to the magnetron, the detailed theory is not presented in 
this module. Detailed information of cfa operation is available in NAVSHIPS 0967-443-2230, Handling, 
Installation and Operation of Crossed-Field Amplifiers. As mentioned earlier, crossed-field amplifiers are 
commonly called Amplitrons. You should note, however, that Amplitron is a trademark of the Raytheon 
Manufacturing Company for the Raytheon line of crossed-field amplifiers. An illustration of a crossed-
field amplifier is shown in figure 2-38.
