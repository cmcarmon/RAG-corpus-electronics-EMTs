During forward conduction the power loss in the diode can become excessive for large current ﬂow. Schottky
diodes have an inherently lower turn-on voltage than  pn -junction diodes and are therefore more desirable in
applications where the energy losses in the diodes are signiﬁcant (such as output rectiﬁers in switching power
supplies). Other considerations such as recovery characteristics from forward conduction to reverse blocking
