Conversely, when the store signal goes low, the switch turns off (see
Figure 10.56). Consequently, the dOUT terminal of the capacitor begins to float
and the charge previously deposited on the capacitor is held in place. Thus, for
example, if a high voltage had been previously stored on the capacitor, a high
voltage will appear at the capacitor terminal dOUT even after the store signal
goes low. In the ideal case, if the resistance between the dOUT terminal and
ground is infinite, the capacitor will hold the charge forever.
