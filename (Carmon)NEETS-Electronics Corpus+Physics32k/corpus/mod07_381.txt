The FIELD-EFFECT TRANSISTOR combines the high input impedance of the vacuum tube with 
all the other advantages of the transistor. The elements of the FET are the gate, source, and drain, which 
are comparable to the base, emitter, and collector of a standard transistor. The JFET or "junction FET" is 
made of a solid bar of either P- or N-semiconductor material, and the gate is made of the opposite type 
material, as illustrated below. The FET is called P-channel or N-channel depending upon the type of 
material used to make the bar between the source and drain. Voltage applied to the gate controls the width 
of the channel and consequently controls the current flow from the source to the drain. The JFET is 
normally operated with reverse bias that controls the channel width by increasing or decreasing the 
depletion region.
