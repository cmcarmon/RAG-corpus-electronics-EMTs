Capacitor C1 and resistor R2 determine the fre-
quency of oscillation. By making resistor R2 variable, 
the frequency can be adjusted. If resistor R2 offers high 
resistance, a long RC time constant results, producing 
a low frequency of oscillation. If resistor R2 offers low 
resistance, a short RC time constant results, producing 
a high frequency of oscillation.
