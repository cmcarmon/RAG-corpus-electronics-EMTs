The modulator charging impedance, shown in figure 2-7, prevents the dc power supply from
becoming short-circuited when the modulator switch closes. When the modulator switch is open, the
charging impedance also controls the rate at which the storage element charges. When the charging
impedance is small, the storage element charges rapidly.
