A simple Taylor–Couette flow is a steady flow created between two rotating infinitely long coaxial cylinders. Since the cylinder lengths are infinitely long, the flow is essentially unidirectional in steady state. If the inner cylinder with radii

{\displaystyle R_{1}}
is rotating at constant angular velocity

{\displaystyle \Omega _{1}}
and the outer cylinder with radii

{\displaystyle R_{2}}
