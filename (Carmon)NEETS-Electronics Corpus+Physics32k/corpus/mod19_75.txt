Blood is circulated throughout the body by means of three different kinds of blood vessels: arteries, 
veins, and capillaries. Arteries are large vessels that carry the blood away from the heart; veins are large 
vessels that carry the blood back to the heart; and capillaries form a connecting network of smaller vessels 
between the arteries and the veins.
