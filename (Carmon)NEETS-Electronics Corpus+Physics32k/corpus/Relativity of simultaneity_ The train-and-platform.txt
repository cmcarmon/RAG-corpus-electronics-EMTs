A popular picture for understanding this idea is provided by a thought experiment similar to those suggested by Daniel Frost Comstock in 1910 and Einstein in 1917. It consists of one observer midway inside a speeding traincar and another observer standing on a platform as the train moves past. It is
A flash of light is given off at the center of the traincar just as the two observers pass each other. For the observer on board the train the front and back of the traincar are at fixed distances from the source of light and as such, according to this observer, the light will reach the front and back of the traincar at the same time.
For the observer standing on the platform, on the other hand, the rear of the traincar is moving (catching up) toward the point at which the flash was given off, and the front of the traincar is moving away from it. As the speed of light is finite and the same in all directions for all observers, the light headed for the back of the train will have less distance to cover than the light headed for the front. Thus, the flashes of light will strike the ends of the traincar at different times.
