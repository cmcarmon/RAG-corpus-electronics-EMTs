This resonator has large coupling to the external circuit. The coupling can be reduced and photolithographically
controlled  by  introducing  a  gap  as  shown  in  Fig. 39.6(d)  for  a  microstrip  gap-coupled  transmission  line
reï¬‚ection  resonator.  The  Q  of  a  resonator  can  be  dramatically  increased  by  using  a  high  dielectric  constant
material as shown in Fig. 39.6(e) for a dielectric transmission resonator in microstrip. One simple application
of a cavity resonator is the waveguide wavemeter [Fig. 39.6(h)]. Here the resonant frequency of a rectangular
cavity is varied by changing the physical dimensions of the cavity with a null of the detector indicating that
the frequency corresponds to the resonant cavity frequency.
