Most of the cards can be classiﬁed into ﬁve groups by the type of technologies used: microﬁlm, magnetic
strip, softstrip, chip, and laser/optical. Microﬁlm is hard to change and can be damaged by both temperature
and humidity. Magnetic strip contains little information, approximately 2K, and can be destroyed by electric
and magnetic ﬁelds. The softstrip, because it is laser printed and optically read, is difﬁcult to change information
on. The chip card has only up to 10K of storage and is very expensive. Finally, the laser/optical card allows for
approximately 1000 typed pages or approximately 4 Mb of memory and requires a read/write device.
