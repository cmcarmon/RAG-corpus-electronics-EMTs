Inside a potentiometer is a resis­
tance track with connections at 
both ends and a wiper that moves 
along the track. (See Figure 5­12.) 
Each end of the resistance track is 
electrically connected to one of the 
two end terminals on the outside of 
the pot, which is why the resistance 
between the two end terminals is 
fixed and equal to the maximum 
value of the pot.
