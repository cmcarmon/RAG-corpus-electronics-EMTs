In a diode that is forward biased, the negative ter-
minal of the external voltage source is connected to 
the N material, and the positive terminal is connected 
to the P material. If these terminals are reversed, the 
diode does not conduct and is said to be connected 
in reverse bias (Figure 29-4). In this configura-
tion, the free electrons in the N material are attracted 
toward the positive terminal of the external voltage 
source. This increases the number of positive ions 
in the area of the P–N junction, which increases the 
width of the depletion region on the N side of the 
junction. Electrons also leave the negative terminal 
of the voltage source and enter the P material. These 
electrons fill holes near the P–N junction, causing the  
holes to move toward the negative terminal, which 
 increases the width of the depletion region on the 
P side of the junction. The overall effect is that the 
depletion region is wider than in an unbiased or 
 forward-biased diode.
