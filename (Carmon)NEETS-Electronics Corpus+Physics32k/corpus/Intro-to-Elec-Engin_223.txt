Figure 3.1.1 Voltage and current relationships in time domain and frequency domain for elements R, L,
and C. (a) Current is in phase with voltage in a purely resistive circuit (unity power factor). (b) Current lags
voltage by 90° with a pure inductor (zero power factor lagging). (c) Current leads voltage by 90° with a pure
capacitor (zero power factor leading).
