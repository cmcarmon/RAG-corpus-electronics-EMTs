In a time-multiplexed system, the problem of “folded data” is present whenever the rate of data change is
faster than one-half the sampling rate. When this occurs, it is not known whether the measured quantity has
reversed itself several times between samples or if there has been no reversal at all. It is considered desirable to
limit  the  bandwidth  of  the  data  so  that  this  ambiguity  is  not  present;  however,  with  reﬁned  techniques  of
analysis, this is not a rigid requirement. The form in which the data is displayed or recorded is also a limitation
on measurement. In general, time-history plots of the measured quantity are desired. In this case, the speed at
which  the  recording  medium  moves  is  often  a  severe  limitation.  If  sampling  is  not  regular,  demultiplexing
difﬁculties are magniﬁed.
