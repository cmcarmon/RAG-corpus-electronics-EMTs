(Comment: Circuits of this type are now commonly used in a type of MOS integrated
circuit to make elements that simulate resistors with precisely controlled values. The
value of such elements is that precise control of capacitor sizes and clock frequencies is
easy in MOS integrated circuits, but precise control of resistor values is hard.)
