In other words, the generation dispatch becomes optimal when
the incremental generation costs ICi become equal at all the
generators. Since the generation cost Ci is a quadratic function
of Pi, the incremental cost ICi
is a linear function of Pi.
Therefore, the optimality problem reduces to solving N þ 1
linear equations 8.1 and 8.2 stated above in terms of N þ 1
unknown variables P1 through PN and l. The unique solution
is easily solved as:
