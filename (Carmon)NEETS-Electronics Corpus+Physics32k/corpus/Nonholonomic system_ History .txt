N. M. Ferrers first suggested to extend the equations of motion with nonholonomic constraints in 1871. He introduced the expressions for Cartesian velocities in terms of generalized velocities. In 1877, E. Routh wrote the equations with the Lagrange multipliers. In the third edition of his book for linear non-holonomic constraints of rigid bodies, he introduced the form with multipliers, which is now called the Lagrange equations of the second kind with multipliers. The terms the holonomic and nonholonomic systems were introduced by Heinrich Hertz in 1894. In 1897, S. A. Chaplygin first suggested to form the equations of motion without Lagrange multipliers. Under certain linear equations of constraint, he discriminated in the left-hand side of equations of motion the group of extra terms of the type of the Lagrange operator. The remaining extra terms characterize the nonholonomicity of system and they go to zeros when the given constrains are integrable. In 1901 P. V.Voronets generalized Chaplygin's work to the cases of noncyclic holonomic coordinates and of nonstationary constraints.
