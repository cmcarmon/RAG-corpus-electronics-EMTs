Isotopes with extremely long half-lives can be used to study multi-million year processes, such as tectonics and extreme climate change. The isotopic ratio of strontium (half-life ~2 Ma) can be analyzed within ice cores to examine changes over the earth’s lifetime. Differences in this ratio within the ice core would indicate significant alterations in the earth’s geochemistry.
