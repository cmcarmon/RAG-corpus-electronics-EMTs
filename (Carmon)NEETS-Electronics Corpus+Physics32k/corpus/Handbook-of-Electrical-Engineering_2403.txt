Sources of Error
Contact Size and Placement Effects
Much  has  been  written  about  this  subject  over  the  past  few  decades  [Look,  1989].  Indeed,  it  is  possible  to
calculate errors due to contact size and placement for any of the structures shown in Fig. 22.35. For (a), (c),
and (e), great care is necessary, while for (b), (d), and (f), large or misplaced contacts are not nearly as much
of a problem. In general, a good rule of thumb is to keep contact size, and distance from the periphery, each
below 10% of the smallest sample-edge dimension. For Hall-bar structures (a) and (b), in which the contacts
cover the ends, the ratio ᐉ/w > 3 should be maintained.
