As can be seen from Table 86.10, the RC system provides for one unique representation of zero because the
complementation constant  C =  rn falls outside the range. There are two representations of zero in the DRC
system, xe = 0 and  rn – 1. The RC representation is not symmetrical, and it is not a closed system under the
change of sign operation. The range for RC is [–1⁄2r n, 1⁄2r n – 1]. The DC is symmetrical and has the range of
[–(1⁄2r n  – 1), 1⁄2r n – 1].
