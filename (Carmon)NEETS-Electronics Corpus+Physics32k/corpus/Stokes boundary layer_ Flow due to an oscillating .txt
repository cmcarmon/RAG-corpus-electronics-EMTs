The case for an oscillating far-field flow, with the plate held at rest, can easily be constructed from the previous solution for an oscillating plate by using linear superposition of solutions. Consider a uniform velocity oscillation u∞:

{\displaystyle u_{\infty }(z,t)=U_{0}\,\cos \left(\Omega \,t\right),\,}

which satisfies the flow equations for the Stokes boundary layer, provided it is driven by a pressure gradient

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial p_{2}}{\partial x}}=\rho \,\Omega \,U_{0}\,\sin \left(\Omega \,t\right).}

Subtracting the solution u1( z, t ) from u∞( z, t ) gives the desired solution for an oscillating flow near a rigid wall at rest:

{\displaystyle u_{2}(z,t)=U_{0}\,{\Bigl [}\,\cos \left(\Omega \,t\right)\,-\,{\text{e}}^{-\kappa \,z}\,\cos \left(\Omega \,t\,-\,\kappa \,z\right)\,{\Bigr ]},}

which is zero at the wall z = 0, corresponding with the no-slip condition for a wall at rest. Further the velocity u2 oscillates with amplitude U0 far away from the wall, z → ∞. This situation is often encountered in sound waves near a solid wall, or for the fluid motion near the sea bed in water waves.
The vorticity, for the oscillating flow near a wall at rest, is equal to the vorticity in case of an oscillating plate but of opposite sign: ω2 = − ω1.
