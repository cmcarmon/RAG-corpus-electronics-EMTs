Block Diagrams
The mathematical relationships of control systems are usually represented by block diagrams,
which show the role of various components of the system and the interaction of variables in it.
It is common to use a block diagram in which each component in the system (or sometimes a
group of components) is represented by a block. An entire system may, then, be represented by the
interconnection of the blocks of the individual elements, so that their contributions to the overall
performance of the system may be evaluated. The simple conﬁguration shown in Figure 3.4.11
is actually the basic building block of a complex block diagram. In the case of linear systems,
the input–output relationship is expressed as a transfer function, which is the ratio of the Laplace
transform of the output to the Laplace transform of the input with initial conditions of the system
set to zero. The arrows on the diagram imply that the block diagram has a unilateral property. In
other words, signal can only pass in the direction of the arrows.
