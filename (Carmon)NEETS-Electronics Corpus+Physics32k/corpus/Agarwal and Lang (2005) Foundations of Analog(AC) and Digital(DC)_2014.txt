The previous section determined the total response of a parallel RLC circuit
for a sinusoidal input by solving its differential equation, which tended to be a
fairly grungy calculation. But as noted previously, we tend to be more inter-
ested in the steady-state response of circuits to sinusoidal inputs. As introduced
in Chapter 13, plotting the frequency response is a convenient way of visu-
alizing how the circuit responds in the steady state to sinusoids of various
frequencies. The frequency response of a network is examined by plotting two
