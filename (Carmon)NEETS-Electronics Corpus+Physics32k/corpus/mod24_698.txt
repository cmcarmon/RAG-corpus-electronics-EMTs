SUPERLUMINESCENT DIODES (SLDs) are similar in geometry to lasers but have no built-in
optical feedback mechanism required by laser diodes for stimulated emission to achieve lasing. Although
the output is not fully coherent, superluminescent diodes (SLDs) emit light that consists of amplified
spontaneous emissions. The spectral width and beam angle of SLDs are narrower than that of
conventional LEDs and wider than that of LDs.
