There is now general agreement that the annual component of polar motion is a forced motion excited predominantly by atmospheric dynamics. There exist two external forces to excite polar motion: atmospheric winds, and pressure loading. The main component is pressure forcing, which is a standing wave of the form:
(3)   p = poΘ−31(θ) cos[(2πνA (t - to)] cos(λ - λo)
with po a pressure amplitude, Θ−31 a Hough function describing the latitude distribution of the atmospheric pressure on the ground, θ the geographic co-latitude, t the time of year, to a time delay, νA = 1.003 the normalized frequency of one solar year, λ the longitude, and λo the longitude of maximum pressure. The Hough function in a first approximation is proportional to sinθ cosθ. Such standing wave represents the seasonally varying spatial difference of the Earth's surface pressure. In northern winter, there is a pressure high over the North Atlantic Ocean and a pressure low over Siberia with temperature differences of the order of 50°, and vice versa in summer, thus an unbalanced mass distribution on the surface of the Earth. The position of the vector m of the annual component describes an ellipse (Figure 2). The calculated ratio between major and minor axis of the ellipse is
(4)   m1/m2 =νC
where νC is the Chandler resonance frequency. The result is in good agreement with the observations. From Figure 2 together with eq.(4), one obtains νC = 0.83, corresponding to a Chandler resonance period of
(5)  τC = 441 sidereal days = 1.20 sidereal years
po = 2.2 hPa, λo = - 170° the latitude of maximum pressure, and to = - 0.07 years = - 25 days.
It is difficult to estimate the effect of the ocean, which may slightly increase the value of maximum ground pressure necessary to generate the annual wobble. This ocean effect has been estimated to be of the order of 5–10%.
