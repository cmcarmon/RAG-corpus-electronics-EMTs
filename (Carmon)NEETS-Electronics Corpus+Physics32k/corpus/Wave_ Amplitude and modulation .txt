The amplitude of a wave may be constant (in which case the wave is a c.w. or continuous wave), or may be modulated so as to vary with time and/or position. The outline of the variation in amplitude is called the envelope of the wave. Mathematically, the modulated wave can be written in the form:




u
(
x
,
t
)
=
A
(
x
,
t
)
sin
⁡
(
k
x
−
ω
t
+
ϕ
)

,


{\displaystyle u(x,t)=A(x,t)\sin(kx-\omega t+\phi )\ ,}

where



A
(
x
,

t
)


{\displaystyle A(x,\ t)}
is the amplitude envelope of the wave,



k


{\displaystyle k}
is the wavenumber and



ϕ


{\displaystyle \phi }
is the phase. If the group velocity




v

g




{\displaystyle v_{g}}
(see below) is wavelength-independent, this equation can be simplified as:




u
(
x
,
t
)
=
A
(
x
−

v

g



t
)
sin
⁡
(
k
x
−
ω
t
+
ϕ
)

,


{\displaystyle u(x,t)=A(x-v_{g}\ t)\sin(kx-\omega t+\phi )\ ,}

showing that the envelope moves with the group velocity and retains its shape. Otherwise, in cases where the group velocity varies with wavelength, the pulse shape changes in a manner often described using an envelope equation.
