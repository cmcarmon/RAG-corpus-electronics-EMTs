where the plus sign signiﬁes a motor and the minus sign a generator. Vf is the voltage applied
to the ﬁeld circuit, If is the ﬁeld current, and Rf is the ﬁeld-winding resistance. Vt is the terminal
voltage, Ea is the generated emf, Ia is the armature current, and Ra is the armature resistance. The
generated emf Ea is given by Equation (12.2.16) as
