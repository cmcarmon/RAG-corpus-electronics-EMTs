Note that Z is always less than one, and the larger Z,
the more efﬁcient that estimator is. In fact, when Z ¼ 1,
the estimator achieves the CRLB and is said to be an
efﬁcient estimator in the Fisherian sense.
7. If an unbiased estimator has a variance that achieves
the CRLB for all u 2 Q, it is called a uniformly min-
imum variance unbiased estimator (UMVUE). It can
be shown easily that UMVUE is a consistent estimator
and MLE is usually the UMVUE.
