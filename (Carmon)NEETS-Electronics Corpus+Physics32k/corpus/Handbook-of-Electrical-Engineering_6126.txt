Recently, the harmonic levels of both currents and voltages have increased considerably due to the increasing
use  of  non-linear  loads  such  as  arc  furnaces,  HVdc  converters,  FACTS  equipment,  dc  motor  drives,  and  ac
motor speed control. Moreover, commercial sector loads now contain often unacceptable levels of harmonics
due to widespread use of equipment with rectiﬁer-fed power supplies with capacitor output smoothing (e.g.,
computer power supplies and ﬂuorescent lighting). The need to conserve energy has resulted in energy efﬁcient
designs that exacerbate the generation of harmonics. Although each source only contributes a very small level
of harmonics, due to their small power ratings, widespread use of small non-linear devices may create harmonic
problems which are more difﬁcult to remedy than one large harmonic source.
