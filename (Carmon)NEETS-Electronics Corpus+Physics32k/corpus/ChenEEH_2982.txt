Design of an LNA typically consists of trade-off between
noise ﬁgure and gain while designing at the required stability.
This can often be a difﬁcult task. One technique to make a
potentially unstable transistor an unconditionally stable tran-
sistor is to use resistive loading or feedback at the expense of
reduced power gain and degraded noise ﬁgure.
