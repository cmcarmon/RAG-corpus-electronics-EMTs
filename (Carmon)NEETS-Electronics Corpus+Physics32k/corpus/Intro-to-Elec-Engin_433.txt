Some op amps, such as the 741, have internal RC networks which are intentionally designed to
reduce gain at high frequency. The result (shown in Figure 5.2.4) is that the open-loop gain begins
to fall at a few hertz and then has a characteristic falling at 20 dB/decade or 6 dB/octave (i.e.,
gain ‚àù 1/f ) until eventually the gain becomes unity (0 dB) at about 1 MHz.
