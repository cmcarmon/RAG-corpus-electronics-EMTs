The pushbutton or toggle switch is a simple form of data entry into a digital system. However,
−1 s and digital electronics
a problem occurs since the normal human reaction time is about 10
−8 s. Thus any unnoticed mechanical contact bounce of
responds to times of the order of 10
a few milliseconds will be seen as several distinct switch closures by a digital system. We
may de-bounce the mechanical switch by using an RC circuit and Schmitt trigger logic or
a ﬂip-ﬂop latch. The latter design requires a break-before-make action, which means that
during the throw there is a time when the common is connected to neither terminal.
