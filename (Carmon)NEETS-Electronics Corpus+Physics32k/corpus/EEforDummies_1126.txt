Homing in on the range
Many digital multimeters (and most analog multimeters) require that you 
select the range before the meter can make an accurate measurement. For 
example, if youâ€™re measuring the voltage of a 9 V battery, you set the range 
to the setting closest to (but still above) 9 volts. For most meters, this means 
you select the 20 V or 50 V range.
