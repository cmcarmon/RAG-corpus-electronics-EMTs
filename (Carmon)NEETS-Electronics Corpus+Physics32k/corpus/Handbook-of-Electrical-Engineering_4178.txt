Transmission Line Equations
The transmission line equations for a nonuniform electromagnetic ﬁeld impinging on a system of horizontal
wires have been derived in the time domain by Agrawal et al. [1980], who adapted the theory to the case of
wires above an imperfectly conducting ground. The main advantage of a time domain model over an equivalent
frequency  domain  model  is  its  applicability  to  cases  of  time  varying  and  nonlinear  loads  and  its  ability  to
account for multiple reﬂections on a line with two or more discontinuities. On the other hand, with a frequency
domain model it is intrinsically easier to handle frequency-dependent parameters such as the ground impedance.
The derivation of the time domain coupling equations is conceptually simple: Maxwell’s equations are ﬁrst
integrated over closed cylindrical surfaces and along closed rectangular paths. The resulting integral equations,
which are in terms of electric and magnetic ﬁelds, are then recast in terms of voltages and currents. One version
of the transmission line equations, due to Agrawal et al. [1980], follows:
