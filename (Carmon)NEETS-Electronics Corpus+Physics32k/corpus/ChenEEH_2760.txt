Examples of Calculations of Pulse Propagation
in a One-Dimensional Grid
Figure 9.7(A) graphs examples of the calculated propagation of
a 40-cell-wide rectangular pulse in free space for two cases of
the Courant factor: S ¼ 1 (i.e., Dt is equal to the value for
dispersionless propagation in a one-dimensional grid) and
S ¼ 0:99. To permit a direct comparison of these results,
both ‘‘snapshots’’ are taken at the same absolute time after
the onset of time-stepping. There are three key observations:
1. When S ¼ 1, the rectangular shape and spatial width of
the pulse are completely preserved. For this case, the
abrupt step discontinuities of the propagating pulse are
modeled perfectly. In fact, this is expected since ~vvp  c
for all numerical modes in the grid.
2. When S ¼ 0:99, there is appreciable ‘‘ringing’’ located
behind the leading and trailing edges of the pulse. This
is due to short-wavelength numerical modes in the grid
generated at the step discontinuities of the wave. These
numerical modes are poorly sampled in space and,
