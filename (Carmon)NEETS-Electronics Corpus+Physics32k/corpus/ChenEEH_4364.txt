It is noted that the exact values of the terms in the ﬁrst column
need not be known; instead, only the signs are needed. The
necessary and sufﬁcient conditions that all roots of equations
2.1 lie in the left half of the s plane are that all the coefﬁcients
of equation 2.1 be positive and all terms in the ﬁrst column of
the array have positive sign.
