Let us use our familiar lightbulb as an example and derive the conditions
under which we can treat pieces of matter as lumped elements for inclusion
in electronic circuits. Suppose for the sake of discussion the lightbulb is made
out of a cylindrical piece of filament of length l and cross-sectional area a as
depicted in Figure A.2.
