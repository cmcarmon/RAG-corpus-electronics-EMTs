Using the virtual work principle, the mechanical force in any
direction is the partial derivative of the magnetic energy with
respect to an incremental motion in that direction with the
current held constant. To Ô¨Ånd torque, differentiate with respect
to the rotational angle. Now look at the expression for torque
in this two circuit system:
