AND GATEÂ—(1) An electronic gate whose output is energized only when every input is in its prescribed 
state. An AND gate performs the function of the logical "AND"; also called an AND circuit. (2) A 
binary circuit, with two or more inputs and a single output, in which the output is a logic 1 only when 
all inputs are a logic 1 and the output is a logic 0 when any one of the inputs is a logic 0 [13].
