When a force is applied on a spring, and the length of the spring changes by a differential amount dx, the work done is

{\displaystyle \partial w_{s}=Fdx}

For linear elastic springs, the displacement x is proportional to the force applied




F
=
K

{\displaystyle F=Kx}
,
where K is the spring constant and has the unit of N/m. The displacement x is measured from the undisturbed position of the spring (that is, X=0 when F=0). Substituting the two equations

{\displaystyle W_{s}={\frac {1}{2}}k\left(x_{1}^{2}-x_{2}^{2}\right)}

where x1 and x2 are the initial and the final displacement of the spring respectively, measured from the undisturbed position of the spring.
