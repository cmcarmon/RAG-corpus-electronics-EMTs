Localization cues are features that help localize sound. Cues for sound localization include binaural and monoaural cues.
Monoaural cues can be obtained via spectral analysis and are generally used in vertical localization.
Binaural cues are generated by the difference in hearing between the left and right ears. These differences include the interaural time difference (ITD) and the interaural intensity difference (IID). Binaural cues are used mostly for horizontal localization.
