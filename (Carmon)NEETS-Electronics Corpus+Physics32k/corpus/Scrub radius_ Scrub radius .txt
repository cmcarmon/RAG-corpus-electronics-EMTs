The scrub radius is the distance at the road surface between the tire center line and the SAI line extended downward through the steering axis.
The line through the steering axis creates a pivot point around which the tire turns. If these lines intersect at the road surface, a zero scrub radius would be present. When the intersection is below the surface of the road, this is positive scrub radius. Conversely, when the lines intersect above the road, negative scrub radius is present. The point where the steering axis line contacts the road is the fulcrum pivot point on which the tire is turned. Scrub radius is changed whenever there is a change in wheel offset. For example, when the wheels are pushed out from the body of the car the scrub radius becomes more positive. Older cars tended to have very close to zero scrub radius but often on the positive side, while newer cars with ABS tend to have a negative scrub radius (this is why most newer cars have wheels offset more inboard).
