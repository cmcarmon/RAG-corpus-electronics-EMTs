As stated earlier, orbiting electrons contain energy and are confined to definite energy levels. The
various shells in an atom represent these levels. Therefore, to move an electron from a lower shell to a
higher shell a certain amount of energy is required. This energy can be in the form of electric fields, heat,
light, and even bombardment by other particles. Failure to provide enough energy to the electron, even if
the energy supplied is just short of the required amount, will cause it to remain at its present energy level.
Supplying more energy than is needed will only cause the electron to move to the next higher shell and
the remaining energy will be wasted. In simple terms, energy is required in definite units to move
electrons from one shell to the next higher shell. These units are called QUANTA (for example 1, 2, or 3
quanta).
