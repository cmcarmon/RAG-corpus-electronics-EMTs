The  electrodynamics  of  the  excitable  membrane  of
unmyelinated nerves were ﬁrst described in detail in the
Nobel  prize  work  of  Hodgkin  and  Huxley  [1952].  This
work was later extended to the myelinated nerve mem-
brane  by  Frankenhaeuser  and  Huxley  [1964].

the membrane potential has been depolarized by roughly 15 mV. After excitation, the ionic channel conduc-
tances vary again, causing the membrane to revert back to its resting potential.
