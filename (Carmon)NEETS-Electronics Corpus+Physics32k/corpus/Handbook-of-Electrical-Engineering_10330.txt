VSAT
The VSAT consists of an antenna, outdoor unit (ODU), interfacility link (IFL), and indoor unit (IDU). The
IFL  connects  the  IDU  and  ODU  subsystems,  providing  the  transmit  and  receive  lines,  monitor  and  control
signals, and dc power for the ODU electronics. A single-cable IFL, in which all signals are multiplexed on the
same cable, is usually used to reduce the cost of IFL. VSATs nominally use a 1.2- or 1.8-m offset feed parabolic
antenna. Smaller antenna sizes are preferable to reduce the installation cost. Options for small antennas include
the  use  of  either  a  submeter  parabolic  reﬂector  or  a  ﬂat-plate  antenna.  The  choice  of  antenna  is  a  tradeoff
among performance, installation cost, and aesthetic considerations.
