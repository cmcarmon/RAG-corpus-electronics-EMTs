Linear vertical distance represents voltage on the screen of a cathode-ray tube. Vertical distance units 
can be used in place of voltage in equations. Thus, if only the percent of modulation is required, the 
oscilloscope need not be calibrated and the actual circuit voltages are not required. In figure 1-42, emax 
represents 600 volts (3 large divisions); emin is 200 volts (1 division); and eo is 400 volts (2 divisions). 
Using the equation and the dimensions of the screen pattern, you can figure the percent of modulation as 
follows:
