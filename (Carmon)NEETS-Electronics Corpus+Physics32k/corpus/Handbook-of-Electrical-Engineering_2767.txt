which improve the performance of the speciÔ¨Åc function being designed, can provide interconnections through
wiring areas between logic cells to create compact functions, can use the full variety of CMOS circuit designs
(e.g., dynamic logic, pass-transistor logic, etc.), can use cells previously developed privately for earlier ICs, and
can use cells from a standard library provided by the foundry.
