From  Kirchhoffâ€™s  Current  Law,  the  algebraic  sum 
of  the  current  at  a  junction  in  a  circuit  is  zero. 
Adopting  the  convention  that  current  flowing 
towards  the  junction  is  positive  and  that  flowing 
away  from 
is  negative  we  can 
construct a formula along the following lines:
