Biomass-fueled  power  plants  are  best  suited  in  small  (<100  MW)  sizes  for  DG  to  serve  base  load  and
intermediate loads in the eastern United States and in many other parts of the world. This contribution is clean,
 emissions. Since biomass fuels are sulphur-free, these plants can be used to offset
renewable, and reduces CO
2
 emissions from new fossil power plants. Ash from biomass plants can be recycled and used as
CO
2
fertilizer. A carefully planned and well-managed SRWC (short-rotation woody crop) plantation program with
yields  in  the  range  of  6  to  12  dry  tons/acre/year  can  be  effectively  used  to  mitigate  greenhouse  gases  and
contribute thousands of MW of DG to the U.S. grid by the turn of the century.
