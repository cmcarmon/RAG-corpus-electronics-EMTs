Beginning in the early 1990s, theorists began linking complexity theory to organizational change. Complexity Theory rejects the idea of organizations as a machine, as well as a planned approach to organizational change. Rather, it agrees with the emergent approach that power and constant change are crucial elements of organizational life. It can also be used to explain the often paradoxical nature of organizations.
