LoS is a reliable variable of stability that provides important information about voluntary motor control in the dynamic state. LoS helps assess balance in the dynamic state by instantaneously tracking the change in COM velocity and COM position. The LoS measures postural instability while screening for individuals who are at a higher risk of falling. Individuals with decreased LoS have an increased risk of falling when they shift their bodyweight forward, backward or from side to side and hence are more prone to injuries.
A restricted LoS significantly influences the ability to react to perturbations in balance control testing. This reduction in LoS may be because of weakness of the ankle and foot muscles, musculoskeletal problems of the lower limb, and/or an internal perception of the subject to resist larger displacements. These impairments may help physicians to correlate with the medical examination findings and serve as an important outcome measure for rehabilitation of these specific underlying body impairments. From a clinical perspective, an individual who performs complex mobility tasks can function without support, and is better able to tolerate environmental challenges.
