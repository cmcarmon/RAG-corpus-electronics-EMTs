EXAMPLE 16.1.5
A 440-V, 60-Hz, six-pole, wye-connected, wound-rotor induction motor with a full-load speed of
= 0.5 , Xl1 =
1170 r/min has the following per-phase parameters referred to the stator: R1 = R
= 2 , Xm = 40 , and a stator-to-rotor turns ratio of 2.5.
(cid:7)
The scheme of Figure 16.1.21 is employed for speed control with Rd = 0.02  and R = 1 .

For a speed of 1000 r/min at 1.5 times the rated torque, ﬁnd the duty ratio δ, neglecting friction
and windage, and using the equivalent circuit with jXm moved adjacent to the stator terminals.
