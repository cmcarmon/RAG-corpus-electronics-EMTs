It is impossible for the rotor of an induction motor to turn at the same speed as the rotating magnetic
field. If the speeds were the same, there would be no relative motion between the stator and rotor fields;
without relative motion there would be no induced voltage in the rotor. In order for relative motion to
exist between the two, the rotor must rotate at a speed slower than that of the rotating magnetic field. The.
difference between the speed of the rotating stator field and the rotor speed is called slip. The smaller the
slip, the closer the rotor speed approaches the stator field speed.
