The Ô¨Årst portion of this section discusses concepts, principles of operation, and limitations. The latter portion
describes various applications. In general, CW radars have several potential advantages over pulse radars. Advan-
tages include simplicity and the facts that the transmitter leakage is used as the local oscillator, transmitter spectral
spread is minimal (not true for wide-deviation FM/CW), and peak power is the same as (or only a little greater
than) the average power. This latter situation means that the radar is less detectable by intercepting equipment.
The largest disadvantage for CW radars is the need to provide antenna isolation (reduce spillover) so that
the  transmitted  signal  does  not  interfere  with  the  receiver.  In  a  pulse  radar,  the  transmitter  is  off  before  the
receiver is enabled (by means of a duplexer and/or receiver-protector switch). Isolation is frequently obtained
in the CW case by employing two antennas, one for transmit and one for reception. When this is done, there
is  also  a  reduction  of  close-in  clutter  return  from  rain  or  terrain. A  second  disadvantage  is  the  existence  of
noise sidebands on the transmitter signal which reduce sensitivity because the Doppler frequencies are relatively
close to the carrier. This is considered in more detail below.
