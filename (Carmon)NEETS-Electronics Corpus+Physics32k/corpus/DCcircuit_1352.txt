To store more energy in an inductor, the current through it must be increased. This means
that its magnetic ﬁeld must increase in strength, and that change in ﬁeld strength produces the
corresponding voltage according to the principle of electromagnetic self-induction. Conversely,
to release energy from an inductor, the current through it must be decreased. This means
that the inductor’s magnetic ﬁeld must decrease in strength, and that change in ﬁeld strength
self-induces a voltage drop of just the opposite polarity.
