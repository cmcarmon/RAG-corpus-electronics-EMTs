State vector: A vector that speciÔ¨Åes the state of a dynamical system. For example, the position and velocity
of  a  leaf  falling  to  the  ground  could  be  the  state  vector  for  the  leaf.  For  deterministic  systems,  this
corresponds to the initial conditions for a system of ordinary differential equations. For a special type
of  random  process,  called  a  Markov  process,  the  future  state  is  statistically  independent  of  the  past,
conditioned on knowledge of the state at the present time.
