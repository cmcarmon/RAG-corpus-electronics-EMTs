The electronic implementation of these algorithms employs a digital ﬁlter that breaks the audio spectrum
into many subbands, and various coefﬁcient elements are built into the program to decide when it is permissible
to  remove  one  or  more  of  the  signal  components.  The  details  of  how  the  bands  are  divided  and  how  the
coefﬁcients are determined are usually proprietary to the individual system developers. Standardization groups
have spent many worker-hours of evaluation attempting to determine the most accurate coding system.
