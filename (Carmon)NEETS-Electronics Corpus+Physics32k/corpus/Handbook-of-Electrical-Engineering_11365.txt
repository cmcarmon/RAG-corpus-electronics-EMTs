One important radionuclide commonly used in PET is oxygen 15 with a half-life of 2.07 minutes, which can
be bonded to water for measurement of cerebral blood ﬂow or to O2/CO2 to assess cerebral oxygen utilization.
Another is carbon 11 with a half-life of 20.4 minutes, which can be bonded to glucose to trace glucose utilization.
F-18  ﬂuorodeoxyglucose  (FDG)  has  been  used  to  demonstrate  the  degree  of  malignancy  of  primary  brain
tumors, to distinguish necrosis from tumor, and to predict outcome [Coleman, 1991]. Perhaps the most unusual
feature of this modality is the ability to quantitate the regional metabolism of the human heart [Schelbert, 1990].
