The chromatic dispersion of multimode graded-index and single mode fiber is obtained by measuring
fiber group delays in the time domain. These measurements are made using multiwavelength sources or
multiple sources of different wavelengths. A multiwavelength source could be a wavelength-selectable
laser.
