After the selection of an appropriate thermal control strategy, attention can be turned to meeting the desired
system-level reliability and the target failure rates of each component and subassembly. Individual solid-state
electronic  devices  are  inherently  reliable  and  can  typically  be  expected  to  operate,  at  room  temperature,  for
 h).  However,  since  the  number  of
some  100,000  years,  i.e.,  with  a  base  failure  rate  of  1  FIT  (failures  in  10

devices in a typical logic component is rapidly approaching 1 million and since an electronic system may consist
of  many  tens  to  several  hundreds  of  such  components,  achieving  a  system  Mean  Time  Between  Failures  of
several thousand hours in military equipment and 40,000â€“60,000 hours in commercial electronics is a most
formidable task.
