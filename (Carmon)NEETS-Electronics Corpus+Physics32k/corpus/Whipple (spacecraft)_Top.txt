Whipple mission was a proposal for a space observatory in the NASA Discovery Program 2014 announcement of opportunity. The observatory would try to search for objects in the Kuiper belt and the theorized Oort cloud by doing a blind occultation observation. Although the Oort cloud was hypothized in the 1950s, it has to the date of this proposal not actually been directly detected. The mission overcomes the hurdle of looking by looking for brief moments where the objects would block the light of background stars, rather than would light that exceeds the abilities of current telescopes.
The Kuiper belt was also once only predicted, but since 1992 over 10,000 objects have been found in that region of space. One source of confusion though is that objects like Sedna are not predicted in a model using existing solar system bodies. (see also Planet Nine)
