Figure 4-21, view (A), illustrates the circuit of a negative-diode clamper. Compare this with the 
positive-diode clamper in view (A) of figure 4-18. Note that the diode is reversed with reference to 
ground. Like the positive clamper, resistor R1 provides a discharge path for C1; the resistance must be a 
large value for C1 to have a long discharge time. The low resistance of the diode provides a fast charge 
path for C1. Once C1 becomes charged, it acts as a source of voltage which will help determine the 
maximum and minimum voltage levels of the output wave shape. The input wave shape shown in view 
(B) is a square wave which varies between +25 and âˆ’25 volts. The output wave shapes are shown in the 
bottom half of view (B). You will find that the operation of the negative clamper is similar to that of the 
positive clamper, except for the reversal of polarities.
