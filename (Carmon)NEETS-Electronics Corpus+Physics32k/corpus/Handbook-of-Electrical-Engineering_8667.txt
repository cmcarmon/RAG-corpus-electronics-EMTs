variables can be assigned to registers. The question is how the 68000 compiler chose which variables to assign
to registers and which to leave in memory. As might be expected, the compiler assigned registers based on their
usage for the unoptimized option as well as the optimized. The exact counting strategy is unknown. However,
a fair estimate, which yields the same assignment as the compiler, is to count only the variable’s usage in the
loop—the likely place for the program to spend most of its execution time. There are other ways to estimate
the variable usage such as assigning weights to a reference based on its placement within a loop, its placement
within a conditional (if-then-else) statement, etc. These estimates and how they are applied within a compiler
can change the variable allocation as well as the efﬁciency of the code.
