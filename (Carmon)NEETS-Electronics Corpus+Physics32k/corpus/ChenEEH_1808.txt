Intserv introduces three service classes to support RTI, RTT,
and elastic multimedia applications. They are Guaranteed
service, Controlled Load service, and the Best-Effort service.
A ﬂow descriptor is used to describe the trafﬁc and QoS
requirements of a ﬂow (Leon-Garcia and Widjaja, 2000). The
ﬂow descriptor consists of two parts: a ﬁlter speciﬁcation
(ﬁlterspec) and a ﬂow speciﬁcation (ﬂowspec). The ﬁlterspec
provides the information required by the packet classiﬁer to
identify the packets that belong to that ﬂow. The ﬂowspec
consists of a trafﬁc speciﬁcation (Tspec) and service request
speciﬁcation (Rspec). Tspec speciﬁes the trafﬁc behavior of the
ﬂow in terms of token bucket parameters (b,r), while the Rspec
speciﬁes the requested QoS requirements in terms of band-
width, delay, jitter, and packet loss.
