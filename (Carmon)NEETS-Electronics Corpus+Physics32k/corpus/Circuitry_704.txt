Readers should note that the most rapid method 
of  fault  diagnosis 
that  of 
following  voltages  or  signals  from  one  end  to  the 
other.  Most  textbooks  on  fault  finding  discuss  the 
relative  methods  of  the  so-called  end-to-end  and 
half  split  methods.  The  former  method  involves 
tracing the signal and measuring voltages from the 
input to the output (or vice versa) whilst the latter 
method  involves  dividing  the  circuit  into  two 
halves  and 
is 
operational before making a further sub-division of 
the half in which the fault resides.
