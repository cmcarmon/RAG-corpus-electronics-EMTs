Speech is a uniquely human means of interpersonal communication. Problems that affect speech can occur at
the  initial  transducer  (the  larynx)  or  at  other  areas  of  the  vocal  tract.  They  can  be  of  neurological  (due  to
cortical, brainstem, or peripheral nerve damage), structural, and/or cognitive origin. A person might only be
able to make a halting attempt at talking, or might not have sufÔ¨Åcient control of other motor skills to type or
write.
