The phase margin is the amount of additional phase lag at the
gain crossover frequency required to bring the system to the
verge of instability. The crossover frequency is the frequency at
which jG(jv)j, the magnitude of the open-loop transfer func-
tion, is unity. The phase margin g is 1808 plus the phase angle
f of the open-loop transfer function at the gain crossover
frequency, or:
