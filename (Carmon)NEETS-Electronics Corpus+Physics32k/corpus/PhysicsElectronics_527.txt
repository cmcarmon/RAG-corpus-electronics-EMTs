Because of its high-frequency response and small input impedance, this circuit is often
used to receive high-frequency signals transmitted via a coaxial cable. For this purpose
the input impedance of the ampliﬁer is adjusted to match the distributed impedance of the
coaxial cable – usually 50 to 75 Ω.
