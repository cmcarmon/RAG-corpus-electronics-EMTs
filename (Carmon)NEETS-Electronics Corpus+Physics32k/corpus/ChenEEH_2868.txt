The amplitude of radar signals has a very wide dynamic
range. To avoid the saturation of the ampliÔ¨Åer output, the
log receiver is usually used. In a log receiver, the amplitude
of the output is proportional to the logarithm of the ampli-
tude of the input. It can compress the output dynamic range so
that weak signals can be enhanced and observed.
