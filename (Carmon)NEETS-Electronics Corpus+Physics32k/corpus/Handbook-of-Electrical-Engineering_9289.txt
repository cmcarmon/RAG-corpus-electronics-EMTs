Summary and Conclusions
Software has been prone to such a wide variety of error conditions that much of the cost and time associated
with  developing  software  projects  is  devoted  to  defect  removal.  In  spite  of  the  high  expense  levels  and  long
schedules historically associated with defect removal, deployed software is often unstable and requires contin-
uous maintenance.
