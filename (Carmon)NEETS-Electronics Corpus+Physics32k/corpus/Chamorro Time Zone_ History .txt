The Mariana Islands were not part of any time zone legislated by the U.S. Congress until the Chamorro time zone was established by Public Law 106-564 on December 23, 2000. Prior to 2000, Guam's standard time was based on territorial Public Law 5-25 (1959) which designated the time Guam Standard Time. The law (Guam Code Annotated, Title 1, Section 1010) was established long before the Northern Mariana Islands came under U.S. sovereignty in 1986, and still remains in the book today despite federal overlap.
