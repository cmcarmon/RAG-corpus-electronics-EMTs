We shall use the minimum recommended value for 
R1 (i.e. 10 kG) and ensure that the value of R2 that 
we calculate from the formula is at least ten times 
larger in order to satisfy the criteria that R2 should 
be  very  much  larger  than  R1. When  selecting  the 
value  for  C we  need  to  choose  a  value  that  will 
keep the value of R2 relatively large. A value of 100 
nF should be about right and should also be easy to 
locate.  Making  R2 the  subject  of  the  formula  and 
substituting for C = 100 nF gives:
