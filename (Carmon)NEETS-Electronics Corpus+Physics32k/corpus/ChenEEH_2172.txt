. Ferrimagnetic materials possess characteristics between
those of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials.
There is an incomplete antiparallel alignment of magnetic
moments as in the antiferromagnetic materials, and, con-
sequently, there is a net magnetization M, though typi-
cally less than ferromagnetic materials. Ferrites are a
special class of ferrimagnetic material that have a low
conductivity at high frequencies. These ceramic-like ma-
terials are extremely useful in high-frequency applications
due to their small conduction losses. Examples include
