By the artful definition of Equation 1.24, we have managed to obtain an
expression for power resembling that due to a DC signal. In other words, the
rms value of a periodic signal is the value of a DC signal that would have resulted
in the same average power dissipation.18 In like manner, the rms value of a DC
signal is simply the constant value of the signal itself.
