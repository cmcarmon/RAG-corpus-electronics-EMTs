The natural evolution of the automated bell and PAC controls led itself to the use of vacuum driven provers with arrays of sonic nozzles (utilizing choked flow to provide precise flow rates. Such a use eliminated the need for a bell, as the flow rate is provided through the nozzles. When sufficient vacuum is applied to a sonic nozzle it creates a constant flow rate. Bernoulli's principle is applied to calculate the chosen flow rates chosen by the user or automated by a computer. Computers and PAC systems automate the process, and most sonic nozzle provers are capable of displaying not only meter proofs to a user, but are also capable of transmitting proofs as well as other important data to database systems across a computer network.
