Here, hFE is called the dc common-emitter current gain, and because IC >> IB, then hFE is large, typically 50 to
300. The implication of this may be seen immediately: if the small current IB can be used to control the large
current  IC ,  then  the  transistor  may  obviously  be  used  as  a  current  ampliﬁer.  [This  is  why  Fig.  24.25(b)  is
inadequate—it completely neglects this all-important current-gain property of the transistor.] Furthermore, if
a load resistance is connected into the collector circuit, it will become a voltage ampliﬁer, too.
