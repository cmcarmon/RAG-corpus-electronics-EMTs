Even though ideal sources could theoretically produce inﬁnite energy, one should recognize
that inﬁnite values are physically impossible. Various circuit laws and device representations or
models are approximations of physical reality, and signiﬁcant limitations of the idealized concepts
or models need to be recognized. Simpliﬁed representations or models for physical devices are
the most powerful tools in electrical engineering. As for ideal sources, the concept of constant V
or constant I for dc sources and the general idea of v or i being a speciﬁed function of time should
be understood.
