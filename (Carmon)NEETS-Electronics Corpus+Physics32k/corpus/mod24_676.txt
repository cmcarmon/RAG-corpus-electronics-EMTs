Most LD transmitters contain output power control circuitry to compensate for temperature
sensitivity. This circuitry maintains the LD output at a constant average value by adjusting the bias
current of the laser. In most cases LED transmitters do not contain output power control circuitry. LD and
LED transmitters may also contain cooling devices to maintain the source at a relatively constant
temperature. Most LD transmitters either have an internal thermo electric cooler or require a relatively
controlled external temperature. Because LDs require more complex circuitry than LEDs, fiber optic
transmitters using LDs are more expensive. For more information concerning fiber optic transmitters and
their drive circuitry, refer to the reference material listed in appendix 2.
