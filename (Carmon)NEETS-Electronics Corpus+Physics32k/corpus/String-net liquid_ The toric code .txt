The toric code is a two dimensional spin lattice, that acts as a quantum error-correcting code. It is defined on a two dimensional lattice with toric boundary conditions with a spin-1/2 on each link. It can be shown that the ground state of the standard toric code Hamiltonian is an equal weight superposition of closed string states. Such a ground state is an example of a string-net condensate which has the same topological order as the Z2 spin liquid above.
