organization’s intranet or an ISP can form its own DS domain.
One important implication of this is that to provide any
service guarantees the entire path between the source and
destination must be under some DS domain (possibly mul-
tiple). Even if a single hop is not under some DS domain, then
service cannot be guaranteed. DiffServ architecture can be
extended across multiple domains using a service level agree-
ment (SLA) between them. An SLA speciﬁes rules for trafﬁc
remarking, actions to be taken for out-of-proﬁle trafﬁc, and
other such speciﬁcations.
