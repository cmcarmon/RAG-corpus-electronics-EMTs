Cosmic inflation and the accelerated expansion of the universe can be characterized by the equation of state of dark energy. In the simplest case, the equation of state of the cosmological constant is



w
=
−
1


{\displaystyle w=-1}
. In this case, the above expression for the scale factor is not valid and



a
∝

e

H
t




{\displaystyle a\propto e^{Ht}}
, where the constant H is the Hubble parameter. More generally, the expansion of the universe is accelerating for any equation of state



w
<
−
1

/

3


{\displaystyle w<-1/3}
. The accelerated expansion of the Universe was indeed observed. According to observations, the value of equation of state of cosmological constant is near -1.
Hypothetical phantom energy would have an equation of state



w
<
−
1


{\displaystyle w<-1}
, and would cause a Big Rip. Using the existing data, it is still impossible to distinguish between phantom



w
<
−
1


{\displaystyle w<-1}
and non-phantom



w
≥
−
1


{\displaystyle w\geq -1}
.
