. The high-density ﬂoppy disk drive was ﬁrst introduced
in 1995. High-density ﬂoppy disks, while sharing a 3.5-in
size with the standard ﬂoppy disks, are much faster and
have up to one hundred times more capacity than the
standard ﬂoppy disks. One example is the Zip drive,
produced by Iomega. Each Zip disk is capable of storing
up to 100 MB of data. Similarly, Imation, a subsidiary of
3 M, also manufactures the Super disk (also known as the
LS 120) that can store up to 120 MB of data.
