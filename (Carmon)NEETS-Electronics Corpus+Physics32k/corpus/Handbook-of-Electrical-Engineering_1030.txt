work with the continuous electrical signals collected by sensors, we often convert the continuous signal to a
digital signal (a sequence of values) with a piece of hardware called an analog-to-digital (A/D) converter. Once
we have collected the digital signal, we are ready to use the computer to apply digital signal processing (DSP)
techniques to it. These DSP techniques can be designed to perform a number of operations such as:
