Expressed in mathematical language, using the calculus of variations, the evolution of a physical system (i.e., how the system actually progresses from one state to another) corresponds to a stationary point (usually, a minimum) of the action.
Several different definitions of "the action" are in common use in physics. The action is usually an integral over time. However, when the action pertains to fields, it may be integrated over spatial variables as well. In some cases, the action is integrated along the path followed by the physical system.
The action is typically represented as an integral over time, taken along the path of the system between the initial time and the final time of the development of the system:

{\displaystyle {\mathcal {S}}=\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}L\,dt,}

where the integrand L is called the Lagrangian. For the action integral to be well-defined, the trajectory has to be bounded in time and space.
Action has the dimensions of [energy]⋅[time], and its SI unit is joule-second, which is identical to the unit of angular momentum.
