The underground feeders have signiÔ¨Åcant capacitance in addition to the reactance and resistance. The capac-

and phase-to-phase and phase-to-ground distances [Fink and Beaty, 1978]. The residential underground system
generally uses single-conductor cables with polyethylene insulation. The older systems use rubber insulation
with neoprene jacket. Circuit parameters should be obtained from manufacturers. The distribution feeders are
short transmission lines. Even the primary feeders are only a few miles long. This permits the calculation of
/mi values by the length of the section. The length of
the section resistance and reactance by multiplying the 
the section in a single-phase two-wire system is two times the actual length. In a balanced three-phase system,
it is the simple length. In a single-phase three-wire system the voltage drop on the neutral conductor must be
calculated. Further information may be obtained from Pansini [1991].
