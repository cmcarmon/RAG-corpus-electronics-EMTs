The ratio detector is not affected by amplitude variations on the fm wave. The output of the detector
adjusts itself automatically to the average amplitude of the input signal. C5 charges to the sum of the
voltages across R1 and R2 and, because of its time constant, tends to filter out any noise impulses. Before
C5 can charge or discharge to the higher or lower potential, the noise disappears. The difference in charge
across C5 is so slight that it is not discernible in the output. Ratio detectors can operate with as little as
100 millivolts of input. This is much lower than that required for limiter saturation and less gain is
required from preceding stages.
