7.3.13 If the circuit of Example 7.3.1 is to switch from
cutoff to saturation, ﬁnd the condition on vS, given
that the transistor has β = 100.
7.3.14 Consider the circuit of Example 7.3.3. For RE = 0
and β = 50, ﬁnd iE.
7.3.15 If the BJT in the circuit of Example 7.3.1 has
β = 150, ﬁnd iC and vCE when: (a) iB = 20 µA,
and (b) iB = 60 µA. Specify the state of the BJT
in each case.
7.3.16 The circuit shown in Figure P7.3.16 has a pnp BJT
turned upside down. Find RB when vEC = 4 V and
β = 25.
7.3.17 Reconsider the circuit of Figure P7.3.16. With
β = 25, ﬁnd the condition on RB such that iC has
the largest possible value.
