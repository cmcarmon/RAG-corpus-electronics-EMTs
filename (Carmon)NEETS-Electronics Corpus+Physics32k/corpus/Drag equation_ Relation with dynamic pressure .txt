The drag force can also be specified as,

{\displaystyle F_{D}\propto P_{d}A}

where, PD is pressure exerted by fluid on area A. Here the pressure PD is referred to as dynamic pressure due to kinetic energy of fluid experiencing relative flow velocity u. This is defined in similar form as kinetic energy equation:
