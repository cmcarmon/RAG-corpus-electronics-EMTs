With massively parallel computers containing thousands of
processors, new challenges arise. Operating systems for these
machines must support extremely fast synchronization and
communication among thousands of processes. Each proces-
sor may have its own devices attached, and, hence, the operat-
ing system must control thousands of I/O channels at once.
The concepts of virtual memory and time-sharing must be
extended to accommodate massive parallelism. Perhaps the
most important challenge is that the programming environ-
ment should permit parallel programs to be written with only
modest effort beyond what is required for sequential ones
(Denning and Tichy, 1990).
