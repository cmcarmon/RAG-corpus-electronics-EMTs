Basic Concepts and Terminology
To describe this process analytically and at the same time introduce some terminology that is common in spread
spectrum  parlance,  we  proceed  as  follows.  Consider  a  communicator  that  desires  to  send  a  message  using  a
transmitted  power S Watts  (W)  at  an  information  rate Rb  bits/s  (bps).  By  introducing  a  SS  modulation,  the
bandwidth  of  the  transmitted  signal  is  increased  from  Rb  Hz  to Wss  Hz  where Wss  @  Rb  denotes  the  spread
spectrum bandwidth. Assume that the channel introduces, in addition to the usual thermal noise (assumed
to  have  a  single-sided  power  spectral  density  (PSD)  equal  to  N0 W/Hz),  an  additive  interference  (jamming)
having power J distributed over some bandwidth WJ. After despreading, the desired signal bandwidth is once
again  now  equal  to  Rb  Hz  and  the  interference  PSD  is  now NJ  =  J/Wss.  Note  that  since  the  thermal  noise  is
assumed to be white, i.e., it is uniformly distributed over all frequencies, its PSD is unchanged by the despreading
operation and, thus, remains equal to N0. Regardless of the signal and interferer waveforms, the equivalent bit
energy-to-total noise ratio is, in terms of the given parameters,
