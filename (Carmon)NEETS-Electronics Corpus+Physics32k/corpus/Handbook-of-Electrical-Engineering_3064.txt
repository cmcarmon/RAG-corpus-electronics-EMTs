Each of the circuits described here is commonly used in the realization of active ﬁlters. When implemented
as shown and used in the appropriate gain and bandwidth speciﬁcations of the ampliﬁers, they will provide
excellent  performance.  Computer-aided  ﬁlter  design  programs  are  available  which  simplify  the  process  of
obtaining proper element values and simulation of the resulting circuits [Krobe et al., 1989; Wilamowski et al., 1992].
