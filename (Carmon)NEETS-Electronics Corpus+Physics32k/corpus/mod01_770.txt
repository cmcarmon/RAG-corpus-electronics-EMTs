RESISTANCEâ€”(1) The property of a conductor which determines the amount of current that will flow
as the result of the application of a given electromotive force. All conductors possess some
resistance, but when a device is made especially for the purpose of limiting current flow, it is called a
resistor. A resistance of 1 ohm will allow a current of 1 ampere to flow through it when a potential of
1 volt is applied. (2) The opposition which a device or material offers to the flow of current. The
effect of resistance is to raise the temperature of the material or device carrying the current. (3) A
circuit element designed to offer a predetermined resistance to current flow.
