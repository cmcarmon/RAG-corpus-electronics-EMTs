1. All  unused  CMOS  inputs  should  be  tied  either  to  VDD  or  VSS,  whichever  is  appropriate  for  proper
operation of the gate. This rule applies even to inputs of unused gates, not only to protect the inputs
from possible static charge buildup, but to avoid unnecessary supply current drain. Floating gate inputs
will cause all the FETs to be conducting, wasting power and heating the chip unnecessarily.
