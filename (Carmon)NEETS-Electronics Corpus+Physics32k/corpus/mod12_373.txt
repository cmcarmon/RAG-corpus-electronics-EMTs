Figure 2-49 shows the relationship between decimal numbers, binary numbers, and a pulse-code
waveform that represents the numbers. The table is for a 16-level code; that is, 16 standard values of a
quantized wave could be represented by these pulse groups. Only the presence or absence of the pulses
are important. The next step up would be a 32-level code, with each decimal number represented by a
series of five binary digits, rather than the four digits of figure 2-49. Six-digit groups would provide a
64-level code, seven digits a 128-level code, and so forth. Figure 2-50 shows the application of
pulse-coded groups to the standard values of a quantized wave.
