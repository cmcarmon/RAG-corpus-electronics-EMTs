A simple FPGA model is shown in Figure 3.3. In this ﬁgure,
processing elements, typically containing conﬁgurable logic
and storage blocks, are represented by squares. The processing
elements are connected to conﬁgurable switches, represented
as circles, that control data ﬂow by establishing the desired
connectivity between the busses. Much of the area in an FPGA
is usually taken up by the conﬁgurable switches and the busses;
local and global busses can also be organized hierarchically.
The ﬁgure demonstrates the regularity found in most FPGAs;
practical FPGAs often contain additional resources, such as
