The turbine drives a conventional generator. The typical rating is in the 20- to 100-MW range. The exhaust
steam is condensed in a direct-contact condenser. A part of the obtained water is reinjected into the ground.
The rest of the water is fed into a cooling tower to provide cold water to the condenser.
