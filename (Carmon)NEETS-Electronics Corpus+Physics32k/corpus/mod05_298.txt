To analyze the rotating magnetic field in a two-phase stator, refer to figure 4-3. The arrow represents
the rotor. For each point set up on the voltage chart, consider that current flows in a direction that will
cause the magnetic polarity indicated at each pole piece. Note that from one point to the next, the
polarities are rotating from one pole to the next in a clockwise manner. One complete cycle of input
voltage produces a 360-degree rotation of the pole polarities. Let's see how this result is obtained.
