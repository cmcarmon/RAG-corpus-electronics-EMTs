Voice, video, and data communications
Electronic circuits in your cellphone work together to convert the sound of 
your voice into an electrical pattern, manipulate the pattern (to compress 
and encode it for efficient, secure transmission), transform it into a radio 
signal, and send it out through the air to a communication tower. Other elec-
tronic circuits in your handset detect incoming messages from the tower, 
decode the messages, and convert an electrical pattern in the message into 
sound (through a speaker) or a text or video message (through your phoneâ€™s 
display).
