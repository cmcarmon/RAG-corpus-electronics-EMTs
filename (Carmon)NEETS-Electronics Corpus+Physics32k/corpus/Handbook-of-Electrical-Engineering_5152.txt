Pyrosensitive Properties
The 
  is  governed  by  a  class  of  materials  known  as  solid  electrolytes.  On  thermally
energizing  such  materials,  they  exhibit  superionic  electric  conduction  (also  known  as  fast  ion  conduction),
with  the  result  that  the  medium,  which  is  dielectric  under  cold  conditions,  becomes  conducting  at  elevated
temperatures. Correspondingly, the media that are embedded with solid electrolytes show different extents of
electromagnetic reï¬‚ection/transmission characteristics at low and high temperatures and hence can be manip-
 
ulated thermally [Neelakanta et al.,
