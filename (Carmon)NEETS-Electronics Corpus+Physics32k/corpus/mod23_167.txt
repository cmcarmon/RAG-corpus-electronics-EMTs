Through use, magnetic heads pick up dirt, dust, lint, and oxide particles from the magnetic tape. 
These particles collect on the magnetic head and, if left unchecked, could cause signal dropout errors that 
degrade the quality of recording and playback. To keep magnetic heads clean, regularly clean them with a 
cotton-tipped applicator soaked in either isopropyl alcohol or in a magnetic head cleaner recommended by 
the recorder's manufacturer. A good rule of thumb is to clean the heads each time you change a tape reel 
or cartridge.
