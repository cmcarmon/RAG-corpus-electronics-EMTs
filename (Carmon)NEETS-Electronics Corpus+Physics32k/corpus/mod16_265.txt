The CATHODE-RAY OSCILLOSCOPE (CRO or O-SCOPE) is commonly used for the analysis of
waveforms generated by electronic equipment. Several types of cathode-ray oscilloscopes are available
for making waveform analysis. The oscilloscope required for a particular test is determined by
characteristics such as input-frequency response, input impedance, sensitivity, sweep rate, and the
methods of sweep control. The SYNCHROSCOPE is an adaptation of the cathode-ray oscilloscope. It
features a wide-band amplifier, triggered sweep, and retrace blanking circuits. These circuits are desirable
for the analysis of pulse waveforms.
