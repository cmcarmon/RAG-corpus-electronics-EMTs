A conventional method of evaluating high-frequency transmission systems and components has been 
through the use of standing wave ratio (swr) measurements to obtain an overall indication of transmission 
line performance. This method involves feeding a sine-wave signal into the system and measuring the 
maximum and minimum amplitudes of the standing waves that result from system discontinuities or load 
mismatches. The ratio between the minimum and maximum swr values is then taken as the system 
FIGURE OF MERIT. The swr measurement, however, does not isolate individual discontinuities or 
mismatches when multiple reflections are present; it only indicates their total effect. Time-domain 
reflectometry measurements, on the other hand, isolate the line characteristics in time (location). As a 
result, multiple reflections resulting from more than one discontinuity or impedance variation that are 
separated in distance on the line are also separated in time at the monitoring point and can be individually 
analyzed.
