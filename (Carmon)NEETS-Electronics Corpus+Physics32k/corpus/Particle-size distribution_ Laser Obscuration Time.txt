A focused laser beam rotates in a constant frequency and interacts with particles within the sample medium. Each randomly scanned particle obscures the laser beam to its dedicated photo diode, which measures the time of obscuration.
The time of obscuration directly relates to the particle's Diameter, by a simple calculation principle of multiplying the known beam rotation Velocity in the directly measured Time of obscuration, (D=V*t).
