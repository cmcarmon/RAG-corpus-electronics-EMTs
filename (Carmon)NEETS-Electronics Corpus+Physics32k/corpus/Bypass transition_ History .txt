P. S. Klebanoff is the first scientist who experimentally observed bypass transition scenario during his experiments in elevated free-stream turbulence flow. He identified an important aspect of the bypass transition. In his experiment, using hot wires he studied flow over a flat plate which was subjected to a 0.3% free-stream turbulence level. At this moderate free-stream turbulence level, he could observe a low-frequency velocity perturbation signal, that is less than 12 Hz which is much smaller than usual Tollmien-Schlichting wave frequency. He also observed thickening and thinning of boundary layer which is not in the case of low free-stream turbulence flow.
