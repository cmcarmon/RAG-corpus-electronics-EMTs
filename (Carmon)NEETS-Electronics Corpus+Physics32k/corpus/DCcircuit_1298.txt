Modern theories of magnetism maintain that a magnetic ﬁeld is produced by an electric
charge in motion, and thus it is theorized that the magnetic ﬁeld of a so-called ”permanent”
magnets such as lodestone is the result of electrons within the atoms of iron spinning uni-
formly in the same direction. Whether or not the electrons in a material’s atoms are subject
to this kind of uniform spinning is dictated by the atomic structure of the material (not unlike
how electrical conductivity is dictated by the electron binding in a material’s atoms). Thus,
only certain types of substances react with magnetic ﬁelds, and even fewer have the ability to
permanently sustain a magnetic ﬁeld.
