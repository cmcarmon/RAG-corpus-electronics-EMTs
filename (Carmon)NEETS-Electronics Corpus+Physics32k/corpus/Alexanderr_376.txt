â–  METHOD 2 We  can  simulate  the  circuit  in  Fig.  7.67  directly,
since  PSpice can  handle  the  open  and  closed  switches  and  determine
the initial conditions automatically. Using this approach, the schematic
is  drawn  as  shown  in  Fig.  7.70.  After  drawing  the  circuit,  we  select
Analysis/Setup/Transient and  set  Print  Step to  0.1  s  and  Final  Step
We save the circuit, then select Analysis/Simulate to sim-
to 
ulate the circuit. In the PSpice A/D window, we select Trace/Add and
display
