The  gate-body  voltage  required  to  create  a  conductive  channel,  known  as  the 
threshold voltage, Vth, depends on the thickness of the oxide layer and on the doping level 
in the body. For N-channel MOSFET’s, Vth typically ranges from 2 V to 10 V and for P-
channel MOSFET’s, Vth ranges from -2 V to -10 V. During operation, once a channel is
