Efforts to model speech production have focused principally
on the ‘‘source–ﬁlter’’ view of the physiologic system in which,
over short stationary intervals of an utterance, speech is mod-
eled as a linear, time-invariant, acoustic ﬁltering operation on
an appropriate excitation (the ‘‘source’’). The process of pro-
ducing the source input is assumed to be decoupled from the
dynamics of the acoustic ﬁlter. The prominent discrete-time
(DT) source-ﬁlter model of speech, known variously as the
‘‘all-pole’’ or
is essentially a
DT version of classic analog acoustic models. The linear-
prediction model underlies a majority of the modern speech
products and services.
