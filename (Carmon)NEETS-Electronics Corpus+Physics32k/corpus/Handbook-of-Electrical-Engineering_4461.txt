An MMIC is formed by fabricating all active and passive
circuit  elements  or  components  and  interconnections  onto  or  into  the  surface  of  a  semi-insulating
semiconducting substrate by deposition and etching schemes such as epitaxy, ion implantation, sputter-
ing, evaporation, and/or diffusion, and utilizing photolithographic processes for pattern deÔ¨Ånition, thus
eliminating the need for internal wire bond interconnects.
