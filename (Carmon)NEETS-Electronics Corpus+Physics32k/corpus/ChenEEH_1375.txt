Multiprocessor architectures have been categorized by the
existence of single or multiple instruction and data streams.
This chapter has examined multiple-instruction, multiple-
data, and MIMD architectures in some detail. The most
common form of MIMD multiprocessor arrangement is one
of symmetric multiprocessors (SMP). The use of multiproces-
sors creates the problem of maintaining cache coherence over
several levels of cache existing at different places in the com-
puter architecture. This chapter has also presented several
cache coherence approaches and the common MESI protocol.
In addition, the discussion has surveyed approaches to soft-
ware design for multiprocessors and some of the more recent
problems in multiprocessor design.
