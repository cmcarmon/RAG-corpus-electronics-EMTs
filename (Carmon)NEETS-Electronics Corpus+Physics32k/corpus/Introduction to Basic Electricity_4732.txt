The 68HC11 is a powerful 8-bit, 16-bit address 
microcontroller developed by Motorola, now pro-
duced by Freescale Semiconductor. It has an in-
struction set that is similar to the older 68xx (6801, 
6805, and 6809) family. Depending on the applica-
tion, the 68HC11 comes with a variety of features 
including built-in windowed EPROM/ EEPROM/
OTPROM (one-time programmable), static RAM, 
digital I/O, timers, A/D converter, PWM generator, 
and synchronous and asynchronous communication 
channels. Freescale Semiconductor offers a low-cost 
evaluation board to explore the capabilities of the 
68HC11.
