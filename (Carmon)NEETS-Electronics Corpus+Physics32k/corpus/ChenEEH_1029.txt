Instruction-Level Optimization
Techniques involving instruction-level optimization target
programmable cores such as general-purpose microprocessors,
DSP, and microcontrollers. In these techniques, power opti-
mization is achieved by selecting a minimum power instruc-
tion mix for executing application software. Tiwari et al.
(1994) describe a power dissipation reduction of up to 40%
that could be achieved by rewriting code. In another work by
Woo et al. (2001), an instruction encoding technique is used
for low-power instruction fetches. The basic approach is that
instruction ﬁelds of a binary program are re-encoded so that
the number of bits switched from the neighboring ﬁelds of
consecutive instructions is minimized; this technique allowed
up to a 62% reduction in switching activities. Similar tech-
niques can be found in Stammerman et al. (2001) and Choi
and Chatterjee (2001). Another approach that can reduce the
