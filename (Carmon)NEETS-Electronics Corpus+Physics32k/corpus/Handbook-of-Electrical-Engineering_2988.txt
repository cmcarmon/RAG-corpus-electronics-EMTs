Hybrid-Pi Equivalent Circuit of a Monolithic BJT
The conventional hyprid-pi model in Fig. 28.11 generally fails to provide sufﬁciently accurate predictions of
the high frequency response of monolithic diffused or implanted BJTs. One reason for this modeling inaccuracy
is that the hybrid-pi equivalent circuit does not reﬂect the fact that monolithic transistors are often fabricated
on lightly doped, noninsulating substrates that establish a distributed, large area, pn junction with the collector
region. Since the substrate-collector pn junction is back biased in linear applications of a BJT, negligible static
and low frequency signal currents ﬂow from the collector to the substrate. At high frequencies, however, the
depletion  capacitance  associated  with  the  reverse  biased  substrate-collector  junction  can  cause  signiﬁcant
susceptive  loading  of  the  collector  port.  In  Fig.  28.13,  the  lumped  capacitance,  Cbb,  whose  mathematical
deﬁnition is similar to that of Cm in Eq. (28.5), provides a ﬁrst-order account of this collector loading. Observe
that this substrate capacitance appears in series with a substrate resistance, Rbb, which reﬂects the light doping
nature  of  the  substrate  material.  For  monolithic  transistors  fabricated  on  insulating  or  semi-insulating  sub-
strates, Rbb is a very large resistance, thereby rendering Cb b unimportant with respect to the problem of predicting
steady-state transistor responses at high signal frequencies.
