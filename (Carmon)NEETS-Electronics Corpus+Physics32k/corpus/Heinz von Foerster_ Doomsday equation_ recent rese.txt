The hyperbolic growth of the world population observed until the 1970s has recently been correlated to a non-linear second order positive feedback between demographic growth and technological development that can be spelled out as follows:
technological growth implies an increase in carrying capacity, an increase in the number of people who can survive on any given plot of land
demographic growth (more people) implies more potential inventors and hence an acceleration of technological growth
accelerating technological growth causes accelerating growth of carrying capacity, in a positive feedback loop
faster population growth likewise feeds back by accelerating growth of the number of potential inventors, and then even faster technological growth
hence, even faster growth of the Earth's carrying capacity for people, and so on
