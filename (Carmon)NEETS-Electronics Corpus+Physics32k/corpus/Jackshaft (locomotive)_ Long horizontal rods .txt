The simplest arrangement is to use long coupling rods, running horizontally. A large vertical movement at the wheel end gives rise to only a small horizontal movement at the jackshaft drive. For a diesel-mechanical locomotive this can be compensated for by horizontally compliant mounting of the transmission. The heavy engine is carried over the drive wheels for adhesion weight, but the relatively lightweight gearbox can be mounted at one end, beyond the coupled wheelbase. A final drive casing is also narrow enough to mount between the frames, allowing it to be mounted low down and level with the driving axles.

This arrangement is common for slow speed diesel shunters, but not usually for main line speeds. The Swedish D-lok of 1925 did use it, with two motors geared to a single jackshaft with short rods between two driving axles of a 1-C-1 layout.
