Before checking the resistance of a circuit or of a part, make certain that the power has been turned
off. Also make sure capacitors in the associated circuit are fully discharged. To check continuity, always
use the lowest ohmmeter range. If the highest range is used, the meter may indicate zero, even though
appreciable resistance is present in the circuit. Conversely, to check a high resistance, use the highest
scale since the lower range scale may indicate infinity, even though the resistance is less than a megohm.
In making resistance tests, you must remember that even though the external ohmmeter leads are
