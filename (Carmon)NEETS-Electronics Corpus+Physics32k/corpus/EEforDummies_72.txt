Tapping into electrical energy
As electrons travel through a conductor, they transport energy from one 
end of the conductor to the other. Because like charges repel, each electron 
exerts a noncontact repulsive force on the electron next to it, pushing that 
electron along through the conductor. As a result, electrical energy is propa-
gated through the conductor.
