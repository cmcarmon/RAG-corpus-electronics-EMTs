OPTICAL TIME-DOMAIN REFLECTOMETER (OTDR)â€”A piece of test equipment used
to test a fiber-optic cable for such things as attenuation, localized losses, and defects. It
transmits an optical pulse (usually a laser) into the fiber-optic cable and analyzes the
resulting reflections in terms of amplitude versus distance.
