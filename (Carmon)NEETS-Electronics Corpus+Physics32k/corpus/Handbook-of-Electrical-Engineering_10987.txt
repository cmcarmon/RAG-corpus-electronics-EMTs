The  transmembrane  charge  is  the  result  of  a  metabolic  process  that  creates  ionic  gradients  with  a  high
concentration of potassium ions (K+) inside and a high concentration of sodium ions (Na+) outside. There are
concentration gradients for other ions, the cell wall being a semipermeable membrane that obeys the Nernst
equation  (60  mV/decade  concentration  gradient  for  univalent  ions).  The  result  of  the  ionic  gradient  is  the
transmembrane potential that, in the cells referred to earlier, is about 90 mV, the interior being negative with
respect to the exterior. Figure 113.9 illustrates this concept for a cylindrical cell.
