TEM modes:  Transverse-electromagnetic modes, often called transmission line modes. These modes can
exist only when a second conductor exists within the waveguide, such as a center conductor
on a coaxial cable. Because these modes cannot exist in single, closed conductor structures,
they are not waveguide modes.
