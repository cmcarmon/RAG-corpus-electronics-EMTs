As Dr. Jacques von HÃ¤msterviel is in a jail cell on a desert asteroid (his cell being secretly decked out with various lab equipment that he can hide from prison guards by voice command), his experiment bounty hunter, Gantu, must send any experiments he captures to him via "molecular teleportation." As seen in the series and the movie that started it, molecular teleportation consists of a large glass container lowering down over the object for transport. When the teleporter is charged, a swirling, yellow flash of light and smoke surrounds the object before it disappears in a flash. Another such flash of light and smoke appears in the destination teleporter where the object reappears. The glass enclosure on these teleporters are an absolute necessity as opening them will automatically cancel a teleport.
