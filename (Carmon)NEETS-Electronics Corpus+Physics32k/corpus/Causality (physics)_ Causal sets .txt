In causal set theory causality takes an even more prominent place. The basis for this approach to quantum gravity is in a theorem by David Malament. This theorem states that the causal structure of a spacetime suffices to reconstruct its conformal class. So knowing the conformal factor and the causal structure is enough to know the spacetime. Based on this Rafael Sorkin proposed the idea of Causal Set Theory. Causal Set Theory is a fundamentally discrete approach to quantum gravity. The causal structure of the spacetime is represented as a Poset, while the conformal factor can be reconstructed by identifying each poset element with a unit volume.
