Powerful transmitters with highly directional antennas are used at earth stations. Even with these 
large transmitters, a lot of signal loss occurs at the satellite. The satellite antenna receives only a small 
amount of the transmitted signal power. A relatively weak signal is received at the satellite receiver. This 
presents little problem as the strength of the signal received on the up link is not as critical as that 
received on the down link. The down-link signal is critical because the signal transmitted from the 
satellite is very low in power. Development of high-gain antennas and highly sensitive receivers have 
helped to solve the down-link problem.
