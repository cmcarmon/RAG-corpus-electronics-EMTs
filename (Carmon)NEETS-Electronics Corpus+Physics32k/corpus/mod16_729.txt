This selects one of two logarithms used to control attenuator and IF gain. MIN
NOISE (button illuminated) reduces the noise level by reducing attenuation and IF
gain 10 dB. MIN DISTORTION (button not illuminated) reduces distortion to its
minimum. To observe any changes, the RF attenuation displayed on the CRT
readout must be 10 dB higher than that set by the MIN RF ATTEN selector.
