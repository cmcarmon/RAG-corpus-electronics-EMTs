In the step response, when the trajectory meets the switching line x1 + x2 = –1 for the second time, trajectory
motions at both sides of the line are directed towards it, resulting in a sliding motion down the switching line.
Completing the phase portrait by drawing responses from other initial conditions shows that the autonomous
system is stable and also that all responses will ﬁnally slide down a switching line to equilibrium at x1 = –1.
An advantage of the phase plane method is that it can be used for systems with more than one nonlinearity
and for those situations where parameters change as functions of the phase variables. For example, Fig. 100.54
shows the block diagram of an approximate model of a servomechanism with nonlinear effects due to torque
saturation and Coulomb friction.
