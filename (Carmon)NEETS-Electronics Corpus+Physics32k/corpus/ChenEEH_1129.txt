Honeywell and Raytheon developed uncooled, microma-
chined thermal imagers. Figure 6.9 includes both a micrograph
of part of the Honeywell array and a schematic showing its
construction. In the recent past, micromachined arrays of
uncooled infrared detectors were incorporated into some
Cadillac vehicles. The systems permit the driver to see the
thermal images from people or animals in the road far beyond
the range of the headlights.
