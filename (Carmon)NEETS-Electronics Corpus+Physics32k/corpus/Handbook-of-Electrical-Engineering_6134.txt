The connection to ground may consist of a ground mat of buried conductors, electrodes (earth rods), or
both. The shape and dimensions of the electrodes, their locations, and the layout of an ground mat, plus the
resistivity of the ground at different levels must be speciÔ¨Åed in order to evaluate the ground resistance. A grid
of buried conductors and electrodes is usually considered to be all at the same potential. Where grid sections
are joined by buried or aerial links, these links can have resistance allowing the grid sections to have different
potentials. It is usual to consider a buried link as capable of radiating current into the soil.
