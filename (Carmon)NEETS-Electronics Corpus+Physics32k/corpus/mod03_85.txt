If the frequency of the alternating current is increased, the compass needle will swing back and forth
at a higher rate (faster). At a high enough frequency, the compass needle will not swing back and forth,
but simply vibrate around the magnetic north position. This happens because the needle cannot react fast
enough to the very rapid current alternations. The compass (a simple meter) will indicate the average
value of the alternating current (remember the average value of a sine wave is zero) by vibrating around
the zero point on the meter (magnetic north). This is not of much use if you wish to know the value of the
alternating current. Some device, such as a rectifier, is needed to allow the compass to react to the
alternating current in a way that can be useful in measuring the current.
