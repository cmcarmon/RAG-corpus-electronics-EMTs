These examples illustrate the point that systems described (and implemented) by diﬀerence equations serve
as ﬁlters for discrete-time signals. The ﬁlter’s order is given by the number p of denominator coeﬃcients
in the transfer function (if the system is IIR) or by the number q of numerator coeﬃcients if the ﬁlter is
FIR. When a system’s transfer function has both terms, the system is usually IIR, and its order equals p
regardless of q. By selecting the coeﬃcients and ﬁlter type, ﬁlters having virtually any frequency response
desired can be designed. This design ﬂexibility can’t be found in analog systems. In the next section, we
detail how analog signals can be ﬁltered by computers, oﬀering a much greater range of ﬁltering possibilities
than is possible with circuits.
5.14 Filtering in the Frequency Domain28
Because we are interested in actual computations rather than analytic calculations, we must consider the
details of the discrete Fourier transform. To compute the length-N DFT, we assume that the signal has a
duration less than or equal to N. Because frequency responses have an explicit frequency-domain speciﬁcation
(5.47) in terms of ﬁlter coeﬃcients, we don’t have a direct handle on which signal has a Fourier transform
equaling a given frequency response. Finding this signal is quite easy. First of all, note that the discrete-
time Fourier transform of a unit sample equals one for all frequencies. Because the input and output of
