â€¢ A major disadvantage of voltage signaling is the possibility that the voltage at the indi-
cator (voltmeter) will be less than the voltage at the signal source, due to line resistance
and indicator current draw. This drop in voltage along the conductor length constitutes a
measurement error from transmitter to indicator.
