Frequently,  however,  even  more  dramatic  reductions  in  the  total  resistance  can  be  achieved  simply  by
increasing the cross-sectional area for heat ﬂow, within the chip module (e.g., chip, substrate, heat spreader)
as well as along the wetted exterior surface. The implementation of such a scale-up generally results in a larger
module footprint and/or lower volumetric packaging density, both of which are highly undesirable, and yet is
rewarded with a lower thermal resistance. In evaluating packaging approaches, it must, therefore, be understood
that the thermal resistance is a somewhat ﬂawed ﬁgure-of-merit and that a better reﬂection of the efﬁcacy of
a  thermal  management  technique  can  be  obtained  by  normalizing RT  with  respect  to  the  packaging  density,
using the number of chips on a substrate or number of chips/packages on a printed circuit board.
