To help compare distances at different orders of magnitude this section lists lengths starting at 1011 metres (100 Gm or 100 million kilometres or 0.7 astronomical units).
109 Gm – 0.7 AU – Distance between Venus and the Sun
149.6 Gm (93.0 million mi) – 1.0 AU – Distance between the Earth and the Sun - the definition of the astronomical unit
180 Gm – 1.2 AU – Maximum diameter of Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole in the center of Milky Way galaxy
228 Gm – 1.5 AU – Distance between Mars and the Sun
570 Gm – 3.8 AU – Length of the tail of Comet Hyakutake measured by Ulysses; the actual value could be much higher
591 Gm – 4.0 AU – Minimum distance between the Earth and Jupiter
780 Gm – 5.2 AU – Distance between Jupiter and the Sun
965 Gm – 6.4 AU – Maximum distance between the Earth and Jupiter
