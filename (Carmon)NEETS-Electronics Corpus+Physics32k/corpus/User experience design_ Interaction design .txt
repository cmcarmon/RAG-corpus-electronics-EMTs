There are many key factors to understanding interaction design and how it can enable a pleasurable end user experience. It is well recognized  that building great user experience requires interaction design to play a pivotal role in helping define what works best for the users. High demand for improved user experiences and strong focus on the end-users have made interaction designers critical in conceptualizing design that matches user expectations and standards of the latest UI patterns and components. While working, interaction designers take several things in consideration. A few of them are:
Defining interaction patterns best suited in the context
Incorporating user needs collected during user research into the designs
Features and information that are important to the user
Interface behavior like drag-drop, selections, and mouse-over actions
Effectively communicating strengths of the system
Making the interface intuitive by building affordances
Maintaining consistency throughout the system.
In the last few years, the role of interaction designer has shifted from being just focused on specifying UI components and communicating them to the engineers to a situation now where designers have more freedom to design contextual interfaces which are based on helping meet the user needs. Therefore, User Experience Design evolved into a multidisciplinary design branch that involves multiple technical aspects from motion graphics design and animation to programming.
