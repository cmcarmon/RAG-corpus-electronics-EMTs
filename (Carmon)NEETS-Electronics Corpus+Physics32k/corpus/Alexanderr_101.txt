in  Fig.  2.60(a),  the  voltmeter  consists  of  a  d’Arsonval  movement  in
series  with  a  resistor  whose  resistance 
is  deliberately  made  very
large  (theoretically,  inﬁnite),  to  minimize  the  current  drawn  from  the
circuit.  To  extend  the  range  of  voltage  that  the  meter  can  measure,
series  multiplier  resistors  are  often  connected  with  the  voltmeters,  as
shown in Fig. 2.60(b). The multiple-range voltmeter in Fig. 2.60(b) can
measure voltage from 0 to 1 V, 0 to 10 V, or 0 to 100 V, depending on
whether the switch is connected to
