Figure  7.40  shows  a  practical  common-emitter 
amplifier  with  bias  stabilization.  This  stage 
provides a gain of 150 to well over 200 (depending 
upon  the  current  gain,  hie, of  the  individual 
transistor  used).  The  circuit  will  operate  with 
supply voltages of between 6 V and 18 V.
