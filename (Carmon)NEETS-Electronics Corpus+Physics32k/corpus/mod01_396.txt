A hydrometer, shown in figure 2-12, is a glass syringe with a float inside it. The float is a hollow 
glass tube sealed at both ends and weighted at the bottom end, with a scale calibrated in specific gravity 
marked on its side. To test an electrolyte, draw it into the hydrometer using the suction bulb. Draw 
enough electrolyte into the hydrometer to make the float rise. Do not draw in so much electrolyte that the 
float rises into the suction bulb. The float will rise to a point determined by the specific gravity of the 
electrolyte. If the electrolyte contains a large amount of active ingredient, its specific gravity will be 
relatively high. The float will rise higher than it would if the electrolyte contained only a small amount of 
active ingredient.
