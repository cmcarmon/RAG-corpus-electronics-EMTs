CDMA
A San Diego Ô¨Åeld test held in 1991 showed that a cellular CDMA scheme can provide higher capacity than cellular
TDMA (time division multiple access). A cellular CDMA system [Lee, May 1991] does not require a frequency
reuse scheme. All the CDMA cells share the same radio channel. Therefore, the capacity of a cellular CDMA system
is higher than either cellular
