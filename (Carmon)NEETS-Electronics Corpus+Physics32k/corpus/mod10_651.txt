Nearly all antennas have been developed from two basic types, the Hertz and the Marconi. The basic 
Hertz antenna is 1/2 wavelength long at the operating frequency and is insulated from ground. It is often 
called a DIPOLE or a DOUBLET. The basic Marconi antenna is 1/4 wavelength long and is either 
grounded at one end or connected to a network of wires called a COUNTERPOISE. The ground or 
counterpoise provides the equivalent of an additional 1/4 wavelength, which is required for the antenna to 
resonate.
