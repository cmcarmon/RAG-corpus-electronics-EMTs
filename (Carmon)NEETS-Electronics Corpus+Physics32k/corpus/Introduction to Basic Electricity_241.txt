Always	avoid	cold	solder	joints
Always	separate	power	controls	and	other	connections
Always	separate	analog	and	digital	components
Create	traces	should	hard-to-find	components	be	included
Remember	to	always	make	integral	nodes	accessible
Solder	the	components	systematically;	solder	small	components	first,	then,
solder	larger	components	next
Strategize	the	spaces	you	allow	between	components
Take	note	of	any	heat	spots
