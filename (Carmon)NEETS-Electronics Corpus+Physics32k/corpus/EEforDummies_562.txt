Just to make things interesting (not to mention confusing), some diodes use 
the same color‐coding scheme on their packaging as resistors, but instead 
of translating the code into a value (such as resistance), the color code 
simply gives you the semiconductor identification number for the diode. For 
instance, the color sequence “brown‐orange‐red” indicates the numerical  
sequence “1‐3‐2” so the diode is a 1N132 germanium diode. (Refer to the 
resistor color code chart in Chapter 5.)
