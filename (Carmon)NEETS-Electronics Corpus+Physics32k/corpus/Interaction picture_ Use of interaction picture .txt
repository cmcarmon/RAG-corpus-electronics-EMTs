The purpose of the interaction picture is to shunt all the time dependence due to H0 onto the operators, thus allowing them to evolve freely, and leaving only H1,I to control the time-evolution of the state vectors.
The interaction picture is convenient when considering the effect of a small interaction term, H1,S, being added to the Hamiltonian of a solved system, H0,S. By utilizing the interaction picture, one can use time-dependent perturbation theory to find the effect of H1,I, e.g., in the derivation of Fermi's golden rule, or the Dyson series in quantum field theory: in 1947, Tomonaga and Schwinger appreciated that covariant perturbation theory could be formulated elegantly in the interaction picture, since field operators can evolve in time as free fields, even in the presence of interactions, now treated perturbatively in such a Dyson series.
