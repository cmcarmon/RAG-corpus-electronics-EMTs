Since before its release, the True20 system has been open to users under the terms of the Open Gaming License. To use the True20 logo though required a separate license and license fee purchased from Green Ronin. Several companies have taken advantage of this to produce their own True20 titles.
On April 12, 2008, Chris Pramas of Green Ronin Publishing announced a new, free licensing agreement with third-party publishers to produce True20 products. Details were posted on the companyâ€™s website and forums, and met with praise from publishers, freelancers and players alike.
