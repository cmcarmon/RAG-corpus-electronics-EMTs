where n is the actual speed of the machine in revolutions per minute, S is the per-unit slip, fs
is the supply frequency in hertz, P is the number of poles, and n1 is the synchronous speed in
revolutions per minute. Equation (13.2.18) suggests that the speed of the induction motor can
be varied by varying either the slip or the synchronous speed, which in turn can be varied by
changing either the number of poles or the supply frequency. Any method of speed control that
depends on the variation of slip is inherently inefﬁcient because the efﬁciency of the induction
motor is approximately equal to 1 − S. On the other hand, if the supply frequency is constant,
varying the number of poles results only in discrete and stepped variation in motor speed.
Indeed, all methods of speed control require some degree of sacriﬁce in performance, cost,
and simplicity. These disadvantages must be weighed carefully against the advantages of speed
variability.
