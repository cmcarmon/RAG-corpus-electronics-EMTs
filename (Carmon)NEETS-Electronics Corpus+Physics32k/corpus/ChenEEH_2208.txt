perpendicular to the surface, thus allowing it to be pulled out
of the integral on the left-hand side of equation 2.5. The
bounding surface is known as a Gaussian surface.
For instance, assume ~DD ¼ ^rrf (r). The left-hand side of equa-
tion 2.5 in spherical coordinates becomes 4pD(r0)r 2
0 , where r0
is the radius of the spherical surface of integration enclosing
the charge distribution. This result must equal Q, the total
charge enclosed. In particular, if r0 is arbitrarily small, the ﬁeld
surrounding a point charge is obtained.
