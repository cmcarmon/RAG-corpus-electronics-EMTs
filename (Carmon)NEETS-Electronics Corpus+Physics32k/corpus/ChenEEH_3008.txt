Because the antennaâ€™s length determines the resonant fre-
quency of the patch, higher antenna resonances will coincide
with frequencies that are multiples of the fundamental reso-
nance. If active circuitry, which may generate harmonic fre-
quencies,
is integrated with the patch antenna, harmonic
radiation leading to co-site interference may occur. A circular
geometry patch antenna may be used to reduce this problem.
In this case, higher resonances of the antenna will be deter-
mined by circular harmonics (Bessel
functions) and can
be designed to occur away from circuit harmonics. A plot of
the input impedance of one particular type of circular geom-
etry patch, the circular segment patch antenna, is shown in
