Thus, when a wire or component lead is inserted into a hole on the breadboard, there are
four more holes in that column providing potential connection points to other wires and/or com-
ponent leads. The result is an extremely ï¬‚exible platform for constructing temporary circuits.
For example, the three-resistor circuit just shown could also be built on a breadboard like this:
