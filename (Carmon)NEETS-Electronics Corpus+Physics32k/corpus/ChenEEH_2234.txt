Note that for the three-dimensional case of a grounded PEC
sphere in front of a point charge, the image charge induced on
the sphere is smaller than the source charge, whereas in a two-
dimensional case the image charge is equal in strength to the
source charge. Problems involving combinations of the bound-
aries shown in Figure 2.7 can be solved by ﬁrst obtaining the
image in one of the boundaries and then reﬂecting both source
and image on the other boundary.
