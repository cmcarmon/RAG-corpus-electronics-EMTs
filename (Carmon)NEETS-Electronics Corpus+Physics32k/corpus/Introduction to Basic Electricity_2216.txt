The direction of current flow can be determined by 
applying the left-hand rule for generators. The  arrow 
shows the direction of current flow at position B. When 
the loop is rotated to position D, the action reverses. 
As the dark half moves up through the magnetic lines 
of force and the light half moves down, applying the 
left-hand rule for generators shows that the induced 
voltage changes polarities. The voltage reaches a peak
