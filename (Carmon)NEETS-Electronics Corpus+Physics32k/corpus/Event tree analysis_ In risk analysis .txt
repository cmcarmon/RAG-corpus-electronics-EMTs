Event tree analysis can be used in risk assessment by determining the probability that is used to determine the risk when multiplied by the hazard of the event. Event Tree Analysis is a tool that makes easy to see what pathway is creating the greatest probability of failure for a specific system. It is common to find single point failures that do not have any intervening events between the initiating event and a failure. With Event Tree Analysis single point failure can be targeted to include an intervening step that will reduce the overall probability of failure and thus reducing the risk of the system. The idea of adding an intervening event can happen anywhere in the system for any pathway that generates too great of a risk, the added intermediate event can reduce the probability and thus reduce the risk.
