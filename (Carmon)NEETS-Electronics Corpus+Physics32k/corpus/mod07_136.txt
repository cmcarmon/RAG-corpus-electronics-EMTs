One of the most important uses of a diode is rectification. The normal PN junction diode is
well-suited for this purpose as it conducts very heavily when forward biased (low-resistance direction)
and only slightly when reverse biased (high-resistance direction). If we place this diode in series with a
source of ac power, the diode will be forward and reverse biased every cycle. Since in this situation
current flows more easily in one direction than the other, rectification is accomplished. The simplest
rectifier circuit is a half-wave rectifier (fig. 1-21 view A and view B) which consists of a diode, an ac
power source, and a load resister.
