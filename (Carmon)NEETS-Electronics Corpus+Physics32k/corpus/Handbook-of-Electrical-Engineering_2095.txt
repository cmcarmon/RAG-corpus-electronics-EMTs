Hydrophone Sensors and Output
Hydrophone sensors are underwater microphones capable of operating in water and under hydrostatic pressure.
These sensors receive radiated and reﬂected acoustic energy that arrives through the multiple paths of the ocean
medium from a variety of sources and reﬂectors. As with a microphone, hydrophones convert acoustic pressure
to electrical voltages or to optical signals.
