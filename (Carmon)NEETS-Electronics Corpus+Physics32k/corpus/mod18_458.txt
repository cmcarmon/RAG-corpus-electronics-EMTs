Energy is coupled into the cavity from the radar by means of an rf cable connected to the input loop. 
Energy is coupled out of the cavity to the rectifier and meter by means of the output loop. You can vary 
the amount of coupling between the echo box and the crystal rectifier by changing the position of the 
output loop. A schematic diagram of the output circuit is shown in figure 4-4, view B. The energy picked 
up by the loop is rectified, filtered, and applied to the meter. The method of connecting the echo box in a 
radar system is shown in figure 4-4, view C.
