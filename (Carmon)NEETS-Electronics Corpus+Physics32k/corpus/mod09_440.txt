A sawtooth wave can be generated by using an RC network. Possibly the simplest sawtooth 
generator is that which is shown in figure 3-38, view (A). Assume that at T0 (view (B)), S1 is placed in 
position P. At the instant the switch closes, the applied voltage (Ea) appears at R. C begins to charge to E a 
through R. If S1 remains closed long enough, C will fully charge to Ea. You should remember from 
NEETS, Module 2, Alternating Current and Transformers, that a capacitor takes 5 time constants (5TC) 
to fully charge. As the capacitor charges to the applied voltage, the rate of charge follows an exponential 
curve. If a linear voltage is desired, the full charge time of the capacitor cannot be used because the 
exponential curve becomes nonlinear during the first time constant.
