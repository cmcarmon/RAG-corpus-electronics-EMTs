The meter in Figure 15-8 has five voltage positions, 
four current positions, and three resistance positions. 
There are five scales on the meter to accommodate the 
various ranges and functions. The technician selects the 
switch on the multimeter for the desired voltage, cur-
rent, or resistance range. The zero-ohm control adjusts 
the ohmmeter circuit to compensate for variations in 
the voltage of the internal batteries. The function switch 
has three positions: 2DC, 1DC, and AC. To measure 
current, DC voltage, and resistance, the function switch 
is placed at 2DC or 1DC, according to the polarity 
of the applied current or voltage. The function switch 
 permits reversal of the test lead connections without 
 removing the leads from the circuit being tested.
