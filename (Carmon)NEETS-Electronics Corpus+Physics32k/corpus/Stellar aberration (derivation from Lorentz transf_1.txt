The stellar aberration is purely an effect of the change of the reference frame. The astronomer orbits (with Earth) around the Sun and furthermore rotates around the axis of Earth. His current rest frame S' therefore has different velocities relative to the rest frame S of the barycenter of the Solar System at different times. Hence the astronomer observes that the position of the star changes. The formula is derived under the condition that the change of the position of the star and of Earth is negligible in the period of observation. That is correct for almost all stars: the amplitude of the parallax of a star, for a distance of ≥ n parsec, is ≤ 1/n ".
