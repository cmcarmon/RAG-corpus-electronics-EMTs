It is assumed that φ
s(i) >>  EC – EF. The electrical thickness of the ﬁlm will then be given
by delec = d – ws – wi. Typical values of φ
i are 1 V, so that if ND – NA = 1017 cm–3, then ws + wi ≈ 2000 Å =
0.2 µm in GaN. Thus, if d ≈ 0.5 µm, 40% of the electrons will be lost to surface and interface states, and delec ≈
0.3 µm.
Inhomogeneity
A  sample  that  is  inhomogeneous  in  depth  can  be  analyzed  according  to  Eq. (22.107)  and  Eq. (22.108),  as
mentioned above. However, if a sample is laterally inhomogeneous, it is nearly always impossible to carry out
an  accurate  analysis.  One  indication  of  such  inhomogeneity  is  a  resistivity  ratio  Q  >>  1  (Fig. 22.37)  in  a
symmetric sample, which would be expected to have Q = 1. The reader should be warned to never attempt an
f-correction (Fig. 22.37) in such a case, because the f-correction is valid only for sample-shape asymmetry, not
inhomogeneity.
