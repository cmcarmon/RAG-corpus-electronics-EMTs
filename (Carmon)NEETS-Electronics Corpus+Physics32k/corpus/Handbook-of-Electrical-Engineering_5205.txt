California’s Mojave Desert is the site of Solar Two, the world’s most technically advanced solar power plant.
Solar  Two  uses  an  innovative  molten  salt  technology  to  capture  and  store  the  sun’s  energy.  This  technology
vastly differs from other solar technologies because, for the ﬁrst time, it allows the practical storage of solar
energy during the day to generate electricity at night.
