In physics, interaction-free measurement is a type of measurement in quantum mechanics that detects the position or state of an object without an interaction occurring between it and the measuring device. Examples include the Renninger negative-result experiment, the Elitzurâ€“Vaidman bomb-testing problem, and certain double-cavity optical systems, such as Hardy's paradox.
