The theorem can also be applied to rigid bodies, stating that the kinetic energy T of a rigid body, as viewed by an observer fixed in some inertial reference frame N, can be written as:

where




m



{\displaystyle {m}}

N






H

{\displaystyle {^{N}\!\mathbf {\bar {H}} }}
is the angular momentum of the rigid body about the center of mass, also taken in the inertial frame N; and

R




{\displaystyle ^{N}{\!\!\mathbf {\omega } }^{R}}
is the angular velocity of the rigid body R relative to the inertial frame N.
