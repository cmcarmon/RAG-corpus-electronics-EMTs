Second,
in contrast to all previous examples, the output waveform in this circuit is
a gross distortion of the input waveform. Note in particular that the input voltage
waveform has no average value, (no DC value), whereas the output has a significant DC
component, roughly 0.3 Eo. The DC motors in most toys, for example, will run nicely
if connected across the resistor in the circuit of Figure 4.21a, whereas they will not run
if driven directly by the sinusoid vI(t). This circuit is called a half-wave rectifier, because it
reproduces only half of the input wave. Rectifiers are present in power supplies of most
electronic equipment to generate DC from the 60-Hz ‘‘sinusoidal’’ wave from 110-V
AC power line.
