In order to differentiate between arithmetic and logical operations it is usual to represent OR and AND by
~ and â€˜. Table 81.5 lists some typical RTL examples that include arithmetic, bit-by-bit logic, shift, rotate, scale
and conditional operations. It is assumed that the three registers are set initially to A = 10110, B = 11000 and
C = 00001.
