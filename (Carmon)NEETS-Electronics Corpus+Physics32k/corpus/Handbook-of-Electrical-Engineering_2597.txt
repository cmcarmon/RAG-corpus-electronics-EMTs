the carrier velocity is saturated, however, the dependence of the current on drain bias is suppressed because
the speed of the carriers is ﬁxed at usat, and ID,sat (cid:181) usat/Rch (cid:181) (VG – VTH) usat, a linear gate-voltage dependence.
As  a  result,  the  current  available  from  a  short  device  is  not  as  large  as  would  be  expected  if  we  assumed  it
behaved like a long device.
