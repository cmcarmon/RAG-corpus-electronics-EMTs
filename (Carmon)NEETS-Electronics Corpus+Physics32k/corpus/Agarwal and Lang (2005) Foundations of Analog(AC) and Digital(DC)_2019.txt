which is the same as the characteristic polynomial for second-order systems
(see Equation 12.85 from Chapter 12). Depending on the relative values of
α and ωo, the roots of this second-order polynomial will be real or complex.
Shortly, we will show that the behavior of the system response depends heavily
on the nature of these roots, and that the values of ωo and α provide substantial
insight into the form of the frequency response plot. We will also study the
correspondence between the frequency domain interpretation of α and ωo and
our previous time-domain interpretation of Chapter 12.
