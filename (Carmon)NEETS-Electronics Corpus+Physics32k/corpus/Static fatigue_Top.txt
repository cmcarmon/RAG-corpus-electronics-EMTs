Static fatigue describes the fracture happening at a stress level less than the value required to cause ordinary tensile fracture. It is a manifestation of the possibly adverse effect of environment on materials behavior. This term highlights the contribution of environment to the crack propagation in materials under applied or residual stress, which leads to stress concentration and thus fatigue. It is also called “delayed fracture”, referring to the long period of time the crack takes to grow large enough to cause spontaneous failure. It is a form of material embrittlement, and occurs in various materials and diverse environments.
