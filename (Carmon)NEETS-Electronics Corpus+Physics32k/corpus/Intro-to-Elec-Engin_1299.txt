It can be seen that bn = 0 for n = 1, 2, 3, . . . for even symmetry. Similarly, for odd symmetry,
an = 0 for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . . For half-wave symmetry, an = bn = 0 for n = 2, 4, 6, . . . so that
the series contains only the odd-harmonic components. For relatively smooth signals, the higher
harmonic components tend to be smaller than the lower ones. Discontinuous signals have more
signiÔ¨Åcant high-frequency content than continuous signals.
