Because  of  SAWs’  relatively  high  operating  frequency,  linear  delay,  and  tap  weight  (or  sampling)  control,
they  are  able  to  provide  a  broad  range  of  signal  processing  capabilities.  Some  of  these  include  linear  and
dispersive  ﬁltering,  coding,  frequency  selection,  convolution,  delay  line,  time  impulse  response  shaping,  and
others. There are a very broad range of commercial and military system applications which include components
for  radars,  front-end  and  IF  ﬁlters,  CATV  and VCR  components,  cellular  radio  and  pagers,  synthesizers  and
analyzers, navigation, computer clocks, tags, and many, many others [Campbell, 1989; Matthews, 1977].
