Sketch the asymptotes of the magnitude and phase of the frequency response. Determine
the values of Q, ωo, α, the two ω.707 frequencies, and the bandwidth. Write the
time-domain expression for the steady state value of vc for f = 1 MHz.
We can obtain Vc by multiplying the current I by the impedance of the parallel R, L, C
combination as:
