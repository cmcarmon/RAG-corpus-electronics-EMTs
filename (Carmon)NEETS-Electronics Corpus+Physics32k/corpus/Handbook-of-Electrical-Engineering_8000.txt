systems  [see  Gaonkar,  1984].  Early  processors  contained  a  few  thousands  of  transistors,  while  the  top-end
microprocessor has over 1.5 million. The early processors were 4-bit machines, initially intended for hand-held
calculator use; the largest chips today are intended for use as full central processing units of large computers.

the CMOS version is typically a bit more expensive and requires less power. An excellent overview of micro-
processors and systems using them is found in Rafﬁquzzaman [1990].
