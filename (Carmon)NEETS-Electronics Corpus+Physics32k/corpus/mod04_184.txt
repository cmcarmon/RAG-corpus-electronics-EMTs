To understand fully the alloy or solvent action on molten solder, look at the tin-lead fusion diagram 
shown in figure 2-35. This diagram shows that pure lead (point A) melts at 621ยบ F. Point C shows the 
lowest melting point of the tin and lead alloy. The alloy at point C consists of 63-percent tin (SN63) and 
37-percent lead. This is commonly called 63/37 solder. It has a melting point of 361ยบ F. This type of 
solder, because of its very low melting point, is used in printed circuit boards and microminiature 
electronic repair. As you can see from the chart, the melting point of the alloy is lowered when tin is 
added to lead.
