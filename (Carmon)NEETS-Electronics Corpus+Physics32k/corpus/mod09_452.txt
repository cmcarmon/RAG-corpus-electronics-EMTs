shows that an increase in gate length increases the number of time constants. An increase in the number 
of time constants decreases linearity. The reason is that C2 now charges to a greater percentage of the 
applied voltage, and a portion of the charge curve is being used that is less linear. The waveform in figure 
3-42, view (A), shows an increase in amplitude (physical length), an increase in the time that C2 is 
allowed to charge (electrical length), and a decrease in linearity. If a smaller percentage of VCC is used, 
the gate length is decreased. As shown in view (B), this decreased gate length results in an increase in 
linearity, a decrease in the time that C2 is allowed to charge (electrical length), and a decrease in 
amplitude (physical length).
