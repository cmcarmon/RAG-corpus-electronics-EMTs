The shape of an orbit is determined only by the centripetal forces at each point of the orbit, which are the forces acting perpendicular to the orbit. By contrast, forces along the orbit change only the speed, but not the direction, of the velocity.
Let the instantaneous radius of curvature at a point P on the orbit be denoted as R. For the kth force field that produces that orbit, the force normal to the orbit Fk must provide the centripetal force

{\displaystyle F_{k}={\frac {m}{R}}v_{k}^{2}}

Adding all these forces together yields the equation
