Diodes are two terminal semiconductors of various types that are used in seemingly endless 
applications. The operation of normal PN-junction diodes has already been discussed, but there are a 
number of diodes with special properties with which you should be familiar. A discussion of all of the 
developments in the diode field would be impossible so some of the more commonly used special diodes 
have been selected for explanation. These include Zener diodes, tunnel diodes, varactors, silicon 
controlled rectifiers (SCR), and TRIACs.
