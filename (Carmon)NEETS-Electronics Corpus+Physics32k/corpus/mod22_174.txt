Magnetic tapes have many common features and data recording formats. Each tape is physically 
marked in some manner to indicate where reading and writing on tape is to begin (known as the 
beginning-of-tape [BOT]), and where it ends (known as the end-of-tape [EOT]). The length of tape 
between the BOT and EOT is referred to as the usable recording (reading/writing) surface or usable 
storage area. BOT/EOT markers are usually made of short silver strips of reflective tape (1/4-inch wide 
by 1/2-inch long) as shown in figure 2-14. The BOT marker is normally placed toward the front edge of 
the tape (the side nearest you when the tape is mounted on the tape unit). The EOT marker is placed 
toward the back edge (the side farthest from you when the tape is mounted on the tape unit). They are 
placed approximately 15 to 20 feet in from each end on the shiny side of the tape. Sometimes, holes or 
clear plastic inserts are used as markers in place of reflective strips. Regardless of the method used, the 
BOT/EOT markers are sensed by an arrangement of lamps and/or photodiode sensors to indicate where 
reading and writing is to begin and end.
