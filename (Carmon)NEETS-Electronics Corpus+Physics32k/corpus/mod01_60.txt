When two or more elements are chemically combined, the resulting substance is called a
COMPOUND. A compound is a chemical combination of elements which can be separated by chemical
but not by physical means. Examples of common compounds are water which consists of hydrogen and
oxygen, and table salt, which consists of sodium and chlorine. A MIXTURE, on the other hand, is a
combination of elements and compounds, not chemically combined, that can be separated by physical
means. Examples of mixtures are air, which is made up of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and small
amounts of several rare gases, and sea water, which consists chiefly of salt and water.
