You don’t need to know how to calculate capacitance (and, yes, there is a 
scary‐looking formula), because any capacitor worth its salt will come with 
a documented capacitance value. It just helps to understand that how much 
charge a capacitor’s plates can hold depends on how the capacitor is made.
