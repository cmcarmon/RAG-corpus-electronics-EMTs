Competitive networks are used for clustering; i.e., an M output PE net will seek M clusters in the input space.
The weights of each PE will correspond to the centers of mass of one of the M clusters of input samples. When
a given pattern is shown to the trained net, only one of the outputs will be active and can be used to label the
sample as belonging to one of the clusters. No more information about the input data is preserved.
