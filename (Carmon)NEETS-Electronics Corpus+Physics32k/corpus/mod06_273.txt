This third grid, called a SUPPRESSOR GRID, is placed between the screen grid and the plate. The
suppressor grid is normally connected either internally or externally to the cathode and bears the same
charge as the cathode. This is shown in figure 1-33. Because of its negative potential (relative to
individual electrons), any electrons that are emitted by the plate, through secondary emission, are repelled
back toward the plate.
