; so are eyeglasses. In fact,
eyeglasses might well be the penultimate rehabilitation device. They are inexpensive, have little social stigma,
and are almost completely unobtrusive to the user. They have let many millions of individuals with correctable
vision  problems  lead  productive  lives.  But  in  essence,  a  pair  of  eyeglasses  is  an  optical  device,  governed  by
traditional  equations  of  physical  optics.  Eyeglasses  can  be  made  out  of  simple  glass  (from  a  raw  material  as
abundant as the sands of the earth) or complex plastics such as those that are ultraviolet sensitive. They can
be ground by hand or by sophisticated computer-controlled optical grinders. Thus, crude technology can restore
functional  vision.  Increasing  the  technical  content  of  the  eyeglasses  (either  by  material  or  manufacturing
method) in most cases will not increase the amount of function restored, but it might make the glasses cheaper,
lighter, and more prone to be used.
