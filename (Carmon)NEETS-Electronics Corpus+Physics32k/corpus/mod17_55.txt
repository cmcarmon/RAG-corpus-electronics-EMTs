Facsimile (fax) is the process used to transmit photographs, charts, and other graphic information 
electronically. The image to be transmitted is scanned by a photoelectric cell. Electrical changes in the 
cell output, corresponding to the light and dark areas being scanned, are transmitted to the receiver. At the 
receiver, the signal operates a recorder that reproduces the picture. The fax signals may be transmitted 
either by landline or radio.
