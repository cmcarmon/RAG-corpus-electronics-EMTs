Strip  detectors  are  well  established  in  high-energy  physics  experiments  for  reconstruction  on  the  micron
scale  of  the  tracks  of  ionizing  particles.  The  particles  being  tracked  result  from  the  collision  of  accelerated
particles with a target and are highly energetic (>1010 eV). Frequently, experimental interest is focused on short-
lived particles created in the collision but which decay before they can be directly detected. Spatial resolution
of the decay vertex from the original collision is necessary to detect such a particle and to determine its lifetime.
The requirements of new high-energy experiments and advances in silicon technology have produced much
evolution and innovation in the strip detector concept. For example, a double-sided microstrip detector with
an oxide-nitride-oxide capacitor dielectric Ô¨Ålm has been reported [29]. The use of intermediate strips to improve
spatial resolution has become common [30], and the biasing network has been integrated onto the detector [31].
