A buffer routine or storage medium used in telecommunications compensates for a difference in rate of flow of data, or time of occurrence of events, when transferring data from one device to another.
Buffers are used for many purposes, including:
Interconnecting two digital circuits operating at different rates,
Holding data for later use,
Allowing timing corrections to be made on a data stream,
Collecting binary data bits into groups that can then be operated on as a unit,
Delaying the transit time of a signal in order to allow other operations to occur.
