(13.3.13)
where δgs is the angular difference between δg and δs, and X = Xd + Xe, with Xd being the
direct-axis reactance of the synchronous generator. The power angle characteristic given by
Equation (13.3.13) is plotted in Figure 13.3.6. The peak of the power-angle curve, given by
Pmax, is known as the steady-state power limit (shown by point b in Figure 13.3.6), representing
the maximum power that can theoretically be transmitted in a stable manner. A machine is
usually operated at less than the power limit (such as at point a in Figure 13.3.6), thereby
leaving a steady-state margin, as otherwise even a slight increase in the angle δgs (such as at
point c in Figure 13.3.6) would lead to instability. Installing parallel transmission lines [which
effectively reduces X in Equation (13.3.13)] or adding series capacitors in lines raises the stability
limit.
