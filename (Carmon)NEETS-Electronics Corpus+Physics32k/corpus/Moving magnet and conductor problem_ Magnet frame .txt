In the rest frame of the magnet, the magnetic field is some fixed field B(r), determined by the structure and shape of the magnet. The electric field is zero.
In general, the force exerted upon a particle of charge q in the conductor by the electric field and magnetic field is given by (SI units):





F

=
q
(

E

v

B

)
,


{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =q(\mathbf {E} +\mathbf {v} \times \mathbf {B} ),}

where



q


{\displaystyle q}
is the charge on the particle,




v



{\displaystyle \mathbf {v} }
is the particle velocity and F is the Lorentz force. Here, however, the electric field is zero, so the force on the particle is





F

=
q

{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} =q\mathbf {v} \times \mathbf {B} .}
