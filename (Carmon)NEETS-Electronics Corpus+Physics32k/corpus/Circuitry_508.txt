Microcontrollers 
 
A microcontroller  is  a  single-chip  microcomputer 
that is designed specifically for control rather than 
general-purpose  applications.  They  are  often  used 
to satisfy a particular control requirement, such as 
controlling  a  motor  drive.  Single-chip  micro-
computers,  on  the  other  hand,  usually  perform  a 
variety  of  different  functions  and  may  control 
several processes at the same time.   
  Typical applications include control of peripheral 
devices such as motors, drives, printers, and minor 
sub-system  components.  Typical  examples  are  the 
Z86E, 8051, 68705 and 89C51.
