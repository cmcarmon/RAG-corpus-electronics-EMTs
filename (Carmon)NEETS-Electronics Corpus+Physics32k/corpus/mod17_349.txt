The start unit precedes the first intelligence unit and is always a space signal. Its purpose is to start 
the receiving machine. The stop unit follows the last code unit and is always a mark signal. Its purpose is 
to stop the receiving machine in preparation for receiving the next character. The start unit must be equal 
to at least one unit of the code. The standard mode uses a stop unit that is 1.42 times the length of one 
intelligence unit. It is common practice to refer to a code unit as an element and to use the terms 
interchangeably. You will also hear duration of a unit referred to as the unit interval.
