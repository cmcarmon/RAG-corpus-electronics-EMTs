Example 13.3.
  Figure  13.7  shows  the  phase-locked  loop  circuit.  The  phase
detector and voltage-controlled oscillator are modeled in separate subcircuits. Examine the VCO subcircuit and
note the PULSE-type current source ISTART connected across the capacitor. The source gives a current pulse
03.E-6 s wide at the start of the simulation to start the VCO running. To start a transient simulation SPICE
 on the capacitors). As this DC point is a

valid, although not necessarily stable, solution, an oscillator will remain at this point indeﬁnitely unless some
perturbation is applied to start the oscillations. Remember, this is an ideal mathematical model and no noise
