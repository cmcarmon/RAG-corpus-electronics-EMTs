Moneyline odds are favoured by American bookmakers. The figure quoted is either positive or negative.
When moneyline odds are positive, the figure indicates how much money will be won on a $100 wager (this is done for an outcome that is considered less likely to happen than not). For example, a net payout of 4/1 would be quoted as +400.
When moneyline odds are negative, the figure indicates how much money must be wagered to win $100 (this is done for an outcome is considered more likely to happen than not). For example, a net payout of 1/4 would be quoted as -400.
Moneyline odds are often referred to as American odds. Moneyline refers to odds on the straight-up outcome of a game with no consideration to a point spread. In most cases, the favorite will have negative moneyline odds (less payoff for a safer bet) and the underdog will have positive moneyline odds (more payoff for a risky bet). However, if the teams are evenly matched, both teams can have a negative line at the same time (e.g. -110 -110 or -105 -115), due to house take.
