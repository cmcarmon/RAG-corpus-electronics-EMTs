In the voiced case, where {en} is modeled as a periodic DT
impulse train, the normal equations are used without modi-
ﬁcation except that the statistical autocorrelations must be
replaced by long-term time averages because the speech wave-
form is deterministic. This approach can be shown to produce
unbiased results as the pitch period becomes inﬁnite. Generally
speaking, the analysis works satisfactorily for voiced speech for
most pitch ranges encountered in applications although per-
formance predictably degrades for very high-pitched utter-
ances that are more typical of women’s and children’s voices
(Deller et al., 2000).
