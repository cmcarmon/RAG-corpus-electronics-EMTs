 i cause no current to flow through the diode. However,
negative excursions result in a flow of diode current and a subsequent negative voltage (eo) to be
developed across R1 and C2. Between peak negative voltage excursions of the ei wave, capacitor C2
discharges through R1. Thus, the eo waveform is a negative video pulse with sloping edges and
