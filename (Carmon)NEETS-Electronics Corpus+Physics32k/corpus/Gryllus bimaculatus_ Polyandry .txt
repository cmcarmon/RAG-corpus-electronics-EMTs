Females prefer to mate with certain males more than others. Females show a distinct preference for mating with new males. Female G. bimaculatus mate with at least two males before zygote production occurs.
Polyandry is a costly reproductive system for females because they put a lot of time, energy and resources into producing eggs. It is not as costly for males because they can produce a larger amount of sperm for less time, energy and resources. Males can also fertilize many eggs in one mating. However, polyandry is still evolved in crickets because it provides benefits that outweigh the costs. It allows females to mate with males that have more desirable traits than previous mates, which is beneficial to offspring success. This multiple mate system allows new combinations of genes to come together, which results in more genetic variation in the population. It also allows females to avoid mating with infertile males. Two mechanisms that allow polyandry to be advantageous agents for increasing males' fitness are sperm competition and male guarding behavior.
