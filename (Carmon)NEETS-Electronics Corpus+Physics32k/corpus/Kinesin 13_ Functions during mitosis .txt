The major function of mitosis is to separate replicated sister chromatids, and this is accomplished in part during anaphase A when "kinetochore microtubules (or kMTs)" that link the sister chromatids to opposite spindle poles shorten by depolymerization, exerting forces on the chromatids that pull them to the poles. In Drosophila there is evidence that sister chromatids are moved to opposite spindle poles by a "kinesin-13 dependent pacman-flux mechanism" in which one kinesin-13 isoform, KLP59c, localized to kinetochores facilitates the depolymerization of the end of the kMTs facing the chromatid (pacman), whereas a second kinesin-13 isoform, KLP10A, localized on the spindle poles facilitates the depolymerization of the opposite end of the kMTs facing the poles (flux)
