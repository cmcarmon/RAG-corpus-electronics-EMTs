Rate Adaptive Pacing
An important feature of modern pacemakers is their ability to modulate the heart rate based on the metabolic
needs of the body. There are many conditions that call for heart rate modulation, such as exercise, fever, stress,
or sleep. Because it is under neural control, the ideal rate modulator is a normally functioning sinus node. In
the case that the patient has atrioventricular conduction problems, the sinus node and the atria may still be
functional; therefore, atrial sensing may be used by the pacemaker to regulate the ventricular rate. Patients with
sinus  node  disease  or  atrial  arrhythmias,  however,  require  an  artiﬁcial  means  of  regulating  heart  rate.  Many
attempts have been made to design metabolic sensors that can be used to naturally modulate the heart rate.
Control variables tested include blood pH [Cammilli, 1977], blood temperature [Alt et al., 1986], venous blood
oxygen  saturation  [Eityzgrlf  et al.,  1982],  respiratory  rate  [Rossi  et al.,  1983],  minute  ventilation  [Alt  et al.,
1987], vibration [Anderson et al., 1983], acceleration [Matula et al., 1992], right ventricular pressure [Yee and
Bennett, 1995], and QT interval [Donaldson and Rickards, 1983]. The ideal sensor would be reliable, have low
current drain, require no additional surgery, and accurately reﬂect metabolic needs. All of the above sensors
could potentially be used to reﬂect metabolic needs; however, only a few are currently practical and in use. The
most common sensors in pacemakers today are the activity sensors, which attempt to indicate activity level by
