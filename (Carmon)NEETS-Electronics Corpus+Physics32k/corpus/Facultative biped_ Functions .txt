In lizards, facultative bipedalism occurs as a result of rapid acceleration caused by the location of the lizardsâ€™ hind legs which induces a friction from the ground to produce a reaction force on the rear legs, effectively creating a turning moment about the lizards center of mass and allowing it to lift off the ground over short distances as a mechanism to evade oncoming predators.
In primates, bipedal movements consist of an irregular, shuffling gait, accomplished by rotating the hip and making short steps, which are constrained by wide pelvis shapes and short hind limbs; primates, such as gelada baboons, use bipedalism to free up their hands for feeding or fighting.
