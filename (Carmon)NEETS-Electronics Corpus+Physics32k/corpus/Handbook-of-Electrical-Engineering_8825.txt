Note that in this sense, a list is a unary tree. Binary trees used as searchtrees access ﬁnite ordered sets.
A binary searchtree is a tree that accesses a set. A tree t accesses a set s if the root of t is some element a of
s, and s1, called the left subtree of t, accesses the subset {x*x ˛ s and x < a} and s2, called the right subtree of t,
accesses the subset {x*x ˛ s and x > a}.
