Healthcare Codes and Standards
The healthcare delivery system is a highly regulated industry. Numerous governmental and nongovernmental
organizations have established codes and standards intended to promote safe and effective patient care. Although
there can be signiÔ¨Åcant differences in the regulatory environment from one hospital to another, the major codes
and standards are relatively uniform.
