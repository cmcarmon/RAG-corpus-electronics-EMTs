For ﬁeld-effect devices, the potential under the gate may be obtained either by setting the gradient of the
potential near the semiconductor-oxide interface equal to the gradient of potential inside the oxide [Kasai et al.,
1982], or by solving Laplace’s equation in the oxide layer, or by assuming a Dirichlet boundary condition at
the oxide-gate interface and determining the potential at the semiconductor-oxide interface as:
