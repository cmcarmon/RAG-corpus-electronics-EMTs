As the term implies, industrial ecology is concerned with the evolution of technology and economic systems
such  that  human  economic  activity  mimics  a  mature  biological  system  from  the  standpoint  of  being  self-
contained in its material and resource use. In such a system, little if any virgin material input is required, and
little if any waste that must be disposed of outside of the economic system is generated. Energetically, the system
can be open, just as biological systems are, although it is likely that overall energy consumption and intensity
will be limited.
