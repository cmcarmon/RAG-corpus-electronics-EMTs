that signal. For example, suppose you create an infrared transmitter and the 
light from that transmitter is supposed to pulse at 40,000 cycles per second 
(also known as 40 kHz). If you connect a frequency counter to the output of 
the circuit, you can verify that the circuit is indeed producing pulses at  
40 kHz â€” not 32 kHz, 110 kHz, or some other Hz.
