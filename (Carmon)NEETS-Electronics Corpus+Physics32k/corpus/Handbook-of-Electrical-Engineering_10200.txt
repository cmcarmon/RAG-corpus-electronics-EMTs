It  should  be  noted  that  arc  welding,  like  many  manufacturing  processes,  is  not  well  enough  understood
physically that one can formulate an exact mathematical model to describe the process. Attempts to optimize
welding schedules for any arc welding process have led to expert systems for such processes [Tonkay and Knott,
1989].  Other  examples  of  such  work  can  be  found  in  publications  of  the Welding  Journal  [e.g.,  Lucas,  1987;
Fellers, 1987].
