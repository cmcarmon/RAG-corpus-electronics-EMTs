The  detection  of 
linear 
integrated  circuits  can  be  rather  more  difficult. 
However,  a  good  starting  point 
that  of 
disconnecting  the  supply  and  inserting  a  meter  to 
determine 
the  supply  current  under  quiescent 
conditions. The value should be compared with that 
given by the manufacturer as ‘typical’. Where there 
is a substantial deviation from this figure the device 
(or  its  immediate  circuitry)  should  be  considered 
suspect.
