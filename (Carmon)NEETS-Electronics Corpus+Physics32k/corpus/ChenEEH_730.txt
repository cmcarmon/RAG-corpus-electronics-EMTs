The memory cost increases when lowering the cycle budget
(see Figure 2.16). When lowering the cycle budget, a more
energy consuming and more complex (larger) memory archi-
tecture is needed to deliver the required bandwidth. Note that
the lower cycle budget is not obtained by reducing the number
of memory accesses, as in the case of the algorithmic changes
and data-ﬂow transformations (discussed in Section 2.4).
These high-level code transformation related optimizations
can be performed platform- and cycle-budget independent,
prior to the trade-off that is the focus here. Therefore, during
the currently discussed step in the system design trajectory, the
amount of data transferred to the data-path remains equal
over the complete cycle budget range. Nevertheless, some
control ﬂow transformations and data reuse optimizations
can be beneﬁcial for energy consumption and not for the
cycle budget (or vice versa). These type of optimizations still
have to be considered in the trade-off.
