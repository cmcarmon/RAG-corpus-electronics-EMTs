Although the capital costs of an underground power cable are usually several times those of an overhead line
of equal capacity, installation of underground cable is continuously increasing for reasons of safety, security,
reliability,  aesthetics,  or  availability  of  right-of-way.  In  heavily  populated  urban  areas,  underground  cable
systems are mostly preferred.
