Every memory request issued by the CPU requires an address translation, which in turn requires an access
to the page table stored in memory. A translation lookaside buffer (TLB) is used to reduce the number of page
table lookups. The most frequent virtual-to-physical mappings are kept in the TLB, which is a small associative
memory tightly coupled with the CPU. If the needed mapping is found in the TLB, the translation is performed
quickly and no access to the page table needs to be made. Virtual memory allows systems to run larger or more
programs than are able to Ô¨Åt in main memory, enhancing the capabilities of the system.
