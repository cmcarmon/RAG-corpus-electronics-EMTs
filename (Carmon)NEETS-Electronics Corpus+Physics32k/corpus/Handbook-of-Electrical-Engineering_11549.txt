The actual FDTD calculations may be excited in different ways. Most commonly the electric ﬁelds on one
or more mesh edges are determined by an analytical function of time, such as a Gaussian pulse or sine wave.
This then acts as a driven voltage source. This may be used to excite an antenna. For example, a short monopole
antenna on a rectangular box may approximate a portable telephone. This monopole antenna could be driven
by a drive voltage source located on the mesh edge at the monopole base next to the top of the box. Both Kunz
and Luebbers [1993] and Taﬂove [1995] describe methods for modeling RF sources. A variety of FDTD sources,
including current sources, are described in Piket-May et al. [1994]. Alternatively a plane wave may be incident
on the object as the excitation source.
