voltage and current ranges, 9 V d.c. power supply 
(or  battery),  3.9  V  zener  diode  (e.g.  BZX85  or 
BZY88),  NPN  TO5  transistor  (e.g.  2N3053  or 
BFY50),  48Â°C/W  TO5  clip-on  heatsink,  220  G
0.3W resistor, 15 G 0.3W resistor, 500 G and 1 kG
wirewound  variable  resistors,    connecting    wire, 
test leads, .
