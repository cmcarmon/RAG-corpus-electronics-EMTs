Often, two-port networks will be cascaded in a receiver. For
instance, several LNAs may be required to boost a received
signal to a sufﬁcient level that it can be down-converted. In this
case, the designer may be interested in the overall effect of
cascading each two-port network. The total effective noise
temperature and noise ﬁgure of n cascaded two-ports can be
found using:
