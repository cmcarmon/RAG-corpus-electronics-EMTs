Polyimides (kaptons), as nylons (polyamides), have nitrogen in their molecular structure. They constitute a
class of high-temperature thermoplastics that may be exposed to continuous operation at 480(cid:176)F. When glass-
reinforced, they may be exposed to temperatures as high as 700(cid:176)F; they are used in molded, extruded wire, and
Ô¨Ålm form.
