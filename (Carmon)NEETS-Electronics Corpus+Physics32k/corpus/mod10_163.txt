When light is reflected from a mirror, the angle of reflection of each ray equals the angle of
incidence. When light is reflected from a piece of plain white paper, however, the reflected beam is
scattered, or DIFFUSED, as shown in figure 1-21. Because the surface of the paper is not smooth, the
reflected light is broken up into many light beams that are reflected in all directions.
