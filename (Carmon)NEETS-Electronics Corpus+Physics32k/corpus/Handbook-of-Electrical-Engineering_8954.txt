same  as  the Touchscreen  input  device,  and  this  discussion  concentrates  on  the  technologies  used  for  Touch-
screens.  There  are  Ô¨Åve  different  technologies  used  for  touch  input  devices,  which  are  capacitive  or  resistive
overlays, piezoelectric, light beam interruption, and surface acoustic wave. The system may be divided into the
sensor unit, which senses the location of the pointing element, and the controller that interfaces with the sensor
and communicates the location information to the system computer. Since the controller is an electronic device
that does not use technology different from the computer it is not covered here. The main differences among
the different touch input devices are due to the choice of sensor technology, and the discussion concentrates
on these technologies.
