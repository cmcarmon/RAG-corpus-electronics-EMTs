The transmission path that results from the rate of refraction is not the only factor that determines the 
luf. As a frequency is lowered, absorption of the radio wave increases. A wave whose frequency is too 
low is absorbed to such an extent that it is too weak for reception. Likewise, atmospheric noise is greater 
at lower frequencies; thus, a low-frequency radio wave may have an unacceptable signal-to-noise ratio.
