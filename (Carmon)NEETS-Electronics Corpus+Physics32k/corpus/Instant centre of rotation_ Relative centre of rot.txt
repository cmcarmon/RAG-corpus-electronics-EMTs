If two planar rigid bodies are in contact, and each body has its own distinct centre of rotation, then the relative centre of rotation between the bodies has to lie somewhere on the line connecting the two centres. As a result, since pure rolling can only exist when the centre of rotation is at the point of contact (as seen above with the wheel on the road), it is only when the point of contact goes through the line connecting the two rotation centres that pure rolling can be achieved. This is known in involute gear design as the pitch point, where there is no relative sliding between the gears. In fact, the gearing ratio between the two rotating parts is found by the ratio of the two distances to the relative centre. In the example in Sketch 4 the gearing ratio is
