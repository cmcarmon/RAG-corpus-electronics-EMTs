A pin on disc tribometer consists of a stationary "pin" under an applied load in contact with a rotating disc. The pin can have any shape to simulate a specific contact, but spherical tips are often used to simplify the contact geometry. Coefficient of friction is determined by the ratio of the frictional force to the loading force on the pin.
The pin on disc test has proved useful in providing a simple wear and friction test for low friction coatings such as diamond-like carbon coatings on valve train components in internal combustion engines.
