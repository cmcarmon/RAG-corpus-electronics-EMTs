The Klann mechanism uses six links per leg, whereas the Jansen's linkage developed by Theo Jansen uses eight links per leg, with one degree of freedom. It can walk only on even surfaces and terrain. The number of links in the Jansen mechanism is greater than in the Klann mechanism, and is more costly.
The Klann linkage can walk on non-planar roads and hill areas, and on uneven surfaces and terrain. The design of the Klann mechanism is portable with less linkage for movement. Friction is required for motion between the legs and surface so it can hold, otherwise it will slip.
