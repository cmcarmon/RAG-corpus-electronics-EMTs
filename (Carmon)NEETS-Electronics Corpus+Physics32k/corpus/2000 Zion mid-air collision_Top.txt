On 8 February 2000 a Zlin 242L light aircraft piloted by Chicago radio personality Bob Collins was involved in a mid-air collision with a Cessna 172P over Zion, Illinois while both aircraft were on approach to land at the nearby Waukegan National Airport. The Zlin dived and crashed through the roof of a five-story medical building. The Cessna spiraled down and crashed onto a residential street three blocks away. All three people on board both aircraft were killed and five people on the ground were injured.
The crash was instrumental in effecting changes at Waukegan National Airport and on 24 March 2000 the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) announced that the control tower would receive a Terminal Automated Radar Display and Information System.
