where s(n) is the output and u(n) is the input (perhaps unknown). The model parameters are a(k) for k = 1,
p,  b(l)  for  l  =  1,  q,  and  G.  b(0)  is  assumed  to  be  unity.  This  model,  described  as  an  autoregressive  moving
average (ARMA) or pole-zero model, forms the foundation for the analysis method termed linear prediction.
An autoregressive (AR) or all-pole model, for which all of the “b” coefﬁcients except b(0) are zero, is frequently
used for speech analysis [Markel and Gray, 1976].
