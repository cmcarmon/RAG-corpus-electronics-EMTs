Any Pâ€“N junction diode can emit light when sub-
ject to an electrical current flow. The light is produced 
when the free electrons combine with holes, and the 
extra energy is released in the form of light. The fre-
quency of the light emitted is determined by the type 
of semiconductor material used in construction of the 
diode. Regular diodes do not emit light because of the 
opaque material used in their packaging.
