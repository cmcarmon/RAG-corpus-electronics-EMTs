A  conventional  ohmmeter  can  help  detect  a 
 defective transistor in an out-of-circuit test. Resistance 
tests are made between the two junctions of a transis-
tor in the following way: emitter to base, collector to 
base, and collector to emitter. In testing the transistor, 
the resistance is measured between any two terminals 
with the meter leads connected one way. The meter 
leads are then reversed. In one-meter connection, the 
resistance should be high, 10,000 ohms or more. In 
the other meter connection, the resistance should be 
lower, less than 10,000 ohms.
