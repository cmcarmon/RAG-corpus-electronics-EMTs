Now, let us find the Norton equivalent circuit for Network A. Referring to Figure 3.94,
the short-circuit current isc is V/R1. Therefore, the Norton equivalent network is as
shown on the right-hand side of Figure 3.93.
The v i curve of the circuit must pass through points (voc, 0) and (0,−isc), as
shown in Figure 3.95.
Let us now analyze Network B. Turning off the current source results in the circuit
shown in Figure 3.92, which yields R1R2/(R1 + R2) as the equivalent resistance for both
the Thévenin and Norton equivalent networks. The open-circuit voltage is IR1(cid:2)R2.
Thus, voc = R1R2I/(R1 + R2). As illustrated in Figure 3.96, all of the current will flow
through the branch with zero resistance, that is isc = I.
The equivalent networks are shown in Figure 3.97, and the v i characteristics are
shown in Figure 3.98.
