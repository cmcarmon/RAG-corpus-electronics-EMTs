† Using equatorial radius and assuming body is spherical
‡ Using three radii and assuming body is spheroid
* Radius is known only very approximately
R Radius has been determined by various methods, such as optical (Hubble), thermal (Spitzer), or direct imaging via spacecraft
9 Unknown radius, generic assumed albedo of 0.09
$ Well studied asteroid or moon whose dimensions and mass are very well known. Asteroid sizes and masses taken from James Baer's (Bio) personal website.
M Mass has been determined by perturbation. For asteroids, see James Baer's personal website.
Note: For many of the well-determined moons, radii were taken from the JPL Solar System Dynamics page.
O Radius has been determined by an occultation
