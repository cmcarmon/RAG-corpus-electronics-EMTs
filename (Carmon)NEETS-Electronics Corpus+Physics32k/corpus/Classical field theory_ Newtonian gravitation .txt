The first field theory of gravity was Newton's theory of gravitation in which the mutual interaction between two masses obeys an inverse square law. This was very useful for predicting the motion of planets around the Sun.
Any massive body M has a gravitational field g which describes its influence on other massive bodies. The gravitational field of M at a point r in space is found by determining the force F that M exerts on a small test mass m located at r, and then dividing by m:





g

(

r

)
=




F

(

r

)

m


.


{\displaystyle \mathbf {g} (\mathbf {r} )={\frac {\mathbf {F} (\mathbf {r} )}{m}}.}

Stipulating that m is much smaller than M ensures that the presence of m has a negligible influence on the behavior of M.
According to Newton's law of universal gravitation, F(r) is given by

{\displaystyle \mathbf {F} (\mathbf {r} )=-{\frac {GMm}{r^{2}}}{\hat {\mathbf {r} }},}

is a unit vector pointing along the line from M to m, and G is Newton's gravitational constant. Therefore, the gravitational field of M is

{\displaystyle \mathbf {g} (\mathbf {r} )={\frac {\mathbf {F} (\mathbf {r} )}{m}}=-{\frac {GM}{r^{2}}}{\hat {\mathbf {r} }}.}

The experimental observation that inertial mass and gravitational mass are equal to unprecedented levels of accuracy leads to the identification of the gravitational field strength as identical to the acceleration experienced by a particle. This is the starting point of the equivalence principle, which leads to general relativity.
For a discrete collection of masses, Mi, located at points, ri, the gravitational field at a point r due to the masses is

{\displaystyle \mathbf {g} (\mathbf {r} )=-G\sum _{i}{\frac {M_{i}(\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {r_{i}} )}{|\mathbf {r} -\mathbf {r} _{i}|^{3}}}\,,}

If we have a continuous mass distribution ρ instead, the sum is replaced by an integral,

Note that the direction of the field points from the position r to the position of the masses ri; this is ensured by the minus sign. In a nutshell, this means all masses attract.
In the integral form Gauss's law for gravity is

while in differential form it is

{\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \mathbf {g} =-4\pi G\rho _{m}}

Therefore, the gravitational field g can be written in terms of the gradient of a gravitational potential φ(r):





g

.


{\displaystyle \mathbf {g} (\mathbf {r} )=-\nabla \phi (\mathbf {r} ).}

This is a consequence of the gravitational force F being conservative.
