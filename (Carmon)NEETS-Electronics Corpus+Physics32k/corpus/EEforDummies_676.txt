Beginning with bits
When you add two digits together, you have ten choices for each digit (0 
through 9) because that’s how our numbering system (known as a base 10, 
or decimal, system) works. When a computer adds two digits together, it uses 
only two possible digits: 0 and 1 (this is known as a base 2 or binary system). 
Because there are only two, these digits are known as binary digits, or bits. 
Bits can be strung together to represent letters or numbers — for instance, 
the bit string 1101 represents the number 13. The sidebar “Adding bits of 
numbers” offers a glimpse of how this process works.
