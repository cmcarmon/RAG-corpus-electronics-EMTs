In the primary cell the zinc cathode was eaten away by the sulfuric acid. In the secondary cell the 
sponge-like construction of the cathode retains the lead sulfate formed by the chemical action of the 
sulfuric acid and the lead. In the primary cell the carbon anode was not chemically acted upon by the 
sulfuric acid. In the secondary cell the lead peroxide anode is chemically changed to lead sulfate by the 
sulfuric acid.
