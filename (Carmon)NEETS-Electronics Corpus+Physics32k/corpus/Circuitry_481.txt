when the clock changes state. Operation is thus said 
to  be  synchronous.  Additional  subsidiary  inputs 
(which  are  invariably  active  low)  are  provided 
which  can  be  used  to  directly  set  or  reset  the 
bistable.  These  are  usually  called  PRESET  (PR) 
and CLEAR (CLR). D-type bistables are used both 
as latches (a simple form of memory) and as binary 
dividers.  The  simple  circuit  arrangement  in  Fig. 
10.20  together  with  the  timing  diagram  shown  in 
Fig.  10.21 
the  operation  of  D-type 
bistables.
