*13.1.7 A three-phase, wound-rotor induction machine,
with its shaft rigidly coupled to the shaft of a
three-phase synchronous motor, is used to change
balanced 60-Hz voltages to other frequencies at
the wound-rotor terminals brought out through
slip rings. Both machines are electrically con-
nected to the same balanced three-phase, 60-Hz
source. Let the synchronous motor, which has
four poles, drive the interconnecting shaft in the
clockwise direction, and let the eight-pole bal-
anced three-phase stator winding of the induc-
tion machine produce a counterclockwise rotat-
ing Ô¨Åeld, i.e., opposite that of the synchronous
motor. Determine the frequency of the rotor volt-
ages of the induction machine.
