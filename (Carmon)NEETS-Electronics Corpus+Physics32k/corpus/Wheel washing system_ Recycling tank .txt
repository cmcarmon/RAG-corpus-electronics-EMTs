Once the wash sludge arrives to a recycling tank the solids typically sink by gravity to the bottom. To accelerate the sedimentation of the solids, flocculants are used. Periodically the settled solids at the bottom of the recycling tank are removed from the tank with an automatic scraper conveyor system or by other means such as a wheel loader, an excavator with bucket or a vacuum truck. After the solids settlement process the wash water is ready for the next washing cycle. The goal of the sedimentation process is to deliver clean and optically clear water for every wash.
