The Kubo formula is an equation which expresses the linear response of an observable quantity due to a time-dependent perturbation. Among the numerous applications of linear response formula, one can mention charge and spin susceptibilities of, for instance, electron systems due to external electric or magnetic fields. Responses to external mechanical forces or vibrations can also be calculated using the very same formula.
