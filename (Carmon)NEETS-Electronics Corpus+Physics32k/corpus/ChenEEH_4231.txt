Just like the Token Passing Bus protocol, the Token Passing
Ring protocol has a token maintenance problem when a sta-
tion detects no token activity or detects a persistently circulat-
ing busy token by issuing a new token. When a station detects
no token activity for a period of time, the network enters the
initialization procedure to claim a token. A monitor station on
the network sets the monitor bit in the frame. It will then
remove the frame and issue a new token if the monitor station
has seen the monitor bit set. This ring protocol enables a fair
access with a ‘‘round robin’’ scheme, but it is inefﬁcient under
a lightly loaded system because the station that has a frame to
be transmitted has to wait for the token to arrive. Unlike
CSMA/CD, a station can transmit a frame right away as long
as no other station is transmitting. A ring network, however,
