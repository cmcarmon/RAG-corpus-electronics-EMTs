There are several important differences between LDs and LEDs. One is that LEDs usually lack
reflective facets and in some cases are designed to suppress reflections back into the active region.
Another is that lasers tend to operate at higher drive currents to produce light. A higher driver current
results in more complicated drive circuits and more heat dissipation in the device.
