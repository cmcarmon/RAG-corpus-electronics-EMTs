A recent step in the advancement of satellite communications was the start of the DSCS Phase III. 
The first Phase III satellite was launched into orbit by the space shuttle in the summer of 1984. Seven 
satellites will be placed in space during this phase. Figure 4-15 shows a Phase III satellite being tested in a 
simulated space environment, Figure 4-16 shows the Phase III satellite as it appears in space. Phase III 
will develop the use of 40-watt, solid-state amplifiers to replace the currently used traveling-wave tube 
(twt). It will also be used to develop new type filters. These filters will provide increased channel 
bandwidth, which will provide additional communications capacity.
