Apparent longitude is celestial longitude corrected for aberration and nutation as opposed to mean longitude.
Apparent longitude is used in the definition of equinox and solstice. At equinox, the apparent geocentric celestial longitude of the Sun is 0째 or 180째. At solstice, it is equal to 90째 or 270째. This does not match up to declination exactly zero or declination extreme value because the celestial latitude of the Sun is (less than 1.2 arcseconds but) not zero.
