balance equation 8.2 to include the power losses PL. For a
given set of generations Pi, the line losses have to be computed
from the line currents, which in turn require solving the
corresponding power ﬂow equations. Such a problem of opti-
mizing the total generation costs while solving nonlinear
power ﬂow equations is called the optimal power ﬂow formu-
lation, and it will be discussed in the next section. In this
section, we approximate the total line losses PL as a direct
function of the generations Pi using the equation:
