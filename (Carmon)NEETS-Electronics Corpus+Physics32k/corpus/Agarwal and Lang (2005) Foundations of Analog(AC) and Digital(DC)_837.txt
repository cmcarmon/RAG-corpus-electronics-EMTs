Recall that the static discipline for a logic gate guarantees that the outputs
of the gate will meet the output constraints specified by the discipline, provided
its inputs meet the input constraints. Recall, further, that a static discipline
with its associated voltage thresholds is necessary to establish a standardized
representation so that the logic devices from several vendors can operate with
each other correctly. Similarly, a user who wants to build a system can select
the best devices from several vendors provided they meet the voltage thresholds
established by the static discipline adopted by the user.
