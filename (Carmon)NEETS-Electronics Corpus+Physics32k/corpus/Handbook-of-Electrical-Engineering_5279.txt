PV  systems  can  be  ﬂat-plate  or  concentrating  type. While  ﬂat-plate  systems  utilize  the  global  (direct  and
diffuse)  radiation,  concentrator  systems  harness  only  the  direct  or  beam  radiation.  As  such,  concentrating
systems must track (one axis or two axis) the sun. Flat-plate systems may or may not be mounted on trackers.
By  1990,  efﬁciencies  of  ﬂat-plate  crystalline  and  thin-ﬁlm  cells  had  reached  23  and  15%,  respectively.
Efﬁciencies  as  high  as  34%  were  recorded  for  concentrator  cells.  Single-crystal  and  amorphous  PV  module
efﬁciencies  of  12  and  5%  were  achieved  by  the  early  ’90s.  For  an  average  module  efﬁciency  of  10%  and  an
insolation of 1 kW/m
