Implementation of the Multiplication Algorithm
Speed of multiply operation is of utmost importance in digital signal processors (DSP) today as well as in the
general purpose processors. Therefore, research in building a fast parallel multiplier has been going on since
such  a  paper  was  published  by  Wallace  [1964]  in  1964.  In  his  historic  paper,  Wallace  introduced  a  way  of
summing the partial product bits in parallel using a tree of carry-save adders which became generally known
as the “Wallace Tree” (Fig. 86.4).
