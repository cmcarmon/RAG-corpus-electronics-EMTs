dissipate; this value is roughly VCE×ICmax. No need to worry about this 
rating if you’re using the transistor as a switch because power dissipa-
tion is nearly zero anyway. If you’re using the transistor as an amplifier, 
however, you need to be aware of this rating.
If you think your circuit will approach the total power dissipation value, 
be sure you attach a heat sink to the transistor.
