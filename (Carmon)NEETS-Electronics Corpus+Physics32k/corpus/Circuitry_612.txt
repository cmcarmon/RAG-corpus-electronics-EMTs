In  order  to  further  improve  selectivity  (i.e.  the 
ability to discriminate between signals on adjacent 
channels)  several 
tuned  circuits  can  be  used 
together 
to  form  a  more  effective 
in  order 
bandpass  filter. Figure  13.13  shows  one  possible 
arrangement. When constructing an RF filter using 
several  tuned  circuits  it  is  necessary  to  use  the 
optimum coupling between  the two tuned circuits. 
Figure 13.14 illustrates this point.
