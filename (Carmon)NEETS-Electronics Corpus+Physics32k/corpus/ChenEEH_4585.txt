. Ny(k þ 1) is the output of the actual system.
. fy(k þ 1) is the output of the failure dynamics.
. N ^yy(k þ 1) is the output of the nominal model.
. N ~yy(k þ 1) is the remaining uncertainty between the
nominal system and the nominal model.
. nfy(k þ 1) is the output of the online estimator.
. nf ~yy(k þ 1) is the remaining uncertainty between the esti-
mator and the failure dynamics.
