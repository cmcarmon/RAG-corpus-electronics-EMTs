Lutetium is a rare-earth element, with one naturally-occurring stable isotope 175Lu and one naturally-occurring radioactive isotope 176Lu. When 176Lu atoms are incorporated into earth materials, such as rocks and minerals, they began to be "trapped" while starting to decay. Through radioactive decay, an unstable nucleus decays into another relatively stable one. Radiometric dating makes use of the decay relationship to calculate how long the atoms have been "trapped", i.e. the time since the earth material was formed.
