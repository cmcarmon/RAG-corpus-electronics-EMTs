IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission—Geneva, Switzerland) was founded to harmonize electrical
standards  to  increase  international  trade  in  electrical  products.  Any  country  can  become  a  member  and
participate  in  the  standards-writing  activities  of  IEC.  Unlike  CSA  and  UL,  IEC  is  not  a  certifying  body  that
certiﬁes  or  approves  products.  IEC  publishes  consensus  standards  for  national  standards  authorities  such  as
CSA (Canada), UL (USA), BSI (UK) and DIN (Germany) to adopt as their own national standards.
