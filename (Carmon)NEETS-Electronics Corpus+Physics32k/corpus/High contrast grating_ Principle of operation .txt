Fully rigorous electromagnetic solutions exist for gratings, which tends to involve heavy mathematical formulism. A simple analytical formulism to explain the various properties of high contrast grating has been developed. A computational program based on this analytical solution has also been developed to solve the electromagnetic properties of high contrast grating, named High Contrast Grating Solver. The following provides a brief overview of the operation principle of high contrast grating.
The grating bars can be considered as merely a periodic array of waveguides with wave being guided along the grating thickness direction. Upon plane wave incidence, depending on wavelength and grating dimensions, only a few waveguide-array modes are excited. Due to a large index contrast and near-wavelength dimensions, there exists a wide wavelength range where only two waveguide-array modes have real propagation constants in the z direction and, hence, carry energy. The two waveguide-array modes then depart from the grating input plane and propagate downward to the grating exiting plane, and then reflect back up. After propagating through the grating thickness, each propagating mode accumulates a different phase. At the exiting plane, owing to a strong mismatch with the exiting plane wave, the waveguide modes not only reflect back to themselves but also couple into each other. As the modes propagate and return to the input plane, similar mode coupling occurs. Following the modes through one round trip, the reflectivity solution can be attained. The two modes interfere at the input and exiting plane of the high contrast grating, leading to various distinct properties.
