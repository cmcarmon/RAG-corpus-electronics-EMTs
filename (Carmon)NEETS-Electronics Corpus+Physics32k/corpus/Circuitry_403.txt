where RIN is the input resistance (in ohms), VIN is 
the  input  voltage  (in  volts)  and  IIN  is  the  input 
current (in amps). Note that we usually assume that 
the  input  of  an  operational  amplifier  is  purely 
resistive  though  this  may  not  be  the  case  at  high 
frequencies  where  shunt  capacitive  reactance  may 
become significant.  
  The input resistance of operational amplifiers is 
very  much  dependent  on 
the  semiconductor 
technology  employed.  In  practice,  values  range 
from about 2 MG for bipolar operational amplifiers 
to over 1012  G for CMOS devices.
