Regulating transformers are designed to provide a boost in
voltage magnitude along a line or a change in phase. They are
used basically to control the ﬂow of power between two
systems with different sources, or they are used along a tie
feeder between two load centers that are fed by the same bulk
power substation. Phase-regulating transformers are employed
to control the power ﬂow around loops with two or more
sources. They are almost always motor driven and have exten-
sive control and protection systems.
