The core size of single mode fibers is small. The core size (diameter) is typically around 8 to 10
micrometers (�m). A fiber core of this size allows only the fundamental or lowest order mode to
propagate around a 1300 nanometer (nm) wavelength. Single mode fibers propagate only one mode,
because the core size approaches the operational wavelength (ÿ). The value of the normalized frequency
parameter (V) relates core size with mode propagation. In single mode fibers, V is less than or equal to
2.405. When V � 2.405, single mode fibers propagate the fundamental mode down the fiber core, while
high-order modes are lost in the cladding. For low V values (� 1.0), most of the power is propagated in the
cladding material. Power transmitted by the cladding is easily lost at fiber bends. The value of V should
remain near the 2.405 level.
