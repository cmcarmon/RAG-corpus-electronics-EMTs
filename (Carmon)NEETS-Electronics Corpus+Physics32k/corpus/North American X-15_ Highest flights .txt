The FAI set the limit of space at 100 kilometers (62.1 mi). But in the 1960s, the U.S. Air Force considered an altitude of 50 miles (80 km) as the limit of space; U.S. Air Force and NASA pilots and crew exceeding that altitude at the time could be awarded the astronaut badge. Thirteen X-15 flights went higher than 50 miles, two of which exceeded 100 kilometers.
