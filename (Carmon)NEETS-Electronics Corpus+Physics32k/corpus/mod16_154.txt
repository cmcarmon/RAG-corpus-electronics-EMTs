Current measurements are not often taken in the course of preventive maintenance or testing. This is
because the ammeter (or other current-measuring instrument) must become an actual part of the
equipment being tested. The circuit must be opened (desoldered) to connect the ammeter in series with
the circuit being tested. Usually, you can take a voltage measurement and use this factor to calculate the
circuit current by applying Ohmâ€™s law.
