Turning our attention to the internal structure of integrated-circuit (IC) building blocks, we
encounter a new family of circuit elements known as semiconductor devices, which include diodes
and transistors of various kinds. These circuit elements are nonlinear in their iâ€“v characteristics.
Nonlinearity complicates circuit analysis and calls for new methods of attack. However, the
semiconductor devices are extremely important for the electronic circuits.
