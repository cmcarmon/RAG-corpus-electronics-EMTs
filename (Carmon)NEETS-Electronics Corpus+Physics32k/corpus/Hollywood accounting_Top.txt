Hollywood accounting (also known as Hollywood bookkeeping) refers to the opaque or creative accounting methods used by the film, video, and television industry to budget and record profits for film projects. Expenditures can be inflated to reduce or eliminate the reported profit of the project, thereby reducing the amount which the corporation must pay in taxes and royalties or other profit-sharing agreements, as these are based on the net profit.
Hollywood accounting gets its name from its prevalence in the entertainment industryâ€”that is, in the movie studios of Hollywood at a time when most studios were located in Hollywood. Those affected can include writers and actors.
