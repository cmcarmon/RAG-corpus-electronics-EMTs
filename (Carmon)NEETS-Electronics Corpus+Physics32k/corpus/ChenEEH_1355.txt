The key advantage of directory schemes is the ability to
restrict coherency communications to only those absolutely
necessary. There is clearly a trade-off between communication
overhead and directory size and complexity. One possibility
for exploring the trade-off is to use limited directory schemes
(Stenstrom, 1990). In such a scheme, a limit is placed on the
number of directory entries pointing to a particular block.
The protocol either does not allow more than this number
of cache copies of a single line or starts to use broadcasting
after this limit has been reached. Another possibility is to use
a linked-list style structure in which each cache line points
to the next cache to contain a copy of that line. These are
known as chained directory schemes, one example being the
scalable coherent interface (SFI) as described by IEEE (1989).
This approach slows down the coherency communications
because they may have to go through several stages of cache
controller.
