The solstitial colure is the meridian or great circle of the celestial sphere which passes through the poles and the two solstices: the first point of Cancer and the first point of Capricorn. There are several stars closely aligned with the solstitial colure: Pi, Beta, Delta Aurigae, and Theta. This makes the solstitial colure point towards the North Celestial Pole and Polaris.
