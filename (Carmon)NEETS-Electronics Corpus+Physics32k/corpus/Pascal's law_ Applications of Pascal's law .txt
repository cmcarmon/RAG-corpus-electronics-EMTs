The underlying principle of the hydraulic jack and hydraulic press.
Force amplification in the braking system of most motor vehicles.
Used in artesian wells, water towers, and dams.
Scuba divers must understand this principle. At a depth of 10 meters under water, pressure is twice the atmospheric pressure at sea level, and increases by about 100 kPa for each increase of 10 m depth.
Usually Pascal's rule is applied to confined space (static flow), but due to the continuous flow process, Pascal's principle can be applied to the lift oil mechanism (which can be represented as a U tube with pistons on either end). However, the lift height will be in microns because energy will be drained and pressure will be diminished after each impact with the lifting material, but force exerted will be equal.
Applied force in cylinder P1A1.
The underlying principal of hot isostatic pressing
