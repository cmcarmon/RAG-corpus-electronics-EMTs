A practical electromechanical system with losses can be represented by adding on the lossy
portion of the electric system and the lossy portion of the mechanical system modeled externally.
Excluding all types of dissipation and losses makes the energy-conversion part to be lossless or
conservative with a coupling ﬁeld.
Both electric and magnetic ﬁelds store energy, from which useful mechanical forces and
torques can be derived. With a normal working electric ﬁeld intensity of about 3 × 106 V/m, the
stored electric-energy density is on the order of
