Training simulators were originally created as generic systems for introducing operators to the electrical and
dynamic behavior of power systems. Today, they model actual power systems with reasonable Ô¨Ådelity and are
integrated with EMS to provide a realistic environment for operators and dispatchers to practice normal, every-
day operating tasks and procedures as well as experience emergency operating situations. The various training
activities can be safely and conveniently practiced with the simulator responding in a manner similar to the
actual power system.
