r¢ and r denote source and observation points respectively; aj, ajk are unknown constants
associated with the jth basis function (entire domain) or the kth basis function of the jth
subsection  (subdomain);  U(rk)  is  the  unit  sampling  function  which  equals  1  on  the kth
subdomain and is 0 elsewhere; bj(r¢) is the jth basis function; wi(r) is the ith testing function;
d(r – ri) is the Dirac delta function; Q(r) is a positive-definite function of position; and e(r)
is the residual or equation error [from Poggio and Miller in Mitra (1973)].
