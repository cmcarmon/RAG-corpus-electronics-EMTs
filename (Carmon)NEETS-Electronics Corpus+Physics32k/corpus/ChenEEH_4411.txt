To analyze stability robustness, consider the unity feedback
system in Figure 3.1. A basic plant uncertainty representation
is Gp(s) ¼ Gpo(s) þ Da(s), where Gpo(s) is the nominal plant
model and where Da(s) is the additive uncertainty. Other
uncertainty representations include the output multiplicative
uncertainty, Gp(s) ¼ (I þ Do(s))Gpo(s), and the input multi-
plicative one, Gp(s) ¼ Gpo(s)(I þ Di(s)). For design purposes,
it helps to normalize the uncertainty representations. For
example, consider that the real plant is represented with an
output multiplicative uncertainty, and let Do(s) ¼ Wo(s)~DDo(s),
where ~DDo(s)
and stable with
k~DDo(s)k1  1 and where Wo(s) is a frequency-dependent
3.1 will be robustly stable if and only if kToWok1  1.
