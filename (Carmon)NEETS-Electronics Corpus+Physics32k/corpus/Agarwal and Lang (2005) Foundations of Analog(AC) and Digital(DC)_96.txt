8. As discussed in Appendix A, assuming that the rate of change is zero for all time ensures that
voltages and currents can be arbitrary functions of time.
9. The elements in most circuits will satisfy the restriction of non-interaction, but occasionally they
will not. As will be seen later in this text, the magnetic fields from two inductors in close proximity
might extend beyond the material boundaries of the respective inductors inducing significant electric
fields in each other. In this case, the two inductors could not be treated as independent circuit
elements. However, they could perhaps be treated together as a single element, called a transformer,
if their distributed coupling could be modeled appropriately. A dependent source is yet another
example of a circuit element that we will introduce later in this text in which interacting circuit
elements are treated together as a single element.
