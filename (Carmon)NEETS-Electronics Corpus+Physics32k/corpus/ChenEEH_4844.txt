As mentioned previously, digital control systems are much
more sensitive to time delays than are other software applica-
tions. There are three types of timed events that occur in
typical control system: periodic events (such as updating
control signals at a given rate), asynchronous events (such
as set point adjustments from a supervisory control), and
sporadic events (such as a fault occurrence). A long time
delay that is incurred when processing an event could cause
catastrophic behavior, such as instability or failure to recover
from a fault. Making the problem more difÔ¨Åcult to manage
and to analyze is the fact that operations in typical networked
computer systems occur in a nondeterministic manner, giving
rise to varying time delays. The concern over how this non-
deterministic behavior affects different software applications
has prompted a great deal of research in the area of real-time
computing.
