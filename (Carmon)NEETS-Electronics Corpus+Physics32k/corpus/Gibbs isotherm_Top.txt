The Gibbs adsorption isotherm for multicomponent systems is an equation used to relate the changes in concentration of a component in contact with a surface with changes in the surface tension, which results in a corresponding change in surface energy. For a binary system, the Gibbs adsorption equation in terms of surface excess is:

where




γ




{\displaystyle \gamma \,\!}
is the surface tension,

{\displaystyle \Gamma \,\!}
i is the surface excess of component i,




μ




{\displaystyle \mu \,\!}
i is the chemical potential of component i.
