A curious meteorological application of this theorem involves considering the wind as a vector defined at every point continuously over the surface of a planet with an atmosphere. As an idealisation, take wind to be a two-dimensional vector: suppose that relative to the planetary diameter of the Earth, its vertical (i.e., non-tangential) motion is negligible.
One scenario, in which there is absolutely no wind (air movement), corresponds to a field of zero-vectors. This scenario is uninteresting from the point of view of this theorem, and physically unrealistic (there will always be wind). In the case where there is at least some wind, the Hairy Ball Theorem dictates that at all times there must be at least one point on a planet with no wind at all and therefore a tuft. This corresponds to the above statement that there will always be p such that f(p) = 0.
In a physical sense, this zero-wind point will be the center of a cyclone or anticyclone. (Like the swirled hairs on the tennis ball, the wind will spiral around this zero-wind point - under our assumptions it cannot flow into or out of the point.) In brief, then, the theorem dictates that, given at least some wind on Earth, there must at all times be a cyclone or anticyclone somewhere.
Note that the center with zero wind can be arbitrarily large or small. Mathematical consistency dictates the wind forms a cyclonic wind pattern for at least one point on the planet, but this does not require the cyclone be a violent storm.
This is not strictly true as the air above the earth has multiple layers, but for each layer there must be a point with zero horizontal windspeed.
