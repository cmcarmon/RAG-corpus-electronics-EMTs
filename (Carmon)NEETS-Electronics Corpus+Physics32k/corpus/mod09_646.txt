At the end of 200 microseconds, the input voltage again suddenly rises to 100 volts. Since the 
capacitor cannot respond to the 100-volt change instantaneously, the 100-volt change takes place across 
the resistor. This step-by-step action will continue until the circuit stabilizes. After many cycles have 
passed, the capacitor voltage varies by equal amounts above and below the 50-volt level. The resistor 
voltage varies by equal amounts both above and below a 0-volt level.
