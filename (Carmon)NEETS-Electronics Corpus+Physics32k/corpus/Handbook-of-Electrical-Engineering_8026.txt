C system may be checked with an in-circuit emulator (ICE), an expensive
P/

C pin-for-pin in the actual circuit. The ICE typically uses a more
P or 
but effective tool that replaces the

P/
C being developed. The ICE tracks signals (including
powerful computer to mimic the performance of the 
many transients) and can be used to effectively show the behavior of the system, as well as the expected response
from the
