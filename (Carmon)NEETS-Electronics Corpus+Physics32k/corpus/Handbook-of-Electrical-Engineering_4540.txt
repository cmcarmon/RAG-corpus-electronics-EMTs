Similar observations might also be made regarding the coefﬁcients of the DE models but whose multiport
representations describe local rather than global interactions. Because the DE model almost always leads to a
larger,  albeit  less  dense,  direct  matrix,  its  inverse  (or  equivalent)  is  rarely  computed.  It  is  worth  noting  that
there are two widely used approaches for DE modeling, ﬁnite-difference (FD) and ﬁnite-element (FE) methods.
They  differ  primarily  in  how  the  differential  operators  are  approximated  and  the  differential  equations  are
satisﬁed, i.e., in the order of the basis and weight functions, although the FE method commonly starts from a
variational viewpoint, while the FD approach begins from the deﬁning differential equations. The FE method
is generally better suited for modeling problems with complicated boundaries to which it provides a piecewise
linear or higher order approximation as opposed to the cruder stairstep approximation of FD.
