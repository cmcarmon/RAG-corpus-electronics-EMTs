Static electricity is commonly experienced dur-
ing the winter months when the environment is dry. 
Synthetics, especially plastic, are excellent generators 
of static electricity. When a person walks across a vi-
nyl or carpeted floor and touches a metal doorknob or 
other conductor, an electrical arc to ground may result 
and a slight shock is felt. For a person to feel a shock, 
the electrostatic potential must be 3500 to 4000 volts. 
It typically takes 5000 volts to jump one-quarter of 
an inch. Lesser voltages are not apparent to a personâ€™s 
nervous system even though they are present.
