Inductor specifications 
 
Inductor  specifications  normally  include  the  value 
of inductance (expressed in henries, millihenries or 
microhenries), the current rating (i.e. the maximum 
current  which  can  be  continuously  applied  to  the 
inductor  under  a  given  set  of  conditions),  and  the 
accuracy  or  tolerance  (quoted  as  the  maximum 
permissible  percentage  deviation  from  the  marked 
value).  Other  considerations  may 
the 
temperature  coefficient  of  the  inductance  (usually 
expressed  in  parts  per  million,  p.p.m.,  per  unit 
temperature  change),  the  stability  of  the  inductor,
