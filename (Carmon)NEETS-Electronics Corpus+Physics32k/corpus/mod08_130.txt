To eliminate this negative feedback caused by the emitter resistor, some way must be found to 
remove the signal from the emitter. If the signal could be coupled to ground (decoupled) the emitter of the 
transistor would be unaffected. That is exactly what is done. A DECOUPLING CAPACITOR (C3 in 
view B) is placed between the emitter of Q1 and ground (across the emitter resistor). This capacitor 
should have a high capacitance so that it will pass the signal to ground easily. The decoupling capacitor 
(C3) should have the same qualities as the coupling capacitors (C1 and C2) of the circuit. Decoupling 
capacitors are also called bypass capacitors.
