Sometimes feedback that is not desired occurs in an amplifier. This happens at high frequencies and 
limits the high-frequency response of an amplifier. Unwanted feedback also occurs as the result of some 
circuit components used in the biasing or coupling network. The usual solution to unwanted feedback is a 
feedback network of the opposite type. For example, a positive feedback network would counteract 
unwanted, negative feedback.
