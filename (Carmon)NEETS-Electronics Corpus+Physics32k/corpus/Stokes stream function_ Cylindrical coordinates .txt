Consider a cylindrical coordinate system ( ρ , φ , z ), with the z–axis the line around which the incompressible flow is axisymmetrical, φ the azimuthal angle and ρ the distance to the z–axis. Then the flow velocity components uρ and uz can be expressed in terms of the Stokes stream function

{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}u_{\rho }&=-{\frac {1}{\rho }}\,{\frac {\partial \Psi }{\partial z}},\\u_{z}&=+{\frac {1}{\rho }}\,{\frac {\partial \Psi }{\partial \rho }}.\end{aligned}}}

The azimuthal velocity component uφ does not depend on the stream function. Due to the axisymmetry, all three velocity components ( uρ , uφ , uz ) only depend on ρ and z and not on the azimuth φ.
The volume flux, through the surface bounded by a constant value ψ of the Stokes stream function, is equal to 2π ψ.
