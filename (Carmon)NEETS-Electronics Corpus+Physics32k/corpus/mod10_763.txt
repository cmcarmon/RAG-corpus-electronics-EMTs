A vertical quarter-wave antenna several wavelengths above ground produces a high angle of 
radiation that is very undesirable at vhf and uhf frequencies. The most common means of producing a low 
angle of radiation from such an antenna is to work the radiator against a simulated ground called a 
GROUND PLANE. A simulated ground may be made from a large metal sheet or several wires or rods 
radiating from the base of the radiator. An antenna so constructed is known as a GROUND-PLANE 
ANTENNA. Two ground-plane antennas are shown in figure 4-41, views A and B.
