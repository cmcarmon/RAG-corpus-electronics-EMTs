Let us use the Thévenin method to obtain the desired current. To apply the Thévenin
method, we will replace the network to the left of the voltage source (that is, to the left of
(cid:3)
the aa
terminal pair, and depicted in Figure 3.61a) with its Thévenin equivalent network
(depicted in Figure 3.61b). Once this replacement is made, as illustrated in Figure 3.62,
then, the current I1 can be written by inspection as
