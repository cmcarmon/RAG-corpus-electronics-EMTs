The input voltage of an antenna element operating in an array
environment is dependent on the input currents of all other
elements. The linearity constant relating Vi and Ik is called the
mutual impedance Zik. When one excites only the ith element,
with all other currents zero (but all other elements physically
present) from equation 6.219, the result is Vi ¼ IiZii. The Zii is
called the self-impedance of the ith element, operating in the
array environment. Note that the corresponding value, when
the ith antenna is allowed to operate in an isolated manner, is
Vi ¼ IiZin. The Zin is, in general, different from Zii, and they
would be equal to each other only in the limit of zero mutual
coupling.
