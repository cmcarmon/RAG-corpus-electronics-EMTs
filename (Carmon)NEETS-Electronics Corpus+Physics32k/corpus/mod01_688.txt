Personnel should constantly be on the alert for any signs which might indicate a malfunction of
electric equipment. Besides the more obvious visual signs, the reaction of other senses, such as hearing,
smell, and touch, should also make you aware of possible electrical malfunctions. Examples of signs
which you must be alert for are: fire, smoke, sparks, arcing, or an unusual sound from an electric motor.
