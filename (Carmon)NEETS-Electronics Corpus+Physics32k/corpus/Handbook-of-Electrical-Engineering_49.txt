Integrated Circuit Resistors. 
Integrated circuit resistors are classiﬁed into two general categories: semicon-
ductor resistors and deposited ﬁlm resistors. Semiconductor resistors use the bulk resistivity of doped semi-
conductor  regions  to  obtain  the  desired  resistance  value.  Deposited  ﬁlm  resistors  are  formed  by  depositing
resistance ﬁlms on an insulating substrate which are etched and patterned to form the desired resistive network.
Depending on the thickness and dimensions of the deposited ﬁlms, the resistors are classiﬁed into thick-ﬁlm
and thin-ﬁlm resistors.
