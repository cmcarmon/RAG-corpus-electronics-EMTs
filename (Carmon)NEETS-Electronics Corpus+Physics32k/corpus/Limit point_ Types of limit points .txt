If every open set containing x contains infinitely many points of S then x is a specific type of limit point called an ω-accumulation point of S.
If every open set containing x contains uncountably many points of S then x is a specific type of limit point called a condensation point of S.
If every open set U containing x satisfies |U ∩ S| = |S| then x is a specific type of limit point called a complete accumulation point of S.
A point x ∈ X is a cluster point or accumulation point of a sequence (xn)n ∈ N if, for every neighbourhood V of x, there are infinitely many natural numbers n such that xn ∈ V. If the space is Fréchet–Urysohn, this is equivalent to the assertion that x is a limit of some subsequence of the sequence (xn)n ∈ N. The set of all cluster points of a sequence is sometimes called a limit set.
The concept of a net generalizes the idea of a sequence. Let



n
:
(
P
,
≤
)
→
X


{\displaystyle n:(P,\leq )\to X}
be a net, where



(
P
,
≤
)


{\displaystyle (P,\leq )}
is a directed set. The point



a
∈
X


{\displaystyle a\in X}
is said to be a cluster point of the net



n


{\displaystyle n}
if for any neighbourhood



U


{\displaystyle U}
of



a


{\displaystyle a}
and any



p
∈
P


{\displaystyle p\in P}
, there is some



x
≥
p


{\displaystyle x\geq p}
such that



n
(
x
)
∈
U


{\displaystyle n(x)\in U}
, equivalently, if



n


{\displaystyle n}
has a subnet which converges to



a


{\displaystyle a}
. Cluster points in nets encompass the idea of both condensation points and ω-accumulation points. Clustering and limit points are also defined for the related topic of filters.
