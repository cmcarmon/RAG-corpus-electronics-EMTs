(2) During the fault-on period, the system dynamics is
governed by equation 7.79, and the fault-on period is
from time t ¼ 0 through time t ¼ tc. Therefore, we
integrate the equation 7.79 starting from the initial
, vs)T at time t ¼ 0 for a time period
condition (upre
from t ¼ 0 to t ¼ tc. Let us denote the system state at
the end of fault-on period numerical integration at
time t ¼ tc by the clearing state (uc, vc)T .
(3) At time t ¼ tc, the system equations change to the
postfault equation 7.80. Therefore, we integrate the
equation 7.80 starting from the
clearing state
(uc, vc)T at time t ¼ tc for a period of several seconds
to assess whether the system response converges to the
