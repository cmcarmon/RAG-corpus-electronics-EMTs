There are at least two types of variation in the Sun's energy output
In the very long term, astrophysicists believe that the Sun's output increases by about 7% every one billion (109) years.
Shorter-term variations such as sunspot cycles, and longer episodes such as the Maunder Minimum, which occurred during the coldest part of the Little Ice Age.
The long-term increase in the Sun's output cannot be a cause of ice ages.
