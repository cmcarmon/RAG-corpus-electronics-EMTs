The ability of the resistor to dissipate heat depends upon the design of the resistor itself. This ability
to dissipate heat depends on the amount of surface area which is exposed to the air. A resistor designed to
dissipate a large amount of heat must therefore have a large physical size. The heat dissipating capability
of a resistor is measured in WATTS (this unit will be explained later in chapter 3). Some of the more
common wattage ratings of carbon resistors are: one-eighth watt, one-fourth watt, one-half watt, one watt,
and two watts. In some of the newer state-of-the-art circuits of today, much smaller wattage resistors are
used. Generally, the type that you will be able to physically work with are of the values given. The higher
the wattage rating of the resistor the larger is the physical size. Resistors that dissipate very large amounts
of power (watts) are usually wirewound resistors. Wirewound resistors with wattage ratings up to 50
