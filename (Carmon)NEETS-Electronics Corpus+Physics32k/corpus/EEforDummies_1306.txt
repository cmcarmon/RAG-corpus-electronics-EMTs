Remember that when you buy surplus, you don’t get a manufacturer’s 
 warranty. Sometimes that’s because the manufacturer is no longer in 
 business. Although most surplus sellers accept returns if an item is defective 
(unless it says something different in their catalogs), you should always con-
sider surplus stuff as‐is, with no warranty implied or intended (and all that 
other lawyer talk).
