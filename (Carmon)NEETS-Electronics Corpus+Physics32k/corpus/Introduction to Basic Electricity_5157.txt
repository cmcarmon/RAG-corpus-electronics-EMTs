A logic probe contains LEDs that produce a vi-
sual indication of what is occurring at a specific point 
in a digital circuit. A logic probe can indicate a high, 
low, clock, or lack of a signal. It can be used with a 
logic pulser, which looks similar to the logic probe. 
The pulser injects a logic level into a circuit, which 
can be picked up by the logic probe. The logic probe is 
useful for checking signals of various input and output 
pins of a circuit or an IC.
