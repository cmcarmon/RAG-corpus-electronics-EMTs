Angle on the bow is a variation of target angle used by United States Navy submarines. Angle on the bow is measured over an arc of 180°  clockwise from the bow if viewing the starboard side of the target, or counterclockwise from the bow if viewing the port side of the target. Target angles from 0°  to 180°  are reported as "starboard [target angle]", while target angles from 180°  to 360°  are reported as "port [360° -target angle]".
Angle on the bow provided the basis for submarine attack decisions through the world wars. When angle on the bow was less than 90° , the submarine would continue a submerged approach toward the target to launch torpedoes when angle on the bow increased to 90°  indicating the minimum range torpedo launch opportunity for the submarine with the given target course and speed. Unless the target was already within torpedo range, angle on the bow greater than 90°  required the submarine to attempt to surface and run around the target beyond visual range to submerge ahead of the target. As a practical matter, the speed differential required to run around a target meant most warships and ocean liners could not be attacked when angle on the bow was greater than 90° .
Estimation of target angle is based on the observer's visual identification of target features like differentiating the bow from the stern. Dazzle camouflage patterns pictured in the black and white images illustrate a form of ship camouflage attempting to impair an observer's recognition of ship features.
