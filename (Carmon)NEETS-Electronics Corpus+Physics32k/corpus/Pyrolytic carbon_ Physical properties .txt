Pyrolytic carbon samples usually have a single cleavage plane, similar to mica, because the graphene sheets crystallize in a planar order, as opposed to graphite, which forms microscopic randomly oriented zones. Because of this, pyrolytic carbon exhibits several unusual anisotropic properties. It is more thermally conductive along the cleavage plane than graphite, making it one of the best planar thermal conductors available.
Pyrolitic graphite forms mosaic crystals with controlled mosaicities up to a few degrees.
It is also more diamagnetic (χ = −4×10−4) against the cleavage plane, exhibiting the greatest diamagnetism (by weight) of any room-temperature diamagnet. By way of comparison, pyrolitic graphite has a relative permeability of 0.9996, whereas Bismuth has a relative permeability of 0.9998 (table).
