The variable-speed option allows optimum efÔ¨Åciency operation of the turbine over a wide range of wind speeds,
resulting in increased outputs with lower structural loads and stresses. All future utility-grade advanced turbines
are expected to operate in the variable-speed mode and use power electronics to convert the variable-frequency
output to constant frequency with minimal harmonic distortion.
