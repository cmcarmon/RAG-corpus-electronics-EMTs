Figure 16.1.19 shows a three-phase voltage-source inverter circuit, along with the corre-
sponding voltage and current waveforms. The motor connected to terminals A, B, and C can have
wye or delta connection. Operating as a six-step inverter, the inverter generates a cycle of line
or phase voltage in six steps. The following Fourier-series expressions describe the voltages vAB
and vAN:
vAB = 2
vAN = 2
The rms value of the fundamental component of the phase voltage vAN is given by
