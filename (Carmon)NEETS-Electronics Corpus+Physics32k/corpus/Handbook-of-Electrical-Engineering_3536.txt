Timing Analysis
Timing analysis
 checks that the overall design satisﬁes
operating speed requirements and that individual sig-
nals  within  a  design  satisfy  transition  requirements.
Common  signal  transition  requirements,  also  called
times

. For instance, setup and hold
and 
times specify relationships between data and control
signals to ensure that memory devices (level-sensitive
latches or edge-sensitive ﬂip-ﬂops) correctly and reli-
ably  store  desired  data.  The  data  signal  carrying  the
information to be stored in the memory device must
be stable for a period equal to the setup time prior to
the  control  signal  transition  to  ensure  that  the  correct  value  is  sensed  by  the  memory  device. Also,  the  data
signal must be stable for a period equal to the hold time after the control signal transition to ensure that the
memory device has enough time to store the sensed value.
