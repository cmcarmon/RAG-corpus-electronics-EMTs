Displacement-Current Phase Tomography is an imaging modality that relies on the same hardware as ECVT. ECVT does not make use of the real part (conductance component) of the obtained mutual admittance measurements. This component of the measurement is related with the material losses in the region of interest (conductivity and/or dielectric losses). DCPT utilizes the full admittance information by means of the small angle phase component of this complex valued data. DCPT can only be used when the electrodes are excited with AC voltage. It applies only to domains that include material losses, otherwise the measured phase will be zero (real part of the admittance will be zero). DCPT is designed to be used with the same reconstruction algorithms designed for ECVT. Therefore, DCPT can be used simultaneously with ECVT to image the spatial tangent loss distribution of the medium along with its spatial relative permittivity distribution from ECT.
