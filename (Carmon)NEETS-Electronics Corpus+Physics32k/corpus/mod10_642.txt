Directly behind the flashlight (position 0) the radiation measured is minimum. Accordingly, a 0 
value is assigned to this position in the rectangular-coordinate graph (fig. 4-11, view A). This radiation 
remains at minimum until position 4 is reached. Between positions 4 and 6, the measuring device enters 
the flashlight beam. You can see this transition from darkness to brightness easily in view B. Radiation is 
fairly constant between positions 6 and 10. Maximum brightness occurs at position 8, which is directly in 
the path of the flashlight beam. From positions 10 to 12, the measuring device leaves the flashlight beam 
and the radiation measurement falls off sharply. At position 13 the radiation is again at 0 and stays at this 
value back to position 0.
