1848 – William Thomson extends the concept of absolute zero from gases to all substances
1849 – William John Macquorn Rankine calculates the correct relationship between saturated vapour pressure and temperature using his hypothesis of molecular vortices
1850 – Rankine uses his vortex theory to establish accurate relationships between the temperature, pressure, and density of gases, and expressions for the latent heat of evaporation of a liquid; he accurately predicts the surprising fact that the apparent specific heat of saturated steam will be negative
1850 – Rudolf Clausius gives the first clear joint statement of the first and second law of thermodynamics, abandoning the caloric theory, but preserving Carnot's principle
1851 – Thomson gives an alternative statement of the second law
1852 – Joule and Thomson demonstrate that a rapidly expanding gas cools, later named the Joule–Thomson effect or Joule–Kelvin effect
1854 – Helmholtz puts forward the idea of the heat death of the universe
1854 – Clausius establishes the importance of dQ/T (Clausius's theorem), but does not yet name the quantity
1854 – Rankine introduces his thermodynamic function, later identified as entropy
1856 – August Krönig publishes an account of the kinetic theory of gases, probably after reading Waterston's work
1857 – Clausius gives a modern and compelling account of the kinetic theory of gases in his On the nature of motion called heat
1859 – James Clerk Maxwell discovers the distribution law of molecular velocities
1859 – Gustav Kirchhoff shows that energy emission from a black body is a function of only temperature and frequency
1862 – "Disgregation," a precursor of entropy, was defined in 1862 by Clausius as the magnitude of the degree of separation of molecules of a body
1865 – Clausius introduces the modern macroscopic concept of entropy
1865 – Josef Loschmidt applies Maxwell's theory to estimate the number-density of molecules in gases, given observed gas viscosities.
1867 – Maxwell asks whether Maxwell's demon could reverse irreversible processes
1870 – Clausius proves the scalar virial theorem
1872 – Ludwig Boltzmann states the Boltzmann equation for the temporal development of distribution functions in phase space, and publishes his H-theorem
1873 - Johannes Diderik van der Waals formulates his equation of state
1874 – Thomson formally states the second law of thermodynamics
1876 – Josiah Willard Gibbs publishes the first of two papers (the second appears in 1878) which discuss phase equilibria, statistical ensembles, the free energy as the driving force behind chemical reactions, and chemical thermodynamics in general.
1876 – Loschmidt criticises Boltzmann's H theorem as being incompatible with microscopic reversibility (Loschmidt's paradox).
1877 – Boltzmann states the relationship between entropy and probability
1879 – Jožef Stefan observes that the total radiant flux from a blackbody is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature and states the Stefan–Boltzmann law
1884 – Boltzmann derives the Stefan–Boltzmann blackbody radiant flux law from thermodynamic considerations
1888 – Henri-Louis Le Chatelier states his principle that the response of a chemical system perturbed from equilibrium will be to counteract the perturbation
1889 – Walther Nernst relates the voltage of electrochemical cells to their chemical thermodynamics via the Nernst equation
1889 – Svante Arrhenius introduces the idea of activation energy for chemical reactions, giving the Arrhenius equation
1893 – Wilhelm Wien discovers the displacement law for a blackbody's maximum specific intensity
