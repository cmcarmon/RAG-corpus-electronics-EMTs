There are many detrimental effects of extended exposure to reduced gravity that are similar to aging and disease. Some long-duration effects of reduced gravity can be simulated on Earth using bed rest. These effects are discussed below in general but more detailed information can be found on the page "Effect of spaceflight on the human body." The various effects include:
muscle atrophy
deconditioning (e.g. arterial constriction, bone density loss )
symptoms similar to aging or disease
head-ward fluid shifts (headaches, sinus/nasal congestion, facial swelling)
decreased muscle volume
decreased bone strength and fracture
increased fatigue and loss of general strength
decreased locomotor control
motion sickness
vision problems
excessive flatulence
other physical effects
psychological effects
The muscle volume can decrease up to 20% over a six-month mission, and the bone density can decrease at a rate of approximately 1.4% at the hip in a month's time. A study done by Fitts and Trappe examined the effects of prolonged space flight (defined as approximately 180 days) on human skeletal muscle using muscle biopsies. Prolonged weightlessness was shown to cause significant loss in the mass, force, and power production in the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles. Many countermeasures to these effects exist, but thus far they are not sufficient to compensate for the detrimental effects of space travel and astronauts need extensive rehabilitation upon their return to Earth.
