Television (TV): The process of detecting an image and converting it to a serial electronic representation. A
detector  raster  scans  the  image,  producing  a  voltage  proportional  to  the  light  intensity.  The  time  axis
represents the distance along the raster scan. Several hundred horizontal scans make up the image starting
at the top. The raster scan is repeated to provide a continuing sequence of images.
