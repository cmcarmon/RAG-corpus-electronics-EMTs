A tachometer is an instrument that measures the rate at which a shaft is turning. Although
tachometers are installed on machinery, such as generators and engines, you may need to determine the
speed of a rotating machine that is not equipped with a tachometer. In these instances, you will be
required to use a PORTABLE TACHOMETER. Portable hand-held tachometers measure speed by direct
contact with the shaft of the measured unit. Portable tachometers are for use only during testing and
should not be used continuously. The common types of portable tachometers are the CENTRIFUGAL
and the CHRONOMETRIC.
