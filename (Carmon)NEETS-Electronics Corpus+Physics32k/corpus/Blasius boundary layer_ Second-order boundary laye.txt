This boundary layer approximation predicts a non-zero vertical velocity far away from the wall, which needs to be accounted in next order outer inviscid layer and the corresponding inner boundary layer solution, which in turn will predict a new vertical velocity and so on. The vertical velocity at infinity for the first order boundary layer problem from the Blasius equation is

{\displaystyle v=0.86{\sqrt {\frac {\nu U}{x}}}}

Interestingly, the solution for second order boundary layer is zero. The solution for outer inviscid and inner boundary layer are

Again as in the first order boundary problem, any one of the infinite set of eigensolution can be added to this solution. In all the solution
