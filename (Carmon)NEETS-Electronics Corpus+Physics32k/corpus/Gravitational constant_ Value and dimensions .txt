The gravitational constant is a physical constant that is difficult to measure with high accuracy. This is because the gravitational force is extremely weak compared with other fundamental forces.
In SI units, the 2014 CODATA-recommended value of the gravitational constant (with standard uncertainty in parentheses) is:

{\displaystyle G=6.67408(31)\times 10^{-11}{\rm {\ m^{3}\ kg^{-1}\ s^{-2}}}}

This corresponds to a relative standard uncertainty of 4.7×10−5.
The dimensions assigned to the gravitational constant are force times length squared divided by mass squared; this is equivalent to length cubed, divided by mass and by time squared:

{\displaystyle [G]={\frac {[F][L]^{2}}{[M]^{2}}}={\frac {[L]^{3}}{[M][T]^{2}}}}

In SI base units, this amounts to meters cubed per kilogram per second squared:

In cgs, G can be written as G ≈ 6.674×10−8 cm3⋅g−1⋅s−2.
