Unfortunately, getting a valid number for comparison purposes requires an extensive effort at benchmarking.
The advertised performance Ô¨Ågures may be taken as a guide, if the task is similar to the benchmark programs.
If the processor does not pass the comparison with a comfortable margin, however, one should opt for a higher-
performance version of the same chip (if much programming already has been done) or select a clearly superior
other candidate.
