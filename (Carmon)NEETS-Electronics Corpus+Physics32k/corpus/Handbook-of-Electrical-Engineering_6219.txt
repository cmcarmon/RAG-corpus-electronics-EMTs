28 km with 6000 W of ERP at a maximum height of 100 m. The most powerful class, Class C, operates with
maximums of 100,000 W of ERP and heights up to 600 m with a primary coverage radius of over 92 km. The
powers and heights above average terrain (HAAT) for all of the classes are shown in Table 69.5. All classes may
operate at antenna heights above those speciﬁed but must reduce the ERP accordingly. Stations may not exceed
the maximum power speciﬁed, even if antenna height is reduced. The classiﬁcation of the station determines
the allowable distance to other co-channel and adjacent channel stations.
