Stranded wire is much more flexible that solid wire, and you use it in situa-
tions in which the wire will be moved or bent a lot (such as in line cords for 
lamps and the cables you hook up to your home entertainment system). You 
use solid wire in places where you don’t plan to move the wire around, and 
to connect components on breadboards (check out Chapter 15 for more on 
breadboards). It’s easy to insert solid wire into holes in the breadboard, but 
if you try to use a stranded wire, you have to twist the strands to get all of 
them into the hole, and you may break a strand or two in the process (trust 
me — it happens), which could short out the circuit.
