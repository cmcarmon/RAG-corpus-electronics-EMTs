Figure 82.7 shows the major hardware components of a simple microcomputer. The central processing unit
(CPU) is the execution engine of the microcomputer and is most often a microprocessor. One popular family
of  microprocessors  used  as  the  CPU  in  microcomputers  is  manufactured  by  Intel.  These  chips,  with  names
such  as  the  8088,  80286,  80386,  80486,  and  Pentium  are  used  in  microcomputers  such  as  the  IBM  personal
computer.  Another  important  family  of  microprocessors  is  the  Motorola  Power  Pc  series,  which  is  used  in
microcomputers manufactured by Apple Computer [Matloff, 1992].
