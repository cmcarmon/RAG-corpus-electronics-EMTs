The implementation of MS-DOS is closely tied to the
underlying architecture. MS-DOS makes use of a hardware
ROM built into the IBM PC called the basic input output
system. (BIOS). The BIOS contains device drivers for the
standard devices. Whereas UNIX is self-contained with all
device drivers built-in, MS-DOS could just call BIOS proce-
dures to do I/O. In addition, users are free to install their own
drivers for special devices.
