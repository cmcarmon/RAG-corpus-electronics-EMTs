Data communication systems use electronics to transmit information 
encoded in electrical patterns between two or more endpoints. When you 
shop online, your order is transmitted by sending an electrical pattern from 
your data communication device (such as a laptop, smartphone, or tablet) 
over the Internet to a communication system operated by a vendor. With a 
little help from electronic components, you can get electrons to convert your 
materialistic desires into shopping orders â€” and charge the order to your 
credit card.
