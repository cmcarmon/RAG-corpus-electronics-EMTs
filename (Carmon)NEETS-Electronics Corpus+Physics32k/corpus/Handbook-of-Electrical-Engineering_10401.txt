independently developed systems. Signiﬁcantly the Department of Defense has edicted that commercial
standards for electronics and telecommunications are to be utilized in preference to military standards
in order to promote more rapid and lower cost acquisition of state-of-the-art technology. Two additional
motivations for new standards are increased trafﬁc requirements and increased system complexity. C3
applications and users have found signiﬁcant beneﬁt in increasing communication with programmati-
cally unrelated data sources such as databases and sensors. There is an increase in internal communica-
tions  as  well.  Also  systems  have  become  more  complex,  forcing  programs  to  develop  modularized
architectures. Software is replacing hardware as the most complicated component of communications
and  C2  systems  to  design,  build,  and  maintain.  Modularized  architectures  are  required  to  simplify
development and enable insertion of new technologies.
