While  a  wheelchair  user  could  certainly  go  down  a  set  of  steps  (not  recommended),  climbing  steps  in  a
normal  manual  or  electric  wheelchair  is  a  virtual  impossibility.  Ramps  or  lifts  are  engineered  to  provide
accessibility  in  these  cases,  or  special  climbing  wheelchairs  can  be  purchased. Wheelchairs  also  do  not  work
well on surfaces with high rolling resistance or viscous coefﬁcients (e.g., mud, rough terrain, etc.), so alternate
mobility aids must be found if access to these areas is to be provided to the physically disabled. Hand-controlled
cars, vans, tractors, and even airplanes are now driven by wheelchair users. The design of appropriate control
modiﬁcations falls to the rehabilitation engineer.
