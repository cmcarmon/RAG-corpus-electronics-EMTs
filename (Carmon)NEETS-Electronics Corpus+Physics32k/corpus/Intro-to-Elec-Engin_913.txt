(a) Determine the percent voltage regulation of the transformer.
(b) Sketch the corresponding phasor diagram.
(c) If the transformer is used as a step-down transformer at the load end of a feeder whose
impedance is 0.5 + j2.0 , Ô¨Ånd the voltage VS and the power factor at the sending end
of the feeder.
