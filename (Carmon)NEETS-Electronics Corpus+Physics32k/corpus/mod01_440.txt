The material covered in this chapter contains many new terms that are explained as you progress
through the material. The basic dc circuit is the easiest to understand, so the chapter begins with the basic
circuit and from there works into the basic schematic diagram of that circuit. The schematic diagram is
used in all your future work in electricity and electronics. It is very important that you become familiar
with the symbols that are used.
