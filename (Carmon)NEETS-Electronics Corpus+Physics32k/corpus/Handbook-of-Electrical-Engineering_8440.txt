In  the  binary  and  decimal  number  systems,  the  diminished  radix  complement  representations  are  the  1’s
complement  and  9’s  complement,  respectively.  Examples  of  1’s  complement  are  shown  in  Table  86.7  for
comparison  with  those  of  2’s  complement.  Notice  that  in  1’s  complement  there  are  two  representations  for
zero, one for +0 and the other for –0. This fact limits the usefulness of the 1’s complement representation for
computer arithmetic.
