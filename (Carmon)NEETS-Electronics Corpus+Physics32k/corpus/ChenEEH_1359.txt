Failure management in a cluster depends on the cluster
method. Two approaches are often adopted: high-availability
clusters and fault-tolerant clusters. A high-availability cluster
supports migration of services from failed nodes although
partially executed transactions have to be recovered by the
application program. A fault-tolerant cluster guarantees ser-
vice availability by using redundant resources, and there are
facilities to complete partially executed transactions.
