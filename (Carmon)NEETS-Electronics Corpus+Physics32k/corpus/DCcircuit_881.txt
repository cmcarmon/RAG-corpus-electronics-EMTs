Thermocouples, however, can be built from heavy-gauge wire for low resistance, and con-
nected in such a way so as to generate very high currents for purposes other than temperature
measurement. One such purpose is electric power generation. By connecting many thermo-
couples in series, alternating hot/cold temperatures with each junction, a device called a ther-
mopile can be constructed to produce substantial amounts of voltage and current:
