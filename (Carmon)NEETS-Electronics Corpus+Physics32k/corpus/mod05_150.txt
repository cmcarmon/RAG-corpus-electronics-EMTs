Now, consider the relative direction between this current and the current that causes the motor to run. 
First, check the direction the current flows as a result of the generator action taking place (view A of fig.  
2-2). (Apply the left-hand rule for generators which was discussed in the last chapter.) Using the left 
hand, hold it so that the forefinger points in the direction of the magnetic field (north to south) and the 
thumb points in the direction that the black side of the armature moves (up). Your middle finger then 
points out of the paper (toward you), showing the direction of current flow caused by the generator action 
in the black half of the armature. This is in the direction opposite to that of the battery current. Since this 
generator-action voltage is opposite that of the battery, it is called "counter emf." (The letters emf stand 
for electromotive force, which is another name for voltage.) The two currents are flowing in opposite 
directions. This proves that the battery voltage and the counter emf are opposite in polarity.
