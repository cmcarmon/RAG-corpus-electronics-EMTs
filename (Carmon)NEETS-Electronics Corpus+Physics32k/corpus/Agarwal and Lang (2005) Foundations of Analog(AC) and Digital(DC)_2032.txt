Knowing the five constraints, namely the two 0.707 frequencies in addition
to the resonance frequency Ï‰o and the low- and high-frequency asymptotes,
we can guess the form of the frequency response more accurately than that in
Figure 14.8. The five constraints, along with the actual curve, are shown in
Figure 14.12.
