Laser Linearity
Several  factors  limit  the  light-versus-current  (L-I)  linearity  of  directly  modulated  lasers.  Early  work  on  laser
dynamics led to a complete understanding of resonance-enhanced distortion (RD). RD arises from the same
carrier-photon interaction within the laser that is responsible for the relaxation-oscillation resonance.
