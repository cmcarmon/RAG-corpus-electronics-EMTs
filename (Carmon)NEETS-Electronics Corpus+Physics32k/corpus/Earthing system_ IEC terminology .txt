International standard IEC 60364 distinguishes three families of earthing arrangements, using the two-letter codes TN, TT, and IT.
The first letter indicates the connection between earth and the power-supply equipment (generator or transformer):
"T" — Direct connection of a point with earth (Latin: terra)
"I" — No point is connected with earth (isolation), except perhaps via a high impedance.
The second letter indicates the connection between earth or network and the electrical device being supplied:
"T" — Earth connection is by a local direct connection to earth (Latin: terra), usually via a ground rod.
"N" — Earth connection is supplied by the electricity supply Network, either as a separate protective earth (PE) conductor or combined with the neutral conductor.
