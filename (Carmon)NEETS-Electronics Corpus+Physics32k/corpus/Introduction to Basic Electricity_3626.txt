equipment that could be lethal. Figure 36-2 shows two 
2-prong plugs. In one, the prongs are the same width; 
the other shows that one prong is wider than the other 
and is referred to as a polarized plug. The polarized  
plug eliminates the chance of plugging in a device 
andÂ making the chassis hot. The wide prong is plugged 
into the neutral side of the AC power source.
