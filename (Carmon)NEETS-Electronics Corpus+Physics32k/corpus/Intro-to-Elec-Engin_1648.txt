Much of linear control theory is based on the frequency-response formulation of the sys-
tem equations, and several quasi-graphical and algebraic techniques have been developed to
analyze and design linear control systems based on frequency-response methods. Although
frequency-response techniques are limited to relatively simple systems, and apply only to lin-
ear systems in the rigorous mathematical sense, they are still most useful in system design
and the stability analysis of practical systems and can give a great deal of information about
the relationships between system parameters (such as time constants and gains) and system
response.
Once the transfer function of Equation (16.2.3) is developed in terms of the complex frequency
variable s, by letting s = j ω, the frequency-response characteristic and the loop gain GH(jω) can
be determined. The Bode diagram, displaying the frequency response and root-locus techniques,
can be used to study the stability analysis of feedback control systems. The dc steady-state
response, which becomes one component of the step response of the control system, can also
be determined by allowing s to be zero in the transfer function. The step response, in turn, can
be used as a measure of the speed of response of the control system. Thus, the transfer function
obtained from the block diagram can be used to describe both the steady-state and the transient
response of a feedback control system.
