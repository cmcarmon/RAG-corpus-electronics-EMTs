For what combination of inputs does the circuit dissipate the greatest amount of static
power? Determine the static power dissipation for this combination of inputs.
p r o b l e m 11.3 A circuit consists of N inverters, where N (cid:3) 1. Each inverter is
built using a NMOS transistor and a resistor RL. The power supply voltage is VS and
the on resistance of the MOSFETs is RON. The threshold voltage for the MOSFETs
is VT.
