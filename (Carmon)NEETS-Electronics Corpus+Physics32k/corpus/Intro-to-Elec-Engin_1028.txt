Depending on the convenience in a given situation, either Equation (12.4.17) or (12.4.18) can be
used. For the case of a translational electromechanical system consisting of only one-dimensional
motion, say, in the direction of the coordinate x, the torque Te and the angular displacement dÎ¸m
are to be replaced by the force Fe and the linear displacement dx, respectively. Thus,
