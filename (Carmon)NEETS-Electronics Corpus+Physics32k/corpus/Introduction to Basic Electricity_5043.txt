A fourth technique involves using the positive film 
transparency developed in the previous discussion to 
create a screen for screenprinting the printed circuit 
board. A good graphic arts book will cover the making 
of a screen and the screenprinting process in detail. 
Use resist inks or oil base inks when screenprinting the 
layout on the boards. This technique provides the ca-
pability of making many PCBs with the same design.
