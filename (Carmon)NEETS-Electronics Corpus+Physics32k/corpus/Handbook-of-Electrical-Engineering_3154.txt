Current Source Inverter
Contrary to the voltage source inverter where the voltage of the dc link is imposed on the motor windings, in
the current source inverter the current is imposed into the motor. Here the amplitude and phase angle of the
motor voltage depend on the load conditions of the motor. The current source inverter is described in detail
in Section 30.4.
