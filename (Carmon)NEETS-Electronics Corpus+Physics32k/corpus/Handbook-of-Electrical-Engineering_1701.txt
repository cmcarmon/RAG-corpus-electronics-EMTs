pling is quite similar to scanning in analog image formation. The second process is known as 
analog-to-digital conversion,
 is assigned to the amount of energy the
transducer observes at that location. This number is usually proportional to the electrical signal at the output
. Sometimes the
of the transducer. The overall process of sampling and quantization is known as 
digitization process is just referred to as analog-to-digital conversion, or A/D conversion; however, the reader
should remember that digitization also includes spatial sampling.
