together in overlapping beams of light. (NOTE: These are not the primaries used in mixing pigments,
such as in paint.) Furthermore, the COMPLEMENTARY or SECONDARY colors (magenta, yellow, and
cyan) may be shown with equal ease by mixing any two of the primary colors in overlapping beams of
light. Thus, red and green light mixed in equal intensities will make yellow light; green and blue will
produce cyan (blue-green light); and blue and red correctly mixed will produce magenta (a purplish red
light).
