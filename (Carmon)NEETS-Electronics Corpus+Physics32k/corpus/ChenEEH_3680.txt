With enough painstaking experimental work, we could
probably deduce reasonable ‘‘true’’ models for any stationary
utterance of interest. In general, we would expect these models
to require zeros as well as poles in their system functions.
Yet, an all-pole model exists that will at least produce a
model/speech waveform with the correct magnitude spectrum
(Deller et al., 2000), and a waveform with correct spectral
magnitude is frequently sufﬁcient for coding, recognition,
and synthesis.
