p r o b l e m 7.1 Consider
shown in
Figure 7.73. Assume that both MOSFETs operate in the saturation region. Determine
the output voltage VO as a function of the supply voltage VS, the gate voltages VA
and VB, and the MOSFET geometries L1, W1, and L2, W2. Assume that the MOSFET
threshold voltage is VT, and remember, K = KnW/L.
