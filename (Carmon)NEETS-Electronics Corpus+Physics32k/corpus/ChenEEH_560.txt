This diode is turned off from an on-state current
density of 100 A=cm2 with a
turn-off dJ/dt of
100 A=cm2ms. Assuming that all
the excess charge
is removed from the device, Qrr  QF ¼ tF JF . Thus, a
charge of 50 mC is removed from the device. For a diode
with S ¼ 1, the reverse recovery current has a magnitude
of 71 A=cm2 and a duration of 0:7 ms.
