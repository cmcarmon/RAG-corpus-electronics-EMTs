If the atoms of a material are farther apart, as illustrated in figure 1-27 view B, the electrons in the
outer shells will not be equally attached to several atoms as they orbit the nucleus. They will be attracted
by the nucleus of the parent atom only. Therefore, a greater amount of energy is required to free any of
these electrons. Materials of this type are poor conductors and therefore have a high resistance.
