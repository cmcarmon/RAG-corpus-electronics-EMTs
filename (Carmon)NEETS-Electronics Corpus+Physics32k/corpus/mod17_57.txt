Facsimile transmission is not intended to be a replacement for teletypewriter and other general 
methods of transmission. It is an important communications supplement and provides a means of 
handling certain types of graphic and pictorial intelligence by swift communications methods. It is widely 
used by the Navy weather information services and ship and station weather centers to obtain the latest 
weather maps. Chances are the photo you saw in the newspaper was transmitted by facsimile.
