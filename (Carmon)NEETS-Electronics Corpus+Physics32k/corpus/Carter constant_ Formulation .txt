Carter noticed that the Hamiltonian for motion in Kerr spacetime was separable in Boyer–Lindquist coordinates, allowing the constants of such motion to be easily identified using Hamilton-Jacobi theory. The Carter constant can be written as follows:




C
=

p

θ

+

cos

θ

m

)




{\displaystyle C=p_{\theta }^{2}+\cos ^{2}\theta {\Bigg (}a^{2}(m^{2}-E^{2})+\left({\frac {L_{z}}{\sin \theta }}\right)^{2}{\Bigg )}}
,

where




p

θ




{\displaystyle p_{\theta }}
is the latitudinal component of the particle's angular momentum,



E


{\displaystyle E}
is the energy of the particle,




L

z




{\displaystyle L_{z}}
is the particle's axial angular momentum,



m


{\displaystyle m}
is the rest mass of the particle, and



a


{\displaystyle a}
is the spin parameter of the black hole. Because functions of conserved quantities are also conserved, any function of



C


{\displaystyle C}
and the three other constants of the motion can be used as a fourth constant in place of



C


{\displaystyle C}
. This results in some confusion as to the form of Carter's constant. For example it is sometimes more convenient to use:




K
=
C
+
(

L

z


−
a
E

)

2




{\displaystyle K=C+(L_{z}-aE)^{2}}


in place of



C


{\displaystyle C}
. The quantity



K


{\displaystyle K}
is useful because it is always non-negative. In general any fourth conserved quantity for motion in the Kerr family of spacetimes may be referred to as "Carter's constant".
