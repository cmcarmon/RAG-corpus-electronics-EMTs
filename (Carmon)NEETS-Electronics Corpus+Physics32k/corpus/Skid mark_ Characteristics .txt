Skid marks are divided into "acceleration marks" created on acceleration, if the engine provides more power than the tire can transmit; "braking marks," if the brakes "lock up" and cause the tire to slide; or "yaw marks", if the tire slides sideways. Each skid mark has a characteristic appearance, and an experienced accident reconstructor or forensic engineer can often determine what the vehicle was doing by examining the marks left by the tire.
Contrary to popular belief, skid marks are not caused by pieces of rubber from the tire being deposited on the road because friction heats up the tire. Skid marks are actually bituminous oils in the asphalt that are heated because of the friction of breaking or accelerating and rise to the surface, leaving dark marks. This is why the marks fade. Within one hour, 3-4% of the mark has already faded.
Skid marks will vary depending on whether the car uses ABS or not. If not, there will be two lines. The darker marks on the outside are from the front wheels, while the back tires leave thinner marks. This is because the force exerted makes the wheels take on a conical shape. If the car uses ABS, the marks will be much fainter as less heat is produced by the release-stop mechanism of ABS. Scuff marks may be visible however with ABS.
