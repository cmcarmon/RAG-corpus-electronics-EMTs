variants. New versions of UNIX are thus proliferated, resulting
in a complex and convoluted history. The most inï¬‚uential two
versions, created in the mid-1980s, are AT&T System V and
4.xBSD (Berkeley UNIX) from the Computer Science Depart-
ment, University of California, Berkeley. Many familiar UNIX
features have their origins in academia. Berkeley UNIX was the
source of the TCP/IP implementation, sockets, and many
common UNIX utilities.
