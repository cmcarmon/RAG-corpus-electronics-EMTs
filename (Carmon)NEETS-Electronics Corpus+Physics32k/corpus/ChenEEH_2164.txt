The directions of T and the loop rotation—if it were free to
move—are both indicated in Figure 1.3. The direction of
rotation is determined from T using the right-hand rule:
With the thumb in the direction of T, the ﬁngers give the
sense of rotation. The loop will not experience a torque when
the unit normal vector ^nn is pointing in the direction of B.
