Summary
For about three decades, microelectronics technologies have been evolving, starting with primitive digital logic
functions  and  evolving  to  the  extraordinary  capabilities  available  in  present-day VLSI ASICs.  This  evolution
promises  to  continue  for  at  least  another  decade,  leading  to VLSI  ICs  containing  complex  systems  and  vast
memory on a single IC. ASIC technologies (including the EDA/CAD tools which guide design to a Ô¨Ånal IC)
deliver this complex technology to the systems designers, including those not associated with a company having
a  microfabrication  facility.  This  delivery  of  a  highly  complex  technology  to  the  average  electronic  systems
designer is the result of a steady migration of specialized skill to very powerful EDA/CAD tools which control
the complexity of the design process and the result of a need to provide a wide variety of electronics designers
with access to technologies which earlier had been available only within large, vertically integrated companies.
