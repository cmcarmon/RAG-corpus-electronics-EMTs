Permanent Magnet AC Motors
When compared to induction motors, permanent magnet motors have higher steady state torque for the same
size  and  better  efÔ¨Åciency.  They  carry  a  polyphase  winding  in  the  stator,  which  can  be  either  rectangular  or
sinusoidally  distributed.  The  rotor  has  a  steel  core,  with  permanent  magnets  mounted  on  it  or  inset.  These
magnets can be made from a variety of materials, such as rare earth, ceramic, etc.
