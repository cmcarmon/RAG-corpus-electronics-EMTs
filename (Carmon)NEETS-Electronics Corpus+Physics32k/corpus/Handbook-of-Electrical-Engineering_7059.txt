binary  string  11010011011100  is  parsed  into  1,10,100,11,0,111,00.  Then  instead  of  sending  the  bits  of  each
phrase, we send a pointer to its preﬁx and the value of the last bit. Thus, if we use three bits for the pointer,
we will represent this string by (000,1), (001,0), (010,0), (001,1), (000,0), (100,1), (101,0), etc. For this short
example, the algorithm has not compressed the string—it has in fact expanded it.
