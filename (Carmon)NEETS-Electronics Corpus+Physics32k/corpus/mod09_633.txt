As the capacitor begins accumulating a charge, the voltage developed across the resistor will begin 
to decrease. At the end of the first time constant, the voltage developed across the resistor will have 
decreased by a value equal to 63.2 percent of the applied voltage. Since 100 volts is applied, the voltage 
across the resistor after 1TC will be equal to 36.8 volts. After the second time constant, the voltage across 
the resistor will be down to 13.5 volts. At the end of the third time constant, eR will be 5 volts and at the
