An n-gauge diameter means that a ball of lead (density 11.34 g/cm3 or 0.4097 lb/in3) with that diameter has a mass equal to 1/n part of the mass of the international avoirdupois pound (approx. 454 grams), that is, that n such lead balls could be cast from a pound weight of lead. Therefore, an n-gauge shotgun or n-bore rifle has a bore diameter (in inches) of approximately

{\displaystyle d_{n}=2{\sqrt[{3}]{{\frac {3}{4\pi }}{\frac {1\mathrm {~lb} /n}{0.4097\mathrm {~lb/in^{3}} }}}}}

Explanation:
Divide 1 pound by n to find the mass of each one of the balls
Divide it by 0.4097 lb/in3 (density of lead) to find the volume of each ball
Multiply it by 3/4 and divide it by pi, then find its cube root, (rearranged from the volume of a sphere equation) to find the radius of each ball
Multiply it by 2 to change from radius to diameter
This simplifies to the following formula for the internal diameter of the barrel of an n-gauge shotgun:

The gauge of firearms is determined by. 1 pound / gauge = weight of lead sphere. Caliber of lead sphere is then measured. This is essential information for understanding gauges.
