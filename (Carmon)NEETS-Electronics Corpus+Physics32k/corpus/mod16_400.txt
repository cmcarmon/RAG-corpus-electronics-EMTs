in their use. The techniques suggested here are not all-inclusive. You will find, as you develop your
technical skills, other variations and techniques in use. Consider the techniques for measuring current in a
circuit. You can accomplish this by placing an ammeter in series with the circuit or by measuring the
voltage across a resistor of known value and using Ohmâ€™s law to figure current. This last technique has the
advantage of eliminating the necessity of opening the circuit to connect the ammeter.
