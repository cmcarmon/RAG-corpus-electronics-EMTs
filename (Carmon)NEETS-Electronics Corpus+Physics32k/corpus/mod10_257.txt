It depends on the polarization of the wave and the angle at which the wave strikes the reflecting surface. 
Radio waves that keep their phase relationships after reflection normally produce a stronger signal at the 
receiving site. Those that are received out of phase produce a weak or fading signal. The shifting in the 
phase relationships of reflected radio waves is one of the major reasons for fading. Fading will be 
discussed in more detail later in this chapter.
