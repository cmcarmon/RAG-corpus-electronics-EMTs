The  functional  level  abstracts  logical  elements  into  corresponding  computational  units,  such  as  registers,
multiplexers, and arithmetic logic units (ALUs). The architectural level abstracts functional information into
computational algorithms or paradigms. Examples of common computational paradigms are listed below:
