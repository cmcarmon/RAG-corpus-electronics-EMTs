Problem QP-2 is representative of a broader class of optimiza-
tion problems where the function that is minimized is a dis-
tance in the Euclidean space Rn. One typical problem that
arises in a variety of situations, for instance, is the linear least
squares problem. The objective of the linear least squares
problem is to ﬁnd x 2 Rn such that the Euclidean distance
between Dx 2 Rm and b 2 Rm is as small as possible. The
matrix D is an m  n matrix, and the system Dx ¼ b is typi-
cally inconsistent. The function being minimized in the linear
least squares problem is the following:
