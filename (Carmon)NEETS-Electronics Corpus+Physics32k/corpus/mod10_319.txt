Natural interference refers to the static that you often hear when listening to a radio. This 
interference is generated by natural phenomena, such as thunderstorms, snowstorms, cosmic sources, and 
the sun. The energy released by these sources is transmitted to the receiving site in roughly the same 
manner as radio waves. As a result, when ionospheric conditions are favorable for the long distance 
propagation of radio waves, they are likewise favorable for the propagation of natural interference. 
Natural interference is very erratic, particularly in the hf band, but generally will decrease as the operating 
frequency is increased and wider bandwidths are used. There is little natural interference above 30 
megahertz.
