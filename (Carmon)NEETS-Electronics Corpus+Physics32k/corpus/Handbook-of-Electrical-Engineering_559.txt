conduction  begins.  In  power-supply  applications,  where  input  voltages  are  quite  large,  these  gaps  are  of  no
concern. However, in many other applications, especially in instrumentation, the 0.7-V drop can be a signiﬁcant
portion  of  the  total  input  voltage  swing  and  can  seriously  affect  circuit  performance.  For  example,  most  ac
instruments rectify ac inputs so they can be measured by a device that responds to dc levels. It is obvious that
small ac signals could not be measured if it were always necessary for them to reach 0.7 V before rectiﬁcation
could begin. For these applications, precision rectiﬁers are necessary.
