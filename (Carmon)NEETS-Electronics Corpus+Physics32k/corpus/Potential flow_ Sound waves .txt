Small-amplitude sound waves can be approximated with the following potential-flow model:

{\displaystyle {\frac {\partial ^{2}\varphi }{\partial t^{2}}}={\overline {a}}^{2}\Delta \varphi ,}

which is a linear wave equation for the velocity potential φ. Again the oscillatory part of the velocity vector v is related to the velocity potential by v = ∇φ, while as before Δ is the Laplace operator, and ā is the average speed of sound in the homogeneous medium. Note that also the oscillatory parts of the pressure p and density ρ each individually satisfy the wave equation, in this approximation.
