. Phase-coded pulse compression: In the phase-coded
pulse compression, a long pulse with duration Tp is
divided into N subpulses, called chips, of width Tc . The
phase of each subpulse is chosen to be either 0 or p radian.
The output of the matched ﬁlter has a spike of width Tc
with an amplitude N times greater than that of the long
pulse. The pulse compression ratio is Tp=Tc ¼ N .
