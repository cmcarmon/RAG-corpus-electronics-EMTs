Distributed and Sequential Detection
The detection procedures discussed in the preceding paragraphs are based on the assumption that all measure-
ments can and should be used in the detection of the signal, and moreover that no constraints exist on how
measurements can be combined. There are a number of applications, however, in which constraints apply to
the information pattern of the measurements.
