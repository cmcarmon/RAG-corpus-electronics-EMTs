tpd,1→0 We define tpd,1→0 for a given input terminal and a given output termi-
nal of a combinational digital circuit as the signal propagation delay from
the input terminal to the output terminal for a high to low instantaneous
transition at the input. More precisely, tpd,1→0 for an input-output terminal
pair is the time interval from the moment that the input changes from a 1
to a 0 to the moment that the output reaches a corresponding valid output
voltage level (VOH or VOL).
