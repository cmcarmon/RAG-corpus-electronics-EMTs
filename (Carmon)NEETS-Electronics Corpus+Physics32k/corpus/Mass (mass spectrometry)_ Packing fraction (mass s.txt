The term packing fraction was defined by Aston as the difference of the measured mass M and the nearest integer mass I (based on the oxygen-16 mass scale) divided by the quantity comprising the mass number multiplied by ten thousand:




f

M

I

I





{\displaystyle f={\frac {M-I}{10^{4}\ I}}}
.
Aston's early model of nuclear structure (prior to the discovery of the neutron) postulated that the electromagnetic fields of closely packed protons and electrons in the nucleus would interfere and a fraction of the mass would be destroyed. A low packing fraction is indicative of a stable nucleus.
