The definitive mass measurement has been made by the BaBar experiment, which reported a mass of 2286.46 MeV/c2 with a small uncertainty. To put this in context, it is more than twice as heavy as a proton. The excess mass is easily explained by the large constituent mass of the charm quark, which by itself is more than that of the proton.
