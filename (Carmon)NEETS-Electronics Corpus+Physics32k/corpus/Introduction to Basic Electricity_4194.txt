The decimal system is called a base-10 system be-
cause it contains 10 digits, 0 through 9. The binary 
number system is a base-2 system because it con-
tains two digits, 0 and 1. The position of the 0 or 1 in 
a binary number indicates its value within the num-
ber. This is referred to as its place value or weight. The 
place value of the digits in a binary number increases 
by powers of two.
