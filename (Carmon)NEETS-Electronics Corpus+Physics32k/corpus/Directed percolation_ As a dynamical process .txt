Interpreting the preferred direction as a temporal degree of freedom, directed percolation can be regarded as a stochastic process that evolves in time. In the case of bond DP the time parameter



t


{\displaystyle t}
is discrete and all sites are updated in parallel. Activating a certain site (called initial seed) at time



t
=
0


{\displaystyle t=0}
the resulting cluster can be constructed row by row. The corresponding number of active sites



N
(
t
)


{\displaystyle N(t)}
varies as time evolves.
