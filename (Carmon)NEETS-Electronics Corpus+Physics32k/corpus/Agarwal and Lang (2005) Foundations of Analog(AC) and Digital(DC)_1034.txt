Since iB > 0 and vCE > 0.2 V, it immediately follows that the BJT operates in its active
region. In other words, the emitter diode in Figure 7.49c must be ON, and the collector
diode must be OFF (see the active region BJT model in Figure 7.50b). Since the emitter
diode is ON, it appears as a short circuit, and so
vBE = 0.6 V.
