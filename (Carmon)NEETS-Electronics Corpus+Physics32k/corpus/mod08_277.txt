 A-34. By neutralization such as the use of a capacitor to provide regenerative (positive) feedback.
 A-35. C2 and the secondary of T1.
 A-36. R1 provides the proper bias to the base of Q1 from VBB .
 A-37. R2 provides the proper bias to the emitter of Q1.
 A-38. The output would decrease. (C4 decouples R2 preventing degenerative feedback from R2.)
 A-39. C5 and the primary of T2.
 A-40. Four.
