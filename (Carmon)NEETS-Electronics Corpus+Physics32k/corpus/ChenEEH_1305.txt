Accelerated Graphics Port
Because of the large amount of 3-D image processing data, PCI
busses limit an animation to be life-like in realism and depth.
Accelerated graphics port (AGP) technology was invented to
accelerate graphics performance by providing a dedicated
high-speed port (independent to PCI) for transferring 3-D
texture data from system memory to video memory in a
graphics controller.
