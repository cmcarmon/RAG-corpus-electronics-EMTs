The output of the IF amplifiers is applied to the SECOND DETECTOR. It is then rectified and
passed through one or more stages of amplification in the video amplifier(s). The output stage of the
receiver is normally an emitter follower. The low-impedance output of the emitter follower matches the
impedance of the cable. The video pulses are coupled through the cable to the indicator for video display
on the crt.
