AC Analysis
Ac  analysis  uses  phasor  analysis  to  calculate  the  frequency  response  of  a  circuit.  The  analysis  is  useful  for
calculating  the  gain.  3  dB  frequency  input  and  output  impedance,  and  noise  of  a  circuit  as  a  function  of
frequency, bias conditions, temperature, etc.
