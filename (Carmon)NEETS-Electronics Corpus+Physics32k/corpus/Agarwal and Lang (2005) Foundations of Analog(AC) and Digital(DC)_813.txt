Its circuit symbol is shown in Figure 6.8. As shown in Figure 6.8, the control
terminal of the MOSFET is called its gate G, the input terminal its drain D, and
the output terminal its source S. For our purposes, we can treat the source and
drain in a symmetric fashion. The name assignment is related to the direction of
current flow. The terminals are labeled such that current flows from the drain
to the source.2 Equivalently, the channel terminal with the higher voltage is
labeled as the drain.
