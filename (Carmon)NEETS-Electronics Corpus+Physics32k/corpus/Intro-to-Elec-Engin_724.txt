The operating point Q is the intersection of the load line with the transfer characteristic, from
which IDQ and VGSQ can be read. While no systematic bias-point design procedure to serve all
applications exists, a simple procedure that will serve a good number of problems is outlined
here. In establishing the operating point Q, compromising between high stability and high gain,
one may choose
