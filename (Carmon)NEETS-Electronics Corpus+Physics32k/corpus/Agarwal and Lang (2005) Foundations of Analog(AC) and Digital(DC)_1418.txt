tpd,0→1 Similarly, we define tpd,0→1 for a given input terminal and a given output
terminal of a combinational circuit as the signal propagation delay through
input-output terminal pair for a low to high instantaneous transition at the
input. More precisely, tpd,0→1 for an input-output terminal pair is the time
interval from the moment that the input changes from a 0 to a 1 to the
moment that the output reaches a corresponding valid output voltage level.
