Knowledge Representation
After acquiring the knowledge, the next step is to represent the knowledge. In a rule-based expert system, the
IF-THEN (condition-action) rules are used. Rules are typically used to represent knowledge if the preexisting
knowledge can best be naturally represented as rules, if the knowledge is procedural, if the knowledge is mostly
context-independent, and if the knowledge is mostly categorical (“yes-no” type of answers). Frames, scripts,
and semantic networks are used as knowledge representation schemes for more descriptive, declarative knowl-
edge. In selecting an appropriate knowledge representation scheme, try to use the representation method which
most closely resembles the way the expert is thinking and expressing his/her knowledge.
