At this node, guess which directions the three wires’ currents take, labeling the three cur-
rents as I1, I2, and I3, respectively. Bear in mind that these directions of current are specula-
tive at this point. Fortunately, if it turns out that any of our guesses were wrong, we will know
when we mathematically solve for the currents (any “wrong” current directions will show up
as negative numbers in our solution).
