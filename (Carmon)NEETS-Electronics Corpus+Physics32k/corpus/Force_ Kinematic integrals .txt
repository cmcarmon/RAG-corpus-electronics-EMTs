Forces can be used to define a number of physical concepts by integrating with respect to kinematic variables. For example, integrating with respect to time gives the definition of impulse:







I

=

∫


t

1





t

2








F
→




d

t

,


{\displaystyle {\vec {I}}=\int _{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}{{\vec {F}}\mathrm {d} t},}

which by Newton's Second Law must be equivalent to the change in momentum (yielding the Impulse momentum theorem).
Similarly, integrating with respect to position gives a definition for the work done by a force:




W
=

∫

d




x
→





,


{\displaystyle W=\int _{{\vec {x}}_{1}}^{{\vec {x}}_{2}}{{\vec {F}}\cdot {\mathrm {d} {\vec {x}}}},}

which is equivalent to changes in kinetic energy (yielding the work energy theorem).
Power P is the rate of change dW/dt of the work W, as the trajectory is extended by a position change

{\displaystyle \scriptstyle {d}{\vec {x}}}
