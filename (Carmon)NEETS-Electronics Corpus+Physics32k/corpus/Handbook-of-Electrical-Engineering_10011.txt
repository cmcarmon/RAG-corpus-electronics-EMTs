Closed-Loop Frequency Response
When the closed-loop system of Fig. 100.42 has a sinusoidal input r(t) = R sin(wt + q), it is possible to evaluate
the closed-loop frequency response using the DF. If the feedback loop has no limit cycle when r(t) = 0 and, in
addition,  the  sinusoidal  input  r(t)  does  not  induce  a  limit  cycle,  then,  provided  that  Gc(s)G1(s)  gives  good
Ô¨Åltering,  x(t),  the  nonlinearity  input,  almost  equals  the  sinusoid  a  sin  wt.  Balancing  the  components  of
frequency w around the loop,
