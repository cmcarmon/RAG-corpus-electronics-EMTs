In the International System of Quantities, the level of a quantity is the logarithm of the ratio of the value of that quantity to a reference value of the same quantity. Examples are the various types of sound level: sound power level (literally, the level of the sound power, abbreviated SWL), sound exposure level (SEL), sound pressure level (SPL) and particle velocity level (SVL).
