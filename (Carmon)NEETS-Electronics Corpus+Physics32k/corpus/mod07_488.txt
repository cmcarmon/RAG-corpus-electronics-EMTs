Aside from the voltage divider effect, the inductor improves filtering in another way. You should 
recall that an inductor resists changes in the magnitude of the current flowing through it. Consequently, 
when the inductor is placed in series with the load, the inductor maintains steady current. In turn, this 
helps the voltage across the load remain constant when size of components is a factor.
