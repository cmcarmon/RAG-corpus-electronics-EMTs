In some countries during the last couple of decades, to
encourage more entrepreneurial building of generation plants,
governments started to allow independent power producers
(IPPs) to build generating plants that could be connected to
the grid. Rules were set up to require the monopoly power
companies to buy this generation from the IPPs at certain
rates. These IPPs are shown in separate boxes in Figure 1.1.
