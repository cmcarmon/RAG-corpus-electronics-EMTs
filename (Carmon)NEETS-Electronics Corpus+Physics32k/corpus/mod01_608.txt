The basic technique used for solving dc combination-circuit problems is the use of equivalent
circuits. To simplify a complex circuit to a simple circuit containing only one load, equivalent circuits are
substituted (on paper) for the complex circuit they represent. To demonstrate the method used to solve
combination circuit problems, the network shown in figure 3-54(A) will be used to calculate various
circuit quantities, such as resistance, current, voltage, and power.
