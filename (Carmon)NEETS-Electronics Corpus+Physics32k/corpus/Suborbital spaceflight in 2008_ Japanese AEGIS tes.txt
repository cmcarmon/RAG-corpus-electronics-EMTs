The Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force conducted a test of the AEGIS missile defence system, in conjunction with the US Navy and MDA. At 02:21 on 20 November, a target missile was launched from the Pacific Missile Range Facility at Barking Sands, by the US Navy. Three minutes later, an SM-3 interceptor was launched from the JDS Ch≈çkai. The SM-3 failed to intercept the target due to an infrared sensor fault. It was the second consecutive failure of an AEGIS test, following a similar malfunction during the US Navy test on 1 November.
