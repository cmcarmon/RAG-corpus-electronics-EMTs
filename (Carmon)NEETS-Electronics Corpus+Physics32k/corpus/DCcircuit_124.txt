Free electrons tend to move through conductors with some degree of friction, or opposition
to motion. This opposition to motion is more properly called resistance. The amount of current
in a circuit depends on the amount of voltage available to motivate the electrons, and also the
amount of resistance in the circuit to oppose electron ﬂow. Just like voltage, resistance is a
quantity relative between two points. For this reason, the quantities of voltage and resistance
are often stated as being ”between” or ”across” two points in a circuit.
