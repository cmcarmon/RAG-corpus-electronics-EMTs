You can create loads of other complex functions 
by combining multiple AND, OR, and NOT gates. 
Itâ€™s all a matter of which gates you use and how 
you interconnect them. Think about forming 
words from letters. With just 26 different 
choices, you can create millions of words. 
Likewise, you can create circuits that perform 
math functions (such as adders, multipliers, 
and many others) by connecting a whole 
bunch of gates in the right combination.
