The SPICE circuit simulation computer program uses scientiﬁc notation to display its output
information, and can interpret both scientiﬁc notation and metric preﬁxes in the circuit de-
scription ﬁles. If you are going to be able to successfully interpret the SPICE analyses through-
out this book, you must be able to understand the notation used to express variables of voltage,
current, etc. in the program.
