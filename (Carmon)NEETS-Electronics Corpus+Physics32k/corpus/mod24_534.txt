Insertion loss of both multimode and single mode interconnection devices is measured using
EIA/TIA-455-34. For Navy applications, an overfill launch condition is used at the input fiber. For other
applications a mandrel wrap may be used to strip out high-order mode power. The length of fiber before
the connection and after the connection may be specified for some applications. Power measurements are
made on an optical fiber or fiber optic cable before the joint is inserted and after the joint is made. Figure
5-12 illustrates the mandrel wrap method of measuring the insertion loss of an interconnecting device in
EIA/TIA-455-34.
