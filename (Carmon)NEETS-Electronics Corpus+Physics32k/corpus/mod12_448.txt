OPERATION ABOVE RESONANCE.â€”A phase shift occurs when an input frequency higher
than the center frequency is applied to the discriminator circuit and the current and voltage phase
relationships change. When a series-tuned circuit operates at a frequency above resonance, the inductive
reactance of the coil increases and the capacitive reactance of the capacitor decreases. Above resonance
the tank circuit acts like an inductor. Secondary current lags the primary tank voltage, ep. Notice that
secondary voltages e
