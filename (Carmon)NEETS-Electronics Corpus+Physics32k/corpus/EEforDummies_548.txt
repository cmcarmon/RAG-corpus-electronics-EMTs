Diodes are cylindrical, like resistors, but aren’t quite as colorful as resistors. 
Most diodes sport a stripe or other mark at one end, signifying the cathode 
(refer to Figure 9­1). In the circuit symbols shown in Figure 9­4, the anode 
is on the left (broad end of the arrowhead) and the cathode is on the right.
