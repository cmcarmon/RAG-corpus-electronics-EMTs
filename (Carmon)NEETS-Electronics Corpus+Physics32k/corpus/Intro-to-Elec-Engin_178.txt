Looking at Examples 2.2.1 and 2.2.3, it can be seen that there is no speciÔ¨Åc advantage
for either method since the number of equations needed for the solution is three in either case.
Such may not be the case in a number of other problems, in which case one should choose
judiciously the more convenient method, usually with the lower number of equations to be
solved.
