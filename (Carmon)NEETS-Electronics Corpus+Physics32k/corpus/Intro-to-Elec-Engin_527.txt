Note that ﬂip-ﬂops have propagation delay, which means that there is a small delay (about 20
ns) between the change instruction and the time Q actually changes. The value of D that matters
is its value when the change instruction is received, not its value at the later time when Q changes.
A convenient means of describing the series of transitions that occur as the signals set to the
ﬂip-ﬂop input change is the timing diagram. A timing diagram depicts inputs and outputs (as a
function of time) of the ﬂip-ﬂop (or any other logic device) showing the transitions that occur
over time. The timing diagram thus provides a convenient visual representation of the evolution
of the state of the ﬂip-ﬂop. However, the transitions can also be represented in tabular form.
