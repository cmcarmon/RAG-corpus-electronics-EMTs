Figure 60.19 shows the emission spectrum for several temperatures, overlaid by the cut-off energies for silicon
and GaSb. For an emitter temperature of 1700K, the silicon device is able to use only about 5% of the available
ﬂux,  while  the  device  with  a  bandgap  at  about  0.7  eV  can  use  30%. When  corrected  for  obscuration  of  the
front contact grid, this portion of the available spectrum that the cell can use is called the spectral utilization
factor. A silicon photovoltaic cell can achieve efﬁciencies of about 25% under illumination by the solar spectrum.
The  major  losses  are  in  relaxation  of  carriers  generated  by  high-energy  photons  back  to  the  bandgap  and
nonabsorbing  sub-bandgap  energies.  The  photovoltaic  cell  in  a  TPV  system  can  be  quite  efﬁcient  —  40  to
50% — in converting the usable energy into electricity, since most of this energy arrives at close to the bandgap
energy for a selective radiator. For this reason, the silicon device will be more efﬁcient than the 0.7 eV device.
