As can be seen from the thrust equation, the effective speed of the exhaust controls the amount of thrust produced from a particular quantity of fuel burnt per second.
An equivalent measure, the net impulse per weight unit of propellant expelled, is called specific Impulse,




I

s
p




{\displaystyle I_{sp}}
, and this is one of the most important figures that describes a rocket's performance. It is defined such that it is related to the effective exhaust velocity by:





v

g

{\displaystyle v_{e}=I_{sp}\cdot g_{0}}

where:





I

s
p




{\displaystyle I_{sp}}
has units of seconds





g

0




{\displaystyle g_{0}}
is the acceleration at the surface of the Earth
Thus, the greater the specific impulse, the greater the net thrust and performance of the engine.




I

{\displaystyle I_{sp}}
is determined by measurement while testing the engine. In practice the effective exhaust velocities of rockets varies but can be extremely high, ~4500 m/s, about 15 times the sea level speed of sound in air.
