small, so integrated circuits (which I discuss 
in Chapter 11) use thousands of transistors to 
switch signals around on a single tiny chip. 
Mechanical  switches  and  relays  have  their 
uses,  too,  in  situations  where  transistors 
just  can’t  handle  the  load,  such  as  switch-
ing currents bigger than about 5 A or switch-
ing  higher  voltages  (as  in  electrical  power  
systems).
