With the output voltage equal to 1 millivolt, and if fading is to be avoided, the output voltage must
remain at 1 millivolt. However, if a reflected signal is received that is approximately one-half the strength
(5 microvolts) of the original and is in phase with the original signal, the total input signal to the receiving
