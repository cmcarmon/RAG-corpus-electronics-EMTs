The original work in recursive stochastic approximation
algorithms was introduced by Robbins and Monro (1951),
who developed and analyzed a recursive procedure for ﬁnding
the root of a real-valued function g(w) of a real variable w. The
function is not known, but noise-corrupted observations could
be taken at values of w selected by the experimenter.
A function g (w) with the form g(w) ¼ Ex[f (w)] (Ex[] is the
expectation operator) is called a regression function of f (w)
and, conversely, f (w) is called a sample function of g(w). The
following conditions are needed to obtain the Robbins-Monro
algorithm (Robbins and Monro, 1951):
