Figure 3-2 depicts the evolution of a program. Programming can be complicated, and advance 
preparation is required before you can actually start to write or code the program. The first two steps, 
problem understanding/definition and flowcharting, fall into the advance planning phase of programming. 
It is important at this point to develop correct habits and procedures, since this will prevent later 
difficulties in program preparation.
