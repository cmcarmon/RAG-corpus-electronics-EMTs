Admission Control
Admission control is a proactive form of congestion control
(as opposed to reactive congestion control used in protocols
like TCP) that ensures that demand for network resources
never exceeds the supply. Preventing congestions from occur-
ring reduces packet delay and loss, which improves real-time
performance.
