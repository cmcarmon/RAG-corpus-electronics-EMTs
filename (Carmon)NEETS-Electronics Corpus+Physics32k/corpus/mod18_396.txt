The phase detector produces a video signal. The amplitude of the video signal is determined by the
phase difference between the coho reference signal and the IF echo signals. This phase difference is the
same as that between the actual transmitted pulse and its echo. The resultant video signal may be either
positive or negative. This video output, called coherent video, is applied to the 14-megahertz cw carrier
oscillator.
