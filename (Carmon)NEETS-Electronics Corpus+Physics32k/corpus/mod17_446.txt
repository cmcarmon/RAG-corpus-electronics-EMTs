of a desired signal intermodulates with the carrier of an undesired signal. Extremely strong, off-frequency 
signals may even burn out the sensitive front-end stages of a receiver. Emi also can degrade overall 
receiver performance in a less noticeable way. It does this by desensitizing the receiver front end. The 
noise level is raised and effectively lowers the signal to noise ratio and thus the sensitivity. This causes a 
decrease in desired signal amplification. For these reasons, shipboard receive systems are designed to 
include protective circuitry between the antenna and receiver to filter out off-frequency signals. This 
prevents or limits interference, desensitization, or burnout. Depending upon the system, these protective 
devices may include filters, multicouplers, preselectors, and so forth. These devices can minimize 
interference caused by inadequate frequency separation or poor physical isolation between transmit and 
receive antennas.
