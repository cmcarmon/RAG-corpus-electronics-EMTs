Over  the  years,  EEG  analyses  have  been  conducted  primarily  in  clinical  settings,  to  detect  gross  organic
pathologies and the epilepsies, and in research facilities to quantify the central effect of new pharmacological
agents. As a result of these efforts, cortical EEG patterns have been shown to be modiÔ¨Åed by a wide variety of
variables including biochemical, metabolic, circulatory, hormonal, neuroelectric, and behavioral factors. In the
past, interpretation of the EEG was limited to visual inspection by a trained electroencephalographer capable
of distinguishing normal activity from localized or generalized abnormalities of particular types from relatively
long EEG records. This approach has left clinicians and researchers alike lost in a sea of EEG paper records.
Computer technology has permitted the application of a host of methods to quantify EEG changes. With this
in mind, this section provides an introduction to some of the basic concepts underlying the generation of the
EEG, a review of the basic approaches used in quantifying alterations in the EEG, and some insights regarding
quantitative electrophysiology techniques.
