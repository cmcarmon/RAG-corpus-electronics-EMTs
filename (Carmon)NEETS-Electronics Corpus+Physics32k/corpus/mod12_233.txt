The PLATE MODULATOR is a high-level modulator. The modulator tube must be capable of 
varying the plate-supply voltage of the final power amplifier. It must vary the plate voltage so that the 
plate current pulses will vary between 0 and nearly twice their unmodulated value to achieve 100-percent 
modulation.
