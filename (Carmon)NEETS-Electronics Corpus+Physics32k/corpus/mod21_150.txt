You normally test high-power amplifier tubes, which operate in the low-to-high frequency range, in
the transmitter in which they are to be used. When you operate the tube in a transmitter, its condition can
be determined by using built-in meters to measure the grid current, plate current, and power output and
comparing those values with those obtained when using tubes known to be good.
