Another use for wireless switches is in log homes, where electrical installations can be difficult because of the amount of routing and drilling that would otherwise be needed. When running a regular (non-wireless) circuit, the electrician must drill a hole through all of the logs to get each wire to the switch location. The electrician also must cut a large hole in the log to install a switch box. Wireless switches do not need switch boxes because there are no wires and no routing is needed. This decreases the electrical work required.
