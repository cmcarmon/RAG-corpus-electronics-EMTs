Devices that adhere to this discipline will be able to communicate with
each other and be immune to noise levels that fall within the noise margins.
When NM1 and NM0 are equal, we say that the noise margins are symmetric.
Relating the threshold voltage parameters to the numbers used in our
example, VOH corresponds to 4.5 V, VOL corresponds to 0.5 V, VIH corre-
sponds to 3 V, and VIL corresponds to 2 V. This mapping is illustrated in
Figure 5.10. For our example, the noise margin for a logical 0, NM0, is 1.5 V
(2 V − 0.5 V), which is the difference between VIL, the maximum input voltage
recognized by a receiver as a logic 0, and VOL, the highest legal output voltage
for a logic 0. Similarly, the noise margin for a 1, NM1, is also 1.5 V (4.5 V −
3 V), which is the difference between VOH, the minimum legal output voltage
for a logic 1, and VIH, the minimum input voltage recognized by a receiver as
a logic 1.
