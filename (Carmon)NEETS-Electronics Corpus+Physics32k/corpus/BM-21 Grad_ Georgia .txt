RS-122 Magaria: In March 2012, the Republic of Georgia unveiled its own heavily modified self-propelled version of the BM-21 Grad. There are innovative improvements similar to that of its Polish counterpart. The crew cabin is armoured and well protected in accordance to STANAG level 2 or higher. The 40 tube launcher is fitted with a pin point target system and has a maximum firing distance of 45 km depending on ammunition, that guarantees much more precision at greater distances. There is enough room for an additional 40 tube pack. The launcher can be deployed and activated directly from inside the crew cab, so that the time between salvos is heavily decreased. However the traditional external setup is also available. An entire barrage is fired in less than 20 seconds. The general purpose platform can also be used for more sophisticated rocket systems.
