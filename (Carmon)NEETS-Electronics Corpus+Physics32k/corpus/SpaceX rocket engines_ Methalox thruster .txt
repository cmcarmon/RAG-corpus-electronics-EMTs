In his announcement of the Interplanetary Transport System (ITS) at the 67th International Astronautical Congress on 27 September 2016, Elon Musk indicated that all of the reaction control system thrusters for the ITS vehicles—ITS booster, Interplanetary Spaceship, and ITS tanker—will operate from the gaseous methane and oxygen supply in each of those vehicles. New thrusters will be developed for the purpose.
