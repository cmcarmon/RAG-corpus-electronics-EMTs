There are several sources of information dealing with the theory and practice of wave propagation in space.
Some of these are in the reference section. Journals such as Radio Science, IEE Proceedings Part H, and IEEE
Transactions on Antennas and Propagation are devoted to EM wave propagation. Radio Science is available from
the American  Geophysical  Union,  2000  Florida Avenue  NW, Washington  DC  20009; IEE  Proceedings  Part  H
from IEE Publishing Department, Michael Faraday House, 6 Hills Way, Stevenage, Herts, SG1 2AY, U.K.; and
IEEE  Transactions  on  Antennas  and  Propagation  from  IEEE,  445 Hoes  Lane,  P.O.  Box  1331,  Piscataway,  NJ
