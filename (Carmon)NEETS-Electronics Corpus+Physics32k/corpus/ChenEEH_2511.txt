spiral inductors easily produce inductance values higher than
1 nH and are frequently used in MMIC design, either in the
form of squared or circular topologies. Meander-line inductors
may also be considered as a special class of spiral inductors, but
they generate lower inductance values. The difÔ¨Åculty of the
spiral layout is the electrical crossover from the center turn
back to the outside circuit. This may be achieved by means of
an air bridge or dielectrically spaced underpasses. If a silicon
substrate is used, the resulting Q-factor is low, which is a major
design concern for application at higher frequencies.
