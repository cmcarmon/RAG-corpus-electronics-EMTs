depth. The sound speed not only varies with depth but also varies in different regions of the ocean and with
time as well. In deep water, the SVP ﬂuctuates the most in the upper ocean due to variations of temperature
and  weather.  Just  below  the  sea  surface  is  the  surface  layer  where  the  sound  speed  is  greatly  affected  by
temperature and wind action. Below this layer lies the seasonal thermocline where the temperature and speed
decrease with depth, and the variations are seasonal. In the next layer, the main thermocline, the temperature
and  speed  decrease  with  depth  and  surface  conditions  or  seasons  have  little  effect.  Finally,  there  is  the  deep
isothermal  layer  where  the  temperature  is  nearly  constant  at  39(cid:176)F,  and  the  sound  velocity  increases  almost
linearly with depth. A typical deep water sound velocity proﬁle as a function of depth is shown in Fig. 19.9.
