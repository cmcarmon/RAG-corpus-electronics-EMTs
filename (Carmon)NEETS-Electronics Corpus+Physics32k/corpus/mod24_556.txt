optical power backscattered due to Rayleigh scattering. The amount of backscattered optical power at
each point depends on the forward optical power and its backscatter capture coefficient. The backscatter
capture coefficient varies with length depending on fiber properties. Fiber properties that may affect the
backscatter coefficient include the refractive index profile, numerical aperture (multimode), and
mode-field diameter (single mode) at the particular measurement point. The source wavelength and pulse
width may also affect the amount of backscattered power.
