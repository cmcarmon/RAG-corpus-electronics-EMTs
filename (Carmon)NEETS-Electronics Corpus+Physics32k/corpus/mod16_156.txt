Once the most accessible test point is found, an ohmmeter is usually used to take the resistance
measurement. Because of the degree of accuracy needed when an ohmmeter is used, proper calibration
and understanding of the meter scales is a must. (Topic 2 of this module will discuss these requirements
in detail.) When using an ohmmeter, you must observe the following precautions:
