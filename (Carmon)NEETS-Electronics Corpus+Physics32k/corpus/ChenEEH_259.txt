Most of today’s VRMs draw power from the 5-V output of the
silver box. This bus voltage is too low for future low-voltage,
high-current processors’ applications. A distributed power
system (DPS) with a high bus voltage can be the solution for
future computer systems, such as servers’ and workstations’
power systems. In a high-voltage bus-distributed system, the
bus conduction loss is lower and the distribution bus is easy to
