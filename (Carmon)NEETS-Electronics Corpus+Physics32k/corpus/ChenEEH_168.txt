Another well-known types of polynomial ﬁlters include the
Chebychev ﬁlters; they use special polynomials discovered by
Russian scientist Chebychev. They are also described by the
general Formula 4.30, but the requirements are different. In
the passband, the amplitude response oscillates between two
limits, like in Figure 4.18. The ripple is normally expressed in
decibels. At v ¼ 1, the response always drops by the amount of
speciﬁed ripple, as in the ﬁgure. Compared with the maximally
ﬂat ﬁlters, Chebychev ﬁlters have better attenuation outside
the passband and approximate a constant better in the fre-
quency band from 0 to 1. Table 4.1 gives pole positions of
Chebychev ﬁlters with 0.5 dB ripple.
