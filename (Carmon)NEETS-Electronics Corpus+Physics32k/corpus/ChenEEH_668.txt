6. Static or dynamic: For R/W memories, the data can
remain valid as long as Vdd is on (static cell
in
SRAM), or the data should be refreshed every 1.2 ms
(dynamic cell in DRAM). In the dynamic class, high-
throughput Synchronous DRAMs (SDRAM) are also
available. Circuit level issues are discussed in overview
articles concerning SRAMs, such as in Evans (1995),
and for DRAMs, such as in Itoh (1997) and Prince
(1994).
