INDUCTANCE BRIDGE.â€”The value of the unknown inductance Lx may be determined by means
of the simple bridge circuit shown in figure 1-8. Ratio arms R1 and R2 are accurately calibrated resistors.
Ls is a standard inductor with a known inductance; Rs is the known resistance, and Rx represents the
resistance of the unknown inductor.
