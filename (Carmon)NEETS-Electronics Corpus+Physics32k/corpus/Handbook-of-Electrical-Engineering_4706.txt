In  electrical  engineering,  the  term 
  usually  refers  to  the  study  and  use  of  waves  of  mechanical
vibrations  propagating  in  solids  or  liquids  with  frequencies  in  the  megahertz  or  low  gigahertz  ranges.  Such
waves  in  these  frequency  ranges  have  wavelengths  on  the  order  of  micrometers  and  thus  can  be  electrically
generated,  directed,  and  detected  with  transducers  of  reasonable  size.  These  ultrasonic  devices  are  used  for
signal  processing  directly  in  such  applications  as  ﬁltering  and  pulse  compression  and  indirectly  in  acousto-
optic  processors;  for  ﬂaw  detection  in  optically  opaque  materials;  for  resonant  circuits  in  frequency  control
applications; and for medical imaging of human organs, tissue, and blood ﬂow.
