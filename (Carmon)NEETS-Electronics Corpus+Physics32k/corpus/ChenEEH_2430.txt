6.5.1 Intercepted Power and Radar Cross Section
First consider a u-polarized incident ﬁeld (eif ¼ 0). With this
condition, the power–density, Pu
ds, of the scattered ﬁeld at a
given location (r, u, f) can be expressed using the resulting
scattered E-ﬁeld (from equations 6.124 and 6.125). For brevity
of presentation, the angle of incidence (ui, fi) and the obser-
vation point (r, u, f) can be considered as implicit variables,
as appropriate:
