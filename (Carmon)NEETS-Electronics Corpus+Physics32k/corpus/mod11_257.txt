The Schottky barrier diode is sometimes called the HOT-ELECTRON or HOT-CARRIER DIODE 
because the electrons flowing from the semiconductor to the metal have a higher energy level than the 
electrons in the metal. The effect is the same as it would be if the metal were heated to a higher 
temperature than normal. Figure 2-52 is an illustration of the construction of a Schottky barrier diode.
