a family of microcontrollers made by Microchip 
Technology that use reduced  instruction  set 
computer (risC). RISC is based on the strategy 
that fewer basic instructions allow for higher perfor-
mance. Basing microcontrollers on this architecture is 
a strategy that was derived from the original PIC1640 
microcontroller.
