Detection mechanisms have to ﬁnd out whether the actual state
of the system is erroneous. To this end, the original system is
supplemented by additional components that perform checks.
Ideal checks are based solely on the speciﬁcation and check
the complete behavior of the system independently from the
checked system to avoid the effects of errors to the checks
(Lee and Anderson, 1990). The complexity of the system and
the need of accessing the information to be checked usually
prevents the implementation of an ideal checker. Less strict
checks do not guarantee the absence of errors, but the results
can still be accepted with a high probability.
