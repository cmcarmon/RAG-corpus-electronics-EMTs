Important switching waveforms of the MOSFET are indi-
cated in Figure 7.13 for an inductive load, similar to the one in
Figure 7.7. The gate pulse makes transitions between VGP and
VGN through the gate resistor, RG. Initially, the device is off.
When the gate pulse is turned on high, the capacitor CGD and
CGS charge exponentially toward VGP
through RG. The
MOSFET turns on when the gate-source voltage crosses VTH .
The device goes from cut-off to saturation region. As the gate
voltage rises, the MOSFET current also increases, as deter-
mined by equation 7.14, until it is conducting IO. The drain
voltage remains at VD as long as the free-wheeling diode is
conducting. Once the MOSFET attains the current IO, the
drain current is clamped. Since the device is conducting in
saturation, the gate-source voltage is also clamped. The cap-
acitor CGD now starts discharging through the gate resistor.
The gate current is given as:
