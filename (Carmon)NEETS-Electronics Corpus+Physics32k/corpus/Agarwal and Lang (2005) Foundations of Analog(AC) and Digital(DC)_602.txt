The graphical method described here is really more general than it might
at first appear. For circuits containing many resistors and sources, but only one
nonlinear element, the rest of the circuit, exclusive of the one nonlinear element,
is by definition linear. Hence, as described previously in Example 4.4, regardless
of circuit complexity we can reduce the circuit to the form in Figure 4.16 by
