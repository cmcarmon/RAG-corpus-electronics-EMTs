In many practical applications a circuit may contain more than one source of emf. Sources of emf
that cause current to flow in the same direction are considered to be SERIES AIDING and the voltages
are added. Sources of emf that would tend to force current in opposite directions are said to be SERIES
OPPOSING, and the effective source voltage is the difference between the opposing voltages. When two
opposing sources are inserted into a circuit current flow would be in a direction determined by the larger
source. Examples of series aiding and opposing sources are shown in figure 3-26.
