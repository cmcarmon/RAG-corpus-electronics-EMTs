The largest single market for DRAMs is with microprocessors in personal computers. Rapid microprocessor
performance improvements have led DRAM manufacturers to offer improvements especially designed for the
“PC” environment. Extended Data Out mode (EDO) keeps the data accessed from a DRAM valid over a longer
period of the DRAM cycle. EDO mode is intended to ease the synchronization problem between a DRAM and
the  increasingly  higher  speed  microprocessor.  Synchronous  DRAM  (SDRAM)  allows  the  rapid  sequential
