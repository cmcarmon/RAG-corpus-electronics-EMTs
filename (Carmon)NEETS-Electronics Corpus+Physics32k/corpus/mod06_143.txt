As with all inventions, Fleming’s diode was immediately the subject of much experimentation and
many attempts at improvement. An American experimenter, Dr. Lee De Forest, added another active
element to the diode in 1906. He was trying to improve the radio application of Fleming’s diode. His new
tube was eventually called a triode.
