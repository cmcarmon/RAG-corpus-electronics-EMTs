The 
families  are  CMOS 
(complementary  metal  oxide  semiconductor)  and 
TTL  (transistor  transistor  logic).  Each  of  these 
families is then further sub-divided. Representative 
circuits  for  a 
in  both 
technologies are shown in Figs 10.29 and 10.30. 
  The most common family of TTL logic devices 
is known as the 74-series. Devices from this family 
are  coded  with  the  prefix  number  74.  Variants 
within  the  family  are  identified  by  letters  which 
follow the initial 74 prefix, as shown in Table 10.6. 
  The  most  common  family  of  CMOS  devices  is 
known  as  the  4000-series.  Variants  within  the 
family  are  identified  by  the  suffix  letters  given  in 
Table 10.7.
