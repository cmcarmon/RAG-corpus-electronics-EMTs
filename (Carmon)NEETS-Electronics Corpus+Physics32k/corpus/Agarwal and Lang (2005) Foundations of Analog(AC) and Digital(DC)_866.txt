However, when the input vIN is high (and above the threshold VT), the
MOSFET is on and displays a resistance RON between its D and S terminals,
thereby pulling the output voltage lower. However, the output voltage is not
0 V as predicted by the simpler S model of the MOSFET. Instead, the value of
the output voltage is given by the voltage-divider relationship:
