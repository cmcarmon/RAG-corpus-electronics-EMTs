The crystal-controlled Armstrong oscillator (figure 2-22) uses the series-tuned mode of operation. It 
works much the same as the Hartley oscillator except that frequency stability is improved by the crystal 
(in the feedback path). To operate the oscillator at different frequencies, you simply change crystals (each 
crystal operates at a different frequency).
