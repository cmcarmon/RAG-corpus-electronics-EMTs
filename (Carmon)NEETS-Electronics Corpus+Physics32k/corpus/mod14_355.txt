Line 4 of the Truth Table shows both PS and CLR HIGH, a negative-going CLK, and J and K at 0,
or LOW. This corresponds to T3 on the timing diagram. In this condition the FF holds the previous
condition of the output. In this case the FF is reset. If the circuit were set when these inputs occurred, it
would remain set.
