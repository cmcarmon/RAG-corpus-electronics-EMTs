When simple antennas are used, the transmission line, which is usually vertical, is less affected by a 
horizontally mounted antenna. When the antenna is mounted at right angles to the transmission line and 
horizontal polarization is used, the line is kept out of the direct field of the antenna. As a result, the 
radiation pattern and electrical characteristics of the antenna are practically unaffected by the presence of 
the vertical transmission line.
