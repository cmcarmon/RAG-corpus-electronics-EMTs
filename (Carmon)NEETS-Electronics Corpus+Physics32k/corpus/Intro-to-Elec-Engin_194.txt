This text does not teach MATLAB; it assumes that the student is familiar with it through previous
work. Also, the book does not depend on a student having MATLAB. MATLAB, however,
provides an enhancement to the learning experience if it is available. If it is not, the problems
involving MATLAB can simply be skipped, and the remainder of the text still makes sense.
If one wants to get a quick introduction, the book entitled Getting Started with MATLAB 5 by
R. Pratap, listed under Selected Bibliography for Supplemental Reading for Computer-Aided
Circuit Analysis, may be a good source.
