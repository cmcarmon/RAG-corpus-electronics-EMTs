Next, consider the case where there is an external source producing a temporally-constant
amount of flux. Clearly we would like to be able to define a fixed voltage across the terminals
of our element even when the element moves. However, since a moving element would create
the same effect as a time-varying flux
a situation we have disallowed, the external flux must
also be 0.
