It’s constantly proportional!
The relationship between voltage (V  ) and current (I  ) in a component with 
resistance (R) was discovered in the early 1800s by Georg Ohm (does his 
name sound familiar?). He figured out that for components with a fixed resis-
tance, voltage and current vary in the same way: Double the voltage, and the 
current is doubled; halve the voltage, and the current is halved. He summed 
up this relationship quite nicely in the simple mathematical equation that 
bears his name: Ohm’s Law.
