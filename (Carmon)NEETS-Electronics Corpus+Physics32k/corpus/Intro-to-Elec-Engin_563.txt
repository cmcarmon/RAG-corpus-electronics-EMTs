Writing is the same as storing data into memory and reading is the same as retrieving the data later.
RAM is said to be volatile because its contents are retained only as long as power is present. A
RAM device is a collection of 2n addressable storage locations, each of which contains k bits. Its
block diagram is shown in Figure 6.2.16, in which each cell may be a ﬂip-ﬂop or a capacitor, and
n address lines are decoded to select k cells. A static RAM, in which each cell is a ﬂip-ﬂop, is the
read-and-write memory that retains its data so long as the power is applied, without any further
action needed from the computer. Static RAM is used in microprocessor-based systems requiring
small memory. Common static-RAM sizes are 2K × 8, 8K × 8, and 32K × 8, where K stands for
210 = 1024. A dynamic RAM, in which each cell is a capacitor (which leaks charges and therefore
requires continuous refreshing from the computer to maintain its value), is the read-and-write
memory that is used in large memory systems due to its lower cost and greater density. Common
dynamic-RAM packages are available in 16K-bit, 64K-bit, 256K-bit, and 1M-bit (where M stands
for mega = 220) sizes.
