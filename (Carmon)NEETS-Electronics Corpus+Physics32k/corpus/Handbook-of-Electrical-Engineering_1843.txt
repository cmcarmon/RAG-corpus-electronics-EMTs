Discrete Arrays and Polynomials
It is common practice to relate discrete arrays to polynomials for array synthesis purposes [Steinberg, 1976].
For volumetric equispaced arrays (it is only necessary that the spacing be uniform along each coordinate axis
so  that  the  spatial  sampling  periods  Di  and  Dj  along,  respectively,  the  ith  and  jth  coordinate  axes  could  be
different  for  i  â€ž  j),  the  weight  associated  with  sensors  located  at  coordinate  (i1D1, i2D2, i3D3)  is  denoted  by
w(i1, i2, i3). The function in the complex variables (z1, z2, and z3) that is associated with the sequence {w(i1,i2,i3)}
is the generating function for the sequence and is denoted by
