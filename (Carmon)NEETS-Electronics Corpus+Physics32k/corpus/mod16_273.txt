damage the substitute semiconductor device. If more than one defective semiconductor is present in the
equipment section where trouble has been localized, the semiconductor replacement method becomes
cumbersome. Several semiconductors may have to be replaced before the trouble is corrected. To
determine which stage(s) failed and which semiconductors are not defective, you must test all the
removed semiconductors. You can do this by observing whether the equipment operates correctly as you
reinsert each of the removed semiconductor devices into the equipment.
