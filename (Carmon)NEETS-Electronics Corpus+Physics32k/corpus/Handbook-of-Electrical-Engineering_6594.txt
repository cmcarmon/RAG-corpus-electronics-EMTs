Intermediate  stations  repeat  the  bits  in  the  packet  and  also “listen”  for  their  own  addresses.  If  a  station
recognizes its address in the packet header, it copies the packet. When the packet returns to the sender, it serves
as an acknowledgment, and the sender removes it from the ring, after converting the token back to “0.”
