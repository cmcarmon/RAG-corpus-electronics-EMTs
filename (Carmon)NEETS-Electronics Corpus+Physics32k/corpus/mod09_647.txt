The RC networks which have been discussed in this chapter may also be used as coupling networks. 
When an RC circuit is used as a coupling circuit, the output is taken from across the resistor. Normally, a 
long time-constant circuit is used. This, of course, will cause an integrated wave shape across the 
capacitor if the applied signal is nonsinusoidal. However, in a coupling circuit, the signal across the 
resistor should closely resemble the input signal and will if the time constant is sufficiently long. By 
referring to the diagram in figure 4-42, you can see that the voltage across the resistor closely resembles 
the input signal. Consider what would happen if a pure sine wave were applied to a long time-constant 
RC circuit (R is much greater than XC). A large percentage of the applied voltage would be developed 
across the resistor and only a small amount across the capacitor.
