A gravitic density meter has multiple components.
An resistance temperature detector (RTD) is used to acquire temperature readings. These readings are used to compensate for temperature. A [[pressure
sensor|pressure transducer]] is used to account for changes in pressure. Pressure affects the rigidity of the flexible hose. Changes in rigidity affect the way that the flexible hose deflects. The flexible hose is used to measure deflection. Larger weights cause more deflection in the flexible rubber hose. The flexible hose must be repeatable, accurate, and precise. Without these three attributes, an accurate measurement cannot be obtained.
Insulation is used to protect the flexible cartridge as well as isolate the flexible cartridge from the effects of ambient temperature. Large differentials between the ambient temperature and media temperature cause the flexible cartridge to behave differently than what is normal. The displacement measurement device needs to have a fast response time. A fast response results in more data which can be used to compensate for vibration. Gravitic density meters measure the entire volume inside the flexible cartridge. This makes the sample size very large. This large sample size leads to measurements that reflect the entire sample, because the entire sample is going to go through the hose.
