An antenna array is made of a number of individual an-
tenna elements each located at a different position in space,
with independent excitation to each input. Such an array may
provide many practical advantages over a single antenna elem-
ent. By properly designing for the individual locations and
input excitations, one can achieve radiation characteristics
that might not be normally feasible using a single antenna. If
one can also control the input excitations to the individual
elements in the real-time, the radiation characteristics of the
array, such as the pointing direction or radiation pattern, can
be changed in a dynamic manner. This will allow signiﬁcant
ﬂexibility for adjusting to a dynamically changing situation.
This chapter will analyze the basic theory of a general antenna
