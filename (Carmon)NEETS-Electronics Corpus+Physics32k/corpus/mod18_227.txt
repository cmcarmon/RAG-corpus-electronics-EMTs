Figure 2-2 shows the block diagrams and waveforms of these three synchronizers as they are used in
externally synchronized radar systems. In each case, equally spaced timing trigger pulses are produced.
The prr of each series of timing trigger pulses is determined by the operating frequency of the associated
master oscillator.
