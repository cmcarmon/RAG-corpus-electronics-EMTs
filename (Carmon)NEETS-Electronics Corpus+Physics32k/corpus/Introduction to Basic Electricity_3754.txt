Another protection device is a fuse (Figure 36-44). 
A fuse is a device that fails when an overload occurs. 
A fuse is essentially a small piece of wire between two 
metal terminals. A hollow glass cylinder holds the 
metal terminals apart and protects the wire. Typically, 
a fuse is placed in series with the primary of the power 
supply transformer. If a large current flows in the 
power supply, it causes the fuse wire to overheat and 
melt. This opens the circuit so that no more current 
can flow. The glass housing of the fuse allows a visual 
check to see whether the fuse is blown.
