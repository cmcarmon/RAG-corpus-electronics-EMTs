These closed-loop equations can also be written in the forms shown below to place the function in terms
). It will be shown later that these are very useful
of the 
parameters in specifying PLL performance. Equation (76.9) is the form used for the PLL with a passive loop
ﬁlter, and Eq. (76.10) is used for the active loop ﬁlter case.
