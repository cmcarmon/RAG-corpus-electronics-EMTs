According to new research  Planck force might be a tension constant of the space time fabric:





A

μ
ν


=


1

G

μ
ν






{\displaystyle A^{\mu \nu }={\frac {1}{G_{\mu \nu }}}}
where




A

μ
ν




{\displaystyle A^{\mu \nu }}
is the Estakhr tensor which is inverse of Einstein tensor. so then in a different representation of Einstein field equations :



8
π

T

μ
ν



A

μ
ν


=

F

p




{\displaystyle 8\pi T_{\mu \nu }A^{\mu \nu }=F_{p}}
Planck force turn out to be actually "a tension constant of the space time fabric"




F

p


=
T
=


{\displaystyle F_{p}=T=}
constant.
