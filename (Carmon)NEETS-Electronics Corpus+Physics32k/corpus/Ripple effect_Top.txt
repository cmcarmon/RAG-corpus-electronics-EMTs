A ripple effect is a situation in which, like ripples expanding across the water when an object is dropped into it, an effect from an initial state can be followed outwards incrementally.
Ripple effect is often used colloquially to mean a multiplier (economics).
In sociology, it can be observed how social interactions can affect situations not directly related to the initial interaction, and in charitable activities where information can be disseminated and passed from community to community to broaden its impact.
The concept has been applied in computer science within the field of software metrics as a complexity measure.
