The cell (fig. 1-22 view A) has a curved light-sensitive surface focused on the central anode. When
light from the direction shown strikes the sensitive surface, it emits electrons toward the anode. The more
intense the light, the greater the number of electrons emitted. When a wire is connected between the
filament and the back, or dark side of the cell, the accumulated electrons will flow to the dark side. These
electrons will eventually pass through the metal of the reflector and replace the electrons leaving the light-
sensitive surface. Thus, light energy is converted to a flow of electrons, and a usable current is developed.
