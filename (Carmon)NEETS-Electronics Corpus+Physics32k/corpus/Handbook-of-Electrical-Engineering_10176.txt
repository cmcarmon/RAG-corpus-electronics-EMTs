Traditional  economic  approaches  analyze  investments  and  costs  to  compare  alternative  projects.  Three
methods are commonly used: (1) payback period method, (2) equivalent uniform annual costs (EUAC) method,
and (3) return on investment (ROI). The payback method balances initial investment cost against net annual
cash  ﬂow  during  the  life  of  the  project  to  determine  the  time  required  to  recoup  the  investment.  Many
corporations today require relatively short (1- to 3-year) payback periods to justify an investment. In the current
environment  with  the  drive  toward  shortened  product  life  cycles,  it  is  not  unusual  to  see  payback  period
requirements of no greater than 1 year. The payback technique does not consider the time value of money and
should be considered only as a ﬁrst part attempt at justiﬁcation.
