SATELLITE OUTAGE TIME.â€”The satellite outage time specifications allow for stewing 
(moving) the earth terminal antennas, acquiring the satellite signal, and checking for circuit continuity at 
HAND OVER. (Hand over is the period of time for one earth terminal to yield control to another as a 
satellite moves out of its area of coverage.) This hand over period represents an outage time. If the control 
terminal is unable to hand over to another terminal within a specified time, other arrangements are made. 
For example, control may be retained or transferred to another terminal within the coverage area. There 
are several reasons why a terminal may be unable to assume control on time; these reasons may combine 
to increase the outage time. The difference of drift velocities of the satellites leads to bunching within a 
coverage area. This causes gaps in coverage and increases outage times. When two or more satellites 
simultaneously occupy the same space of the terminal antennas, they will interfere with each other. This 
prevents reliable communications. Other factors leading to increased outage times are SATELLITE-SUN 
CONJUNCTION (increased noise while the satellite passes near the sun), SATELLITE ECLIPSE
