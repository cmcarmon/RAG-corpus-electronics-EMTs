The HMM is imagined to ‘‘produce’’ strings of features as
follows. At each observation time (corresponding to the times
at which we extract observations), a state transition is assumed
to occur in the HMM. Upon entering the next
state,
an observation is emitted. Accordingly, there are two main
stochastic processes for which the characterizations must be
learned (inferred from data) during training. The ﬁrst random
process models the (hidden) sequence of states that occurs en
route to generating a given observation sequence. The second
models the generation of observations by the various states.
