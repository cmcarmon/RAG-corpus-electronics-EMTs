Most  of  the  emphasis  has  been  on  modiﬁcations  of  CdS/Cu(In,Ga)Se2  (or  CIGS)  heterojunction  devices.
The cross-sectional representations in Fig. 60.13 indicate the relative complexity in structure. Each of the layers,
thicknesses, interfaces, and compositions are ascribed to the engineering of the cell for optimal performance
and reliability. The best research cells have been demonstrated as high as a remarkable 18.8% for these true,
polycrystalline thin ﬁlms. Certainly, the positive and perhaps unique factors that favor this thin-ﬁlm technology
are  stability  and  large-area  production  potential  —  with  performance  characteristics  similar  to  those  for
laboratory devices. (Commercial modules with better than 12% efﬁciency and 4 ft2 areas are available, using
Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 active layers.) The variety of techniques (vacuum and non-vacuum deposition) used to make
the  cells  speaks  to  the  potential  of  low-cost  manufacturing.  Recently,  a  15% “Cd-free”  ZnO/CIGS  research
device has been reported. This and other Cu ternaries are undergoing research: CuGaSe2 and CuInS2 are prime
contenders. The issues and concerns with CuInSe2 and alloys include:
