APIs and Middleware
Application  program  interfaces  (API,  also  called  middleware)  usually  take  the  form  of  libraries  that  provide
the user with high-level functions to ease the development and to hide disparities between different technologies.
Basic APIs try to hide the command layer to the user and regroup under common interfaces the communication
with different readers. At a higher lever, an API hides the smart card operating system particularities, providing
the user with card services and with abstract concepts that ease the use of the information on the card. Thus,
card services will allow the user to select a Ô¨Åle, to read, write, and erase objects on the card, and to authenticate
the user. API can also regroup specialized functions such as cryptographic functions, purse functions, etc.
