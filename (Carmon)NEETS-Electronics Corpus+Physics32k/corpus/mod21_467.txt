A displayed waveform is a representation of a varying signal related to time. You can graphically 
plot an unknown waveform by using a system of coordinates in which the amplitude of the unknown 
signal is plotted linearly against time. An analysis of the resultant waveform provides you with valuable 
information in determining the characteristics of many electronic (and some mechanical) devices. For 
example, the waveform of a signal may indicate the presence of harmonics or parasitic oscillations, or it 
may indicate how closely a device is following a desired cycle of operation. As the parts in an amplifier 
begin to shift in value or deteriorate, waveform distortion often occurs and indicates abnormal operation 
of a circuit and often precedes circuit breakdown. Malfunctioning of electrical or electronic circuits 
within equipment can usually be traced, by waveform inspection, to a specific part or parts of the circuit 
responsible for the distorted signal. On the basis of these facts, it is apparent that there is an important 
need for test equipment that can provide a visual presentation of a waveform at the instant of its 
occurrence in a circuit.
