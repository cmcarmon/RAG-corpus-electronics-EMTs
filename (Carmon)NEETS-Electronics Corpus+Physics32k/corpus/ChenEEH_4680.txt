For repeatability in the experiments, an electric load is
added to the engine crankshaft through the alternator for the
torque disturbances. This is accomplished via 12 vehicle head-
lights, which is equivalent to the disturbance encountered
when the power steering pump or the air conditioning com-
pressor is activated. When the nominal idle speed is 611 RPM,
the load is about 12 Nm.
