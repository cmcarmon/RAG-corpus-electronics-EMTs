Another triangular lattice form is common, with circle separation as the square root of 3 times their radii. Richard Kershner showed in 1939 that no arrangement of circles can cover the plane more efficiently than this hexagonal lattice arrangement.
Two offset copies of this circle pattern makes a rhombic tiling pattern, while three copies make the original triangular pattern.
