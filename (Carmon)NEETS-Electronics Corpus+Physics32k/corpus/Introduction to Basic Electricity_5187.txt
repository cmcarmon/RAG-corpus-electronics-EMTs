When constructing a diagram, one set of signals 
that should be color-coded is power and ground. A dif-
ferent color for the positive voltage, negative voltage, 
and ground should be used, and these colors should 
not be any of the colors that have been used for other 
signals. It would be nice to use “standard” colors for 
these, but unfortunately there are several competing 
standards. Red is frequently used to indicate the posi-
tive supply voltage. Most automotive and electronic 
wiring diagrams use black to denote ground. Electron-
ics wiring that uses black for ground often uses blue 
for negative supply voltage. Green is also frequently 
used to denote ground.
