When  a  piezoelectric  material  is  stressed,  an  electric  ﬁeld  is  generated  in  the  stressed  region;  similarly,  if  an
electric ﬁeld is applied, there will be an induced stress on the material in the region of the ﬁeld. Thus, there is
a  coupling  between  mechanical  motion  and  time-varying  electric  ﬁelds.  Analysis  of  wave  propagation  in
piezoelectric  solids  should  thus  include  the  coupling  of  the  mechanical  equations  such  as  Eq.  (48.1)  with
Maxwell’s equations. In most ultrasonic problems, however, the velocity of the mechanical wave solutions is
quasi-static
slow  enough  that  the  electric  ﬁelds  can  be  described  by  a  scalar  potential 
approximation.
