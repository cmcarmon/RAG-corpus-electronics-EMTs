Knowledge acquisition is a very difﬁcult process in building
expert systems. Case-based reasoning (CBR) systems simpli-
ﬁes the process by using a collection of past problem solutions
(cases) to address new problems (Kolodner, 1993). The basic
idea underlining this approach is ‘‘what was true yesterday is
likely to be true today.’’
