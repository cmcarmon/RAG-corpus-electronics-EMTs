Unfortunately, however, there are serious problems with such a stage from a practical viewpoint. For example,
it cannot amplify down to dc because of the existence of C c, and if a larger gain is needed, the cascading of
such stages will present problems of phase shift and hence feedback stability. Furthermore, it cannot be produced
in IC form because of the incorporation of large capacitances and somewhat critical and high-valued resistors.
This leads to a reevaluation of the basic tenets of circuit design, and these may be summed up as follows: circuit
design using discrete components is largely concerned with voltage drops across resistors (as has been seen),
but the design of ICs depends extensively on currents and current sources and sinks.
