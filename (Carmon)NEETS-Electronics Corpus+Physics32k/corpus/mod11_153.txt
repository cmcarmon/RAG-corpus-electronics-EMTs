In figure 2-20, assume that a south pole is below the figure and a north pole is above the figure so 
that the magnetic field is going into the paper. When an electron is moving through space, a magnetic 
field builds around the electron just as it would around a wire when electrons are flowing through a wire. 
In figure 2-20 the magnetic field around the moving electron adds to the permanent magnetic field on the
