Sensors can also be classed as either digital or 
analogue. The output of a digital sensor can exist 
in  only  two  discrete  states,  either  ‘on’  or  ‘off’, 
‘low’  or  ‘high’,  ‘logic  1’  or  ‘logic  0’,  etc.  The 
output of an analogue sensor can take any one of 
an infinite number of voltage or current levels. It 
is thus said to be continuously variable. Table 16.3 
provides details of some common types of sensor.
