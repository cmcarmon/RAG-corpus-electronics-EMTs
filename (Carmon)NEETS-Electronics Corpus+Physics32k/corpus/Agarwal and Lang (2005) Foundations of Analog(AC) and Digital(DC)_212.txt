Now plot the i v characteristic of a battery. At low current levels, the
curve appears as a vertical line in i v space (see Figure 1.42). But if the oscillator
amplitude is increased so that substantial currents are flowing, and we make
an appropriate change in scope vertical sensitivity, the line remains straight,
but now has a definite tip, as suggested by Figure 1.43a, indicating a nonzero
series resistance. If the battery terminal voltage and current are defined as in
