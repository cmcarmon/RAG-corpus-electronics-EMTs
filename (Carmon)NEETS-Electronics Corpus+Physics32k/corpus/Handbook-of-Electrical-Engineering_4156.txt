The return stroke vertical electric ﬁeld rise to peak is com-
prised  of  two  distinguishable  parts,  evident  in  Fig. 40.19:  a
slow front immediately followed by a fast transition to peak.
For ﬁrst strokes the slow front has a duration of a few micro-
seconds and rises to typically half the peak amplitude, while
for subsequent strokes the same slow front lasts less than 1
ms  and  rises  only  to  typically  20%  of  the  peak.  The  mean
10–90%  fast  transition  time  is  about  200  ns  regardless  of
