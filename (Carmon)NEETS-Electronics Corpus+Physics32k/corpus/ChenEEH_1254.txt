In 1951, Maurice Wilkes suggested the notion of designing a
three-level computer to simplify the hardware. Prior to his
suggestion, computers used a two-level approach in which
level 1 was for programming (also known as the instruction
set architecture [ISA] level) and level 2 was for digital logic. In
Wilkesâ€™s proposed design, an unchangeable interpreter (the
microprogram) was introduced to execute the ISA level pro-
gram by interpretation. Since microprograms have a smaller
instruction set than ISA level programs, the number of hard-
ware components needed was greatly reduced. During the
1970s, the microprogram was the most dominant approach
in system design. Nowadays, the popularity of reduced instruc-
tion set computing (RISC) has virtually eliminated the need
for microprogramming. The basic hierarchy of systems using
microprogramming is illustrated in Figure 1.1.
