Texas once had separate, systemwide truck speed limits, but they were repealed in 1999 and 2011.
The truck speed limit used to be 60 mph (97 km/h) day/55 mph (89 km/h) night when the regular limit was higher. This speed limit did not apply to buses or to trucks transporting United States Postal Service mail.
Truck speed limits disappeared when all speed limits were capped at 55 mph (89 km/h) in 1974. They reappeared with the introduction of 65 mph (105 km/h) limits in 1987.
Effective September 1, 1999, Texas repealed truck speed limits on all roads except farm to market and ranch to market roads.
In 2001, a bill allowing 75 mph speed limit on roads in certain counties excluded trucks, introducing a 70 mph truck speed limit on roads with a higher limit. A bill in 2005 allowing 80 mph speed limits still excluded trucks. However, truck speed limits were fully repealed in 2011.
