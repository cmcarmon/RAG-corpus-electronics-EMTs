There are numerical challenges in computer simulation of
large-scale systems. These difﬁculties are due to the simulta-
neous solution of large numbers of differential equations. The
efﬁciency in solving a single differential equation is entirely
determined by the numerical techniques employed. However,
in analyzing a large-scale system from the component connec-
