ER3 = I3R3 = (1 A)(1 Ω) = 1 V
Let us now analyze this network using SPICE to verify our voltage ﬁgures.[2] We could ana-
lyze current as well with SPICE, but since that requires the insertion of extra components into
the circuit, and because we know that if the voltages are all the same and all the resistances
are the same, the currents must all be the same, I’ll opt for the less complex analysis. Here’s a
re-drawing of our circuit, complete with node numbers for SPICE to reference:
