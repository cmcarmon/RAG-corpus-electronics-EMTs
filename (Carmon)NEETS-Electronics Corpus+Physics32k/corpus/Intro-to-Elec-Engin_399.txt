EXAMPLE 5.1.2
The constants of an ampliﬁer are given by A = 1, Ri = 10,000 , and Ro = 100 . It is driven by
a Thévenin source with vTh(t) = VO cos ωt and RTh = 20,000 . The ampliﬁer output is connected
to a 100- load resistance. Find the power ampliﬁcation, if it is deﬁned as the ratio of the power
delivered to the load to the maximum power available from the Thévenin source.
