. Local communication: As device dimensions continue to
decrease and chip area continues to increase, the cost of
intercommunication becomes signiﬁcant in terms of both
chip real estate and transmission delay. Hence, pipelined
operation with a local bus is preferred to broadcasting
using global interconnection links. Compiler and code
generation methods need to be updated to maximize
the efﬁciency of pipelining.
