EEG Recording Techniques
Scalp recordings of spontaneous neuronal activity in the brain, identiﬁed as the EEG, allow measurement of
potential changes over time between a signal electrode and a reference electrode [Kondraski, 1986]. Compared
to other biopotentials, such as the electrocardiogram, the EEG is extremely difﬁcult for an untrained observer
to interpret. As might be expected, partially as a result of the spatial mapping of functions onto different regions
of the brain, correspondingly different waveforms are visible, depending on electrode placement. Recognizing
that  some  standardization  was  necessary  for  comparison  of  research  as  well  as  clinical  EEG  records,  the
International Federation in Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology adopted the 10–20 electrode
placement system, [Jasper, 1958]. Additional electrodes to monitor extracerebral contaminants of the EEG such
as eye movement, EKG, and muscle activity are essential. The acquisition of EEG for quantitative analysis should
also require the ability to view the EEG during collection on a polygraph or high-resolution video display.
