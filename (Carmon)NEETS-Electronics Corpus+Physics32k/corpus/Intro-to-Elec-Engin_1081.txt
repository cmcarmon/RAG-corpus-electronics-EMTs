12.4.20 A rotating electric machine with uniform air gap
has a cylindrical rotor winding with inductance
L2 = 1 H and a stator winding with inductance L1
= 3 H. The mutual inductance varies sinusoidally
with the angle θ between the winding axes, with a
maximum of 2 H. Resistances of the windings are
negligible. Compute the mean torque if the stator
current is 10 A (rms), the rotor is short-circuited,
and the angle between the winding axes is 45°.
12.4.21 The self and mutual inductances of a machine
with two windings are given by L11 = (1 +
sin θ ), L22 = 2(1 + sin θ ), and L12 = L21 =
M = (1−sin θ ). Assuming θ = 45°, and letting
coils 1 and 2 be supplied by constant currents I1
= 15 A and I2 = −4 A, respectively, ﬁnd the
following:
