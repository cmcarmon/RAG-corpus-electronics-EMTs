A typical detector/cryostat conﬁguration is shown in Fig. 116.8. The detector resides in an evacuated cryostat
and is cooled by means of a copper rod inserted into a liquid nitrogen dewar. The ﬁrst stage of ampliﬁcation
is an FET, also cooled, positioned nearby the detector. Mechanical ﬁxturing is designed to stabilize the detector
and the mechanisms for contacting it, to provide a cooling path from the detector to liquid nitrogen, and to
electrically insulate the high-voltage contact.
