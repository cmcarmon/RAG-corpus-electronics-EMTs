If the electrons of the beam were accelerated to travel faster than the waves traveling on the wire, 
bunching would occur through the effect of velocity modulation. Velocity modulation would be caused 
by the interaction between the traveling-wave fields and the electron beam. Bunching would cause the 
electrons to give up energy to the traveling wave if the fields were of the correct polarity to slow down the 
bunches. The energy from the bunches would increase the amplitude of the traveling wave in a 
progressive action that would take place all along the length of the twt, as shown in figure 2-14.
