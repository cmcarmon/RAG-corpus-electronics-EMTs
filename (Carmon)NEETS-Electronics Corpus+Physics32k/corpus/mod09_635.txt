As shown in figure 4-40 the slope of the charge curve will be very sharp. The voltage across the 
resistor will remain at 0 volts until the end of 100 microseconds. At that time, the applied voltage 
suddenly drops to 0, and the capacitor will now discharge through the resistor. At this time, the discharge 
current will be maximum causing a large discharge voltage to develop across the resistor. This is shown 
as the negative spike in figure 4-40. Since the current flow from the capacitor, which now acts like a 
source, is decreasing exponentially, the voltage across the resistor will also decrease. The resistor voltage 
will decrease exponentially to 0 volts in 5 time constants. All of this discharge action will take a total of 
50 microseconds. The discharge curve is also shown in figure 4-40. At the end of 200 microseconds, the 
action begins again. The output waveform taken across the resistor in this short time-constant circuit is an 
example of differentiation. With the square wave applied, positive and negative spikes are produced in the 
output. These spikes approximate the rate of change of the input square wave.
