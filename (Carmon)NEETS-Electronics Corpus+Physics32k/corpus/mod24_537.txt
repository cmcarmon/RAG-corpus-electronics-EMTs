Reflectance is a measure of the portion of incident light that is reflected back into the source fiber at
the point of connection. Reflectance is given as a ratio (R) of the reflected light intensity to the incident
light intensity. The reflectance ratio (R) for Fresnel reflection is discussed in chapter 4.
