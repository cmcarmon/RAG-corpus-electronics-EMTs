The 2007 Delica D:5 uses the same electronically controlled four-wheel drive system that is used on the new Outlander, which tailors front and rear wheel torque split to the driving conditions. Delica also features the same selector dial next to the shift selector that allows the driver to switch between three drive modes: 2WD, 4WD AUTO and 4WD LOCK. Mitsubishi's skid-preventing Active Stability Control (ASC) system is also present. Mitsubishi has refined the Delica's four-wheel drive management software from the Outlander by increasing the proportion of torque directed to the rear wheels during uphill driving and reducing it during smaller steering maneuvers in 4WD mode because of the vehicle's difference in wheelbase and weight compared to the Outlander. The results are better hill-climbing performance and cornering stability. Also, in LOCK mode the system senses when wheels on the diagonally opposite corners are in danger of spinning without traction during vehicle operation at low speeds. By activating the brake traction control function at lower speeds than the system in the Outlander, Mitsubishi improved the vehicle's all-terrain performance at low speeds.
