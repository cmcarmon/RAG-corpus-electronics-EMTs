Figure 12.7 illustrates several important points. As mentioned earlier, both
branch variables, or states, are sinusoidal in time. Because of this, the peaks of
one state occur at the zeros of the other. This behavior underlies the ringing
seen in Figure 12.3, and is identical to that of many other lossless second-order
oscillators, such as a spring and mass or a linearized pendulum in which mass
position and velocity are the two states. Given the definitions of positive iL and
