d < Aa, the rotor speed stays
above vs, the rotor angle reaches upost
. Then, the rotor speed
starts to increase away from vs monotonously. In this case, the
rotor speed never recovers below vs, and the rotor angle
continuously keeps increasing. The transient diverges away,
thus resulting in transient instability.
