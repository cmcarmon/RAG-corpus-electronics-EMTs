Competitive design alternatives to in-space RCS fuel transfer exist. It is possible to bring additional propellant to a space asset, and utilize the propellant for attitude control or orbital velocity change, without ever transferring the propellant to the target space asset.
The ViviSat Mission Extension Vehicle, also under development since the early 2010s, illustrates one alternative approach that would connect to the target satellite similarly to MDA SIS, via the kick motor, but will not transfer fuel. Rather, the Mission Extension Vehicle will use "its own thrusters to supply attitude control for the target." ViviSat believes their approach is more simple and can operate at lower cost than the MDA propellant transfer approach, while having the technical ability to dock with and service a greater number (90 percent) of the approximately 450 geostationary satellites in orbit. As of January 2013, no customers have signed up for a ViviSat-enabled mission extension.
In 2015, Lockheed Martin proposed the Jupiter space tug. If built, Jupiter would operate in low Earth orbit shuttling cargo carriers to and from the International Space Station, remaining on orbit indefinitely, and refueling itself from subsequent transport ships carrying later cargo carrier modules.
