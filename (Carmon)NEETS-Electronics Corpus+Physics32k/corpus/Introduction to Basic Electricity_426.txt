An electric	shock occurs when a worker becomes 
part of an electrical circuit and current flows through his 
or her body. The most common cause of  electrocution 
in the workplace is contact with  overhead wires. This is 
because when carrying equipment like poles and lad-
ders or operating equipment with height extension such 
as cranes, people can misjudge heights and distances be-
tween the ground and overhead wires.
