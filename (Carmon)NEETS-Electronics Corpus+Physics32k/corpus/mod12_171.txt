A carrier wave which has been modulated by voice or music signals is accompanied by two 
sidebands; each sideband contains individual frequencies that vary continuously. Since a wave of this 
nature is nearly impossible to analyze, you can assume in the following sections that the modulating 
signal, unless otherwise qualified, is a single-frequency, constant-amplitude sine wave.
