Average Stored Energy
The average ac energy stored in an inductor or a capacitor can be established by using the expressions for the
instantaneous  stored  energy  for  arbitrary  time  functions  in  Eq.  (3.2),  specifying  the  time  function  to  be
sinusoidal, and taking the average value of the result.
