The presence of gain and nonlinearity in the buffer become abundantly clear if
we look at its transfer characteristic. Figure 6.50 graphically plots the transfer
characteristic of a logic device that can serve as a valid buffer. The shaded
region depicts the valid region for the buffer transfer curve. The x-axis shows
input voltages and the y-axis output voltages. We can make several interesting
observations from this graph. Notice that valid input voltages result in valid
input voltages less than VIL produce output
output voltages. For example,
voltages less than VOL, and input voltages greater than VIH produce output
voltages greater than VOH. Also notice that the amplification occurs when the
