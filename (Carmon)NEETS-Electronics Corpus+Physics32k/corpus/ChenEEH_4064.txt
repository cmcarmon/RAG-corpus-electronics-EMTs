Analog information must be transformed into a digital format.
The process starts with sampling the waveform to produce a
discrete pulse-amplitude-modulated waveform (see Figure
2.3). The sampling process is usually described in a time
domain. This is an operation that is basic to digital signal
processing and digital communication. Using the sampling
