A communications system (as you will see later in this chapter) consists of two or more equipment 
sets (sets will be explained a little later). Communications systems follow the system subdivision shown 
in figure 1-1. Systems are arranged and interconnected to perform a circuit operation that cannot be 
performed by any single piece of equipment. Navy communications systems vary from the simple to the 
very complex, depending upon the circuit operations involved. Because a Navy ship must use every inch 
of available space, the communications equipment may be spread over several portions of the ship, for 
instance, receivers in one location, transmitters in another, and terminal equipment in another. The 
equipment must be installed in such a manner that it is flexible and can be used interchangeably with 
other installed communications equipment. Consequently, large numbers of sets which make up the 
shipboard communications system are installed and are capable of operating separately and 
simultaneously. Flexibility is provided through a complex arrangement of interconnections. These allow 
the physically separated equipment to be selectively switched (patched) by you into different circuit 
configurations.
