The velocity of one point relative to another is simply the difference between their velocities






V


A

/

B


=


V


A


−


V


B




{\displaystyle \mathbf {V} _{A/B}=\mathbf {V} _{A}-\mathbf {V} _{B}}

which is the difference between the components of their velocities.
If point A has velocity components





V


A


=

(


V


A

x




,

V


A

y




,

V


A

z





)



{\displaystyle \mathbf {V} _{A}=\left(V_{A_{x}},V_{A_{y}},V_{A_{z}}\right)}

and point B has velocity components





V


B


=

(


V


B

x




,

V


B

y




,

V


B

z





)



{\displaystyle \mathbf {V} _{B}=\left(V_{B_{x}},V_{B_{y}},V_{B_{z}}\right)}

then the velocity of point A relative to point B is the difference between their components:





V


A

/

B


=


V


A


−


V


B


=

(


V

−

V


B

x




,

V

y

V

,

V

z

)



{\displaystyle \mathbf {V} _{A/B}=\mathbf {V} _{A}-\mathbf {V} _{B}=\left(V_{A_{x}}-V_{B_{x}},V_{A_{y}}-V_{B_{y}},V_{A_{z}}-V_{B_{z}}\right)}

Alternatively, this same result could be obtained by computing the time derivative of the relative position vector RB/A.
In the case where the velocity is close to the speed of light c (generally within 95%), another scheme of relative velocity called rapidity, that depends on the ratio of V to c, is used in special relativity.
