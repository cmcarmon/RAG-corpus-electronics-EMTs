To optimize both starting and running, different values of the capacitor are used. One value of the capacitor
is calculated to minimize starting current and maximize starting torque, while the other is designed to maximize
efÔ¨Åciency at the operating point. A centrifugal switch handles the changeover. Such motors are built for up to
10 hp, and their cost is relatively high because of the switch and two capacitors. Figure 66.21 shows schematically
the wiring diagram of the capacitor start and run motor.
