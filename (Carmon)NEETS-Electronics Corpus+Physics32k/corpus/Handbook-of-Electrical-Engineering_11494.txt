The  MEDIX  mission  was  to  establish  a  robust  and  ﬂexible  communications  standard  for  the  exchange  of
data between heterogeneous healthcare information systems. The MIB was created mainly to allow the exchange
of data from medical instrumentation, e.g., monitoring devices and hospital information systems. Many of the
manufacturers of these devices have proprietary hardware, e.g., buses and/or software, which complicates this
exchange. Bedside terminals in the intensive care environment will beneﬁt immensely from such a standard,
since most hospitals’ ICUs and CCUs have many vendors’ equipment in their units. To effectively integrate and
manage the data are major goals of the MIB.
