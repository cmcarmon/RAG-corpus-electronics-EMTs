The device can also be electrically switched. Assuming no input intensity, the initial operating point is at point
A. By increasing the power supply voltage, the device will switch to point C. Point C like point B is in the region
of light emission and low impedance. To turn off the device, the power supply must then be reduced to zero, after
which it may be increased up to some voltage where switching occurs.
