Other Limitations
Besides limitations directly related to the MOSFET, there are some broader difﬁculties in using MOSFETs of
smaller dimension in chips involving even greater numbers of devices. Already mentioned is the increased delay
due to interconnections that are lengthening due to increasing chip area and increasing complexity of connec-
tion. The capacitive loading of MOSFETs that must drive signals down these lines can slow circuit response,
requiring extra circuitry to compensate. Another limitation is the need to isolate devices from each other [Brews,
1990; Chen 1990; Einspruch and Gildenblat, 1989; Pimbley et al., 1989; Wolf, 1995], so their actions remain
uncoupled by parasitics. As isolation structures are reduced in size to increase device densities, new parasitics
are discovered. A developing solution to this problem is the manufacture of circuits on insulating substrates,
silicon-on-insulator technology [Colinge, 1991]. To succeed, this approach must deal with new problems, such
as the electrical quality of the underlying silicon–insulator interface and the defect densities in the silicon layer
on top of this insulator.
