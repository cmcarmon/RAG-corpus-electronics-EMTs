First proposed by Clement D. Child in 1911, Child's law states that the space-charge limited current (SCLC) in a plane-parallel vacuum diode varies directly as the three-halves power of the anode voltage Va and inversely as the square of the distance d separating the cathode and the anode.
For electrons, the current density J (amperes per meter squared) is written:

.
where Ia is the anode current and S the anode surface inner area;

{\displaystyle e}

{\displaystyle m_{e}}
is its mass. The equation is also known as the "three-halves power" law and as the Child–Langmuir law. Child originally derived this equation for the case of atomic ions, which have much smaller ratios of their charge to their mass. Irving Langmuir published the application to electron currents in 1913, and extended it to the case of cylindrical cathodes and anodes.
The equation's validity is subject to the following assumptions:
Electrons travel ballistically between electrodes (i.e., no scattering).
In the interelectrode region, the space charge of any ions is negligible.
The electrons have zero velocity at the cathode surface.
The assumption of no scattering (ballistic transport) is what makes the predictions of Child–Langmuir Law different from those of Mott–Gurney Law. The latter assumes steady-state drift transport and therefore strong scattering.
