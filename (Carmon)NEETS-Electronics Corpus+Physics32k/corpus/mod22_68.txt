The fundamental difference between analog and digital computers is that digital computers deal with 
discrete quantities such as beads on an abacus, notches on a toothed wheel, or electrical pulses, while 
analog computers deal with continuous physical variables such as electrical voltages or mechanical shaft 
rotations. Computation with analog computers depends on the relation of information to a measurement
