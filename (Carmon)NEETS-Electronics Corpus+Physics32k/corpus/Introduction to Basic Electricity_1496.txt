Note that although a voltage can be produced by 
these means, the reverse is also true; that is, a voltage 
can be used to produce magnetism, chemicals, light, 
heat, and pressure. Magnetism is evident in motors, 
speakers, solenoids, and relays. Chemical activities can 
be produced through electrolysis and electroplating. 
Light is produced with lightbulbs and other optoelec-
tric devices. Heat is produced with heating elements in 
stoves, irons, and soldering irons. And voltage can be 
applied to bend or twist a crystal.
