Changing either the voltage applied to the circuit or 
the resistance in the circuit can vary the current flow 
in an electric circuit. The current changes in exact 
proportion to the change in the voltage or resistance. 
If the voltage is increased, the current also increases. 
If the voltage is decreased, the current also decreases 
(Figure 14-7). On the other hand, if the resistance is 
increased, the current decreases (Figure 14-8).
