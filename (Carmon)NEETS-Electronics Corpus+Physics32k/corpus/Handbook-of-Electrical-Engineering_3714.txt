The  nonlinearities  of  the  recording  process  can  be  largely  removed  by  a  technique  referred  to  as  ac  bias
recording. This is frequently used in analog recording in audio and video recorders. In this technique, a high-
frequency ac bias is added to the signal to be recorded. This ac bias signal is ramped from a value much larger
than the coercivity of the medium to zero. This removes the hysteretic behavior of the medium and causes it
to assume a magnetization state which represents the minimum energy state determined by the amount of Ô¨Åeld
produced by the signal to be recorded.
