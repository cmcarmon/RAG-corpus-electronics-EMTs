Problem 5.17: DSP Tricks
Sammy is faced with computing lots of discrete Fourier transforms. He will, of course, use the FFT algorithm,
but he is behind schedule and needs to get his results as quickly as possible. He gets the idea of computing
two transforms at one time by computing the transform of s (n) = s1 (n) + js2 (n), where s1 (n) and s2 (n)
are two real-valued signals of which he needs to compute the spectra. The issue is whether he can retrieve
the individual DFTs from the result or not.
