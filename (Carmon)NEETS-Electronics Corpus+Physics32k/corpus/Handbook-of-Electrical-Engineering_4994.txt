The  electron  avalanche  concept  has  also  been
applied  to  explain  breakdown  in  solids,  in  particular
to  account  for  the  observed  decrease  in  breakdown
strength  with  insulation  thickness.  Since  breakdown
due  to  electron  avalanches  involves  the  formation  of
space  charge,  space  charges  will  tend  to  modify  the
conditions for breakdown. Any destabilization of the
trapping  and  detrapping  process,  such  as  may  be
caused  by  a  perturbation  of  the  electrical  Ô¨Åeld,  will
initiate  the  breakdown  event  [LeGressus  and  Blaise,
1992].  The  detrapping  of  mobile  charge  carriers  will
be accompanied by photon emission and formation of
the plasma breakdown channel, resulting in the dissi-
pation of polarization energy. If dipole interaction is
neglected,  the  polarization  energy  due  to  a  trapped
charge is of the order of 5c eV, where c is the dielectric
susceptibility.  The  release  of  the  polarization  energy
will be accompanied by electrical tree growth in and
melting of the polymer.
