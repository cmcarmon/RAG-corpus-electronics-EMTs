The  AIN  introduces  very  powerful  service-creation  tools  which  are  used  to  produce  service-logic  scripts
(programs). In one arrangement, the service creation is done by assembling service-logic graphs from graphical
icons that represent functional components of services. The completed graph is then validated with an expert
system  and  tested  off-line  by  executing  every  leg  of  the  service-logic  graph.  At  this  point  the  service-logic
program can be downloaded into the service control point so that it is ready for execution.
