Subsection 2.5.2. The application’s many memory accesses put
a heavy load on the memory system. Therefore, the default
memory conﬁguration contains a high-speed off-chip DRAM
as bulk memory and a dual-port SRAM for the arrays that are
small enough to ﬁt there. For this conﬁguration, we have
estimated the area of the on-chip SRAM and the energy con-
sumption of both, based on the vendor’s data-sheets and how
many times each array is accessed. Then, we have also designed
a custom memory organization for this application. In con-
trast to the default memory architecture, the custom memory
organization can meet the real-time constraint with a much
lower energy consumption and area cost. Slower, smaller, and
more energy-efﬁcient memories can be used. These results,
however, are only attainable by careful systematic exploration
of the alternatives, as the following subsection shows.
