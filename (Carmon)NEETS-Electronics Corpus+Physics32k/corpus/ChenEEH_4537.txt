Although an abstract functional interpretation of the con-
nections in a system is conceptually valid, it is of no practical
value unless one has a speciÔ¨Åc and computationally viable
representation of the function. Fortunately, there is such
a representation, and the conceptual problem of inverting
or differentiating the connection function may actually be
carried out.
