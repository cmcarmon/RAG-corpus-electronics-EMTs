High permeability depends on there being many molecular magnets (or electron spin directions) that
can be aligned to provide a path for magnetic lines of force. If almost all of these available paths are
already being used, the material is magnetized and there are no more paths for additional lines of force.
The "flux density" (number of lines of force passing through a given area) is as high as it can be. This
means that the permeability of the material has decreased. When this condition is reached, the core is said
to be SATURATED because it is saturated (filled) with all the magnetic lines of force it can pass. At this
point, the core has almost the same value of permeability as air (1) instead of the much higher value of
permeability (5000) that it had when it was unmagnetized.
