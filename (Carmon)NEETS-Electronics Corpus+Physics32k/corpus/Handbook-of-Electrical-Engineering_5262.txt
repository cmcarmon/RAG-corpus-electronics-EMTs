Low- and Medium-Head Plants.
Low- and medium-head installations (Fig. 59.11) are built with reaction-
type turbines, where the water pressure is mostly converted to velocity in the turbine. The two basic classes of
reaction turbines are the propeller or Kaplan type, mostly used for low-head plants, and the Francis type, mostly
used for medium-head plants. The cross section of a typical low-head Kaplan turbine is shown in Fig. 59.13.
The vertical shaft turbine and generator are supported by a thrust bearing immersed in oil. The generator
is in the upper, watertight chamber. The turbine runner has 4 to 10 propeller types, and adjustable pitch blades.
The blades are regulated from 5 to 35 degrees by an oil-pressure-operated servo mechanism. The water is evenly
distributed along the periphery of the runner by a concrete spiral case and regulated by adjustable wicket blades.
The water is discharged from the turbine through an elbow-shaped draft tube. The conical proﬁle of the tube
reduces the water speed from the discharge speed of 10–30 ft/s to 1 ft/s to increase turbine efﬁciency.
