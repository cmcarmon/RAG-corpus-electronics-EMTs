Note that three ratios are shown to exist for the given value of :  the ratio B\C which is always
referred to as the COSINE ratio of , the ratio A\C, which is always the SINE ratio of , and the ratio
A\B, which is always the TANGENT ratio of . If   changes, all three ratios change, because the lengths
of the sides (base and altitude) change. There is a set of ratios for every increment between 0ยบ  and 90ยบ .
These angular ratios, or sine, cosine, and tangent functions, are listed for each degree and tenth of degree
in a table at the end of this appendix. In this table, the length of the hypotenuse of a triangle is considered
fixed. Thus, the ratios of length given refer to the manner in which sides A and B vary with relation to
each other and in relation to side C, as angle  is varied from 0ยบ  to 90ยบ .
