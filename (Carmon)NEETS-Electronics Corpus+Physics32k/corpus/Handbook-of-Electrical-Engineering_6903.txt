Partition noise applies to pentodes, where the source is the cathode, A is the anode (success), and B is the
grid. For transistors, the source is the emitter, A is the collector, and B represents recombination in the base.
In  photo  devices,  a  photoelectron  is  absorbed,  and  either  an  electron  is  emitted  (a  success)  or  not.  Even  a
partially silvered mirror can be considered to be a partitioner: the passing of a photon is a success and reï¬‚ection
is a failure. While the binomial model applies to partitions with destinations A and B, multinomial models are
analogous for more than two destinations.
