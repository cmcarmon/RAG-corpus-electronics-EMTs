current, which may appear to the differential scheme as a differ-
ence caused by a fault. An example of the harmonic inrush wave
shape for the magnetizing current is given in Figure 9.13. Fortu-
nately, the inrush current has a rich harmonic content, which
can be used as the basis for distinguishing between the high
currents caused by a fault and the ones caused by the inrush.
Since the magnetizing inrush is a function of both the prior
history of remanent magnetism as well as the type of the trans-
former connection, selecting the scheme for recognizing proper
levels of the harmonics needs to be carried out carefully.
