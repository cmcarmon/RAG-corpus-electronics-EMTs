In these equations, s is the conductivity of the material mea-
sured in siemens/meter. By the same argument employed in
the derivation of equations 2.30 and 2.31, it is seen that the
problem of current ﬂow in conducting bodies also satisﬁes
Laplace’s equation. This means that replacing D by J and e by
s translates every solution of Laplace’s equation for the electric
ﬁeld in the presence of perfect conductors and dielectric
objects into a solution of an equivalent electric current prob-
lem involving perfect conductors and conducting objects. The
total ﬂux of current density crossing a cross-sectional area is
called the current 1 measured in amperes. The conductance
G ¼ I=V , of a system of perfectly conducting electrodes im-
mersed in a system of interconnected conducting regions is the
direct analog of the capacitance. Its inverse is the resistance,
R ¼ 1=G, from which the more familiar form of Ohm’s law is
obtained:
