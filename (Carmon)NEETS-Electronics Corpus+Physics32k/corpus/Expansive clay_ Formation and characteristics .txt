The expanded clay is obtained by the heating of different types of clay, at a temperature of approximately 1200 Â°C, using a rotary kiln.
The principal characteristic of the expanded clay is to have a density three times smaller than normal aggregates. Usually, the density of this type of clay is 350 kg/m3.
This kind of clay has a feature that is not very common in lightweight aggregates, since it has a high capacity for thermal and acoustic insulation, which is very important for civil constructions. Also, the use of this material is economically viable.
The expanded clay is very consistent and is more resistant at high temperatures than normal aggregates, and it has higher water absorption. It has a high content of aluminium, silica, oxygen and iron.
The use of the expanded clay aggregate is economically recommended, particularly in the concrete production, since it reduces the bulk density while minimizing the total weight of the constructions. It can be concluded that the use of expanded clay is very important in civil constructions, due to its overall weight, cost and maintenance.
