A major disadvantage of the series motor is related to the speed characteristic mentioned in the last 
paragraph. The speed of a series motor with no load connected to it increases to the point where the motor 
may become damaged. Usually, either the bearings are damaged or the windings fly out of the slots in the 
armature. There is a danger to both equipment and personnel. Some load must ALWAYS be connected to 
a series motor before you turn it on. This precaution is primarily for large motors. Small motors, such as 
those used in electric hand drills, have enough internal friction to load themselves.
