Example 4.1 
 
A sine wave voltage has a maximum value of 20 V 
and  a  frequency  of  50  Hz.  Determine 
the 
instantaneous  voltage  present  (a)  2.5  ms  and  
(b) 15 ms from the start of the cycle. 
 
Solution 
 
We  can  find  the  voltage  at  any  instant  of  time 
using: 
 
v = Vmax  sin (20 t)
where Vmax = 20 V and f = 50 Hz. 
 
In (a), t = 2.5 ms, hence: 
 
v = 20  sin (20 × 50 × 0.0025) = 20 sin (0.785)
