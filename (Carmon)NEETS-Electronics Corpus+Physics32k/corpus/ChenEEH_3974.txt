Deﬁnition 1 Computing Index Space. J n
The computing index space is a set of n-dimensional integer-
valued vectors such that J n ¼ {~II ¼ (i1, i2, . . ., in)iji1, i2, . . .,
in 2 Z:l1  i1  u1, l2  i2  u2, . . .ln  in  un}, where ~aat
denotes the transpose of ~aa. In other words, J n  Z n is an
n-D polyhedron with integer-valued vertices.
