When the direct cooling of the package surface is inadequate to maintain the desired chip temperature, it is
common to attach ﬁnned heat sinks, or compact heat exchangers, to the chip package. These heat sinks can
considerably increase the wetted area but may act to reduce the convective heat transfer coefﬁcient and most
deﬁnitely introduce additional conductive resistances in the adhesive used to bond the heat sink to the package
and in the body of the heat sink. Typical air-cooled heat sinks for a single chip package with a base area of 3.3
· 3.3 cm on one side can reduce the external resistance to approximately 15 K/W in natural convection and as
low as 5 K/W for moderate forced convection velocities.
