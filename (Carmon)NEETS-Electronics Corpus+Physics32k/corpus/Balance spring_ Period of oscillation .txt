The balance spring and the balance wheel (which is usually referred to as simply "the balance") form a harmonic oscillator. The balance spring provides a restoring couple that limits and reverses the motion of the balance so it oscillates back and forth. The motion of the balance is approximately simple harmonic motion, i.e., a sinusoidal motion of constant period. Its resonant period makes it resistant to changes from perturbing forces, which is what makes it a good timekeeping device. The stiffness of the spring, its spring coefficient,

This period controls the rate of the timepiece.
