Power electronics deals with the applications of solid-state electronics for the control and
conversion of electric power. Conversion techniques require switching power semiconductor
devices on and off. The development of solid-state motor drive packages has progressed to the
point at which they can be used to solve practically any power-control problem. This section
describes fundamentals common to all electric drives: dc drives fed by controlled rectiÔ¨Åers and
choppers; squirrel-cage induction motor drives controlled by ac voltage controllers, inverters,
and cycloconverters; slip-power-controlled wound-rotor induction motor drives; and inverter-
controlled and cycloconverter-controlled synchronous motor drives, including brushless dc and
ac motor drives. Even though the detailed study of such power electronic circuits and components
would require a book in itself, some familiarity becomes important to an understanding of modern
motor applications. This section is only a very modest introduction.
