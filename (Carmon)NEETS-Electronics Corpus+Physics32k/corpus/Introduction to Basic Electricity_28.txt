Current	–	it	is	the	representation	of	the	electric	flow;	particularly,	its	focus
is	on	the	flow	of	electrons
Resistance	–	it	is	the	representation	of	the	nature	of	an	electric	flow	as	it
moves	around	the	circuit
Voltage	–	it	is	the	representation	of	the	electric	force	or	pressure;	in	general,
the	supply	comes	from	an	electric	outlet	or	a	battery
