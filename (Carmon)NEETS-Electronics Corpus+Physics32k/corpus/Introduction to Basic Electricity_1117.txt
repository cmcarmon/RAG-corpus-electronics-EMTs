When an electronics engineer designs and as-
sembles an electronic circuit, many different types of 
electronic test equipment are used to test the circuit 
for proper operation. Some types of testing equipment 
can be simulated in a virtual environment. A virtual 
environment is a computer-simulated environment 
that is displayed on a computer monitor. The main 
advantage in using simulation tools for circuit design
