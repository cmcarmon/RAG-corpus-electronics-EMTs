The original paper  identified nine candidate objects from a literature search:
Type gives the spectral classification including spectral type and luminosity class.
V (mag) means the normal apparent visual magnitude of the star.
EW(He) is the equivalent width of the 5875.6Å He I D3 line seen in emission.
The observations vary for each object. Some are X-ray measurements, others are visual, photographic, spectroscopic or photometric. The energies for the events vary from 2 × 1033 to 2 × 1038 ergs.
