(2.20)
Notice we have used our mnemonic discussed in Section 2.2.2 for writing KVL
equations. For example, in Equation 2.20, we have assigned a + polarity to v2
since we first encounter the + sign when traversing the branch with variable
v2. Similarly, we have assigned a − polarity to v1 since we first encounter
the − sign when traversing the v1 branch.
