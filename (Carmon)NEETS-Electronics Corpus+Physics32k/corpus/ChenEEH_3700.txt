Finally, the popularity of the autocorrelation method not-
withstanding, the covariance method has an important prop-
erty that can be very signiÔ¨Åcant in certain applications. In fact,
the covariance approach is precisely equivalent to the classical
least square error (LSE) solution of an overdetermined system
of equations (Golub and van Loan, 1989). This fact can be
exploited to develop alternative solutions (Deller et al., 2000;
McWhiter, 1983; Deller and Odeh, 1993).
