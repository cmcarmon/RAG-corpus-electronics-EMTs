Another  technique  for  addressing  the  growing  computational  demands  of  simulation  is  via  simulation
engines. A simulation engine can be viewed as an extension of the simulation acceleration technique of hardware
modeling. With a hardware modeler, the simulation algorithm executes in software and component evaluation
 component evaluation
executes in dedicated hardware. With a simulation engine, the simulation algorithm 
execute in dedicated hardware. Simulation engines are typically two to three orders of magnitude faster than
software simulation [Takasaki et al., 1989].
