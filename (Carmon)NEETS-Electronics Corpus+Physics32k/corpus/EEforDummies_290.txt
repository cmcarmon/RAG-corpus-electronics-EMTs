One  such  technique,  surface‐mount  technol-
ogy (SMT), allows components to be mounted 
directly to the surface of a board (think of them 
as “hitting the deck”). Surface‐mount devices, 
such as the SMT resistors shown in the photo­
graph, look a bit different from the components 
you would use to build a circuit in your garage 
because they don’t require long leads to connect 
them within a circuit. Such components use their 
own coding system to label the value of the part.
