Figure 2-27 illustrates the waveforms in a typical doubler circuit. You can see that the pulses of 
collector current are the same frequency as the input signal. These pulses of collector current energize the 
tank circuit and cause it to oscillate at twice the base signal frequency. Between the pulses of collector 
current, the tank circuit continues to oscillate. Therefore, the tank circuit receives a current pulse for every 
other cycle of its output.
