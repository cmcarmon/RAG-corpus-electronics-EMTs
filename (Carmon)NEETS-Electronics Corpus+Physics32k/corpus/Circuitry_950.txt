Example 3 
 
The  equipment  manufacturer 
in  Example  2 
recommends  testing  the  amplifier  at  a  power  of  
10  W.  Determine  the  RMS  voltage  at  the  output 
that corresponds to this power level. 
  Here we must re-arrange the formula in order to 
make V the subject. If we multiply both sides of the 
equation by Z we will have P and Z on one side of 
the equation and V2 on the other:
