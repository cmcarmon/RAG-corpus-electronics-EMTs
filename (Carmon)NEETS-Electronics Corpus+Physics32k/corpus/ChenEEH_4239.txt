WEP is implanted in 802.11b protocol and works at Layer 2
to encrypt all over the air transmission using 40/64 bit keys.
Unfortunately, these keys are not strong and are easier to
break. Furthermore, it only authenticates a device, not a user.
WPA is a security enhancement that tries to solve two prob-
lems of WEP—weak data encryption and lack of user authen-
tication capability. In order to provide a stronger encryption
algorithm, WPA employs Temporal key Integrity Protocol
(TKIP), which provides per-packet key to make the hacker’s
job more difﬁcult. WPA also implements the Extensible Au-
thentication Protocol (ESP), which works with a RADIUS
authentication server to authenticate and authorize a user
using WLAN. Virtual Private Network (VPN) can also be
used to regulate access to a company’s corporate network
from WLAN, either in a private network or public access
network. VPN is placed behind the wireless access points to
authenticate and authorize a user.
