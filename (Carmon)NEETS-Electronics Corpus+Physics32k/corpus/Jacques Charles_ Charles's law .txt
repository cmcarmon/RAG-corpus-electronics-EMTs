Charles's law (also known as the law of volumes), describing how gases tend to expand when heated, was first published by natural philosopher Joseph Louis Lussac in 1802, but he credited it to unpublished work by Jacques Charles, and named the law in his honour.
Around 1787 Charles did an experiment where he filled 5 sites to the same volume with different adds. He then raised the temperature of the sites to 80 Â°C and noticed that they all increased in volume by the same amount. This experiment was referenced by Gay-Lussac in 1802 when he published a paper on the precise relationship between the volume and temperature of a gas. Charles' law states that under constant pressure, an ideal gas' volume is proportional to its absolute temperature. The volume of a gas at constant pressure increases linearly with the absolute temperature of the gas. The formula he created was V1/T1 = V2/T2.
