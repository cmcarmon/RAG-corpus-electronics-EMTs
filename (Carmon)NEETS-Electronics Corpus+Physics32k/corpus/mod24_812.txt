If a proposed link design is not viable, the system designer will reevaluate various decisions made
earlier in the system design. These reevaluations may include using a different transmitter or receiver or
may involve redesigning the physical configuration of the link. Because there are many variables
involved in link design and analysis, it may take several iterations before the variables are combined in a
manner that ensures link operation. For more information of fiber optic system design, refer to the Navy
Fiber Optic System Design Standard.
