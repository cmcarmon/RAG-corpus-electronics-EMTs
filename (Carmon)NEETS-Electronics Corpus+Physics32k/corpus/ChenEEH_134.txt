Under fairly general conditions, it can be shown that if the
initial guess is close to the solution, then the Newton–Raphson
method converges quadratically to the solution. For the circuit
T is used, then
in Figure 3.6, if the initial guess v0 ¼ 0
½
the iterations for nodal voltage V2 are given in Table 3.2.
