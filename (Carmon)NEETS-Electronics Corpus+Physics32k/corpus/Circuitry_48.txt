where  I1 and  I2 are  the  currents  in  the  two 
conductors (in Amps), l is the parallel length of the 
conductors (in metres), d is the distance separating 
the  two  conductors  (in  metres),  F is  the  force  (in 
Newtons), and k is a constant depending  upon the 
medium in which the charges exist.
