repeats  regularly  while  the  latter  comprises  pulses 
which  constitute  a  unique  event).  Some  common 
waveforms are shown in Fig. 4.2. 
  Signals  can  be  conveyed  using  one  or  more  of 
the properties of a waveform and sent using wires, 
cables, optical and radio links. Signals can also be 
processed 
in  various  ways  using  amplifiers,  
modulators,  filters,  etc.  Signals  are  also  classified 
as  either  analogue  (continuously  variable)  or 
digital (based on discrete states).
