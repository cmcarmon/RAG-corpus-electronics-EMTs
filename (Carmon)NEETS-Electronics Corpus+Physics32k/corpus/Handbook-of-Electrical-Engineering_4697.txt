Surface acoustic wave (SAW): A  surface  acoustic  wave  (also  known  as  a  Rayleigh  wave)  is  composed  of  a
coupled compressional and shear wave. On a piezoelectric substrate there is also an electrostatic wave
which allows electroacoustic coupling. The wave is conÔ¨Åned at or near the surface and decays away rapidly
from the surface.
